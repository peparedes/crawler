"event","Well I haven't wrote in a very long time. Alot has happened in the past few months since the last time I wrote. Our football team is I think 4-4 this year and we play Oxford tomorrow so that should be interesting, We had homecoming last week and we got beat bye Valley pretty bad. Two weeks ago we were out for our fall break and I did nothing but just hang around with my friends and slept late.

I have decide to take a look at my friends and I have decide that i really don't want to miss a minute of having fun with my good friends by worrying what ppl think. I only have about 1 year and a little more than a half of school left before I go off to college so I want to become better friends with ppl who I really don't know and make up with my friends who I have had disputes with over the years. I have met alot of new ppl this year and I would like to give a shout out to three of the coolest and nicest ppl I know, Carly, Molly, and Ashley they are all different but they are all cool and nice and look foward to hanging out with them the rest of my years here with them.

I have a major Algebra 2 test tomorrow and a Spanish 2 test so I had better go study. I just wanted to update you up on my life and my thoughts. Bye"

After I waited for so long to get my liscence it seems weird that I am not 16 anymore.  Since I last wrote I went to Camp Sumatanga for a week to be a counselor, went to Montana and had tons of fun. and went back to the beach and school has started.  Well the past few weeks have been kinda stressing for me I am taking Spanish 2, Algebra 2, and Chemistry this semester so I haven't really had a good break because It seems like I always have homework in one of those classes.

"event","I found out today that one of my special friends is having to go to a nursing home. This special friend of mine is an older woman who lives in Talladega and she is one of the nicest people and most caring people in the world to everyone she knows and everyone she has ever met. She was kind of like a grandmother figure to me and I say that will all my heart. I call her Mrs. Gladiss, for ever since I remeber I have gone up and spent the day with my dad in Talladega at his office several times during the year and a few years ago during the summer it seemed like I spent at least 10 to 15 days of my summer vacation up there. Some of yall who read this may think what a loser and think that I am a little to old to be going and spending a day with my dad at his office, well I don't care and I find it pretty neat, and i know those who doubt me would find it cool to if they ever went up there and plus one good thing about it is that it lets me meet tons of state political officers which can help open doors for me in the future, well any way back to my topic the last few years the main reason for me going up there was to go to lunch with my friend Mrs. Gladiss. The routine was always the same, my dad and I would walk to the dinner bell ""a restraunt in downtown Talladega"" and would meet Mrs. Gladiss there. We would eat and talk and hug each other and then my dad and I would go back to his office and she would leave and go back to her business. Those 20 mins a day ment alot to me then and even more now. My dad would always tell me that Mrs. Gladiss would ask about me and ask about when her special friend would get to come up again. Mrs Gladiss was really big into racing and would always tell me that one day she would take me out to the nascar hall of fame at the Talladega Super Speedway. We never got that chance but she use to bring me all of this merchandice such as race car models and magazines and other things of that such. She was so good to me. Don't get the picture that the only reason I liked her was because of her giving me things because that is not it, because I would bring her things too. Mrs Gladiss had survived breast cancer earlier in her life and had another round with it 2 years ago which she survived it again. She is a real tough woman. Recently I had noticed that she was getting forgetful of things, when I would talk to her she would ask the same things over or she would say some of the same things over, I didn't really think much about it until my dad told me she was getting real bad a few weeks ago and then today when he told me that she would probably be going to live in a nursing home. I feel bad because the last time I saw her I think was in or around Spring Break if not earlier than that. I had not been going as much as I had use to since I got my liscence and all and I wish I had gotten a chance to see her in May or April. I know that I will always have a special place in my heart for her and she will have the same place in her heart for me no matter what happens. I know that God will take care of her, it may not be the way I want him too but he will watch over her every day."

"event","I guess this is kinda an appropriate time for this entry.
 I have heard people say before whats the point of friends if they just leave you someday, and I have even wondered that same thing. To me I think that friends are there for you because each friend you have some how even if you don't notice it they add something to your life. I think that is what is special about friends. They are also there for you when you need them. Most of the memories you have in your life have come from times when you were around your friends and life is made up of memories. God only knows the reason why people might come in your life for a little while and then suddenly leave you all alone. But you know that God is always your friend and though it may hurt for a while he has a good reason behind it and if the friend you have is a true friend they will try there best to see you even if they are great distances away. Well thats all I have to say. Goodnight!"

"event","I remember walking into school Aug. 1, 2001 and wondering what my Sophomore year would be like... I remember counting down the days till I turned 16 on August 21, and It was so hard to believe that I could actually drive by myself places. I remember the first pep rally of the year and getting our very first Syhiscans. And Who could forget the week of September 11th. I remember The Homecoming week when our class was the closest ever and I also remember being the ! point in spelling out Sophomores at the H/C pep rally. :) I remember being emberrassed when Alabama beat Auburn 31-7 in Auburn this year during the football season... The year went on and I remember being disapointed that I didn't ask anyone to go to Stardust especially when people even asked me but I turned them down, saying that I didn't want to go, which wasn't exactly the truth. The months went on January, Febuary, and then in March I remember going on Sing Out with my church to New Orleans, Louisiana and having alot of fun in the ""Big Easy."" April flew bye with so many things going on in it, but probably the biggest thing to me that happened in April was getting to go to prom as a Sophomore. April ended and May began and I started realizing that Things were about to change at the high school very soon, friends were going to leave, tears were going to be shed, hugs would be shared  and also I was going to be a step closer to my Senior year, though I still have to make it through my Junior year but before long They will announce the class of 2004.
This year has been alot of fun for me, I met a lot of new people and became friends with several new people, who I thought I would never get to know. The sad part is that most of the new friends I made will be leaving in a few weeks and not coming back to the highschool. I have also had several sad and unhappy times this year too, but I can't complain at all because the sad times I have had do not compare at all to sad times other people have had this year. Well that about sums up my year. The time really did fly bye and slipped away from me before I even realized it because if I had realized it was slipping away so fast I would have done things differently, but like they say ""Time Flies When You Are Having Fun!""

To the class of 2002, Congratulations you finally made it. Yall have all shared ""Good Times""(forgive me for using that :-) ) together this year, and to yall i know time went by even faster. Good luck in the coming months, I will be thinking about all of yall and missing yall all! I want to leave yall with a few quotes that are about courage and friendship.

One man with courage makes a majority.
     - President Andrew Jackson
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.
     - Jackie Robinson
Make yourself a blessing to someone. Your kind smile or pat on the back might just pull someone back from the edge.
     - Carmelia Elliot
You can preach a better sermon with your life than with your lips.
     - Oliver Goldsmith

Well I hope all of yall remember those things and yall better not forget me and come visit me next year:-) I'll miss yall! bye bye"

1. Why are people so mean?
2. Why does time fly bye so fast?
3. Why does time seem to sometime take forever?
4. Why don't people seem to understand when they are hurting you?
5. Why do some people seem to be your best friend in a small crowd or when it is just you and them?
6. Why do people ignore you and pretend you don't exist when you are around a larger crowd of people?

Well thats enough of that, and Now its time for me to go to bed and get over ""this thing or lets say this person"" that has been bothering me as of lately because I am tired of being depressed! I know I deserve better and I need to find the better part of me, because as of lately I have been tarnished. Finally I can sleep sound tonight! Everyone please pray for me and this unspoken person and that we work things out.

This has been a sad year ever since last July several people have lost loved ones way to early and it really makes you feel greatful for your life and everything good thats going on good in your life because some people aren't able to have fun and celebrate things now. It makes you thankful for all of your family anf friends and you should tell them you love them all the time.

Who needs friends, weekends, and knowledge,
Who gives time, encouragement, and care,
Who fears loneliness, spiders, and the unknown,

I really don't know why I am typing about this but I am really bored and don't have anything more exciting than this to write about. I really wish I was still in New Orleans because since coming home it had brought nothing but trouble, well at least thats what I think it will bring in the future! :-( Tomorrow is Easter Sunday, and we have our Homecoming concert at our church tomorrow night which it should be interesting. I did pretty good on my solo I had to sing on the trip well at least I think I did good.

 I'm Movin' On

I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on


I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different but they're always the same
They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on


Chorus:
I'm movin' on
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me
And I know there's no guaruntees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
Where all you can see are the years passing by
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone


I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should and lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on


I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on

Have a good day tomorrow everyone! I'm goin on a field trip and im glad! And have a safe weekend!"

I know because i have experienced this situation. Here is my experience: I like this girl alot (i kinda think she knows i like her too) and I love to be around her and do things with her and we have alot of fun together the only problem is she doesn't like me because she likes someone else and that person she likes likes her too. It is sad though because he treats her like she doesn't exist. The only time he is nice to her is when he wants something, and that is very wrong for him to do that to her. He never talks to her that much and it really makes me mad that she goes out with him. This person has even told me that i know how to treat a girl good. I know that if this girl and I ever went out that we would have a wonderful relationship because i would care about her so much and treat her like a girl is suppose to be treated. But I am hopeless that we will ever go out. I know things could and would work out good for us if we tried to have a relationship. All I wish is that she would give me a chance to show her.

I mean i didn't just sit at home tonight I went out but still i would rather have someone i could just hold and care so much for. I hate waiting to find that person and it really stinks because I never know if i have met that person yet and i was to dumb to figure out that she was right for me and i just kinda let her go, and then i wonder if i haven't met this person at all.

It was a really good service and it shows some light to the pain and suffering Jesus went through even before he was crucified. Jesus was a great person and he is the Worlds Greatest but if you were to ask him that back then he would never say he was he would just say he was a friend, thats what i think is so special about Jesus. He is always there whenever you need him and he will always be your friend. 

I really want to go to the DMB concert but they all are up north! I really wish they would come down south! 

Lastnight was the first soccer game of the season the boys and girls played Southside High. The boy's lost 7-0 and the Girl's tied 2-2. I kinda miss playing soccer this year but then there are times when I am glad i can just go home after school. 

I have been so busy lately and i really have not had that much time to unwind and relax and I am so glad that we are getting out for a 4 DAY WEEKEND! This entry has just been alot of random things but thats about how my life is!

I can feel it

I mean there have been 3 or 4 of my true friends that have been there for me no matter what, and they know who they are but this one person really makes me mad sometimes(im not gonna name any names). She just uses me and it really pisses me off and then she will be my best friend one night and then the next she will act like i dont even exist. And it really hurts me to see her do this to me. The worse part is I try to be so nice to her all the time. This person really mistreats me and i get really tired of it and it really makes me wonder what a true friend is, because she use to be the nicest person to me in the world we talked all the time but now she has changed so much. Well i dont have much else to say about this i just wish that everyone has a wonderful week! and i hope i have a good one too and things work out between myself and this friend."

Well here is a little song that i think is a good song for everyone to hear atleast once in there life, because it sends a good message:
 
If Tomorrow Never Comes  by Garth Brooks

Sometimes late at night 

I lie awake and watch her sleeping 

She's lost in peaceful dreams 

So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark 

And the thought crosses my mind 

If I never wake up in the morning 

Would she ever doubt the way I feel 

About her in my heart 


If tomorrow never comes 

Will she know how much I loved her 

Did I try in every way to show her every day 

That she's my only one 

And if my time on earth were through 

And she must face the world without me 

Is the love I gave her in the past 

Gonna be enough to last 

If tomorrow never comes 


'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 

Who never knew how much I loved them 

Now I live with the regret 

That my true feelings for them never were revealed 

So I made a promise to myself 

To say each day how much she means to me 

And avoid that circumstance 

Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel 


If tomorrow never comes 

Will she know how much I loved her 

Did I try in every way to show her every day 

That she's my only one 

And if my time on earth were through 

And she must face the world without me 

Is the love I gave her in the past 

Gonna be enough to last 

If tomorrow never comes 


So tell that someone that you love 

Just what you're thinking of 

If tomorrow never comes 


Just please think about the meaning and lyrics of this song.  God Bless! BYE!"

For the c/o 2002 time seems so little right now, they have just a few months before the graduate and move onto better things. And for me i seem to have so much time before i graduate yet I really dont because before i know it one day i will wake up and it will be the day i graduate from ole Sylacauga High. Time is so much different for different people for my sister she looks back and see's that the senior class that is graduating this year were just freshmen when she was a senior. For me i look forward to my last remaining years at shs and look toward the future. For my parents they look back at there life and look foward to the accomplishments of their two children.

What is really weird is this morning when i woke up I got me a coffee mug and some apple cider and while i was sitting there drinking it i noticed a little poem on the back of the mug(which we have had for years yet i had never taken the time to read the poem before) the poem says:  
 Live each day to the fullest. Get the most from each hour, each day, and each age of your life. Then you can look foward with confidence, and look back without regrets.      

It was so weird noticing that poem this morning after i had been thinking about time so much the past day. Well I hope everyone has a good day today and remember to live every min. of today!"

"event","As I sit here on January 1, 2002 I begin to wonder what the new year may bring. Will it be the end of the War in Afghanistan(sp?) or is it just the beginning? As we celebrate a new year we do need to think back and remember the events of the old year. We all need to be thankful for our lifes after the events of 9-11 and we need to be thankful for friend and family too. So many events changed history this year and I do hope that greater things come from the ruble from 9-11 still left in NYC and Washington D.C. 

  Though we once called sport stars and movie stars heroes now when we think of a heroe we think of the firefighters who went into the burning buildings to extenguish fires and find victims, we think about the rescue squad people who rain and shine helped try to move ruble from the remaing parts of the buildings, the police officers who try to make every event as safe as it can be and those members of the NYPD that risked there lives to save people, the former mayer of New York Rudy Giuliani; who helped keep New York City together after the events, The passengers of the airplane that crashed in Pennsylvania that helped bring that plane down so that it would not be able to do any damage to its intended target, The President Of The U.S.A. who helped hold the nation together and is doing his best to fight terrorism. Those are people that you call heroes. 

  So many things have happend this year that were sad to this country and world yet the patriotism in the U.S. and in the world is so much greater now than it had been in years. One moment that was big for me during all of this was when on the news they showed the British playing the Star Spangled Banner at the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and all the roses that were placed on the U.S. embessys gate in Germany. Those moments just touched me deep inside.

  I pray that this year will not be as tragic as 2001 was. I hope that everyone remembers to live their life to the fullest and to have a great year.
And I would like to wish the senior class of 2002 Goodluck in whatever comes your way. You only have one semester left at SHS so make many memories. I will miss yall.

This is part of a song that reminds of looking back over the year and the events that happened.

There You'll Be by Faith Hill

When I think back all these times and the dreams we left behind I'll be glad because I was blessed to get to have you in my life. When I look back on these days I'll look and see your face, your right there for me. In my dreams I'll always see you sore above the sky, in my heart they'll always be a place for you, for all my life. I'll keep a part of you with me and everywhere I am there you'll be, and everywhere I am there you'll be.
 
Happy New Year, Goodnight, and GOD BLESS!"

Lover Lay Down By Dave Mathews Band

 Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head
Slip into my lover's hands
Kiss me oh won't you kiss me now
And sleep I would inside your mouth

Don't be us too shy
Knowing it's no big surprise
That I will wait for you
I will wait for no one but you

oh please lover lay down
Spend this time with me
Together share this smile
Lover lay down

Walk with me, walk with you
Hold my hand your hands
So much we have dreamed
And you were so much younger
Hard to explain that we are stronger

A million reasons life to deny
Let's toss them away
See you and me we
Lay down look see
She and he
By my lover's side
Together share this smile
Each other's tears to cry
Together share this smile
Lover lay down

Oh please
Look please lover lay down
Oh please lover lay down
And you weep
Lover lay down
Cause it's over
Lover lay down
Say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover
Could I love you
Could you love me (4x)
Darling it's
All the same (4x)
'Til we dance away (4x)
Chasing me all around
Leading me all around
Leading me all around in circles (2x)
Say..."

"event","Today in Sunday school our teacher taught us about Grasping God's Word. It was really intresting and I just wanted to show everyone the 6 steps to grasping God's word better.
 1)Hear the Word-(Romans 10:17) Consequently faith   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of christ.
 2)Read the Word-(Revelations 1:3) Blessed is the one who reads the words of the prophecy, and blessed are thoughs who hear it and take to heart what is written in it because the time is near.
 3)Study the Word-(Acts 17:11) And the people of Berea were more open minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul's message, they searched the scriptures day after day to check on Paul and Silas to see if they were really teaching the truth.
 4)Memorize the Word(Psalm 119:11) Thy words hve I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee.
 5)Meditate on the Word(Psalm 1:2) But they delight in doing everything the Lord wants; day and night they think about his law.
 6)Do the Word(James 1:22) And remember it is a message to obey not just to listen to, if you don't obey you are only fooling yourself.

These are just 6 steps and bible verses that can help you understand God's word better. Our teacher also told us that if you read in your bible 7 mins for 7 days you will get hooked and will continue doing it out of habit, which would be really good because alot of christians have a hard time trying to find time to read your bible everyday, and if you do this you will make it a habit. Well I hope everyone who reads this takes this to consideration and i'm praying for all of yall."

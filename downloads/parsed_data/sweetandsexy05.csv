She is going to another college. and i will miss her bunches and bunches. But i know i will have friends still here for me when i need them. i know me and Vanessa's friendship will not die of 11 years we have been there and done it. Of course TCC is a journey of a dumb college but i will fly thorugh there and go to the college of my dreams. I know life has a way of  hope and faith along the road. Family issues i know that will resolve. And  realtionships and passion of the one you love you will find. iknow that God, family and friends are always there to build you up and support you in your time of need.

Well i guess why i am wrting so much is becuase of the realization i made to star last night and how things come to good  for those that love God and have faith that it will all work out. wow i even scar myself sometimes now of how i am growing up and things.

Oh and i know this may sound weird but i a have been dreaming of e int he mirror in a wedding dress. i know.

"event","ack i just couldnt sleep so here I am at 130 in the morning...at least I changed my mind and decided not to go to work.  Well today was my first day lifeguarding at the pool....let me tell you boring and cold...it rained all 1st session then it was just windy and cold...not very much fun.  Well Tania's 17th Birthday was today it was ok...i think I was just a little over reacting but who knows y dont u all tell me...soooo we were at her apartment to eat and what not b4 we went bowling cause it was a bad day and we couldnt go to he beach....so i knkew some of these ppl but i wasnt really frinds with them so i wasnt being social and i had to go to work at 5 newayz.....well we went bowling all of us in the group and I had like 15 min before i had to go to work and i paided for my game of bowling well it was my turn and Erik bpwled for me again but I didnt want him to...i paid and i wanted to bpwl b4 I had to go...plus they could have bowled for me all they wanted to when i left.  Well i got pissed off and just left right then and tere but I thik that they thought i had to go to work and nothing was worng..oh well....unfortunatly i thik that wasnt what made me so mad....I think it runs deeper than tat and it has nothing to do with Tania at all...to hard to explain and too long to type out.  So Ive been home for a total of i think possible 3 days max this entire week I dont think the parents apceriate that.  Well now whenever i am withMarcela they always bring up the whole Ryan Rigs situation...hahahahahaha its funny how there is like no situation we dont even talk ofr crying out loud....oh well they always tease me for being so infatuated with him...what can i say Im drawn to him for no reason...biut they tease me bout that and the fact that i have big boobs....i mean everything i do involves them....like the way i stand...i cant help it thats the way i always stand....and when we were at sharper Image Ashley Shire and i were sitting in the vibrating chairs dn Mike and Marcela were laughing cause my boobs kept bouncing....goodness sakes if you ever thing bout getting a boob job just say no....not worth it.  Another thing that sucks is that is all guys look at...no not my personality and awesomeness nooooo not at all they look at the boobs...sometimes i hate them so much.  youd think this stuff wouldnt hurt my feelings cause so what they are true but i dont know sometimes it does hurt.....how i can have Ryan and dont have him....or how guys dont like me for who I am...along with the Tania thing it runs deeper and has nothign to do with Marcela."

"event","So senior Salute was last Thursday showing the end of our seniors days at Cardinal Gibbons...Yes i cried not because I'll miss them, but because  there is no way to get back the experiences that I missed.  I will regret what I sadi or didn't say.  i didn't get to say i love you, I'll miss you, or even I'll see you later to any of my friends.  Of course I might be able to seethem again but who knows when I certainly dont."

"event","ok so yesterday was awesome.  The movie wasn't scary but it was at the same time ya know, like it was def. jumpy.  Ok so Kyle is the sweetest guy ever.  He is a complete gentlemen.  He paid for everything and he held the door fer me every single time and ack he always said the right thing....it was so awesome.  He knows how to be a good boyfriend you can just tell by the way he treated me.  So half way through the movie Tania (who was down by the front of the movie theater and we were in the back) ran from her seat and came and jumped on me.  She was like omg I'm so scared lol thats Tania.  yeah so after that Kyle and I went to the Pompano beach to the Seafood festival, we walked through it but nothing great so then we went down to the semi-empty part of the beach ans talked it was nice.  After a while we went to Deerfield Beach 7-11 cause if u havent noticed there isnt that many 7-11 in Ft.Lauderdale.  So we chilled there until we had to go back for curfew...and for once my curfew was 12 not 11.....that made me very happy.  Ok so my cousins Jon and Stephani are coming down for lunch today, should be fun, and I think Kyle is gonna come over too...yay for me!!!  Ok well i gotta get ready for church.  The good thing is that there is no more teaching little kids until next year woot!  Ok and sister is coming home soon Im kinda excited cause I do miss her but u kow how it gets whan u have freedopm and now u dont have ne cause u come home.

"event","i just dont understand how people can be so cruel.  First Alex kind of almost forced me to go to the guys lacross game at her school so I can meet her new ""guy"", but first we went to the mall so she could buy a Lacost shirt that was like $76 just for 1 shirt?!?!?!? now who does that(even though i love those shirts).  Then we go to the game which was ok at first other then the fact that she hates my style.  At the mall i was saying how i hate my clothes so she started going all over the place to find a new outfit to wear, cause mine just was like i dunno dark and whatever.  Foe goodness sakes it was pants with a green studed belt a gray Volcom shirt and my green and white DC shoes.  well anyways at the game she kinda payed attention to me but half the time she was talking to other people but not including me or introducing me, with her back turned to me.  Then she introduced me to Cane but he totally blew me off cause he hates his ex girlfriend but she just showed up at the game who knows why and to tell you the truth i didnt even care by then cause i was just like wow what a waste of my time this whole thing was.  So i waled away to my car and Alex was all like no dont be mad at me it isnt my fault my friends were rude ass holes, which is true, but she didnt help at all.  she just talked to them and didnt introduce me to them so of course theyre not gonna talk to me.  Now all Im gonna to have to hear is omg Cane this and Cane that, I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK!!!!  I love her but sometimes i just want to tell her to stop thinking about herself and start thinking about other people cause ya know what the world doesnt revolve around her and shit happens in your life deal with it!!!!!  My life is miserable rigt noe I honsetly cant remember the last time i was happy in the state of Florida.  Although I did have a good time yesterday... it was the first time I hung out with Marcela, Erik and Mike since i can emember I miss them, they are so much fun.  i wish more people could be like that."

I might even move up to Deleware for my senior year so I can get in state tuition, but thats not decided yet.  I want to move up there so bad though it sounds like fun.  Well on the 9th Alex wants me to go to a Lax game with her at her school at 5 but we wont be hanging out afterwords does it sound worth it? I'm not too sure if I want to go cause I will barely be seeing her...oh well.  I cant wait till April 15th FALL OUT BOY IS COMING TO THE FACTORY.  I dont care if no one goes with me but I am going.  I miss it up there so much i want to go back.  I dont care how cold it is i want to be there and not here.  Is there something wrong with that?  Well I was alsdo talking with Kelly whom I havent seen in 4 years.  Shje used to be my best friend before she moved to New Jersey and we chilled for like 3 days which was awesome.  Well we were talkin bout guys and who we wanted to just jump opn and damn it there was only 1 person I really want.  Now i think about it if i do leave theres just another reason for me to kinda make a move lol...Ill have to work on that.  My ipod died on the way home and the only thing I left at uncle Keith's was my ipod charger...damn it."

My friends all have problems and they decide they need to come to me for help, but y me???? I dont know what to do in their situations cause Im never in their situations.  And some of them are spoilied and self centered and only talk bout themselves and their problems.  Others focous on their boyfriends only..I mean they come to me all the time but I feel so left out.  They all have their hook ups or their boy friends but I have no one.  Not even a hook up or even some1 I can go to to talk to.  the one every1 goes to as no1 lol kinda funny isnt it."

We havent really chilled in the longest time I miss it.  And I'll be going to a Heat game on Saturday with Tania.  I dont like basketball but I know since Im with Tania it'll be intresting.  We like to tease people.  Ack i thought the day was never going to end Mr.Orcutt just kept going on and on and on.  Me and Jacquelyn just had that blank stare where people thoink you might have died.  I dislike spanish to who give you a test on every single verb tense youve ever had. And why do i have a book report due in History class?!?!?  Anyways i think I like repel guys cause when I went up and attempted (attempt being the the word there) he like walked away....Now I defenitely think there is something wrong with me!!!"

"event","woot!!! I got the sister to help me get this thing to like me yay!!!  In a little while i will be going to a waterpolo game at St.Andrew's high school with Alex.  She broke up with Peter last night and I feel bad cause I liked Peter but she was miserable and she kept bothering me about it.  I am probally the last person you want relationship advise from cause I've only like 3 relationships and they've lasted 2 months at the longest.  I'm running a streak of bad luck.  Ack i have to baby sit tonight but I dont want to. I wanna go out and have fun do something intresting that I haven't done in a while.  Oh well not like I have a choice.  Yesterday at the mall I told Marcela that I still like Ryan Riggs alot..lol.  I have no idea what to do I think I'll start by talking to him a little more again.  She told me that he did like me earlier but he weas afraid about getting hurt again.  Trust me I know what thats like I've been hurt many times before, but not like he has.  But how will you ever know if you never give it a chance."

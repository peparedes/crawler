however minutes my hand starting hurting again? wtf? but this time it's diffurnt. Think i might just be stressing my wrists more than normal with stress within my body. /shrug.
maybe I need to buy a new chair? or just change my habits and stuff. very odd since i haven't used a computer in about a week really, and almost within the hour it starts going sour.

my luck has been pretty terrible lately. my computer breaks. dealing with weird ass wrist problems. and the transmission of the truck is leaking fluids. and several other weird/bad things I don't care to mention.

wait...


no.


Ya know, it was kinda funny going back home. Like checking out your little sister.

wait...


no, that's terrible.


For real this time. It's funny I've made that little step that I've been away from home the longest in my life. Which didn't really occur to me until I hit downtown Baton Rouge on my way in. And as sudden as I realised that I realised what strange power trip you feel. Maybe it's just me, but I had the strange sensation to kick everyone's face in in my excitement of being home. My time sure was filled though. I almost wonder if I party harder at home than I do here in Austin... Hurmmmm...

Anyways, sorrys I didn't catch some of you. And glads I caught some of yous... wait... I don't think I saw any of my Livejournal pals. I can't remember.

Oh, I left BR at 7:30pm.
arrived at Houston at 11:15ish.... some light traffic, never went under 60mph.
got off of I-10 12:15am.
Stopped 2 times, one near Beaumont and near Bastrop.
Here by 1:47am. ish. Don't remember, but it's a record timing.
average speed was 80mph on I-10.
on hwy 71, 70mph.
cops spotted by la grande/and orange,tx. I got kinda lucky I missed one... I was hidden on the other lane behind a truck while going 85mph when I spotted one coming to the on ramp.

That's it I think. bed time. time bed."

Apparently the friends I surround myself with are pussies. Assholes and the like, hence none of them I consider to ever be close to me. Whats with worthless people these days? What the fuck? The only person I can count on is myself. Maybe it takes a great deal to earn my trust. But it's amazing how early I would trust some people who aren't even my friends. Why do I have an apprehension to trust my own goddamn freinds? Maybe they just arent mine... ""My"" friends suck. Goddamn this shit makes me depressed.

This is weird though, because maybe I saw this happening like way before, but maybe I'm just pessimistic. But maybe my pessimism is controling the path of my life? Or maybe I can see the future and I really should start listening to myself.

Regardless... I'm getting drunk and dwelling on it. Maybe I'll write a few songs.

yes, i'm having a bad case of the mondays."

my adjustment to my living setting is still adjusting, probably will be for sometime. i gotta focus and not give up.

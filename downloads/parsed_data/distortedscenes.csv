the factthat im going to college is written in stone, and i couldnt be more happy about it. no more parents, no more friends bumming up my house, no more struggling to maintain my reputation with peole i HAVE to live around. this town is so small, and the variety of experiencesi plan to take on is too big to hold inside this bumbfuck little town ;)i've always tried to tell people, or try to explain, all this strife in my life is going to lead to ONE BIG BANG! something amazing, something unforgettable. but for the right reasons? i try my best, i squash the bad things and move on, and i embrace those moments when i feel like i couldnt live up to any higher extent. only so many things can bring you up that high, but unforunately i cant count on two hands how many can bring you down. always remember, dry your eyees, burn out the anger, and use it to take action. stand as many walls in front of me as you can, i got big guns babby, and im planning on unleashing a wall of fire so bright its going to make heads spin ;)"

"event","Your path of soul development in this lifetime revolves around developing your awareness of yourself as a distinct, unique individual.  It is not enough for you to simply be who and what you are, walker, you must radiate your inner essence outwardly, express it, bring it forth in a creative way.  Although ultimately your goal is self-discovery and self-recognition, you initially have a profound need to make an impression on others and to be recognized and appreciated by the world.  In many ways you are like the eager child who delighted with the discovery of a new power or accomplishment, demands of all and sundry ""See ME! Look what I can do!"".  Of course, you do this in subtler ways (usually!).  Nevertheless, the joy of self-discovery and self-expression, and the yearning for ""strokes"", applause, and affirmation is very much present in you.  Put simply, you tend to be rather fascinated with yourself.  Your tendency to dramatize or exaggerate, and your desire to be the center of attention comes from a need to project yourself into the world in order to see yourself and what makes you special.  However, walker, your acute awareness of yourself as an individual can also lead to an excessive, constant self-consciousness which may actually inhibit your free flow of self-expression.  You may feel that you are always on stage and have to perform, or have to be the best, because you are being watched (at least by yourself!). And you can be incredibly self-centered at times, blind to other people's realities and to the larger realm of life which does not revolve around you. Find out more with your full-length reading... 

     It is imperative for you to find an area in which you can excel and shine and truly make a significant, personal contribution which matches your inner sense of nobleness.  You must have a domain, walker, one which is yours alone to shape and fashion according to your own inner dictates.  Unless you are acting from your own heart, from your own core, you are not fulfilling your destiny.  Thus, you will resist imitating and being dictated to by others, for your task is to find your own inner light and radiate it.  While young you are apt to have heroes and images of greatness in whatever form most resonates with your heart. Ultimately you must become your own hero.

something as simple as a beauitful place can hold more beauty than you think.
everything resembles that very fine line that divides birth, life, and eventual death.
its seems today that i can see the beauty in every small thing that i encounter.
and sometimes i feel that the world is full of so much beauty, so much love, that my
heart could literally explode. only though struggle have i learned to appreciate a beauty that 
has been shunned by way too many. the beauty that everything holds for the simple fact that it is what it is, and it has a purpose to do what it does. the world is driven by these things we call love and beauty. without things like these, people like me would surely not exist. i can only absorb so much before i'm overwhlemed with the appreciation that even, I AM who I AM, and just knowing i have my own purpose is enough to admire the existance of beauty all in itself <3"

you know that I'm thinking, I'm thinking...
and I have reasons to believe that I'm not the only

You say it's your way,

you lie through your teeth
you smile in your sleep [x2]

When we met you said we were the same, you know

and all the times you promised me that everything would
work out in the end, you were gravely mistaken

You lie [x4], you lie through your teeth

i am done with wondering why my entire life i have been beaten down by bad things that happen for no reason. 

i also admit that i am finally, and one hundered percent, broken.

i've never felt so alone in all of my life. and i honestly dont have a reason. id give the world to end my suffering with depression. but its clear that every wall i've built as of yet has been torn down with ease.

so... friends, foes, whoever u may be that is reading this.
i, walker hopkins, have never felt so low, i wake up everyday wondering when my purpose will be done here. in my 17 tears so far, ive had it all and lost it all too many times to count.
this is my plead for help. i can't take this anymore.
i may be leaving for a long time."

"event","Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me,
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me be.

I'll keep my jealousy close,
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy,
Then I'm not the only one lying.

Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret
And your biggest mistake.
The hand behind this pen relives a failure every day.


--it's funny, i'm in love with so many things right now, but i've never felt so lonely in my enitre life."

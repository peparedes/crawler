"event","what does it mean when the person you love the most in the world.... seems to ignore your very exsitence when around a group of certain people. When alone this person is affectionate, loving, careing, at the very least isn't afraid to recoginize your very presence.... then when around frinds...well a certain group of friends you become background noise, an annoyance, just something to appeze in hopes that you will soon go away...

anyway ...still sober, for those that give a crap.

"event","i cant do this anymore. i am too tired too stressed to alone to get anything done. i feel like i am waling uphill with a heavy wieght tied to me. my legs hurt to carry me my head hurts from being tired my chest hurts from being stressed. i want my body to fail to just colapse to fall to the floor and sleep. i close my eyes and my mind begins to scream about all the things not yet done, and about no time to do any of them, my eyes open still burning from no sleep. and i lie in the dark quiet and still hoping i dont wake anyone else. hoping i dont have to explain to them why i am sitting here in the dark. i have heard that Go wnt give me anything that i cant handle..i think God has overestimated me. i am at the emotional and physical en of my rope... i amscared that i will say or do something that will upset those around me so i say nothing. i continue forward fighing to try and smile, even that takes more energy than i have right now. for the first time since me and andrew broke up...i have been craving a drink.... just one to help me sleep. this sends shock waves of terror screaming thru my body, i resist that urge... but still no sleep comes. to mny things to do no time left to do them. if i could talk to someone tell them how desperate i feel, but noone around for that, and even if they where i know the words would never come, pride will keep me from ever doing that. if i could just break down..just cry and get it out..maybe then the slep would come, but again i dont cry....so in the dark i sit still, hoping that no one hears me sees me just let them sleep..tomorrow a quick goodbye, out the door and i m alone again..no one ever the wiser. keep smiling, keep pretending this isnt going on, maybe it will come true. 
peace be with you."

"event","So God never stops amazing me . I had to take my best friend to the Hospital last night .. praise God it turned out to be not all that bad.. BUT .... I was scared. I don't like Hospitals that much anyway .. and to have to take your friend there is by far the worst way to go the Hospital. But I was shown something, within myself and within my friendships I have developed recently. First me : for the first time I was really facing the thought of losing this amazing best friend of mine ( I always think the worst) I was completly lost at this thought. I mean who would i turn too, who could i call at all hours of the day ..and just HI, who would i be able to trust if he ever left me?? WOW I thank God that i don't have to answer any of those questions just yet. Now about the friends: what can I say ... only a TRUE friend would sit in a waiting room till 6 in the morning just to make sure that soemone else is going to be OK. I was amazed by the show of love and support, and again I must Thank God for bringing these people into my life. 
and one more thing .. I thank God that I was sober and able to be there for my best friend when he needed me ! 
Peace be with you ."

So that's cool. I am finding that if nothing else this whole ordeal between Andrew and myself .. has shown me the true meanning of friendship. And in a strange way that is really exciting to me .. to know that I really do have some very good friends in my life..now. And of course  I'm still sober ! and I'd guess I'd have to say that it was a good to be alive.

"event","So first off i have been up now for 18 hours..so this may not make any sense... sorry I work nights.. bussing tables at a cafe, from 7p to 6a... long night , butu it has a duel purpose...1) more money in my pocket ! 2) by the time I am off work ..the bars are closed . 
anyway : so after my past post I got a comment from Andrew, that I was not at all expecting. I don't want to pull out of his life because I don;t appricaite and love what he has done for me, especially after all the hell I put him thru .. to have him even want to by friend is amazing (well maybe not after all this is Andrew we are talkign about) ... I did it because ..well to be honest when we where together after all the shtuff went down, I still found myself searching, looking, hunting, to see a glimpse of the way things used to be between us.. and I kept asking him how he felt towards me.. which I could see made him uncomfortable...sad even.. I mean there is still SO much that we each need to work out.. that trying to get him to answer seomthing like that really isn;t fair to him .. I think anyway. so I made the choice to pull back from him in an attempt to protect him ( since I wasn;t able to do that before I stopped drinking) .. to give him the space and time we need to figure out just where each of us stands in regards to one another. I mean right now I want nothing more than to hold him again.. but as much as it hurts me to say .. that isn;t what we need right now. 
I am still trying to think of what is best for him... and I just seem to be making the wrong choices. I am sorry for upsetting you Andrew. I am sorry for making you feel as if your efforts to be adn remain my friend weren't  appreciated. I am sorry for not knowing what you need, what you want from me. Like I said it seems that no mater what i do in regards to Andrew I just can't get it right. 
Anyway .... I hope that made some kind of sense...
I have to shower now.. I have Church to go to.

Me and Andrew tried to be friends... after all Hell broke loos in our relationship. I love having Andrew in my life, that wont EVER change, however ... the feelings where and are to much fro me right now. I am tired of hurting , tired of causing pain, tired of not knowing what to do or what to say.. I pray an awfull lot these days, it seems to be the only time, anymore, whne I am not afraid of saying or doing the worng thing. I am lettin ggo of Andrew... in hopes that he will return..or if not at least find happiness, and the peace he has been searching for. If that isn't with me , then surely he will find it . I pray that he does anyway. But i will be honest here.. not hearing his voice, not chatting to him on-line, not having him in my life is the hardest thing I have faced... God I pray that I am doing at least SOMETHING right by making this choice.

I have prayed to God to shwo me what to do when it comes to him... but the feelings haven't chnaged any, maybe that is God's will.....? I still find myself worrying about him, if he's safe, warm, has he eaten, is he happy.. I know that he is , I know that he can take care of himself.. but I still wonder, adn worry. I'd still like to be in his life, more than I am now anyway. It's not liek the other B/F's ... I got over them rather quickly... but this time it's like I just shake the feleings. I've tried prayer, tried talking to other people (felt like I was cheating on him...strange I know) just can't get him out of my mind. OH well... maybe when I'm a bit better, ahve a few things worked out, and am back on my feet more... maybe we can ...I don't know work something out.... maybe."

I cried a whole whole bunch and just felt useless adn alone... then ..just before I fell asleep..I found myself praying, an honest open bare soul talk wiht God. I felt better afterwards. in fact i felt GREAT afterwards. Then today at work I found an AA group here in my city that is just fro Gay's! in the darkness i was directed to the light.... if I just learn to let God take the wheel..I WILL be ok! I will survive this car crash..... adn I will be stronger in the end. 
And the best part of it was...that I didn't turn to the drink fro help... I consider that my first of MANY MANY MANY challenging nights ahead. But one I met head on..made the right choice to turn to God for help ..and am happy fro doing so. 
One more day down !

"event","So this is turnning out to be my toughest day yet..... My friends are all out rehearsing, they are a group of AMAZING performers! But that leaves me alone... for the first night since it all came crashing down. The good thing is that I have NO desire to drink... just to sit and chat and laugh with my friends... I don't know maybe some alone time is what I need??? I mean I am sure if I asked them i could go sit and watch them rehearse... but they need there alone time as well. But I am hanging in there .. the night might get harder as it all goes along.. but I knew that someday this woudl happen..and I am sure that there will be nights that are MUCH worse than this one...I just need to stay focused on what is important...getting back to ME! 
So wish me luck... tonight it's just me and my monster ... 
NO WAITE  forget all that feeling sorry for myself CRAP! I'm goin gto run a hot bath soak .. maybe even read a book... but what I am NOT goin gto do is sit here on my ass and cry all night long .. that wont get me anywhere...nor will it help anything ! And if my freinds call me after rehearsal and want to hang out for a bit ...GREAT !  if not.. well I can find something PRODUCTIVE to do around here .... dishes need cleaned ! NOT going to allow myself to fall into the stupid mind trap of oh the world hates me.. because I have seen just how MUCH of the world loves and cares for me .. so no more lying to myself...

I went to church today .. it was amazing, on the ride home I felt so at peace... for the first time in a long time .. like that was so meant to be! I have had my back turned on God for so long.. and to relieze that I only had to stop and turn around to see He was still there.. behind me.. as always! What a powerfull feeling of love that is. I really liked the church .. it was the one I had been trying ot get Andrew to go to adn still am ..... more so now, after having gone, adn seen the love, the caring, the kindness that was displayed... and the feeling of acceptence I got was overwhelming. It was strange to me to see ... Lesbians (with there Daughter) to see two Gay couples sitting close in the pew in front of me.. to have a Transy stand up and give an Offeratory (I think that is what it was called.. so much to take in in one visit) I am excited about going next Sunday ... and to see myself say that is the oddest thing I have ever done(make sense??)

"event","so it finally happned. I messed this relationship up too. I tried to be a good guy... but I failed. actually when I was sober i think I was a pretty good guy...for the most part anyway. the problem was/is that I wasn't sober often enough... I have a drinking problem, I thought I had a grip on it. I should have been up front with Drew about that part of me... but that's not an easy thing to tell somebody, not for me anyway. admitting my weaknesses has never been my strong suit.. I am finding out that I am better at pointing out the flaws in others. 
Andrew if you happen to read this.... you didn't deserve to be treated that way ..not by me , not by anybody. I've been thinking of th ethings I did and said to you, last night... I don't even know for sure that it was me saying and doing it. I look around my life right now and am lost without you ... lost without your gentle touch at night, your sweet freindly smile , I will never forget the smell of your skin as you laid close to me at night, I wont forget how safe and loved I felt when you used to put your arms around me and pull me close, i even miss your itches and countless back and leg rubs. I'd give anything for you to ask me for a massage at night again. 
I need just one do-over.... one more time to get it right, one more time to learn from my mistakes and make a boyfriend somebody would be proud of.

I am scared, excited, unsure adn completly at peace with my decision. I hope that ( as I believe in my heart) that I have made the right choice. Now before ANYONE comments I already hear it .... 'if your so unsure of this then why do it"" well.... I guess my answer is .... that no great thing has ever been accomplished without first trying. I mean Thomas Edison tried over two thousand combontions before he found the filliment that worked in the light bulb... when asked how he felt about failing two thousands times b4 getting right he replied... I didn't fail I found two thousands way how NOT to make a light bulb! My point is that we don't know what tomorrow will bring... so since this feels right I need to at least try to make it work. I'm not sure if any of this even makes sense ...(I'm sure I'll hear about it if it doesn't) .... but I need to put it out there, to save this moment ..... too many emotions, to many questions (only time can answer), too many things bouncing in my head to pull them out in an orderly manor.. just puking it all out in my cyber toilet I guess.

My dogs where taken away today, I know GET OVER IT ! I hear you saying, but i'm alone for the first time in about 3 years, I mean i have a B/F (maybe..more on that later on)but for right now the house is empty, no one is begging me to play with them, feed them, take them out..just quiet. i don't know how to handle this, i mean i can do without people company...but it's been awhile since i've been alone, without animal company. And i keep thinking about how it was my fault, my fault they are gone, my fault i wasn;t man enough to keep them ..and the worst part of all of it this is the first time i have broken a promise. see i made a promise to myself that no matter what i would never give my dogs away, never let anything come before them...and when push came to shove i lost. and i'm not sure what hurts more, losing them or breaking a promise to my two best friends. and then i keep asking myself if i could give up the fight for them who's to say that i wouldn't give up the fight on a person...adn that thought scares the living crap out of me! 
now to the b/f comment of earlier .... i found something, and i'll be vague with the details because some of you will be abel to put the pieces together, and that's not fair to him.... so anyway i found soemthing, yes i was snooping and that was wrong and i admit that openly...sorry. but it still does not change what i found. he says it wasn;t him, says he had no idea how it happned .... but here's my delimma how can i trust again? how does one say one thing then do the exact opposite and expect people to still trust them? how do you make a promise and not even atempt to follow thru with it and expect people to trust you again afterwards? age really isn't an excuse...i was younger than i am now ..once... and i wasn't that way towards people . maybe it's just me...maybe i expect to much out of people? maybe there are no more people that truely believ that thier word IS their bound? maybe this is just all too much for me to digest right now ? 
I know it hurts...both events , taken alone, would hurt like hell...but togther..wow ! how do i deal with this? how do i feel? how do i react to all of this? what do i do tomorrow when it's all still there staring back at me in the mirror? why do i have to lose all three of my best friends in one day? 
oh well...i'll get thru it, like always, and i'll be stronger for having gone thru it in the end...i hope, otherwise what's the point?

My last journal entry was about how I (at age 18) had to stuff the guts of my best friend into a baggy so he could be pulled onto a boat driven to the shore and shoved into the waiting ambulance.... and all I got as comments where how I treated Drew? For the love of god it was so far from anything to do with Drew ...well anyway. I was wrong about this forum. people use any medium to express thier hatred and bitterness. I was expressing how I felt in each of my LJ entries...none of them where meant to hurt, only to explain and to allow me a medium that I truely love (which is writing) to help me better myself, sort of like thinking out loud in a textual sense... i didn't intend to encourage hatred or create a forum in which strangers could easily attack and then hide, much like the Jihadist in Iraq do .... and yes just like the Vietcong and the Iraqi Jihadist and the IRA of Ireland have learned it is a nearly impossiable form of attack from which to defend ones self, so congratulations you have won. You outsmarted me, you are better than I am . You all spell better than I do , think more clearly than I do, and react to situations better than I could ever hope to . So pat yourselves on the back....you have won. You have taken the one forum I truely felt free in and turned it into a dreaded place full of lies, snide comments, and mis informed notions that where allowed to flurish into inaccurate truths about a person that, for all you know, may or may not even be real. I hope that in the midnight hours of your memories you can smile, and I hope that the bounty of this victory keeps you all warm on cold winter nights. 
Good bye, to those of you that have read and not commented...I thank you for your time. To those of you that have read and HAVE commented I offer you my last best place of safety and freedom.... be careful with it, it's fragile and easily destroyed.

He was dead. actually he was cut open from the hip to his chest. he left behind a child, a wife, and a life full of promise. he was had a beutiful sould too. he was kind and careing, and thought of others first...now he's dead, and noone will ever know how wonderfull he was. I miss you Travis. I miss you alot. we could talk, we could laugh, we could even cry together. when I told your finacee that you where dead...she fell to her knees and cried ...as cold as this will sound. I hope soemday I'll find soembody like that. hasn't happned yet...but maybe. I miss you Travis. I miss you alot."

"event","I would gladly do ANYTHING for my friends..... even more for my B/F . why can't i get the same in return? what is it within me that prevents me from finding that one person in this world that says "" YES I am here for you now and for ever"" and actually means it? Why can't I cry ? Why do i yell..when all I really need is a hug? Why do i push ..when I need to pull? what did I do to become this way ?"

"event","how do you give away your best friend...? How do you look into the eyes that have seen you thru so much and turn your back on that? How do you look at yourself in the morning after something like that? 
I guess I'll find out..."

"event","so i had a good time lastnight..went to party , had a few drinks... made out with my B/F for awhile...then carried EVERbODY home for the night . it was hawt... I was sober and able to function, which is an accomplishment of massive proportion for me ... so yea , I'm patting myself on the back for that one ! Then I was able to get up in the middle of the night and help a VERY good friend get safely ... so yea .. I was able to be protector and friend fo rthe first time in a long time ! it felt going home after a long day shoveling snow in the pooring rain ..in nothing but a pair of thongs and flip flops ... i mean i finally felt comfortable, like for the first time in a long time I knew my role...i knew how to act & react.

"event","why do I keep everyone that I have a connection to at arms length? What is it inside of me that pushes away those I want to pull closer? is it because we really do hurt the ones we love? and if so why? is it that my past is so ingrained in me that I have no way to overcome the hurts of the past? why can i not be the person my heart tells me I should be, and can be? is all the fault of my parents, my brother, my childhood ? is it the mistakes of my youth, haunting me ..? is it fear of being hurt yet again? is it that I only see the negative? and if so, why do i only see the negative? My Buddhist studies have taught me that I am living in a cyclical life style...repeating the same mistakes over and over... but how do I get past this? How do i change my mind to see the positive when I see SO much negativity in the world that we have created? 

when i close my eyes I see a lone figure standing at the edge of a great cliff, below the smell of sea water rushes up and feels my mind with thoughts of peace and serinity. I have the urge to jump, to forever surround myself in that sweet intoxicating nothingess. I am filled with peacefullness, a great joy of finally leaving all the hurt i have created, the sea washes away all the stains that i have put on my hands, and in my heart. to jump and find myself finally at peace with the worngs i dream about. no more fears, no more worries, no more giult, no more hurting people. but i can't do it, i am not strong enough to jump, i am imprisoned by that which i long to overcome...my fear of who i really am. 

peace be with you ."

"event","Ok so how do i feel 2day...tired, but that's an always day thing for me. in general life is OK...I mean it has it's up's and it's downs...but then again doesn't everybodies??? I found out an important fact about myself recently...I look like the Grinch in Drag ... umm buut yeah .. that was fun ! I find myself in a particularly odd place in my life...I have a B/F that I love and cherish with all my heart and soul. However he has only just recently 'come out' so he's still very much in the awkward phase of not knowing just what to do or how to act/react to having a B/F . All of this I can deal with ...I hope, no I'm pretty sure I can, I think.... I'm just afraid that I am soo not the type of person to choose as your first. i have gotten myself to a point in my life where it really doesn't matter what others think of me, the friends I have ALL know that I am gay, and I think our friendship has been made closer by the reaction I got from them. Not to say that I haven't lost some very dear people over it, my g-parents, my cousins, my uncles...pretty much everybody outside of my imeddiate family. But now i want to be here for this person, and I am very much afraid that i won't know what to say or how to respond to him when the time comes that he really needs soemone to lean on . in case you couldn't tell I am very much the glass is half empty type....Anyway ...wish me luck, and pray that I have the right words, actions, deeds when/if the time ever comes..... to let this one down would break my heart! 
Peace be with you ."

"event","So I've met soem really awesome people lately... maybe even a few friends in the bunch, too early to tell. two words i never use in haste 1) friend 2) love.... but tiem will tell i guess, it always does. 
i'm an a relationship...but it feels more like we are just friends, i guess to be honest it's the whole no sex, no fooling around,barely any kissing...thing that leaves me feeling this way. It sounds very petty to say something like that, but I have needs, urges, wants, and desires... and the longer I am left hanging the more frustrated i become. maybe i am just too damn petty for my own good. But I'll hang in there ...like always, I'll adjust to accomodate the other person's life style... not meaning to sound bitter(well maybe a bit) but like I said I am getting frustrated!"

"event","ok so I've been seeing this guy for about a month now.... nothing has happned, we've just been taking things slowly, which I'm OK with ...however, something has happned. His first time called him the other night, no mention of me was made, nothing about being in a relationship was said, notta.  and at I could tell by the tone of his voice he was still VERY much into this person... he ended the conversation with ' bye babe' and closing he doesn't even use with me ! in fact he very rarely even picks up his phone when I call him. don't know how to intrepret any of this...feeling very much like we are not in a realtionship at all! morte like friends that sleep together ...and I mean we JUST slepp togther. Am i being to petty ? am I reading to much into everything?"

"event","hello God it's me Scott. It's been awhile since we've talked...too long I think. I've been doing well at keeping myself oout of trouble, and life is going good ...thank you for that . But I am need of your help, and you know me well enough to know that I wouldn't bother you unless I felt I had no other options available to me. I've met someone, you know him, He is having troubles, troubles dealing with things things I can't seem to find the words or actions to help him through. And you know me well enough to know that if i know there is a problem and I can't fix it then it drives me insane... I need your guidence to help ease his pain, his fears, and to allow his heart to open to me and feel close to you again . I know your a busy spirit and i know that there are much larger things in this world that need your attention, but he is worth your time, and I'm not asking you to fix the problem for me... just guide me to the answers, show me the way to act so that I can take on this burden and help him thru with your gentle touch. The love that I have for him is neverending and without conditions, (I learned that one from you), Please dear Heavenly Father guide me like you have in the past, help me to help him. It is in your name that I pray you to hear my favor and act upon me so that I might, in time, ease this persons suffering, and show him that the love WE feel for him will never fade, never tarnish, and never diminish. 
amen."

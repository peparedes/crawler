Saa...don't ask me why I'm in such a good mood. I don't know. But I am. That's what's important, right? Yosh!

OH! I KNOW WHY!

But I'm not telling.

Hee.

"event","Atobe-buchou, that was the BEST BIRTHDAY PARTY EVER! :D

Though...I think the present fairy might have gotten confused. I don't think <i>I</i> was supposed to get one, too. But I did! And it's the best present I've ever gotten!

I adore my new Pillow-san. ^______^

Except...I burned his dinner. ;o; That was really sad. It wound up being a good night, though, so I guess that's what's important, eh?

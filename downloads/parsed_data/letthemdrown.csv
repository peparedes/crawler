"event","There's a hatchet got a knife
When I awoke there was nothing real in this life
But dreams are so intoxicating, (intoxicating)
When you're doing this alone
Gun, rope, brick on the way
But words have no meaning when its you that says
I really do care, no baby I, I really do care!


If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?

If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?

Once a skeptic, now the critic
And you think that you finally found a place of your own.
Amongst the cold and timid souls
Where only failure knows your name

Look around for the closest to blame
But look no further than the hands beneath your arms
and now your 6 feet down, buried with, with your passing fame
And fame fame fame fame.

If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?
Innocence gone, never take friendship personal
If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?

Oh oh oh you lie
Tell me something more than what you've tried to hide
If you can't find your self, then how can I expect to find you.
Oh oh oh you cry
Tell me something more than what you tried
The greatest tragedy is not your death
But a life without reason, that your life had no purpose
(Life has no purpose!)

if you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?
Innocence gone, never take friendship personal
If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?
If you can't hold yourself together
Why should I hold you now?"

"event","When your only friends are hotel rooms
Hands are distant lullabies
If I could turn around I would tonight

These roads never seemed so long
Since your paperheart start beating leaving me suddenly alone
Will daybreak ever come?

Who's gonna call on sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

I thought you said forever
Over and over
A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion

These thoughts run through my head
Over and over
Complaints of violins become my only friends

August evenings
Bring solemn warnings
To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight

You never know what temporal days may bring
So laugh, love, live free and sing
When life is in dischord
Praise ye the lord

Who's gonna call on sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

I thought you said forever
Over and over
The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion

These thoughts run through my head
Over and over
Complaints of violins become my only friends

I thought you said forever
over and over
The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion

These thoughts run through my head
over and over
Complaints of violins become my only friends

I thought you said forever
over and over
These thoughts run through my head"

"event","Judging by these written words, gives reason to believe an evil spirit rests in that innocent girl. And the markings on her chest can tell a tale of all the lives she's affected with her hidden mistrust.
Broken down somewhere in Georgia with the thought of calling this innocent girl to let her know she's missed. But with 6 days, 6 hours, 6 minutes, left until she's gone I realize who's been with me all this time.
Judging by these written words, gives reason to believe that an evil spirit rests in that innocent girl. And the lying in her eyes can show a sign that underneath human skin is boiling red.
Burning breath; dressed in red; who else could this be, but the devil herself?
Counting down.
Lying in bed. This hotel reeks of home sickness, though, i for one am sick of going home. Vomiting. What i left behind was evil. Someone as dark as Cordele, swallowing me whole.
Where were you when i was stranded? Did your faithfulness just up and leave, or did you leave first?
(First) things first. I am not ok. From transmission parts to train wrecks her eyes haven't left by my side. Side by side was how it used to feel. But split in half and torn apart reality sets in.
Where were you when i was stranded? Did your faithfulness just go along with your heart?
(Side by side) i am not ok from transmission parts to train wrecks her eyes haven't left my side. (Side by side) But what i left behind was evil. Someone as dark as this town. Someone swallowed me whole. I am not ok.
Lying in bed. This hotel reeks of homesickness, though, i for one am sick of going home. Vomiting. I whisper out your name, but you just left me here. I whisper out your name."

"event","well its been a while sence i updated again lol seems like jason and i have been taking turns in the hospital last few weeks. thats why i havent updated cuz i was in the hospital for about 5 days i think it was and all last week iv been to busy to even come near the pc. but this whole week has been so great iv been with my jason like every sec. everything had been going really good with us its great we are really happy. and on july first(canada day) we went up to the inn to watch the fire works and that was so beautful there was soo many people there tho but jason held me in his arms and it just felt like it was just us there it  was really great and when it was all over me and jason stayed there for a while and watched the fireworks that people where shotting off across the lake. then we went for a walk and when we were walking he stopped and took both my hands in his and he gave me a nice long kiss and then he looked at me and told me that he loved me and i started crying almost right away cuz i would have never thought in a million years i would hear him say that yet cuz he told me that i had to give him some time it was so great to hear him say it tho cuz the look in his eyes told me he really did mean it and didnt just say it to make me happy. iv never felt so loved in my life even when i was in the hospital he stood up to my dad and was there everyday and night to be with me till i could come home even tho hes scared of my dad so that showed me he cared hes just the greatest guy and he asked me to go with him when he moves so i said i would so im sooo happy about that and cant wait only 10 days!!!!! :D but i need to go now my baby whats to do out and eat"

"event","wow i havent updated in a long time alot of stuff has happend from the last time i wrote. jason and i and good again he forgave me for lying to him, his been in the hospital for a week and he just got out like 3 days ago we all thought he wouldnt be coming home with us this time he got really sick i stayed at the hospital with him for a few days it was kinda nice cuz it was just the 2 of us and we just layed together and cuddle and watched tv or talked about stuff but he  slept alot well he was in there but i think it was good for him. im just happy jason got better cuz no one was ready got him to go anywhere. when we were in bed lastnight and we were just laying here talking and he was telling me all this stuff he wants to do in his life so he has to make sure he wont let the cancer get the best of him like it almost did last week. i love it when him and i just lay in bed and talk about anything and everything hes minds always going so he always has loads to talk about and most of the time i just fall a sleep listening to his voice and one of his storys. i really hope he will take me back becuz i do care and love for him very much.."

"event","Jason and i just got back home like and hour ago we had a great time it was soo much fun being with him for the weekend. we did so much stuff together we checked out his house and its soo cool and its pretty damn big too and its close to the water so thats cool as well. i met his cuzins and some of his friends that hes known all his life down there and they were telling me storys about jason lol dont think he like that to much but it was cute. he took me to some of his fav. place to be when hes down there so i thought that was really great. he took me down to the beach by a big old light house and he had dinner down there one night and he stayed there till like 3 in the morning just cuddling and looking at the stars talking about our lifes and what not that was the best night i had in a really long time and im so happ i was with him when it happend he makes me feel soo good about myself in side and out. i know the not all that pretty but he makes me feel like im the prettiest girl in the whole world and i love that feeling when we were walking around town and stuff together he would hold my hand with pride and i just loved that. the thing i like most of all about jason is when he talks to me when we are out he doesnt check out other girls or try looking at my tits he looks right in to my eyes the whole time and iv learned he had very pretty eyes i felt myself get lost in them a few times when we were talking iv never had that happen befor. but i have to go for now jason going to go take me to go get are pics.:)"

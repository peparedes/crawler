"event","I suspect I will be largely incoherent as I'm terribly sleep deprived having endured an all-nighter. I was talking to a friend via telephone for the last 4 hours and within that time-frame, I was able to purge some submerged and distinct thoughts via introspection. Perhaps I'm here to finalize a catharsis of sorts. To reclaim and recapture the Aaron Andrews that I once was. I'm one who always believes that things happen for a reason. Last Saturday, I believe I encountered an epiphany. I see no reason to create a guise of mystery nor will I create meaningless suspense. On the night of Saturday, February 27, 2010. I spent the night in jail for public intoxication. As I just typed the previous sentence I could not help but let out a little bit of a laugh, well more of a giggle. I'm known to giggle, not laugh. I guess the former sentence illustrates my personality in a nutshell. I'm a hopeless optimist who always tries to make the best out of every situation. A hopeless optimist who always tries to look on the bright side of life (sorry for the lyrical cliche). To illustrate that end I ended up socializing and reflecting on our debauchery filled idiotic misadventures with fellow inmates. Comedy was further enhanced by renditions of Jason Mraz and my personal favourite Bob Marley's Redemption Song. It now begs the question why no one brought up the idea of Akon - Locked up! I'm kidding.

Anyway, I have horribly digressed from the topic at hand. The aforementioned experience has created an illuminated strata for my existence. I finished my undergraduate degree in December and since then I have been living in an ever constant anomic state. For those who do not know, anomie refers to a sociological condition which is characterized by alienation and purposelessness. For a while, I lost my place within society, thus experiencing a loss of morality and individual consciousness-essentially I have become tremendously immature. I am living on the cusp of adolescent absurdity and herculean cultivated responsibility. I rationalized my present state of being by stating that this is my intermediary phase to let my inner child run wild for the last time. However, at 24, my inner child has certainly lost his boyish charm. My immaturity is the spoiled brat that has outgrown the novelty of tantrums and buffoonery. 

I decided not too long ago that I'm going back to school. As of right now I'm working part-time at FedEx and I find myself completely unfulfilled and aching for a life less mundane, a life less ordinary. Perhaps, I overestimated my sociology/history degree. Perhaps I still have a zest to learn and expand my horizons but I feel it is imperative for me to return to school. I have applied for masters programs and post-grad programs at college oriented towards social work.  In my more christian participatory oriented days I had dreams of making a difference; I still believe that I can make a difference. I wanted to work for change, not simply working for mere sustenance.

The quality of my writing noticeably deteriorated rapidly as I wrote that; I'm overly fatigued. What is next on the docket for today? I'm debating if I want to take a nap and rest up, or if I want to have a little escape from society and retreat to Kariya park with a latte in one hand and a novel in the other."

"event","I'm near immobile due to a sprained ankle and I have been nursing a headache for most of the day. It's 2:45 am, Saturday. I stayed in and I just finished reading Bright Shiny Morning by James Frey-finally! It's a good read and Frey definitely redeemed himself after the debacle of A Million Little Pieces. Aside from this; I'm asking myself one question; what did I do today and where did the time go? My memory fails me; time to retrace my steps.

Ok, it's all coming back to me now (excuse the Celine Dion reference). Wow, I'm terribly lame! Anyway, I digress, I went for one of my old customary activities, the Starbucks and Chapters combo. I realize how much I miss doing this activity. When I completed my undergrad, my initial reservations and fears stemmed from the realization that I would miss the friendly faces and the socializing that comes with that. I expected and anticipated not seeing those who I became close with during a four year span. I expected to miss being around people who have the same zest for my area of study, sociology. Don't get me wrong, I'd be remiss if I understated how much I truly miss all of that; but I never expected to miss the individual coffee runs, the planned meetings for lunch/dinner, the individual shopping sprees, the lectures, the hours of study, the buildings and the bus rides home in which I would gather my thoughts. In a word, the routine. The small and numerous idiosyncrasies are those that provide meaning, fulfillment and operation to our lives. It use to be one of my daily activities due to the proximity of the Go Transit Stop and the Chapters book store, it became an activity out of convenience; however, along the way, it began to mean more than that. This simple activity became indicative of my very career as a student. It was a near daily activity for me to peruse the books I wanted to read then plan my days, weeks, even months based on those books. Today, I bought Eating the Dinosaur by Chuck Closterman and Juliet, Naked by Nick Hornby. It's time to get back to the old swing of things. Who's interested in many future Chapters and Starbucks runs which in turn will help cure my lethargy? lol

In lieu of my not going out tonight. I decided to reacquaint myself with two of my favourite movies, High Fidelity and Lost In Translation. In typical Rob Gordon fashion, protagonist from High Fidelity, I'll list my five favourite movies as of right now which are obviously subject to change. The list as follows: High Fidelity, Lost in Translation, Garden State, (500) Days of summer and The Go-Getter; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind would probably make the cut any other day, same goes for Trainspotting and The Breakfast Club. Arrgh, I'm being obtuse! Clearly, I'm caught in juxtaposition; for my own sanity I'm going to make a more definitive list with my next post. The indecision is killing me!"

"event","In keeping with my self mandated objective of posting regularly, I think it's time I update. I've never been a fan of writing irrelevant and trivial information of what i did days prior;  but, frankly I'm brain-dead. So let's see where my mind takes me; I've been sick since Tuesday with a throat virus and I still have not fully recuperated although my peak of illness was Friday-Saturday, so the worst is over and i'm finally getting my voice back-I need to be outspoken as always!

In keeping with my theme of being sick and recuperating, I decided to have myself a Karate Kid I-III marathon. People who know me, understand how I think it's the greatest trilogy ever, I exclude the fourth one just because Daniel LaRusso was not in it. I mean it's like Stars Wars without Yoda. Let's just say i'm completely devastated, i never realized how awful and predictable that movie is- Daniel gets his ass-kicked, Mr Miyagi saves him, he comes back with some pathetic move, beats the bully while getting the girl. I mean it's so typical in the same sense as the power rangers. The power rangers fight against aliens, they get their ass kicked, they do the whole ""it's morphin' time act"". Power rangers beat the alien, The alien grows and then they call their plastic robots to fight-typical! Anyways, the acting is so bad, I can't fight my way out of a wet paper bag; but i'm pretty sure i could win a fight against the Karate Kid, heck, i'd predict a 30 second knock out. Despite my scathing criticism, i'd fully watch it again and i know I will. I've deduced that it's perhaps better to temper your expectations for old favourites, or else you'll just be left bitterly disappointed. I could go on about general favourites: Thundercats, Saved By The Bell, Boy Meets World, Mighty Ducks, Inspector Gadget, Captain Planet; point being that the list is endless. I've decided to avoid inflicting anymore damage to my inner child and avoid old favourites as much as possible.

Today, I feel as if i'm on the verge of death. I have not slept, although all-nighters are not new to me. I decided to stay awake as I got caught up talking with Friends from Scotland and Japan. The time difference is such a hindrance. Today was my first day of summer school, so i decided that I would show a friend around meaning i came about 6 hours early as he's taking a course here. I played basketball for 3 hours today which catalyzed me sleeping through my lecture. I already feel sore meaning i won't be able to go to my first soccer practice of the year, although i'm not terribly devastated. Anyways, I just remembered that tomorrow is toony Tuesday for the Toronto Blue Jays. I'm ensuring that i go to that!"

"event","I just realized that the majority of my posts are private. Anyways, i thought i'd update with something public for the masses, ha i exaggerate. Anyways, i'm on the final leg of my academic year, one more exam and i can relax-well relatively speaking. I'm participating in the 10k of the Mississauga Marathon, so I need to try and condition myself. It's been a while since i have played sports, worked out or did any form of cardiovascular exercise. I also decided to play in the OSL again (Ontario Soccer League); hopefully, my health holds up as i've been pretty ill for most of the year-that's another mattter for another time; but, i'm definitely planning on pushing my body to the limit. Adversity, yeah, i still laugh at it. 


Let's see what else, I definite plan on going to the UK to adhere to my going home bi-annually plan, though that will probably be in June. My friends from Scotland are planning on taking a road-trip to France which i want to be part of and i have a new cousin who i have yet to see, so there's definitely alot of incentive for me to venture home. I'll probably go to the Virgin Festival too, although if time willing, i'll gladly go to Lollapalooza too. Jays game are definitely on the agenda, i plan to go to one weekly, it's such an enthralling experience when you're watching players on your fantasy baseball team at bat, it adds such a new dimension to the game. But most of all i relish the extra time for me to read, i've yet to finish Acid House by Irvine Welsh and i made a list of 10 books I plan to buy shortly. This will probably mean even more trips to Chapters and even more Starbucks, as if i did not drink enough. 

Anyways time to study, ok I lie I'll probably work on my fantasy baseball team or watch anime."

"event","I will find any inexplicable reason to avoid studying. As i type this, i'm in my school's library waiting for friends. I was playing Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass and Tetris for a good while. Now honestly, who goes to the library in order to play video games? I was debating whether i should check my fantasy basketball team or update livejournal-something which i've been meaning to do for a while; however, i told a friend i'd finally update. Point being, i've exhausted all possible options, except study.

I wish i had something grand to announce or something interesting to share, but the reality is that i do not. I'm stuck in my own little mundane world. If you expect to get some sense of fascination from my ramblings, i urge to you stop now, you will be painfully disappointed. 

Now, are you still with me? Awesome. I recently became 22 years old, and I am realizing that i'm no longer young. I can no longer get away with my immature tendancies and laugh them off due to my age. I am struggling with the concept of being 22, when it seems like not too long ago I wanted to be a power ranger (red all the way), a ninja turtle, a professional soccer player or batman. Now, i harbour dreams of becoming a foreign diplomat, a youth social worker or a community developer. The ascention of age is characterized by leaving our havens of our many fantasy worlds to that of entering the harshness of reality characterized by the trials and tribulation of relationships of all forms, income worries and constant images of war. As a child, i looked up to the Michael Jordans and Ronaldos of the world; the catalyzing force in realizing i'm no longer a child is understanding that the new sports idols emerging are younger than I am, Leo Messi (soccer) and Kevin Durant (basketball) come to mind. As a child i'd gleefully wear my Ronaldo jersey anywhere and everywhere; however, for me to wear a Kevin Durant jersey or even a Lebron James jersey is beyond me. I struggle with the concept of idolizing someone younger than me and for something I view as trivial in the grand scheme of things. Putting a ball into a net will not end hunger, will not save lives and will not cure disease. Individuals capable of such feats are the heroes one should idolize. It's truly regretful that it takes such events as 9/11 to imprint some sense of realization of what a hero is. Sadly, the effects and realizations of ""true heroes"" are already starting to wane on society.

I have definitely matured and changed for the better throughout the years; however, i always expected a spiritual or mental epiphany at somepoint; a sudden change that placates you in to a sage-like individual, like a butterfly emerging from a cacoon. Obviously, I now know that experience is the catalyst in what moulds you into the person you are. Life is an active process of trial and error learning. My name is Aaron Leonard Andrews and everyday my ""self"" is transformed and changed."

I have decided that i am putting an end to sleeping up past 3am. This now means that i will no longer be on msn till 3 and no longer will I procastinate on school readings. From now on, i plan to be asleep by 11. 11... that sounds inconceivable coming from me, but yeah i realize that staying up till 3 is detrimental to my health and i realize that i never end up doing anything productive from the hours of 11 - 3.

Anyways, I am excited upon hearing news that JK has set a release date for HP7: deathly hallows. So excited that i completed the first book today. My goal is to reread all 6 books within this month. July is going to be an awesome month, but a sombre one also; the end of the Harry Potter is among us. Harry Potter has meant a lot more than a mere children's book. For me and countless others Harry Potter represents an escape from the mundane."

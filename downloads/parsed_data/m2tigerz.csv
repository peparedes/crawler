"event","We got ferrets! How fun is that?! There are two boys, one white and one black.  I named the white one cracker...you can guess what we were gonna name the black one but decided not to.  They are tons of fun to play with, and they're real squirly litte animals.  They hop all over the place, and they run into things a lot :-)

We (my boyf and I) have two lizards also, Tyrone and Tweak.  Tweak is mine, he's the cool one.  Tyrone used to be fun, but he's turned into a bitch and now I cant pick him up without getting clawed to death."

Spring Break was nice and relaxing- you won't be seeing me on college girls gone wild after this one.  Spent the whole week with my roommate at my grandma's house.  Got to shop, spend a couple days on the beach, tour Warner Bros. studios, go to Disneyland, and eat LOTS of sushi!!!!!

My friends and I found a duplex to live in thats right down the street where I work.  NO MORE SORORITY HOUSE!!!!  Not that I don't love the house...but it will be nice not to need a hotel room every time my boyfriend wants to visit, and sleepin in the car is no fun!

These past two weeks were awful!  I totally felt like I was falling apart.  In every class I have some major project goin on, and they all had due dates within the past week.  Add on all the stupid miniscule busy work assignments that I have, and it makes for total hell week.  I survived, barely.  Skipped a few classes here, a few chapters there...and went a couple days on only 3 hours of sleep.  Not fun!  I bought myself a new planner to get organized, that seemed to be my main problem.  If everything isnt where its supposed to be, I fall apart, plain and simple.  I'm already ready for this semester to be over with....then a few weeks after that I'll be 21!!!!  Bout damn time too.  It figures though, I'll finally be old enough to party with my friends, and all my older friends will be graduating and leaving.  

I got my tongue pierced!  Amazingly enough, it didnt hurt when I got it done.  However, its swelled bunches, so now I have issues with eating and talking.  Hopefully it will heal soon...its already been 3 days!

Hope everyone had a good Easter- I spent mine with my family and my boyfriend.  I got an easter egg :-)  Guess I'm too old for the full-out easter basket.

Its late now....bedtime...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

"event","So I didn't think my boyfriend was the romantic type.  Apparently he's got it in him somewhere, its just a matter of getting it out.  I went home this past weekend to find 3 roses and a card sitting on the coffee table.  The card (of the way fun sexy type) directed me to go to the bedroom.  There, I found another 3 roses on the pillows, and the bed was covered in rose petals.  There was another couple of notes that directed me to his pile of stuffed animals (he's a fan of the claw machine).  In the pile was a cute, blue, fuzzy puppy that he bought for me, and hidden under the collar around its neck was a beautiful heart necklace with three little swooshes in the middle that have diamonds at the end of them.  It was the same necklace that I picked out from a valentine's day flyer we got from helzberg diamonds.  How cute and romantic is that?!?!"

I have three semesters left (not counting this one) for those of you who are wondering.  I'll be student teaching in fall of '05 instead of spring '05."

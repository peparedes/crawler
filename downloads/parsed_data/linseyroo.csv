"event","Alright so I haven't posted all semester, I guess it's time. Plus I need a study break.

To sum it up...
-Ryan and I are back together. And its more amazing than it was before. Don't ask me how it happened, but we've pretty much been inseparable since the very beginning of January. 
-We have a new kitty named Hugh Heffner in honor of our beer pong table...but that has slowly evolved into Hughbert and sometime Hubous. He's the fattest cat I've ever known. And if you fall asleep on our couch...watch out!
-I took a little sister in tibs, and it was a lot of fun! It made me enjoy it a lot more, I loved getting to know her and hang out more...but it was so much work and arts and crafts, something I'm definitely NOT good at.
-Somehow I've managed to survive the 18 hours I took. Got to go on tour with Philharmonia, which was really fun, and I got to hang out with a lot of people that I normally wouldn't hang out with.
-I'm officially in the College of Business, starting this summer in Finance. Graduation date unknown :)
-The Cruise of Drunken Dreams part II was so completely amazing. I'm ready for next year. Especially because I'll be 21...
-Speaking of which, mine and Casey's 21st was so much fun! We took a taxi out to the strip and got out and started running down Tennessee Street yelling ""We're 21!!!!!!!"" It was so fun. And ever since that it has been just as fun. Love it!
-Took lots of trips this year...Winter Haven, Atlanta, Charleston, Jacksonville, Sarasota, MEXICO, NEW ORLEANS, St. George Island, and soon to be Austin! :)

Those are the big things that have happened this semester. It's been fun. Now I'm just studying for finals and getting ready to go home for the first time all year!!! I have a lot of stuff planned, so I'm really excited. Alright...back to studying!"

"event","Ok, Austin it's been way too effing long. I finally went out and saw some live music downtown! OH MY GOSH I was in HEAVEN! We started the night off right by going to Hut's for some hamburgers, went to a local CD shop downtown, and then headed to Antone's to see Alejandro Escovedo. I had never heard him before, but I agreed to go just because I haven't seen any live band in years. Opening was Nathan Singleton and his Side Show Tragedy. I loooved them. You can even hear them on my myspace now :) I seriously could've just stayed there for days listening. Next was a band I wasn't too crazy about, but then Alejandro came out...it wasn't anything like I expected. He kinda looked like a classy Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite...but played rock and could really jam out...it was really cool. He played with an electric cello...that would take over the lead guitar sometimes. It was really cool. And he had lots of cool stories cuz he's been playing for foreverrrr. It was so fun...I really wanna start trying to go to shows in Tallahassee more. This is why I love Austin."

"event","I'm home!!! Home is amazing and I love it. My flight home was probably the best I've ever had...even though I almost missed my flight in Atlanta cuz I was too busy playing on my laptop...oops! My flight got in early AND my bags were one of the first ones off. The next day we drove to Oklahoma...got some amazing Mexican food and I got to see my Uncle Greg!! My cousins looked so old...Ian didn't even know who I was cuz he wouldn't remember the last time he saw me. My grandparents were as slow as ever...I'm talkin we can't leave the house til 3pm because they can't get ready fast enough. It was definitely a different lifestyle for those 4 days...and made me realize that I'm going to be an active old person when I get old :) But it was still nice being with the fam. OH and I was DD for some of my fam when they went out to a bar...that was a lot of fun!! haha...Now I'm finalyl back at my real home...spent lots of quality time with my Andrew, many stories from that. Now for the sad news. We were driving around Austin today, and I was honestly completely LOST because we have 50 million new highways and toll roads and I had absolutely NO idea where we were. It's really sad to be lost in the city you grew up in. Really really sad. Everytime I come home they make another drastic change so I don't even recognize it...now there's all these new roads that I don't even know where they go to!!! But anyway. I'm babysitting for my neighbs tomorrow..it'll be nice to catch up with them...makin more Christmas cookies! Then Saturday it's off to Temple for my mom's family's Christmas...Sunday is Christmas Eve which means dinner at China Cafe, goin to see all the lights downtown..and possibly snow!?!? We'll see. And for the great news...I might get to go see the longhorns play in the Alamobowl on the 30th...crossing my fingers for tickets :) I've been running on the new trail (well...its new to me) in my neighborhood...it goes by the golf course and its really nice. Finished my Christmas shopping. Saw Stranger Than Fiction at the Alamo Drafthouse...it was really really good, I recommend it. Lovin seeing my doggies!! Belle is gettin old and gray...it's sad, but she's still my puppy. Ok so that's my week in a nutshell. Sorry its so random."

"event","Life is a roller coaster...that about sums it up. Last week Bob lost it's baby kitty and bitchiest roommate and it was one of the hardest things we've all been through in a while...it was very traumatizing and so so sad. But it gets better every day...even though every little thing in this house reminds us of her...like our ghetto christmas tree...and opening up the front door and expecting her to come greet us and try to hug us like she always did...i dunno. I didn't know how much I loved that cat until she left us. Bob is definitely not the same.

But good news...I'm obsessed with my friends. Like no joke. I would so much rather be with friends than go out with a guy...which might be bad cuz I could be missing out on something really good...but I know my friends are never gonna break my heart and I don't wanna miss out on anything with them.

Bub is my new favorite word.


Home on Friday! Then it's off to Oklahoma to see my Uncle Greg and Aunt Cindy!!! I haven't seen them since before I graduated high school...and Greg is my faaaav! So I'm real excited about that. Then it's pretty much hangin out with the fam and Andrew for the next 2 weeks, then it's back to Tally for new year's with the regzzzzzzzz. My heart really does belong to the regz. Love it.

"event","IT'S OVER!!! My recitals are over...my junior recital..the one I was worried about...I couldn't have asked it to go any better, and it was even more amazing cuz all of my best friends were there and it made me feel really good :) After listening to the recording...mistakes I made were not noticeable...so I'm relaly happy. The even better news...I think it may have (knock on wood) gotten rid of my nerves. Tonight for the second recital, I went to play and I was really not that nervous at all. I didn't play as well, because it had not been my focus at all, but it was a great performance just in that I was nervous at all...it was the weirdest feeling. 

My mom left this morning, it was sad, but I'll be home in about a month, and I can't freakin wait! My life just got a whole lot easier today, I don't really have any worries except for keepin my grades up now. LOVE IT!

In other news...Jeff Bowden resigned today...Meghan called and told me but when she told me I heard ""Jeff Bowden died today!"" i was like what!?!?!? Anywayyyyyyyy

She told me she wanted to take me to Osaka...and I didn't complain! She's the person I can count on for absolutely anything, and she's pretty much amazing. 

Tomorrow is the recital. So ready to get it over with!!! I played Lookout for my mom today..she was kinda shocked...it was funny :)

The Cruise of Drunken Dreams part II is officially booked for spring break 07! 

Me and Case talk about our 21st birthday pretty much every day. We are lame.

Both my teams broke my heart yesterday...at least Texas had an excuse. Colt got hurt the first drive of the game. We had 2 perfectly functioning QBs, but no. We had fun in the stands though...I pretty much went crazy after being soaked and cold for 3 hours...so it was fun!

Like earlier last week the boys watned to have a bonfire but then ditch us last minute. And it's been happening so much lately that everytime we talk about doing something, I doubt that it will even go through, just so I don't get my hopes up. It's one of my biggest peeves in the world...and I know I'm guilty of it every now and then, but I really try to if I make plans to follow through, because I know it sucks being on the other end every time. And white lies to cover it up don't make it any better. Anywaysssssssss......

-first, the dryer vent got unplugged so all the heat would just go straight into the bathroom
-both toilets are messed up so you can't use the flusher, you have pull the thing up to flush
-steph and case's shower shocks them everytime they turn a knob
-their bathroom and steph's room both don't have knobs for the doors
-there is a new smell everytime we walk in
-the plug that the microwave was in doesn't work, and we can't find the circuit breaker in our house
-the part on the ac that displays the temperature got ripped off
-the cat got stuck in the dryer today cuz she crawls through the vent
-THEN a possum got stuck........thank you neighbors!!!

i could go on and on! but somehow we have come to love all the things wrong with our house...and look forward to finding out what will be wrong every new day!


other than all that mess...here's some random info

"event","I'm on cloud 9 right now for no apparent reason. I'm so happy with life right now...school is going really really well, I'm managing my time, preparing for my recital which is coming along better than I thought. I'm actually enjoying practicing and I want to practice for once in my life. And it's weird...I still don't really want to make a career out of music, but I'm just enjoying it for once and doing it for me. Which is the way it should have been all along.

Looking back a year ago, my life was completely different. I lived in a different place, I only had one major and a different life plan, I had a boyfriend...and now all of those things are the exact opposite. But I'm so happy. I am constantly surrounded by the most amazing friends...words cant even express how amazing they are. I'm keeping myself in good shape...I start almost every day with a run, and it makes my days so much better...even if I'm tired it wakes me up and gets the endorphins going. I am happy being single for once...I thought about it, and at this point in my life I don't want a guy...I love being able to go out and have fun and not worry about asking if it's okay to go out and do those things. I'm just happy and I love it!"

"event","This weekend was completely amazing. Friday was a cookout at Betty and then Harry. We sat out in lawn chairs all afternoon drinkin beer...I made my queso..and well after that is up for you to decide! Saturday morning we woke up and I drove Steph over to Betty so she could get her car...where we talked about everything that had happened the night before. LOVE IT! We had so much fun that we decided to do it all over again on Saturday. Except this time my queso broke their microwave. oops! We then went to the pub where Steph and I somehow were banded as 21, and we ran into the guys I have a crush on and talked to them the whole night :) It was a blast and it was so nice to wake up and not have to worry about a football game taking up the entire day.

More exciting news:
-my junior recital is on nov. 13th and my mom just booked a flight to come and see it!!!!!!!!!!

and finally....life is picking up so fast i don't even know what to do with myself. I feel like there's so much I need to do in the next month and I have no idea how I'll do it all...but I somehow always seem to find a way."

The flight to Houston was fine (well I found out later that it didn't really). I had a 2 hour layover there, and then we load the plane and everything is fine. We leave the gate....THREE hours later we are in the air. We sat on the runway because of rain...it was awful. And the whole time my parents are waiting at the airport in Austin and have no idea why or when I'll be there. So I finalyyyy get to Austin and get to the baggage claim to get my bag. Oh wait...my bag wasn't there. On the screen it said ""last bag on"" so that meant my bag did not make it to Austin. Andddd I had left my baggage claim ticket on the plane. AWESOME! The lady wasn't much help...gave us a number to call later to see if they find it. We call about 2 hours later...the lady on the phone was a lot more helpful...somehow even though I was on Continental, my bag made it onto a Delta flight, so it got delivered to my house much, much later that night. My neighbor is a pilot for Continental and has never heard of that happening before. I HATE FLYING!!!

But on a happier note, I got to see Andrew...and his gf Alicia yesterday, and she was nice to me this time. I miss him so much and wish he was aroudn more. Today we went to Six Flags and that was a blast. Tonight we went to get Mexican food with the fam, my parents were gettin drunk and that was also a blast, hah! And now I'm just hangin out...I'll be up in 7 hours to get my teeth out, hooray! So that's my visit so far, don't be jeal :)"

We didn't know anyone there, so I'm sure we pissed a few people off, I know Aff pissed one girl off lol, and I tried convincing everyone my name was Stephanie too. 

Yesterday was a blast too. I woke up and Julez called me to go to Backyard Burgers, then we went to Bob to hang out until the Garnet and Gold game. It was lots of fun, didn't pay much attention to the actual game. We got new drum majors, congrats to them! Then I went home and took a nap with Tank :) I'm dogsitting for Ryan and I have become slightly attached to this dog! Then I had to go to the USO concert, and then it was out for Ashley's bday party! The cops came, so we moved it to Betty...then the SAME cops came and busted that party too. It was a lot of fun though. We made green beans and apparently I put too much garlic in them...oops.

So I don't know if this would piss anyone else off, or if I'm being too sensitive, but it really hurt my feelings. Ryan forgot his cell phone charger in Tallahassee. So the only way we could talk was if he was home at his house. He was going to a party, and told me he would call me at ""9:59"" and then if i didn't answer he'd call me at 10, then again at 10:30. Now I'm not an idiot. I know how easy it is to ask someone at a party if you can borrow their phone, especially if everyone there are your best friends from high school. At 4am he calls me from his house. I didn't answer cuz it would've been a bad idea. And then he IMs me saying he tried so hard to call me but he just couldn't. It hurts my feelings because he nows I'm already worried cuz his ex is gonna be there, and he doesn't even try to call me from the party. I'm freakin babysitting his dog, I've done everything for this dog and he wont give me the time of day cuz he's at a party. Whatever, sorry just had to vent."

"event","School is getting quite hectic...but today it hit me that the end is sooo close and it will come by so fast. I'm getting soo homesick again and it doesn't help that my parents have been tellin me about all the stuff they wanna do when I get back...hiking, going to the cabin on the river, lots and family and eating, and of course I gotta see my friends!! I'm so so excited.

I've also become very lazy with school. I practice the complete bare minimum to get me by. I'm doing the bare minimum and somehow I'm doing better than when I cared with school! I decided yesterday that I'm gonna do the double major instead. I'll be here longer, but I'm really in no rush. And yesterday in the union I got offered a job at Abercrombie! I only have to work 1 shift once every other week or so, so I can still get another job, but also have the discount :) I'm looking forward to summer. Money...taking classes, but one I'm takin with Steph and the others are going to be fun cuz its for my new major!

I'm really proud of myself, cuz even after the cruise I've been really good about going to the gym. It's not what I should be doing with my free time, but it's my stress relief, and I need that pretty much every day. So it's completely worth it.

And that's all I got!!"

St. Patty's day was fun...i think lol! Me and Steph got pushed on stage at Floyd's...I can't really say I remember it. I think that's the most drunk I've been in forevvvvv. But it was a good time. Then the next day we had a BBQ for Nikki's b-day!

We saw V for Vendetta and it was sooo good. And that night made me realize how lucky I am to have a guy like Ryan. On the way home we were laughing so hard we couldn't breathe, thinking the exact same things at the same time (it was weird, trust me...and we do it all the time) and then later that night we laughed even harder while we attempted to give his english bulldog a bath lol.

Life is good...my friends are amazing. Even though I still hate my major, there's too many other good things to let that get me down!"

Today is a rainy day and I just want to sleep all day...but nope I won't be done for like 4 1/2 more hours :( Things with Ryan are completely amazing...I can't even put into words how great he is. I love him so much. We go to bed every night with every intention of falling asleep early but then we end up goofing off all night long. Like we always say...cheers to never breaking up.

"event","I have had a really bad first 2 weeks of school. I figured out that I probly want to change my major, but then I will lose my out of state waiver and the past 2 years of school would pretty much be a waste. It's stressing me out beyond belief. My laptop is completely broken and that's been most of my stress lately because no matter what I try it wont get fixed and I've been computerless for a while. My dad had me send my computer home which costed <b>75 dollars</b>!!! so he could look at it. Plus my dad already spent 20 bucks to get my installation cd here and that didn't even work. My professor is pissed at me, which is always fun. Butttt I also have great news. The cruise for spring break is officially booked!!! The cruise of drunken dreams will set sail on March 6th, but after we spend the weekend at Kali's condo in Daytona! Spring break is going to be completely amazing...everytime I think about it I get soooo excited. Another good thing is me and Ryan have been together for 3 months now, and I'm soo happy with him.

I guess I'll be really really late and talk about the orange bowl...it was sooo fun. We stayed on the beach, and had so much fun (besides all the pointless things we had to do lol). We had an adventure the first night where we went on the service elevator into the kitchen and stole stickers, then got in trouble with the guy at the front desk. It was hilarious. The next night we went to Mark Leitz's house for a party and that was full of drinking games (team erection set!) and girls nights 2006! 

AFter the orange bowl I stayed with Ryan in Weston for a couple nights. He showed me around town, watched the Rose Bowl, went on an airboat ride, went to the drive-in...it was lots of fun. And then school started. lol...but hopefully things will get better. It's rush week all this week, and next weekend I'm going to Orlando for FFA. But Josh is going, and we've become really good friends recently, so it should be fun.

I think that's enough updating for now!!"

"event","Last night was so crazy and so fun. I wasn't even really expecting to do anything, but then Andrew called me and told me to come to Perera's party. It was soooo fun. I was DD for the night, and actually made it more fun...I ended up driving Andru, Nathan, Rod, and Ryan to 711 so they could get coke and smokes and the funniest stuff happened. Ryan walked in on me in teh bathroom, my friends called Meghan and told her they want to do her, Nathan puked out the window...allll over my dad's car, and in the process, he lost his hat on 620, so we had to turn around and get it, go to a car wash where Nathan washed my car at 2 in the morning. We all had lots of really great serious drunken talks, and it was so much fun. I gave lots of girl advice to they guys. So fun. Until I called Ryan and he got mad...he kinda pulled a Linsey so of course I forgave him. That was not so fun. But I love that guy so much and I just wanna see him again!!!

That's about it...tonight should be another great night. I love my friends :)"

It's really nice to be home and see my family and friends. I've done a lot of hanging out with Andrew and Rod and that whole gang. When I saw Andru for the first time, his family had just gotten back from the Hollywood premier of The Ringer, cuz his sister Janna is in it. I was completely starstruck FOR them after seeing all those pictures...they hung out with Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore all night, and met so many other celebrities it's insane. So everyone go see the Ringer on Friday ok??

Tomorrow the grandparents are coming to town for dinner, and then I'm going out for Lindsey Jo's birthday! I can't wait to see everyone that I haven't seen in what...over a year?

I'm sure I'm leaving out lots of stuff. But that's about it for now :)"

I was so productive yesterday. Went to 2 flute recitals, finished my notebook that I had put off all semester, cleaned out my car, cleaned my room, went to target, and got a really sweet package from my mom..she gave all the rommies a $15 gift certificate for starbucks to study for exams. She is so sweet!! 

There has been way too much drama lately!! I think we need Christmas break so much.

Speaking of Christmas, our tree is freakin amazing. 

You know you eat at Taco Bell too much when you and your roommate both leave separately with our significant others to eat dinner, and both end up walking in to Taco Bell at the same time. Seriously now...

Alright so tomorrow is Theory final and my last lesson. Tuesday is sight singing. Wednesday at 7:30 AM (I'm gonna need like 3 different alarms for that one) is my history exam, then by 2:30 I have to turn in my final project for World Music Cultures...then I'm done!!!!! I think I might manage all A's again, as long as I work really hard these next few days. 

Other than all that...I still love the regz no matter what, my boyfriend is amazing, and I'm really sad that later this week will be my last time seeing my big sis for a long time!! :("

Highlighted my hair, got a pedicure, got acrylics, eating massive amounts of cookie dough, bought cute stuff for my room...this is what an off weekend will do to me. Its my first time having nails and I don't know what to do with myself. I locked my keys in my car today...with only my credit card with me. I had Meghan's number memorized, so I called her from the gas station, who then called Ashley, who then came up the gas station to save my life with my extra key.

Saw Harry Potter on thurs night...that pretty much left me exhausted yesterday but still went to Betty last night. We made a healthy snack of green beans in the middle of the night...mom would be proud. I would type more but my nails are bothering me! so this is all you get"

"event","So this morning Ryan and I are walking out of my house to his car...only to see that his windshield is completely smashed in, with what looks like a baseball bat. What kind of dick does that??? I felt so bad for him, especially since the reason he came over last night is because I passed out when I was supposed to go over there. So today I brought him some lunch since he was stuck in his house all day with no car. Last night he stayed up with me til like 4 in the morning cuz I was really upset about some things and it made me feel a lot better. When I have down time to think about things...it gets bad, cuz there's so much crap going on at home and in the past that I just don't want to think about anymore.

BUT on a happier note, we figured out our Thanksgiving plans!!! A mid afternoon Thanksgiving dinner at Osaka Japanese steakhouse, come home get into pajamas/stretchy clothing and get a Publix cheesecake, drink some nice girly wine, and watch all the Thanksgiving episodes of Friends. It's gonna be our new Thanksgiving tradition for whenever we're together for Thanksgiving :)

I played in a recital today...that went pretty well..I was nervous at first but it got better and I felt pretty good about it.

I'm getting so unmovitvated to go to class and it seems like I skip one class every day...

"event","This weekend was so much fun. My weekend pretty much started on Thursday, where Julian let a male prostitute, who had gotten himself into a ""situation"", into the house. His name was Otis and he was definitely on some drugs and really creepy, so Steph Marlena and I all went into Phil's room to hide until he left. All this time Otis is telling all of the boys how all girls want is sex and blah blah blah. They finally called him a taxi and he left. So later Phil gets a little baby frog from the backyard and throws it on Steph, causing Steph to throw her drink in the air and run off screaming. Phil decides to introduce the frog to Julian, who is trying to sleep at this point. But Julian hears all of us laughing so he opens his door, Phil decides to throw it in his room, but at the same time Julian sees something flying towards his door and slams it...right on the frog. Steph is still drunk and angry at the frog so she sprays it with shaving cream (we cant seem to stay away from that stuff) and then Phil puts it out of its misery by hitting it with the bottle. We named the frog Otis in memory of the male prostitute and made a facebook group as a tribute. 

Friday was candidate class night...I can't even count the stories. Affer spilled her drink on the floor, Case gets out red koolaid and mixes it, Jimmy eats it, Julian rolls around in it. Everyone changes into Kyle's clothes (or his dads!!). There was a huge orgy in the living room. There was a peeing party in the bathroom. There were many distractions with beer pong. We sat in the hallway for half an hour trying to get Kyle's door unlocked, while I was on the phone with Ryan sooooo upset that we couldn't get in. I bought Jimmy John's for myself and someone else and I never got to eat it. I had an outgoing call to my dad at 2am. Jimmy and Case try to get on the roof. I thought I woke up next to Steph and Marlena, but Marlena was actually Jimmy. The stories are endless and we spent all of the next day talking about them. I love my friends so much!!!!

We went to the mall yesterday....it was FAMU's homecoming....enough said. Then there were TBS events and it was a lot of fun being on the other side this time. I was stupid and wore flip flops though. We went to Taco bell afterwards and I was convinced I wasn't gonna go out last night because I was too tired and am starting to get sick. But nope...I still went, was pretty spacey and tired the whole entire time...picked up Steph from another party where she could barely keep herself standing up. We watched the video from Friday night and laughed sooooo hard. Then I came home and slept til 1:30 :)

I really have the best friends in the whole world, love it!"

-Bathroom parties where we throw everything in the bathroom into the sink saying ""you just gotta organize it!!"" quoting Julez.
-Jokes by Mark Shilling
-Meghan coming into my room chugging what little is left of our milk.
-Meghan telling me the next day that she woke up cuddling her Harry Potter book and with our bathroom trash can in her room.

LOVE IT

"event","Our good friend Harry came last night! Oh so much fun.

The best part about getting drunk is waking up in the morning and having everyone tell you what happened. And let's just say my toast to a drama free night did NOT work but I'm not gonna put all that here...

We made jello shots that ended up being rum with a hint of cherry. Cops came pretty early on...but I think I was too incoherent to know it. Apparently I'm the main reason the toilet seat is completely off our toilet! ha! It was already broken a little and I went to Ashley and was like ""look its broken!"" and she was like ""no its not..."" so I pushed it off and was like ""See!!! its broken!"". That was a surprise when I walked out of my room this morning.

Despite the drama, it was a very good night and I had a lot of fun!

BTW, I pretty much have the best roommates (oh wait im sorry...""rommies"") in the world! AND the best friends in the world. I keep on looking at my pictures and everytime I'm like wow...I don't know what I would do without them. Love it...

We are setting Meghan's turtles free soon and I'm gonna be sad. I grew fond of Bert and Ernie!

""Rooster I'm all alone!""

-This weekend was a lot of fun actually getting to hang out and watch the game with friends! We had so much fun jumping up and down and screaming whenever we would get ahead. So much fun!
-The bitchfest was a success and lots of fun :)
-Our candidate class shirts are cuuuute and they DONT look like miami colors!!!
-Los compadres is the greatest place ever
-My hair is very very blonde and I love it!
-I got my ears repierced! Thats all I need is more to spend money on.
-Ummm memorizing etudes is the worst thing ever invented and it makes me suck so much.
-Hurricane Rita is going to Texas and is already a category 5. Please pray for my family in Corpus and Houston. My mom told me that it could still be a hurricane by the time it gets to Austin. It sucks being away from your family when stuff like that might happen :\
-I went on a cleaning spree today and my room looks awesome. AND this weekend I will try and make it look cute. We'll see....
-Today at practice Meghan says ""Hey BJ's here"" and then I look over and he's over there with that special someone! Ughhhh then after practice he came up to me and after he left Affer was like ""you still like him"" and I was like yeah...and I started crying because it sucks so much that I have to like a guy that was so horrible to me and I can't get over it. It really really sucks.
-We are painting this weekend! We decided to go ahead and paint random things on our wall like ""beef sucks"" and pictures of turtles.
-And finally the most important event of this week....HARRY IS FRIDAY!!!! I'm so excited!!! Everyone's been talking about it so much it better not suck lol.

Pleeeeease Friday get here faster!"

I wish I could remember some things that happened...oh geez. It was Colin's first time to drink, which was funny. Apparently I made Jesse really mad and he started breaking stuff. I had fun though.

Today was gonna be my day to catch up on sleep...uh yeah that didn't happen. And I definitely wasted a whole day. 

This week of chiefs is gonna be easy!!! Yay for an off weekend finally. 

BITCHFEST 2005 THIS FRIDAY AT OUR HOUSE!!! It's gonna be fuuuuun. Everyone when they come in has to throw their phones away so there is no drama and we are gonna sit around drinkin girly drinks, bitching, and just be girls yessssss

"event","Alright so....first of all, my body pretty much hates me. Too much drinking and not enough sleep. But I did eat vegetables yesterday! :) I love my friends more than anything. I'm having the time of my life...but I really need to start thinking about my major more and less about partying. But it's still at the beginning of the semester and I'll tone it down I promise.

I'm doing piccolo for chiefs this year and I'm thinking maybe it was a bad idea because I swear I'm losing my hearing.

Helped make 500 ribbons for chiefs to wear tomorrow. That was fun.

Highlights from last night: Steph crying in the closet when the cops came, me pretending to be studying when the cops came, Meghan and her HOTT new friend Robb (and finding out that he wasn't so hott later on..), still not knowing how much I spent at McDonald's last night, Meghan's pajamas, and me saying ""Donde!"" wherever I went. 

Jesse showed up with ""I'm sorry I'm a douche"" flowers and waffles today.

My roommates are awesome and our house WILL look cute someday.

Tuesdays and Thursdays are going to suck SO MUCH this semester.

And finally, I am AWESOME at plunging toilets."

"event","Preseason training started today. Got 3 hours of sleep last night...I'm a genius. 

Speaking of geniuses...""Liquor after beer, never been sicker"" and ""Beer after liquor in the clear"" are only something a genius would say.

Hymn night was last night and it was AMAZING. I'm such a baby and pretty much started crying immediately. I just started thinkin about how I met all my best friends in the whole world in chiefs and how I was on the other side a year ago.

I have the best roommates ever and the best neighbors ever. Jesse was over last night and we hung out in Meghan's room til like 2:30 just goofing off. LOVE IT!

More chiefs tomorrow...at least we've got chiefs nappy time tomorrow.

And ummm this entry is pretty much worthless but that's ok! I'm exhausted!"

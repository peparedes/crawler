"event","I went out last night with work chicas and my friend Jeff, We had a blast.  Some awesome things that happened last night: Nicole skipping up front street singing to her friend Jason  ""I love meat, I love meat"" just to piss him off because he's a vegetarian.  Kristen walking along the rock street parking wall, Krazy gluing a wrestling figurines legs back on, getting hit on by a lesbian, Making grilled cheese drunk for everyone.  My crazy room mate Tom being a loud obnoxious drunk, eating all my food, Clayton telling me how he ate ice cream off some girls fingers because they never got silverware at the pancake house, and that they got $80 for bringing some old guys to their hotel.  That all happened after bar close, and I really can't remember anything before that, so this will have to do for now."

It will be entertaining. Come along &ndash; I think you are going to like it.&rdquo; The Met&rsquo;s 2014 Carmen is a welcome return for Richard Eyre&rsquo;s wonderful 2010 production. It was brooding and atmospheric and claustrophobic and doom-laden and I did quite like it. Though I think, re-watching the 2010 version (<a href=""http://metopera.org/ondemand"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"" target=""_blank"">Met Opera on Demand</a> makes this far too easy), that I prefer the earlier version, as it has more vivacity and less unrelieved gloom (though even the 2014 version perks up for the irrepressible and almost Gilbert-and-Sullivan-esque comic quintet in act two).</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">There are three main musical themes in the prologue to Carmen. First is the infectiously joyful &ldquo;March of the Toreadors&rdquo;, repeated once in act four, then there&rsquo;s what may be the best-known song in all opera, the &ldquo;Toreador Song&rdquo;, repeated once in act two (yes, <em>that</em> one, to the tune of &ldquo;Toreador, don&rsquo;t spit on the floor&rdquo;), and finally there&rsquo;s the ominous &ldquo;Fate Theme&rdquo;, which recurs six times in the next four acts. Legend (a.k.a. &ldquo;The Victrola Book of the Opera&rdquo;) has it that this last is a transcript of the only piece of Heavenly music that Satan remembered after being cast out of Heaven, though absent a definitive explanation of how Bizet came by this strange intelligence, I&rsquo;m not sure that legend gets away with it. But by sheer weight of numbers, doom-laden-ness is bound to be play an important role.</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">People who protest that this isn&rsquo;t what they would mean by &ldquo;vivacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; could recall that the Icelanders who got that far west called the frozen place they got to &ldquo;Greenland&rdquo; to make it sound more attractive to the people back home: Bizet may be being disingenous. Except that the first two themes of the prologue really <em>are</em> foot-stampingly cheerful. There&rsquo;s a balance here, and it feels like the 2014 version, while brilliant and provoking and I&rsquo;m very glad I saw it, is a useful example of what happens when you push down too far on one side. &nbsp;(Which is not to say that the sets and the costumes and the music and the dancing were not wonderful, because they absolutely were.)</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Aleksandrs Antonenko&rsquo;s Don Jos&eacute; (2014) reminded me of Colin Firth&rsquo;s Mr Darcy: there&rsquo;s a facial similarity, but also, from the moment Carmen appears, Antonenko is transfixed by her, staring at her from the other side of the stage. At the same point in the 2010 version, Roberto Alagna&rsquo;s Don Jos&eacute; has his back to her, cheerfully rolling a cigarette, unconcerned. Yes, when she starts singing at him directly he turns to her for a moment, and then he just smiles and turns away again. And yes, he&rsquo;s reeled in shortly after that, but it wasn&rsquo;t doomed from the very first moment. The original text (in a bit left out in both cases) has Don Jos&eacute; excuse himself to Zuniga just before the cigarette girls appear, saying he needs to make a chain for his firing-pin, and he is still doing that when Carmen comes up to him: she has to ask him what he&rsquo;s doing to get his attention. And then she throws the flower. And then he has three lines for the impression that has just been made, the first of which is dismissive. I&rsquo;d really like to see that version some day, though it might be less palatable that a star tenor is ignoring the action for one of the most famous scenes of the opera. (Having said that, the Met Player also has a version from 1997 with Waltraud Meier and Pl&aacute;cido Domingo, which comes much closer, with Domingo ignoring Carmen through much of the song, sitting with his back to her working on the priming-pin, and it works really really well.)</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">[And to digress into Doctor Who for a moment, in square brackets for those who would rather not, one of the reasons I want that missing scene-ette is for the utter &ldquo;Dark Water&rdquo; (8.11) parallel:</p>

<strong>Carmen</strong>: Ton &eacute;pinglette, vraiment! &nbsp;Ton &eacute;pinglette&hellip; &eacute;pinglier de mon &acirc;me&hellip; [Your priming-pin, really?! &nbsp;Your priming pin. &nbsp;&hellip; [one assumes, wonderingly:] Pin-maker of my soul&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p style=""margin: 0px;""><strong>Doctor</strong>: [wonderingly:] Two hearts&hellip;
<strong>Missy</strong>: And both of them yours.</p></blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">One could argue that Carmen has nothing to do with Doctor Who, but given that in the very first appearance of Clara in &ldquo;Asylum of the Daleks&rdquo; (7.1), the music that she is playing is from this scene of this opera, the converse is clearly not true.]</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">So. &nbsp;Doomed from the very first moment? &nbsp;Certainly one way of playing it. &nbsp;Not for nothing does Hugh Macdonald say &ldquo;French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen&rdquo;. &nbsp;And it is a fitting touch that Carmen and Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s only moments of happiness, between running away to be free in the mountains with the smugglers at the end of act two and being on the outs together in the mountains at the beginning of act three, are portrayed not by the singers themselves but by two ballet dancers over the beautiful music of the entr&rsquo;acte. &nbsp;And their motions and the music are much more free in these moments than the dancers dancing much more constrictedly over the &ldquo;Fate Theme&rdquo; in the prologue, or that the female dancer wears black for the &ldquo;Fate Theme&rdquo; and white for the freer and lovelier entr&rsquo;acte. &nbsp;(That costume change, and whether it represents an actual change in Carmen&rsquo;s being or just in Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s perception of her, is worth a thesis on its own.)</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">And yes, the children&rsquo;s chorus at the changing of the guard in act one and the crowd waiting for the march of the toreadors in act four remind us that not everyone is unhappy or doomed. &nbsp;But it feels as though the two leads are too single-mindedly gloomy. &nbsp;It also feels odd that when they&rsquo;ve been single-mindedly doom-eager all the way through, and Carmen reads her and Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s deaths in the cards over and over in act three, Carmen can effortlessly leave and be a completely different person in act four. &nbsp;Yes, this is prepared for by </p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); padding-left: 20px;"">
<p style=""margin: 0px;""><strong>Carmen</strong>: l&rsquo;amour est loin, tu peux l&rsquo;attendre;

You stop waiting, and then it&rsquo;s there!
All around you, quickly, quickly,
It comes, goes away, comes back again &ndash;

You think you can avoid it, it holds you fast.]</p></blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">But&hellip; Ah. &nbsp;You wonder what Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s paired replying song would have been towards the end of act three, when he has instead the single line &ldquo;prends garde &agrave; toi, Carmen&rdquo;, reprising the warning refrain of Carmen&rsquo;s famous love (?) song from act one. &nbsp;It is almost as though in this version it isn&rsquo;t Carmen that trapped Jos&eacute; (though aside from the Mr Darcy stare in act one, that is what seemed to happen), but Jos&eacute; that somehow trapped Carmen. &nbsp;Which would explain Escamillo&rsquo;s polite but failing attempts to reason with Jos&eacute; in act three (also cut here is the first half of the knife fight where Escamillo is much better than Jos&eacute; but only defending himself, and when Jos&eacute; complains that he isn&rsquo;t trying, Escamillo agrees that he isn&rsquo;t, explaining that it&rsquo;s his job to kill bulls, not people, and he really doesn&rsquo;t want to kill him), and Carmen&rsquo;s attempt to escape and create a new life in act four, at the end of which, unfortunately for all concerned, Jos&eacute; catches up with her.</p><p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">So. &nbsp;Brilliantly performed? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Psychologically astute? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Deeply troubling? Yes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Entertaining&rdquo;? &nbsp;&hellip; Well, definitely the first three!</p></div>

"event","<p>Yes, there are spoilers. Lots of them.</p>
<p>I have no idea how someone new to the program would react to this one, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nods to everything from the Second Doctor stories <em>Tomb of the Cybermen</em> and <em>The Invasion</em> (which apparently gets an even more tangible link next week, when Kate Lethbridge-Stewart throws the head of one of the Invasion-era Cybermen at the feet of the new ones), to the setup of a standard Third Doctor vs the Master allied with alien invaders of Earth story, to the Cloister Bell as the first TARDIS key hits the lava (first heard in the Fourth Doctor&rsquo;s <em>Logopolis</em>), to the introduction of Kamelion in the Fifth Doctor&rsquo;s <em>King&rsquo;s Demons</em> (though that involved an android briefly impersonating the Master, and not the other way around), to the young Chang who was suborned by the Master in the Eighth Doctor&rsquo;s TV movie (&ldquo;Doctor Chang!&rdquo;), possibly to <em>The Eleventh Hour</em> (Missy walking through the 3W hologram as the Doctor walked through the Atraxi one), to <em>Day of the Doctor</em> (The Doctor: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very&hellip; uh&hellip; realistic.&rdquo; Clara: &ldquo;Tongues?&rdquo; The Doctor: &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; / Eleven: &ldquo;venom sacs in the tongue?&rdquo; Ten: &ldquo;yeah, I&rsquo;m getting the point, thank you.&rdquo;), and to <em>Time of the Doctor</em>&nbsp;with Clara&rsquo;s disagreement with something in another universe about what the important question is, not to mention multiple callbacks to episodes from this season. Then there are musical motifs: the Doctor saying &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m missing&hellip; something&hellip; obvious&rdquo;, cue ominous music, but not just any ominous music, that&rsquo;s the Cyberman theme from series two. And a cheeky nod to Capaldi&rsquo;s best-known previous role as the very sweary Malcolm Tucker (Doctor Chang, examining the psychic paper: &ldquo;Why is there all this swearing?&rdquo; / The Doctor, taking it back: &ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of&hellip; internalized anger.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>And, with a female Master onscreen, a future female Doctor becomes canonical (the possibility was already allowed for by a line in the Neil Gaiman story from series six), answering a question which has been in the air ever since Tom Baker was asked thirty-five years ago if he thought his successor could be a woman, to which he mischievously replied &ldquo;Oh, what a good idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to <em>Dark Water</em>. First off, it&rsquo;s a Moffat two-parter, so it is very unlikely that it will stay in the Third Doctor and UNIT vs Master allied with aliens invading the earth, cue likely falling-out between aliens and Mistress and possible alliance between Mistress and Doctor to contain the threat. (Hmm. Aside from UNIT, how very <em>End of Time</em>.) As Amy said towards the beginning of <em>The Big Bang</em>, which turned the already-complicated <em>Pandorica Opens</em> on its head, it will probably get more complicated than that. No idea how, but looking forward to finding out.</p>
<p>One more prediction: in the last moments of this episode, Danny sees the reflection of the civilian boy he killed as he is considering deleting his humanity (and, unknown to him, being re-downloaded into a Cyberman). Given his strong sense of responsibility for the children in <em>In the Forest of the Night</em>, I expect this will cause him to decide not to delete his humanity, but to work with the boy, to find out where they really are and what they can do about it. Though if Danny&rsquo;s dead body already has a Cyberman exoskeleton around it, and besides which is dead, and the Doctor has stated that they can&rsquo;t use the TARDIS to fix that (and yes, I know, the Doctor lies, but&hellip;), I&rsquo;m not sure what can be done. Though there&rsquo;s also the question of what happens to Orson Pink in that case.</p>
<p>The episode itself? Felt really really good. No, there&rsquo;s no scientific reason why Cybermen would still need organic components (the skeletons) or downloaded organic minds (with icky emotions removed), but they&rsquo;re here as pure horror, not hard science fiction. Or we&rsquo;re back to the idea that they aren&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t see themselves as robots, but as upgrades of living things. And apparently on a voluntary basis this time. &ldquo;We are the Cybermen and we are here to help&rdquo;?? Although the way Danny is emotionally sucker-punched by being exposed to the parts of his life most likely to cause him to willingly agree to delete his emotions suggests either that the not-emotionless Missy or Seb gave them some pointers on how to improve their &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; success rate, or they&rsquo;ve been running A/B tests for so long on how to get the most voluntary conversions (since they really believe it&rsquo;s for the good of the recipients) that they&rsquo;ve come up with a strategy so effective that it looks like emotional insight.</p>
<p>Clara&rsquo;s post-its as she prepared to answer Danny&rsquo;s question from last week and tell him the truth, and then started with the most important thing, which was nothing to do with the adventures? And then killing Danny in the cold open? And Clara&rsquo;s response? &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t terrible: it was boring. &hellip; He was alive, and then he was dead, and it was nothing.&rdquo; / &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve anything. Nobody deserves&hellip; anything.&rdquo; [&ldquo;Od&rsquo;s bodykins, man, much better: use every man / after his desert, and who should &rsquo;scape whipping?&rdquo; &ndash; <em>Hamlet</em> II.ii] &ldquo;But I am owed&hellip; better.&rdquo; Still bitterness from <em>Kill the Moon</em> in that last phrase? Entirely possibly. And then the seven keys to doomsday (sorry, to the TARDIS, though the number of keys is probably a reference to <em>Seven Keys to Doomsday</em>, a Doctor Who stage play in 1974, re-released as a Big Finish audio in 2008), one of them hidden in Audrey Niffenegger&rsquo;s <em>The Time Traveller&rsquo;s Wife</em> (which could be subtitled the story of the Doctor and River Song), and then the volcano scene which acknowledges that sometimes time can be rewritten and sometimes it can&rsquo;t, and it takes a Time Head to tell which is which, and even if it can it takes precision and great care. And the whole scene calling back to Journey Blue in <em>Into the Dalek</em> trying to threaten the Doctor at gunpoint to taking her back to her ship, and him outfacing her until she says please. Or the <em>Deep Breath</em> interrogation scene with its discussion of options and fallbacks. &ldquo;Paradox loop&rdquo;, as the Doctor desperately tries to get Clara to understand, knowing that River would understand instinctively, and perhaps forgetting that in <em>The Wedding of River Song</em> River did know but since it was someone she loved dying she decided she didn&rsquo;t give a damn about the rules either. And then &ldquo;Do as you&rsquo;re told&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;re back to the fraught conversation near the end of <em>Listen</em>, except this time it ends differently. And then she throws the last key and&hellip; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;d do it again.&rdquo;&hellip; The acting from both Coleman and Capaldi in this scene is superb. (And never mind that the Doctor can open the TARDIS by snapping his fingers, and for that matter so can Clara. That&rsquo;s not the emotional point of this scene.) And it just keeps going. &ldquo;I love him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re quite the mess of chemicals, aren&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; Capaldi&rsquo;s slight frown after Coleman says &ldquo;Absolutely fair enough&rdquo;, before explaining what he actually meant, leading up to the transcendently wonderful &ldquo;Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?&rdquo; And then the Doctor&rsquo;s wholly alien response to Clara&rsquo;s entirely human reaction? I mean, yes, probably also true that &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got work to do&rdquo; is a reference to the Seventh Doctor story <em>Survival</em>, but that scarcely seems to matter. These may be my favourite scenes from the whole fifty-one-year history.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re back to Danny in the Nethersphere, and Chris Addison being delightfully camp as the Nethersphere administrator Seb. &ldquo;There are some forms to fill in. It might help you relax. Well, it won&rsquo;t, but we do need them filled in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Twelve continues his strange mix of not understanding humans at all, and suddenly seeming to understand them better than they do themselves, berating Clara for her appearance and attitude until she bursts out &ldquo;Are you forgetting why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; and he retorts &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. So buck up, and give me some attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Michelle Gomez as Missy turns up, and that&rsquo;s a totally brilliant scene too. &ldquo;My heart is maintained by the Doctor&rdquo;, indeed. &ldquo;You can probably take your hand down now, Doctor.&rdquo; And then we get the Doctor being as protective as a can-opener [<em>Gaudy Night</em>]: &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; (Clara holds out her hand) &ldquo;No.&rdquo; (The Doctor takes her hand) &ldquo;Good. There would be something very wrong if you were.&rdquo; (And the skulls turn their heads to watch them as they go, recalling the crypt in <em>The Wedding of River Song</em>, but working so well it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.)</p>
<p>And then Danny gets the call from someone on the other side called Clara Oswald. (And at the same time Doctor Chang says &ldquo;I promise you, this is not the con,&rdquo; which leads to the question what would he admit was the con, which we&rsquo;ll presumably get to next episode.) In <em>Time of the Doctor</em>, all of Gallifrey was behind the crack in the skin of the universe, and was asking the question &ldquo;Doctor Who?&rdquo;, a question which only the Doctor knew the answer to, and so if he gave that answer, they would know it was safe for them to come back. Near the end of that episode, Clara spoke through the crack and told them they were asking the wrong question, that his name was the Doctor, and that if they loved him, and they should, they would help him. Back to <em>Dark Water</em>, Clara is talking with Danny, and after the Doctor primes her again to be skeptical, wants him to answer questions that only Danny would know the answer to, so she can come and get him. He, since he knows that he&rsquo;s dead and she isn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be, refuses to give her the answer she is asking for, saying only that he loves her. Which is so sublimely in character for Danny (and such a callback to the sequence in <em>Time of the Doctor</em> and to two earlier conversations this episode) that though Clara appears not to realize it at first and breaks off the call, the penny may have dropped as she backed her chair away, and certainly will sometime before the end of next episode.</p>
<p>But Clara is distracted by the revealed Cyberman of Dr Skarosa, and let&rsquo;s pause there a moment, because Missy making her pet scientist stooge take a name clearly based on the Dalek homeworld of Skaro feels like such an obvious clue to the Doctor (if he were paying attention) that it reawakens the long fan-held suspicion that all of the Master&rsquo;s plans are so ridiculously flawed that they have to be more about attracting the Doctor&rsquo;s attention than actually taking over the world. Which makes sense of Missy&rsquo;s delivery of the &ldquo;my boyfriend&hellip; because he loves me so&rdquo; lines from <em>Deep Breath</em>, which seemed a bit off if it were something she actually believed, but if it&rsquo;s something that she has wished so long were true but knows on some level is not, her delivery is brilliant and makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re back outside to the reveal of who Missy actually is (the looks on both of their faces worth pages of dialogue) and the Cybermen walking down the steps of St Paul&rsquo;s, and through the eye of one of the Cybermen (top-notch direction from Rachel Talalay throughout, and also a likely shout-out to <em>The Time of Angels</em> and the eyes being not the windows of the soul but the doors) we&rsquo;re back to the Nethersphere and Danny hesitating over the delete button and turning the reflection of the iPad to reveal that the boy he shot is standing behind him, and the boy starts to speak&hellip; cue closing credits.</p>
<p>Damn near perfect. There&rsquo;s three words for it.</p>"

<hr>

Foeda est in coitu et brevis voluptas
et taedet Veneris statim peractae.
non ergo ut pecudes libidinosae
caeci protinus irruamus illuc
(nam languescit amor peritque flamma);
sed sic sic sine fine feriati
et tecum iaceamus osculantes.
hic nullus labor est ruborque nullus:
hoc iuvit, iuvat et diu iuvabit;
hoc non deficit incipitque semper.
-- attr. Petronius Arbiter

<hr>

Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short;
And done, we straight repent us of the sport:
Let us not rush blindly on unto it,
Like lustful beasts, that only know to do it:
For lust will languish, and that heat decay,
But thus, thus, keeping endless Holy-day,
Let us together closely lie, and kiss,
There is no labour, nor no shame in this;
This hath pleased, doth please and long will please; never
Can this decay, but is beginning ever.
-- Ben Jonson

<hr>

Delight of lust is gross and brief
And weariness treads on desire.
Not beasts are we, to rush on it,
Love sickens there, and dies the fire.
But in eternal holiday, 
Thus, thus, lie still and kiss the hours away.
No weariness is here, no shamefastness,
Here is, was, shall be, all delightsomeness.
And here no end shall be,
But a beginning everlastingly.
-- Helen Waddell

No clever turn for the sestet: I just wanted to see the three of them together.  This may be why I tend to stay off LJ for long periods of time: it's too easy to get lost in all the interesting stuff in here."

And I must admit that in this case, when I violently agreed with the arguments being made, and shared the dismay at some of the statements from the other side, it seemed perfectly reasonable for her to say (against the disbelief that one person could have written 37 plays, where nobody contests that Vega wrote some 1500 to 2500) ""Lope de Fucking Vega, bitches"".

"event","From <i>Gaudy Night</i>, chapter one, Ph&oelig;be and Harriet:

<blockquote>""...He's writing a paper that contradicts all of Lambard's conclusions, and I'm helping by toning down his adjectives and putting in deprecatory footnotes.  I mean. Lambard may be a perverse old idiot, but it's more dignified not to say so in so many words.  A bland and deadly courtesy is more devastating, don't you think?""

""Infinitely.""
</blockquote>

I'm reading Douglas Hofstadter's <i>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language</i> and having trouble getting into it, which puzzles me because both the subject matter and the conceit (88 translations of a French poem from 1537, wound round with Hofstadterian essays, and yes, the echo of <i>iumonna gold galdre bewunden</i> was deliberate) sound absolutely my kind of thing.

Still trying to understand that, though the book has already paid for itself by prompting me to get hold of Vikram Seth's <i>The Golden Gate</i>, which is quite probably the best book I've read this year.  

But Hofstadter is currently lambasting an article by John Searle, and yes, it looks like Searle's article is intellectually dishonest, but the hyperbolic invective creeping into Hofstadter's tone is off-putting.  You can hear the tone of incredulous disbelief in his words, and it distracts -- and suddenly I understand that quip in <i>Gaudy Night</i> about a bland and deadly courtesy being more devastating.  Hofstadter isn't weakening the truth of his argument, but he is weakening <i>the impact</i> of his argument by descending into the lists and taking a swing.  He may have felt goaded into it, but it's a danger.  Like some parts of Richard Dawkins's <i>The God Delusion</i>: I may agree absolutely with the point that he's making, but his tone makes me feel awkwardly that there must have been a way of expressing it which wouldn't alienate part of the audience."

"event","So I was wearing my old college scarf yesterday, not for any snobbish reasons but because it's the warmest scarf I have and it has been cold.  And someone came up to me and asked ""Is that a Darwin scarf?""  First time anything like that has happened in Toronto.  And I admitted it wasn't, with that slight apology that Trinity people sometimes feel we owe for our extreme insularity, and it had been so long (my grade 12 Latin teacher gave me the scarf when he heard I was going up to Cambridge, and that was 18 years ago) that for a few moments I didn't even remember whether we had a Darwin College.

But of course we did; and it was in the gardens there that I did Theseus from Midsummer Night's Dream at the end of my first undergraduate year -- they had said they wanted a dead-serious Theseus, who might sound as though he was reading the FT while doing the ""More strange than true"" speech, and I thought ""Sure, I can do that"".  And where the fireworks from a neighbouring May Ball seriously disrupted our stroll and dialogue in IV.i and then completely failed to come in on cue when I wanted them for the throwaway line ""Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns"".  

You know, for all the complaining I may do from time to time, it has been an interesting old life, and no mistake.

And, because after that I was curious to see what a Darwin scarf looked like, here's the <a href=""http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Misc/Colours/index.html"">list</a>."

"event","Or, why am I still reading this awful book?<br /><br />

Well, it's an interesting idea, that there weren't actually widescale Anglo-Saxon invasions, that it was mostly acculturation.&nbsp; And one I would once have been professionally very interested in.&nbsp; And the idea may be valid even if his expression of it is off.&nbsp; But I wish I could find a better and more scholarly expression of it, because when he comes out with something like ""Being human, we like to personify such things, so we conjure up Arthur on one side and the likes of Alfred, Hengist and Horsa on the other."" my blood pressure does something unfortunate.&nbsp; And maybe he only means only that there were characters like Alfred on the Saxon side, and isn't borrowing Alfred from his place in real history (king of the West Saxons from 871-99, and of the ""Anglo-Saxons"" from perhaps 886, and incidentally the English defender of Britain against the invading Vikings) and thrusting him back into a different and mythical conflict four centuries earlier on the opposite side, but it leaves me greatly vexed.&nbsp; And rather unwilling to take his word for anything else, which would be unfortunate if there are bits of the book that are scholarly and accurate.<br /><br />

I was re-reading Tom Stoppard's <i>The Real Thing</i> the other day, and Henry has the wonderful speech when he's comparing real writing with a cricket bat, which -- even if it may look like a club -- is actually several pieces of wood cunningly put together in a certain way so that it's sprung, like a dance floor.&nbsp; Real writing is like that.&nbsp; Then you can hit a ball with barely any effort and it will go sailing out of the grounds.&nbsp; If you had used a club instead, the ball would only have travelled a few feet and you'd end up dropping the club and jumping around with your hands in your armpits.&nbsp; This book is a club in its recording of facts, even if its prose style is rather good.&nbsp; (""Consult any list of Roman emperors and it makes the English medieval monarchy, even during the Wars of the Roses, look remarkably stable."" It's a very good line.&nbsp; It may even be true, but there's no way I'm prepared to take his word for it at this point: he has completely blotted his copybook.)<br /><br />

(Okay, it's not as bad as the book I read years ago in which Merlin arranged for Beowulf to be killed by a flamethrower.&nbsp; But that was at least supposed to be fiction.) <br /><br />

<b>ETA</b>: So if this man, writing in 2004, shows up how easy it is to disprove Myres again, given that Myres was already quite discredited when I went up to Cambridge in 1989, I shall graduate from being vexed to being filled with rage.  I am absolutely prepared to believe the basic case -- that archaeological evidence doesn't support the idea of largescale Anglo-Saxon invasions -- but this particular exposition of it is doing its cause more harm than good.  Open question (mainly directed as <lj user=""sollersuk"">): is there a more scholarly exposition of this theory published somewhere else?"

And from the <a href=""http://www.bookslut.com/blog"">bookslut blog</a> I discovered that the British Library has put a facsimile of part of the Lindisfarne Gospels (among other <a href=""http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html"">famous books</a>) online.  Complete with magnifier, so if you want to examine the little Old English glosses you can knock yourself out.

I wonder where one could vote to have the Beowulf manuscript made available next, or if the CD facsimile that Kiernan did a while back means that's off the cards?"

"event","For years I have thought of Richard Dawkins as (among other things) an English version of Carl Sagan, and a voice sorely needed after Sagan's death in 1996.  And it was heartening after reading Dawkins's latest book, <i>The God Delusion</i>, to go to the <a href=""http://www.richarddawkins.net"">website</a> and hear him say ""Promoting science as poetry was one of the things that Carl Sagan did so well, and I aspire to continue his tradition"".

A compacted version of the incidents of the same story (he originally wanted to perform a reading of the original, but realizing it would take 40 hours, started to make interventions), told from a variety of first-person viewpoints.  Most notably, Baricco completely removes the gods (from material influence in the story, if not from the belief of the characters), and it is fascinating (as he notes in his preface) how Homer provides enough human agency that things might have turned out as they did even without the divine.  

A wonderful take on an old story, followed by a meditation on war, on the seductive beauty of war, which a people hungry for peace cannot simply deny or ignore if they hope to defeat it: the trick, not yet achieved, is to provide a more compelling beauty as an alternative.  

Thought-provoking, and very highly recommended."

"event","So one of the things that suggests to me that I might really be a software developer after all, and not simply a writer <i>manqu&eacute</i> (though I am him, too), is that after reluctantly discarding the idea of dropping my insomniac vision of a three-dimensional laser scanner on Hengest (hey, if Rowenna can remember forward 150 years to 597, and no that won't make the final draft but I know it's there, why shouldn't Hengest be able to remember forward 1549 years to present-day laser technology?), and thinking some more about the future genealogy of the characters (Rowenna's forward leap to her great-N-grandson in 597 was a very early part of the story, and based on what happened later, it would be tricky for &AElig;thelberht of Kent to be her great-N-grandson after all.  But I could make it happen, if &OElig;ric [Iurmanric's father and &AElig;thelberht's grandfather, in Frankia in 540] were not descended from Hengest and Horsa/Ash but from Hengest and Hretha, Eadwynn and Emrys), my mind switches to some software that draws hyperlinkable family trees.  And from thinking I'd have to write the whole thing myself, I realized that there must already be an xml schema for genealogical stuff (<a href=""http://xml.coverpages.org/genealogy.html"">yep</a>), though there might need to be additions to get the different colours for different houses (remember, in the new version, Hengest is a Jute, Horsa/Ash a Danish foster-son [hmm, do you suppose the xml schema understands foster-children?  Or that there is an agreed way of displaying them?], and Hretha possibly a Saxon, to say nothing of the interlinkings between the Germans and the Britons), and one suspects it could be xslted to a text format that could be plotted in <a href=""http://www.graphviz.org/"">GraphViz</a>.  Then all I need is something to build an imagemap so that the individual nodes can be hyperlinked to text files or database entries..."

"event","Saw the lilac festival in Rochester in Highland Park.  Perhaps the lilacs were a bit past their best, but they were still lovely, and other flowers and trees and blossoms were splendid.  Some of the lilacs had tags describing not only their species but giving a person's name and dates and details like a memorial tablet, and this reminded me of the Grantchester walk from Cambridge, along which there were two stone tablets set under trees.  The first (as one walked from Cambridge) stated:

<blockquote>In memory of 
TOM SANCHA
1947-1992
Courageous gifted and loved</blockquote>


And the second, larger and more elaborate:


<blockquote>These trees, in memory of
Isabella Hamson
the beautiful Miss Drummond
were planted in 1978
by her husband </blockquote>


I know no more of Tom or Isabella, but as I read their stones probably many dozens of times when I lived and walked there I wanted to remember them again here.

Reminds me though that one of the things I had wanted to do before I left Cambridge was fund a memorial plaque on a bench in the <a href=""http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/index.html"">Botanic Gardens</a>."

"event","<a href=""http://www.jroller.com/page/kdonald"">Keith Donald</a> spoke on how the Spring project deals with managing its own huge codebase and dependency complexities.  In the future, they will be breaking the project up into separate dedicated projects (as spring-webflow is already separate, there will be spring-core, spring-aop, etc), with a separate project that contains common build targets (<a href=""http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/springframework/spring-projects/common-build/"">CVS for common-build</a>).  This contains various files with grouped ant tasks (common-targets.xml, db-targets.xml, hibernate-targets.xml), and whichever ones are needed can be imported into project-specific build.xml files.  The build.xml for spring-webflow, for instance, is currently only 13 lines long: properties for the project title, project package, various property files and various imported common-build files.  

Their use of <a href=""http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy"">Ivy</a> to manage versioned third-party dependencies is also impressive.  I'd seen positive buzz in <a href=""http://blog.exis.com/colin/archives/2005/04/29/decision-to-use-ivy-is-a-no-brainer/"">Colin Sampaleanu's blog</a> and the springframework-developer list, but the demo of the management of transitive dependencies was really neat.

Keith Donald also spoke about Spring Web Flow, which had had Tapestry support on its road map a while back.  This has dropped off the immediate radar, but he is aware of two companies that have produced their own Tapestry implementations, though these remain closed-source."

The keynote included a demonstration of Spring Web Flow (nearly at 1.0 RC1), a framework for encoding the behaviour of business transactions across multiple web pages.  And I was lost in the elegance and power and wonder of it when someone nearby in the audience mentioned that they prefer the Tapestry model and find it is even more compact.  Now I was last experimenting with Tapestry round about July, just before Tapestry-4 went from alpha to beta, and even with a <a href=""http://www.agileskills2.org/EWDT/"">reference</a> that's a hell of a lot of light reading before tomorrow's SWF sessions if I am to be able to judge them accurately.

"event","Today I looked back for the first time in a long while at the old tale of Vortigern and Rowenna.  And was fired by the old dismay because it's not just Vortigern and Rowenna, but Vortigern and Tegau and Ceredig (Tegau's father) and Hengest and Liudbert and Hreowynn (Rowenna) and Horsa and Hreda and Vortimer and Catigirn (and the other two sons who as yet have no place in the story) and Emrys and Eadwynn and a reasonably detailed and historically carefully-crafted-though-entirely-fictitious chronology from 438 to 496.  Which is all very well, as someone says in Monty Python somewhere, but this is an off-licence, not a multi-generational family saga that makes <i>War and Peace</i> look like a walk in the park.

And the author's historical note threatens to be ridiculously long, because I think it's rather neat that Liudbert's plan delays the first two Kentish battles from (the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>'s) 455 and 456 to 460 and 461.  The man was battling against History, after all, he did well to make the impact that he did.  And then in the next generation Emrys and Eadwynn almost look as though they might make it work a second time.  No question but that I could make a mosaic of all the moments in that history that I see perfectly clearly, but a single narrative with a single protagonist is not emerging clearly out of the tangled threads.  (The glancing reference to Old Norse <i>&thorn;&aelig;ttr</i>, which means either ""thread"" or ""short story"", was entirely deliberate.)  Okay, Liudbert is in some ways the hero of the piece and everybody was in the same place from 449, so the earlier British bits could be back-storied somehow, but Liudbert seems to vanish after his pivotal role in the events of 463.  And given that by that time one or both sides didn't trust him, I had assumed his position became untenable and he left.  (And yes, I know ""449"" is a simplification of an off-by-one error of a made-up date -- see my anglo-saxons.net for the properly historical version of all this.  But there's no story in that, which is what I've long wanted to correct.)  

But nonetheless I mark this day with a writer's stone, for the Songs of the Saxon Shore (even if I can't figure out how to break them up) are back on my agenda."

<blockquote>
""The Buddha once gave a discourse to his disciples on how to live a life free of conflicts and problems.  He said that before we utter anything we first should know that what we're about to say is 'true, correct, and beneficial'."" (p. 124)
</blockquote>

Now true and correct have never been an issue -- though not at the stage of the character from the Mikado whose ""taste exact for faultless fact amounts to a disease"", I have long been heading in that direction.  But it had never occurred to me to put ""beneficial"" on a par with the other two.  And it makes a world of difference."

"event","Saw <i>Yes</i> this afternoon.  It was superb.  A love affair between an English-Irish-American woman and a man from Beirut, in about a hundred minutes, and in rhyming verse throughout.  And while there is a scene of walking through a garden with overhanging trees rich in blossom, don't be deceived by the verse into presupposing it is flowery or unrealistic: it is a thoroughly modern (and indeed post-9/11), sometimes gritty, sometimes painful collision as well.  It's brilliant.  The verse ends up being unimportant, rather than a too-present gimmick.  (Inevitable echo of Tante Marthe from <i>The Fashion in Shrouds</i>: ""Gold is so <i>comforting</i>, my dears, if you can really make it unimportant."")  May have more comments after seeing it again, but, basically, wow.  Well worth a look."

"event","So after reading OotP several months after everybody else and not liking it very much (though the gift was a thoughtful one, thanks <lj user=""zsazsa101"">!), I was in no great rush to get HBP.  But mostly because of a fugitive thought that Draco is rather like what the Viscount St George might have been with a different family, I did get it and have read it.  I enjoyed it much more than its predecessor.  

Indeed, Dumbledore's comment to Harry about how even among best friends one tends to think that one's own contribution is much more important than anything anyone else might say ranks as one of the more apposite things I've read in a while, and will probably survive independent of my rather sketchy memory of the rest of the books -- and off the top of my head, the only other thing that does that is Hermione's ""more important things"" speech from book one.  

And between the threads from <lj user=""ajhalluk"">'s indignation at JKR's rewriting of British political history by sloppy use of pronouns (or perhaps we're back in JKR's alternate maths again), and the drabble on <lj user=""yes_minister""> suggesting that it's actually AU, and the PM is neither Major nor Blair but Jim Hacker, the commentary is quite good fun too.  Sir Humphrey Appleby having to choose between being Cabinet Secretary and Head of Slytherin...  ""Yes"", as Sir Humphrey himself said after a pause in slightly similar circumstances, ""it is possible, isn't it?"""

"event","I have enjoyed <lj user=""matociquala"" />'s posts about writing for a long while now: <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/matociquala/548314.html"">here</a>'s a particularly interesting one.  Firstly because anybody quoting <a href=""http://abu.cnam.fr/cgi-bin/donner_html?cyrano1"">Cyrano</a>, from <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/trudeau-pierre-know.html"">Pierre Trudeau</a> on, will always get my full attention.  But I've heard the same levels discussed in the context of writing good code and learning to write better code.  In fact, the four levels of competence seem to be a general truism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscious_competence"">wikipedia article</a>.  But it drives the point home more strongly to have a well-worked example in a second field I have some first-hand experience with.  

So how do we best provoke the movement from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence to conscious competence to unconscious competence?  I mean, we all know that <a href=""http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html"">it takes ten years</a> to learn to write good code, but as <lj user=""matociquala"" /> points out, spending the ten years is not enough, you need to invest the ten years in an environment which forces you to grow.  Let's assume we've got the deep desire to improve, without which it doesn't matter how many years we spend, are there things that we can change in our day-to-day working environment to make us better?"

I was surprisingly underwhelmed by the exhibition, though in retrospect it's obvious that they'd put the best bits in the publicity posters.

"event","So the English have an expression, ""a swift half"", which means going to the pub and having a half pint of a drink and then getting on with whatever it was they were up to with very little time lost.  Right now, after losing most of the day to financial administrivia such that my real working day -- interrupted at 10am -- starts now and continues until I get done, I could really do with a swift half.  All I need is an English pub just across the common.  That's where the whole system breaks down -- while there are some quite good locals nearby, none of them are sufficiently local to meet the present emergency.

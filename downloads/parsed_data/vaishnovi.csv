"event","i finished my durga collage and put up an image on my site. i think i'll have to photograph it instead of scanning it in (as i did), because due to the 3D nature of the beads, her face is out of focus. still, it gives you an idea... let me know what you think!

"event","okay - nothing's finished yet, but soon i'll have a brand spanking new web site:

http://www.durgasdaughter.com

i'm planning to create musical soundscapes that blend devotional chanting/singing, with recorded sounds of places (india and otherwise) with electronic music... ambitious - yes ! there will also be other simpler 
little pieces of music-y type stuff. 

it's this weird creative drive that's springing up.... it's got to be let out of its cage!!!

for the cover page, i'm working on this really bizarre collage i'm creating of durga from pieces cut out from fashion mags. 

more soon my lovelies !"

"event","we went to a wedding in niagara falls yesterday. it was nice, but the disturbing thing was that betta fish were used for decorations. since when are fish the equivalent of flowers? they were in bowls on the tables with a floating candle, and the water was covered with sparkles. how were they to breathe??

the one on our table was already dead when we arrived at the reception.

there was one in a tiny bowl in the bathroom. i longed to bring it home, but wasn't sure how to sneak it out. as we were leaving, the groom joked that we could take a fish home. i pounced on the opportunity to ask if i could take the one from the bathroom and he could only say yes. so for the 1.5 hour drive home, i held it in my hands and only spilled a little water.

we named him weaver, after the groom's last name. he is now installed in my old fish bowl with a floating plastic lotus and a blue glass hidey hole. i hope he gets comfortable and rested. he has been through hell.

he is on a shelf where scotty (the cat) cannot jump or even see him.

he is red."

This is truly amazing. Be sure to click on NEXT PAGE at the bottom of each page; there are 5 pages in all. A woman found a hummingbird nest and got pictures all the way from the egg to leaving the nest.

"event","Today, I saw an older lady pick one of the free morning papers out of the recycling bin at the subway station. I thought that was really considerate. 

Even though she had trouble walking, she rushed down the stairs to make the train. When I spied her from the top of the second set of stairs, she wasn't running anymore. I knew the train had arrived on the other side."

"event","yesterday evening, i was in my friend lisa's washroom. it's really old with dusty grey tiles and her 4-year-old son's bath toys were scattered about. 

a tiny, grey silverfish crawled out from a pale and crumpled towel. it looked so graceful as it navigated from terry cloth to tile. i felt a rush of love."

"event","Deepak bought me this great Diwali gift. For seven years, ever since I first saw them in India, I've wanted a backlit picture of a deity. They have them all over Delhi (I'm sure the whole country). It's a transparent image backlit by two rotating coloured circles. The effect is a beautiful, wild pattern of light around the picture. 

I could never buy one in India because of the different power plug, but they've got them in Little India in Toronto now. We needed an image of Lakshmi for our Diwali Pooja tonight, so he bought me the Lakshmi one. It is gorgeous ! 

This morning I was doing my meditation in front of it. When I looked at Lakshmi Mata's hand, I felt as if it were holding mine. And then I felt my arms around her neck. It was such a happy meditation in contrast to the one of the other day. I felt it was a great Diwali gift to feel Lakshmi Mataji so close to me."

"event","Yesterday when I was chanting Loka Samastha Sukhino Bhavantu, I focussed all my thoughts on Delhi. The news of the bombings affected us deeply, as that is where our second home is and that is where our parents live. (No one we know was hurt.) 

I was thinking about all the mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, friends who lost loved ones. I pictured one small boy on a stretcher. I could feel him in my arms and I was kissing his forehead and brushing the hair from his eyes. I was weeping uncontrollably, which started to happen in reality as well as in my mind's eye."

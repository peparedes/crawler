As the words start to die
Charge this battle foward
Burn the fires into the night
And the man with the mask
stares down at me
A soft grin thats barely fragile 
And so violent so quitely
Then and there his eyes
Go so white and intense
With that grin he gave me
He kills all my friends

Say goodnight...
Rest in peace...

One day I will take him down (Ohhhh)
His blood and breath will be mine (Ohhhh oh-e-oh)
And for the cold-hearted courtesy (Uh uh oh oh-e-oh)
For him I will not be kind (Woah)
I am not afraid (Woah)
My eyes are quite wide (Woah oh uh oh oh)
For I am the savior (Woah)
I'm the Lord of the Battlecry
(Ohhhh ohhh oh-e-oh)

There's no blood on my hands
But I've got hate in my heart
I'll never let my head rest
After this conquest makes its start
And you're all but shadows now
In my mind, in my soul
The fuel to the feed the engine
Pumping me like I'll never know

Say goodnight...
Rest in peace...


Say goodnight!
Rest in peace!
And to arms!
And here's to your memory!
Blood-stained thoughts!
Of your face...es


A whoa oh a oh oh
Woah a oh e oh-oh
(Woah-oh
Oh-oh
Oh oh oh whoa whoa)

And in these moments
In this time
What's always been forbidden
Is no longer a crime"

That's about the time that I drift away
Taking time just to think about everything
Watch the lights and the technicolor dreams
I try to think of what you mean to me
And all I can think of
(All I can think of)
Is everything I want life to be

So let's walk down this road
Away from the town where we used to be
No destination in mind
Just a place here to hide, a place for you and me
Down the line
When you are mine
We'll look back on this old town
And as its burning down
My burning heart
Will be the light to lead the way
So we go

On and on and on and on and on
Forever
That's where we'll stay
So burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
As we leave this town

And the salt grazes the purple night
And it all shines in your eyes
But like they reflect
I'm just a mirror for your life
So what you see is never me
It's just an outlet for misery
So take the fire and burn it out
Turn it all into an ""X""
I'll take tonight
I'll take tonight
Singing
As we go

I'll take tonight
I'll take tonight
Singing
""Susan, you mended the broken heart
Healing my wounds with a kiss
When we part I will miss you""
(Tonight, is the end of an enflamed heart
Broken by the sounds of insanity
But sanely ending me)
[Down the road
Away from here
We'll watch the flames light the sky]"

and, honestly, I want to say screw that and I want to say how much I don't believe that bullshit, but it's true. 

I hate it.
Something has to work.
Maybe it is working.
Maybe I'm thinking too much of it.
If it's not now, maybe it will work.
Yeah, I'm thinking too much.

What will the critics think?
I'm gonna have to lie to them.
I have to make them think it's all okay.
Think the music will go on.
The curtain won't fall.
Not on my watch.
I like this song and I'm not gonna let it's melody be silenced.
Because you know it's perfect and you're just scared to keep listening.
But I can't force you to listen.
I'm just hoping you will.

Wonder if I'm wasting my time
Holding my cavity closed
When you're all opened up
It's something you've always known
And fragile as it is
It's a muscle the same
Stronger with this tramua
But still for you so plain

Yeah it's a shame

I can't hold my hands still
Or keep my mind in mind
Yeah, I'm wasting my time

Yeah I'm clumsy enough
And unexperienced so much
But I want everything to be
The way it once was
But I see a light fading
Can't avert the truth
Haven't done it all
But I want to do it all with you

It's a shame too

I can't hold my hands still
Or keep my mind in mind
Yeah, I'm wasting my time

So
Why does the story end?
And how
How will we be in the epilouge?
Because I'm just not seeing it all
When your leaving my house
Are you leaving my mind?
Wanna say whatever
But I'm just wasting both our time

I can't hold my hands still
Or keep my mind in mind
Yeah, I'm wasting my time

Nothing's done in a day
Nothing's done that way
Nothing's an unwritten page
Nothing's my age
Nothing's so tense
Nothing's so unexperienced
Nothing's so wrong
Nothing's holding on
So hard

That's an original piece kiddos. I call it ""Cavity"""

This paranoia is direct resuly of everything I ever wanted 
Your heart, your soul, your beauty

And I'll lose you in my thoughts
The days apart aren't days complete
You are everything to me

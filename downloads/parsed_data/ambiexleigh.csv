"event","i just typed an entire update, and then it all got deleted.
i talked to chris.  i found out all i needed to know.  he says i dont understand but i think i do.  no im not going to write about him the entire time.  he says he hates me.  well life was so much easier before i started dating.  so im done.  im thirteen.  there are a lot of people that can make me feel the way he made me feel.  if i can have it now i can have it anytime.  im going into highschool.  so i need to worry about my grades, and building myself to be a better person before i get seriously involved and start planning out my future with some guy at the age of thirteen.
i have plenty of fun hanging out with al, and my friends, and going to church, concerts, partys.  i have to admit i did like the feeling of having someone tell me they love me.  well my family loves me.  and al cares for me, and im sure her family does too.  thirteen is kind of young.  i need need this.  i dont need to worry about my ex-boyfriend telling me i ruined his life. yes. i did hurt him.  i know that, but he hurt me too, and i dont need to feel that at this age.  its time for me to go have fun.  im still a kidd okay. (right...*winkwink*)  im feeling alright. really i am.  i only miss the idea of him, and even that is going away.  thatks to talks ive had with al, and kat, and such.  there is so much to live for.  life is so amazing the way it takes its toll.  my life is definately going to be an outrageous path."

i wish there i was no such thing as love now...or atleast heartbreak.  i wish it were all over.  fuck my fairytale now, and why not put love right into it.  i'm smart enough to get the job i want.  and i can always adopt kids.  i can be independant, and i don't need no form of pleasure to be a perfect person.  my life can to better...it can be perfect if i want it to.  you kno what why don't i just be a fuckin barbie doll.  then i'll be perfect. yeahyeahyeahyeah!

Have a friend, calls me up
Says hello, then hangs up
He must have read my mind
These are the days of a diffrent paradigm
Maybe once, even twice
He said "" God does not play dice ""
Yet if he's everywhere
He's in casinos with aces to spare

Oh, Love is God's mistake
Oh, Love is God's mistake

Ours is not to reason why
As we fall from way up high
Into the water
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Even now, God's mistake
Sets us up for one more heartbreak
God you look mighty fine
Dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime

Oh, Love is God's mistake
Oh, Love is God's mistake
Never was so much at stake
Oh, Love is God's mistake"

"event","<p>Bit of interest lost again in Live Journal for a while, I finid it easier to get the time to post when I'm back at my parents. Anyway exams start Monday with a nice written exam on web programming not really looking forward to it, then I have a multiple choice exam Wednesday on software development (a step up from a written exam but I prefer programming exams designing UML, implementing UML into a framework and adding functionality) to be honest isn't going to be too bad and finally again a multiple choice exam on Telematics and Communication the following Monday.<br /><br />I haven't done a great deal of revision but I have placed all my projects on hold for the duration of the exams, I have been messing around with a 2D Scroller called ""Ninja Stick Dude"", don't ask about the name lol it came from a drunk night out... I managed to finish all my projects and coursework for this semester within the set time period.<br /><br />While being back at uni I have fell in love with a drink called Kopparberg its a Swedish pear cider, its so fkin nice I can drink it like coke but its a tad more potent than coke being 4.5% and it comes in half litre bottles YUM!<br /><br />Got smashed last Tuesday and was hanging out in the local bar, funniest sight in there ever.... some chick came into the bar with toilet paper sticking out her thong.... and she sat at the bar on one of the stools which ment her back was facing the entire bar, got a few giggles.<br /><br />Anyway I'm gonna tie this up with a picture of my view from window at University, Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.n3tw0rk.co.uk/images/offsite/window_uni.jpg""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://www.n3tw0rk.co.uk/images/offsite/window_uni_thumb.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />[<a href=""http://wwww.n3tw0rk.co.uk/images/offsite/window_uni.jpg"">Click to enlarge</a>] Also to note that bar in the bottom right was the one I was in last Tuesday :)</p>"

"event","I've been outside! Yes, its true I've been out a few times even went on the lash, none of it was that enthralling though lol... 

Anyways been off the whole geeky bit for a bit, been watching a lot of CSIs and Chris Farley movies recently. So my adventures have been limited if anything; met&nbsp;Lee n&nbsp;popped into my old college last friday, no one was there so we left n came back to my parents and someone had parked across my parents bottom drive and were doing work on the neighbours fence without asking my parent's permission to be on the property so i asked them to move off the property which they did. Time went on a bit and my dad came back from work, the workers vans were still there so he kicked off at them and after a few words they finish for the day and left. Myself and Lee went back to town for a bit and took a walk around the river Dee, we didn't stay long and were laughing at some kids setting some field on fire... bit odd but funny cause they were shittin themselves about setting it on fire. 

Wen to Bex's on Monday&nbsp;with Lee and Craig, we were supposed to have a BBQ but didn't have the BBQ lighters there n couldn't be arsed to go get them so Bex offered to cook inside while we were drinking and playing sing star on the PS2, we did that for pretty much the rest of the night apart from a trip to Tesco and to the park across the road. When i got back in I went straight to bed n work up at 4am to puke my brains out. 

Just been to college today to see a few old people and see what has changed there since I been to uni (not much...), anyway I'll wrap this up because I want to get some work done, been writing&nbsp;a program that serializes C++ Objects (its for the Open Source Strategy I'm working on, it creates serialized objects which are loaded when the object is called; instead of saving the object to memory or a temp database)."

"event","<p>Sorta missing uni atm, I've been home one week; time is passing fast enough but I feel like i'm wasting my life away tbh... I spent the last 2 days reconfiguring Visual Studio 2005 and my PCs&nbsp;overall running environment just so I can compile the Source SDK. For all intensive purposes the Source SDK compiles fine, except for one tool which is driving me&nbsp;spare. For some reason Valve's vrad tool used for lighting maps in&nbsp;Valve's Hammer mapping tool; is throwing back Linker Errors, I don't know why but this one error is stopping me from even plaaying with the Source Engine on a mental level.<br /><br />When I do something I like to do it right knowing one thing won't work will hold me back when it comes to putting effort into a project; if I were to solve the problem I would be really hyped up and start playing with the engine right now! I'm border line whiping this system (not just for the source sdk compiling, but my system is sluggish as hell at the moment), my main hard drive is a total mess; since I have made big alterations to the system I have left core data all over the disk so it can't even defrag properly.<br /><br />Anyway enough about the geek in me at the moment; which tbh is the only thing going for me since the last post as I haven't gone anywhere or done anything since...<br /><br />So anyway I'll wrap it up there, hopefully I'll have something interesting to post next time I do...<br /><br />Just decided to format my system so next time&nbsp;I post I'll let you know how that went.</p>"

I think that aggression thing is a passing phase hopefully it will go totally soon, I haven't felt good like this for a while, but then again I haven't had my next few days planned out like this b4 either.

I have been in quite a lot of pain reciently from body building, i'm not sure if that is the cause of my aggressive feelings, I have cut down my work out a bit and spread it out in the day more, I have been getting pain from my neck and hands (before you ask yes I do use a Weight Belt and Weight Lifting Gloves, personally I think I need knee support too).

I'm gonna shoot off go work out.

"event","<P>Well as the subject says christ i'm BORED!!!!!!! AGH!!!!! AGH!!!! !!! !!!</P>
<P>Anyway not much been happening I been working on a few things along with some super hero mod stats in PHP/MYSQL along with working on Arms Dealer (which is coming on nicely coding wise, I have got past a lot of big milestones in the project and the Alpha V0.1 will be released soon).</P>
<P>Enough geek talk for a moment, I have dropped quite a big of weight recently, I think I need to shop more yesterday's dinner was plain pasta on bread (no butter) lol, it sucked tbh. I need to work out more I think I am getting too skinny in my arms, I do an average body building session of 1-2 hours a day 50 reps with 80lbs bench, 300 reps with 20lbs dumb bells lying down and 100 while standing up, 25 press-ups 100 sit ups and 5 miles on the exercise bike. There is still quite a long way to go until I reach my ideal peak but I'll try to get more exercise in.</P>
<P>I'm getting quite worried I haven't been out in ages and I think I'm turning too pale, errr whitey lol. I really want to go to town on the bus today but as it's Sunday and arriva sucks there are no busses.... I think what I fear is true that bird I fancy that gets on my bus has gone to university, so me being pissed off with my self was right, if I wanted to stand a chance I have kicked my self in T3H NUT5 hard by fearing rejection and not talking to her while I had the chance, man I suck.</P>
<P>I am thinking of taking up either Boxing or Kick Boxing, at first I thought I wanted to take up a martial art but I don't I have a lot of pent up aggression that I really should vent b4 I do something stupid and pick a fight with like someone I will regret fighting.</P>
<P>I think I'm quite low at the moment all I want to do is work out/code and go looking for fights.... I'm getting worried with my self maybe it's lonely ness or too much built up rage and I should be more of a chilled person, I need to buy a punching bag, or get walls that when I punch I don't need to re plaster them, that reminds me I've gotta paint that wall I did plaster it and sanded it down I just forgot to paint it. I was wondering would getting into a fight help me out? If I win it would I feel regret or accomplishment and if I lost would I feel even worse?.... I'm gonna try to avoid fighting as much as I can but if it comes down to it I'll stand up for my self and get into a fight but until that happens I'll not go looking for one.</P>
<P>My mate lee is coming back from Leeds tomorrow so we can go and chill and maybe I will start to feel better? I wish I could of gone to the Leeds but I'm skint.</P>
<P>Anyway I'm gonna wrap this up and go do some coding then go work out.</P>

"event","<P>Sundays are always quite boring I am not sure why like but they just are, twas an interesting day yesterday, I went down to town to catch up with a few mates; the day started well we just hung around the park and then my mate gets a call off his auntie to go meet her down in weather spoons (a bar) so we head down there we get a few drinks, well this is the problem my mate lee's girlfriend is under 18 and the manager comes over and asks her to leave and this guy called jamie a friend of lee's family starts kicking off at the manager and tries to get him out side, i was standing there like ""oh god here we go"", well jamie does calm down and me lee and alice leave (well we find out later that jamie kicked off again and another friend of lee's family lee joined in and they get thrown out and bared). After that we go down to the park and meet up with Nick and head down to the river and we get a boat out, so we are rowing down the river and there are&nbsp;about 10 -12&nbsp;skallies(The scum of scum of britian they are ALL fags got a problem with me if you are reading this and your a skally you are officially a tard&nbsp;, here's something i agree with <A href=""http://www.forum.scallycentral.com/viewtopic.php?p=9914"">Should Skallies Be Shot?</A>&nbsp;and for you who don't know what they are <A href=""http://www.scallycentral.com/"">Skallies</A>) standing on the bridge and we row past and they start trowing stones at the boat, the fuckers missed me, nick and lee and hit alice (this i didn't find out till l8r or i would of started&nbsp;on em), i started yelling abuse at them (and quote ""ONE OF THOSE FUCK WANKERS ON THE BRIDGE&nbsp; THREW THE FUCKING STONES, I'M GONNA FUCKING CAIN YOU"" not the best abuse i could of thrown but meh)&nbsp;not entirely sure what they shouted back but i was well up for a fight, that well put me in a bad mood. Anyways we headed back into town I and Nick&nbsp;wanted to go down to the park and go look for them, but we choose not to and met up with a load of mates down in town and headed to the commerce where we met up with more ppls, we just hung around the commerce from that point then we all went home and that was about the end of the day...</P>
<P>Anyway that was my vent from yesterday</P>"

"event","<P>This was gonna be a very political post by me on Iraq but I thought screw it i'm not political Idon't even watch the news..... I do if i'm on it (I haven't been yet but you never know...)</P>
<P>I've just been chilling for the past few days, mainly playing Games, Watching DVD's, Listening to Music or passing funny bodily functions, which I find humerious a large margin of the time, sad I know but that basically sums me up. Me summed up is Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Farting, Burping and if i'm feeling exotic maybe some coughing and Sneeziing.</P>
<P>One thing is for sure I hate holidays off college, all my mates work and being currently unemployed is a pain (totally skint at the moment), I have got 3 holidays planned out this year and 1 i'm probably gonna have to drop soon if I don't get a job. At current i'm going to; Los Angeles in May to see the <A href=""http://www.e3expo.com/"">E3 Games Trade Show</A> (WOOHOO!), <A href=""http://www.downloadfestival.co.uk/intro/index.asp"">Download Festival</A>&nbsp;in Donington (which may be the holiday I have to cancel if I don't get a job) and Finally going to Aberporth with a load of mates for a week (Aberporth is Mid-South&nbsp; Wales and is one hell of a place to go on Holiday with Mates, the place we are staying in next to some Clifs next to the ocean which are ace for jumping off).</P>
<P>I really could do with going out this week or next and getting wasted, I really need to....</P>"

"event","<P>Ok I have just read what I posted last night in my sleep deprived state... And i'm like WTF what a load of bollocks I shouldn't be allowed to use the internet when I haven't slept in over 40 hours. Makes you think though, I think I really need a girl friend and some casual sex couldn't go a miss I suppose.</P>
<P>Anyway the post about Tuesday was correct that was a wicked day, bit boring towards the end though. The weather is really shit today as it has been since Friday I wish the weather would improve so me and my mates could have a cool day out. It's been pretty boring holiday so far I really hope it improves, having a good ol fight with a bunch of skallies wouldn't go a miss. </P>
<P>I just noticed something I really tend to use the same phrases over and over again, odd....</P>
<P>This two weeks off is college work free and work free so I got a lot of spare time, I just hope the weather improves so me and me crew can go hang around Chester and meet some more hot birds.</P>
<P>I really need to get a Digi Cam, I've got the money but it's just trying to find a good one.</P>"

"event","<P>I suppose i'm alive I guess, although I could be dead and this could be heaven or hell meh what do I know? I suppose you make of what you make of your own universe, this could be someones idea of the perfect world and others idea of the perfect damnation!</P> <P>Anyway back to me I suppose this is MY journal (took me 4 times to spell journal right and it's at the top of the bloody screen, jesus christ i'm thick as two shits), I will be here to abuse it and give you my insights to my world view to whatever that may be.... Also I will be talking about the amazing world of James Lockhart and erm whatever my life sucks in general, wana know the man/boy behind the journal twat writing the crap or me even. I talk a lot of bollocks when i'm tired or bored or when ever i'm in the mood to type I suppose.</P> <P>Well today's total bollocks will about the view of ture love, for someone who has never experienced true love (maybe i'm heartless of something or whatever). Love in this mordern age of dish washers and tables is based on&nbsp;sexual attraction in this day and age it's hard to define love, most would die for their so called loved ones because they need them for something, it's probably something small like doing the house work, a good shag and as we see now a days it's based on money, I personally belive it's to stop people feeling alone but then is that not the defintion of love? Love is what you make it....</P> <P>My theory of love:</P> <P><EM>""Love is but a dream, that's why I'm always asleep with you....""</EM></P> <P>Yes,&nbsp;I did come up with that all by my-self amazing isn't it, I do belive true love is a dream but could you ever experience true love out side your own reality? I hate artists (not the ones that paint pretty thingies but the ones that sing total bullshit) they sing about love or so called feelings but do these artists really have thse feelings? DO THEY BOLLOCKS! True feelings should be kept between you and a loved one, not with the entire world. </P> <P>Why i moan about love? God knows maybe my life is so depraved of love I wanted to have a good whine about love? Maybe so maybe not, I could have no true feelings of love for anyone! What difference does it make, hmmmm maybe I just need a good shag?</P> <P><U>My Life</U></P> <P>After my rant I feel a little better, it's nice to get things off your chest. Anyways college has ended for another 2 weeks oh joy 2 weeks of utter boredom, maybe if i knocked my-self out out every day of the holidays it would pass faster? Well I have a wall and i'm dense so I'm equipt for the mean time, shame I got a hard head i'll probably give my self a concussion while trying to do it...</P> <P>Oh I saw 3 of the stars in town (Chester w000000!)&nbsp;from Holly Oaks on Tuesday, well I suppose I could call them stars they are on TV I suppose that's enough....</P> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr> <td width=""33%""> <a href=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/backstage.asp?bs=2&cID=10""> <IMG src=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/images/backstage/profiles/AbbyDaviesa.jpg"" width=""152"" height=""85"" alt=""Abby Davies [Helen Nobel]"" border=""0""></a></td> <td width=""33%"" align=""center""> <a href=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/backstage.asp?bs=2&cID=18""> <IMG src=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/images/backstage/profiles/LeeHuntera.jpg"" width=""152"" height=""85"" alt=""Lee Hunter[Alex Carter]"" border=""0""></a></td> <td width=""34%"" align=""right""> <a href=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/backstage.asp?bs=2&cID=29""> <IMG src=""http://www.hollyoaks.com/images/backstage/profiles/ZaraMorganb.jpg"" width=""152"" height=""85"" alt=""Zara Morgan [Kelly Greenwood]"" border=""0""></a></td> </tr> </table><P>Shame I didn't have a camera with me....</P> <P>Tuesday was a laugh in general me and a few mates went on a wonder round town, we started off by going to Nice and Naughty (Porn Shop). Me,&nbsp;lee and lee&nbsp;were poking this big sex doll in the corner of the room and basically acting like childs, we did find out that they were looking for staff so we went down to the Library to write us some CVs, but all the PCs were in use till 7pm so we thought screw that and met up with another mate and carried on our exploration. Lee was complaining he needed some condoms so we headed off to the hospital woah what a long ass walk (bout 2 miles), god damn I'm a lazy ass.... Anyway we got to the hospital and headed down to the Sex Eduction ward, Lee went up to the counter and asked for condoms and some leaflets (he asked for them so we didn't sound like we just went there for condoms.....) we were sitting there reading about sexual diseases and laughing at them, back to the immature kids again.... Once we got them (80 condoms in the end and split them out between the 4 of us so we got 20 each, 20 dust collectors for me)&nbsp;we headed out to the hills round the back of the hospital and Lee blew up a condom and threw it down a hude hill, pointless really but we were just chillin.</p><p>After that we headed back into town and to the bus stop where some little kid came up to us and goes ""HAHAHAHAHA You've got condoms! You have sex with girls!"", we were sitting there going Ok whatever..... but he proceeded to anoy us and we wern't in the mood so we were gonna put a condom on his head, but lee couldn't catch him. In the end Lee put a condom on his hand and slowly walked up to him and started to rub it in his face he screamed and ran off which we all found funny. We all hung around the bus stop for bout half an hour....</P> <P>Me and Lee headed off and the other Lee met up with another mate Paul and they headed off in a different direction to fix his bike. Me and Lee went to the Northgate Arena (Swimming pool and Gym) to meet his girl friend, once we found her we went to sit down in&nbsp; the cafe and her friend was with her. Me and Lee emptied our pockets of condoms onto a table and they ran off in embarrassment, needless to say. we didn't hang around long before I got a lift home with my sister. And that sorta ended my day, I just went home and watched TV for the rest of the day (exciting.....).</P> <P>That summed up an exciting entry for me, bet anyone who reads this can't wait for the next.....</P>"

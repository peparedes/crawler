That's all, as much as I do want him, I just want a friendship. What good is it when he doesn't want anything to do with me, right? Ahh, everything in my life was going well...friends, school, family...now it's all the way it was before. I feel that they hate me, our relationship seems to be fading and it feels more and more ackward to talk to them. I hope it doesn't turn out bad. I love them so much and I don't want to be left out how I used to be. Soon they'll stop calling, we'll become more distant...it'll be weird. *sigh* I hope to god that everything will be better than ever next week. I cannot believe that this is my life. That I had to turn out the way I am...they do think I'm weird...I know it. Well, I really don't care what they say. Wait...I do. I really do. It can't be that bad, right? Oh no...I hope not. It was an experience of a lifetime...with him...oh my god. Everything it so surreal, but this week has been ackward! We're making it ackward! what's wrong with saying something?! What will be embarrassing? nothing. Nothing at all, but I can't. I can't look at him...you know why...because he knows I like him and he doesn't like me. So...I hope he doesn't assume I'm thinking something will happen. Shit. I don't. I hate you all. I hate myself...I hate my awful situation that I'm in. Can't do anything to change the way he feels.

"event","Something has really made me think. If you look back someone commented on one of my entries. Very honest opinion. Brutally honest I must say. It's not that I want to be a clone just to fit in. The way I feel about myself is so bad sometimes it makes me think these stupid things about the way I dress, the way I look...brazilian jeans you know? It just gets really bad."

"event","[I'm Quite The Loser...A lack Of Self-Confidence.]

People tell me: ""Britt! OMG! your not a loser! Your my friend!""
I have NO good friends were I moved. Those who say I'm not a loser don't show me friendship at all. They don't aknowledge my presence. You wouldn't understand what I mean. It may look like I'm happy at school, but honestly I'm not. I tell my parents and sister everything is fine when it's not. I have to deal and live with the fact that I'm not the coolest person but that I'm the one with 0 friends...good nice, thoughtfull friends. Doesn't make sense, but it does to me."

"event","I feel so mellow. I woke up and looked outside. It's cold and the sky is grey and it throws my mood off completely. Weather like that makes me...honestly...depressed. I hate saying it but it's true. My parents are talking secrectly about something they dont want me to hear. I know what it is anyway. Their always having problems with that stuff. The house is quiet and empty now. They've gone out. An hour ago, I went downstairs by myself, put on Micheal Jackson and drew a picture of a lady. Her pink hair was blowing in the wind and her makeup was running down her face in sadness. She has dark grey/brown lips and is very beautiful. I should post it sometime.  Odd entry."

"event","My neck hurts, my wrists hurt, my legs hurt, my shoulders hurt. Everything. I got home from school and changed. I looked in the mirror today and saw the ugliest person in the world. I took my hair out, brushed it and clipped it back. I put two inches of eyeliner on to feel nice about myself. I'm very not depressed, but...sad...today. 
I feel like slamming myself into a wall and breaking the light switch while I'm at it. I'm un-popular, apparently I'm not attractive, I don't have nice clothes...that are appropriate for my age. The girls are wearing brazilian jeans and I have pants six sizes too big for me. Fuck. I need clothes, a haircut and a dye job. 
I'm not myself today. I feel like crying, I don't know why..."

"event","I am so pissed of right now. Last year I moved to this new town and new school. Nobody talked to me. No one made an effort to make me feel comfortable I had to fend for myself. This year there was a ""new girl"" in my class. I was friendly and was very nice to her cause' I know what's it's like being new. All of a sudden the popular girl's decide they want her in their ""click"". DO THEY PICK AND CHOOSE WHO THEY WANT TO TALK TO? cause' when I was new there they didn't even aknowledge my presence. That ""new girl"" acts like she doesn't even know me now. All of a sudden she's so popular and ""cool"".  FUCK this is soo annoying! It's seriously pissing me off. Fuckers."

This year there was this ""new kid"" and I was nice to her and hung out with her for like...2 days. Then the popular girls decided to include her in their click. Do they fucking pick and choose who they want to talk to? Cause' when I was new there THEY DIDNT'T AKNOWLEDGE ME! WHAT THE FUCK? IT PISSES ME OFF cause' now she acts like she doesn't know me. I made it okay for everyone to talk to the ""new girl"" so they do. Fuck that shit. This bugs the fuck out of me. NOw she's all cool after 3 weeks. Fuckers."

"event","I'm so god damn bored. I just watched Kill Bill Volume.2...it wasn't what I expected at all. Too much dialogue, the first one is way better. It's 1:01 am. My sister is watching American History X. I should be watching it but I'm not in the mood for another movie. Besides it's a full week rental. My eyes feel heavy and I have intergestion. Boo...I should go to bed. Knowing I have to wake up to a Sunday that will end before I know it and bring me a Monday, a full seven day week of school. Oh man. I don't know. I'm contemplating whether I should watch American Histor X; A tale of racisd skin-heads. Hmm...Nah. I'll sit here and be bored. Yeah much better. (For when I go to bed: Good Night)"

"event","It's my first entry. I'm incredibly bored and I'm going to go out in exactly 35 minutes. To the park with my ""friends"" not that I want to but it's something to do. The kids in this town act so little. Calling me and asking me if I want to go over and play boardgames with their families? Sheesh. NO THANKS. I'm going to go to the park and sit there and watch them play basketball. *rolls eyes* Meh. Nothing better to do. My gut feels almost nervous. I don't know why. I know. It's Saturday and I'm thinking about going to school on Monday and facing my crazy witch teacher. I've always been scared of school. So STOP IT Britt and have fun. I really don't want to go, but there's a chance I might run into *coughs* **** *coughs* I can't say his name. I think I'll go now. Blaah I don't want too. Oh well. 
                                                     Bye, Britt"

~Andrew: Why do you have to insult everybody? 
John Bender: I'm being honest, asshole.~
~Andrew: We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.~ 
~Claire Standish: You know why guys like you knock everything? 
John Bender: Oh, this should be stunning. 
Claire Standish: It's because you're afraid. 
John Bender: Oh God, you richies are so smart, that's exactly why I'm not heavy into activities. 
Claire Standish: You're a big coward.~
~Andrew: Speak for yourself. 
Bender: Do you think I'd speak for you? I don't even know your language.~
~Richard Vernon: Well, well. Here we are. You have exactly eight hours and fifty-four minutes to think about why you're here. You may not talk, you will not move from these seats. Any questions? 
John Bender: Yeah. Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?~
~John: Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? If he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy.~ 
~John Bender: YOU ARE A BITCH. 
Claire Standish: Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch? 
John Bender: NO. 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do someone, if you don't got the balls to stand up to who you like.~
~Vernon: Gimme that.
 Bender: I don't have it.
Vernon: You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you?
Bender: I don't have it. Screws fall out all the time, the worlds' an imperfect place.~

and such is my display of bordem. although...at work there was a power shortage. which was totally AWSOME (note sarcasm)"

"event","yay...today was good *dances* lol, asked hoggie out after tim and ellyse were extrememly nice and encouraging (no sarcasm!!!) and then he said yes (which came as a shcok)and then tim and llyse spent the next 30mins paying us out. and then we all went home. twas all very exciting.
today i found out that my biology assesment is actually due in tomorrow...that i didnt know. so now, instead of working on the second part...i am writing this. how good for me. maybe she'll just have forgotten about the essay *crosses fingers * i hope so...cos i dont feel like doing it. and apparently me and llyse have a friday for not going to a detention w/ miss worral (who should DIE)...which, by the way...i got told i didnt have to go to. so i am thoroughly confused about that. i suppose i should do the work anyway. yay for waking up early in the morning. *dances wildly* so i will...wake up at 4.30, start working at 5...get ready for school at 6ish, go to first period...fall asleep cos its BORING...then fall asleep in my next too. then soccer after school. oh the joys. at least i now have three travel mugs...so...i hope i still have one at home. cos that would be really helpful with the attempt at staying awake. 
i feel as if im rambling
we were meant to play a game today...against hornsby. except we didnt. cos it was raining. lol...but hennes said i still looked like shit (which was true) and i dont think i would have played anyway.but we have a game on thursday...yipee."

"event","wow, so ...tonight is the first saturday night that i'm actually home for, after mum and dad gave me a huge lecture last weekend about not spending a night at home since i arrived back...and theres no one else here. kinda defeats the purpose of family time, does it not? and so i am sitting here with pizza and brandy :s as one does. printing off a whole bunch of photos with the new things of ink i just brought.
isn't this just fascinating?
no...i didnt think so. lol.
im really quite bored, and in the mood for going out...but no...im being all good and nice.
i went to michael's soccer this morning...much to my complete and utter shock, he's actually quite good. although we both still jump into tackles, which is a habbit we need to kick (haha) quickly. wow...im so freaking WITTY. i crak myself up. oh the sadness. 
im really bored and theres nothing to do. im screwed for tomorrow, cos i left my tape at school on...wednesday? i think it was, and i still havent bought any more. and my knee is still all like ""wow, i want to be a pain in the arse"" and twingy etc etc. so yes. fascinating im sure. 
im sure i will write more...by then will most probably be drunken rambling about canada :s ho hum :)"

  All around me are familiar faces
  Worn out places, worn out faces
  Bright and early for their daily races
  Going nowhere, going nowhere
  And their tears are filling up their glasses
  No expression, no expression
  Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
  No tommorow, no tommorow

    And I find it kind of funny
    I find it kind of sad
    The dreams in which I'm dying
    Are the best I've ever had
    I find it hard to tell you
    'Cos I find it hard to take
    When people run in circles
    It's a very, very

    Mad world, mad world

  Children waiting for the day they feel good
  Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
  Made to feel the way that every child should
  Sit and listen, sit and listen
  Went to school and I was very nervous
  No one knew me, no one knew me
  Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
  Look right through me, look right through me

    And I find it kind of funny
    I find it kind of sad
    The dreams in which I'm dying
    Are the best I've ever had
    I find it hard to tell you
    'Cos I find it hard to take
    When people run in circles

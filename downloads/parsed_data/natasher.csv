"event","I spent a good week creating my top ten favorite songs of all time.  Honestly, I don't think my list is quite right yet.

1. Ronnie Lane - Annie
2. The Byrds - You Don't Miss Your Water
3. Elliott Smith - Twilight
4. Townes Van Zandt - Dead Flowers
5. Nick Drake - Northern Sky
6. Sam Cooke - Change Is Gonna Come
7. Leonard Cohen - Suzanne
8. Okkervil River - Kansas City
9. Arcade Fire- Cars And Telephones
10. Mercury Rev - Spiders And Flies

I should've started at ten but whatever. I feel like this list isn't right still. Agh."

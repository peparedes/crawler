"event","yea last night was really fun. me, devon, evan, and kay-dee had a great ime at the away football game. it was so funny because devon tried on brittanys sunglasses and wanted to see how she looked but there wasnt a mirror in the girls bathroom so i suggested that she look in the boys room and when she did she something other than a mirror..LMAO. during the half-time show our band sat in rosevilles bands bleachers, it was weird because some guys were taking pics of us with thier phones. after the show we followed rosevilles band into the bleachers and tried to fit in but it was kinda hard. one of the moms told us that we could sit next to the band but we couldnt associate with them but we did.... now we r going to hell. haha i took pics of their band. we made a plan that we are gong to screw the roseville band and everyone in roseville. we are going to make roseville babies. we took lots of cool pictures with my phone:). we went insane when the band had to leave us behind. we were screamming out to people that we were having a party and that we were gonna do roseville on the bus until we got in trouble. but we kept on saying roseville. then we started using the word roseville instead of swearing.... like, roseville you, you rosevilling mother roseviller. gavin joined in on the fun :). it was funny because no one had a clue what we were talking about.

i dont think anyone except for doug has read my live journal yet. o well.

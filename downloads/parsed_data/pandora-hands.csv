"event","So yeah.  I went to this Pub I've never been at before, wanting to get a bit of reading done, for it was night, and it was too chilly outside to read within nature...  And of course the library was closed.  So I went there, probably not the best of choices, but it was warm.  I sat in a little alcove in front of the fire, I was content, warm, and had my cup of hot tea.

Then a man named Casey came in, and he was a boisterous little thing.  He wandered right over to me, and started talking, never minding I was reading, calling me a wet blanket and whatnot.  I insisted I was not, and let him buy my a drink.  I had never met Casey before that night, though I am glad I did, he is an amusing lad...

He used to box apparently, and I will admit he looked a bit cute in his boxer shorts (He showed me a picture of him at the bar), but alas, I never was really into sports, so if he was trying to impress, he failed...  Or, maybe he was simply trying to make some conversation.

Either way, we sat, and chatted for a bit, just exchanging plesantries..."

"event","The last few months have been flat line for me, in the sense I have rarely ventured out.  That is, except to work, and go to class.  I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving break, and then Christmas, and then again when the semester ends.  I have not seen any of the people I have met, especially Kellan.  But Jack and Khalid are also among those.  Hell, I ain't even seen Mark, my 'boss'.  But that's fine, I always was a loner, and kept to myself a lot, perhaps that is why my answering machine is tauting me.  Yeah, I'm rambling.

Perhaps I'll call Kellan just to pick on him, I just don't bloody know."

"event","<b>Khalid:</b>
I went out to Stow Lake yesterday, and again today.

Yesterday, I was going to rent a canoe and drift along the lake, but to my sorrow they didn't rent them.  How could they not rent them?  I might have to buy my own, and hire a man to help carry it with me then, I need my canoe.  Anyway, as I was heading back to go home (as they did not have any canoes) I came across my Forest Walker fishing.  For some reason, picturing Khalid fishing was the last thing I would have done.

Anyway, we chatted a bit, he still hadn't gone to Moonlight Caress, so apparently we're going to try to get together and go sometime.  We'll see.  Anyway, we chatted a bit, before I had to leave, I had to go to work, otherwise we would have gone to the Caress that night, fate is a mean little Bastard at times.

<b>Jack:</b>
Again, I went out to Stow Lake.  However, this time I went for a morning jog, and it felt bloody wonderful, and it really cleared my mind, giving me some peace and quiet for a bit.  As I was getting ready to cross the bridge, I came upon a man who was merely standing there and thinking.  It's nice to know a man can still think.  His name is Jack.  We chatted for quite a while, about out jobs, my college interests, and it turns out that we both live in the same apartment building.  I told him I'd have to come by and get some sugar sometime, he said that he would need to stock up on sugar then.  After a long time of chatting, he then escorted me back to he apartment building, I mean honestly, he's an interesting man.  His favorite animal is a Hyena...  He made a comment about not liking to be in laps of old women...  he's not...  is he a...  I miss mortal men, where have they all gone?  It's so hard to tell nowadays just what exactly you're getting.  The conversation then went to Grandmothers and petting, but we put a stop to that pretty damn quick, what odd topics of conversation people can come up with.  In closing, Jack was adorable, perhaps I'll have to run into him more often.

-<-;<@

In regards to Edward and Kellan, I have not seen either of them for quite sometime.  I assume Edward is still happy with Cherise, and Kellan likewise with the pack.  Perhaps I'll call them in a few days.. Or perhaps I'll just let them be with their current situation, as I'm sure they need not a blast form the past, anymore as I need them."

"event","I craved the food that only the Happy Wok seems to get perfect.  So I went there, alone. 

Being alone did not last, however.  After I lost a battle of wits to a pair of chop sticks, Khalid spoke to me, his voice at first not ringing any bells, but his face, I did not forget it, even if we met only once.  A woman named Hope was sitting with him, she introduced herself as.. was it his quasi-adopted sister?  It was something along those lines.  She was very nice, and very pretty.  She sculpts, making jewelry.  I told her I worked at the Book Nook, and she expressed interest in perhaps seeing if the owner would let her sell her creations there, I told her to stop by and talk to him sometime and see.  So all three of us chatted and ate, it was nice.

Khalid got a few grossed out looks from me, for the man munched on whole chicken feet.  Made me want to go vegetarian.   Regardless of that, he was nice company.  After Hope left us, we chatted a bit longer.  He seems to either adore vampires, or he is merely curious with them.  I suggested he stop by the Moonlight Caress some night and take a gander at what goes on there, he said he just might have to.. Course he then had to go into speaking that he woulnd't have to wear.  Me being the typical female love clothes, so I offered to help him pick something out... Now that I think back on it, it sounds like a come on, but my comment was genuine... I wonder what he thinks.  Oh well.

He is good company though, hopefully I'll see him around."

Having gone there for my own little picnic and alone time, I thought that I would not be disturbed, I was wrong.  But then, it was not so much of a disturbance, than of crossing paths.

Khalid was his name.  He must have some nerves of steel, for he wore white into the forest, /white/!  Obviously he cares not for grass stains.  Anywho, we chatted a bit, then he left.  He was nice, if not a bit odd, but nice.

After he left, I packed up and followed suit shortly after, for night was about to set in to the full depths.  That, and I had to go fill out paperwork for the local college.  Bloody CPR and Sign Language classes, but then, there will also be Classical Literature."

"event","After all that has happened, I still adore Kellan.

He called me on the phone a few days ago, it was a pleasant surprise.  We chatted, and I ended up inviting him over for dinner sometime during the week, he agreed.

Tonight he came over.. well, last night I suppose would be more accurate.

I made dinner for him.  Oven ribs, baked potatoes with all the fixings, and string green beans for a vegetable.  For dessert, homemade cheesecake, with fresh cherry topping upon it.  I must say, the meal was utterly divine, I was even impressed with how it turned out.

We ate in a pretty quiet atmosphere, and only after we finished dessert, did we really speak.  We cleaned the table off, then we sat next to each other on the bed.  I then proceeded to tell him straight out, that I adored him, and I love him, but I don't know if I'm /in/ love with him. I might be, I might not be, but with happened with Edward, I don't /want/ to be, but do know that I do love him. I missed him terribly, and still want to date him. 

I also went on to tell Kellan, that I have fears about this not working, as I know he must have as well. However, I want this to work at least until it cannot anymore. In order to make this work, I don't want to hear about his sex life, nor will I tell him about mine... I then asked him if he /really/ wanted to see me, or is this like a form of pity, for him breaking up with me? 

Kellan responded that he really did want to be with me, and that he can live without speaking of his sex life, as he really does not want to hear about my own.  We were smiling, and I've never been so content with my baby at that moment than then.

After we talked of course, I pleasured him, then he pleasured me, then we had sex, then more sex, then a shower, then more sex, then that blessed cuddling as my body entwined with his as sleep came.  That night he was all mine, and we both were content to leave it at that.

He's once more my baby, and we're both happy with the current situation, granted, he's more so about it than I.  But, as I told him, I will adjust... I simply need to find another to help me adjust."

"event","After Kellan and I had our argument, I called the only other person I knew really.  Edward.

For some reason I just could not stand the thought of sleeping in my bed, or my apartment that night...  He said 'Sure, of course you can', so I packed up, and went out to spend the rest of the night roaming the town. Of course I found no entertainment, twas always hard to find some.

I said some harsh things to Kellan, but I do not apologize for saying them.  He needed to hear it, to know what he's doing.  Of course, not like there were not warning signs when he was with Tristan, but I ASKED him.  I ASKED him before, 'Kellan, will you not have a desire to be with another than me, like you were with Tristan?'  He said 'No'.  Well he can take that fucking no and choke his Wolf ass to death on it.

Huff.

Yeah I'm bitter.

Of course I am.

Yeah, and I submitted that application to Caress, we'll see if I get a nibble on that.  

So.  I was packed, and ready to head over to Edwards, when he calls me.  'Oh, I forgot.  It's close to the full moon.  Can't have Cherise tearing you apart.'  Granted, that's not what he said, I added some glamor.  

I went back to my apartment, fully sulking the whole way.

I'm glad I did, I got a phone call about an interview at Moonlight.

Yay.

Then not so yay.

Coat and Item check girl, a glamorous position if there ever was one, but it's a start, I suppose.

Oh, and Mark is a Rat King apparently, and Gabriel is Third in the City.  Freaking yay for them."

What is fuck is happening in the world?

Is monogamy so out of fashion?

So, I told him it was my birthday.

He then asked me what I wanted him to do.

I told him.

My 18th birthday is today.

He didn't know of course, I don't like to bring attention to myself.

Gifts, balloons, a big ordeal would be made...

I debated about not telling him... But I finally did.

I told him to kiss me, and date other people.

What the fuck ever, I doubt I'll see him anymore now that he has my consent.

Booty calls, I shall be reduced to booty calls.

He /actually/ blamed his Wolf on this.  I told him to stop making fucking excuses.

What a Bastard.

What.  A.  Bastard.

We're gonna 'date' other people.

No.  Kellan will fuck around, and I'll stay at home with ice cream and sob movies.

My favorite line of his, is... No, screw it, no reciting.

I asked him who he wanted.  You do not request to date other people without someone in mind.

I'm not surprised.  Not really, just.. sad.

He came over a few nights ago, seeming /really/ nervous about something, he just was not his normal Kellan self.  So, he finally told me he had to tell me something, he did, and I laughed...  I think he was mad that I didn't yell at him, perhaps that would have been better than laughing.

God I adore him.  I love his honesty with me as well.  Apparently he was watching a man mock fuck another man to show a new sexual position to him and a couple others.  Grace, yes Grace.  Then, Kellan got all hot and bothered, having ended up on the floor.. spent.  I simply asked him, had he touched someone, or had they touched him, he said no, so I wasn't mad.  

At first I simply blurted out in a fit of laughter, that he had been mind fucked by a vampire, but he said 'No, that's not it'.  So I don't know.  I'm only mortal, and still trying to get past my 'Just food status' which I blame on Edward.

So, I wasn't mad at him.  Go me.

He asked me if I wanted to come over to the new house and help him 'Christen' every single room.  I of course agreed.  Though that night, we were sure to practice our skills in my own apartment.

@>-;-'--

The day after that, we went over to his home.  Though as the alarm went off right when we got in, a female came to wander over, to see what the noise was about.  She was very nice, and very polite.  Had she not been a Wolf, I might have gotten huffy and puffy about the way she was nuzzling my man at times, but, I have come to begun to understand about the Wolves and the need for closeness, and I think Kellan was happy with my non angry reaction about the whole thing.

Her name was Alyssa, who is engaged, and works as a Vet.  Overall very nice.  She even answered a question I had about coming to terms with her 'beast', though somehow I get the feeling Kell did not approve of such a question.  She said she didn't mind, and if I, or Kell and I had any questions, to call her, and would be happy to help.  As I said, overall, very nice."

Well, perhaps I should say it differently as I make it sound like I'm always alone.

Take two.

I'm alone this night, Kellan not being at home, so I could not go crawl into his arms and get company.  Edward's not answering his phone... and those are really the only two people I know.  Well, know enough to call or hang around with.

Perhaps I should call Tibbalt, he's a friend, mortal as well I believe, and gay.

My flowers need a bit of fresh water I think, it's the bad thing with flowers from the florist, they rarely last that long...  That and Percy keeps pawing and or chewing on my dandelions, of all things.

God I'm bored.

I really need something to do with my spare time... I'm just so, restless, I feel like running along the beach, nude, alone and at night.  I might have, if it wasn't for the curfew...  Just go alone with no one else around.  Free spirits need to be free.  Or caged.

I need to go to college...

I need to tell Kellan, my secret...

But the question is, will he leave me when he knows?

I don't know, some men are... sticklers when it comes to this subject.

Edward didn't know, though I doubt he'd care...

It's Edward afterall.

Oh dearest Kellan, do you know?

Somehow I doubt it.

I'm rambling.  Ramblin' Rose.  It's an outlet of my boredom really.  If I knew for sure I would not be bored in jail, I'd sneak out and tip toe through the tulips with Tiny Tim on my arm.  Gallagher, of course, would be nude smashing watermelons, which we would feast upon as we all three copulate under the moon.

Right.

I wonder how Kellan would indeed feel about me seeking a job at Moonlight Caress...

Prolly hate it.

If he can sleep in nude piles, I can get a job at a sexually inclined club.

Maybe get my ass nice and red infront of strangers, before... Mmmm, now I'm just being bitter.

Tis happens when I'm alone for too long with my thoughts, alone.

Self-destruction at it's best...

I think the fighting is past us, at least for a while.  We both said what we had to say, got angry about it, and now we have made up.  He is so adorable.  What a surprise I had when he came over in a suit bearing flowers!  I have my arm deep in water, arranging fake corral for my new fish tank when he knocked on my door.  

Oh God, the flowers, they were the most beautiful I have ever seen...  I love dandelions.

We talked, forgave each other, then got down to the wonderful of make up sex.  My poor bed, I had just made the sheets before he arrived, of course Kellan being Kellan, stripped down and purposefully messed my bed up...  I laugh now to myself thinking of how he looked... But then again I was quick to join him, wasn't I?

Anyway, going to go shopping for Kellan later today, not fair that I had gotten Edward a gift, and not Kellan...  For Kellan is more to me than the vampire ever was, Edward was... Edward, special in his own way, but never my Darling like Kellan has become."

Kellan finally came over to see me as he said he would the other day.  It was the night the ghouls were running around in the streets below.  I.  Like a good human and mortal, sat my ass in my apartment, only now and then peeking outside to what was going on below.  It was not cowardly, it was smart, and Kallen would have been mad something fierce if I went out there to help.  What could I really do anyway?

So he came over, and we chatted.  He first thought I was Edward's Pomme again because he had fed from me, I had to make sure that he understood, that Edward was just a friend, who was a vampire.  Vampires need to eat, and he had not yet that night.  Kell basically said 'fine fine, just let me know when you donate blood'.  That hurdle was past...

Then he set one up for me that I not only jumped over, but I stumbled, tripped, and fell flat on my face.  Yes it hurts, and yes tears came, even if they were brief.

How nice to know that pawing each other, and sleeping in naked huddles is part of the Wolf lifestyle.  'Don't mind me if my hands happen to go up another's shirt'.  I laid there comatose for several long moments before I could even speak to him, letting me comes to terms of understanding than anger.  My better half finally kicked in, and I did understand.  I don't like it, what sane girlfriend would?  But I understood what he needed, for he is what he is.

That brought us to another topic of discussion, 'How would you feel if I had fur?'  Horror, pain, fear, all of these passes over his face, but not relief... I was looking for relief.  He scolded me.  I thought.. he would have been happy to hear me tell him that...  But no, he was horrified, 'Why would I want to do that?  You don't understand what you're saying!'  No, I don't.  I don't know hardly anything about them, except they enjoy the comfort of their naked bodies against other pack mates.

Anyway, that's what sent me into tears, and into the bathroom for a kleenex.

We didn't talk anymore about it that night, I washed my face, got to feeling better, then came out of the bathroom tugging at his pants.  We both went to sleep then, curled up in each others arms...  I always am utterly tired when I suffer... emotional distress."

He had friends over, two hardly clad man and a woman, Aubrey, I met her before with I guess who was her boyfriend Lucas?  Though at that time, she was the boyfriend, and Lucas was the girlfriend, cross dressing see.

Anyway, I did not know he had people staying with him now.  How was I suppose to react?  'Oh Kellan, my what pretty young men you have living with you, anyway, how was your day Darling?'  Then, the look.  He saw the bandage on my wrist, and gave me such a look that almost made me want to cry.  I did not do anything with Edward, but the weight of his gaze made me feel dirty, unclean...  We bickered a bit, Aubrey having to leave, and the other two men going into the kitchen to give us 'space', though I know they could hear everything we said...

We smoothed things over in the end, with his saying 'We'll talk about this later'...

He keeps saying that I am demanding him to share all of himself with me, and that he is, but why do I feel so left out at times?  Sometime I get so... I don't know, depressed?  Angry?  It's not just one emotion, but several mixed together to explain how I'm feeling.  On the more darker nights, I've contemplated getting fur just so I can be closer to him, though in the end it's silly, for who knows if we'll be together forever, but for right here and now, it almost seems like a very.. lucid, noncrazy idea.

I know there was a reason his last girlfriend was a shifter...  Kellan is my first boyfriend.  Ever.  I'm trying to be what I can to him, I honestly am... Edward was a vampire, he's a shifter... I.. just don't know.  All I know is that I was on the verge of tears when I was at Kellan's last, and I don't know why.

As for Edward and I...  We were visiting on the night of the full moon, for our loved ones were out doing their pack business... His Cherise, my Kellan...  If I had any other person to turn to for comfort on such nights, I probably would, but alas I don't... I don't go out much, it was a stroke of luck... that I managed to find Kellan.

It was luck.

I need sleep.  So after he fed, and even before, we chatted, and I have an open invitation to come see him whenever I please, though I doubt it will be that often.  He caused my blood to boil with that bite, though I do not think it was my normal act of lust, oh no, I think it was his vampire wiles, but even so, such a thing could be dangerous, and I need not any... impure thoughts about others.

Kellan did not shift for me, and perhaps it was better that way, as in the end, I was nervous, overly so.  I blame his warnings of course, to be naive would have suited this task better, even if it was to be a bit more dangerous.  So, instead of my boyfriend shifting for me, we instead has a nice steak dinner, complete with a baked potato, it was divine, and it was a nice evening overall.

Oh!  I almost forgot.

Edward, he bought me a cross.  Now, I only make note of it here, because, it is indeed, the oddest thing that has ever been done for me.  A vampire.  Giving me cross as a gift.  That, and the cat tree I've been waiting about a month for.  Since Edward and I split apart, I have yet to talk to him recently...

Lily, however, took me shopping.  It was a decent outing, I got a few new outfits, and yes, even a couple of dresses, some, oh la la, lingerie, as she almost forced me into that store.  Kellan will be happy.

So, that's all I've been up to really, haven't seen Kellan in a few days, even though he lives right down the hall from me...  Perhaps I'll go knock on his door for a visit.  Perhaps."

I am no longer Edward's Pomme.  However, it was this time, mutual.  He could not be the Master I wanted, nor could he tame my free spirit.  We both agree it was time to separate ways, for I was nothing but food, and I wanted to be more, nor did he trust me enough to make me anything more...

Trust.

Like he should bloody talk about trust.

On another note, Cherise came to see me at work, she came bearing a gift.  It was a beautiful mask she made by hand, a Siamese Cat, complete with thin, gold wire whiskers...  It was, god it was beautiful.  I have it propped up on my bookshelf, but carefully so as no harm will come to it.

I promised her I'd stop by the store sometime and see her, it was nice to talk to her, she even helped me a bit where Kellan is concerned...

Kellan.

He has promised to shift for me tonight, but we'll be taking precautions.  A bowl of raw meat to curb his hunger from me to it...  He's worried about hurting me, I told him, even if he put me in the hospital, I would not blame him, I'm the one who so wanted to see him shift, and if I get injured or even killed, it's my blame.  I take all the blame.

As I'm no longer Pomme, I feel no reason to get another vampire to sink fang in me, Edward was something special to me, more than the feel you get from the experience... To anyone else, I truly /would/ be food and nothing more.

I awoke, and after merely laying there, inhaling his scent, I began to rouse him, though he was playfully stubborn with such, he is adorable.

So, after we both woke up, we talked once more...

He will shift for me during the new moon I think he said, as he had pack business on the full moon.

I asked him to call me when he got back, and he asked me, even if playful, that I was now going to keep tabs on him and pack business...

I just wanted to know he was alright and safe after that night, I'm human, I worry, especially if he's with a pack of wild animals.

By my own maneuvering in the subject, I not only got him to agree to shift for me, but perhaps to perform... another deed.  We will see what comes of it, and I suppose if I end up in the hospital, dead, or grow fur once a month, I'll get an 'I told you so', from Kellan, and my deepest apologies to him."

By the end of the conversation, my eyes were wet, but I must give myself a pat on the back for not crying... If he only knew how much he hurt me with his words...  I'll tell him, but later, I took all I could at the moment.

He mentioned me being food, or that his 'beast' would probably register me as food, as I'm not pack...  That hurt.  He shoved Edwards words in my face without even knowing it. 

Humans are on the lower rung, I know this.

I told Kellan my greatest fear was him running to a female of his pack, to get from her what I could not give him... He of course said no, and that there were plenty of things I could give him...  Like, a family...  That did not really ease my nerves.

So, we talked as I pressed up against him in the bed under the covers...  I almost had the desire to leave his side for a bit to think, but nay, I wanted to lay beside him far more than seeking solitude.

He seems to hate himself, and I hate myself for bringing up the topic...  The sadness and pain in his eyes, I put that there, and I hate myself for doing such...

I just wanted to let him know I accept him... All of him.

The conversation is not over with, no, we have far more to talk about... But...  I do not look forward to it, especially if the sadness I saw in his eyes today... return every time I talk about his true nature... And to me, it is his /true/ nature... I'm also trying to embrace it.

Would he rather I grow sharp pointy teeth?

If we got serious enough, yeah, I would offer.

If... We got serious enough.

This issue, I pray it does not become an issue...

Once, he drank me in with his gaze...

The second time, I wished to feel his pain and sting of his fangs, he complied.

Kellan... Edward approves of him, for he seems to be a good role in my life... Edward sensed this, I sensed it to, for there was not nearly as much tension between us as there was last time, I hardly had an impure thought about him while he was in my presence...

Again, he has taken me as his Pomme... We'll see if it lasts /this/ time.

After Edward left, I went to Kellan's.

Once we were spent, I said we needed to talk, he feared it was something bad, but I reassured him.  I told him I was to be Edward's Pomme... Yet, I also made Kellan understand, that if he did not approve, then I would tell Edward no... Kellan is first in my life, not Edward, and this I told him, reassuring him...  I was sincere with my man, and in the end, it all worked out.

I could be Edward's Pomme, but he is to no longer feed from my neck, for Kellan does not like to see it riddled with holes... I cannot really blame him, now can I?  I said I would talk to Edward, I don't think he would have a problem acknowledging Kellan's wishes on this subject.

We are going to date exclusively now, just him and I.  Even if I desired another's touch, I will not take it...

How fortunate our two souls met, after both of us suffered such heart break... the knowing comfort we offer each other...

I suppose I shall start this entry off with Edwards visit.  That man has the /biggest/ ego I have ever seen, I tell you what.  Here I was telling him I did'nt want him as a Lover anymore, and he kept going back to 'Well, I can't give you what you want.'  I was ready to slap him, had he not warned me earlier to never disrespect him again.  Daft.  Honestly.  I was beginning to think he was offended that I did'nt want him sexually in my life.  Bah, men.  I think he has real issues letting go, yet he blames me for not letting go?  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  He is a confused man I think, but I will not add to that confusion.

In the end of his meeting, we had come to an agreement which we both thought was best.  I would be his Pomme (If Cherise agrees, for I told Edward I would submit to her desires on this, I don't want her upset).  He will return Sunday and we'll discuss it more.  I am not to feed another vampire, nor be with his enemies physically (which he has none yet, just warning me ahead of time), and I think there's something else, but I forget.  If I break any of these, he'll abandon me, I said fine...  My only request from him, was that he keep our meetings private, he would.

We departed ways with hugs, the meeting overall went pretty well, was rocky in the beginning, but I like to think of myself as a grown up, I did'nt even shed a tear (eyes brimming with tears don't count).

The park.

Later that night, I went to the Golden Gate park was it?  There I found a playground, and with it the child in me came out.  I swung, read from my books, then swung some more...  I swung into the night.  Only at night, did two men come across my path.  The first was Tibbalt, who I knew, the second, I did not, his name was Taylor Neville.

Taylor was a nice enough sort, a freelance writer, decent looking.  He gave me his business card, which I shall add to my growing collection.  

We chatted for about an hour, then Taylor had to go, as I did as well.  Tibbalt, the ever gentleman asked to walk me home, I agreed...  It was when he held my hand, that I about freaked!  He had soon calmed my nerves when I expressed that I hardly knew him and it was too soon.  He laughed, proclaiming he was gay.  I was so relieved, that I then took his hand, and held his own.  He is turning into a good friend, and I told him if I knew any gay men needing a man, I would shoo them his way (that is of course, if his size does not scare them away, he makes me sweat, personally).

After I got home, I went over to Kellan's, a plate of cookies in tow...

His girlfriend packed up, and left town, breaking up with him in her wake...

The poor boy.

I tried my best at consoling him, hugging him tight into my form, I hate when people hurt.  He was very angry, and he almost drove me to tears with some of that anger directed onto me.  My appetite was soon gone.

We talked then, he told me his secret, swearing I would tell no other... I shall not.  I believe Kellan will be a nice distraction for me, and I to him, so we have agreed to date.  We will see how it progresses, as he has Tristan to get over, and I still have Eddie.

"event","Lily came to visit me, I was not utterly surprised that she had come, though it was still pleasant to see her.

I had just gotten off the phone with Edward, he is going away for a few days, I merely told him to be safe while he was on his trip.  He will be, though the nature of my call was for information, which I had gotten, and which I am pleased with.

Time to call Franklin.

But!  Back to Lily.  She asked me how I was doing, concern was there.  I said I was fine, for I am... now.  At least I think I'm fine?  No, I'm fine.  Anyway, as I suspected she came to check up on me... It was the kindest thing she has ever done for me.  Dearest Lily was worried about me, I assured her I was fine.  Not great, but fine.

I asked her about her first love, and if she could remember.  Perhaps I should not have asked her to delve into her own heartache, but I did'nt want this conversation to revolve around Edward and I.  Nay nay nay, shall I bray?

Dearest Lily, her tale was sad, brief, yet sad.  Then.. I asked her about Franklin.

Could he be trusted if I did'nt have my wits about me?  What kind of man was he?  Kind?...  Dearest Lily, she made it sound like I was trying to replace him with Edward, saying it was 'So soon after Edward'...  I corrected her, this was for business, and he would be paid.  

Lily did'nt like this idea... Not at /all/.  She told me that the broken hearted do irrational things...  She was worried.  I tried to tell her this was to simply better my well being, this was not about Edward, and don't worry, I would be careful...

I told Lily that we must part ways, for I had to work soon, she agreed as she had to leave as well.  I mentioned that we still needed that female outing, she said yes, and said perhaps Violet can join us, I thought it was a great idea.

So, Lily left my home, and I went to take a shower.

God I love my loofah.

Though I love my Green Apple shampoo more.  Ha!"

"event","Sleep did'nt come one night, so I decided to go to the Galleria to do a bit of shopping...  I was not alone, for old and young alike were out, and that is when I met Franklin.  Once he flashed a fang at me, I visibly recoiled from his presence... Am I truly still skittish about Vampires?  Yes.

He was kind enough, and offered me to sit and chat with him, I did, and we talked.  He has only recently moved here, a month and a half or so, and he wishes to open an Indian Casino... It's always about the Indians.  We exchanged numbers, a polite gesture, and spoke of many things, though mainly, Love.

I myself did'nt speak much of it, as I try not to whine, but Franklin did.  How I feel for one who chooses eternity to be with a woman, then that eternity fails them...  He does not love (I have heard that before), for it makes life easier to pass through decade to decade.

I myself have seen the ugly side of love.

How I wish to hurt Edward, as he has done so to me...  Yet I will not, I simply can't...  

How cold his departing kiss felt.  There was no warmth for me, nay, it felt like a duty he had to fulfill... I could'nt even bring myself to kiss him back, the feeling was dead, why replace such memories with dead.. unfeeling touches?

It was over, not merely my relationship to him, but our friendship as well... I could feel it, smell it in a way, though I will call him regardless, and ask if I'm to still be his... One of his Pomme's.  Better safe than sorry, for I can't be responsible for another if they decide to feed from me.

Can't vampires alter your mind?  

So much has gone wrong in such a little time, the thought did cross my mind."

Percy: The Tortie the Bastard so adored.

The other two have yet to be named, so I just say 'You', and 'Asshole', they pay attention pretty well I must say.

When I was angry, I came up with three names:  An Bastard Edwards

...I know it should be /A/, but that name is far to short for my precious kitty cat.

I would of course, leave up the way the names were called, to the imagination of others...  I giggled at this, God it felt good.  I feel good.  I shall call Frank and leave a message on his voice mail at his antiques shop, he was a beautiful specimen of the human form...  Though, perhaps a bit too vain for my taste.  I hate vain people.  I am called pretty by some, and I rebuke it.  I am plain, nor vain, just a Jane!

"event","Edward came to visit me, as I knew he would...

I was doing fine, my eyes were dried, my composure kept...

Then he mentioned Love.

And how he did'nt feel it for me.

He said that in a hundred years he had never said the word 'love'...  Though I was quick to tell him he used it so openly and willingly last night...  Oh his Darling Cherise, how she repents for last night...  The moon had her you see, for she's a shifter...  He has known her in a less time than I, yet already he has committed far more to her than I... he even had the nerve to tell me, that he hoped 'in time', he would feel deeper for me...  

The nerve of his, how I wished for the strength to simply cast him from my room, from my home.  He was making me feel lesser and lesser..., but was this his intention?  Or was he blind of how he was hurting me so?

I had told him, that only when he tires of Cherise's bed, shall he come to mine.  Only when she dies, would he love me...  Had he known my feelings he would have said more... More he would have said.  Said more he would have.  Yeah, he could have rejected me sooner than later.

After my tears fled, I asked him if Cherise would mind if he saw me... Already, I spoke of her as if she was above me... Apparently she is.  Edward does not see me as her equal, I have to grow more...  Though she does want to apologize to me, I will let her, later, I can let myself be teary eyed in front of Edward, though I cannot with Cherise.  I can't let her see me weak, for all I know, she can use it against me.  Anyway, he said he did not know, only that she understood...  No, he thinks she understands.

How easy it would be to lie and tell him I felt nothing, that he was no more than a fling...  Just a man.  Perhaps I could of, had I been more prepared for what he threw at me.  And how blind I was not to see it, I suspected, with the cats, that he was to make me not as lonely, for some reason...  I don't know, I'm bloody rambling now.

I am tired of Edward and this pain consuming my journal, I am tired of it all, I have half a mind to cast this in the fire, and watch it die in the flames... Yet I cannot, for it holds good memories, as well as the bad.

I told him I did'nt want him out of my life, for saying anything else would be a lie... He knows when I lie.  Edward said his hesitation comes from ignorance of what I can do, and be. Not from rejection... It is rejection all the same, whether or not he words it differently.

We spoke longer, and in the end, I told him, that even though I loved him, I would settle for being no more than his friend and food, for I could not bare to see him gone from my life, he just can't be gone.  He assured me that was the least I would have... It did'nt console me.

I said he had to go, and to return to me only when he knew what I could and could not be in his life, he left...  He left only after sharing a kiss 'For old times sake,' once more, he crushed my heart, yet he did not know it."

"event","A day has passed since I met Edward with Cherise, and I'm only feeling a little better between that which sleep can offer once it has come and passed...  After I fled from the square, I called Kellan, sobbing, and he met with me at the cliffs.  Such a good friend he is becoming, I wish one day to meet his girlfriend, for she indeed must be something special to have hooked a caring man like himself.

I mostly sobbed while he consoled, though what I did get to speak of...  He said he was sorry, for what more could a man like him really say?  He consoled me, and I barely knew him yet he consoled me.  I had told him, that the thing that hurt most, was that he was trying no doubt to console Cherise, and here I was with an almost damn near stranger who I had only met twice since now...  Kellan did'nt really speak on anything, I can only imagine how it was to hold a wrecked female he hardly knew.

I had clawed my neck, and I was bleeding, he helped me stop the bleeding with kleenex, for I explained to him, that I did'nt want Edward to call me, and even though the bites where long since healed, a primitive part of me wanted that touch of him gone...  I would have to burn my body to be fully freed of his touch, yet I cannot bring myself to howl in flames, so I shall merely suffer.

There is no doubt Edward will come seek me out soon, and perhaps then my tears shall be dried enough to talk to him...  That night, I had a gift I picked up for him, I have been debating about whether or not to give it to him, though I shall...  A departing gift if anything.

How dare he assume I would be alright with so.. just, 'Pandora Cherise, Cherise Pandora'.  What stupidity on his part...  I feel for Cherise, though, not very much, how can I?  She is obviously the better female, the more cherished...  Cherise.. Cherished, not like it does not make sense.

I can't remember if I had told Edward whether or not I minded him being with another... Though even if I had'nt.. such.. Treachery to keep it from me, only to treat it as a light matter...  And Cherise, she was angry as well, but took it out on me, when I tried to walk away from what was happening...  I was'nt going to be intimidated by her, even if she was a beast, literally...  Edward seemed to contain her, and I loathe him for it, I can fight my own battles...  But then, he was probably protecting the other woman, from herself.. Not me from her.

I just do not know, Lily just gazed on with seeming indifference, though I know it can't be true... Can it?  Are vampires really so cold?  I do not know...  All these thoughts and much more kept me awake until about three a.m., I tossed at turned, my thoughts on Edward and Cherise...  And myself.  I called into work today, there were puffy bags under my eyes, and I would rather take a sick day, than explain how horrid I looked, for I did look horrid...  I shall nap in a bit to make up for sleep lost, then perhaps... Get some fresh air.

I suppose I should stop rambling and do something constructive, like paint my walls...  I have been meaning to paint, but the real task shall be to keep my cats away from it.  Heh, the cats.

Perhaps I shall view this as a wake up call to my youth and innocence...  Oh.  Right, what youth and innocence, Edward has stolen them both."

Edward has broken my heart, which had never been broken.

Cherise has been chosen, by a professing of his love to her.

I am shattered, hurt, broken, and I feel lost.

So lost.

I am now.. truly... a cat lady, as there is nothing more in my life, for he has marked her, fed from her, I cannot even relish in being called his only Pomme.

"event","I met a man at the Book Nook today while I was working, his name... Allen Bishop.  He was interested in books about the paranormal, I only had to guess that his interest lies in the Park and the occurrences there.  He wants to cleanse the spirit and put it to rest, my view differed on this, saying that it's its home now, and if people are foolish enough to wander in regardless of the warnings...  Well, their fault.

Allen wanted an assortment of books, many of which we did'nt have on display... So, I told him I would deliver them by hand to the Homeless Shelter, and with such, can look around the place for I mentioned about possibly volunteering there.  He said to feel free, as they always need help.  After he paid for his purchases, he simply left, leaving me to dust once more.

Then, a man came in who was in a wheelchair, handsome enough, though his neck was bandaged, his caretaker(?) that helped him in the store was named Lisa.  He was kind, and it seems he has an interest in Sci-Fi/Horror books.  We chatted a bit, myself asking him what had happened to put him in a wheel chair...

He said he was in a hit and run accident involving a 'Humans First' group...  He had bite marks on his neck, I asked him what they were, even though I knew for there was a bandage on his neck, they had to be bite marks...  He said a friend was helping him out..

Oh God, he was to become a Vampire!

To leave his mortality behind, on a quest to make himself more whole...  I cannot blame him, I would probably do the same thing if it meant I would be able to walk, instead of spending the rest of my life in the wheelchair...  I weep for what warmth he will never have again, I hate to see a mortal turn so willing into a vampire, even I do not long for it.

He wants to be able to stand and hold his woman again, I suppose I can understand that... Love makes us do stupid things.. ignorant things, yet powerful all the same.  I wish him the best of luck in this new life he will lead... And I do hope, it turns out to be all he wanted.

We chatted a bit longer, made introductions... He was nice, and his name turned out to be Marcus Harrington.

Gabriel was the one who has bitten him, and will be turning them, I told Marcus that I knew him, only a little from what Mark told me about him at Moonlight Caress.  At least we fond a piece of common ground.  Apparently he will be given hunting rights at the club... I told him, that when I come of age, perhaps we'll see each other there, he agreed...  Then, he soon left, him and his caretaker leaving my presence."

"event","Another visit from Edward, though at least this time it was'nt at 3:30 in the morning.  However, the conversation was sad, depressing almost.  We spoke of neglect, our duties... Edward has plans, he said a Crossroad is coming up, but would'nt give me any specifics, asking me to be his Lieutenant, 'Lieutenant to what?' I questioned, in which I got not a straight answer..

Yes, I asked him about the Servant position, and his response almost drove me to tears, though I managed to keep composure about myself...  How do you face the truth and not like what you see?  I implored him to stop talking about it, for I could'nt bear to hear what he had to say.  The main point he stressed was that could'nt we get to know each other more?  I said yes of course.. Of course we could.

I pulled away from his touch, I did'nt mean to, but I could'nt help it... Only when he was getting ready to stand, did I stand as well, making to embrace the man, holding him tight.  Only then, did I tell him that it was'nt him I was angry at, but myself...  And also, that I had'nt meant now.  I did'nt want to be a servant now, but I wanted him to know, that I would be interested in such a thing, and to keep the position open for me, lest he thought I did'nt seek it.

We both smiled.  He's adorable when he smiles.  It melts your heart into a puddle of goo for him to mold.  He wanted to stay a bit longer, but I told him and his ways to come back later, when I did'nt have to work in the morning, for I was tired.  He agreed, and with a gentle exchange of emotions, he left me alone with my cats...

The cats I have yet to name.

I do not know why I have been emotional so recently, I used to be a carefree spirit, what is happening to me?  Do I blame Edward for a shift of emotion?  Or does it lie deeper than that?"

I helped myself to a glass of milk to awaken my senses, before we chatted.  He was concerned that he had been neglecting me, I said he was'nt, of course, though I did, just the tiniest bit.  This conversation revolved about this for quite a bit, then, onto a more pleasant one.

Cats.

I had mentioned that we had yet to do kitty shopping for me, and Edward, that Cad!  He summoned I'd say about seven cats to my apartment, they were yowling outside my door!""  I quickly let them in, for fear of them wakening the neighbors, and for a brief moment, a shard of anger flooded threw me...  We were supposed to take a walk in the park to pick them out... I was being foolish. It was almost 4 a.m., he did'nt expect me to be temperamental?  Or perhaps he does'nt understand to me it's the little things that count.

Regardless of that, we choose our cats.

He chose one that had taken refuge on the television, a big ol' fluff ball, I myself, chose the ones that hid under the bed...  I told him, this would give me something to do, a challenge to win their love.  Edward said I had chosen nicely...  He then had to depart, the cats fleeing with him, I myself, had to go get litter and food, as he neglected to bring any over for me.

I still haven't decided on their names, was pondering the ones from the tale of Pandora's Box, but they are too long, and somehow just don't fit... The names will come to me, no sense in forcing them."

I called my family the other night, needing to talk to someone, they want me to come visit them for my birthday, and I might, I do not know, my time is looking free for that day...  I do not even know if I will tell Edward of it, does he even know my real age?  I do not know, I do not ask, for I don't want to scare him away.

Anyway, perhaps I shall take a walk, maybe some fresh air will do me good, I'm bored, but very stir crazy, I do not know, something is pressing in on me, almost a sense of.. an ominous presence.  

I shall go to the park, perhaps tonight, I am willing to touch that tree.

Edward and Lily both said they see promise in me, promise of what?  I work at a bookstore, and nothing more.  Yes, I may be interesting enough to them, but I am not anything special, and I know this...  Why do they not see it?

"event","On Edwards third arrival into my home, he took me to see Lily.

Several emotions passed through me as we took the taxi there.  Would she hate me, would I hate her?  Edward said he created her, brought her into the vampire lifestyle...  Is she.. attached to him, and if so how much?  These were all swimming in my head as we drove there.

Upon arriving, a large man with a shaved head and a mustache opened the door, ushering us in.  I opted to be the strong silent type, for I was nervous, apprehensive, yet.. oddly placid at once.  The man.. Edward called him Berloiz.

We were then escorted down the hallway towards the main room, the sound of a piano and a soprano voice was rising to meet us.  No doubt this was Lily, and already she had two things to hold over me.  Edward, and talented.  As we entered the room, it was'nt Lily who was playing, but a thing man with blond hair, Lily, however, was dancing and singing.

She was... overly enthusiastic upon seeing us, I was weary. She called me the lovely Miss Pandora before offering me food and drink, which I had to then question, 'What is a Riesling?' For she offered that as well.  She was pretty, in the old flapper kind of way, as if she herself had stepped right out of a silent movie.

Having taken water and cheese cake, I then sat down next to Edward, needing his presence at this moment in time, I wonder if he felt it...

The overall meeting was wonderful, and it went better than I thought.  My previous... uncertainty has been lain to rest, for I find Lily adorable, perhaps slightly eccentric, but adorable all the same.  We shared laughs, and out topics of conversation drifted from one subject to another, I think Edward was pleased to see us getting along so well, I enjoyed myself...  Though, was Lily faking this kindness, just to throw me off guard?  I do not want to think so, for she did indeed seem kind, and would'nt mind getting to know her better in due time.

There was also talk of Lily getting back into movies, I can see this, for her personality is strong enough... 

Like all good things, the night had to come to an end, Lily seemed to suck the energy from me, as she's so full of it, and I myself am more laid back in that aspect...  So, I had to leave and get some sleep.  Lily  offered a guest bedroom upstairs, but I declined, I wished for the comfort of my own bed, that which I know.  So, I departed, insisting I walk home a bit then take a cab the rest of the way.

It was truly a wonderful night, and shall give me lots to think upon."

This is my new conquest.  Having grown bored with sitting around my home, I have decided to try my hand at Martial Arts.  I stopped by several places, but the one that truly caught my attention was the River Styx Dojo.. How odd that they name it after the river that flows through the underworld.

It will cost me three hundred dollars a week for me to take Karate and Kali.  The instructor is a Hannibal Black, very serious, though he cusses a bit too much for my taste...  Anywho, lessons start tomorrow, I look forward to it, about time I did something physical, I felt like a cow sitting around and doing nothing...

"event","Ice cream was my own treat for myself today, and it was fabulous.  I simply had a dish of plain chocolate, but I swear it was the best kind I have /ever/ had.

I met a man named Kellan there, for I sat next to him at the counter, the place was packed...  I normally would have opted to sit alone, but I did'nt feel like consuming my food outside, so I huffed it and sat next to a stranger.  He was nice, and has officially named me Panda.

We talked of a few things, though the main topic of conversation seemed to flow around the general cleanliness of people...  This being in regards to where their hands.. mouths, lips, everything has been.  It was a nice chat, though we both soon had to depart.  He kissed my hand (Such a gentleman), and we departed ways.

I simply went home, I've had my excitement for the day, and work was soon to come."

"event","A nude beach, imagine that.  I only thought there were nude beaches in France, but I see they now taint the U.S. as well.  Imagine my shame!  Going there, not knowing what kind of place it was, somehow I obviously looked past all those.. 'Nude Beach!' signs.  So, yes, I was wearing a bathing suit, journal tucked under one arm, blanket under the other.

There I met Frank Jaeger.

Apparently he is an X-Stripper, having lived in New York, stripping there for two years, before taking over the business.  He now moved out here, and does part time appraisal of old artifacts and calligraphic art.  He seemed fascinating... It appears like most the people I have met out here are wonderful.

I spoke to him that I could /never/ strip, however, that I would accept a job as a waitress at the strip club.. getting tips while men lusted after the girls on stage, what is not to like?

Frank teased me, but I did'nt mind, I laughed along when he said: <i>""I could see it now...'Now pay attention everyone. The next dancer is Pandora! Would'nt you like to take a peek at /her/ box?' Of course...you might get paid more, too. Some mythology geek that's piss drunk could pay you to keep your clothes on so he can prevent all those horrible things from being unleashed.""</i>

He's a cad.  But adorable.

Our topic soon took us on the route where I could'nt contain myself and had to ask what he enjoyed, or if he was a Dominant, what he enjoyed doing.  Then, he showed me his true nature...

He was not mortal!  I can only guess he is some kind of werebeast, for he showed me his teeth, and they were very sharp.  He likes to bite, I like to be bitten... Though of course he did'nt bite me, what would Edward think...

What would Edward think?  I need to speak to him.

I apologized for my shock at realizing he was what he was, he did'nt seem too offended.  I asked him for a lock of his hair, in which he commenced to pluck a few strands out, I was amused to the point of where I almost giggled... Almost.

I asked him if he would want to get together and go fetish equipment shopping with me sometime, but merely as friends...  He counteracted (After looking surprised) the he would love to, and perhaps we can try out the stuff together...  We did'nt know whether each one was serious or not, we did'nt ask, spoils the fun.  He gave me his card:

<b>On the front of this business card is his name, number, address, and e-mail, along with the heading ""Calligraphic Designer."" On the back are small sample shots of his brushwork.</b>

Also his hair, a few strands:

<b>Sleek, shiny, and seemingly soft to the touch are the hairs, held in place with a small drop of glue. The strands of hair is a spectacular grayish color. Not the kind of gray one sees in the aged, but more of the gray one sees on the most expensive cars in a lot, a metallic twinge to it, keeping it glossy. It picks up the light at every possible angle.<b/>"

"event","Edward visited me an hour after dusk, as he said he would the previous night.  It was lovely.  We simply laid around and talked, getting to know one another better.  The prodding of me truly wanting this arose, and for a long time, I simply stood there and swore to him that yes it was, and nay, I had no regret...  He seemed pleased in the end.  

Our topics ranged, though mainly it hovered around the Vampires, and of my own curiosity asked him about the becoming of a servant, here I will list what he said, so that I can turn back to it later in life in case I forget.

<i>""A servant is made by four 'marks'. Each mark brings a progressively stronger link between the vampire and his servant. With the first mark the servant becomes stronger physically, gaining some of the vampire's strength. Sometimes with the first mark I've heard that feelings can be shared, even when the two are separated. The second mark gives more direct mind link between the two involved. Also, the servant can 'eat' for the vampire, sustaining him without the need for blood for some time. Perhaps indefinitely. Although this isn't always good for the servant. The third mark gives more physical power, and a true mind link. And with the fourth mark the two are bonded forever together, each able to take power from the other and the two being greater than the sums of the individuals.""</i>

Only one vampire is granted one servant, which I find odd, for I figured that there could be more than one, I was wrong...  Edward, it worries me so about his almost.. blunt refusal to take one on.  Does he really loathe looking after that person so?  Or perhaps he will consider them a weak spot if taken advantage of, only time shall tell.

Lily.  She is not spoken about, perhaps I fear what will be said if I question him about her, for I am sure it's a her now.  A lover?  Mistress?  Daughter?  Or Cat?  It is not that I fear all of those possibilities, but I never have liked to become... a problem.  I do not like to make waves, I prefer the clam blue ocean, compared to the raging sea of turmoil.

Among our conversation we talked about cats as well, Edward and I shall go to a park, so that I may get two.  For two is better than one as I explained to him, the whole companionship thing.  He also asked me about college, and I told him that I planned to study literature, the dying art in my eyes.

No doubt we will see each other in a night time, but after that, I should probably go out bar hopping or some such by myself.. I need to get a life before I grow too attached to him... He is still a vampire, and it won't be healthy if I fall for him, now would it?  Regardless of such, there has'nt been a mans company I have found more intriguing...

But then, I haven't known very man men."

"event","Once more, I took a stroll in a park, but this was an old Indian Reservation or some such, and I, was rock hunting.  I had decided to indeed go with that Orient theme for my apartment, and as such, I was going to get some bamboo to grow.  I wanted to collect my own black pebbles to frame around the plant, and find them I did...  

I also found Edward.

At first I though this man mad, for he appeared to almost be miming an invisible shield around this cherry tree that was planted there... and he was muttering to himself, remind me to get a knife or gun the next time I take a walk in the dark.  He spoke, asking my what I was doing here, in which I replied 'Taking as walk, it is a park yeh know.'  We chit chatted a bit, mainly about the tree, Edward telling me that it was dying and was soon to be dead, it just did'nt know this yet...  What started out as a mainly uneventful evening, turned stark raving mad.

He walked over to a bench nearby, and he touched it.  Such horror!  He was shot up about twelve feet in the air and thrown backwards, crumpling into a heap.  I ran to his side, kneeling in the grass as I tried to rouse him...  He did'nt need rousing, for he shot up into the air, hissing at the tree, his face and hands burned...  He healed most of it after a bit, but his hand was still hurt by the time we left the park.

We walked away from the tree to sit at another bench, and was briefly joined by a cat, I forget it's name, but it was in tribute to some great man, or was it a God?  He spoke of Lily, and her being territorial, but that she was soon to be declawed for she would surely claw me if I entered his(her?) home... Was this a woman he spoke of?  I wanted to ask, but did'nt.  A curious thing though, he said he could call cats to him, amazing...

A desire to feel pain, a masochist.  He questioned me of such feelings, and then asked me if I was willing to open that door... The door that meant 'no' always meant 'yes', and 'mercy' always meant 'more'...  He intrigued me, so much that we left the park and its evil behind us, to venture elsewhere."

"event","I went for a stroll in the park today, a lovely day it was.  The sun was shining bright, kids frolicked while their parents looked on with other parents...  Enjoying the free time they can chat without the constant interruption of their seed bugging them.

I had laid upon the grass, taking in the earthy feel beneath me, and before me, watched a polo match, though I will say that the men playing only added beauty to this sight.  I had my chilling coffee, and my journal, all was peaceful and serene.

A man then interrupted this solitude in my own little world, and I soon found out his name was Mark.  He was very kind, and we chatted for quite a while...  His attitude, was refreshing, for he behaved himself like a true gentleman.  I learned that he owned a BDSM club, it slightly perked my interest as I have yet to go to such an establishment, perhaps on my eighteenth birthday I shall go there to celebrate, though unless I can find someone to supply me with a false ID, I shall only be drinking soda.  I did have some trepidation about the club, he said there was a mixture of races... This made me nervous, as I am yet not fully.. attuned with the others, just mortals.  

<i>Note:  Remind me to speak to Gabriel or Mark when the time rolls around and I am still interested in getting a job there.</i>  
<i>Note 2:  Mark is Dominant, most of the time.</i>

We talked of my bias, and he was very understanding in it, kind.  I haven't been that open with another in a long time.

The chat soon came to an end though, for I had to go to work at the bookstore.  I asked for his phone number, he gave it, though I told him that it was for mere friendship, as I had no desire to, well, basically lust after him.  We laughed about this, for he said that his vampire and Witch would probably wring his neck if he had another woman... I countered that with merely jesting that it would never work out regardless, as to me, they were not mortals.

I still don't know what theme to do my apartment in.. perhaps Chinese/Japanese as I do live in Chinatown."

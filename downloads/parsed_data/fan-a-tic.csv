Well..hmm..it's been quite a bit since I've talked in this little do-hickey..considering. Yah..so what is new...hmm..well lets think. I just got back from Michigan today..wicked trip. And then I worked in the grease pit[A.K.A Mcdonalds]. B-utiful, I know. Aaah man..I just cannot stand some people. Like honestly, god dammit, I'm not retarded, and I'm aware of certain things, you dont have to be breathing down my neck about everything. Like, I'm sorry that youre 27, supporting a family, and you and your husband work at Mcdonalds. Must be rough, but don't take it out on me! I know that may sound bitchy, but hey, the truth hurts. OMG! Why do guys have such big egos? If you got turned down, YOU GOT TURNED NOW! Deal with it! Dont go spreading rumors about people..especially if they aren't even partly true! Like, are you retarded? Can you not soak in information and understand it? You got rejected...that doesnt mean you spread rumors, it means you deal with the truth, and you accept it! Aaah, okay..lol..I need to stop this non-sense..I shall write later."

"event","Ooh dear...okay, so looks like I fucked up any chances I had of getting back with my ex boyfriend. So here it is: when we broke up, he cried, and then turned around the next day and told his friends that he supposedly dumped me&nbsp;and that he just needed a fresh new start and blah &nbsp;blah blah basically acting like I was yesterdays trash. So when his friend told me this, I was shocked, especially knowing that he had in fact cried, and that I dumped HIM! So I told his friend what really happened and blah blah blah and then told him not to tell Emery cause I wasnt tryin to get him mad at me.So turns out Emery finds out that I told Erick, and now, he hates me! He was the only guy that I knew would love me no matter what.&nbsp;The only one I knew wouldnt abandon me, and when I&nbsp;broke up with him, I felt a void. He was the only one I had at that point, and as soon as we broke up, he distanced himself as far away from me as possible.That was one of the most painful times Ive ever experienced..but anyways...enough of this...Im out...later guys"

"event","Okay..hmm whoa! This is my first time writting in this journal. Today was kinda boring..but whatevz, what day isnt? Im real glad my sister and I are starting to get close though. For a while, we really really hated each other, and out of the clear blue, we just started to understand each other. It was strange, cause finally I feel I have someone in my house that understands me completely, and isnt constantly out to judge me. Soo yahhh..hmm..what else is going on with me...well, I still am not sure I want a boyfriend. Guys are so difficult to understand lately. I honestly dont understand whats going on in their minds.Theyre too strange for my liking..but whatevz..looks like Ill have to deal with it. Aaaah Im still pumped about my new job at AE!!! Im so glad Im working there!! Anyways, Ive got nothing good to say...

later days

"event","LSMSA really, REALLY fucks a person up. and i wish that i had been there the last semester. last night i had dreams about some of my seniors, and about a chance to finish out my time there, and all kinds of weirdness. and you know what? when i woke up this morning i felt horribly empty. i worry that that emptiness will follow me the rest of my life. and even though NMT still wanted me afterward, and even though i graduated in the top of my class, the point is that i still didn't graduate with the people that made me who i am. i didn't get to shake Dr. Widhalm's hand, instead i got a hug from linda 'pitbull' pittman. i resent that, you know. i resent a lot of what happened may 16. but i guess that is beside the point. what is the point though? it seems that my life has lost direction since january 13-14. those hours before i left are a blur, and they always will be. i think that is the way i protect myself."

chicago is the shit.
went to this place called the alley, there was this HOT goth/punk guy working there. oh. my. God. he was HOT. and he had purple and black dreads, and bitchin' black pants. he was fuckin wearin a shirt that said ""i <3 Satan"" for goths' sake!! i tipped REALLY well @ his stand, and he was like 'oh that was sweet' and we talked about tippers and i said i was from La. and he said ""aren't we in La. right now??"" it's like, what are you on and where did you find it?
the alley was one of many places @ clark and belmont that i shall visit frequently before my punk 'phase' ends. 
thrifting today was the shit.

so there is SLU, which is somewhat laughable for any respectable giftie. and i feel like people will be laughing at me if i go there, that there will be talk of my failure by all of my rivals and the people in my life that have wounded me...ex-boyfriends, former classmates, etc.


Tech leaves plenty of opportunity to be avoided by people that used to be my friends and that i fear will have outgrown me.


OSU's regional campuses might be fun.

but i am developing relationships here at home that i don't want to necessarily break, you know?"

hehehe. i am wearing my nifty-spifty devil horns. i got them at a garage sale for 10 cents. pretty kick-ass, no?

i am in a pretty damn good mood. 
this is new.
i hope it lasts.
perhaps it is because of the midol-and-effexor cocktail chased with happy tea.
this requires further investigation.

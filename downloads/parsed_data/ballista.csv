"event","I realized I've had the Orange Box for two months and haven't said anything nice here about it. In short: Portal is perfect yet short, while TF2 is fun yet gets a bit repetitive.

Half Life 2 Episode 2 really stands out, though. It's clear that the writers are improving. In fact, Episode 2 probably contains all my favorite scenes in the series. I listed my thoughts on some of my favorites below, in an LJ cut for spoilers.

<lj-cut text=""HL2 Ep2 spoilers!"">
HL2 SPOILER WARNINGGG!!

-The Griggs and Sheckley defense: It really adds something when Valve works to give minor characters personalities, as well as implying what they do when the player isn't around (if you look at the turrets, they have angry shark faces painted on them). This whole scene leads up to its climax very well; just when you think it's over, every warning light turns on, the action music starts up, and Sheckley shouts ""GRAB A TUNNEL!""

-Running across Antlion Sands: This wasn't a really big part, but running along between defensive points with Alyx and the Vortigaunt really had this RPG party feeling to it, what with running along in a mismatched little group of people with vastly different abilities and trying not to die.

-The G-Man vision: ""Doctoor Freeeeeeeemaaaaaaannn...."". This scene is great, IMO; it seems to imply that he's on your side, but that you're just a pawn in something he's doing. And is it just me, or does he sound more desperate, more.. insane? ""When. I. Plucked. Her. From. Black. Mesa... hehe... I acted in the face of... objections, that she was a mere child, and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such nay-sayers when... quelling... them? Hm?... was out of the question.

-The White Forest Inn: There's something neat about seeing a quaint little inn go completely mad when it gets surrounded by soldiers. And then the Hunters start pouring in. Kind of cool to see them in a claustrophobic indoors environment.

-The final battle: After unloading all my best weapons and still being unable to kill all the hunters in time, I turned to get in my car and realized there was one weapon I hadn't tried yet. It's the perfect ending; you can almost see the ""Oh f*ck"" in their vertically-stacked eyes, firing their little explosive knives in vain as you come careening towards them.</lj-cut>"

"event","Sometimes when bored I'll start reading an internet comic, and sometimes they are so good I can't stop reading it and end up staying up until around three in the morning. When I encounter an exceptional comic, I usually get curious and begin poking around trying to find out more about the author. Usually, what I find makes me like the comic less.

I found two very interesting things about Raphael Medina:
- He disapproves of suicide, due to losing a close relative to it.
- He is entering a career in law enforcement (aka a cop).

This is significant because Medina writes a comic called ""Suicide for Hire"" about two highschoolers who start an illegal assisted suicide business. It's dark, witty, and very involved, if a bit too wordy. Spoilers abound below, be warned.

The charm - and there is a shocking amount of it considering the subject matter - really comes from the interaction between the two main characters: Arc and Hunter. While most authors would have no trouble coming up with a dichotomy between cautious Arc and sociopathic Hunter, Medina gives them a surprising amount of depth. While Arc is the one who most often has objections to the ethics of their operation, Hunter is much more consistent in his beliefs. He's homicidal, but he has his limits and strictly abides to a sort of self-created moral structure. Arc, on the other hand, has very malleable ethics and is in constant conflict with this personification of his darker side that takes a sadistic pleasure in murder. In short, they're both completely insane, yet somewhat likable, in their own special ways.

Anyway, the plot. The structure is really nice; after a few mid-story strips showing that this is in no way a story for the weak of heart (or stomach), it starts off at the beginning. Hunter haphazardly states that they could start killing people. Later, Arc, frustrated with hearing a girl angst about her life, sarcastically offers to kill her for ten dollars. Much to his surprise, she agrees. The plot takes off from there as the two establish themselves as an illegal business and encounter every variety of client and problem.

And the suicides... I mean, damn, <i>the suicides.</i> How exactly does someone who's against suicide write two homicidal protagonists? The answer: unnervingly. Hunter, the ""brains"" behind the operation, has a knack for dramatics, appreciation of symbolism, an obsession with seeing the job through. The two start off relatively simple, finishing their first job with a glass of poison, but soon... well, let's just say Hunter has an attitude that if the people are going to die anyway, it doesn't matter what they feel so you might as well make it as symbolic as possible. And the customers to the duo's business... they scream for it to stop, say that they've changed their mind, that it hurts too much and they want to try to improve their life now... the rule of Hunter and Arc's business, though, is that after payment, you can't back out. And sometimes, this means Hunter has to give them a little push (or in one case, when the customer just barely survived, Hunter finished the job with his foot). Hunter's carefree neutrality to it all is horrifying and entertaining at once - at one point he is standing over a burning corpse on a sidewalk and casually declares that he's hungry for breakfast and wants to stop by a Denny's on the way home.

My one criticism is that parts of the comic sound a bit too preachy or political. It seems to balance itself out, though, in an almost creepily even way. Like, a few minutes after utterly disrupting a ""God Hates Fags"" rally (at gunpoint), Hunter beats a homosexual to near-death with a baseball bat. After killing a terminally ill cancer patient, the duo learns that her cancer had miraculously stopped progressing a few days earlier. It can <i>sound</i> preachy, but I guess there's an element of realism to it; it has a very good grasp on the idea that there is more than one side to every story - I guess that's a given, considering it's a story about an assisted suicide company written by someone who is against suicide.

So overall, if you can appreciate things for their originality and writing, I'd recommend giving this a read (I'm not linking it because I like to pretend kids under 18 don't know how to use Google, and it's like a child-proof lock). I'd be warned, though: it is ruthless. This isn't a happy story about some kids who embark on a questionable business venture only to realize it was wrong and turn their lives around. Nor is it a story about senseless violence with no ramifications. It's a very dark, sometimes humorous, and always unnerving story about two kids who kill people for a living.

And it definitely feels like the plot is progressing - albeit slowly - up to an ultimate, conclusive end. But I get the impression it'll either be two gunshots or a ten page list of Assisted Homicide charges."

"event","I heard a song on the radio today...

<i>Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened,
And you close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages?
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow;
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?</i>

At first I was all ""Uhg, politics"", but then I hear this:

<i>I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could
Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and  I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love</i>

I was in complete shock. This was, without doubt, the first time since September 11th I have heard anyone, especially a religious person, openly <i>admit</i> they don't know much about politics. Was this man really talking about <i>coping</i> with disaster without criticizing an ethnic, religious, or political group he knew nothing about? 
I started feeling this odd feeling I'd never felt before, almost as though I thought he actually deserved the right to exist; I think it's what people call ""respect"". 

Good people are an endangered species. I think we should start mass-cloning them."

So, that was supposed to be an animation. I broke up the body parts in a Flash-esque way, but then  noticed it would take forever to do anything with. Animation is hard. I feel like I'm not as fast at it as I used to be, but it could just be that I raised my standards. 

So, I'm thinking about trying to do more with an anime style, where more movement is shown with camera movement and less is shown with character movement. If there's one thing art has taught me, it's that copping out just right looks really good."

"event","First match, too. The duo that beat us ended up getting third place, though (out of around 30 people). I never liked that ""bracket"" system for matches much.

The final match was amazing, though; I've never seen anything so close, nor a video game match as entertaining. They decided ahead of time it would be best 2 out of 3, and all three matches ended 1-on-1 with each player having 1 life left. The final two teams were the aforementioned guy named Adam and a friend of his, playing as Ganondorf and Falco, and two Chris's, playing as Samus and Pikachu. All the matches were fought on that incredibly boring, flat map (the purple zoomy one. I forget its name).

Adam's team was a great <i>team</i>; you could definitely tell they'd practiced working together. Whenever the two of them landed on the edge of the platform Ganondorf would jump in front of Falco and start charging an attack while Falco would shoot (the typical tank-ranged combo people use in MMORPGs). Ganondorf was great at causing chaos and smashing stuff, but the Falco player's reflexes were insane. He was essentially immune to any kind of ranged attack, since he would just blink his  shield on and bounce it away.

The Chrisses, though, were <i>both</i> amazing, on their own. Adam's team obviously had strategies and stuff, but these guys were essentially just good at... not dying, while making the other guys die. They won, presumably since losing a teammate didn't have as big of an impact on them.

I did get to use the whip, though, and got the usual response of ""wow, I didn't know you could do that with the whip!"". Which meant after the matches, everyone had whipfights with Shiek."

In other news, I finished reading Maus and Maus II today. Spoilers below.

Both were very good, though I liked the first one a lot more. In the sequel, the ending took too long to get to and was too abrupt. After they leave Auschwitz the story is pretty much over, but it doesn't end until the final page, where it ends in two panels. It could've at LEAST used some falling action, like showing the funeral, but instead goes straight from Vlad and Anja embracing to a picture of the tombstone. I really wanted Art to reflect on the loss of his father at the end, and maybe to tell what became of the relationship between Vlad and Mala.

The use of animals was interesting, though illogical at times (Maus II starts with Art and his wife arguing about whether she should be a mouse or a frog, since she is French and converted to Judaism, and I'm not sure how the cat-mice near the end fit in), but overall conveys its message quite well. The part where Vlad and Anja are walking down the street, wearing their pig masks, and Anja's tail is dragging behind her is where you really start to get why he chose to use animals.

... the Wikipedia page said he used fish for the British, but I don't remember seeing any (unless it was in the mental hospital place in the first book)."

"event","Someone I've known since around 5th grade was involved in a (possibly fatal) skateboarding accident. From what I heard, he landed on his back and they don't know if he'll live.

I can't say I particularly liked this person. A lot of people didn't. He was always pretty loud, obnoxious... he struck me as a stoner, though I can't say I ever heard anything directly linking him to that crowd. I remember the times when my schoolbus would pass his stop, and I'd breathe a sigh of relief if he wasn't there. I remember sitting next to him on the bus when he discovered kicking the back of the seat made a noise, which he proceeded to do for the rest of the ride.

In my Advanced Graphic Communications class, I was talking to some friends about colleges. This person mentioned he was going to an art school to major in photography. He never struck me as the college type, let alone the artsy type. Heck, I never thought of him as a person.

I think a lot of people didn't. The last person at my school to die had a monument built to honor her, and a big concert to raise funds for the monument. Well, it was originally a monument built to her. Shortly after its construction I read the plaque on it:

""We honor these fallen knights:"" (my school's mascot is a Knight)

And below that, the name ""Gretchen Brandt"" engraved in a glass plaque. I said something to a friend about how creepy this was, that they had a <i>list</i> of dead students. She responded that this last student to die only <i>got</i> a monument because of her popularity. Anyone else might get nothing. This way, at least they'd get a glass plaque on the list and be remembered.

I didn't get how true that was until now. Yesterday I called a friend to RSVP to a party invitation since I didn't see him in school for the last few days (he was away at a camp).
""Did anything happen while I was gone?"" he asked.
""Chris had an accident. They think he might die.""
""Oh.. I guess he can't make it to the party. Hah.""

I mentioned it to another friend while waiting to leave school that day.

""Did you hear about Chris?""
""What about him?""
""He had an accident. They said he might not make it, or go into a coma.""
""Oh. Huh.""

When Gretchen died, <a href=""http://ballista.livejournal.com/9149.html"">the school was in mourning</a>. If Chris dies, they might not even announce it over the PA system. People might not notice, or care. Or worse, they might notice and be happy about it. I only heard about his accident because his cousin occasionally stops by my Graphic Communications class to chat with a friend, and one day she was near-tears and told the teacher.

I hope Chris doesn't die. I hope he doesn't get permanent brain damage or anything either. I hope he's better in time for graduation. I hope he becomes a photographer. And I feel bad for never seeing him as a person until a week ago. 

He deserves more than a glass plaque. He deserves his own waterfall monument. Everyone deserves their own waterfall monument, even if they aren't dead. Chris wouldn't get a waterfall becuse he wasn't as widely loved as Gretchen was. And when we say someone is unloved, we say it like it's their fault and not ours. That's a mistake.

We need to fix it.

And pray for Chris, please. Even the athiests.






... In lighter news, I'm evidently entering a Super Smash Brothers Melee 2 vs 2 tournament this upcoming Friday. A friend of mine needed a partner to enter, so he has taken it upon himself to TRAIN me into the perfect winning machine. Or at least enough that I don't get in his way.

There is a kid named Adam who always wins. He also plays as Ganondorf, which makes him more intimidating than if he was Kirby or something. But since he looks evil and always wins, this also makes him the badguy and means he's inevitably going to be defeated by the least likely contenders, which is my friend and I. Especially if we go with Sheik-Samus like we're thinking. We're like Team Mulan.

I hate video game controllers. They're too... squishy, compared to a keyboard or mouse. And the buttons are all the heck over the place.

EDIT: Determined why this is. Practically every button, if not every button, is pressure sensitive. So not only do buttons not do what you want if you don't press them hard enough, but they do something <i>different.</i>"

The colors here looked better on my old monitor. And printed. The lines I left black didn't stand out as much.

Anyway, a bit more background on this. I had already been working on one graphic novel type thing for a few months. It had a robot dragon, but it was pretty long and deep and wordy and stuff, and didn't work well in 12 pages. So one day in class, about a month or so before the project was due, I declared ""screw this, I'm going to make a comic about cartoon birds. And they aren't going to talk at all."" I drew four pages over the weekend, emailed them to the teacher. He loved them and I got permission to change.

But first, some spoiler space because this ruins Eragon, both the movie and the book.

SPOILARS








1.) <b>Brom was replaced by Dr. House</b>
<img src=""http://www.foxmage.com/Discrep1.jpg"">
I noticed something was different about Brom. He wasn't the mysterious, wise storyteller of the book. In fact, he was kind of a dick, who staggered around grunting insults at people and occasionally kicking their ass. Then it hit me: Brom was <i>House</i>. If House had a sword and magic powers, he and Brom would be identical.

2.) <b>The Ra'zac were replaced by The Mummy</b>
This is the only thing the movie has going for it. In the book, the Ra'zac were these really fast insectoid assassins. In the movie, they were decaying zombies with a plague of locusts constantly surrounding them. Plague of locusts wins over exoskeleton any day.

3.) <b>Saphira's childhood was replaced by a cloud.</b>
When Violet said Saphira flies into the sun and gains three level ups, I thought he meant that there was the implied passage of time. Like, with baby Saphira flying into the sun, and then coming back down fully grown, implying she had been living with Eragon for weeks.
No.
She actually flies into a cloud, there is a series of three fiery explosions, and she is fully grown. And then she lands and says ""Hi my name is Saphira. I am telepathic. You are my rider."" This is not a joke.


4.) <b>The Urgals were replaced by bikers.</b>
<img src=""http://www.foxmage.com/Discrep4.jpg"">
Well, okay, they didn't have motorcycles. But still.

5.) <b>Terim was replaced by a dock.</b>
<img src=""http://www.foxmage.com/Discrep5.jpg"">
I'm quite sure in the book it was a massive, towering citadel surrounded by mansions. Maybe I misread.

6.) <b>The king was replaced by the G-Man</b>
<i>We will de-stroy Eragon before he. Knows what hithim.</i>
The king never even appeared in the book, so I don't know. Maybe he does have a speech impediment.

7.) <b>The plot was replaced with Brom's death sequence.</b>
Someone watching the movie might notice the ending seems a bit... rushed. In fact, everything seems a bit rushed. Except for one part: Brom's death sequence. After becoming mortally wounded, Brom takes like half an hour to die. And what was that whole thing with taking a harpoon for Eragon and dying while flying on a dragon? In the book he died in a cave from a fever after trying to recover from being ambushed.
And what was with that whole speech about how he doomed the dragons when he killed off one of the last two? Reality check: they were both male. You didn't doom the dragons because you killed the second-to-last dragon, you doomed the dragons because you let your dragon, who was the last female, die.

8.) <b>All themes were replaced by standard-issue movie themes.</b>
There are none too subtle motifs regarding the importance of family. Way to pull a Wonka.

9.) <b>The ending battle was replaced by Saphira setting everyone on fire.</b>
For a moment, they looked even more screwed than in the book. Not only were the Urgals attacking, but so were the king's men. Then, when all hope seems lost... Saphira sets everyone on fire. I mean <i>everyone</i>. The urgals, being bikers, don't take much notice, though the HP drain from the [on fiah!] status effect definitely helped turn the tide of the battle.

10.) <b>Durza was a pussy.</b>
This one might confuse people that saw the movie but didn't read the book. In the movie, Durza could teleport around and set things on fire with his mind. He could also summon an invincible ghost dragon and fiery sword of doom. 
But that was precisely his problem. The book Durza didn't need any sword or dragon or teleportation. He <i>walked</i> everywhere. And he killed people by <i>looking at them really hard</i>.

11.) <b>Eragon was made mildly competent.</b>
This difference really stands out; in the book, Eragon was getting horribly wounded every six pages and spent about half the book unconscious from being whacked over the head, using too much magic, or, in one instance, flying too high (I found the scene where he and Saphira ponder how come there is no air high up rather cute, and was sad it got cut). The movie Eragon had survival instincts. He could actually swordfight, too, and managed to pick up that Brom was a Dragon Rider without having the old man spell it out for him. The problem? <i>Heroes can't be competent.</i> Might as well have just given him a machine gun and had him level every city known to Alagaesia.

12.) <b>The scene where Eragon and Brom get wasted was removed.</b>
I'm not quite sure why, in the book, they rode into a town and drank their bodyweight, but I was disappointed it got cut.

13.) <b>Any opposition was removed.</b>
In the book Eragon feared for his life. He had to swing a huge radius around practically every town and, whenever he made his hasty escape on Saphira, had to spend the next day pulling arrows out of her. In the movie, anything that got within ten feet of them only lived if Eragon <i>decided</i> it lived. I think killing the Ra'zac in one hit threw off the levelling curve and gave them way too much EXP way too early in the game.

14.) <b>Saphira died a Disney Death.</b>
Brom and Eragon have a conversation in the book about how using magic drains an equal amount of energy from the user. Not in the movie, evidently. Well, Saphira might not have been <i>dead</i>, but she did have a bunch of cannonball-sized holes in her neck.
Eragon casts his little healing spell, fails, and falls unconscious. Murtagh wakes him up, is like ""Some friends can never be replaced"". Then Saphira flies down! I half expected Murtagh to be like ""Just kidding! I found a replacement!"", but it turns out the healing spell <i>did</i> work! Yay for Disney. I mean Eragon.

15.) <b>Murtagh was removed.</b>
Yes, I know there was a character named Murtagh in the movie (though I just realized they never actually <i>said</i> his name once). But in the book, Murtagh was like the co-main character. He was Eragon's angsty, mysterious foil. Critics have claimed he was one of the most developed chracters.
In the movie... eh, Violet's claim that the movie wouldn't've been any different without Murtagh was an understatement. He was half removed, half turned into comic relief. Maybe by accident. Don't let his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Murtagh.png"">badass cape, emo hair, and ""I'm the main character's angsty, grim, down-to-earth foil!"" look</a> fool you, he spends the whole movie smiling, laughing, and stalking Eragon.
... Just so anyone that didn't read the book knows, book Murtagh is amazing. While Eragon's all like ""we need to save everybody!"" Murtagh is taking people prisoner and then chopping their heads off so he doesn't have to worry about them escaping. 

16.) <b>Arya's shirt never came off.</b>
I mean, sure, there's a lot of differences with Arya. In the movie she's not an elf, not in a coma, not been tortured to the brink of death, not a developed character, etc; but I definitely think this is the biggest difference. The scene where Eragon is trying very hard to be G-rated while healing the scars all over unconscious Arya's body would've been really cute, and helped establish his feelings towards Arya as lust rather than love (his attraction to her in the book is based purely on her looks).

17 and final.) <b>The coolest looking scene in the book was removed.</b>
There is an epic struggle in the depths of a huge mountain in the base of a volcano several miles high; Eragon breaks into Durza's mind but is struck by a crippling flow of memories from Durza's troubled childhood. The memories slowly overpower Eragon, as Durza strides forward for the kill. Suddenly, the giant crystal ceiling shatters, and Saphira bursts down, breathing a jet of flame, Arya on her back. As the deadly shards of crystal fall towards the battle below, Eragon rushes forward and, with his last bit of energy, plagued by the Shade's troubled memories, plunges his sword through Durza's heart.
Yeah, in the movie he kicks Durza off a dragon then stabs him.


So, in conclusion: I should criticize ALL movie scripts before they are put into production. The world would be a better place."

"event","As an animator it's my job to see all animated movies that don't look like crap. I love having an excuse to watch cartoons.


So, first off is Happy Feet. It was pretty good and very pretty. I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie, given two things I discovered when I first learned 3D animation: dance sequences are the easiest thing to make and penguins are the easiest things to model. Despite this, the visuals and audio were beautifully done, and character interaction was charming. There was something a bit wrong with the plot, though; one of the Rotten Tomatoes reviewers hit the nail on the head with ""even the wee ones may start to notice something's amiss when the movie's theme goes from 'be yourself' to 'we must regulate the overfishing of the Antarctic oceans'."" There's a definite, slow tone change, stemming from the fact that it's trying to incorporate two incredibly diverse, unrelated themes at once. ""Be yourself to save the ecosystem"" doesn't really work as a theme.

Flushed Away. Yay, Aardman went 3D! It's nice seeing his style done 100 times faster and easier. The story itself is nothing spectacular, but well executed. The animation is simplistic, but, well, very animated. Aardman gives life and personality to the characters without any special effects (compare to, say, the soulless machines and attempted realism of The Spirits Within). As said, the plot is well structured; I especially liked the scene where main character keeps saying ""goodnight"" just to hear the girl respond.

So, of the two, I say Happy Feet was better just because it was so amazingly pretty, though it has definite structure flaws."

Usually I wouldn't make fun of someone's views or drawing abilities, but:

2.) He doesn't actually listen to other people's views. Thinking you're right is one thing, refusing to believe you are wrong is another.

3.) I never actually made fun of his views or drawing abilities, but just drew two circles. Hypocrisy is so much fun."

"event","I know I talk about webcomics too much already, but I had to bring this up...

So, anyone that reads The Dreamland Chronicles (http://www.thedreamlandchronicles.com/) has probably speculated ""hey, I bet king Nicodemus is that dragon from the beginning"". Except the king talks in blue speech bubbles and doesn't seem to recognize Alex at all.

Well, he didn't seem to, anyway.

As soon as Nicodemus was shown, the author went back, recolored the speech bubbles, and actually reworded dialogue to fit that. Now he talks in red bubbles from his first dialogue, and makes references to seeing Alex in the tomb years earlier.

The author essentially admitted this was evil, but not worthy of apology. His support was that people reading the comic as he released it would have a whole day to make the connection between Nick and the dragon, while people reading the archives or print version would have a minute at most. It was a much better surprise seeing the dragon all of a sudden, yes, but modifying the archives seems downright evil. Personally, I think the text bubbles should've started white (or maybe just red with no yellow) and slowly faded to red/yellow during that page where  Nicodemus slowly comes into view while confronting Alex about the sword.

It's just no fun knowing that things you've already read can change at any moment."

Also, RH Junior's livejournal infuriates me. Partly because of his ""I'm right and you are a poopy head!"" attitude, and partly because I'm blocked so I can't respond to any of his points. Though at this point, I would probably just skip the responding and straight out ask him if ever completed high school. Not as an insult, but because I'm curious. It'd feel a lot better if he said no, in the same manner that you feel better if a baby is gnawing on your hand than an if an adult was.

-AP Spanish
-AP Studio Art
-Honors Precalculus (I got a bit behind in math when I took nothing besides Trig last year. All my friends are in AP Calc)

Or it could've just been that it had all the aspects I like in characters (which includes, but is not limited to: wizards, random runic markings on body or accessories, three fingered hands, and very expressive bodies). But in all honesty, I thought the art was very good. With an expert in color or lighting, it could've been amazing. So as I see it, Ant Bully was one of those movies that was good, but could've been amazing with very little work.

Snakes on a Plane, on the other hand? Motherf*cking awsome. It might not be the best movie ever, but it succeeds at its chosen genre of action packed tongue-in-cheek horror with flying colors. One of the best parts was the audience enthusiasm. As in, when Samuel L Jackson yells ""I have HAD IT with these MOTHERF=)CKING SNAKES"" everyone cheers.

Yeah, Blizzard made some elaborate story about how the WC3 Draenei ""de-evolved"" from the giant blue draenei, but seriously; they just needed a race that looked cool enough to counter the Horde's Blood Elves.

"event","So, in Tales of the Questor, Quentyn explains that he has never seen the horizon before due to the ""Mistwall"" that surrounds the racconan lands. This is an interesting plot element, emphasizing the mystery behind his new expedition. However, the problem I have with this is that, despite being a huge wall of clouds that surrounds everything, I'm pretty sure this is the first time the Mistwall has actually been pictured.

Establishing shots, as they're called in movies, are often overlooked in online comics. People often forget that the setting is what ties the characters and plot elements together. This works fine for comics like Penny Arcade, where the focus is usually on two characters holding a conversation and having very little interaction with their environment. But when the environment is involved, it's important to give a general idea of where everything is. 

Megatokyo, for instance, fails at this terribly. The strips tend to be full-panel images of the characters with some random buildings and people in the background. Look at <a href=""http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=826"">this</a> strip, for example. Ping is supposed to be pulling the girl into an alcove. Were there no text, however, you would have no idea where they were going. To flow smoothly, the alcove would needed to have been pictured in at least one of the previous panels and again in the last panel. Megatokyo hardly uses the art at all to tell the story, and I'll probably rant about that some other day.

In a way, the establishing shot is often a kind of foreshadowing. The alcove appearing before Ping pulls the girl into it would have made the story seem more ""real"" to the reader. As is, the alcove is a kind of Dues Ex Machina presence. The establishing shot rarely needs to be complex for this purpose. For instance, back in <a href=""http://npc.comicgenesis.com/d/20030112.html"">Tales of the Questor</a>, the basics positioning of the raft and the big lizard guy is expressed in the first panel. This is enough for it to make sense when <a href=""http://npc.comicgenesis.com/d/20030202.html"">Quentyn lunges at the girl</a> two strips later.

That's not to say the establishing shot has to be one image. The backgrounds in Girl Genius are amazing, and it often takes multiple strips to outline them entirely. But a general consistent image that helps further the story is given. In the bridge scene, several strips are used to show the <a href=""http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/cgi-bin/ggmain.cgi?date=20050627"">open space around the bridge</a>, <a href=""http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/cgi-bin/ggmain.cgi?date=20050701"">the size of the bridge</a>, and ultimately the <a href=""http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/cgi-bin/ggmain.cgi?date=20050711"">underside of the bridge.</a> While never shown in its entirety, enough of the bridge is shown to properly model it in your mind. The fact that it won't fit in one camera angle even magnifies its size, passing it as an entire background area rather than a background object.

So... I forget why I was writing this. In conclusion, the Mistwall really should have appeared earlier. It seems that if the location of the story is small enough that no horizons are visible, the Mist wall would appear quite frequently."

"event","while last nigth was awesome...this tended to be a bitch of a night! i had to say my goodbyes to people that in reality i know that i will never see again! it was hard! i hope in december i see alot of them again! well i was with sarah! and she is my best girlfriend (her and amy) and everything was fine til i had to leave. amy started crying everyone was hugging me and i lost it! oh boy! the worst was saying bye to sarah (even tho she is unofficialling) we both were bawling! like no joke!! it was just terrible. she is sucha great girl!! and i will miss her but i know we will stay ijn touch also! my best guy friend came over to say bye and i only gave him 2 minutes cuz i told him that if i spent more time with him i would cry more and god knows i dont wanna do any more of that!! so i told him that i loved him soo much but i know for sure i will see him! we are too good of friends to just stop talkin yah know? well i wrote him this loooong email and i sent it too him syaing everything i wanted to say but couldnt!

well then came to part of sayin bye to the ex...he was not at the party that i was at so i called him and he said he didnt wanna see me to say bye. so i hung up and started bawling! then he texted me and said sorry and he really needed to see me and tlak to me! so we met up and he told me he couldnt say goodbye to me again and thta it was too hard. he didnt talk to me much at all this week and he explained that it was too hard and he thought that if we distanced ourselves than it would be easier....didnt work! but he told me how much he cares....etc. and all that kinda shit! that really made me feel so much better. i didnt cry. i know we will stay in touch! we spent too much of highschool (3 yrs) goin back and fourth and no matter how much we fight we really care about eachother. so that was a positive. except he found out i kissed another guy last nigth and he said he was so pissed he wanted to kill the kid (oh geez!!) and he is at a party with him right now..... anyways! enough!!
 
those 3 people (outta my non soccr friends) are the ones ill stay close to! and im not worried! i love you all!! my team...you are all amazing people! we will all be great!! dont hold back! take chances!  well i gotta get up in 3 hours...wish me luck on that shit...early flight grrr! jason leaves tomorrow too...i thnk we will stay friends also...and greenie is spending thanksgiving with me (i think) but enough of the sad shit!! x's and o's! everyone be safe and good luck!! stay updating in here!!!! 
love you all like sisters!!!!!

i realized that some people i will never see again. i mean people talk all time and say how they will see eachother over breaks and everything will just be the same. but in all reality it just wont. people are going to change completely. some of us might not even be moving back. everything is just so real to me now.

i dont think i can imagine what i would have done without my team. you guys are so awesome! every one of you has so many different qualities. i know you will all be great  in college, and it is gonna be hard to bond with another team the way we all did! our senior year we all came together soo well! i am so proud of every one of you and all our individual and team accomplishments. we are awesome and don't ever forget that!

we are gonna meet so many new people, but we can't forget our old friends  because they helped to mold us into the people we are today. every single one of you has taught me so much and are so awesome in different ways!!

*amanda- you are so strong as a person! and you had such a good season...you will do great in college!!
*melissa-you were new and that is hard, believe i know, but you did well to deal with that!
*april- god! i wish i could run liek  you. you are soo smart and a great player! i wish i was as disciplined as you!
*shaylyn- we started to get so much closer this summer! i wish we could chill more!! so many inside jokes! i luv yah girl! you are awesome!
*paige- you like april are so disciplined, and you are such a graet leader!

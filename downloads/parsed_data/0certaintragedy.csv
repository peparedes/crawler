"event","There's this transvestite man who comes into work a few time a week and he really got me thinking about somethings. Bare with me, please.

At first I selfishly wondered what he thought of me, like if he looks at me and thinks that I take the fact that I'm a woman for granted, I'm sloppy and clumbsy, but honestly I doubt he thinks about it. Then I wondered which bathroom he would use in public, not in mean way, but a curious way, because either one he choses, people are going to look at him funny and this is when I had my enlightenment. All these people in this place have passed some sort of judgment on this person, whether it was about his sexual orientation, his up bringing, or his character. It really frustrated me, because he is a sweet person, polite and soft spoken. Maybe he does have some sort of ""choice"" in how he dresses, but really, something inside of him calls him to be this person. He is brave for acknowledging that voice. If more people stood up and took credit for who they actually were, maybe this would be a better place. It's so frustrating because so many people stuff down who they really are to appease everyone around them and why? Really, why? I don't get it. Why sacrifice yourself for what a bunch of judgmental [and this case close minded catholic suburbinites] think. At the end of the day, we are who we are, whether we like it or not, so why not embrace it, dress like a woman, a man, a child, whatever, create an open forum for uniqueness and reject all these frustrating social standards. I just don't think that this person would make a conscious choice to be looked at like that and welcome that sort of (really unjustified) disgust, i don't think someone would willingly choose that lifestyle... 

what i really have come to realize is that i have to move the hell out of Colerain township..."

"event","October has been an excellent month for CDs, let me review for those who have been living under a rock (or in iraq lolz).<br /><br /><b>+ Spill Canvas </b>""No Really, I'm Fine""- nothing extremely special, but still a solid release. I was addicted to it for a good two weeks. i'm pretty excited about see them live.<br /><b><br /></b><b>+ Armor for Sleep</b> ""Smile for Them""- Again this release is mature, but nothing too special. If you enjoyed their other releases, you'll like this. I really think this band is consistent, but I'd prefer they stuck with previous themes, this real life stuff doesn't always work for them.<br /> <b><br /></b><b>+ BRAND NEW </b>""(fork &amp; knife)""- this song can be found on amazon and itunes. it is a beautiful song.&nbsp; check it out. brand new is simply an amazing and evolving band.<br /><b><br /> </b><b>+ Coheed and Cambria</b> ""No World for Tomorrow""- I grew up with this band, so of course something about them is always going to get to me. They remind me so much of just discovering music and what it can be. They also are very consistent and I can listen to all of their albums and find certain riffs and lyrics remarkable, too bad they cannot live up to it live. <br />  <b><br />+ Crime in Stereo </b>""is dead""- I never really put Brand New and CIS in the same ballpark, but this album brings crime in stereo to a new and refreshing level. It is nothing like I expected, but still can listen to it on repeat. I love [nearly] every song.<br /><br /><b>+ Dashboard Confessional</b> ""The Shade of Poison Trees""- go ahead and roll your eyes, but this is exactly what Carraba should have been doing all along. These songs are well-crafted and soothing. I love driving home at night with this album playing.<br /><b><br />+ Jimmy Eat World</b> ""Chase this Light""- I love this band. They are so dependable and I shouldn't even have to write that this CD is wonderful and perfect of the fall. Jimmy Eat World could most likely release a great album every month. They are that good. Buy this, like right now.<br /> <br /><b>+Saves the Day</b> ""Under the Boards""- If you weren't into ""Sound the Alarm"", the bottom line is that you won't like this album. I admit I am a bit confused about what they were going for on a few songs, but overall I like this album and will eventually buy it. <br /> <b><br />+ Say Anything</b> ""In Defense of a Genre""- Nothing extremely special about this two disc release, but it is still solid and the lyrics are always entertaining. I like it enough.<br /><br /><b>+Thrice</b> ""Alchemy Index Vol I &amp; II""- Dustin Kensrue is a genius and i think by the end of this index he will have a masterpiece, Thrice is a lot more talented than they get credit for. They really do have so much range and if you aren't into heavier side (Vol 1 Fire), Vol II (water) is really mellow and refreshing (lolcatz).<br /><br /><b>= A Wilhelm Scream</b> ""Career Suicide""- I swear they recycled some riffs from ""Ruiner"", but still a decent CD. I could get into it...<br /><br /><b>- Emery</b> ""I am only a man""- Weak, over produced and lacks all the emotion i loved from these guys, don't waste your time even downloading it or stealing it. <br /><br />Releases I'm not bothering with:<br /><strike>Thursday ""Kill the House Lights""<br />Taking Back Sunday ""Notes From the Past""</strike><br /><br />[i called in sick to work today and i skipped all of my classes, so yeah, i am bored and a mess]"

it is also the first time in four years that i didn't attend cincinnati's warped tour. i just wasn't into it.

i was driving home from school today and decided to listen to A Call to Arms.
boy do i miss that band. It was so much fun&nbsp;driving 45 mins to listen to Ryan play.
you could just tell on stage that he loved what he was doing and who he was with,
sadly i haven't seen that in him since they broke up. i wish he could find to take pride in.
they sure did write some amazing music, even if their vocalists always had issues.

i found out today that the gas station near my house (my dad calls it the ""indian reservation"")
sells slush puppies now! I'm really excited, but I'm not allowed to go there alone, seriously.


other than that Harry Potter consumes my life and i messed up my car. so yeah, that rules."

"event","jesse's surprise birthday went sweet. i love sausage fests!
we scared the crap out of him and he looked like he wanted to fight us all.
but i think he liked it, he said no one has ever done anything like that for him.
the UFC fights were a little boring and some people didn't pay&nbsp;but it's whatever.

yesterday ruled the world. ryan, brian and i went puttputting after church,
swam for a while, got free food and met up with Jason, Jake and Jesse&nbsp;
to see Ratatouille! which was hilarious and really freaking cute.

today i made 20 bucks at work, which sucked because this week is nuts.
tuesday night = harry potter movie!
wesday night = not going to rise against anymore.
thursday = first day of class. boo.
friday = trip to c-bus to shop.
saturday = THE POLICE in louisville.

too much money, not enough working.&nbsp;

now it's time to clean, my parents come home tonight."

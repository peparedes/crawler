"event","thanksgiving this year was wonderful, as it always is. family plus a lot of food equals a happy sherri. we're in the run up to christmas now and i'm excited. i love this time of year and i know almost everybody says that, but really, it's true. i love having an excuse to listen to christmas music and to wrap up in clothes that don't really match, but they're warm so i'll wear them anyway. i love being in a shop and spotting something that would be just perfect as a present and hiding it away until christmas eve, when i wrap all my gifts for people. christmas eve is my favorite day of all. i sleep in and then spend as much of the day in my pajamas as i can, sat on my bedroom floor listening to carols and wrapping presents, shooing away the occasional family member that comes to look. it's a quiet day for me and a nice respite before the madness of christmas day itself. talking about this is encouraging a nagging voice in the back of my head that keeps reminding me that i haven't actually done much about shopping, so i think i'll stop now. expect some more christmas tales courtesy of yours truly in the next few weeks.

i need to work on writing longer entries, but i always seem to run out of steam after a little while. i'll get better, i promise."

"event","look, i've made it to my second entry. who'd have guessed i would? i seem to have a knack of writing one post and then dying off. i promise i won't do that this time, i'll stick around, if only because i'm a little scared of stacy kicking my butt. so sorry, you're all stuck with me. even if i'm still not official. 

i've been reading over other people's entries, scouting out inspiration and entertainment and i'm a little more than intimidated now. some people are so wonderfully eloquent and write the most enthralling entries, even if they're only talking about how they got up in the morning and made a cup of coffee. either that or they're hysterically funny. i'm terrified of trying to live up to that. i know i shouldn't be, i should be all I'M HERE, I'M ME, LIKE IT OR LUMP IT. but i just can't bring myself to act like that. i like being liked and i want to live up to what i imagine to be other people's expectations, even if they don't actually have any. i guess i'm just a little paranoid."

"event","okay, so yes i am a clone right now. :( but i figure i only have a week until i become (hopefully) official. i think i will cry if i remain a clone, that would be really sad. 

i'm the worst at knowing how to start something like this. i want to launch into little stories about my day or my friends and family. i want to write everything down because it makes me laugh or sometimes cry. or i just want to talk about how i just cut my finger and it sort of stings now. little things, the sort of things i'll have forgotten about in five, ten, fifty years time. but i'll save all that for a another time when i'm not trying to make a good impression. 

for now though, do i introduce myself? i could, but if you're here i'd hope you already knew who i was. if not: sherri dupree and i'm in a band called eisley. you should look us up, we're sort of cute."

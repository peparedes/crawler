<b>THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!</b>
This journal no longer updates except in communities.  I've moved to a new one.  If you were on my list here and got removed without being told where to find my new one, then OH SNAP!  YOU MUST HAVE FUCKED UP HARDCORE.  Or else you don't even use LJ anymore and I didn't think it was worth it to tell you.

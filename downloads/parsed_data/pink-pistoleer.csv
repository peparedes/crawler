everyoone is gay

anyhow, nirvana sucks

im not in the mood for anything, im pretty much a walking drunken fuck-mess, im not in the mood for romance and everyone is ugly, or maybe it's just that i have built up walls the size of jericho's defences. for the past couple of days i have done things that i regret deeply and i wanna stay away from any more confussion, it's not hard, i just roll with the hype, i guess thinking is killing time and killing time is wasting away my inner consious, huh?"

if it isnt to make ourselves happy? there are sooo many things that can be oferred to the exchange of nothing, it's silly! i mean we all have our expectations of what someone will be like and we dream...
but are we really waiting for that? are we easy targets to people that pay full price for a rat bat hotels?
im not easy! yet im not that hard, i peel away like early morning sickness
we are kings amongst runaways

"event","people everywhere are celebrating their love, couples laugh joyfully as they share their big macs and biggie fries and im here building me a pizza.
 why is this day such a drag for me always, i guess is just the realization that there is an empty void in my life and there has always been one, even though at times i felt myself fullfilled, it was all as real as a flying midget or bullshit to put it in perspective. i have always been empty inside of that certain person and i just for some wierd reason think that i would never get over it. i pass more time analyzing what went wrong in my past relationships than trying to find one. i masturbate until my penis is red and i lost my craving for sexual interaction, now there is the problem. i feel that can never compromise shit, i like my pizza with basil and garlic that's it! that's what im having. i want it my way i don't wanna put myself in the back seat of an oldsmobile and go along for a dreary ride downtown. relationships suck!!! more than kirby does!
so today i sit twirling my uncurly hair. thinking about how great it would be to walk hand in hand to our favorite restaurant, smiling big time! with hearts in our looks and love in our speech. sharing a strawberry shortcake (our favorite) later walking down our own little secret spot at our favorite local beach to later lay on the hammock on top of eachother while looking at the stars and repeating over and over the words i have yet to hear ( ilove you, so much) sex that night would be great, our bodies would melt in the heat of SLOW copulation during the long long night. in the morning we would wake up and with a smile remember why we did everything we did last night, i'll bring you breakfast in bed whatever you want. weeks later our schedules will be full and we will always be on a rush and even though will be living in the same house we will never really have time for a real conversation, you'll tell your mother and your friends that i don't appreciate you and i'll long for the day you can trust me, you will then tell me that you never really liked garlic and that basil gives you a heart-burn and that my red jacket looks way too faded. you'll stop cooking and spend more time with your friends and suddenly we have fallen apart, but we will still tell eachother that we love us, because we know that when valentines day comes we can sex again, until it becomes rutine and then you run away with that cute spanish lad from sweden. then i would loose faith in love and companionship and i'll spend the rest of my life in west hollywood herrasing boys and paying them for blow jobs, then one day i'll put a bullet through my head. then you send me a post card. love sean from dublin (it's cold down here) :) visit me soon!"

"event","and so i was buried, deep beneth the concrete life that was to be discovered, people took pictures and brought flowers ""a statue of what""
a statue of nothing but pity and despondency so severe that i was to be remembered as ""that monument over thurr"" marble never looked so weak, so fragile since ""la pieta"" was sculped by that ninja turtle, four walls so cold and white and no corner is confortable in my dungeon of darkness so bright, i'm wearing this smile of accomplishment and relief, yet i think that death it must be killing me, and i'm afraid of boredom and solitude, those two fucking idiots creep in and i'm always defeated, yet im happy and content, but what is happiness but a word

(the first use of the word happiness was recorded in 1340 it derrives from the word ""hap"" which means ""chance and furtune"" as in riches and wealth. then it went to mean lucky )

so that makes me think, what is happiness but a word that was just first put on paper in the 12th century, what about before that word came out, was there no need to be happy, it didn't exist, no one felt the pressure to be happy, no one wanted happiness, then after that our society has enbedded in our little weak minds that happiness is what life is about, now i sit here i wouldn't go as far as saying i'm happy, but im most definately in the best place i have ever been in my whole entire life, yet things knock me down and this whole money situation devours my insides like a fucking maggot and boredom kills me and i sink, and im sinking and im sinking sink sink sink sink sink sink sunk........"

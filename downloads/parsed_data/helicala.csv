"event","I consider myself an agnostic, because it is apparent to me that although a God or Gods have not been proven to exist, the concept of a God or Gods has not been disproven, either.


The following is a law of science:

Matter/energy cannot by itself be created or destroyed. Matter/energy may be changed from one form into another, but the total amount remains unchanged.


But was there always matter? Where did the original matter come from?

To me, the concept of the beginning of the Universe is mind-boggling. If the Big Bang theory is true, then where did that matter which exploded into the Universe come from? 

I don't believe we can trace the steps back to the beginning of beginnings. It seems the beginning is infinite. Where is the first beginning? And, if matter cannot be ""by itself created"", then how did the very first matter EVER get here? Suppose the Beginning is really the end of a beginning before that, and the beginning to the Beginning the end of another beginning? It's mind-boggling. Can science really explain this?

It seems the only explanation to me for the beginning being infinite is that there is a concept independent of time, which we as human beings will probably never be able to comprehend.

Although science has definitely proven much, I still don't see it disproving a God or Gods. Nor does it prove God, either."

"event","I donated blood a few weeks ago, and I just received my Blood Donor card in the mail. And, I know my blood type. It's B+.

According to the New York Blood Center, ""On average, 45% of the population is Type O, 40% Type A, 10% Type B and 5% Type AB.""

So, I have a rarer blood type. Also, my mother is Type A, so I must have my father's blood type."

"event","""I Always Get What I Want""
Avril Lavigne


Every now and then we all want something
Even if there's no way of gettin' it
If I stomp my feet, could that maybe be the way around it?
Could I get myself around it?

GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Everything I don't got
SO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
'Cause I'm a big shot!

Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say 'Well, that's just life'
I'll drown you out when I open my mouth
and make my way around it
I always make my way around it

GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Everything I don't got
SO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
'Cause I'm a big shot!

So give me what I want!
I always get what I want!
You don't want to see me when I don't get what I want
It's not what you want

I'm not about to take no for an answer, no
If I tell you I can't I'm still gonna go
I did it all by myself and I found
I found my way around it

GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Everything I don't got
SO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
'Cause I'm a big shot!

So give me what I want!
I always get what I want!
You don't want to see me when I don't get what I want
It's not what you want

It's not too lovely
It could start to get ugly
It really bugs me
IF I DON'T GET MY WAY!

GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Everything I don't got
SO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
'Cause I'm a big shot!

So give me what I want!
I always get what I want!
You don't want to see me when I don't get what I want
It's not what you want

If I don't get what I want, it's not what you want!"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night I had a dream that my house was like fucking haunted, and the fear was mostly in the constant feeling that somethng was wrong. I remember I was scared to go into my bedroom alone, but I had to get some things so I ran in, grabbed a huge load of clothes and shit and ran out. I looked back and I had dropped a ring of mine on the ground, but my hands were full so I decided to go back and get it. but when I got there it was gone. Then in my dream I remembered someone telling me that ""They"" will take anything that falls on the ground ""as soon as you leave the room."" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I was really fucking scared, and my mom was in the next room watching TV or something and I tried to tell her that something was wrong, but I couldn't speak without great physical effort, and when I did speak my voice was very faint like I had laryngitis or something.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I also remember that whenever I went to the bathroom, the lights would go out because ""They"" would put them out. Then I remember looking out the window into our side yard where the pool is, and I saw a bunch of unoccupied lawn chairs on the lawn, and like a satellite and a bunch of pipes and shit, and maybe some wires, too. Then I heard something about how aliens were setting up all this shit in our yard. Then I started wondering whether ""They"", the spirits, were really aliens."

It was my mother's idea, so for some reason I thought she would wake me up. So, I go to sleep, have some unpleasant dreams about my mother being sent off to prison for some reason, and then next thing I know, she's waking me up and saying it's 5:30 p.m.! Fuck! She wants to give me two Lunesta tonight, but Jesus Christ, how many sides effects does THIS drug have?"

"event","Today I went in to work, wore an expressionless face for an hour and a half, then broke down and started crying. The boss sent me home; had someone drive me. He said I couldn't work in that condition.

I am the angriest today that I have been in probably a couple of years. I know why I was crying - because I am sick and fed up of this empty ""life"" and all the meaningless shit that comes with it. I know I'm expected to accept it, because that's supposed to be like, the ""mature"" thing to do, but I won't. And so many times, I've put on the ""mature"" face and tried to have a self-disciplined work ethic, tried to ""suck it up"", I suppose, but I just want this follower, ""mature"" side of me to die and for the rebel to come right back and accomplish something so amazing that I can say ""Fuck everyone!"" and truly be a heroine. I'm sick of people saying they're proud of me for ""maturing"", when really I've just learned to fit in with this stupid society which I used to rightfully detest. That's what our culture considers maturity; maturity has become synonymous with acceptance, like accepting a shitty job or a conformist lifestyle. Maybe acceptance in other forms can be a virtue, but if I don't accept something, my natural human response will be to find a way to break free. And that is better than acceptance. I want more out of life. And I'm not stopping until I get what I want.

I'm posting this song by Sentenced, because it's about someone who is viewed as a hero by his friends because he does what is expected of him and pushes forward into all the most brutal parts of battle, but really he just wants to die. And I feel now as if there is a side of me that must perish.

Sentenced
""May Today Become the Day""
from The Funeral Album


Rain drums the lifeless ground
Drops as cold as ice
The dawn's breaking, the trench a-shaking
Their fire hits us all around
And the siren cries
""Forward! Forward!"" - We go into attack!

May today become the day
As I plunge into the grey
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't how it's like

Closing in, not slowing down
Iron, fire, blood
Our line's breaking and death a-taking
Our men from all around
Into the pools of mud
Forward, forward... There is no turning back!

May today become the day
As I plunge into the grey
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't how it's like

The fall back -calling as our soldiers keep falling
No, forward, forward! I am not turning back!

May today become the day
As I plunge into the grey
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I... just want a bullet between my eyes!
Aim high!"

I can go for six and a half hours, but eight hours with no break and no food SUCKS. You'd think the kitchen would feed us some of that gourmet Italian food we have to stare at all day, but they don't. It would be the least they can do since we don't get paid for training. I got a $10 tip from this couple I waited on, but I didn't get to keep any of it because I CAN'T GET PAID DURING TRAINING. *sigh* 

I hope I will start getting paid on Monday. I'm going to be working three nights a week. Thursday wasn't bad because I mostly waited tables, but Friday sucked because I was working at the bar getting drinks in the constant Friday night rush, and putting away burning hot glasses from the dishwasher crates with my bare hands. I also carried a heavy bucket of ice upstairs a few times. Eventually, Tom yelled at the guy who was training me for having me do a ""guy's"" job. I didn't mind, but then when I found out that the restaurant does not pay for training, I felt like a slave. I cut myself slicing a lime. And I can't stand customers who complain about a fucking stain on their water glass. 

I did not feel like playing music when I got home. But I worked on some lyrics. They're pretty fucking good. 

I am torn as to whether I should take this job or look for another. I was thinking of applying at Cosi. I can wear almost anything I want there. But in Bedford, we get big tips because people are rich. I doubt I would get $10 tips at a restaurant in Mount Kisco. *sigh* I don't know what to do."

"event","So, I went to the local restaurant for my ""training"" today. I was nervous to begin with, but I was prepared to deal with it. When I spoke with the manager on Saturday, he told me to come in wearing ""black pants, black shoes, and a black shirt."" Okay, fair enough.
   
So, today was the day. I wore these dressy black velvet pants. I had a button down black shirt; it was a bit short, so I put on another black shirt underneath and tucked it in. I wore these mary-jane/ballet slippers type black shoes with very thin white pinstripes. My mother approved very much of the outfit.

I went in, and the staff recognized right away that I was wearing their uniform and asked me if I was there to train. A young man who worked there showed me over to the dining room. I asked him where I should put my purse and jacket, and he instructed me to put it upstairs in the office. The manager. Tom, was there.    

The first thing Tom noticed was that I was wearing no socks. He freaked out. 
     ""Does anyone have socks for her?"" He asked the other employees. 

And I was thinking, ""What the FUCK?""  I see women in the professional world all the time wearing shoes with no socks as long as their toes are covered. So I said, ""Oh, sorry... I didn't know... so... I guess now I know for next time."" 

Obviously disgusted, he told me to go downstairs and told a girl who worked there to show me around. ""This is the private dining room,"" she began telling me. ""We try not to use it, but..."" 

""Wait!"" Tom barked. ""What are you wearing? I told you to wear black slacks. I told you not to wear jeans."" 

I looked at my black velvet pants and said, ""These aren't jeans. They're black velvet pants."" 

""They look like jeans to me,"" he said, annoyed.

""Oh, well, I had no idea these were considered jeans,"" I said. ""I thought black velvet pants were considered dress pants."" **Note, these pants were not in any way Gothic. They were simple black velvet pants**

So he said, ""Where do you live?""

""Just down the road,"" I replied.

""Alright, go home. Do you have any black pants at home?""

I looked at the ones he was wearing (the typical dress pants made of that like artificial material) and said, ""No, not like those."" 

""Alright,"" he said, just go home and put black socks on. 

He followed me outside. ""I TOLD you to wear BLACK SHOES!"" 

I said, ""They are black."" 

He said, ""They have stripes on them."" 

I said, ""Oh, well, at home, I have black sneakers but they also have pinstripes, and I have these like black combat boots."" 

He said, ""Alright, come back on Wednesday and we'll start over.""




His employees were wearing black sneakers! So, black sneakers without pinstripes are better than classy black shoes with pinstripes? His instructions on Saturday were ambiguous; what does he expect? I don't think I'm going to bother going back. I don't want to work for an asshole like that."

I'm really depressed right now. Guitar just doesn't have a history of coming naturally to me. It just started feeling somewhat natural a couple of months ago, and now that natural feeling is going away. Why is it so difficult? I practice. I do the exercises my guitar teacher gives me. I'm not trying to be Alexi Laiho. Voice is my first instrument, and I'd be happy just being a decent rhythm guitarist. So, why does my hard work hardly seem to be paying off? *heavy sigh*"

"event","Yesterday I wet to the big bloody Cap and Gown Graduation Ceremony. It was long, boring and miserably hot, and  when I finally found my mom in the crowd, I just wanted to go home. She suggested we go out to eat and celebrate and aked me where I would like to go. I told her I wasn't sure and that I just wanted to go home first.

She went ahead and made plans to go to The Cheesecake Factory. I told her I hated The Cheesecake Factory, and her argument was that it was my own fault for not coming to a decision. Anyway, she said, ""We'll go out for your graduation celebration another time. We're all just very hungry and crabby right now."" Okay, fine.

So, now on to the point of this entree, I mean entry - The Cheesecake Factory sucks. The food is not HORRIBLE, but really, I just don't get what all the hype is about. I don't get why there's a two-hour wait every night for a table at a gigantic restaurant that serves mediocre food. The iced tea with its mango flavor is very good, I'll give them that. But the entrees I have ordered in the past have not been phenomenal. I've ordered some pasta dish; it was just okay, and some ""Navajo"" Sandwich with grilled chicken and avocado and stuff which wasn't bad, but it doesn't make them phenomenal - it's difficult to mess up a sandwich. And their fries are nothing spectacular.
     So, after trying to get through their 100-page menu, I decided on the Orange Chicken with vegetables. I was expecting broccoli, as that is what is usually served with Orange Chicken. I was wrong. The dish came with snow peas - lousy. Sometimes whe I eat snow peas I feel like I am eating praying mantis wings. But I guess that's my own fault for ASSUMING it came with broccoli. Here's the part where I can justly complain: The ""Orange Chicken"", A Mandarin dish, tasted like McDonald's chicken mcnuggets with their sugary sauce. Orange Chicken is supposed to be sweet, tangy and spicy all at the same time. This orange chicken was sweet only. And the rice, I believe, was not sticky rice, but plain white rice. I sent the dish back. The manager or whatever came over and said, ""May I ask specifically what it is about the dish that you don't like?""
""Yeah, it's like... *wannabe* Asian,"" I said.
He nodded. ""Well, it's meant to be an Asian fusion dish,"" he replied.
I should have known. Which leads me to my next complaint - Asian fushion. Nothing disgusts me more than the thought of a wonton wrapper filled with cream cheese. Westernization is a damn shame. Asian food is absolutely perfect on its own. Why do Americans have to ruin it? Years ago I figured out that ordering Asian dishes at non-Asian restaurants was a bad idea; this is now confirmed. I thought since the Cheescake Factory was supposed to be sooooo amazing *rolls eyes* that they would be able to pull it off. Well, they don't pull it off. White Man just can not cook Yellow Man's food."

You raise your fist against the sky
You cannot reach the stars
I wonder, where do we belong?

It's in your mind, and it flows freely
Underneath the atmosphere
We are the same, you and I.

And the stars burn like eyes, a crowd watching
Time and space expand
There is Hell and sacrifice in all people;
Try to understand.

'Why is there pain? Why is there suffering?'
They ask, 'When will it end?'
They want to learn of right and wrong

The great black backdrop in the sky is needed
Why should we pretend that there is
Light without shadows?

And the stars burn like eyes, a crowd watching
Time and space expand
There is Hell and sacrifice in all people;
Try to understand"

"event","In a 1965 newspaper article, the use of LSD for psychiatric medical purposes was supported:

""All children who were given LSD... daily for one month were said to have improved. Side effects, toxic reactions and regressive behavior were not encountered. The findings indicated most favorable results. Contrary to assertions in the popular press, when LSD is administered as part of a therapeutic medical program, 'irreversible psychotic changes' and 'brain damage' do not occur. Certain irresponsible statements that it does produce such adverse effects have not been supported by valid scientific evidence. Like any drug, LSD belongs in the hands of responsible medical authorities."" 

     ""When public outcry in the 1960s eventually made LSD illegal, the psychiatric companies moved on to other psychotrophic products.""

I think this is warning enough on both the gross dangers of psychiatric drugs and the irresponsibility of the pharmaceutical companies.

"event","It seems lately that I have been fluctuating between two different moods. One of these moods is my being extremely content with the cycles of the earth and the way life works, naturally high off the supreme balance of: good and evil, success and failure, life and death, hope and despair, and so on. When I am in this mood I feel as though almost anything can happen to me and I will still be happy. And, no matter how boring the current activity, I am not bored.

The second mood is a mood of boredom and dissatisfaction. But it is a constructive mood, I believe, because I am driven to get myself in a state where I am not bored. A state where I am being productive, or laughing, or full of emotion. I recall explaining this driving boredom to my mom, and her response was that I must have a passion for life. 

I've changed a lot in only a year. Last year when I was bored I would get depressed; I don't get depressed anymore. One who is truly depressed does not strive to get out of his/her state of depression. S/he has lost all hope and thus has lost all faith in it ever being any better. Now, I get upset and anxious and annoyed and angry, but I do not get depressed. I want to get out of my bad moods, not continue wading deeper into them. And the journeys out of my bad states are ironically enjoyable to me. It's like playing a game of chess; the greatest glory is the accomplished feeling of putting one's opponent in Check. Check is even more exciting than Check Mate, because after Check Mate the game is over, and, well, it was more fun  while you were playing the game.

It is emotion that I crave. I'd rather be enveloped in the greatest sadness than to not feel anything at all."

"event","For years, cow's milk has been revered as healthful food neccessary for the growth of strong bones and healthy brain development. The dairy industry in America spends hundreds of millions of dollars in campaigning for milk and cheese in public schools. I can still recall middle school when a student at lunch was not allowed to pass to the checkout until he had a carton of milk or juice on his tray. 
In my freshman year of high school, I transferred from Warwick Valley High School, on the west side of the Hudson River, to Fox Lane High School, in high class Bedford on the other side of the Hudson. I ate the school's cream cheese bagels for breakfast, and usually pizza or chicken parmagiana for lunch. By the winter of my sophomore year, I was missing school due to frequent fevers and colds. I was also having an immensely difficult time singing. Then, one day, I heard about dairy products and how they inhibited singing ability. It made sense - dairy products cause mucus, and mucus clogs the throat. Desperate to improve vocally, I began to cut down on dairy, first the heavier things like cream cheese, and eventually, replaced the sweet cream butter on my bagel with Soy Garden, a non-dairy ""butter"" made of olive oil and soy. I was amazed at how much clearer my voice was sounding, and decided the sacrifice was well worth the improvement in my art. For years, I had been completely clueless that milk was the worst thing I could do for my voice.

Somewhere between cutting out the cream cheese and the butter, I asked the school lunch lady if I could substitute juice for milk on my lunch tray. She said the juice cartons were only put out in the morning for breakfast, and that if I wanted juice with my lunch I would have to pay extra for can of Welch's. I was furious. I told her I was lactose-intolerant, and that I should not have to pay extra for a milk alternative. She became frustrated and told me I would have to speak to someone in the higher school office about it, and bring in a doctor's note. I began to sympathize with the vegan kids who were forced to either bring lunch or live off the school's french fries (cooked in canola oil) and teensy boxes of SunMaid raisins. Whatever happened to my middle school in Warwick, where juice was always offered as an alternative to milk?

My new milk-free diet made it difficult for me to find food in Daisy the Dairy Cow's America, so I looked to Asia. Asians have been living with very little or no milk for centuries, and are said to enjoy better health than their fellow humans in the Western Hemisphere. The original diets of the Japanese and Thai peoples, for example, are rich in vegetables, fish, tofu/bean curd, and rice, a far cry from the Western diet, high in red meat, bread, and milk products, especially cheese. Asia is also the area of origin for the martial arts, which recognize the healthy human body as a lethal weapon in combat. It is true that martial arts use weapons such as nunchaku (more commonly known as numchucks), and even swords. But in many, many situations, the martial artist is able to make lethal use of his body free of weapons. 

Surprise, surprise. What kind of American, whose mother poured him glasses of milk every night with dinner, would even think that a milk-free diet would enable him to, for lack of a better term, kick somebody's ass? Well, the fact is that Asia, which consumes the least amount of milk in the world, has historically made the fullest lethal use of the human body. Who would have thought that the group of people responsible for breaking wood with a single kick clears their throats the least? If milk was really vital in the growth of strong bones, the martial arts would not have flourished in Asia. I'd like to explain THAT to the dairy propaganda industry of America.

Another surprising truth is the link between milk and osteoporosis. Now, I'm sure you've heard all about how osteoporosis creates bone fractures. The myths about milk have caused people to believe that drinking milk will prevent bone loss and therefore prevent osteoprosis. Bone loss is a result of too much protein in the diet, and milk is a protein that has been called ""liquid meat."" Milk is high in calcium, but the body needs comparable amounts of magnesium, a mineral element, to absorb calcium. Milk and its products have very low levels of magnesium. If you're shy of the science, there are statistics that prove the flaws of milk in the prevention of osteoporosis;

""Countries with the highest rates of osteoporosis, such as the United States, England, and Sweden, consume the most milk. China and Japan, where people eat much less protein and dairy food, have low rates of osteoporosis.""

Nutrition Action Healthletter, June, 1993 


""About 50,000 Americans die each year of problems related in some way to osteoporosis.""

Osteoporosis International 1993;3(3)

""There is no significant association between teenaged milk consumption and the risk of adult fractures. Data indicate that frequent milk consumption and higher dietary calcium intakes in middle aged women do not provide protection against hip or forearm fractures... women consuming greater amounts of calcium from dairy foods had significantly increased risks of hip fractures, while no increase in fracture risk was observed for the same levels of calcium from nondairy sources.""

12-year Harvard study of 78,000 women American Journal of Public Health 1997;87


Yes, the truth about milk is very surprising to those of us who were raised on it.


It is common for a woman to take calcium supplements for relief from menstrual cramps, but really she should be increasing her magnesium intake. Magnesium has also been linked as an important mineral in the prevention of arthritis. A person with a magnesium deficiency is likely to have calcium collect in the soft tissues of her body, where it is poorly absorbed into the blood and bones. The answer is not to take more calcium, but to increase magnesium intake so as to get a better balance of calcium and magnesium. Dr. Guy Abraham, M.D., a research gynecologist and endocrinologist in premenstrual syndrome and osteoporosis, found that a woman should take TWICE as much magnesium as calcium in order to produce a certain chemical. A deficiency of this chemical can lead to osteoporosis.

Foods rich in magnesium include nuts, whole grains such as brown rice, millet, buckwheat (kasha), whole wheat, triticate, and rye, and legumes including lentils, split peas, and varieties of beans. I would like to point out that in Asia, consumption of rice is high, as well as beans (soy). Nuts, often peanuts, are used frequently in Thai cooking.  

If you really are concerned with building strong bones, the answer is not to consume more dairy, but to increase the magnesium in your diet and, according to new research, tea in the diet may increase bone density. In a Taiwanese study published in 2002, study authors Chih-Hsing Wu and Chih-Jen Chang of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan, Taiwan found that habitual tea drinking benfits bones. Tea, particulary green tea, is high in flouride and flavanoids which preserve bone density. When it comes to green tea versus black tea, green tea is the healthier choice. Not only does it have lots of flouride and flavanoids, but significantly less caffeine than black tea, and black tea is often taken with milk. Green tea has also been linked to protection from cancer because of its antioxidants.

In the past, I would urge only singers to cut milk products out of their diets. But I had always suspected that milk was not all it was cracked up to be. As a child, my father would try to get me to drink soy milk and rice milk as an alternative to cow's milk. I thought he was crazy. He believed that human consumption of cow's milk was unnatural, as a cow's body produced milk to feed its calves, just as a human mother produces breast-milk to feed her human baby. Now I realize that his beliefs about milk were very rational. My mother told me that when she was married to my father, he used to complain of milk products causing a ""lump in his throat,"" as they create mucus in all people. I now find that I am much more comfortable when I am not constantly trying to clear my throat of mucus. I can sing more clearly and find I have more vocal flexibility. I have also discovered that since I cut milk out of my diet, my frequent colds have diminished. I believe the truth about milk is clear; in statistics, science, and common sense. Just a week ago I bought an almond-covered pretzel at the Palisades mall and thought that something about it tasted disgusting. I realized that the almonds must have been ""glued"" to the pretzel with butter. Now that my body has been 99% cleared of dairy products, the taste of butter is disgusting to my tongue. I really don't miss dairy that much at all, except for cream cheese bagels. But then I think of how if I eat that bagel, I will be clearing my throat for hours. The brief pleasure in eating it isn't worth the nuisance, and it certainly isn't worth compromising my health or vocal abilities.

Some dairy alternatives I use and recommend:

Milk:
Rice Dream for cereal
Silk soymilk for cooking

Butter:
Soy Garden 100% Vegan Buttery Spread - great on bread, baked potatoes, veggies, or anywhere else you would use butter. Absolutely no cholesterol, no trans fats, and tastes far better than Smart Balance, though Soy Garden might be a bit more fattening. 

When everyone's ordering pizza:
Slice of cheeseless salad pizza.

Cheese on a sandwich or burger:
Avocado is hearty like cheese and usually makes for great sandwiches.

Restaurants:
Burger or sandwich without the cheese, pasta without cheese, anything you know isn't creamy. Or, try Asian restaurants, where usually the only milk is in green tea ice cream (most likely a product of westernization) or Thai iced tea or coffee, which you can order without milk."

It's a song based on a dream I had about suburban life and the American dream. In my song's world, parents are so obsessed with having clean, uncluttered houses that they keep their children's toys in the basement and make them play down there. And I'm stuck in this world as an observer and losing sleep, noting how there is more harm in perfection because a perfect life is not a life; if you live flawlessly you're not really living. It always intrigues me how people seek a life of pure happiness, yet they don't seem to realize that if everything was perfect they'd be completely bored with no goals to work on, and boredom and apathy would create the downfall that leads to depression. To say that pure happiness leads to depression is a paradox indeed, but it's true. Take it from someone who overcame depression (without taking a single pill), there needs to be a BALANCE. BALANCE is key."

Spent Friday ice-skating with my school, and was pleasantly surprised that I had fun, then hung out with Stan for the first time in almost a year... Saturday protested the Iraqi war with my 27-year-old teacher, two classmates and a bunch of old hippies and got extra credit in Social Studies (the ""protest"" was really just a standing on a street corner with a ""honk for peace"" sign thing. I made a reproduction of the Lennon-Ono ""WAR IS OVER - IF YOU WANT IT"" billboards of the late '60s). And today, as aforementioned, the recital. 

I've also even FURTHER realized that anti-depressents are corrupt and the best cure for depression is daily exercise (and I mean REAL exercise, running)a healthy living enviornment, and self-progress. It really pisses me off that so many therapists think the answer to all of life's little tearjerkers is in a little pill. I have learned, and I have learned well, that anti-depressents are the easy way out in the moment, but in the long run they're just no good for you. I suspect that all they really do is create the chemicals in your brain that would just as well if not better be achieved through daily exercise."

I feel ill, though it's all mental. My mother is a crazy woman who, just because she supposedly did not get any encouragement as a teenager, believes she has to speak to me about college every time I blink. She gets me a new book every fucking week, whether it's ""The Internship Bible"" or ""The Scholarship Book"" or ""The Scholarship Scouting Report"", she always gets me something. I'm a junior. I'm not graduating this year, though she seems to think I am. I have enough stress, I put enough pressure on MYSELF as it is; I don't need her barking at me. One thing that REALLY pisses me off is that I'll be in my room, playing guitar or singing, and she'll tell me to do my homework instead. I tell her, ""Music schools also care a great deal about your ability to play your instrument, you know."" She seems to think grades are more important. She tells me she believes the two are equally important, yet, she freaks out if I fall slightly behind in school, but thinks nothing of it if I go for a week without playing guitar. Hell, she doesn't even notice. 

     Yesterday we went to the fucking NYU tour and my mother made me really uncomfortable. The student tour guide was an English major, and my mother told the tour guide, ""Well, JILLIAN COULD be an English Major, she should at least MINOR in it, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah."" I've told her a hundred times that I don't want to major in English. I want to major in Music, probably Music Production and possibly minor in visual art or drawing. Writing is great and all that, but honestly English classes are very boring to me and I'd rather be making noise or drawing pretty pictures. But anyway, I told my mother after the tour left that she made me very uncomfortable when she said that. She appologized and tried to sound like she meant it, but I know she didn't. I get more musical encouragement from the kids at SCHOOL than I do from my family. Music means nothing to her. If I'm locked up in my room, crying because I can't get the sounds in my head to play on my guitar, she either ignores it, or, she comes in, acts like she's being all comforting and motherly, then asks me if I finished my homework and leaves the room pissed off if I say, ""No."" I feel so uncomfortable now when she hugs me or touches my face. I just feel like I don't want her to touch me.

     Another thing that doesn't help is that ACES assigns the Book Talk project - the longest and most difficult project of the year - within the same 4-week frame before the SATs. As for the SATs, I will never pass to begin with. As for the Book Talk project, I'm just very angry at my school.

     I went to bed last night nearly in tears, mostly from my mother but also from school and the stupid fucking NYU tour. The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at NYU is supposed to be a wonderful program for aspiring music producers, but only accepts 24 students at a time. I can't compete with that! This is why I'm stressed. This is why I'm miserable. And this is why I don't sleep."

I cannot help it
I couldn't stop it if I tried
The same old heartbeat
Fills the emptiness 
I have inside
And I heard that you can't fight love
So I won't complain
'Cause why would I stop the fire that keeps me going on?

'Cause when there's you I feel whole
And there's no better feeling in the world
But without you, I'm alone
And I'd rather be in love... with you

Turn out the lights now
To see is to believe
I just want you near me
I just want you here with me
And I'd give up everything only for you
It's the least that I could do
                                     
'Cause when there's you I feel whole
And there's no better feeling in the world
But without you, I'm alone
And I'd rather be in love... with you

And I feel you holding me

Why are we afraid to be in love?
To be loved
I can't explain it
I know it's tough
To be loved

And I feel you holding me

Oh, and when there's you I feel whole
And there's no better feeling in the world
But without you, I'm alone
And I'd rather be in love...

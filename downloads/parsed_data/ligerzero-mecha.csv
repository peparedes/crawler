"event","T-T How come my life sucks so much. To the brink of insanity with all that continues to plague my every thought. Everything transforming... My once cheerful interior is crumbling, and my past warm smiles turning grim as the days crawl by.

My mother and I refuse to get along, we refuse to see directly eye-to-eye. 

What can I do? But envy those who have what I want... And will never get, so long as I live. How I long to be pampered and spoiled like the princess I deserve to be. But.. Alas... That's not the life for me... I'm just the simple peasant that is to forever spit shine the shoes of my superiors. And gravel at their every motion and spoken word.

My fingers have never touched the expensive neccessities that everyone but I seem to have. What have I in the first place? An out dated console with a hole through the cover? An mp3 player that holds only 140 of my over 400 collection. A cheap twenty dollar digital camera that has a horrible focus. I can't even take a decent picture of my artwork, without someone complaining about how bad the picture was, as if it were taken by the first prototype of the picture phone.

When I get something that is in the least half decent, it feels like someone is always getting something better. I shall give no examples, for I wish to make no foes, just balance. And so far... While every one is on that high golden plated platter on higher and lighter side of the balance beam. While I stand, along with others of my situation, that have almost near to nothing, but the roof over their head, and minimum food, that barely lasts till the next pay-cheak. Standing heavy hearted, and defeated, almost as if mocked by those who have so much more than I.

I can do nothing but cry for myself, I refuse to have someone pay for me. And if it happends, I feel so uncomfortable, so out of place. As if I was as horrible and cold hearted as those who use others for their own pleasures that can only be filled by materialistic objects. Some throwing around thousands of dollars as if it were pocket change! I have never even seen a thousand dollars, much less spend anythink over 200 dollars on myself.

But, who am I to complain? I have no importance to the world I live in. My skills were insulted, my pride was stepped on, and my ego has dissolved from all traces. 

If I continue any further, I will end up in a depressed mood for the rest of the week. So good bye. And salutations."

"event","Ever get the feeling that you're being left outta the loop? Yeah, that's me at the current moment. 

I've had my ups and downs at this school. But that's not the cause. I just feel so outta touch with my old friends. I mean, come on, I don't know what's going on and if I did, I have no way to stop it. What. The. Hell. Is. Going. On? Being...well...me, I have a need to satisfy my curiousity as I know many other people have too. I'll constantly pester people if I want to know. So tell me. Tell me what's going on. Just tell me. 

I'm utterly confused. Watching as people are conversing about a topic I have no clue about. It's utterly hopeless...Nah. Hopeless isn't the right word. I guess, confusing would be it. 

Being who I am, I always want to know what's going on. Either at my current school and my old school. Well, most of the time I want to know. If it's about boys, all I need to know is that I don't like half of 'em.

Blah...

"event","My first day back and it was a living hell. The boss was an asshole the entire day. Sunday's seriously are just not my days. When I got there, the vet claimed that I was precicely fourty-five minutes late... When he told my mom that I could come in at eight that morning.

So after his little temper tantrum, I went and started working... Some of you think you have it bad? Try cleaning cages, that housed evil devil cats! Seriously... The thing was backed up into the corner of the crate like I was going to put him on the stove and make Kitty-Alfrado! X| Stupid cats... And when I finally got to cat to understand that I wasn't going to hurt him, he let me pick him up to put him in another cage while I cleaned his. Just when I'm opening the other cage, one of the other girls slams the door to the kennel room and sends the cat (That I'm still holding) on a major rampage using anything and everything in his reach as a stratching post.

That inculded me... I have four long hair line cuts across my hand, two on my nose, and another on my cheek, near my right eye. The devil nearly clawed my eye out! (the good one too! >_< ) After I got that taken care of, I had to go was my face, and hands... Cats are filthy, the vet even told me my first day. ""If you get, scratched or bitten by a cat, clean the wound imidiately."" Filthy creatures!

Well... The only other happening that day was getting bitten on the hand by a dog when I attemted to remove her collar. Sheesh! And I had to bathe her after that! She weight a good fourty somethin pounds! I had to lift all that dead weight into a tub, chain her head up, and muzzle her. All with a sore hand.

So... Have fun at work you guys! Pray for me! XDDD Full shifts next Saturday(hopefully not) and Sunday 7:00am-6:30pm

"event","FUCK LIFE AND ALL IT'S SHITTY-NESS.... And all the beings living one!

Go on living your poorly painted reality, your sad excuse for a stage set up... I will be in the audience softly chuckling, and slowly clapping to myself when all your ""Oh so perfect"" Cut outs fall. Just remember one thing, while you stand on that stage, frightened, alone, and fucked over... ""How does it feel?""

I love you mommy... But I can't wait to leave..."

"event","I'm your typical robot loving, zoid fanatic girl... Okay so maybe not so typical. But, yeah... As you can see... I love Ligerzero! ^_^ He is my alltime favorite! Zoids, as many people may not know, has had a large impact on my life. I love zoids and forever will! &lt;3 

Now, moving on to better things... 

I'm a hyper active kid, who sees the word in a completely different perspective than others. And I eat my ice cream with a fork! I'm easy to get along with, and even though I may appear stupid... But, people underestimate my ability to control a situation and prejudge my choices. 

My mom is an excellent example on this issue. Normally my mom will wrap herself up with all these boyfriends... And I would warn her about them, all the time... It's like I see through the fake shit these men create to get to my mom... And she's more gullible than myself... So she normally does away with my words and follows the guy. And so far, it has ALWAYS ended in distaster! 

I've never beeing spoiled in my entire life! So I normally loathe the persons who get everything that they ask for. Which just happends to be my cousins. It's ""Daddy I want this!"" And just like a magical genine it is granted! And what ticks me off completely, is when the person takes what they got and seriously rub it in your face, like they know you hate it! -_-... 

Blah... I've had enough typing... I only created this accout completly out of boredom... So, whatever...

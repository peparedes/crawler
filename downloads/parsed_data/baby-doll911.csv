<P><FONT color=#6666cc><STRONG>So, I survived the weekend with Olivia. YAYYY! Lol. She drove me craaaaazzzzyy i swear to god. Oh well though.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>Im goin' thru some shit with Jeremy. I get the feeling that he doesnt trust me or something... because he got all mad when he saw on my site it says i have a crush on 2 people. just because it says i have a crush on someone else doesnt mean anything... well maybe it does to him but thats not the way I am.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>I kinda do like someone though. I don't even care if people know this, yes, even you jeremy, because nothing wud ever happen until im single or something. ish. only 2 people know about it - abby, and well.. him&nbsp;lol. oh well. im screwed up i know.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>I've been trying stuff lately that i shouldnt. I dont really know if i like it or not, but lets juss say this - if my mom ever found out that i did it she would shoot me. But its weird - my dad is the strict one, but i don't think he wud care.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>I have somewhat of a confession to make. And maybe some of those people I said it to will be mad at me but nobody knows what was going through my head when I thought of it. At the dance, when Wesley found out I had kissed sum1 else, I actually didnt. There was so much shit going on with us that I couldn't take much more, and I was tired of always being the one to break things off. I thought that if I told him that, he would break up with me, and then I wouldnt have to feel so bad all the time. The reason I was so upset all night was because&nbsp;I knew I had made a huge mistake saying that. The truth of the matter is..&nbsp;I miss him. :(</FONT></STRONG></P>

After a while Olivia left me alone and I just hung out by myself and with Keegan and Molly.
Everyone except me and Keegan are asleep right now. We're both going to bed in about 20 minutes.
Spent the rest of the evening playing Sim's with Keegan, and talking to a couple people on MSN. Kinda Boring.
I'll update again tomorrow. Maybe. might be stuck out here an extra night because of the storm. Who knows."

Im at my dad's girlfriend's house for the weekend in Eastern Shore. She has 3 kids - Olivia (6), Molly (9), and Keegan (11). Keegan and Molly I'm ok with, but Olivia's driving me up the wall. For like an hour she was in here reading every word I say to people on MSN! Out loud, btw, so that anyone else could hear it too. Laura finally came in and dragged her out though, thank god. I brought Sim's - Bustin' Out with me this weekend for them to play. Every since I got here yesterday night they've all been obsessed with it and won't let each other play.
Keegan: I gotta get a new job...
Molly: Keegan when is it  my turn????
Olivia: Can I have a turn Keegan? Pleassseee?? Lemme have a turn keegan!
ERG!
Might update again later. It's only 6:00."

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>Let's see... I'm just going to start at yesterday..</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>So when I was gettin ready to leave to go back to school after lunch, I got this huge dizzy spell.. like seriously i could have passed out i wuz soo dizzy..So I went upstairs to lay down n stuff. My mom had just left for work at like 12:30 so I couldn't call her or anything to tell her I wasn't going to school. but haha lucky me she just so happened to come back at like 1:30. Well... I wasn't so lucky. I told her that I wasn't feeling good but i was starting to feel better now.. Ooh she got soo friggin mad at me it's not even funny. She started yellin' at me sayin that I was home playin' hookie n shit like that. The last thing she said before she slammed the door behind her was ""YOU'RE NOT GOIN' TO THAT GOD DAMNED DANCE TONIGHT AND IF I FIND OUT YOU WERE THERE YOU'RE GONNA BE GROUNDED FOR A MONTH!!!"" Soo... yeah...Like a half hour after she left I started feeling better so I decided to go down to the Head-Shoppe and get somethin funky done with my hair for the dance. I got pink streaks :D It looks soooo friggin awesome!!! When I got home the phone was ringing.. It was my mum. She was asking why I hadn't been answering the phone for 2 hours. I told her I was sleeping.. lol.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>At like 5:00 I called Abby and asked her if she wanted to come over and get ready for the dance together...So she did. Lol. At like 6:15 we left to go to the dance. It was soo friggin windy.. and poor abby was wearing a skirt lolz. She was holding her ass all the way to the school lolz (we couldn't get a ride cuz we dint have ne money for a cab and my mom wud kill me if she knew that I was going.. lol). It was soo much fun there :D I danced with 2 guys.. Jeff and Jeremy. I got asked out twice too! lol. I feel bad for saying no to Jeff.. cuz hes my friend n stuff (and yes I know you people who know him are totally judging me for being his friend but hes really nice if you actually take the time to get to know him..) but me and jeremy have already gone out before and we didn't really last all that long and i wanted to give things another chance with him cuz we were kinda good together.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>Abby also asked Nick A out. At first he said no because he likes Fiona, but then he ended up saying yes... only to dump her 20 minutes later. she was crying so much! GOD nick is such an ass!! I swear i feel like punching his face in... Im not even kidding. abby is like my best friend and NOBODY hurts her without concequences!! erg he makes me soo fuckin' mad...</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>so I come home at lunch today.. and summin smelled sooo fuckin' good! so I asked my mom what smelled so good.. and shes like ""It's a TV dinner.. last one... its mine, not yours"" and im like oh thanks for saving me something to eat. We didn't have anything else that i can make and eat in 20 minutes... So I ate one of those ice cream drumsticks. My mom is so pissed at me for nothing, and shes ignoring me. My own mother!!!! She didn't even say hello to me when i came home after school. ERG I HATE HER!!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>I'll prolly update again later.. it's only 4:00.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>Oh and Ben? Yeah thanks for making sure everyone knows my locker combo..</FONT></STRONG></P>"

Deven doesn't talk to me anymore. Me and Brittany haven't talked in god knows how long. I don't really like Elaine. All my friends from&nbsp;Bedford, I can't talk to because either I'm not close enough with them to talk to them on the phone, and I don't have MSN, or I just don't have their phone numbers.

His girlfriend is someone I think is my friend... and I would never do that to her because she's really nice. I just don't understand how she got him.. when I've liked him for like 1 1/2&nbsp;yrs but haven't had any progress. And he&nbsp;knows&nbsp;I like him. Actually, almost everyone knows&nbsp;that.

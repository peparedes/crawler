so i'm wanting to keep up on the lj.  i've deleted people i don't ""know"" so i can work on that.  work's ok.  hours are random and tiring, but it's nice not having a desk job.  it's weird cause all the guys i work with are in really good shape, so of course i want to look at their musculature when they strip down naked in the lounge as they feel they need to do, but then it looks like i'm checking them out, which i'm not...not in their sense of the words.  there are only like 5 female trainers and the other day one of the males mentioned them needing more lesbian trainers which lead me to, ""what do you mean 'more'"", right?  yeah.  

block party tomorrow.  woot.

thing's've been going...yeah, they've been good.  i'm kind of officially a personal trainer now.  i've got two clients today.  it's a little earlier than expected, but it's good.  gotta get paid.  they're two 40something french guys.  they wanted a T1 (Tier 1). starting today i'm getting trained by one of the T3s.  In return, I'm gonna school him on some taekwondo.  hot stuff.  Plus i've got Ray (another trainer) boxing with me.  I'm gonna be a machine. a machine i tell you :o*

in other news, the band...we've got a date!  November 6th, NYC marathon.  we want to play before that though...sept 23rd ish perhaps.  the marathon gig is 3-5 hours which means our learning about 30 covers in 2 months.  yeah, baby.  i like a challenge.  

next weekend's the block party.  i'm excited 'cept i don't think mary or erica are going to be able to make it.  looks like it's just gonna be new york peeps, which is cool.  erik and ej and i went out on friday night.  i got extremely belligerent.  i think it was a combination of the cachaca and the full friggin moon.  we went to Rififi (of course) with this russian chick who made us miss the Have Her Home By 10 show so we could go to this bunk assed closet of an art opening.  it was cool to go to an opening, but it was bs.  and then she broke out from Rififi because the 80s music made her freak out and reminded her of her coke days.  yeah, i dunno.  it was a crazy assed night and after Lucky Chang's I passed out in the cab.  mmmgood times.  

so, i guess that's the biggest stuff.  work's coming along nicely and the band is shaping up as well.  hope the good times last.

the band's coming along nicely.  i'm getting more comfortable, and singing is less of an embarrassment.  it's still hard to play and sing some songs at the same time, but that'll come.  i'm excited for when we start gigging.  maybe i'll try to get some shows in mass!  it'd be fun to play the worcest...or boston, even.  

ha, did i tell yous, i met a chick from WPI?  maybe i said something.  don't remember.  She graduated in '03.  haven't seen her since i met her, cause i'm just SO cool...hee.  whatever-

i'm going out for drinks after work today.  i don't like being ""celebrated"", makes me uncomfortable to be so...focused on (guess that's why i'm in a band).  anyway being focused on doesn't suck as long as i'm not there focusing on you focusing on me.  performing is different, i'm performing, not just ""celebrating myself"".  ok enough of that.  

i hope you're all doing well.  i'm going to go try to catch up on posts.

"event","so, i gave my ""week and a half"" notice today.  i'm a little shaky.  giving notice sucks, especially here.  i was the best receptionist they had and i feel bad for leaving, but what, i'm going to do this for the rest of my life?  right!  i'm taking an 83% pay cut for this ""carrer move"".  it'll jump up to a pay increase once i start getting clients and there are bonuses and stuff, but that's 2-8 weeks from my start date.  I'd wanted to go to cali between jobs, but i don't think that's going to happen.  tickets now are about $400 and if i swing that i won't really have any money when i'm not making any.  so, i don't know.  i think i want to just jump right in without any vacation.  my last day at the bank is the 5th.  i'm thinking i might start with Equinox on the 7th.  

it's a little sad leaving IXIS. i'm giving up free, paid lunch, really nice people, and a pretty nice little pay check.  i am gaining more in the long run though...it's weird cause i don't really work here anymore, but i do.  no one really knows i'm leaving except my site manager and my agency rep.  there are some people i'm going to miss seeing but can't really ask for their information because we weren't even really ""work friends"" we just chatted to make the day go by faster i guess is what it is.  i would have liked to stay on and get to know some people better...i guess i'll make new friends at the gym where i get a free membership, so i get to take yoga and boxing and spinning classes.  i get a discount on the spa and food bar and clothing store.  and it's right in grand central station so it's like a 10 minute train ride home.  it's a good thing.  so, i guess that's that.  i quit today!  i've been waiting for this day.  i was hoping it'd feel better than it does, but really i'm just a little nervous and sad.  but yeah, i'm excited too-"

JOB:
tomorrow i've my second interview with Equinox.  it's a pretty upscale gym here in the city.  they've them in cali, one in CT, florida...anyway, yeah.  tomorrow i've my second interview to be a personal trainer for them.  if i get hired, i'm hoping to quit the bank and start training.  it sucks big time because i'll be taking a 50% pay cut, but i'll be able to exercise all day and once i start getting clients, i'll be making more than i am at the bank.  my hours won't be the same everday which is cool cause i've still got drs' appointments to make, and i haven't even picked up my passport yet.  probably didn't tell you bout that either.  well, i'm officially french now.  i've got an ID to prove it and my passport's waiting for me at the consulate.  

GIRLS: nothing much of interest there.  i did take a chick home on friday, but that's really all there is to say about that:o)

BAND:
I don't know where i left you, but i believe i said i was auditioning for a band or something along those lines.  well, i'm in the band now.  we're called Illusion of Control.  we're a three piece.  I'm the bassist and i sing vocals.  can you believe it?  well, yeah.  Erik is the guitarist.  he's also lead singer.  Nick is the drummer.  Our sound is hard to describe especially since right now i'm just learning their old songs, and we haven't written one together yet.  I did give Erik some lyrics but he hasn't given us the music yet and so i haven't yet had to really come up with a bassline.  we're still just rehearsing, but i'll let you know when we start playing shows...or maybe i won't remember to live journal, so you should keep our myspace page on file: www.myspace.com/illusionofcontrol.  we'll have a web page too but we don't have pix or mp3s yet so the internetness of us is a bit lame.

we had some friends from tahiti over and that was cool.  

i joined columbia house's dvd club and i now own debs.  it's a wonderful thing cause i'm still in heart with jordana.  

being in the band has made me realize how much i want to be a screen actress.  i'd kind of given it up after the shittiness that was clark theater, but fuck, i'm in new york now.  maybe i can audition a bit if i get this job with Equinox.  Or maybe it'll just be my unlived dream

hope you're all chillin'

i'm thinking batman begins tomorrow.  a nice blunt and some bat action sounds nice to me...though a chick would be nicer.

i'm looking forward to pride even though i'm like dyke repellent.  

the news made me cry this morning.  i've been boarderline all day.  i don't know why, but i've wanted to cry for about a month or so...maybe longer, i'm not sure.  

i don't want to go to taekwondo tonight, but it will probably help me, and if not emotionally, i need it physically.  it'll be good to focus on something other than my thoughts.  

as far as i can tell people have been having a rough time this month.  i think July will be better.

it seems i have GERD (acid reflux disease).  it may be H. Pylori (a bacteria) but prolly not.  i go back to the Dr. a week from tomorrow to get my test results.  if it IS GERD, it's chronic (haha chronic) and i have to take a little purple pill every day for the rest of my life.  it's actually a good thing because now i have to be even more healthy.  i can no longer ingest caffeine and i've actually seen an increase in my alertness.  i can't allow myself to get full, which is really hard because i suck down food like a homeless person, but it's good because i just eat all day long.  i can't eat right before i go to bed which sucks because i can't eat before taekwondo and i sometimes get home with an hour before bed, but in all, it's ok.  i got two calls from the dr i saw about a year ago though, saying that i need to schedule a check up visit, but i've already got one for next saturday.  i dunno.  

i went to the play my mom's friend stage managed.  it put both me and her to sleep.  it was pretty good.  the acting was really good, but it was just too long and not active enough.  there was a LOT of partial nudity, mosly girls.  can't complain about that, but it was 2+ hour long show with no intermission.  it's nice to get out though.

tonight i go to see this band.  the guitarist and drummer are leaving and want to start somethign new.  i may be a part but it depends on how bad i suck...maybe i've posted this.  whatever.  that's tonight.  after taekwondo at harlem, laura and i are going to CBGB to check em out.

tomorrow saana and erica come into the city.  we're going to nation.  OH, speaking of nation, they found my cell phone.  I'm glad, cause i was able to check my numbers, but they were correct anyway...the ones i wasn't sure about.  i'm going to continue using the one scal gave me, but when (and you know i will) i lose that one, i'll have the LG.  

i think what i really wanted to post, and got away from, is that although i have a really hard time living in the city, i'm thinking that i won't be able to live anywhere else.  my best bet is prolly to move to brooklyn...maybe queens and to not work in midtown.  at least i'm not at rockefeller plaza..."

i got absolutely, positively wasted on saturday night.  mary came into the city and we were supposed to take it easy.  i always forget that i don't have the same tolerance as she, and her taking it easy is still me getting fucked up beyond belief.  so, yup, yay, wonderful, i lost my fucking cell phone again.  i was ok, would have been fine if it wasn't for that long island iced tea we got to ""share"" at Nation.  Course by share i mean me, downing it.  And then I was done.  It's disgusting.  Hungover doesn't even begin to describe the state I was in yesterday.  

rediculous.

pascal's around.  lucky bastid's is on summer vacation.  ok, can we just talk about this for a second?  Summer...what the fuck is with this shit?  All of a sudden it's 87 degrees for the whole damend week.  The city's got its great, humid blanket on and i want to die. 90 tomorrow.  thanks, yeah, nice spring, and i have to wear work clothes all the time.  now it's not even like i <i>should</i> go shopping for a new wardrobe.  I fucking have to.  

i don't know if i want to sit through the summer at this job.  i really don't want to have to buy all new work clothes.  And even if i <i>did</i> feel like buying new work clothes, i know i don't feel like dressing like a friggin flower every day of the week.

i have to go see a doctor.  there have been too many signs telling me i need to go or else i'm going to end up in the hospital.  i need a wife.  i don't know why i can't just do things on my own, but i can't.  i know that going to see a dr. will only mean that i have to go back.  initiating anything will only cause MORE action on my part.  It's not like I can go to the dr., find out what's wrong, and then have it end there.  after i go, i'm going to have to deal with treating whatever the fuck is up.  in addition, i really don't want to take time off from work.  

i'm so fucking weak.  

On a lighter note, my promotion test went well.  I was still sick (another reason I didn't want to drink so much) and that didn't help things, but i performed well on my test.  

i really hope my phone is at nation.  i don't know if i deserve to retrieve it, but i hope i do.  there are so many numbers on there that i don't have anywhere else.  

fucking a, something's got to change.

"event","went to CT.  it was really nice.  we were four again, mary, erica and me...cause there was Dee, mary's friend from the gym.  I like 4.  it's good.  

we went to alchemy saturday night.  i nailed a boy in the back seat of his car.  he was actually cute, actually foreign and actually big.  it was finally a decent experience.  white boys are stoopid.  yay for latinos.  no, i'm not straight.  it wasn't hot.  it was just fun.

sunday we tried to club again, but everything was beat so we just hit around the park and went back to mary's for some munchies and family guy.  fucking dark as shit assed fairfield scared the hell out of us when we were out walkin' around and someone's automatic timer went off and we thought it was some kind of rabbid animal.  dee, mary and i booked it down the street and erica was left sucking wind.  it was the kind of thing that was absolutely hilarious...when you're floating through the park.  

monday was nice and relaxed.  hit up a barbeque and then just went home to chill.  all in all.  pretty great weekend.

this weekend will take place in new york.  i've a promotion test for my second degree red belt and i'm hoping mary'll be there and then to celebrate.

bro gets in tomorrow.  he's going to brazil on monday, so i should be able to put up with him for, what is that, 72 hours?  let's hope so.  let's also fucking hope i get to nail a <b>chick</b> this weekend around.

later, bitchez,

"event","So, I went to Worcester this weekend.  It fucking rocked.  It wasn't perfect, but it was excellent.  I saw a lot, A LOT, of people.  It was nice until I had to run away and hide during night under the stars.  I saw the ex.  It was so good to see her.  She looks great.  This was the most relaxing weekend I've had in a long time.  It's funny that Worcester relaxed me, but anything's calmer than New York City.  I'd really like to go back this weekend.  I forgot my towel at Nikki's, plus she's leaving for Spain in like a week.  I'd like to see her one last time, plus Tracy's gonna be up there.  Last year was just graduation; I knew a lot of people staying in the area, so it wasn't really the end.  This, though, <i>IS</i> the end.  There's not really any but a couple people left.  I'm really done with college now.  I want to stay a part of Clark, so I think I'm going to join some Alumni Association thing, but it's not the same.  I'm glad this weekend left me with a good taste in my mouth.  Maybe I'll see you Clarkies for 5 years...and maybe I'll end up moving back to Worcester :O but I doubt it :D"

ok, question, why is 6 feet under the best show ever?  cause it so is!  

i want to get out of here, but once i leave it's all walking to taekwondo and my heels are so not having any of it.  i don't really know what i'm going to do especially since i have to rush to get to class by 6 so i can (not really) assist class.  the promotion test is two weeks from saturday and i finally got my stripes, but i've yet to complete my sparring or assisting requirements. fuck.

"event","so i just stalked the hell out of the ex, but just a little, really...checked the LJ and website.  Finally saw some pictures of the ""zit-infested cabbage"".  He looks alright.  He looks like a nice guy.  He looks like a total dork, but he looks like he prolly treats her really well.  It's funny.  I got a little nauseous, but it's ok.  I'm not bitter.  It's a little rough, of course, cause I'm single, but I don't want to be in a relationship.  I think I'm still at the point where I'd sabotage it.  I can't believe I'm going back to Clark on Friday.  I could see her.  I'd like to, but it still doesn't seem like she's changed that much.  She's probably not thinking about me though.  Hopefully she's not still pissed at me.  Fuck, it's been a year.  Anyway, I'm excited.  There're mad people I'm gonna see.  It's like vacation.  Work's been boring, but ok.  I've decided to become a personal trainer.  I've decided to take the test in November, that gives me about 6 months to study.  I need to get a job in a gym.  I threw up a resume on monster.  Maybe i'll give in some calls at work tomorrow.  I don't want to quit my job at the bank though...good monies right thurr, so they (the gym)'d have to be ok with me doing a night and weekends kind of a dealie, but then there's taekwondo...so yeah, but yay...future:)

...remember that girl kristina?  she's from like 9 months ago...went out with her to a bar to watch the world series, puke out her car...yeah.  too bad, cause she's a personal trainer.  woulda been great to still be in touch with her.  ha, whatcha gonna do, right?

right...and then there was that teakwondo friend over whom i was driving myself insane...things are better now.  things just..are- now.  they'll work out as they should.  anyway, she made me stay in with her last night and watch a movie.  it was nice.  i would have liked to go to nation, but it was a nice time.  she made us dinner...pasta.  we watched the banger sisters.  sometimes she's cute.  sometimes she's just like the ex.  oh, girls.  man, they make the world go round.  love em.

laters.

ps. season finale of Lword.  shedding a little tear while at the same time wishing the show was actually good...:o/

oh shit, pps.  ordered some books from the literary guild...one of 'em, a lezzie book...yeah, hott! later."

"event","i just reread my last post and, wow, i've really gotta restate my virgin question.  

I was wondering on a personal, not social, level.  I'm see though, that if people have these ""personal assumptions"" about by what age a woman should have lost her virginity, then it's a social problem regardless of whether it's in the open or not.  So, no one should think there is an age, however,  that does not mean that they don't.  I just feel like at some point in a woman's life she should start to open herself up intimately to other people.  I feel that falling in love, getting hurt, putting yourself back together, and growing is a big part of life.  Maybe I meant more than just sex.  I guess I mean the whole package.  I mean, where do you draw the line at ""late bloomer"" and something more?"

i'm supposed to have a crush on this girl from taekwondo, but it just makes me feel stupid and mad.  this whole week's been sucking.  nothing's really ""bad"", just a pain, more like.  I've been training as much as I can and will probably be at Taekwondo for 3 hours again tonight.  I'm not liking my schedule, but there isn't really much else I can do, except whine to everybody I know who isn't involved in it.  My troubles are so trivial and yet they are so able to beat me down.  I feel weak and inadequate, vulnerable.  I feel like I'm slipping into a life that will soon run off without me if I'm not careful, and I'm quite possibly not.  Oh what fucking bullshit that is.  You see how I am?  I'll wake up soon.  I'd fucking better.  

What's making me happy, right now, at this very moment, is only that I've ordered chili with rice for lunch.  Pathetic, but it's ok.  I complain, but it's ok.  My life is ok.  There's so much about it that makes me want to crawl under a rock, and it's ok.  I can't be who I should be and actually feel sorry for myself.  So, I whine?  I don't expect sympathy.

"event","so, this was going to be an e-mail then I realized that she probably doesn't care about reading this.  Or maybe she does, but it'd probably turn into some big thing and that's not what this is about.

I know it's been a while since i've posted for real, and this is how i post, well...whatever.  you wouldn't read if you didn't want to-

I've been training pretty well in Taekwondo.  I could be training harder, so I <i>should</i> be training harder, so I feel like shit.  I feel like I'm not ever going to be able to be good enough for myself...in anything, not just Taekwondo.  I have to be happy with just trying my best, but my best is to attempt perfection.  I know I can't <b>be</b> perfect, but I can try.  I'm going crazy.  And I don't even <i>try</i> to be perfect 100% of the time, so it's even worse because I'm not trying my best.  

Are you supposed to try to be perfect 100% of the time?  

So, I think that's what's behind what I'd really wanted to say, which is just that after Taekwondo I feel a little like shit...mentally; physically I feel pretty great, plus I'm in a locker room with all these girls who probably think I'm weird.  God, there's no place to say this shit.  Why haven't I gotten a therapist?  Why can't I push myself harder?  I just need to push myself harder.  I need to think about it all the time and just fucking do it.  Goddamn.

But, I had a great weekend.  saturday was the new york state taekwondo association tournament.  i got silver in forms and gold in sparring.  It was fun and then that night a friend from Taekwondo and I went to a birthday party that a friend of mine from Jr High was having.  Then we went to Krispy Kreme and brought home the bag full of doughnuts they threw out.  The idea was to hand them out along the way home, but there weren't many people out due to the rain and those out didn't want our doughnuts.  Then I spent the night at her house.  It was a great night.  

I'm sorry, I could go on writing all night, but I don't want to bore you all.  

good night.

ps.  Have y'all seen my girl in D.E.B.S. yet? :o)  i can't say it's worth 10 bucks, but i can say she makes a mighty fine lesbian."

"event","like the only place i can come bitch about momements of weakness when i let sinister thoughts of the ex creep in.  i guess that's how it's got to be now.  she doesn't get a name anymore.  i was all stalking people on friendster cause i was stalking people on google and becky was all ""you call yourself a stalker and you didn't even stalk her on friendster or facebook?"" (talking about someone i was stalking) so, i went to stalk her on friendster (where she isn't) after she i found she isn't on facebook and i figured it would be harmless to check if the ex'd updated her profile.  looks like she has.  also looks like she's got her hair longer again...i always liked it better that way.  also looks like she thinks her boyfriend is hot.  i guess that'd be a requirement.  i've heard otherwise, but you know how people are :oD  So, it made me a little sick to see her profile, but it also passed fairly quickly, and it also seems like she hasn't changed much, which is kind of sad.  I hope she's happy where she is though.  She'll be done with clark so soon, in like 2 months i think.  i wonder where she's going.  it'd be sad NEVER to speak to her again, but...i think that's how things work.  


on a lighter note, DEBS premierd on Friday.  I didn't go see it.  I know, I KNOW!  I'm ashamed.  I don't know when i'll get to go though.  It's not playing everywhere and i'm going to be taekwondoing a pretty good amount this week.  We've got the New York State tournament next saturday and I haven't been to a sparring class yet, so I'm going to have to bust ass this week.  

i went to CT for easter.  I was supposed to see Mary and Erica, but that didn't work out.  Saturday night I hung out with two people from Taekwondo instead and that was a lot of fun.  We watched videos of competitions and talked and stuff.  It was great excpet that the dude wanted(wants) pretty hardcore to get into the girl's pants.  I don't think he'll be successful, but ya never know with kids these days.

ok, lovers.

"event","hello dahlings,

haven't been around in a while...haven't had much to say i guess. 

yesterday i had my promotion test for Taekwondo.  I did well, but could have done much better, so I'm disappointed, but, meh, it's in the past.  We'll just go from here.

I'm sick and that makes things worse.  L word IS on tonight, though, so that's got a smile on my face.  If you haven't seen season II and can, you should definately check out Carmen.  Very hot.  Sarah Shahi.  She's Iranian, came outa Texas.  She was a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and has been featured in Maxim.  And that's enough about her.  Shane's looking good and...hahaha, have any of you seen The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love?  Well, the tomboy-dyke is Tina.  It's weird to see her in such a different role, but it helps me appreciate Holloman's performance on the L word...Ok, so enough about that.

I bought a pair of pants yesterday.  I'm pleased with them.  They aren't jeans and they kinda fit.  They're not for work, but they're good.  I totally need more work clothes, but I just hate shopping for them.  They have to be more perfect and really fit and clothes usually don't on me, so it's a lot more fun to shop for weekend clothes.  They don't really have to be much more than comfortable.  

Ok, so I guess that's that.  I haven't been doing much by way of going out.  Seems like I've been getting sick every other weekend, so I'm just enjoying resting on the weekend.  I just bought Knuckle Down and it should be here in a week or two.  I'm excited for that.

Take care y'alls.  Can't wait for spring.

ps.  Jess, I want to send you a letter, but I don't know if you're still at the Denver address you gave me.  Let me know peeze?

"event","I went to Worcester this weekend.  It was pretty cool.  Saturday was my B-day and we (Anna, Sally, Alyssa, Amanda, Matt, Drew, Kimmi, Warren, Ben, and Beth) went to Mohegan Sun.  Sally's b-day's this week and Amanda's was a week ago.  It was fun.  I lost 20 bucks.  We played slots.  The boys played some tables too.  I'd like to go to Foxwoods and get to play some roulette...

Friday We'd gone to a party at Matt's then we went to a party at Nikki's.  Tracy was there.  It was nice to see her.  I hadn't seen her since the 5 minutes I caught her and Becca at graduation.  I saw Jenny at Nikki's and that's always a good time.  Rom was there with her doggie Tyrone and that was cute.  I want a pup.  

Sunday we, Anna and I, went to Clark's presentation of the Vagina Monologues.  Becca Dezan did the CUNT skit and this chick Anna likes was in it too.  It was actually a good production.  I was pleased.  Then Sunday night we watched the L Word.  There's a new, hot girl on there.  I'm please.  Shane fucked her and I think she starts fucking Jenny later.  

So, that was my weekend.  Monday I came back into the city.  I never realized what being here does to my mood.  Y'all know how people piss me off?  Well, there are just so damned many in New York City.  25% less people everywhere I go would make this the greatest city in the world.  That or I could just have an invisible field around me that no one could enter.  That would rock.

"event","""Tu t'habilles comme un garcon et on a l'impression que t'es toujours preete a la bagarre.  T'as tout le temps les manche de ta chemise ou de ton blouson retroussees.  Le mec se dit qu'avec toi, meme si t'es attirante, il n'aura pas le dernier mot et que s'il a une parole de travers, tu lui flanqueras des baffes.  celui qui a des intentions serieuses se dit qu'a la maison, tu seras bien capable de lui mettre un tablier et de le laisser a la cuisine en tete a tete avec les marmites.  Et puis, tout le monde sait que t'as une petite preference pour les Europeens.  T'aimes pas beaucoup les types de chez nous.  Tu ne sais que les fusiller du regard.  Pour toi, ce sont tous des faux jetons qui passent leur temps a battre leur femme et a empecher leurs soeurs de respirer.  T'aimes pas trop te risque avec ces gars-la.  Et puis, tu fais une fixation sur le mari de ta soeur, le type qui se fait servir par sa femme, qui va voir les putes, mais assez hypocrite et malin pour passer aux teux de la famille pour un homme bien...Il faut reconnaitre que tu ne fais pas beaucoup d'efforts.  Tu devrais de temps en temps oter ton jean, tes baskets, ton blouson de casseuse.  Bon, tu peux ne pas te maquiller, c'est pas grave, tu n'en as pas besoin, mais si tu mettais un jour un peu de khol autour de tes yeux, ca ne gacherait rien.  Et puis, sois moins brusque, prends le temps de respirer, de jouer, et meme de ne rien faire!  T'es trop serieuse.  C'est bien de refuser la galere, c'est meme tout a ton honneur, mais arrete de t'esquinter.  Regarde, tu portes ton blouson comme si c'etait un voile: on ne voit pas tes formes, je ne sais meme pas si tes seins son petits ou gros, si tes hanches sont larges ou etroites.  Tu marche comme sur un ring.  Arrete-toi un peu, regarde-toi dans une glace, pose tes fesses sur une chaise, pense a la douceur et a la legerete de l'existance!  T'es pas dans la galere.  Profites-en!  Des raisins, il y en a.  Tu as merite de les cueillir.  Sors de ta reserve, oblie tes prejuges.  Tous les Arabes ne sont pas comme le mari de ta soeur!  Tu ne serais pas un peu raciste, des fois?  Meme pas: tu ne laisseras jamais quelqu'un maltraiter un Arabe.  Mais t'en veux pas dans ta propre vie.  C'est ton droit.  Peut-etre mem que t'as raison.  Mais sois un peu plus souple!  C'est une forme d'intelligence de savoir vivre avec les autres.  Toi, tu as choisi:  tu te bats tout le temps.  Tu ne veux surtout pas qu'on t'assimile a cette generation perdue.  Si tu ne tiens pas en place, c'est pour vivre debout, et avancer, avancer...""

so, yeah.  i used to hate television.  i hated everything that it was.  i was one step away from pasting a ""kill your television"" bumper sticker to my car.  Now it's my best friend.  And so, money.  I hate money.  I hate all that it stands for.  I still know that I need it though.  I know what it means in this country and that it is coveted.  I think it's better to have the money that people covet than to covet it.  I don't know if i'm saying anything here.  i just understand what money can do or does do to people.  just because i hate it and don't feel that i need it doesn't mean that i'm not going to have it.  i know what it takes to live in this society, and money is part of it.

"event","1 year and 3 days= the belated anniverary of our break up.
4 years and 3 days = the belated would be 4 year anniversary.

What do you do with things like this?  I'm just back from lunch where these facts kinda hit me.  It's really more of a ""making a big deal out of not such a big deal"" type of thing, still a little sad though.  

Yeah, we broke up on our 3 year anniversary.  It's kind of her trademark, to break up on ""special"" days.  So, Jan 31, is our golden day. 2 weeks from Valentines day, 2.5 weeks from my birthday, beginning of a new semester, new year...seemed just right.  Hell, why drag something out, anyway?

I really didn't want to go into a whole mess about this.  I just wanted to leave a little mark.  I got the urge to stalk her LJ, but I don't think I will.  There's nothing for me in there, if anything it would only upset me.  I like where I am.  It's funny.  I can see myself...I can see where I am now, where I was when I was with her, where I was months ago, even.  It's nice to be in this building stage of my life.  When people talk about being happy with yourself and how relationships clog the vision and you need to love yourself, yadayada, who knows what the fuck they're talking about?  You don't, until you do.  I guess that's where I am now.  I'm in this self-realising, progressive state.  It's kind of fucking wonderful.  I've so many issues still, but we'll push through.  Yesterday, I spent $108 on face shit.  I'll be going back for a facial and spending another $100.  I know, what has ""the real world"" done with ""the real"" Marannie?

<u>So, state of the union?</u>
I watched it (with a few breaks for Jordana).  Bush does a great job.  He's exactly who they want him to be.  I can't believe he hasn't been impeached.  Clinton lies about getting sucked off and he gets impeached.  Bush lies about friggin' weapons of mass destruction and he doesn't get impeached.  What the hell are the democrats doing right now?  It's kind of fun to watch all this go down.  You know that the East is going to rise and bring the West down, not out, but still down; it's inevitable.  I enjoy following the chain of events that lead to our demise.  

My dad's in town for a show in the Javits center.  Vanessa Williams came to his booth.  Pretty cool.  Too bad I wasn't there.  I like looking at pretty women ;oD.

SUPERBOWL on Sunday.  I'm thinking of going to a bar to watch the game.  I don't want to just sit home.  that's kinda lame and I'll get bored and won't watch.  So, there're people at work putting in a pool, I THINK it's for the Superbowl.  What the hell for, man?  The Pats are gonna win.  Why bet on the Eagles?  Whatever, I don't bet, not my deal. 

I always end up writing a friggin' book on this trash.  Sorry, guys.  Hope you're all enjoying the winter.  Yay for yay.  

goodnight, lovers."

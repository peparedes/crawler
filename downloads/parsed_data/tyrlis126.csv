"event","So, despite everything that's been going on recently, my birthday was okay. I got roses and a nice cake for my birthday. I got money and a digital camera (yay!). So, all in all, not a bad haul. Most excitingly however, was that my bag came in the mail. So, yes,&nbsp;despite my many years of holding out, I finally bought a&nbsp;Vera Bradley&nbsp;bag (in the Windsor Navy pattern, if you're curious). Well, to&nbsp;be more accurate, I bought my Villager bag which I use for&nbsp;school and my zip wallet last&nbsp;November. Of course, by the time I realized that I absolutely loved my bag and its pattern, the pattern had retired. =_=; So,&nbsp;I had ordered a small handbag on&nbsp;eBay&nbsp;and it arrived yesterday! It's so cute! 

But now, I had another dilemma. My Villager tote's not big enough to hold my new laptop (named Leon after Leon&nbsp;Magnus from ToD&nbsp;^_^ ) so, I was looking for a bigger bag. I thought I couldn't go to the&nbsp;Vera Bradley website since the pattern was retired, but I went anyway and found that it's only listed as ""retiring soon"" so they still had it in stock. And I got a 25% discount and free shipping because it's a&nbsp;""retiring soon"" pattern. Yay! 

Now, only problem is that they still have everything listed&nbsp;in that pattern on the site, and I saw another few things that caught my eye (the small Tic Tac Tote and the Small Bow Cosmetic Bag) but to buy those two would be another $50-$60&nbsp;in addition to the $67 I spent on the Miller bag already.&nbsp;I'm trying desperately to hold out. Lol. Wish me luck! My mood&nbsp;this week will depend whether or not I buy it lol. Anyway, when my&nbsp;new bag comes in, I'll take pictures of my mini collection with my&nbsp;*~* new*~* Digital camera! ^_^ 

Anyway, on a more serious note,&nbsp;pharmacy school has decided to turn annoying now.&nbsp;While the stuff we're doing in compounding lab&nbsp;is cool, having lab at 8:30 am before a full afternoon of classes is most decidedly not lol. And Kinetics...let's not even go there. Okay, never mind, let's go there since I need to rant and get this off my chest lol. First of all, we're a distance site for this&nbsp;class...most decidedly not cool mostly because the professor refuses to speak clearly into the mike, and he doesn't seem to get the fact that he has to focus the document camera so that we can see the handouts he's showing us&nbsp;lol. Anyway, hopefully it'll get better. I tried studying the first&nbsp; couple chapters on my own, and, though it's doable, I sincerely hope I don't have to do the entire course on my own.&nbsp; 

Oh well, I got the PSP version of Disgaea and Radiant Mythology (which I'd had&nbsp; for a while but had stopped playing) to keep me company during kinetics."

I had woken up the previous morning at about 6 am for compounding lab at 8, and had to wake up again this morning at 6 again for my EPE site (this after not being able to fall asleep overnight). Regardless, the dread had nothing to do with the fact that I was already dead tired at the start of a very long day. Rather, it had more to do with the realization that, once I start working, this was probably how I was going to feel every day, and I can't help feeling that I'd lost something important--something other than sleep.<br /><br />I mean, after all this time, after everything, is this all I have to look forward to? Is this my ""end""? Have the credits rolled? Could it be that all that's left for me is a life so meaningless that it's consigned to the realm of invisible mediocrity?<br /><br />To tell the truth, I don't care about my life very much in the sense that I don't see any meaning in it. And when I say meaning, I don't mean it in the sense that there's some kind of grand plan orchestrated by some Being out there somewhere. I mean it in the sense that I just don't really care about anything that I'm doing--that I always feel how I felt this morning--as though I were constantly thinking ""If only I could make it through this day"". I feel that's what I've been thinking all my life--but for what?&nbsp; Just to live a meaningless life that will constantly leave me thinking that exact same thing?<br /><br />I would like to say that I refuse to accept it, but I see no alternative at the moment--not because I don't have a choice, but rather because I doubt I could find meaning in anything anymore. I just...don't see anything as worthwhile anymore, and I don't even feel like putting in the effort to pretend I care.<br /><br />I just...want to go somewhere isolated where no one knows me, no one expects anything of me.

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Lawful Neutral</b> A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs him. Order and organization are paramount to him. He may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or he may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government. Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot. However, lawful neutral can be a dangerous alignment because it seeks to eliminate all freedom, choice, and diversity in society.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are known for their poetry, song, and magical arts, but when danger threatens they show great skill with weapons and strategy. Elves can live to be over 700 years old and, by human standards, are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. Elves are slim and stand 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall. They have no facial or body hair, prefer comfortable clothes, and possess unearthly grace. Many others races find them hauntingly beautiful.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Druids</b> gain power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. They hate the unnatural, including aberrations or undead, and destroy them where possible. Druids receive divine spells from nature, not the gods, and can gain an array of powers as they gain experience, including the ability to take the shapes of animals. The weapons and armor of a druid are restricted by their traditional oaths, not simply training. A druid's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast.

And like Saturn, to really be able to understand you, someone delve beyond your appearance.

You are not an easy person to befriend. However, once you enter a friendship, you'll be a friend for life.

"event","Watched all of Tenpou Ibun Ayakashi Ayashi today.&nbsp;I'd had the thing for a while, just never sat&nbsp;down to watch it. It was a pretty interesting series. The idea of wanting to leave this world for another struck me pretty hard. I'd always felt out of place among people, distanced myself from them. ""I'm not like them; I&nbsp;can't be like them"". Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. I&nbsp;don't know. Maybe my thoughts and feelings have taken form in a sense just like the youi and changed me into something from which I can't return. Maybe it's a good thing, maybe a bad thing.&nbsp;I can't tell.

We're all humans living on this world; there is no difference between us.

Maybe that's the case, but I refuse to believe it. Everything else I've ever known has told me to&nbsp;fight against the inevitable, and in this case the inevitable was that&nbsp;I am forced to live only in this world. This was the first series I'd ever seen that was so fatalistic. It is utterly&nbsp;impossible for me to believe now that this is the only way things could be, that this is the only choice. I've chosen this path to find a world that I can exist in, and I have acknowledged that this is not the one. Perception creates the world; without it, there would be no defined ""reality"". Hell, all reality is is what the majority of people agree this world should be.

But this world is not the&nbsp;end. I know it.&nbsp;

I have heard something stirring at its core: something I cannot even put into words.

Just like the characters in the story, I have seen the other world&nbsp;and can no longer be satisfied with this one. Or, put more accurately, I no longer have to ""just put up"" with this one.

This thing...I seek it, I chase it more than any other thing in this life. I want to clasp it in my hands, embrace it, understand it. Whatever it is, even the slightest taste I've had of it fulfills me more than anything in this world ever could. And its filled, somehow, with the feeling of regret. Whether regret that I did not come to know this sooner, or regret that I came to know it at all, I cannot tell.

I have said once before that I would turn my back on this world. Of that, I am now certain more than ever. My path is out there, to chase that world I once had seen. And I know that it is not a crime to want to return there because I'm not returning because it would be an easier life, or because I want to run away from this world but, perhaps, because it is my dream to find it--the place I am to go to next.&nbsp;

I feel as Drosselmeyer must have felt. ""This story is over; it's time to move on to the next one"". I feel as though I've accomplished here what I must, and that it is yet again time to move on to whatever is next in pursuit of that other world.&nbsp;

I realize now that i'vee always been in search of an other, whether it was another person or another world, it just depended on the time of&nbsp; my life. I'm not searching for a reason to exist; I'm just searching for a place. The never-ending search for that place--that is the meaning of my existence."

"event","Lately, I've become aware of just how jaded&nbsp;I am.&nbsp;The realization comes courtesy of a new game I've been playing called Ar Tonelico. It's not the best game I've ever played, almost far from it in fact as I find it&nbsp;difficult to appreciate a game that&nbsp;chock full of innuendoes&nbsp;in every nook and cranny (come on,&nbsp;Installing Grathnode Crystals? Yeah right,&nbsp;what the hell do you think of when a girl says to a guy ""It hurts when you push it in""?"")<br /><br />At any rate, there was this scene that was&nbsp;supposed to be all fluffy and romantic where the male lead essentially confesses his loved for&nbsp;one of the female leads (excuse me while&nbsp;I go vomit). Normally, I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff, but I find that now, I can't wait to bypass those scenes and just get around to kicking the bad guy's ass, or, in fact, any ass that happens to be hanging around while I'm&nbsp;in a bad mood.<br /><br />The one&nbsp;recent exception is&nbsp;Fire Emblem, in which the relationships are usually well crafted, and, oddly enough, Soul Nomad, in which one of the possible relationships&nbsp;involves the main character being paired off with a foul-mouthed,&nbsp;psychopathic, meglomaniacal god of death who had, two centuries before,&nbsp;tried to destroy the entire known universe. Now <em>that</em> I find interesting.&nbsp;<br /><br />But what I find even more interesting about that pairing is that the two are equally (?) capable characters--well, at least as equally capable as one can be with a former god of death. Though at first it seems like the female lead has no personality (mostly because she doesn't talk), it turns out later that that's far from the truth; she actually had a well established personality, it just kind of paled compared to the other characters' personalities which were blown so far out of proportion. But what I like about the MC is that she's a strong character who can hold her own in a battle, has power and isn't afraid to kick ass and take names of her own accord. But, at the same time she's also kind and considerate of her own accord and not because someone else told her to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />And furthermore, despite all the characteristics of the male lead that I listed above, he's refreshingly independent minded. After all, he hardly conforms to the stereotypical role of the hero who is always good, always does the right thing and is always utterly clueless about relationships (though, I think the the last would apply to a god of death as well, for some reason). He's rude, selfish, and doesn't think twice about wiping out anything that stands in his way, but you know, it's refreshing to have a character like him ,especially in comparison to the the male MC of Ar Tonelico who can't seem to make up his mind about anything.<br /><br />Well, at any rate, I've totally forgotten where this rant was going. I guess I'll have to pick it up when I remember."

I ripped it to shreds, reclaiming it precious piece by precious piece, and when I&nbsp; was done, when I had succeeded, I simply never bothered putting it back together. It was too much work--like trying to piece back a glass whose fragments had been ground into sand.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--A character in my head who wouldn't shut up last night while I was trying to fall asleep<br /><br />So, I was talking about Fire Emblem today (Sacred Stones if you care to know) when I was asked a question. Why did I care so much about pairing off the characters if I didn't believe in love? I thought about it for a while, dwelled on it--stalked the question practically before arriving at an answer.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's not that I don't <em>believe</em> in love, per se; I just hate the human version of it. As usual, humans have taken something perfect, something <em>divine</em> and managed to taint it as they have everything else in this world: the land, the water, the air. They have turned it into something that I can never abide--something that they claim only a few deserve.<br /><br />But that is not what <em>I</em> believe, having known for the equivalent of many lifetimes what love actually is--having experienced <em>true </em>love (again, not the <em>human</em> term) for myself--having been loved so completely and totally that anything humankind could offer me could would pale in--no would not even <em>merit</em> comparison.<br /><br />The love <em>I</em> believe in--the love I have seen is something so pure that it cannot be contained--cannot be limited to one person or even a few. It is something that erases the lines of ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"", or maybe it is something blind to those lines in the first place. It is something that overflows, yet, you would not want to ever contain it.</p><p>I often wondered why humans would choose the fire element as their, almost, universal image of love. Why would they choose something that seems so utterly destructive--so fated to consume the very thing that fuels it--something that can only exist with the right kindling? They picked such a limited image that presents but a narrow view on something that is necessarily broad. Just as love cannot be confined to one person, it also cannot be confined to one image. It is not merely the fire that burns everlasting in one's heart! No! It is not only that, but it is as gentle as the wind, as nurturing as the earth and as serene as water itself. It is not somethign that people need to seek, but rather something that exists naturally, all around them.</p><p>But, even as I say this, there is one place where I cannot see love existing--inside humans. I can see mercy, kindness, compassion, but not love. Having seen what they as a race are capable of, I cannot--will not!--say that love as I know it exists within them. Sometimes, they come close--seem almost on the verge of breaking out of that primitive shell they have isolated themselves in and awakening to the world around them; I'm certain that many people even realize that there is a difference. Though a start, however, that alone is not enough. They bind themselves, chain themselves to an idea that confuses love with some mixture of acceptance and lust. But that is not what love is. I cannot think of a word that truly describes love (<em>agape</em> probably comes closest and emphasizes my point that people are marginally aware of what I saying). But still, no single, individual word that can describe the phenomenon of which I speak--this <em>thing</em> which is not an event but a condition.<br /><br />As I live among people, I find myself constantly frustrated and stymied by this lack of understanding. I cannot rightly blame them for it; they are yet young--infantile at best--a young race with childish ideas about the word around them, but there are times that their ignorance tries even <em>my</em> patience. And knowing who I am, I must have plenty of it--patience that is. I say this not out of bitterness nor out of anger but rather, out of exhaustion.<br /><br />Enough. I'm tired of teaching. I'm tired of trying to do this. It is not my role in life to play nursemaid to these children. I have tried, but all my efforts have failed. After all, who could guide&nbsp; those who refuse guidance? It is my turn to refuse--to turn a blind eye, to shut my ears and embrace restful sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />Though I will stay here, for I cannot leave, I will remain neutral as I should have in the beginning. I will live, and I will breathe, but I will no longer endure this burden. Nor can I live in ignorance of this; I would surely die without the knowledge--no the <em>instinct</em> I possess. But I cannot endure it. I'm not certain what I can do. My sub-concious has been whispering the answer to me, but I'm unable to hear it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I feel myself growing ideologically farther and farther away from humanity, but I do not fear it. Perhaps the day I always knew would come has finally come--the day when I take my final steps away and forever divide myself intellectually from the world. It is headed down a path that I cannot follow--in more ways than simply one. Neither my head nor my heart permit me to follow. I feel as though all I can do is watch as they vanish into the distance, knowing that even if I call them back, they will not listen.<br /><br />And so I will eventually stand--a guide without a charge but not without purpose. It is my purpose to know what I know, and I have fulfilled that. It seems that all I can do now is watch and wait because <em>this</em> cannot be stopped.</p>"

"event","So, there seems to be some interesting TV shows this season: 1 for almost every day of the week. My scehdule (aside from school stuff) goes something like this:

Monday: Aliens in America (CW at 8&nbsp;o'clock)
Tuesday: House (Fox at 9 o'clock ^^)
Wednesday: Pushing Daisies (ABC at 8&nbsp;o'clock)

I was surprised by Pushing Daisies.&nbsp;As it turned out, I really liked it despite its, somewhat strange premise. Well, maybe I liked it because of that, its fairytale feel and its just devastating cuteness.&nbsp;

The basic premise was that there was this guy who could bring&nbsp;dead things (and people) back to life&nbsp;if he touched them once, but would kill them if he touched them again after bringing them back. Also, if he didn't re-kill them again within a minute of bringing them back to life, someone in close proximity to them (excluding&nbsp;him, I assume) would die in the original person's place. So, as the story goes, there was this girl he was&nbsp;in love with when he was a kid and he finds out she was murdered. So, he was working with a detective to solve homicide cases by bringing the victim back to life and asking what happened to them) and he ended up bringing her back. Problem was, he didn't kill her again.

As the story goes, the two fell in love (bringing her back to life helped her opinion of him alot I guess) but they can't ever touch or she'd die again.

It's a really sad story, but it's done with this wonderful touch of the absurd, giving the show an overall nice&nbsp;feel.&nbsp;

I'm really happy with this one. I'll probably keep watching it for a while. Now I just need something on&nbsp;Thursday and Friday and I'm good to go! ^^&nbsp;"

"event","""What do you mean, <em>cursed</em>?"" I asked, struggling to keep my voice calm. (After all, when dealing with gods it was often best to keep one's anger in check.)<br /><br />""Before you died,"" he continued, seemingly unmoved, ""someone laid a curse of great power on you. It bound your soul to that world, preventing it from entering the next.""<br /><br />I bit back the frustration that bubbled up in my throat. ""What does that mean? Am I to be a ghost--wandering the world, never to find peace?""<br /><br />For the briefest of moments something akin to pity crossed his perfect face. ""No, child. You are to be reincarnated.""<br /><br />Oh. So it wasn't as bad as I had thought. Maybe...<br /><br />""Under a certain set of conditions,"" he added, quickly.<br /><br />Fear reared its ugly head again. ""And...what would those conditions be?""&nbsp;My words crumbled as I spoke them.<br /><br />If he could have sighed, I'm certain he would have. However, millenia of delivering bad news had made him an expert at this (of that I am sure).&nbsp; Up until now, his reactions had been practiced, controlled. He had never let more than a trace of emotion show. So when he faced me with that pained, almost broken expression, I knew that I was doomed.<br /><br />""You are to become the Bane of Existence.""<br /><br />I did not trust myself to speak, but I tried to anyway--tried to hold myself together, act like it hadn't fazed me. ""The...Bane of...Existence? What is...that?""<br /><br />I knew the words, but had never heard the term itself before.<br /><br />""The Bane of Existence,"" he continued, having regained most of his composure, ""is one of the keys to the end of the world. <em>The</em> key in fact. It alone gives rise to all of the factors that will contribute to Armaggedon.""<br /><br />""So...I'm going to...destroy the world?""<br /><br />""Not exactly. Your existence will only set the world on the path to destruction. You yourself will do nothing that would actually destroy the world, <em>per se</em>.""<br /><br />""But then...what is it I do?"" I burst out, irritated by his matter-of-factness about the whole thing. This <em>was</em> my life we were talking about. A little sympathy wouldn't hurt.<br /><br />""You don't <em>do</em> anything,"" he repeated. ""You simply exist. To the rest of the world, you will come to represent everything that is wrong with it. You will become everything they want yet everything they despise."" He looked at me again, his face a dispassionate mask, but his eyes telling me that he was truly sorry for me. ""Your role,"" he said, ""is to simply be hated by the World.""<br /><br />""Hated?! But why?! Especially if I don't do anything to them!""<br /><br />He looked away, probably disturbed by my outburst. ""It's senseless. I know, but that's the whole point of it. Their hatred will be baseless, senseless and all directed at you. It is--supposed to turn you into a center of negative energy. Someone who is hated and only hates those who hate them. Your energies will be so turbulent, so corrupted that it will inevitably affect the energies of those around you. And since you're a natural empath, the effect will only be multiplied.""<br /><br />The raw wound in my heart ached. I would be hated for simply existing? I looked up at him. Wasn't there anything anyone could do?""<br /><br />""No,"" he said, reading my mind. ""No one can remove this curse. It was inevitable that someone would end up taking on this role. You, just happened to be chosen for it.""<br /><br />""And that gives you the right to torture me like this!"" I burst out, wishing I could ring his neck or break his face or something! Wishing I could just take all the pain and rage that was building inside of me and--<br /><br />But I bit it back, knowing that it was the first manifestation of my curse. It was set to ruin my next life. I wouldn't allow it to ruin my brief stay in Limbo. I swallowed, forcing the burning feeling deep into the pit of my stomach, letting out a breath when I felt it was safe to.<br /><br />""You controlled it,"" he said quietly, almost awed. ""I did not think you would be able.""<br /><br />My gut twisted painfully. ""You...don't know <em>anything</em> about me."" I wheezed.<br /><br />For a moment, he looked like he was about to say something smart, but he seemed to think better of it. ""Perhaps,"" he muttered, ""humans were always the most mysterious of the creatures. Free will and all.""<br /><br />Free will my ass. Here they had practically doomed me by creating the need for this bloody curse in the first place. Tell me. Who else but a sadist would come up with something like this? I had no free will anymore. Damned if I did, damned if I didn't. That was the way things were going to be from now on. What was the point of even fighting anymore?<br /><br />""But, if you're willing to fight it,"" he continued, reading my mind again, ""maybe we can help you.""<br /><br />""How...so?"" I forced out through gritted teeth. ""You already said you couldn't break it.""<br /><br />""We can't,"" he answered matter-of-factly. ""But we can mitigate it, somewhat.""<br /><br />""What do you mean?""<br /><br />""The curse,"" he said, ""was created as a trigger for the end of days. We placed it in the hands of those we deemed worthy with the instructions to activate it when the world was slated to die. This curse would accelerate the destruction, true, but it would also allow us to intervene since the destruction wasn't entirely brought about by free will. Our intervention would allow the world to be reborn after the destruction was complete. The only thing was, none of us expected that, this time, it would be used so soon.""<br /><br />""So soon?"" I asked. ""When was it last used?""<br /><br />He ignored my question. ""We don't really want to have to recreate the world again. It's alot more work than you might think. So, our best bet is to stall the activation of the curse.""<br /><br />""How does that work?""<br /><br />This time, he answered. ""The curse works by making you a center of negative energy. However, you can dispel that negative energy yourself by neutralizing it with positive energy.""<br /><br />""And where am I supposed to find anything positive in this?"" I sneered.<br /><br />""You're not,"" he replied. ""Generally, the curse is supposed to steal all happiness from you to facilitate your generation of negative energy. But, there can be positive energy put in around the curse.""<br /><br />""And how...?""<br /><br />""We'd have to do it.""<br /><br />""...What?""<br /><br />""We'd have to help you,"" he said, realizing I didn't understand.&nbsp;""We'd have to give you an unending source of positive energy.""<br /><br />""And what would that be?""<br /><br />""We will give you what you cannot find in the world. Though you will be hated by all the world, you will be loved by all those outside of it. Though this curse takes the world from you, we will open the doors of the spirit world to you. You will be able to live as none before you have. All you have to do is fight the curse. In exchange, we will bless you and protect you from all harm.""<br /><br />""I'd rather you just break the curse,"" I said.<br /><br />""This is all we can offer you,"" he replied.<br /><br />It was better than nothing I supposed. If he was telling the truth (which it was safe to assume he was) then the curse could not be broken.&nbsp; At least this way, I'd get something out of this whole mess.<br /><br />""Fine,"" I muttered, ""I'll fight it.""<br /><br />He nodded. ""Very well."" He paused, as though listening to something. ""They're ready to reincarnate you now,"" he told me.<br /><br />""Fine.""<br /><br />He listened again. ""Oh, and they tell me to tell you that, when you're reborn, you'll have no memory of anything that happened here.""<br /><br />'Fi--What?! How am I supposed to remember to fight this then?""<br /><br />""That's a promise you made with the gods. It will be instinctual.""<br /><br />""Wait! This isn't--this isn't fair!""<br /><br />""It's the best we can do. Goodbye now.""<br /><br />The doors to the room opened again, and I was unceremoniously ushered through by unseen hands. Out in the corridor, another person bearing the same choker I did waited anxiously. He looked at me curiously.<br /><br />""So, is it true?"" he asked, ""Is this really heaven?""<br /><br />He looked so hopeful that, for a moment, I didn't have it in me to break his heart. But, remembering what I'd just been told...<br /><br />""Don't get your hopes up,"" I snorted. ""There're only devils here.""<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I felt like writing today rather than studying for my healthcare systems test. This is the product of that procrastination and a weird dream I had last night.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I was asked an interesting question today in a most usual way. I was dreaming. In the dream, I was standing on a dock, and an arbiter stood before me. There were two boats docked at the pier, and, for whatever reason, I was allowed to claim one of them as my own.

The arbiter asked me which I would choose. She pointed to the first one. It was a handsome, luxurious yacht, and on it was everything I could ever want that could be bought with money. Apparently that boat came along with a fortune. I liked the boat when I first saw it, but it seemed cold...lifeless somehow.

At that time, the arbiter showed me the second boat. It was absolutely decrepit. It was once a nice shade of blue, but most of the paint had rusted away and the thing didn't even look seaworthy, yet it was floating. It was tiny compared to the yacht--positively microscopic. I wasn't even sure I could stand upright in the thing without hitting my head on the ceiling. In fact, I'm certain there wasn't even a motor on the thing.&nbsp;

I'm standing on the dock with the arbiter, looking at this horrible looking boat and wondering why on earth I would ever be convinced to choose this thing when the arbiter speaks.

She says that she noticed me looking at the decrepit boat, and she warns me that if I were to choose it I would have to sacrifice much.

Now, I'm asking myself, why would I even want to choose this thing?

She continues, saying that I must be willing to take the pressure if I am to choose that boat. That I must be willing to take the blows for the sake of that boat.

Of course, I'm like ""what the hell"" I never said I wanted that boat.

She says that I've been watching it intently. And, that if I absolutely didn't want it, I would have chosen the yacht right off the bat.

I forget what she says next, but she ends up insinuating that the boat represents the passion in my life that I have abandoned and the yacht represents the sensible decisions I have made for the sake of wealth. She said that, though the decision seems obvious, I was not able to abandon my passion for wealth and success.

Then, she demands a decision.

I hesitate.&nbsp;

I then wake before I can answer."

"event","OMG! I got ahold of the first five episodes of the Romeo X Juliet series and OMG! I'm totally hooked! I mean, yeah, I know I'm probably setting myself up to be miserable when I see the end of the series--the thing's already killing me with the angst anyway--but I can't resist!! Ah, Romeo's precious--utterly useless, but precious nonetheless and Juliet just totally kicks ass (when she's not moping around over Romeo that is).&nbsp; 

I really like the changes made for the series. The cast includes characters from lots of different Shakespeare plays as well as a carciature of Shakespeare himself and of course, there's lots of references to the various plays!! I also adore the ryoumas (pegasi basically)! They're sooo freaking awesome! There are alot of changes but much has stayed the same. I think I'm gonna really like this show even if the ending turns out to be sad. 

Of course, I'm still holding out hope for a happy ending, but I know how unlikely that is for this particular story. But, if the ending must be sad, if they must both die I hope it's not in a silly way like in the play. Their deaths in the play were so senseless, and, I suppose that's part of the tragedy, because it was so preventable. But still, if these characters must die, I want their deaths to be meaningful. I also hope that if the writers chose to keep the ending as a tragedy that the two can still die together. I believe that it's cruel to keep one of them alive after the other has died. Is that wrong? I dunno. I guess I'm just kinda getting all bent out of shape about the ending cause I keep aniticipating it as being sad. 

In any case, whatever the ending will be, I'm still gonna hope that it can be happy for both of them. 

Sigh. I'm hopelessly optimistic.&nbsp;"

Your team must consist of the following:

1) Team Leader: Zetta (Makai Kingdom)--who better to motivate a ragtag group than a ""Badass Overlord"" who singlehandedly reduces his own Netherworld to dust and ashes and has to rebuild it from the doghouse up with nothing but a...guess what...ragtag group!

2) Warrior:&nbsp; Conrad Weller (Kyou Kara Maoh)--He's a great character and totally kicks ass with a sword! ^^

3) Smartypants: Jade Curtiss (Tales of the Abyss)--Who better than snippy, sarcastic, smartypants Jade? Well, maybe, House, but still, I choose Jade! Not to mention that Jade's magic is deadly, and he's a first-class spear user&nbsp;as well!

4)&nbsp; Hottie: Jeane (Suikoden Series)--She may be a hottie, but she's one hell of a mage! Nothing can stand against her thunder spells...or any of her spells for that matter...

5) Comic Relief: Vash (Trigun)--As long as he's not angsting, he can be pretty funny, not to mention he's a skilled sharpshooter. It would be funny to have him and Jeane in the same party. Especially with Jade thrown into the mix. Lol."

"event","Much to my dismay, I find myself becoming more and more impulsive (especially when it comes to spending money *sigh*). I mean, I never though of myself as impulsive before. Before, I used to think and think...and, well, not do much else. Still, I'm not certain that this change is for the best. After all, I might end up broke because of it....^^;

But I must admit that being impulsive has served me well in some regards. I mean, I didn't have to really think about any decisions. I would just make my choice on a whim and that would be that. I mean, that's how I ended up at UF in the first place I guess.

But now, I feel I can't be impulsive not only about my choice of grad school, but also, whether or not my chosen path is still right for me.&nbsp;

To tell the truth, I feel as though I'm about to make some kind of colossal mistake that will cause my world to collapse in on me no matter *which* school I choose. I guess the reason I've become so impulsive is so I can avoid making decisions. But, regardless of what decision I make and whether or not I make it on a whim,&nbsp; I will have to live with the consequences.

I've been following an unseen path blindly, and I have never known where I was going.

All I know is that I dislike uncertainty."

Anyways, it's under my pen name seraphimstarlight. Oh, and though it's actually for Tales of the Abyss, it's in the Tales of Symphonia game section because there is no Tales of the Abyss section yet.

Not really quite sure how that one happened *sweatdrop*. It was nice to have seen Simon and Amanda over Christmas break. I didn't do much else over break though. I must admit that it was nice to sit around and veg for a while. Anyways, on another note, I've also been accepted to one of the two Pharmacy schools I've applied to. I'm still waiting to hear from the other one though, you know, just to have some kind of safety net. That's about it though. Nothing else too exciting happening in my life.

"event","Yeah, I know it's been a while since I last updated my journal, but I kinda got swept along by my games. It took me a long time to finish Xenosaga III and then I started into Disgaea 2 right after that. Now I have some time, so I'll probably get around to updating my journal more often and (hopefully)&nbsp; changing my layout. But here's a quiz, for now.

<table border='0' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='0' width='600'><tr><td><img src=""http://images.quizfarm.com/1146084390Tarot-03-III_The_Empress.jpg""></td><td> You scored as <b>III - The Empress</b>. The Empress is a maternal symbol. She is the mother figure who loves, nurtures and protects.
She will protect you, she will always be there when you are in trouble. When you fall over and graze your knee, the Empress will kiss it better.
Yet she is not a weak figure. Her compassion is strength. If her children are threatened she will stop at nothing to protect them. If well aspected in a Tarot spread, the Empress can symbolise security, protection and unconditional love. If badly aspected it can represent over-protectiveness, fear of risk taking and refusal to face the real world.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>III - The Empress</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='94' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>94%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>VI: The Lovers</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='81' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>81%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>I - Magician</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>XIII: Death</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>XI: Justice</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='69' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>69%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>IV - The Emperor</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='63' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>63%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>XV: The Devil</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='63' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>63%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>II - The High Priestess</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='56' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>56%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>X - Wheel of Fortune</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>0 - The Fool</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='44' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>44%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>VIII - Strength</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='38' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>38%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>XIX: The Sun</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='38' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>38%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>XVI: The Tower</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='13' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>13%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=181614'>Which Major Arcana Tarot Card Are You?</a><br><font face='Arial' size='1'>created with <a href='http://quizfarm.com'>QuizFarm.com</a></font></table>"

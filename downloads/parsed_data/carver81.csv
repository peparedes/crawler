"event","Wow!  It has been forever since I have written in this damn thing.  I am surprised it still works.  However, all that matters is that it still does and I am writing in it right now.  As you have read the heading for this post, it is my last day on the job as an accountant for Magnolia Audio/Video.  I just found out that this just isn't for me, even though I was going to school for it, but as they say only like 50% of people actually use the degree or training that they go to school for.  Ah well.

So with the end of this job, I will be starting my new one come monday morning @ 7:30am.  I will be an Apprentice Custom Installer for the same company and be able to show off my skills in what I like doing.  With this job I will be making more money, with almost unlimited chances for advancement.  I am going to love it.  My wife is supportive of the idea but is always worried about job changes, but atleast it is with the same company so my benefits won't be interupted.

Well that is an update on my life as of the last few weeks.  Hopefully I will have more chances to write in here in the near future."

"event","This is another thing that I would like to point out.  My girlfriend is the most wonderful person in the world, and wouldn't know what to do without her.  She has been there when I have needed her, and she will always be there, just like I will always be there for her.  She has been the love of my life for almost 3 years now, eventhough we have been in and out of our relationship.  When we weren't together I wasn't all that happy.  None of the girlfriends that I had in between compared to her, she stood above them all without a contest.  And now that she is back with me, I am happy again.  We have been together for the second time coming up on 6 months and I never thought before this happened that she would ever come back to me.  I was afraid that she had found someone better than me, which isn't hard to do.  I am a bad boyfriend I have to admit.  I have a few bad things that i shouldn't have.  They were heartless and cold, but I will never do them again because if I do I will lose the best thing that has happended in my life and I don't want to again.  I love her with all of my heart and soul and never ever will I lie, or do anything to hurt her again.  Like I said, she is the love of my life, and she is the one.
To tell you the truth, she is the most significant event in my life.  She has made me a better person than I have been in the past.  Today I wrote a paper that had to do with the most significant event in my life, and I wrote it on her without thinking twice.  As soon as she said, ""You can either write about and summarize your favorite movie, or you can write about the most significant event in your life that has changed your life"", I had her in my head. (not that that was unusual, I always have her on my mind).  But that is just something that I had to get off of my chest, and this seems to be the way to do it.  
Well you will definitely being hearing more about her later.  But if you start to gag or something, just stop reading and comment and I will take it into consideration.  Anyway, I am outta here......."

"event","I will get to yesterday in a bit.  Saturday was absolutely wonderful (but it could have been better if you could have made it dear).  I was up by 7:30 so that I could take a shower before I had to go to my Presidents Day Retreat (PDR) and stand at ease for about an hour.  Before I took off for the PDR, I talked to Malia for a little bit and on the way over to the detachment.  My parents showed up for it, pretty much right at the last minute.  But that is ok because I still love them.  I didn't recieve any awards because I am a new memeber and hadn't been there long enough to earn anything but I am not complaining.  After it was over, my parents came over and met me and my mom of course hugged me and said ""I love you son"", and my dad came over and shook my hand and said ""You look good, I am proud of you."" (now that I think of it, you were right Malia)  Before I went out to lunch with my parents, I called Malia at work and her boss was in a pissy mood, but all I wanted to do was call to say that I loved her and I got shot down by the woman, ahh well, I got to talk to her later after my parents left.  We then went out to lunch and paruzed the town until my parents had to go.  One of the places that we went was the little art museum that we have in town... The John Clymer art museum.  Then they went home and I just chilled waiting for yesterday to come. 
    Ahhh yes, yesterday was a wonderful day with the misses.  Malia and Lauren showed up about 9:30 after I had gotten out of the shower, and then procceded to break my window.  Anyway, they came up to my room futs around a bit and then went to see Justina, and then I went to meet them there.  I then went and changed my shirt, so I walked back down to my room changed, and went over to Jason's place where I find my girlfriend drinking a Hard lemonade that I knew that she would be drinking when I got there.  Then I hear from Lauren that she was talking about it all the way out here, but that is ok.  Anyway, the rest of the day went on fine.  We played some pool and softball while the ladies sat and watched while they plucked eyebrows.  But that was about it.  So I guess I could say that is was a wonderful day, but it could have been better if I got to spend a little more personal time with Malia, and no I am not talking about personal sexual acts time, just time alone.  Under the circumstances, it was fine though.  Because when you are around people that you know don't have what you do, it is hard to not do what you normally do when you are not around them.  So like I said I didn't mind too much because I really don't want anyone else going through what I went through for 2 1/2 years with Mark and Justina..... being a third wheel isn't fun.  If I have offended the two of you then I am sorry.  
   Well I am going to get to a little bit of studying, so I will fill you in with the rest of my life later."

"event","I am having the most wonderful day, well except for the drunk guy calling my room at three o'clock this morning and waking me up, but other than that it is wonderful.  My day started off by the phone call, and then I woke up again at about 7:30 and jumped on the computer in a half awake half chipper mood.  I then got to talk to my girlfriend Malia (there you go dear I used your name);)  Yes we are wierd because we talk at 8 o'clock in the morning on AIM, but I think it is fine.  While I was talking to her I was also studying for my Human Geography test, which I think I didn't do half bad on.  The only thing that actually sucked about today, and last night was that I had to be in the same room as Mark and Mandy.... it is a little awkward and kind of disrespectful since they told me that they have had sex while I was sleeping. (thank god I sleep hard, no pun intended)  Anyway, I had another test in my computer aided drafting class that I don't think I did half bad on either...
  I then had lunch with Mark and another guy from our geography class who likes to go by ""Stumpy"" since he has an amputated arm... yes I feel bad calling him that but that is what he wants.  Well that has pretty much been my day and hasn't been bad at all..... and for some reason I feel horny, don't ask............."

"event","I just got back from my softball game for this thursday, and I did a shitty job.  First off I was barely on time for the game.  I had just enough to warm up real quick.  Then when I found out I was at the end of the batting order that didn't help with the frustration that I was pretty much late for the game.  Then during the game I missed a throw to first, it was partially his fault but it was also mine.  Then I procceeded to miss a routine pop fly which would have saved the game, but I didn't.  I know this is a game for fun because it is just intramural but you would have to understand how competitive I am and how into the game I get.  So with that said you might understand why I am in a crappy mood..... Jason and Mark had great games themselves though.  So did the rest of the team."

"event","I know that I haven't written in this lately but I have been at home and I don't usually have time to write in it when I am there.  But I had a wonderful weekend.  Friday I saw my girlfriend and we watched the movie ""Bounce"".  Saturday I went to Portland to help my grandfather take 4 trees down in his back yard.  Sunday was a day of going to the hospital to get my throat checked and find out I have pharingytis, and fixing my car.  I then went to see my girlfriend again and watched the other movie we had rented ""Men of Honor"".  On Monday my day started out nice, until my car broke down on Highway 18 with a semi coming up on my butt, that was a fun experience.  But the rest of my day consisted of fixing my car and spending some more time with my wonderful girfriend and Jason and Lauren.  We went out to dinner at red robin and had lots of fun.  
    Well the last couple of days have been great.  We won our softball game and I got to make up a test that I missed on Monday.
    But right now I don't know what the matter is.  My girlfriend is mad at me because she thinks that I don't trust her and that I am pissed at her.  But what really happened was in my live journal someone got into it and wrote an entry to me and that someone was her, but I didn't know that until after I changed my password.  And that is why she doesn't trust me because she thinks that I changed it because of her.  I didn't do that.  And now I can't get a hold of her because she is at work.  I really need to talk to her and I hope that she calls me or something, because I don't want her to be mad at me, I don't want her to think that I don't trust her and I don't want her to not trust me.  Honey I hope you read this soon or call me...."

"event","Well the last few days have been slowly going down hill.  Tuesday, I was playing softball, and this bitch rather than tagging me with her glove elbowed me in the bone right above my package.  That hurt like a bitch.  Wednesday was going ok up until the point I went to put my necklace on (the one that I like very much) and it broke and all of the beads fell off so I can't fix it.  So, I wasn't a happy camper.
Now to start off today.  I got up, and made it to class on time to find that we had a guest speaker, it wasn't that bad but I was tired.  I then went to English and forgot that we had a quiz and kind of bullshitted my way through it.  After that my father showed up about 1:00pm and helped me put the exhaust back on my car, that made me happy so I can go see my girlfriend tomorrow.  I then went to my by weekly softball game and got hit again in the back of my calf and I really wanted to kick some ass but there is a thing with sportsmanship.  That incident put me in a pissy mood.  Then my girlfriend got mad at me for lying to her which I didn't.  So I am not in a fabulous mood like I was earlier today.  But anyway, I am going to go relax, take a deep breath and watch a movie.  So I will update you later on how everything is."

But to go back to last night, I sat and watched tv with my girlfriend on the phone (yes we were watching the same show over the phone) and I did feel like we were a normal couple, like we spend a lot of time together.  The only difference to it is that we weren't cuddling on the couch watching it together...other than that I am fine with it.  I had fun.  Anyway, I also watched ""Little Nickey"" for the first time and it is hilarious.  I advise you that if you like Adam Sandler, go see it.... Well I am going to go get ready for my softball game...wish me luck...."

"event","Well, as you all know, my car is a pain in the ass.  I finally got it working though.  I spent all day Saturday working on it and also spent about $86 for parts in one day, that was fun.  But on the other hand I am not paying for insurance and I have it here at school.  But there are two things I am not happy about, one is that I have no more money to restore it, and two my girlfriend won't ride in it anymore until I get seat covers. (I love you honey, and you know it).  Well anyway, that is all I have to say about that.
   On the other hand, she did ride in it so I could take her home and I spent about three hours or so with her at her house until I went back to school.  And in light of that I need to say something; on friday when I saw her, and we pretty much cooked dinner together, I fell in love with her all over again even though she was soaking wet from playing in the rain.  Every time I see her I fall more and more in love, and over and over again.  This is one of the reason I know that she is the one that I want to be with the rest of my life.  She is the only one that I have been solely in love with in my life, and I have had feelings for a few women, but these are the first and only true feelings I have had for anyone.  She is the most amazing woman I have met and want to ever meet, she is perfect to me, and I never want to let her go.  And since I know she is reading this, ""Honey....I mean every word I say.""  Well on that fluffy note, I need to get ready to go to class and finish an assignment.  And in a few words from Lone Star, ""Baby, I'm amazed by you."""

"event","I have had a weird twist in emotions today, at first I was happy and all chipper, and then all of a sudden when I couldn't do anything with my princess, I just about died when I had to say no.  But I believe that I have found a way to spend time with her so again my emotions have twisted again.....what a wonderful life.  Well, I created this account a while ago, it was just at the wrong time since we were fucking with a certain someones head, now that was fun....  So this is actually my first journal entry.
    Anyway, my day has went pretty well, besides the fact of the emotion thing but I am an odd guy. (sometimes I think I am more like a girl, moody).  I actually love my days, I don't have to get up until 9:00am to get to class at 10, it is a wonderful thing.  My days other than that go pretty easily.  Today went really easy.  All of my classes were sit and listen, no work. :)  I also had one of my Air Force ROTC classes and talked about communication, that was fun for the fifteen minutes we talked about it, and then we played a game called Crud.  After that I went and played a game of softball and kicked some ass, it felt really good to do that.  Then, I got to talk to my wonderful girlfriend (princess), and it made me feel even better.  
    Well to get on a different subject, since that was pretty much my day; it is really hard to know that your girlfriend, that you love with all of your heart and soul, knows she loves you as much if not more, but doesn't know if the two of you will last forever like you know you will.  I have learned to live with it, and now know that it is ok for it to be that way at this point in time, and that if you believe and know that you need to be the strong one like you have always been.  I know I have done a few things wrong, but I am glad that she has forgiven me for what I have done and stayed with me.  I know that I have lost her trust with the things that I have done, but I am here to gain it back and be the boyfriend that I should have been a long time ago, and never do anything to hurt her or to lose her trust again.  I have made promises to her that I haven't made and that I have broken, and I hope that she will eventually believe me again if I were to say that they stand for something other than just words.  I just hope that she will do that again.  I love her with everything that I have within me, and it will never go away.  I hope that she will stay with me forever.  
    The one thing that I need to do is become more romantic, the only problem with that is that everytime I want to be, nothing goes the way I want it to.  Like this last weekend, I planned to work on my car and bring it back to working condition with some new parts on Saturday, and then on Sunday take her to a little place called Carbonado, and have an afternoon picnic before I had to go back to school.  But nooooo, the guy that I bought my car part from was being an idiot and didn't have the money to give me to return the part so he tried to fine the tool for me to use to fix it, but he never got back to me on Saturday so I ended up fixing my damn car on the day that I wanted to spend with my girlfriend.  But I guess it worked out, just not the way I wanted it to.  So I guess I will just have to plan something else for this weekend, ah well.  Just watch, with my luck it won't work.  Well I think that whoever is reading this is absolutely bored with my life so I will stop the blabbering of my problems and let you all go.  Princess, if you are reading, take none of it bad because as I said I love you with everything inside of me."

today i went for a run at about 9pm- when the sun had finally set and i could look up at the few visable stars it made me sad knowing that although i look at the same sky and breathe the same air everyone i care about is so far away. i lost a good friend due to a comment... but the more i look at it... he wasnt really a friend. he wanted what i couldnt give him and because of that he kept me at a distance... if that makes any sense at all. 

girls and broken hearts go together like an engine and oil. i dont understand- im not sure i want to. i cry when i think of what he did to her.. and i thank my lucky stars it didnt happen to me-

i cant seem to wrap my hands close enough around the throat of the mindless person my thoughts have created... she continues to breathe and plot things that should not be done. i sit and count the number of people i will hurt until all is said and done. although i have gotten closer to a few i have pushed many more away and in this process hurt the hearts of some and im afraid im breaking one of another. how do you look someone in the eye and tell them ""you just arent good enough""

the dreams are back- after so long... the dreams... they came back. after so long that taste in my mouth, that pinch in my foot, and that smell that makes me sneeze. 

i sat down and wrote something today- it was a lifeless piece of bullshit that directed yet another bastard how to complete things that only a monkey should have to do... granted.. i wrote and it felt amazing. 

recently i saw something in someone that i wanted. i thought i had it but i fake it. something that i want to have for myself, and never let go of. i will work on it. i have to earn it, and i cant let myself give up, help me not to give up. 

i sent him a letter. it should be arriving soon. how i got the address is beyond me."

"event","This life, this indulgence of all that is minor ... why do i hold onto things with little meaning. I mean i give all of myself to things that dont deserve my attention in any shape or form. Why do i force myself to linger in emotions that make me unhappy. I confess there are feelings brought on by meaningless icons that capture the moment and devour your instance so that your basically shut off from all the practical thoughts you may have. But those few moments, are they worth it? Nothing seems to stay around long enough to make a difference. Not love, life, happiness, there is not one thing i can remember that has stayed long enough in my life that its made such an emotion last longer than short time. Whats the point? when does this endless cycle of bullshit end? When you need someone, they arent there, when you need something, you can have it, when you reach out, theres noone there to grasp your hand. So tell me... why do i allow the capturing of my heart, emotions, and just myself, to any person or thing when it wont be around long enough to make any sort of difference? 

im scared. of my life, of myself, and of everything i have no control over, which seems to be more than what i can handle. i dont know what i want, i dont know how to get there. i havent the slightest clue of anything anymore now that the things i thought highest of have let me down."

to have expectations in a person, thing, feeling, or any type of emotion consciously directed.  they always say that without the hard times, and the pain in the world we would take all of the great things for granted. what about those who consistently take in the hard stuff, the pain and the wrong. and the reward is just that of something else that will make you tear up and want to hide a corner for the rest of your life. i probably have it better off than alot of people. but why does it feel like every time i turn around, something else is surrounding me with a cloud and the rain just seems to follow me no matter where i seem to go. it may not be storming on me, but the rain has never stopped. im waiting for my rainbow."

its not that i dont want to talk to these people.. in fact the ones that i did talk to i miss. but god dammit. seriously now... how the fuck am i supposed to get over someone i still fucking love if i cant forget everything about him!!???!?!!!??!??!?!?!?!?! the people would make it worse. he killed my heart with this bullshit. and as much as i wish i could have my fairytale ending.. i wont. why? because hes too damn stubborn to make an effort. everyone knows that when a girl does this bullshit... that she secretly wants him to chase her down. even the dude that acts dumb... and says he never knew it ... he does, he knows it.. and the ones who act on it... they get everything ever dreamed of. 

besides, i may have taken the step to end it because i felt, neglected, and mistreated emotionally, but you knwo what, i made the step and explained what i needed and hes the one that chose to not take that road. so what am i supposed to do? cry my eyes out every night, begging him to talk to me so i can win him back. FUCK NO. im tired of the all shit i had to do all the time ... i suffered thru this long distance relationship just as much as he did, but i did it because i love him, yea thats right i still do ... i cant just erase it. i need to take him out of my life to get over it, get over him.

ive probably stated all of this before sometime, many times and never followed through with it thinking it would cause rough seas in a very important part of my life. however that part is almost gone. the decision, finally will more than likely be spoken next weekend. and whatever it may be i will take it and grow with it. become a better stronger person with what ive learned. its going to be beneficial to my whole being, not just a direct influence on the actual part of a life it reflects from.

criticism over something so small can hurt a ton. what can be seen by one as a benefit of knowledge is seen by another as a stab to an awkward part of the body. intentions should be unclear, however im sure you can see right through them. so tell me, why say something if im finally going back to how i was? i dont get people. i wish i just fucking wish. 

its hard to swallow, sometimes i catch myself staring, but i dont understand why. i mean everyone hurts over stupid things, but those who are smart, they let go. why must i be in the bottom percentile? ha! 

it feels good to write again, i swear ive written 7 stories in the past 2 weeks. they sit unread in my desk. where they will stay. i like it when theres a glimmer of what might be happening, but noone really understands. even the people involved in such inviting situations are seriously unaware of my actual feelings. so please dont try to understand what i write. youll have to ask, because theres actually only about half of the chance that you are correct. im about 99.9% sure that people have given up on reading this thing anyway. mostly its a release of my thoughts. ehh. :)

last night we lost our first game of the season... and i dont care, its not an upset its more of a reality check connecting to other aspects of this life i was given. 

im no longer interested in the people i had relationships with, with a shallow demeanor. 

its been fulfilling hearing what the people im conversing with really have to say about life, love, and the relationships they are dealing with .... 

this week has been an eye opener... a cool down from a fabulous weekend, with extraordinary people... :D

lets just hope this sticks with me, i like the happier side of life... 

oh Best Buy Sucks :D"

"event","so i was at the pool for a few hours... and these extremly nerdy guys studying the differences between leadership and management as from the harvard books they were continuously referencing... decide they want to play vball... (water vball) so ""whitey"" the dude that looks albino is the first to get in complaining of the cold water... the rest of the group joins and they begin to play.. they suck ... very very.. very badly. the one guy that is decent is handicapped by the fat hes playingint he deeper end. the one black guy says out loud ""i cant swim and i cant play volleyball.. im not so sure this is a good combination for me"" ... i laugh... they look. 
they start toplay again and im chuckling with all the mistakes and new rules that are being put into play... we exchanged a few words... sorries for splashing me, or asking me if i enjoyed that hilarious volly ect. finally they give in.. jsut as i get up and put on my none other than my vball shirt. lol they look they laugh... they ask my name... lol hahahahahaha. ig uess u had to be there... people on the other side of the pool were laughing at this too. lol"

"event","for whatever reason last night i forgot to pull up one of my bigger blankets other than a sheet to keep myself warm.. and this morning my arms were tucked under my body and my legs looked as i was some type of weird gymnist ... to sumit up i looked like a roly poly and i was freezing. 

lately i havent ben able to go to bed before 2.. maybe ryan rubbed off on me with his insomnia. or maybe i jsut dont want to sleep and its my way of torturing myself ehh who knows. 

so the caddies show was a 50 percent let down. hey i got to tsee them in concert again :D W00T! but it sucked because well you just couldnt feel it, and on top of it the pit was controlled by stupid jocks so it was a bit unecessary. anywhos... 

so today i work til 3, and when i get home i desperatly want to take a nap. we'll see if i do. 

i have hw to do tha ti can do tomorrow, however its going tobe late and witrh the last paper  well it really isnt worth doing. i hate school.... and work and having to manage time.. i wanna do what i wanna when i wanna do it end of story. 

looking forward to wed. i ge tmy call from lifestyles should be a fun ajob.... las tnight i did a fish fry at teh legion made like 35 bucks in 23 hours and got free drink tickets or whatever.. :D yummy. anyway

Ryan is back in gville...me= somewhat sad. i miss him. (insert invisable RANT right here








and ends here) :-/

comp II wont be too bad the research paper is only 1000 words. lol i can bs almost any topic there... it just has to be on a living person, someone we admite but has a book written about the,.. sorry todd. lol Ive chosen dayle hinman, shes a profiler for the fbi. yadda yadda. 

OD is just a basatard all together. mother f*ers !! theyre complaining because im in school and dont want to work more than 15 hrs. ive already proven to everyone that i suck at school... if i could id NOT work at all... they should be happy. but im def going to talk to this lady that offered me the job in tampa. OD isnt going anywhere... and with this other job pt and off on weekends!! CORPORATE office?? HA! yes bitch !

"event","I have a feeling today will suck. i take that back, after dealing with two complaining customers,(after writing the first sentence) who brought the misfortune on themselves by not reading the paper to the full extent, or by grabbing the wrong item from the shelf. .... (yea... dumb asses)so the correction stand that the day has no fortune of sucking.. it already DOES!!!! this is my life, i work with the general public. feel sorry for me. i certainly do. 

im not sure why the OD unblocked myspace and lj from the internet accessibility management thingy. but i like it. :P  

so yea, Peter, the guy who is working on my tshirt order has finally insructed me to upload the PDS format of the graphic. This is after uploading three versions of tif, eps, jpg and now psd. all different sizes. and over a weeks worth of email tag. im seriously hoping that this file will complete this never ending cycle. if it doesnt, im returning the order... and getting my money back BASTARDS!! 260 bucks on something i ordered in time for xmas and wont have til mid january!!!! Sam is QUITE PISSED!

yesterday i invited Ryan out to meet me at OD so he could go to lunch with me. I was goign to pay for it. and then when i checked my purse while clockign out to my astonishment i left my cc in my jeans formt he night before :(( i felt so bad. and then ry made a joke about me tricking him lol. it was funny, but kinda hurt too... moer of a 80-20 feeling. 

so anyway .... im off to discourage myself with the stupid people that live in this area.. who cant seem to get high scores on a test with the first question of  1. I am a team player?...

"event","so lately ive been feeling kinda bad about not talking to all my guy friends. i know why ive stopped, and tbh it really isnt a good enough reason now that i think about it. it really isnt being recpricated on the other end. so now im feeling really bad. 

ive been thinking about things as usual, and when/if Ry and i break up... i dont want a boyfriend for a very long time. im talking years. i just cant stand this having so many secrets, not being mentioned, and having to worry about other girls. i guess i cant fully trust anyone .... im serious i DO NOT trust ANYONE, completly. 

so now that ive stopped talking to most all the guys i know, they havent really been talking to me, unless they are the ones soley wanting in my pants. :-/ which aggrivates me. 

i feel im being cheated. 

why does everything always turn out so gloomy :-/"

"event","i havent talked to courtney about the tickets to the game, very sad. i still want to go. 

 anyway... im feeling it again... i just want to run away. go someplace and be surrounded.... i mean SURROUNDED by the people that care about me most. everyone, my closest friends who i cant say that are close to me since they are litterally so F*n far away... and the family that is now disfunctional, but still they are my family, and they try to understand everything that im going through. especially Erick and michelle.... what i would give to jsut go up there and chill like we used to. 
why does life have to be one big secret.. people keeping things from eachother, people lying to one another, UGH!! i guess its all one giant circle. i know ive done it. ive been a terrible person at times in my life. have you ever thought about some of thing happening actually scarring you to the point of not believing in yourself or not wanting to go out on a limb after that one experience? ive felt that so many times, and i jsut keep doing it to myself, i have to question... Why do i do it? Its as if i dont know, or understand myself, or my actions these days... GRRRR!!! i guess one day ill be that person i picture myself to be, but its not now, thats for sure. :-/ One day. 




Cole- remember that feeling of being on the side of the stage... watching the soloist, knowing that you just weren't there YET...? the feel of ambition, but also the feeling of failure since that wasn't you, even though you still had yet another year to successfully reacht he destination of which your heart so eagerly desired? yea... i remember it... the difference between you and i... you went for it... i stayed ont he side and watched... now i regret most everything in my life. Tell me it will be ok, and ill believe you... lie to me if you have to.... lies are the basis of life :-/"

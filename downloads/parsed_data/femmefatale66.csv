"event","This is the first time in quite awhile that i have felt truly happy, on&nbsp;a deeper level. Obama is the next president. It couldn't have happened at a better time. We need change, and I really hope he can come through and be an FDR type of president. Although I am excited and inspired I'm not going to rub it in Republicans faces. They should know by now they have done wrong, or not well.They are so much ruder, and immature about everything. When McCain gave his speech (which seemed genuine and articulate) people BOOed as he congratulated obama. you don't see democrats doing that because we have more sense. Obama is under so much pressure, and he has a lot to work on in order to get this country going again, but i think he has the knowledge and the tenacity to do it. He will be scrutinized for everything because he is black. if one thing goes wrong i feel like everyone will jump all over him. but im glad to trust the next four years in his hands. its about fucking time."

"event","<p><br />Tomorrow I will have been home a week and i still dont know what to do. I worked a little this week, which helped get my mind off stuff, but I'm just bored and lonely and miss my best friend. It's weird because when i talk to him i picture exactly where he is in the apartment, or walking to steinway street, or in the subway. i dont know if that helps me or hurts because its so much more specific. Tomorrow is Halloween, my favorite holiday. I want to go out and have a great night but i dont know if it will work out that way. <br /><br />i feel like i wont be able to go out without taking a xanax. but if i take xanax i wont be able to drink. and that always gets weird. you get the same questions:<br />1) are you religious?<br />2) are you pregnant?<br />3) is someone in your family an alcoholic?<br />4) are you straight edge?<br /><br />there should be a number five on there<br /><br />5) Are you not drinking because you had a slight mental breakdown from living in new york city and you are unable to handle simple tasks because you have so much anxiety you cant function, especially in social situations like this one, so you self medicate to get through an evening that should be a fun time with friends so you abuse xanax before the party so you can make it to the party and then realize you shouldnt drink while on a bunch of xanax?</p><p>its not necessarily peer pressure, but people that are drinking always judge the non-drinkers. i have definitely done it to the non-drinkers, whether that was their lifestyle choice or they had a test the next day or something. i only went to&nbsp;a handful of parties where i was completey sober while in college- it was usually because i went out too late and didnt feel like catching up with drinking at 1am, so i just didnt do it. occasionally i was still hungover from the night before, but someone in my group would always counter that excuse with &quot;the best way to cure a hangover is to keep drinking!&quot; i tried it, but it didnt really work for me. so im going to be that girl at the party. the awkward non-drinker. or ill be the drunk girl that goes crazy when she has a panic attack from drinking. either way im not going to be making any new friends tomorrow.</p>"

This time, I came back home after living in New York City, which is worse than Cave Creek. Who would have thought. I don't really know what to do now. I miss Ryan. I'm thinking I'll probably return to California in a few months when i get my head straight, and just hope that Ryan doesnt meet someone or break up with me in the meantime. I guess i can't worry about it until it happens.

It's so different from fiction, and i hope it will help me be flexible and incorporate more elements into my fiction. 

My apartment is sweet, My roommates kick fucking ass. However, we will probably be evicted on Wednesday if we don't get another roommate. After extensive facebook stalking ( which is semi-ironic since facebook has indeed become quasi-""big brother"" on defenseless college kids around the country) we might have found some chick willing to live with us. i fucking hope so. i dont really want to live on campus. and i already changed my meal plan.

I want to work for a cool magazine, and write fiction on the side. I hope this happens. Just depends on how bad i want it. My mom wanted me to fly back to PHX for easter. She bought me a ticket and everything but she's having me miss a day of school so i had to decline. I have finals and I'll be home for like ten days after that before may term. Lame. We don't even do anything at Easter. We arent religious. It would be a waste of time. And i only have a few weeks left with people who wont be here for may term.

Ive had some practice since i was home all summer...anyway, been hanging out with Ki a lot which has been fabulous, made me realize how much i truly missed her. ive been shopping, with money i dont have, or watching other people shop. muy intersante. Ryan got in last night so hopefully I'll be able to see him in the next few days. Irena and i hung out with Ian last night, and that was a lot of fun. Although i think it brought back some crappy high school memories for everyone. But fun regardless. That kid is ridiculously good looking. On another note, my brother and his wench left this morning. She was a bitch. Everyone hated her. She doesn't treat my brother very well. That shit doesn't fly in our family. Cancelled Christmas was actually really fun. Had a bunch of friends over and everyone got kinda shitty and we played catch phrase for about 6 hours. Good Times. It's weird being home and being able to drink free, nice booze. I feel classier, even if i am drinking in my parents house. ha. Hope New Years is fun, and perhaps i will resolute.

Went to the Alkaline Trio concert and it was fucking AWESOME! Just as it should have been. Matt is prettttty hot. I had so much fun with Lo and Vinny, who is an awesome bodyguard. They played so many great songs, but I am definitely not drinking before a show again. I'll pass. 
Ryan came last week, i saw him twice. It was bittersweet. It almost would have been easier for me if hadn't seen him, since I miss him so much. I called him on Friday to wish him a safe trip home, and after that i promised myself i wouldn't call him or text him. I was doing damn good! Not thinking about him and stuff, and then he fucking calls me tonight...down the drain again. So I am starting from scratch. 
Lately, i have become aware that numerous movies were filmed on my lovely campus, so i have been watching them. Examples include: Slackers, and Rules of Attraction. It's crazy. 
I have been hanging out with Ki more which has been much needed for me anyway...
Only a couple more weeks and then i get to go see my brother...what what?! Then i get to go to school early for training...It should be fun though, maybe I'll meet more cool people? Is that possible?
Excellent.

"event","WELL. I am not thrilled with my job. I don't feel as bad though, since most of my other employed friends are not feeling their jobs this summer either. This is the first job I've had where i genuinely do not look forward to going to work. Whateves. Life is really weird right now, I'm missing my Redlands crew, but at the same time I'm missing my Az Crew because go figure, a lot of the people i wanted to spend time with are abroad. This brings me to my next dilema. Parental units are going out of town for fourth of july weekend. Naturally, Lo and i will be partying it up. However, they will all be Lo's friends, since mine won't really be around. So, to whoever is reading this, you should come to my house and party. There's a bunch of movies i still want to see but most of them nobody else wants to see. HERMPF. Well I'm gonna go hang out with Ki. Hooray!"

"event","Well. It's storming and raining up here in the boonies, and its quite nice to hear rain and thunder. Reminds me of my rainy year in So Cal. I got a job. Finally. Carefree Station. I'm not making much money but hopefully i will get a lot of hours. I had the weirdest yet best birthday ever, two days ago. I woke up went out to lunch with my Grandma, got ready and started my first day at work. It was crazy and i never got trained, they just threw me to the wolves. Luckily, after three years of hostessing i kinda know what the fuck I'm doing. Basically same thing, different table numbers. I really would rather be serving but I'm only gonna be here for a little bit. Naturally, the only guy i was flirting with turns out to be 26. That's a bit too old for me. Oh well. It's easy, just really boring. So i walk out to my truck, I'm talking to my sister on the phone and there is a bouquet of flowers on my lock box. It was such a great surprise, and they were from my one and only Serbian! Then i drove home and hung out with my parents and sister and Kiki (well my dad was actually on the couch, but he was like within 20 feet of us, so I'm gonna tally him anyway). Lo is taking me to Alkaline Trio!!!!!!!! HOORAY! I'm so excited to see a concert with her, just like old times! We aren't going to the Warped Tour this year, no good bands. I got a digital camera so that was cool as well. Probably the best part of my birthday was finding out how many people care about me...haha. My brother, out of all people started calling me at 7am to wish me a Happy Birthday, and kept calling me till i finally picked up. It was sweet considering he never remembers this kind of stuff, or pretends he doesn't give a fuck. Umm let's see Harley not only called me, but sent me something. Brenna called me. Ali called me at midnight, Ryan texted me at midnight, so 3 am his time, then called me later that day. Ki texted me and called me of course. Stefano called me. Jasper called me. I talked to Liz numerous times. And the list goes on. Usually everyone forgets, so hooray! Don't squash my dreams by saying that the only reason these people remembered was because the facebook sent them messages. Bitches. Today i woke up at one pm and went to work. I really miss Tonto. God thats so pathetic saying that but i reallly do. Ryan said hes going to try to go back to U of R for fall, which would be awesome but i truly doubt he will. My sister and i have opposite schedules so i never get to see her anymore, or she goes to bed early since B of A consists of Nazis. Oh LOOEEEYYY"

"event","Ok. So i have been back home for like a week or something like that. It's weird for sure. The last day on campus was stressful, and it sucked moving out all my stuff. Amazing, it all fit in the rah so that was good. I didn't even leave CA until 5PM, so i got home like 10. I was convinced my snowboard fell out somewhere in Indio. However, i pulled up to a stoplight in Wickenburg and i saw it, so hooray for me. Then I went and picked up Ali at the airport the next day and we hung out for six days. Sadly, Az is really boring in comparison to San Diego, but it was still good to spend time with her. We hung out with Liz and Stefano a couple times, but they were both being really weird...I've been trying to get a job, i guess El Encanto is showing the most hope. I just know im broke nigga, I'M BROKE! Parents out of town starting tomorrow, so there could be small gatherings taking place at my house. Excellent. I talked to Ryan a couple days ago and hes coming out to AZ in July maybe, so I'm excited. Haven't seen much of Kiki, and when i do she seems preoccupied, so i hope shes doin ok. I bought a dress today, it has polka dots on it, and that's all you need to know."

However, i think I am going to try and finish it tonight, just to be on the safe side. Good idea? I think so. I am coming home quite soon, and have massive amounts of shit to complete before this time arrives. I hope the rah rah can hold all my shit. I am not bringing back as much shit to college next year. I didn't use half of it. It just took up space. Stupid Stupid. We got caught for alcohol on our last Saturday night here. It blew, especially since the RD IS A BITCH. She searched our room and sassed us, and made us open up our fridge. She took all our liquor. We have a meeting with her at 9:15 tonite. fucked up. Jon has been here all weekend, so that's been cool. I really need a job. Bad. I need to continue the homework process."

"event","<P>I'm sick again. My throat is sore, my stomach hurts, my head is throbbing, and I am producing hardcore amounts of mucous. It's lovely. Anyway, Thursday was pretty fun, Brenna and i drove to Orange County and hung out with her friend Nick, and went to this huge house party at her friend Wes' house. Madness. Brenna has some hot friends fo sho! We had a lot of fun, almost got in a fight on the way out, pretended to be lesbians at one point in order to ward of weirdos....good times. Then the three of us crammed into Nick's bed, and Brenna and I drove back to school at like 7:30am so I could attend class...Eww. Friday we all just relaxed and hung out and watched some movies. Saturday we got up and drove up to Big Bear to stay with Stefano's hot snowboarder friend John...and madness ensued. It was so fucking great be in another location, the weather was gorgeous, it smelled like pine cones. While we were driving up through the winding mountains, windows down, music up, screaming to songs at the top of our lungs it felt so great. I looked at my friends who mean so much to me now and just smiled. This is how college is supposed to be. </P>

"event","<P>Ok. So. Friday was cool i guess. I slept most of the day after class, then showered and we all got ready to make ourselves presentable to society. Then we (Liz, Ali, me, Jasper, Stefano, and Harley) went to Duke's Ball for Liz's Maroon and Grey thing. We basically just hung out and ate chocolate covered strawberries and listened to some good jazz music. Then Ali and went to Starbucks all dressed up and felt retarded, but oh well...</P>

<P>Then we all dicked around per usual, and everyone enjoyed a drunk dial from the missing Ryan. Saturday we got up and went to the Battle of the Bands, and it was nice because the sun was finally fucking out, and it wasn't raining and cold. It was great because it was free, and there was only like 150 people there to watch Sugarcult. I enjoy them, it's not like they are my favorite band or anything, but i enjoyed being a foot away from them, and they played a good live show.</P>

So, after i slapped him in the face with my cock he made George Washington into Joey Ramone and signed it. The lead singer guy was not as chatty with us, but he had some awesome tattoos.</P>

<P>So after this we ate, and then went to the Chapel to see Daniel Killon who was fucking HILARIOUS, and David Allen Grier, who was funny but not as funny, in our opinions. Then we went bowling and fucked around and such. Today i layed in the sun and read, and now I'm craving some chocolate, and eventually have to write a paper. Good times! Peace Bitches!</P>"

"event","First week of May Term has proved to be more demanding than i thought, but i am keeping really busy, and hopefully i will end up doing well in the class. It sucks though because i have class monday, tuesday, thursday, AND friday, whereas most people have just monday through thursday...Anyway the weather has been shit since i have been back. I am truly disappointed in the amount of rain in Southern California. Ridiculous. I have been wearing a sweatshirt and jeans ever since i got back...and i SHOULD BE BASKING IN THE SUNLIGHT ON THE FUCKING QUAD. But no. So tonight should be fun, we are going to this dinner thing for Liz and her honor society. And tomorrow should be fun as well, we have the battle of the bands all day, then Sugarcult is playing, and then we are going to see David Allen Grier in the Chapel. The best part? All free. Woot. I have been hanging out a lot with Brenna, generally getting my ass kicked at Scrabble because she is that hardcore. Last night we went and got some homemade Mexican food which was reallly good, and watched some Mariachis perform and what not. Later that night everyone was drinking margaritas, which eventually just turned into straight shot taking. Everyone got really messed up, there was puking on behalf of many people. I was actually glad for once i was sober. Then Ali went with Linda to Brockton, and came back TOTALLY fucked up. I was so worried she had alcohol poisioning, puking, crying, hyperventilating, making no sense. It was really scary but after a couple hours we calmed her down and she fell asleep. i was convinced we should have taken her to the emergency room but it turned out well, thankfully. Ive talked to ryan a couple times, and its already different. I can tell in the tone of his voice hes probably already forgotten about me, and our conversations will soon be obligatory for him, and too few and far between for me. Looks like somebody should move the fuck on eh?"

"event","OK. Back in SOCAL for my final three weeks of school. My fiction class seems cool, and of course i love the professor. Today is cloudy and shitty, and i feel lethargic after my two and a half hour nap. I went back to AZ for a week, drove Ryan to his dad's house and unpacked his shit. The rest of the break was spent trying to become employed, and it's reallly hard when you aren't 19, thus cannot serve liquor. So, basically my parents just bitched at me the entire break, and i lived in fear and paranoia that they would notice the gaping hole in my nose. My mom of course found out, and was cool with it? But i don't plan on telling my dad, atleast for awhile...However, its a weight lifted off my shoulders that i put there. It sucked not having my sister at home. I got to see Ki a couple times, not as much as i would have liked, its just hard since we live far apart and all. Carey stayed with us for a couple days, since Aunt Connie is still in the hospital, and not doing well. I went and visited her, pretty much to say goodbye. She's the only relative on my dad's side that i actually like, what are the odds? I hate hospitals, with a passion. The smells, the people, the machines, the feeling, the sterility....creeps me out. Hmm, so one night when i was home, Liz, Harley, Ryan and i went out to dinner. It was crazy weird seeing them in my town, but it was nice. I definitely have two seperate lives. Saying goodbye to ryan was realllly hard. I cried, he didn't. Gave him a letter. Wish he was here"

"event","So yea. Last day of classes. Relieved? Of course i am. My mom comes on thursday to visit me for the day, and I'm kinda nervous. I don't know what to do about my nose...Anyway, i crawled back from death the other night, since Thursday night i got either food poisioning/stomach flu and i couldnt stop puking till about Saturday evening. It was fantastic let me tell you, especially since i have to go through three doors to make it to the hallway bathroom, and then curl up on the floor ready to projectile vomit everywhere when you see....it...Long black curly pubic hairs covering the surface your face is inches away from. I mean pubes are gross enough as it is, but i mean to not know whose they are is disgusting, since apparently at Redlands we are living amongst women who do not practice pube manangement. All my friends helped me out a lot though, and Liz took me to the Health Center, and they told me to put suppositories up my ass in order to stop the puking. Luckily i didnt have to use them. I missed a bunch of shit this weekend though. Friday Ryan and Ali had performances, and i missed both of them, along with my meeting with my professor to discuss my advising position. Plus, it was Ryan's last weekend here pretty much and i didn't get to hang out with him as much as i would have liked. Shit happens though. We went to San Diego i guess last weekend? And it was a lot of fun, with pictures to prove it, of course. I'm looking forward to going back to the creek, because i desperately miss kiki, and i need a change of pace."

"event","I hope everyone is ready for an emo-rific entry because i have been bottling it up for quite some time. I keep worrying about shit and i feel that it is quite plausible that my ulcer will reappear...Anyway. I love my life here. I love my life at home. They are totally different though. I'm a big kid now, sorta...I got my nose pierced a couple weeks ago...looks cute. So now i get to hide this from my dad for the next seven years, since i made a deal with him about no more body modifications. So i guess ill just wear a retainer in it and a lot of concealer for the summer...HOooray. My own stupid fucking fault. Its my body though. 
On another note, I failed. I'm failing. Philosophy. Professor Keith is a dick. If i had a penis (it would be huge by the way) he could suck me off all night long. All he does is lecture. Theres like ten people in the class, and he doesnt know ANYONES name. Ridiculous. Our grade is only out of 300 points total. So considering i failed the first two tests, and the only way i can get a passing grade is to get 100% on the next two tests/final. Fuck that. Theres no way i can do that. Ever. So i am not going to waste my time, busting my ass just to fail. Im sorry in advance mom and dad i know you will hate me forever, but ill get my shit together i promise. 
Lastly, school ends in two weeks. That means that Ryan leaves in two weeks. Which sucks. I have no idea what to do, i hope he still stays in contact with me but he will probably go back to SC and end up dating his ex-gf again and forget about me. I can't even think about that. I'm going to write him a letter and give it to him before i go, just about what a great friend he is etc., but i will probably end up pouring my little heart out, but i hope that doesnt happen. Suggestions? 
I really miss kiki. I never get to talk to her, well as much as i want. And she will be gone next year. And i miss my sister. Especially since i worry about her not having a good time. 
My friends here are the shit though
I got into a Fiction Writing Workshop with Jasper...YES
I got asked to be a peer advisor for a Freshman Seminar next year...woot
I had another weird weekend of drunkeness, and akward moments, and basically i have the italian mafia and the serbian mafia after me.
This weekend we are gonna go to LA JOLLA and im excited. Sometimes you just need to be by the ocean and squeeze a sea lion."

"event","So. I have been pretty happy for the most part, however, i dont think the grades are doing as well as they should be. Case in point, i have a philosophy test tomorrow morning and ive barely finished making myself a study guide. whatever. ummm so good times this week. I picked up Lo at LAX on Wednesday, and i actually made it on time, without getting lost, driving stick in LA traffic. It was great. But it was all worth it to see my sistttter! hooray! We pretty much just hung out, ordered pizzas she met a bunch of my friends etc etc. Thursday was ST.Pattys Day, and Lo and i walked around campus and she took a bunch of pics for her photography class, and i jumped in a bush for her. Hooray. That night i unsuccessfully studied for my spanish midterm since everyone was drinking in my room. Later that night, we went to Delta for a party. I was sober so needless to say i didnt stay long. Then i missed math, and studied for spanish. Took my test, hung with lo and then she lefttt. it was so sad. Friday night i got drunk alone because we were supposed to go to some party but it never ended up happening. So we just watched Collateral. Saturday we spent most of the day in Pet stores, since Ali really wanted a bunny.haha. there are some crazy animals in the Redlands area, P.S. Then it was Harley's B'day,so we went out to eat, then got ready and went to the Debater's House to party (aka get free liquor). Everyone decided to go to the Birds, and im pretty sure i almost puked in the shuttle over there...sexy i know. Made it, and one of ali's guy friends paid for like 5 of us to get in, and we didnt even know him. greatness. Got hit on by two guys, one might i add was quite sexy with a lip ring. Ryan burned a guy with his cigarette. great times. then Ali and i went skipping back drunkenly to williams. Last night we went and saw The Ring Two, and if you know me, you know that is all i have to say. I started taking my birth control again so i feel like shit. and i have to stop procrastinating because i need to do fucking philosophy."

"event","It's been a long time coming, but finally adding some photos of my baby boy. Can't believe he will be 2 months old on Sunday! And back to work in 1 week. Thankfully the life of a teacher dictates that i actually only have to do 1 week of work to get 6 weeks off, and then part time in September (hooray).

Alex has a hernia in his bellybutton which feels really odd, and sticks out loads when he ctries, which sems to be loads at the moment with his colic, but thankfully he is almost sleeping through the night, so i feel rather well equipped to deal with it in the day.

That's it for now.Busy busy.

Can't believe he's growing up so quickly, and already incredibly spoilt. Thanks to everybody for all the fab pressies he's been bought. Will post some pics up soon, but for now the fact he's here will have to do."

She is a gorgeous 5 year old german shepherd called Jodie. Has been really well trained and has very cute floppy ears. Should be picking her up to live with us on 31st january. How exciting.

Going up north tomorrow. Grandad has had a real turn for the worse and not sure that he will recognise us in the next few days. He may still get better but can't be sure.

On the plus side, My cousin had her baby boy on boxing day. If only everything could be that simple."

I have until tomorrow for it to stop then i am under strict orders to go to the doc's and get some vitamins. I can't eat meat, carbohydrate or protein still. Tried a little bit of bolognese last night. I really enjoyed it the first time round!

On the plus side, baby's little heart is beating at 140-147bpm and is still growing well. Can't wait for the scan tomorrow.

Made it to the Port at the weekend to see grandad. Was there for all of an hour before coming back. Was quite shocking really. YOu know what happens when  a person has a stroke but still didn't expect to see it on my grandad. The background noise made it quite hard to understand him, but apart from being ridiculously bored he seems to be doing ok. Back up next week, so will get to keep a check on his progress then.

Bathroom finally plastered. May be able to move home on Christmas eve. Still got to actually plumb the bathroom in and tile it. Can't wait to sleep in my own bed.

Hope everyone is ok.

Look at me writing lots of entries."

"event","Had a bit of a scare last week. Thought we may be losing the baby. Turns out everything is ok and i got to see it's legs kicking and heartbeat. Who new tiny babies had such huge heads. Right now my babies head accounts for 50% of it's entire size. Can you picture all these people wondering around with massive heads? Comic!

So 2 days off school, got to put my feet up (or in real terms, had my mother come over and direct orders about which part of MY house i should clean next- atleast it's ready for the midwife visit on saturday).

Have come back into school today to discover that half the students already know i'm pregnant. Didn't think it would take them too long to work it out, what with all the nausea and puking and days off. Oh well. Hopefully that just means they will be slightly less like the hole in ones anus from now til Easter. Fairly certain that is just wishful thinking. 

Final thought- wire brushes on the end of a drill could do some real damage to a persons complexion! You just need to look at my doorframe for proof."

"event","I suppose now is as good a time as any to announce that Nick and i are pregnant. On the 2nd June, so long as everything goes to plan, we will have a little us running around (well perhaps not running since they can't even hold their own heads up for months). All very exciting.

Nick has a new job starting monday as an IT technician at our local school starting monday, with all the school hols and a huge payrise. Just in time. Means i can go back to work part time in September provided the head agrees. They were talking about making redundancies this year and we are in excess of English teachers at my school, so looks hopeful. It's just the days that might be a problem. Would be great to never work a friday when the kids are at their worst, and have a 'long weekend' every weekend.

House DIY stuff is still going strong. In the process of putting in new doors, radiators, bathroom, wooden flooring. Hoping it will all be done by Christmas but not holding out much hope. Next step- the nursery!

Nearly there.

"event","After 2 years of hard work. I have finally taken my last exam and no longer have to formally prove my worth as a teacher. And better than that, the head marked me in Ofstead terms (big scary government people), and i actually got some elements of outstanding, which is nearly unheard of in any school. I feel a little pleased with me today. That also means i get a nice big sum of money in September, though unfortunately it isn't tax free.

Building will start on the house in the next three weeks to, so everything is finally coming together. Maybe me and Nick will be able to afford that honeymoon abroad this year afterall, even if it is a little late.

Hope you are a ll doing ok. Seems i don't have time to really talk to any of you anymore."

The wedding was totally magical. As soon as someone tells me how, i will definitely post pictures. Only hiccup was that we forget to take a copy of the song for our first dance. My brother and uncle are superhero's in their spare time though and flew to the nearest record shop to buy it, getting back just in time for the diner. Perhaps it wouldn't seem so bad if the DJ hadn't managed to get it already. All in all though, a great night had by everyone, and a new name for me. One that people can actually spell. Hoorah.

Thankfully the other person recognised me and i was let off.

My house is huge, or not huge depending on where you live, but is really nice. Three bedrooms, living room and dining room.Brad new kitchen which is absolutely gorgeous. The third bedroom is decorated with faeries, so is of course going to be my office, and the two gardens (front and back) are both bigger than the house, so i'm going to build a jungle in the back. We have a gorgeous tree in the front.


So i thought i was starting my six week holiday, and it turns out to be endless paperwork to mortgage people and solicitors. It will all be worth it in the end. Just hope me and Nick will still be able to afford to pay for the wedding."

"event","Very briefly cos i never update this thing so doubt anyone reads it anyway...

Passed my QTS literacy test second time and also passed my first term of teacher training. Only 5 more months to go.

Been working my arse off the last few months trying to keep up with all the work. Still not entirely convinced that it is all necessary or worth it but i shall continue regardless.

Christmas was ok. Been ill for the past two weeks, but then who was i kidding thinking i was actually going to have a healthy christmas. I've been ill every year since i was 16 and got glandular fever. Oh well. Starting to feel a little better now, and who knows, i might even be well in time to see my only two weeks holiday completely pass me by. I guess there is always easter. Maybe i'll catch rabbit flu or something in time for that.

Spent some of christmas day with nicks family but stayed at home for the most part since everyone got new games consoles and have been playing on them continuously. (Shrek 2 is about my level, but nearly completed it)

Nick got me a new stereo, so of course i had to buy a new tele combi thingy so i could actually fit it into my room. It's great. I'm getting all modernised.

Going to have dinner with nicks family tonight cos his parents have some friends coming up (who are indeed very lovely people) and they want us there.

that'll do.

Cheerybye


p.s. Happy new year to the people i like. I hope it sucks for the rest of you"

"event","I can hardly believe i am properly on my way to gaining myself a respectable career. Workload is unrelenting. I can't stop to fart between 6.30am and 9pm everyday. In between lesson planning and writing essays on Gardner and Vygotsky and multiple intelligences and doing other various but equally pointless tasks. I'm loving it though. Met some fantastic people and some incredibly odd children. I have no life anymore and Nick has had to resort to keeping himself amused by playing with LEGO.
I have my QTS skills tests this afternoon. Looking a bit iffy on whether or not i'll pass the maths test, but the others will be a breeze. At least the maths one is last. Save the dissapointment until the end.

I've started having loads of funny dreams again. Last night i was going to storm into a funeral home and tell them how disgusting i thought their behaviour was over the strie action, and i found myself in a huge dark fridge, and nick found a light so he switched it on. Their was this dead body on a slab (so i figure we are in a morgue) and the body is covered in stitches and he starts to get u[p and decides he is going to follow me so i get proper scared and start to run away cos the zombie guy says he is gonna marry me. (uh..no). Anyway, when i woke up i had managed to scare myself so much that Nick had to take me to the toilet. I'm quite concerned at the number of dreams i have started having again. It was all going so well. Atleast i'm not being raped now.


Hope this keeps you amused for a few minutes Devildoll. Sorry i don't have time to be more exiting."

They are a realy nice family that don't think they are better than me and don't try and tell me i am middle class just so that they feel less disgraced by me dating their son, even thoug they most definately are a middle class family who have done it on there own. I love Nicks family. They are really welcoming and great to talk to.

So i don't quite know when the wedding is going to be. We were hoping for next year, but because i'm going back to college it's going to be a fair bit longer than that. 

As soon as i can figure out how to do it i will post pictures of my ring.

The holiday was ok in the end. We went to a llama farm, and the owner has actually offered us a pretty good deal for when we wantto buy one. They are obviously well cared for there so i think we will most probably go back when we can afford the land for it. Lewes Castle was ok but a little dissapointing and overpriced. As is everything in England. Took a trip to the Dali museum in London, and that was amazing despite the fact there wasn't much of his famous stuff there. But nick has promised to take me to Spain so i can see all my favpurite original pictures hnging up. The holiday bit is a bonus.

I still have loads of work to do in preperation for uni, but i've decided not to srtess over it too much. Most of it is for my benefit anyway, so as long as i get the main bits done for the course on time i can work through the rest of it through the year. But i swear i have got grammatical exercises coming out of my ears and i'm really bored of them now."

Last night i spent my first night in 4 months completely alone. It sucked. I forgot that i have very few options for things to do with myself. I even had an extra shower to fill up half an hour. 

Long holidays are nice, but only if you can find something to do in them.

I'm going on holiday tomorrow and still haven't packed, don't really want to bother packing, or going for that matter. I don't especially want to do anything.

So this is the new plan:

I got offered a place at Portsmouth uni to do my PGCE in secondary english, so i have accepted and will be staying in Portsmouth for the next year. Never mind. But, i am going to be living rent free so will be loads richer and can finally pay off my humongous overdraft. Then i will apply all over the country and see where i get a job, and may even get an extra pay point for all my experience. (i should be so lucky)

Thought i might try to move to Poole or Bournemouth. I don't really wanna leave the beach or move to a city. Brighton's an option, but not really that sure. Might be a little trendy for me. Although i do have a wonderful friend there. 

<lj user=""devildoll_666""> is visiting next month so i am going to have to plan lots of lovely things for her to do. Of course meeting <lj user=""funnylittleman""> is top of the list. 

I SHOULD BE AT GLASTONBURY. I AM VERY CROSS!!!

And that is all the stuff i have to say. I swear i do more than this. My brain has been fried by insults and teenage boys today. Oh well."

Went to chaos a couple of times. Bumped into an old friend from cllege who i haven't seen for years. She's doing really well. Gonna meet up with her again soon. Very much loking forward to that.

Went bowling with Funnylittleman and managed to amash my old top score of 16. I actually got 43 points. Go me.
However, in the game of pool i played after i didn't manage to pot a single ball. Any gentleman would have lined up atleast one for me. 

Seen claireybell a few times which is always wonderful. 

Spent most of saturday watching my neighbour fix my car. New exhaust, shocks, tyre, and had to have hoses fiddled with on my engine to stop the petrol leaking out. But best of all, i can now wind down the driver window in my car and put it back up to it's original position again without it sticking out an inch from the door. Now to get it through the MOT.

Went to the new forest yesterday for a picnic with funnylittleman, purplechocolate, alex and their son. Had an ok time but my poor immune system made me poorly and grumpy an the weather turn cold.

Have found out that two of the options for university i put on my teaching  application have now been filled so i only have a 50% chance of getting a place anywhere. 

Things are great with me and flm. Though i have now become obsessed with seeing what my finger prints are like on everything thanks to his making me watch csi all the time. ( i love it really, it's just good to have someone else to blame for an obsession.)

And finally, mum and dad have gone to spain today, and flm and chris are going to homlands on the weekend so i m gonna be at a very loose end. Anyone who has a suggestion on what i could do, please feel free to voice it. Always open to suggestions."

Problems with my references stil. I have had to switch over my professional and academic people because Uni lecturers are far too busy to reply to all my unimportant little emails and phonecalls, but last hurdle jumped. 

Can't believe what a weight off that is. Now there is all the worry that despite vigilant checking of the form i have filled something in wrong somewhere like put a gorilla in my date of birth.

Nice way to end a pooey day. I hate teenage boys. Especially those named *** ******. Had to bleep for legal reasons. Sorry. But if anyone wants to beat him round the head with a baseball bat feel free.

And claireybell visits tonight so all is right with the world.

Charming boys. I love my job really.

nicknick has been so very helpful to me tis weekend. He cleaned my car and got all domesticated bringing the washing in off the line. He even cooked me dinner. Claireybell was also a wnderful friend as ever. And the pair of them hatched a plan of balloons and chocolate cake for my birthday. They are so very wonderful. Together with jack daniels from hayley and glittery straws everything was perfect. A lovely night with my closest and dearest friends. Anybody who idn't ome i wasn't really to arsed about anyway so there.

So to footie tonight. Another hour sat in my car freezing and smoking far to much whilst i wait for nick nick to come back al hot and sweaty and muscley and uhmmmmmm......

Took a trip up north to see the rellies and got stood up not once but twice on my birthday. Birthdays suck!!! You get older and more wrinkly and people buy you chocs and try to make you fat aswell. But then again, to quote belle and sebastian, ""i'd rather be fat than be confused"". So bring on the chocs man.

Party tomorrow night so here's hoping that makes up for it. I've been promised a bottle of champagne and a candle lit bath from funnylittleman afterwards, so he had better keep his promise. Being tood up a third time would be devastating. I'd actually start believing people reelly do hate me. 

Been spending a lot of time with funylittleman lately. Was watching a tv series called the funky squad last night with him. Wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. This show is sooo bad it has to be good. They actuaaly use words like groovy and funky and on the low down. Swinging hip cats.

(devildoll_666), missing you like crazy. Come visit me when you are back over. I promise i will send you a letter throug the postie soon. I have to find some interesting things to put in it first though. I found a drink named boobee (tehehe. boobies), but figured they would be a little heavy to post. They taste nasty anyway.

Balberith, hope you are feeling better. I understand man flu is very horrible.

Claireybell, missed you. Can't wait to see you tomorrow. That goes for you to sir john_potter.

"event","i'm in my living room freezing, symbolic of how my life has been and how i feel inside. cold. i feel like im missing something. my relationship with god is good.  so i should feel complete, but i dont. something is missing. havent figured it out, but its not there. and i feel cold inside. i feel as if i'm that person who will always be there for you because my life hasnt changed. that i'll always be there for you when you are stuck at the side of the road. and i will, believe me, i just want it to be different this time around. 


Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find, you and I collide

"event","i'm so over everything right now. friends, situations that never fix themselves even with my desire to fix them, and just so much other stuff. i never imagined life could do this. my life is crazy. i'm so frustrated i can't even talk-describe-put into words how i feel. 
i tend not to talk about my feelings because i have a sense about people when they don't care or aren't listening, because my mom doesnt listen. but i know god listens. and a few of my friends tell me they listen, and i guess its my problem if i dont believe them.

"event","my initial plan was to come on here and complain about how much my life isn't going the way i've wanted it to go, and how i'm not happy because i haven't had a boyfriend ever(!) and that i have just been down because rejection can be just too much to handle when everything else is too much. its just so much more than what i let on. iam so ready for a peaceful life .then i read justine's post and i lost my train of thought, and i cried. more like sobbed. i sobbed on the way home from michael's too. sure, life sucks, but, its those friends who fill your heart with the hope to carry on one more day, and its those friends who encourage you when you feel like you can't go on because your heart has been broken in pieces. i am so ready to be loved, and to love somebody. i love god, and believe me, i know hes enough. but i have waited an incredible amount of time for someone to come along. i have to tell myself, even i dont want to, maybe there is someone out there for me. geez. someday. so, i'm gonna work on my patience. pray that i don't lose hope and i focus on god, who is in control of my life, whether i see it or don't see it due to my ignorance.

justine. you are amazing yourself. your gift of encouragement and discernment gets me everytime. you amaze me with your love of god, and the faith you show with your beautiful heart. i cant wait to see what god is going to do in your life. and i'll be home to see it. :)

"event","okay, yesterday was so emotionally charged. i drove home from sb, and i convinced michael to hang out with me instaed of going to work. so he went tanning or whatever, and then he wanted to go get his check from hollister. no biggie right? wrong. i was wearing this skimpy tanktop without a bra on, and i didn't want to go in to the mall with out a sweatshirt. so i borrowed a sweatshirt, and i ended up looking like crap. i HATED the way i looked. i had no makeup on, and i was so digusted. as we were leaving the mall, i started to cry cause i was so mad at myself for leaving and going out like this. and i felt bad, because mike didn't know what to do, and i don't think he understood why i was crying. but its okay, cause everyone needs a good cry. i'm feeling nauseous   right now. bleh..

last night at church was so much fun. it was the pumpkin toss, where you throw a pumpkin from the second story, on to a trapoline and try to make it to a trash can. it was so funny, except that holvin freakin' almost hit me in the face with his huge carving of his and brian's faces. it was really funny. we all then played this massive dodgeball game in the gym. i got decked in the face by john(too bad i might like him:/) but it was worth it. 

tonight, jessica, seth, mike and i are going on another midgettown escapade. should be fun, and after that mike and i are going to find roadsigns for our respective rooms. yes."

"event","so i bought a crap load of stuff from ikea on sunday.i don't care what anyone says, i love buying stuff, and yeah, it is a good feeling. and i bought oceans 11 on dvd, and the whole cast of that movie is hot. this weekend was so laid back, and i loved almost every minute of it. i saw my family because it was my grandma's funeral, and it was really nice to see them. my cousins lisa and greg were there, and its odd, cause we all look alike, and they are in their thirties. mike came along, and freaked out when i forgot to introduce him as my friend to my aunt. he said, 'do you want your whole family to think were going out?' it was two people, i guess two too many. i lost my keys this weekend at the block. i freaked out. i didn't know what to do, but mike's friend jeff and i went to lost and found and behold, they were there. a lot more happened too, i just am worn out."

"event","A pictures worth a thousand words
But not worth the words I need to hear
I miss you so much that it hurts
And tonight, I wish you were here with me
So I could make you see
The stars, they lay across the sky so perfectly
And they remind me of
All the times, when we used to sit underneath them, those summer nights
And fall in love

It's not alright, it's our last night together
I won't give up, I can't let go, of you. 
I can't let go of you.

And tonight, 
I close my eyes and dream that he is still the one,
laying there beside me
I'd walk a thousand miles
I'd swim across the sea
What do I have to do, please just tell me

It's not alright, it's our last night together
I wont give up , I can't let go,  of you
I can't let go of you"

"event","i just woke up from the most amazing dream. i drempt that in my dream, i was at a memorial service for some extended family member, and i met one of my cousins friends who was as close to being family as you could get. we were at my busia's house, and just all hanging out waiting for this service which was the next day. and i re-met this guy, because evidently, we had a past, and i guess we hooked up or something like that. and i remember that at my busia's house, we just sat and talked for hours and hours about the deepest stuff. i felt so close. it was awesome. i still couldn't remember his name either. i think it was alex, ryan or mike, something with four letters. so, the next day, the service was at el torito (don't ask), and about 200 of my closest family was there, and i sat next to him. but, half way through the service, my cell phone started going off, and i wasn't able to turn it off, and everyone started looking around to see who's it was, and people knew it was mine. five minutes passed by, when all of a sudden, another phone in my purse went off, and it looked like my laptop. i started to cry, and it was weird. but, thats not the amazing part. the amazing part, is that alex, mike or ryan, the whole time was sitting there, holding my hand, rubbing my shoulders, wiping my tears off and telling me how amazing iam. it was so great. i really didn't want it to end, but joelle called. it seriously seemed SO real. but then i thought about it. i do have that, because god treats me like that. and someday, maybe, i will have that. i will have that guy to hold my hand and guide me when i lose confidence in myself, or to rub my back after a long day at work. i can't wait for that. then i was wondering if i know him now, or will he be revealed later. i can't wait, but i don't want to hope. i just want him to revealed now, so he can help me through things, so he can love me for who i am. i want to be the best girlfriend/wife/friend/lover/counselor that this man has ever encountered. it may sound cheesy, but i guess a dream can change your outlook on love and hoping that hey, maybe, i might get a shot at love. 
someday, the man my dreams will come along (literally)"

on sunday, it was so great! i saw dan palmer, and dave, brian, josh, monet, darren, scott, dan and i all went to patricia's, the best place EVER. it was awesome. dan made fun of because of my lingo(i.e: swift, boss). i was singing 'your name is holy' and dan started to sing 'you name is boss' because of how i said patricia's was 'boss'. hahahaha. oh my gosh. i'm laughing so hard thinking about it. it was so FUNNY. i remember winter camp 01' when dan and scott prayed with me to receive christ. i remember it because dan couldn't talk. he still has his raspy voice. dan is so awesome, but it sucks that he doesn't live down here, cause i would be hanging out with his son, who is the cutest ever(hes like 2). it was so awesome to be able to catch up. it got my mind off of how tired i was from saturday, which was the most pointless day/night except that joelle and i hung out on the car ride home from SB. i was/am so emotional. i don't like many people or things right now. i'm sick of making a tired effort. its not worth it if i'm going to be taken for granted...

I found a line and then it grew
I found myself still thinking of you
I felt so empty and now I'm fine
But still it's burning when will you be mine?

I think its time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think its time for us to walk away from here

Stories in our lives, we keep them all inside
Stories in our lives, we keep them all inside

Look at me, still in your mind
Our memories, so intertwined
Well you broke through, you found your way
And so did I, no need to stay
In the same old picture, tried and true
We've been through that, let's look for something new

Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night?
Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night?
Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you?
All the songs that I have wrote for you
For you

I remember the way you made me feel when I was with you
I remember the smile that always brought me back to you
That look in your eyes,
I never thought that this could be untrue
That look in your eyes
I never thought that this could be untrue
Untrue

i missed home a little bit today. i figured that since i talked to mike and my mom...it was only blatant. joelle and i might come home this weekend, i haven't decided. i'm tired now, so it makes me less ambitious to drive on saturday. who knows we'll see. when i go home, the only people i really want to hang out with are never around, so i don't know if there is a point besides seeing my mom who is an emotional basket case. so who knows. maybe, maybe not. pray for me that i stay motivated here. i didn't go to math today...i hate that guy anyway.

lately though, i have been thinking about relationships a lot.  does god desire me to get married and be a soccer mom with four kids and an SUV? i'm analyzing this question so much. when you transition into college, it crazy. it hits you that this is when everyone gets married, and hey, i might be next if i do this or that different.

"event","I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done.

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, Light up
As if you have a choice 
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
It makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do.

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower, slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess.

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear.

<P>camp was <STRONG>so</STRONG> great.</P>
<P>&nbsp;i got to know so many new people. it was so fun just to hang out by the water and the sand, and to cause trouble. steve, rachel, susie and brian and i shot a skunk with an airsoft gun. then, it pissed all over there tent. haha. harmony, steph and i shared a tent, which was funny because harmony and i are so much alike, and steph isn't anything like us. so we always would&nbsp;be talking and bug her (unintentionally). and we had this mirror on a string hanging from the center of our tent. haha. we also bought all this toilet paper from wal-mart, and we didn't get to use it. on the last night of camp, we played all these games, and it was so outrageous. clumps, lazer eyes, and the infamous ten-finger game. i got to know tons of cool people though. and i had a blast. harmony and i left this morning at 6:30 am, and it was fun. i slept, and i saw anchorman, the funniest movie ever. afterwards, i went to resonate, and the worship was simply awesome. now, i'm at justin's house, hanging with him and ken, the smart asian guy who got into yale. well, i'm out now.</P>

<DIV><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#00cccc size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#00cccc size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#00cccc size=2>.the cross--Scott and Jesse and the rest of the adult leaders talked at this cross on the hillside. It was freezing, and it was up a hill. so, once again, enough said.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT color=#00cccc><FONT size=2><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"">I'm going to <STRONG>TRY </STRONG>to recap everything that happened. I had such an amazing time.&nbsp;I didn't know that God could work in so many different ways. When we first got there&nbsp;I was so pumped, but Jeff and Adam kept pissing me off, and Scott was being sarcastic in his little ways. So it didn't seem that optimistic. But then John and&nbsp;I had a talk at dinner about how he has been through hard things, and it was really cool to be able to talk to him. After that, we had a campfire and the kids talked about the day.&nbsp;I</FONT><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"">&nbsp;went to bed, and then woke up <STRONG>FREEZING</STRONG>!&nbsp; The sleeping bag that Erin let me borrow broke and&nbsp;I had no zipper. The next day we started on our construction, and our team had to build this massive trench down a hill.&nbsp;I then got sent over to try to get this wire out of the ground, after Scott of course broke a pipe. I, then was hauling about fifty pounds of rocks up a hill in to a pile. The same thing pretty much happened the next day, except Wednesday night we laughed so hard together in our cabin about the most ridiculous things. I also rested from that massive hike that we went on. It was a blast though. Friday was the beach day, and the night that I had to share my testimony to the whole group. That was probably the funniest/weird day ever. We went to this park that smelled like poo. Justine, Kaitlynn and Brian and I went to this GHETTO soccer/dirt field. This nino kicked the ball up, and Brian and I went for it, and I got knocked in the head and I guess I had a minor concussion. It didn't help anymore because the day before, I was heading 50 yard (in the air) boots by Scott in&nbsp;the cabesa. It was just outrageous. Courtney and&nbsp;I had a great conversation on the beach. So did Kyle and I. He is so amazing. He kept me sane, because&nbsp;I was going insane the whole trip, and&nbsp;I all&nbsp;I did was vent to him. He had really insightful and great things to say to me the whole trip, along with his testimony.&nbsp;I was pretty nervous when&nbsp;I had to get up there to share. Plus I was cold, so it didn't make for the best of circumstances. Today was also an amazing day. We just talked about things and I worked things out with people. It was awesome. Okay. I'm&nbsp;waay too tired to go on anymore. If you want to know more, just ask me. It was simply amazing. Everyone needs to experience life in a different way. </FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV>"

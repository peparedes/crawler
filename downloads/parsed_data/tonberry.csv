<b>The Kayest</b> (tentative name!) of Magtheridon-US is recruiting the following: 1 resto druid, 1 tank (any except DK), and 1 mage. We will also consider a holy pally. This would be a permanent spot for our 10m core group. We raid Tues-Thurs from 9:30-12:30 Eastern time, with possible schedule adjustment if necessary. We are a brand new guild (level 1 bitches!) but we'll be leveling quickly. As for us: 

Raid experience: We are a group of friends who have been raiding together since around Ulduar. A couple of us have experience with end-game raiding in vanilla/TBC. Our raid leader raided in a top 100 guild Naxx thru the end of Ulduar, before coming to raid with us. We've got experience raiding TOGETHER with HM TOGC/ICC, and we are all experienced with the majority of Cata content. Our personal experiences vary from being 10/12 to 5/13 HM. We know our shit, but we're willing to teach a fast learner new content. :) We haven't started raiding yet, as we want to fill out a little more so we don't have to pug, but we expect to be 10/12 within the first 2 weeks.

More personal stuff: We're a bunch of easy-going kids. We're pretty hardcore about achievements. We love love looove to PVP and are hoping to do some rated BGs. We hang out in vent and chat pretty much every night. We are NOT super PC, and people easily offended shouldn't join. We like to talk about casual recreational drug use, make fun of each other, and talk about pronz. That said, we'll never judge somebody so we're cool in that sense, as long as you aren't super sensitive about being teased.

The server: We just transferred to Magtheridon from Onyxia. It's an EST server. Also a PVP server. There's a decent amount of progression, and I think two guilds on the server (1 horde, 1 ally) that are 13/13. It's pretty evenly balanced between horde and alliance, which means really epic Tol Barad battles, and lots of world PVP. Economy is a bit expensive, but it's really just an active, good server.

If you're interested, you can comment here and let me know! If you want to roll an alt and hang out with us in guild, that'd be rad! :D Let me know! &hearts;"

"event","I'm in Vermont until Monday. Mmm, delicious Chili's. I love you.

That said, I've been raging hardcore all day about Blizzard's decision to change a really difficult achievement in WoW. For those that don't play: you can gain reputation with different factions in the game, by doing quests, killing certain enemies, turning in items to them, etc. There are, of course, 3 expansions. With the newest expansion, they introduced a title called Insane in the Membrane. It's a ""feat of strength"", which means it's more difficult than regular achievements, and doesn't reward any points for completing it: all you get is the title ""the Insane"" added after your name.

Insane involves basically being exalted (the highest level of reputation) with a bunch of factions from the first expansion that really offer no real reward. There are some factions in the game where, if you're exalted, you can buy certain items from them that are only available at the highest level- like little pets that will follow you, certain foods that give buffs, or enchantments for your gear. The reputations required for this achievement give, quite literally, no real benefit other than the meta requirement for the title. 

Blizzard's new expansion that's coming out, Cataclysm, is completely revamping the original zones in the game. This means that one of the factions, a group of really annoying elves called the Shendralar, is being removed from the game. People, of course, bitched on the forums, so Blizzard decided to completely remove the requirement for reputation with this faction, and by doing so keep the achievement available in the game into the new expansion.

Except, this particular reputation grind is probably about 30% of the work that goes into the title. You have to farm certain books that have a very low (around 1%) drop rate off ogre enemies within a certain dungeon. Then you have to turn them in with a certain diamond that has a low drop rate (again, 1%) from ANOTHER dungeon, along with one of three other items, depending on what kind of book (there are three) you have, which, of course, drop from a whole OTHER dungeon. You could of course choose to buy 2 of the 3 items (the third one required is Bind on Pickup, meaning you can't sell/trade it) but that would cost you an obscene amount of gold. It's a total of around 90 turn ins, so you have to come up with the materials to turn in 94 times.

I am seriously infuriated that Blizzard is changing it. Anyone who plays WoW knows that Blizz feels the need to ""nerf"" content so that ~~everyone~~ can experience the same gameplay, regardless of how hardcore or skilled they are. If they want to add a 30% damage/health buff to the final raid of the game, go for it. The more skilled players have hard modes of the same encounters to challenge them, with better loot and really awesome titles (""The Light of Dawn"" for example.) But feats of strength were ALWAYS designed to be a bit of a symbol of ""elitism."" Insane is not hard, it's really damn time consuming, though. I spent a good portion of my time between January and September of this year working on it.

I'm so, so angry that Blizzard feels the need to cater to people who ""DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME"" to finish Insane in the almost two years provided. The title isn't for the ""casual"" player who puts a few hours in a week. It's honestly for people who are willing to spend DAYS, maybe even WEEKS, of played time into it. 

Then they have the audacity to say, ""well for the people who got exalted reputation with the faction being removed, there will be a feat of strength added for you <i>at some point in the future, but we don't know when yet.</i>"" I didn't get Insane for the feat of strength that is worth no actual points. I worked for the TITLE that I can show off. I don't have any desire to run around saying ""YEAH WELL INSPECT ME AND LOOK AT MY ACHIEVEMENTS, YOU SEE THAT FEAT OF STRENGTH, I GOT INSANE PRE-NERF!"" 

This is not good customer service. You don't piss off the ""hardcore"" portion of your fanbase. We're the ones who will buy the Collector's Edition for an extra $50. We're the ones who will pay for server transfers, faction changes, race changes, character renames. We're the ones buying the optional non-combat pets off the store, or the sparkle pony mounts. We're the ones who cut corners to keep our subscriptions up when we're short on money, because it's our favourite hobby.

What do casuals do? They get bored with the game, cancel their subscriptions for a few months, and do other things. 

Also, just to drive the hypocrisy home: in previous expansions, from TBC to Wrath, for example, a lot of feats of strength were made unobtainable. There was a mount you could get from a ""timed"" run of a raid that was removed for Wrath, as well as other titles that required TBC-related achievements. So if they have no issue removing other achievements- why keep this one in?

Fuck this. This is why I can't have nice things. >:|

I wish there was somewhere I could bitch to that would care. I want to see Blizz suffer for this, damnit.

Things that have happened since I last updated:

-I gave my notice at work. July 28th will be my last day. Actually... it might be a lot sooner than that. :x Without giving details before I know what I'm doing.

-I went to Vermont for the 4th of July! \o/ Pics will be included.

-Adam and I drove back from Vermont to NB on Tuesday evening. Finally saw the new apartment that I will be living in this fall with Matt while we attend UNBSJ for business! It's fucking gorgeous and I love it, though I suspect it may be haunted.

-Yesterday was Adam's birthday! I am a good girlfriend and bought him ice cream cake and baked him some homemade lasagna. 

-Tomorrow we're going to SJ to start moving stuff, and to have a ~~family dinnahz~~ cos yeah, Adam and I will probably never break up despite our occasional relationship issues. We'll probably end up getting married at some point so it'd be good to know the families and all that.

Tbh, I'm a little apprehensive about it all, but after 4+ years of vowing that we'll get a place together, I kinda have to just <i>because</i>.

I hope she is though. :x Gonna miss the city and my friends, NOT gonna miss staying at Matt's. ~_~ IDK how he still lives at home, I'd go crazy.

I still need ~20-30 decks, but Vaegren finished hers tonight. She sent me all her cards, and now I'm like one card away from several (at least 10) more decks. I've also resorted to spamming trade offering 500g per Chaos/Prisms deck (I've got like 12k to blow so why not!) and also Jikate, the resident AH player of Onyxia, has expressed interest in helping me out with finding cards cos he and I have a pretty sweet deal going on (I sell him epic gems for fairly cheap all the time) and yeah.

After DMF, the rest of this rep grind will be a breeze. Even Ravenholdt can't be this bad. Especially since I have a TON of pristine black diamonds (I need MAYBE 10 more), it'll mostly just be a lot of Dire Maul runs from here until I'm Theos the Insane. :)

I must admit, the holiday hit me hard. I wasn't really thinking much about it, tbh, until it actually arrived.

I don't identify, really, as a Canadian to the extent that I should, maybe. I consider it, more or less, to be lolcanada. Something that I, and my guildies, poke fun at constantly. When it comes down to it, I'm damn glad to be living in this country. I may move someday... but even if I end up in the US or something, I know that this country has shaped me into the person I am. My liberal views, and my fundamental beliefs. I really am a true, proud Canadian at heart.

I wasn't going to watch the opening ceremonies. I actually missed some of it. But I ended up, eventually, streaming it live from the internet. And honestly... I have been moved to <i>tears</i>. I am so proud of my country right now. I am so, so beaming with this unexpected pride and joy that I can be alive to see my country host the Olympic games. I don't care about sports... but that isn't what it really is about, to me. It's about coming together as a country, doing something world-wide that is actually PEACEFUL for once. 

God bless Canada, my country and my home. &hearts;

In other news... I had a good day. I went to work for a potluck lunch, and everyone wanted the recipe for the squares I brought in, yei! Then I went shopping with a coworker and spent moar money than I had been expecting to. >.> New bras and pantehs, pillows, shoes, boots, socks, and some food. Then I put a preorder down on FF13, and my boyfriend, whom I love to death might I add, offered to pay for the rest of it, since he'll be here when it comes out anyway. 

I turn 22 in a week. I still... well, I don't feel as though I'm mature enough for my age. So many of my friends are graduating college this year, married, expecting children... and well. I work at a hotel, can barely pay my rent, and don't really know where I'm going. But I'm getting better. I saw a creditor about fixing my credit card debt, and I think I'm working something out with them which is yay. And yeah, I have 4 days off for my birthday, I will probably smoke a lot of weed with Matt, and then on the 5th of March, I will have an Adam here and we can play video games and cuddle and yei. &hearts;

-kill pirates in Tanaris until out of hated (currently ~9k/36k hated)
-free knot in Dire Maul from friendly - exalted
-while in Dire Maul, pickpocket mobs, then kill them for libram farming
-in the meantime, buy librams/pristine black diamonds off the AH (I bought 7 of them yesterday, and 3 diamonds)
-moar pickpocketing here and there. I'm borrowing a friend's rogue to do this as well.
-spend ALL OTHER FREE TIME farming herbs in Scholazar to mill and turn into cards. Sell nobles decks and any frost lotus herbed, turn all other decks in for Darkmoon Faire rep.

-BE THEOS THE INSAAAAAAAAAAANE

I'll admit, I've traded most of my frost emblems in for saronite to fund this ridiculous undertaking. I have my bank alt parked at the AH and another alt at the Alliance AH to watch for librams. I'll go up to ~150g for a libram or a diamond. I still need 76 turn ins to buy/farm. HMMM.

THIS WILL BE EPIC. AND SO WORTH IT. :D"

"event","I got Dainty to 70 and NAO SHE HAS BLOODLUST.

An entertaining story. I've been frustrated to all hell with her, to the extent where I didn't want to get her from 68-80. Healing isn't that fun when you're leveling, and her dps was just. Bad. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. I was using water shield, flametongue weapon, dropping totems, spamming lightning bolt... all those good things shammies should do.

Heather starts ranting to me about the glitch with dual spec not updating the levels of your abilities on your bars when you learn them in your off spec... suddenly it hits me. I'd leveled from like level 40ish until 68 as resto...

Sure enough, I was casting level 5 lightning bolt the entire time. Switched all my bars out for the proper ranks (level 12 lightning bolt lawl) and now I'm pulling over 1k dps in instances. :D Stuff dies SO FAST lsdkjfdlk I love burst damage casters. &hearts;&hearts;

I'll probably get her to 80 in a week or so, though Danielle has Wrath now and she's leveling Kittenpants with meh! So we will see! I am excited to have my third 80. :)

Also Theos is geared to the teeth at this point. Almost broke a 3000 Wowheroes gearscore and I'm second in guild by 4 freakin' points. I wanna get him the exalted AV ring and then his first piece of t10 on Tuesday. Woot. :'D

Bed now. We have 3 hockey teams staying at the hotel, it's something like 48 rooms, and tomorrow is gonna be a DISASTER ZONE. I predict it to be a bad weekend - probably late days tomorrow and Sunday when they all actually... check out. So many pizza boxes... D:

I am a geared hunter. I pull a lot of threat. It's what I do. If all my shit procs at once, I have a whole lot of explosive shots, and something like 3400 agility. I understand that if I cannot manage this and pull aggro, then I die and it's my own damn fault. 

But for you to get on my case and tell me to NEVER use Misdirect in a 5 man instance? What the hell. Am I telling YOU how to manage YOUR threat, as the tank? No. Why the hell would you get on my case about mine, then? More importantly, why would you flip out about me using an ability that helps you? ""You shouldn't have to MD in a 5 man instance, ever.""  

Oh, okay. I guess that 6.8k I just pulled on that boss doesn't pull any threat at all.

"event","This is a post of... I don't know. There's a lot going on in my life in Fredericton. Apart from the job-hunting thing, I really do enjoy it, and it keeps me busy. I've made a few great friends. Met someone who makes me go all &hearts; inside (though we won't get into that lulz). But you know what? Sometimes, like tonight, I just feel myself ready to cry because I'm homesick. 

Not homesick for the things most kids are. I have no desire to see my dad now, nor ever. Lisa and I... well, I guess we had some good moments, but she lives her own life and I've no desire to intrude into it. It's my mom I miss more than anything. Even though we yell at each other and hate each other sometimes and blame each other for stuff--even though I got all my negative traits from her and she's probably picked up on a lot of mine over the years too. I got a lot of good things from my mom. 

I got my sense of humor from my mom. I got my love of books from my mom, always reading to me when I was something like two. My mom taught me to read when I was really little, and that love has <i>always</i> continued with me. I got my mom's imagination-- if I'm ever published, there will be so many thanks to her in that book, I swear. I got my passion from my mom; and while sometimes that hot temper can cause trouble, I got my sensitivity, my compassion, and everything else from her too. I guess you can say I got my humanity from her.

We've had so many arguments over the years, I could never keep count. I remember the bitterest of them, of course, and for a while, I wanted to hate my mom because of it. But I can't hate her for it - it's always half my fault, at least. That's why when we argue, it's so explosive. We're so similar, we have the same reaction, and we egg each other on. We both have an astounding ability to stress, blow things out of proportion, exaggerate the situation. 

But my mom--she's always been there for me. Even when reluctantly, even when I took it as an attack because she was trying to help. She, alone, has cared when I really needed it. My mom's saved my life in so many ways. And even though she probably hates the endless calls she gets from me every day, now that I'm in Fredericton, and she's in Riverview, I appreciate them so much. My mom gives me the encouragement to keep going. Even though I feel like a failure, I just want to succeed so that I can help my mom, too. I hate that I have to rely on her... I want to be the one she can rely on. 

This is cheesy and long and... I don't even know where I'm going with it. Just typing this shit brings back so many memories--good and bad--but in the end, ya know what? The good do outweigh the bad. I've been a crazy burden my whole life, and I do miss those few years of peace where I was just a good kid, not causing shit and drama. I know they were only a few brief years but... 

I'm sorry to my mom for all the shit I ever did. I'm sorry for all the shit I continue to get myself into. But in the end? I just miss my mom. I should be a grown adult making my own way or something, but instead I just wish I could go hang with my mom forever. :( Or at least go curl up with her when I'm feeling miserably homesick for... I don't even know what home. Just for a world that might have ended up slightly differently had various different things happened in the past. 

I was on an abortion forum a couple of weeks ago, debating with the women's rights to abort. Someone replied ""unless you can honestly believe you'd support your own mother's decision to have aborted YOU, you can't talk."" Ignoring the whole ""that question makes no sense since I can't question my mother if i'm not even alive"", I really am grateful to my mom for having me. For dealing with me. I had so many issues as a kid -- and I still have them. And even on the days where I want to die (they're not as frequent as they used to be since I cut Amanda out of my life), I'm grateful that my mom exists and hopefully loves me just as much as I love her. 

I really do love you, mom. I know I don't act it, but I'll probably die if my mom does. 

And I miss her. :( All I want to do is succeed since she's the only real family I've got, and I want to make her proud. 

I hope I can pull my future together and make something of myself, for that reason alone. &hearts;"

Theos won't ever let the memory of Silvermoon, and the hardships of his people, die away. Theos of the Shattered Sun, in front of the monument, atop his white hawkstrider on the Isle of Quel'Danas. :3

Yes, I totally hit exalted with the Shattered Sun Offensive and immediately dished out the 1000 gold for the title. It was totally worth it."

My lucky streak is beginning to weird me out. o_O I duo'd H MgT with Coby today, since she already had the mount, and I was pretty much in shock that it actually dropped. 

Mount #85. 15 to go!"

"event","Atelka and I... do not get along. I feel like shit, because I feel like I'm once again going in circles. I called mom to talk abuot it, and she made me promise to just never work in a call center again. I don't have the thick skin to work in one, and deal with people spazzing at me about their $2000 cell phone bills because they used their iPhones in the US or whatever. I cried four times today, and threw up twice! Really, there's no point in making excuses, I'm just not the right person to be working in a call center.

I'll decide tomorrow if I'm going to quit or try and stick through it. Whatever I decide, I get paid today, so I am taking the rent and gas money out, and giving it to Chelsea now so that I'm covered up until December 1st. :) Most of my bills are paid off, so I'm really not too worried. 

My main concern is that I don't let myself get into a rut of unemployment, like I've fallen victim to before. I applied at Subway and Zellers today. I'm dropping off resumes at the Smythe St Superstore, McDonalds (yes, i'm that desperate!) and Tim Hortons tomorrow. I would honestly rather slave in the food industry than let angry Indian (no offense to anyway) customers spaz at me, belittle me, and treat me like shit about somethign that's out of my hands. I'm already on Ativan for my anxiety, and it's to the point where I am an adult, and I need to make an adult decision about whether or not I want to be miserable, or if I just want to suck up not spending my money on things like computers, clothes, and material possessions for another pay until I've got something I can tolerate/maybe even enjoy. 

Thinking about it that way, I don't feel so bad. :)

I will get by. I just gotta get out there and apply for everything I see that doesn't make me feel like I'm out of control of the situation!

Thanksgiving is this weekend, still don't know what I'm doing. Contrary to what I said before, I raided tonight with the guild. Got no loot. T9 hunter gloves dropped, but I have the less-awesome-T9 gloves already, so I passed to the hunter who didn't have any T9 yet. It felt good, even though some small part of me wanted to loot whore them. :(

My life is pretty boring. I'm looking forward to applying for jobs tomorrow. I hope the weather is nice, I am gonna walk across the bridge. :3 Fredericton is so fucking gorgeous in the fall, I really should get out and take some photos. 

Peace out LJ.

He was all hyper and happy and had fluffy ears and huge fluffy paws!!! I want one of those dogs sooo badly now. I prefer big dogs, but cocker spaniels are so adorable OMFG. &hearts;

I'm out of training tomorrow at Atelka. I hate that job, I'm going to apply at fucking McDonalds tomorrow 'cos I'd rather work there. >.< I'm applying for a 3 AM - noon shift at the Tim Hortons down the road. I think that'd be sweet.

Hmmm. Other than that. Had a ""bad movie night"" with Sarah tonight... which basically consisted of Cruel Intentions and Disturbia and lots of nacho dip. =P Chels was really drunk, and she provided side entertainment....

I'm getting sick of WoW. :\ My account expires tomorrow and I'm once again debating if I want to renew it or not... 

Oh, and Thanksgiving is this weekend and I think my mom's gonna be in Freddytown. I'm excited to cook a fancy dinner for us! Well, not quite fancy, but... meh. it'll be decent! If my mom's not here, I'm going to SJ to hang out with my Matt! We'll see what happens~ In the meantime, Imma pop some Ativan to survive work tomorrow.

Peace out LJ! &hearts;

"event","After a night of raiding with my new guild, I'm just... ugh. Disheartened. :\

My DPS is shit. And it's not because I don't have a solid rotation, or because I don't have decent gear (it's not great, only a gearscore of like 2350, but ya know), or because I'm lacking flasks/buffs/whatever. It's because I've got such bad framerate on this piece of shit laptop. :(

5fps cannot make a raiding experience the slightest bit enjoyable. Half the time I can't see my global cooldown. Half the time I can't even fucking click on the right target. And let alone fights that require movement. Twins in TOC? I couldn't even SEE the orbs for teh raid buffs. :\ Anub? I could barely see the stupid frost orbs. And let's not even get started on Uld.... ugh. 

I've mostly done 10m raids before this, and this is why. I could handle Naxx/OS/whatever because there's not a lot of movement involved, but... blah. :(

I'll hopefully have a huge pay after this one ($700ish) and this pay on Thursday isn't a bill pay, apart from groceries and my cell, so I might try and swing getting a new computer. :\ Nothing fantastic, but fuck I'm depressed and feel inadequate. Especially since I'm currently a trial raider, and this definitely isn't giving them a good impression. But what can I say? ""Sorry, I can't see what's going on and that's why my DPS sucks?"" Yeeeeah. :\

FML.

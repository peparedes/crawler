"event","had a bad day
sing it mcmahon
had a bad day again
keep singin it

desires linger as i fall
beneath
my salty soul tumbling
tumbling
tumbling
down to the floor
crashing
an explosion from one drop
i wonder if thats how it happens
with a bomb
everythng in slow motion
then it lands
and chaos
take flight

everything is in pain
breathing comes slow and ragged
heart beats slow slow slow
chest feels heavy
too weak to hold this burden
i have given myself

get this out of my body
write it down
let it out
doesnt work
still sick still spinning
in circles
endless endless
circles
i need a cigarette


'lights out on division street' she sings to me"

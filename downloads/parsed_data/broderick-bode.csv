"event","<p align=""justify"">'Ello there! My name's Broderick Bode. I'm not sure if everyone reading this knows me or not ... I'm sure my fellow 'Claws do though. I'm in my Seventh Year and I'm a proud Ravenclaw.

Ah! My last year of Hogwarts. It's interesting Dumbledore gave us this assignment. I figured it'd be interesting to try out. Perhaps I'll get to meet some new people and see a few new faces. The halls of Hogwarts are very much filled and I'd like to get to know more of the faces I see everyday. I'm not sure if I'm excited to get out of this place or not. I'm sure I'll find that out when the year ends. That'll sure come sooner than later. <s>I'm more than less prepared. This has been my home for so long.</s>

Enough about that, let's talk about me. I enjoy Quidditch and learning new things. I live in Scotland. I rather like it there ... but I'd like to move else where - closer to more Wizarding things. I don't care much about blood. <s>Basically because I'm not sure of my own.</s> My Father died when I was young. It's just been me and my Mother for as long as I can remember. I'm alright with that. I'm basically searching for some answers. I don't have much family. Just me and my Mother.

Anyway. I suppose that's enough talk about me.

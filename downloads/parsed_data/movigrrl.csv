With this Bachelor's degree, that is.

Wrote my last final on Wednesday and it was pretty good.  And considering I needed 20% to get a B, I think I did all right in the course.

No one told me that I might get a little emotional when I was finished.  It hadn't really sunk in at all in the days leading up to my last final that I would be *done*.  So, finished writing my Russian language final at about 10:45 am, went to the washroom and promptly burst into tears.  Very, very weird.  I'm not a crier at all, but, yeah, there was a little weeping.  I don't think it helped that I hadn't got a very good sleep the night before, but still.  Weeping??  WTF?

So, now that I'm done, I'm cleaning.  Cleaning every room in my apartment.  Okay, it's a one-bedroom, but both my bedroom and living room are large.  Sorting through notes, and notes, and notes.  I've sorted the things I'm never going to read again into scrap paper piles and junked un-scrap-paperable-paper.  I have a stack about 4 inches tall of paper that is beautifully pristine on one side ... and four paper cuts that required bandaids and two that are small enough they don't need bandaids.

My conclusion:
5 years and about $45,000 gets you three little letters behind  your name, reams of scrap paper, and paper cuts.

And, you know, some knowledge and experience that might get you a job.  Hopefully.

Boy howdy! You're such a martyr! Poor self-righteous and misunderstood Krycek, you're an unsung talent in the X-Files world. Mulder is an idiot and a creep, Scully's just as bad, and the only reason the whole world hasn't collapsed by now is because of you. You've made incredible self-sacrifices in order to maintain the balance of good and evil and save the day, and it's about time the rest of the characters knew about it! Usually when you have sex with Mulder, it's because you're being forced, but don't let that stop your writers from making you a god in the sack. After all, as perfect and misunderstood and maligned as you are, it just makes sense that you'd be pure sex on legs. You're perfect, Self-Righteous and Misunderstood Martyr Cliche Krycek!

So, I'm off to my parents' house for the holidays.  Finished my last exam today (it was super easy) and went and saw Star Trek Nemesis.  Forgot how much I love Star Trek.

Obituary 

Glenn Quinn, 32; Actor Was in TV Series 'Roseanne' and 'Angel'
by Dennis McLellan

Glenn Quinn, best known for his recurring role on the sitcom ""Roseanne"" and a former co-star of the supernatural drama ""Angel,"" died Tuesday in North Hollywood. He was 32.

The Dublin-born Quinn was found dead from a possible drug overdose at a friend's home, Los Angeles police said Friday. Detectives said the case will remain open pending the completion of toxicology tests, but no foul play was suspected.

Quinn joined the cast of ""Roseanne"" in its third season, playing Becky Connor's not-so-bright, yet sincere boyfriend and then husband, Mark, from 1990 to 1997.

""It was a phenomenal training ground, and I learned things that cannot be taught in any acting class,"" the untrained Quinn told London's Sunday Mirror.

He also co-starred as the half-demon Doyle on ""Angel,"" a spinoff of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" during its 1999 premiere season.

Although most of his roles required him to hide his Irish accent, ""Angel"" was his first role in an American series in which he could speak naturally.

""When you get to speak Irish, you become more at one with yourself, you kind of have a spark when you use it, and I think it's a great dialect,"" he said at the time.

Quinn was born in 1970. He played in local bands before moving to the United States in 1988 with his mother and two sisters.

He made his feature film debut with a supporting role as a drummer in the 1991 John Travolta rock musical ""Shout,"" in which he shared an on-screen kiss with Gwyneth Paltrow. He went on to appear in the films ""Dr. Giggles,"" ""Live Nude Girls"" and ""Campfire Tales.""

He also appeared in the TV movies ""Call Me Anna"" and ""Silhouette"" and co-starred in ""Covington Cross,"" a short-lived, historical-fantasy series, which aired in the United Kingdom and on ABC in 1992. Most recently, he co-starred in ""At Any Cost,"" a 2000 VH1 movie.

He is survived by his mother, Bernadette, and two sisters, Sonya and Louisa."

"event","Tomorrow afternoon I head to Vancouver to see the Headstones at the Commodore...  It's kind of my dream concert.  I looooove seeing the Headstones to begin with, but the Commodore is, like, historic.  And it has a bouncy floor.

It's actually one of the few reasons I can think of to live in Vancouver.  :-)

But, before my flight, I have two finals to write.  One in Ethnobotany and one in Romantic Lit.  *sigh*

So, I'm bouncing around, collecting things for my trip, then reminding myself that I have to study and study and write my finals.  *sigh*

The trip is my graduation present to myself.  I graduate with my Bachelor of Science in Biology in April and I figured I deserved to give myself *something*.  So, Headstones it is :-)

Unfortunately, I can't stay long.  I have another final on Saturday afternoon, so I'm flying home on Friday.  Whirlwind Girl, that's me :-)

I do have one other thing on my itinerary, though: a drive-by photo shoot of Callum's house.  Which isn't too stalkerish, is it?  Okay, it is, but it's not like I'm going to peer in his windows or anything.  Or abduct him off the street.  Probably not, anyway *grin*

I'm now going to go grab some cherry cheesecake ice cream, try to study, then try to sleep..."

"event","I forgot to say, cause, well, there was something shiny, but my sis is living in Vancouver now.

Where Callum also lives.

And she has somehow, through the magic that is my sister, found his phone number.

And called it.

And called me to tell me to phone to see if it really was him on the machine.

So I did.

And it was.

Can I just say right now:

Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!

*koff*

She also lives about 10 minutes away from his house.  She's not a huge fan (she's not really a huge fan of anyone's, other than Charlie Hunnam and I get full blame for that, I lent her my Queer As Folk tapes) but she does appreciate Callum's aesthetic beauty :-)

So, she informs me that she is going to try to get ahold of him (on the *phone*, not like *that*!  Sheesh!) and is going to invite him for coffee.  And not take her husband with her, cause, in her words, ""Callum's foxy!""

Personally, I think that if a person called me out of the blue, knew my name, what I did, where I lived, and asked me to meet with them, I would hang-up and immediately change my number.  So I don't think anything is going to happen, except maybe a restraining order.  Heh.  On the other hand, my sis is an extremely sweet, personable, smart lady and she's a cutie to boot, so who knows?

Either way, when I go down Dec 5th for the Headstones concert, there will be a drive-by picture taking of Callum's residence.  Which is also a little odd, but not near as stalky-scary as what most of my friends are urging me to do.

All this does lead me to the thought: what would my sister do if she lived in the same city as a person she really was a huge fan of?  Also a scary thought :-)"

Your fantasmic universe is rich, even inexhaustible, and it often grazes abysses. Your dreams are dizzy, they pull you to the frontiers of the strangest forbidden, toy with perversity, with death, with the sordid. However, even though the scenarios which your imagination creates are sometimes terrifying and shocking, you know perfectly how to draw a line between dream and reality. It never comes to your mind to experience such chaotic wanderings in actuality. Be reassured: such fantasmagorias have nothing dangerous; they are only an expression of your unconscious - an unconscious which is free and fond of sensations, and which does not mind the conventions within which the majority of your contemporaries remain confined. 


The lover who haunts your nights has a disquieting face. He's a powerful and solitary man. He wears a great black cloak and can brave all dangers - physical as well as metaphysical dangers. He's very often the likeness of a vampire - handsome but terribly dangerous. If you let him approach you, he'll drink your blood and tear your soul away although, in exchange, he'll give you access to immortality. He can also be a brother of doctor Faust, a magician or poet capable of signing a pact with Lucifer, a man hovering far above others since the time he sold his soul to the devil. He's a kind of black archangel who, if you dare come to him, will initiate you to infinite pleasures, of which others have no idea whatsoever!



Oooooh yeah, suck my blood, baby :-)"

One finds in you exactingness and rigor, aristocratic pride and revolt against the flesh. But one can also find in you a fascination for downfall. The beings who crowd your fantasms are eagles who soar far above quagmires, but sometimes also lost creatures coming from the dregs of society. They hover between wisdom and depravation, between power and enslavement. They pull you towards the highest summits or bottomless abysses, they tear you away from the comfortable half-measures which you reject. 


The man who excites your imagination is a great boss or a president, a famous deputy or a scientist of international renown. You're perhaps his secretary, or his faithful admirer. It takes him time to know you, but when he finally sees you, it's love at first sight! For him, you're a woman behind the scenes, the one whom the public doesn't see, but the one without whom he could no longer live. This dream man is also very often a sage. He's an old professor who has explored and understood everything, or a hermit who knows all spiritual ecstasies. If he comes from the dregs of society, the man of your fantasms has something degrading. To love him, to give yourself to him, means to fall very low. But perhaps you'll discover treasures in the bottoms of marshes!


Maybe, maybe not.  I like the scientist of international renown, though.  That could work for me :-)"

Check it out, you're an ABC Warrior!

In bars frequented by colossal death robots, you're always the quiet guy at the back who no-one ever bothers. And for good reason. You've fought in several nuclear wars, could beat the sun in a staring match, and have a chin larger than many articles of furniture. Morals are not a concept you understand, but strangely enough, nobody ever questions your judgement. Usually because they're dead. Even Judge Dredd wets himself when you turn up. Grrrr."

It says this as a description of Alex:

How spiffing! You're Alexander the Great! 

Yeah, baby. You were the King of Macedonia, and conqueror of much of the world; you're responsible for the spread of Christianity, as well as Hellenistic society and even the Roman Empire. Your power was feared for thousands of miles around. 

And how gay were you. When you'd conquered Persia, you fell in love with a male courtier from that court - scandalous in those days, because the Persians were believed to be uncivilised barbarians. 

You were always really in love with your boyhood friend, Hephaestion, and when he died you were grief-stricken to a legendary degree: convinced that he would live on after death, you passed away soon afterwards. 


So, is this why Lex idolizes Alexander the Great?  Cause it's sounding to me like they're a lot alike.  ""...boyhood friend...""

Heh."

Then, transfer to a different bus to get me up the hill.  Passing by a church parking lot that they re-paved last week so it's all smooth.  See one vehicle parked in the lot and one man standing there, along with (I assume) his young son, maybe 2 or 3, who's controlling a sweet looking remote controlled car.

"event","So, let's see, what's been happening lately??

Came back home from Mom and Dad's last week, been getting setteld in.  Had an alright summer, it was kind of boring toward the end, but what else is new?  Got along surprisingly well with Mom and Dad.  I was quite worried that I wouldn't be able to adjust to living with *people* again, but I seem to be remarkably adaptable.  Heh.  Yeah, right :-)

So, back in school.  I've had all my classes now at least once, and I think my favorite is beginning Russian.  I haven't studied a language (unless Greek letters for equations and olde english for poems counts) since high school, which was... God I'm old, high school was 6 years ago now.  So, yeah, beginning Russian.  The prof is absentminded, goes off on tangents about which country Malta *used* to be, 1000 years ago, what happened to Prince Vladomir, etc... all the while, trying to teach us a new alphabet.  Very entertaining :-)  We have an oral component of an hour and a half each week, taught by exchange students, mainly, who are native speakers.  I'm hoping I learn some good Russian swear words :-)

My other courses are fairly boring:

-Intro to Romantic Lit.  Far too many poems for my liking.

-Northern Ecology.  Seems like a tree-hugger type course, so I need to bite my tongue (Cause, well, my dad is a logger, has been for 30 years, and I grew up in logging camps.  But, I'm semi-educated, I can understand everyone's points of view, but hate it when people immediately assume that logging, mining, fishing and any other sort of industry that BC heavily relies upon is automatically bad.)  But, I do like Northern topics, so it'll maybe be alright.

- Populations and Communities.  A 4th-year bio course, heavily math based, but the prof is entertaining, and I understand stats fairly well.

- Ethnobotany.  Indigenous uses of plants.  Should be kind of interesting, but we're just doing boring stuff right now, the structures of plants, etc...  Hopefully will get better.

So, out of all the semesters of university I've done, this one should be the most useful in writing fics (VBG)

I mean, Russian, no brainer, the little stories Nicholas tells us, very useful in Krycek fics.  Ethnobotany, same thing.  Also very useful for Fraser stories :-)  And Northern Ecology applies to them both, to a certain extent.  Woohoo!!

I keep on having Spike and Xander fics spring into my head when I'm trying to get to sleep.  I like it :-)

Settled back into living by myself, still loving it.  It was my birthday 2 days ago.  I'm 23 now!!  Yeah, I know, I'm not old :-)  I was shopping for clothes last week and a sales person asked me if I was doing back to school shopping and, when I said yes, she asked me what grade I was going into!  I very primly told her I was going into my last year of university, then laughed and thanked her :-)

I've seen all the pretty guys I wanted to see again.  Good to see they're all back for another year :-)

Okay, class starting in a bit.  Later!!"

"event","Just got back from a week in Saskatchewan visiting relatives and dropping off a friend at my aunt and uncle's farm.  My friend, H, wanted to do something different for a while, so I asked my aunt and uncle if she could stay with them for a month and work on the farm.

My aunt:  ""Well, I have been working awfully hard lately.""

So, a 24 hour bus ride later and we're in small, small, small town Saskatchewan.  Well, 15 minute drive outside of small, small, small town Saskatchewan.  H is going to help my aunt and uncle harvest their grass seed and do a few other things, then is going to my other aunt and uncle's ranch to help with their buffalo and other things.  Not my idea of a good time, but H is pumped about it.  More power to her :-)

Headed home a few days ago, got into Saskatoon at 7 am, then a 5 hour layover, then headed west, to eventually get home about 30 hours later.  The joys of Greyhound.

One of my cousin's, J, broke his leg playing softball, so we were the ones hanging around in the house and going for the occasional walk.  Actually got to know him, grew familiar with his slightly skewed, definitely dirty (when his mom wasn't around) sense of humour and his brief, crooked grin.  He's tall, slim, blonde and barely 17 and I know that it is very wrong to lust after him.  Especially considering he used to be an open-mouth eater that I just barely knew.  But, oh, that grin.  *sigh*  I'm turning into a dirty old woman.

Got into Saskatoon on my way home, wandered sround the barely awake downtown, read, smoked, normal stuff.  And kept an eye out for a truly lustworthy guy who loads the buses.  Tall, brunette, maybe 25, shorts and blue-grey wool socks.  Longish hair, jazz-man's beard thingy, nice sideburns.  Saskatchewan Transportation shirt buttoned maybe 3 times in the middle, so you can see his tanned, smooth upper chest and tanned, slightly rounded belly above his shorts.  Maybe tanned all over.  Pack of Players Light in his breast pocket, no watch, a MedicAlert bracelet (a nice hint of vulnerability) the only visible jewellery.  Strong but not bulky.

Perfect short-distance eyecandy.  Of course, our relationship was short, not even 5 hours of glimpses and outright stares, but it was very fulfilling for me.  *grin*

Other than that trip, very little excitement going on here.  Trying not to go batty with very little to do.  *sigh*  Poor, poor me :-)  Hanging onto my slashy tendencies with my teeth.  Catching scraps of a fic here and there as my parent's are outside or asleep.  No writing done, *at all*, not even a snippet.  *sigh*

On a happy note, about a month till school starts again!!! Yaa!!!  I'm such a freaking geek."

Had my last game of softball tonight and the coach switched me to shortstop cause one person wasn't there to place first, so there was a lot of switching of players.  And I'm really good at it.  Go figure.  Caught a couple of pop-ups, a couple of low drives and a few grounders.  Had a good time.  Of course, we lost again.  But we had fun and actually played very well.

Heh.  I actually already have a superhero name.  My friends call me Gravity Girl, cause people *cluster* around me.  At university, if I sit down somewhere in the halls or in the caf, about 10 minutes later, somewhere between 3 and 10 friends inevitably show up.  I've even attracted people that weren't supposed to be at the school at all that day.

Yes, I have a job.  Unfortunately, the manager only sees fit to give me a max of 12 hours per week and usually it's only 4.  So not enough to live on.  My parents have been paying my rent for the past 3 months, but it makes economic sense to move in with them.  We lose less money with me *not* working and living with them than with me working and living here.

I need to give up my wonderful, comfortable apartment, find a place for my furniture (I think a couple of friends will take some of it, but the rest will have to be stored), I need to give my notice at work (which I'm just starting to enjoy, as well as becoming good at), and I need to tell all my friends I'm moving for two months.  Joy.

Oh, yeah, and I need to find something to do in Bumfuck BC, other than watching tv and reading.  Not that that's fun, but I am *so* not doing that for 2 fucking months.  I have trouble finding things to do when I'm there for 2 and a half weeks over Christmas.  Last Christmas, I did 3 3-D puzzles and 4 regular puzzles, as well as read a gagillion books.

The one thing to kind of look forward to is that my Mom has said that they could get Internet access for the 2 months I'm there.  Thank fucking God.  *But*: my computer will be in the living room.  Right next to their bedroom.  Does not make for a slasherific 2 months, especially considering they don't *know* about my slashy tendencies.  *sigh*  But maybe I'll actually get my dad to be a little more computer literate.  Joy.

Woe is me *g*

Today is the 8th.  That means I have one final (math) to write and as many fics to write as my muses let me over the span of 21 days.

I've been working on my Skinner/Krycek fic, tentatively called Everything, for about a year now.  Off and on, with quite a few in between.  But last week, I sent it and another to a couple of friends and they sent me suggestions and comments, so maybe I'll actually be able to finish it.

And maybe Mom and Dad will leave the house a lot.  I know they have a concert in July they're going to (I got them the tix) so that'll be a couple of days parent-free.  And I could always go back to that old standby, pen and paper, for my pressing ideas.  But not much fic-reading.  And I've pretty much figured out I'm addicted (vbg) so what am I going to do??

I'm trying to console myself with the oodles of fics I'll have to read when I get back.  It's not working very well.  *sigh*

Whatever.  I was looking forward to a restful summer, a restful start to the year, but now I'll be busy finding a new apartment, getting settled, getting shit figured out when the new school year starts.  Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.

Whatthefuckever.  Enough whining.  Going now to check on supper and grab another Smirnoff.

And, okay, yes, it is an old lady store.  We get more ladies in the store pushing Zellers shopping carts than we get ladies my age (22, for those of you interested :-)

I've never worked retail before and it has it's ups and downs.  Some people are awesome and actually fun to help.  Others are unhappy, annoying, weird people.  I had a lady a few days ago who spent about 15 minutes deciding on 3 pairs of socks (at Northern, the socks are behind the counter, so you need to stand there and hand socks forward to the customer).  So, I stood there and talked with her about socks for 15 minutes.  Interesting.  But she was still nice.  Others, not so nice.

So, I was working this afternoon, 11-3, and we have cds we get from head office that we have to play.  Easy-listening-poppy shit, for the most part, not my kind of tunes.  But they did play Barry White today.  But I digress.  So, they play odd music, but the majority of it reminds me of tunes they play in gay bars.  Well, in the gay bars I've been in, anyways :-)

I was haning and folding and generally boring myself out of my mind, listening to this gay music, when all of a sudden, I recognize a beat.  And, it's ""I've Been Looking For You"" by Daddy's Favorite, aka the song that was played *extensively* on Queer as Folk, the UK version.  Very good song.  And just too funny, considering my thoughts earlier in the day.

I've joined a softball team.  Lots of fun, I know a whole whack of people on the team, so that's cool.  And I haven't played in years, so it's nice to use muscles I haven't had to use for a long time.  One of the few situations when it's pleasant to be sore ;-)

Gotta go, game in a bit."

"event","Had the *oddest* dreams the last few days.  I don't usually have weird dreams that I actually remember.  And not usually disturbing ones, either, just boring dreams that play a lot like a normal day.  But these ones.  *God*.

Couple nights ago:

Hugh Dillon is in town for a concert.  I track him down and get invited to the house he's staying at.  The House of Red Velvet.  The walls and carpet are velvet, the stair's and staircase are red velvet, the fucking ceiling is red velvet.  So, okay, go hang with him for a while.  There's a woman there I assume is his girlfriend, but we aren't introduced, but she is very nice.  We're hanging around and he's *mean*.  Not caustic, sarcastic or indifferent, just mean.  He was a ""right bastard, yeah?"" as my Grandpa used to say.

It was snowing outside and we eventually left for the concert and I woke up just before the tunes started, but the whole thing just made me feel icky.  Cause I've met Hugh Dillon.  Granted, it was only for a few minutes, but he's almost always nice to fans.  And if he's not nice to you, he ignores you.  He is *not* like he was in my dream.

So, what the hell does this mean?  I don't like red velvet??  Cause I could have told you that before.  Grrrrrr....

*sigh*  Why, oh why can't I dream about Callum??  BastardCallum would be just fine for me :-)

Last night\this morning:

Living in my town, except instead of being in a river valley, it was on a cliff by the ocean.  It's dark and there're flood warnings and evacuation notices.  So we hustle around, and my sister is here and she's acting *really* dumb.  Worried about a specific pair of socks, if memory serves, and wondering off at odd times.  My friends from town were there.  And E's boyfriend, D, was running around, trying to make sure if his family was doing okay (which they were) and if our group was doing okay (which we were, whenever we could find my sister).  And D was off checking on his family when we finally decided to leave for shelter.  So he missed us.

I was standing outside the shelter, having a smoke when D finally showed up.  He rushed inside to find E, but couldn't.

This one is not so hard to understand.  D *is* having issues between his family and E.  Well, mainly with his Mom and E.  But right now, I think everyone's handling it pretty good.  His Mom seems to be kind of over-reacting, but I *can* see where she's coming from and her complaints have been valid.

We'll see.

Crossing my fingers for Callum or Nick Lea tonight.  Or Peter Wingfield or Michael Rosenbaum :-)"

"event","Going through school papers from the last couple of semesters and came across this from an oral presentation I did on November 15, 2001.  The prof spelled my last name wrong, but whatever :-)  The presentation was on the Andromeda galaxy.  Heh.  To an English class.

""Jennifer:

I was very impressed with your presentation, particularily your wonderful voice quality and your clear and methodical coverage of your topic.  You presented what could have been complex scientific information in a way that was very accessible to your audience, and your use of all presentation methods available to you, including the blackboard and the overhead, ensured a lively and comprehensive presentation.  Your choice to end the presentation with practical information on how the class could partake in your topic was particularily effective and I noted a great interest in the possibility.

Your visual aids were all clear and your presentation's structure was clear and eminently followable.  I look forward to reading your final paper.

A+""

I didn't even know followable was a real word before this.  I gave the presentation the thursday before the Leonid meteor shower, so I told the class all about that.

Oh, the joys of dazzling Arts majors with science (big grin)."

"event","My brother-in-law took me to see Attack of the Clones tonight.  Paid for my popcorn and everything :-)

First off:

Yoda kicks royal ass.  Whirling dervishes have nothing on him.  And Forcing his cane back into his hand and walking with it like he needs it afterwards, oh, laughed my ass off.

""You must stop those Federation starships!""  Did anyone else find this fucking hilarious??  I mean, come on, that must be a shout-out to Star Trek.  Federation starships, indeed.  Could you imagine Star Trek in the Star Wars universe??  Uh oh, mind boggling :-)

Hayden was alright.  Nothing Oscar-worthy, but okay.  A little odd sometimes, but *everything* was occasionally odd.  Such as Amidala's outfits.  So, right, Hayden.  I wonder if he really is 8 and a half feet tall, cause those cloaks sure make it look like it.  One thing I didn't like was his character was never fully fleshed out.  We know the reason why he's angry at Obi Wan, but we don't *see* it.  Other than Ani blowing up at Obi over a few things that weren't really worth blowing up over.  And, yeah, he's pretty, but not my cup of tea (mmmmmmCallum).

And, I'm sorry, but if some kid that I last saw 10 fucking years ago was looking at me like that, I would be fucking uncomfortable too.  He was just, well, *creepy* for a while.  Ugh.  Stalker much?

Back to the tension between Anakin and Obi Wan.  Was it there maybe because [slash alert] Obi Wan had feelings for his beautiful young Padawan that weren't reciprocated?  I don't really think so.  Cause it's mostly on Anakin's side that we see all the bad feelings.  Obi Wan *knows* his Padawan is a force to be reckoned with (snicker) but he also knows that he still needs to develop control.  He has genuine affection for Anakin, but he still knows his weaknesses.  Clouded his mind is not.  Hence, no overwhelming, passionate, heartwrenching love/lust.

I must say, Obi Wan (aka: Ewan McGregor) was *fantastic*.  Devilish, dangerous and quite dapper too.  (Look out, it's Alliteration Girl!!)  Loved the mischevous glint he had in his eyes for most of the movie.  This is a man who loves living his life.  Don't know if that's simply Ewan or if that was his intent for Obi Wan, it is what it is.

The love scenes dragged.  And the first few were kind of creepy. Mostly I just snarked to myself about Amidala's outfits.  Umm, Dominatrix Amidala??  WTF??

Wrapping up now :-)  Some fight scenes confusing, FX were, as always, amazing, one-liners were funny, very little Jar Jar, but, enough to remind me he makes my teeth grate.  The Boba Fett intro was cool, except the kid was a little annoying.  The new species were cool.  The guy who used to be on NYPD Blue, ummm, Jimmy somebody, was hella-distracting.  And I'm pretty sure he's a bad guy.  But it could just be the facial hair.

The Matrix teaser looks awesome.  Keanu is pretty as always.

And that, followed by Yoda doing a Keanu move??  Fucking hilarious.

Night all!"

What the fuck??

It's May 5th.  I know it is, I just checked my computer.  And yet, it's -2.4.

So, I'm sitting here huddling over my cup of tea, because, yes, I turned up the heat, but not up to the pre-spring heat it used to be.  So it's kind of cold in my apartment.

Talked to my Mom and she told me to put on a sweater.  Like there was any doubt.

When I got up, I turned on my tv to warm it up.  And when the picture cleared up (takes about 30 minutes), there it was.  Hour of Power.  That's just great.  I think I would rather use looking at Callum or someone like that than watching people talk about Jesus to warm me up (no offense, God).

(sigh)

Still cold.

No snow yet, but we're supposed to get about 20 cm today (about 8 inches).  Ugh.

Coolness is nice, coldness is not and snow is not.

"event","I went to see Spider-man tonight.

Remind me never to do that again.

It was alright, but I would never have spent $10 on it if I knew it was, well, a stupid ""love story"".  Willem Dafoe was pretty cool, Kirsten Dunst was annoying, Tobey Maguire was okay but nothing special.  Some parts were funny, but not enough of the movie was funny to recommend it for that.  The effects were cool, but again, nothing special.  Seen it *all* before.

The main thoughts running through my head:

""If Smallville had the budget, *that's* what super-speed would look like.""

""'Oscorp'.  Is that like Luthorcorp.?""

""I wonder if Harry knows Lex?""

""This movie would be *sooooo* much better if Lex were in it.""

<sigh>

Okay, TooMuchInformation time:

I went with my best friend's boyfriend, his good friend and one of his best friend's girlfriends.  The best friend's girlfriend, R, is one of those people who spends $85 a month on her hair and ends up not having enough to eat the last week of the month.  But I digress.

So, I was sitting next to R and something smelled very familiar.  We were still waiting for the previews to start, so we were all chatting and she started to tell me about this new line of make-up and stuff she started using.  Okay, whatever.  But she tells me about this new lip liner that she's been using that's all chubby like a crayon (how could you *line* your lips with something like that?) and it also smells!!  Cool (she said drily).  So, what flavour are you wearing now, R?  Caramel!!  Cool (also drily).

Sitting there and I put down my popcorn and am still waiting for the previews and smell this smell again.  And I figure out it's R's lip stuff.  But it still smells *really* familiar.  Think about it for a bit and start to giggle hysterically.

Because R's lip stuff smells exactly like the first lubricant I ever tried.  Root Beer Float.  Yummy.

So I sit through more than 2 and a half hours of previews and movie, smelling this smell that brings me right back to my last year of high school and my then boyfriend.  Remembering the backseat of his car, his bed when his parents were gone, my bed when my parents were asleep.

A *very* weird situation.

And the thoughts about Lex didn't help much, either."

"event","I've been growing out my hair for a few months now.  It was short before, really short, probably about 1 and a half inches long at the longest.  Now, it's a good 4 inches long and, seeing as how it's starting to get hot again, getting in my way.  So, I've taken to pinning it back when I'm at home, simply to get it the *fuck* off my face.

Heh.  

When you haven't been able to see your hair without a mirror for 7 years, having it in your face is kind of frustrating.

So, pinned it back while I was working, then went to the bathroom and checked to see if it was straight or not.  And, I saw something I had *never* seen before.  A beautiful man or woman sprawled, naked and glistening, in my bathtub?  No, nothing as ... entertaining as that :-)

I saw my very first white hair.

Heh.  I feel almost like an adult now :-)

Now, I'm a natural blonde.  When I was a kid, my hair was so blonde it *was* white.  It's darker now, with a tendency to turn dark blonde in the winter.  But it bleaches fast in the summer.  But it's *not* white anymore.

And I'm 22.  I guess this is old enough to get a white hair.

Heh.  Again with the almost adultnes.

This is very odd.  I'm not bothered by it at all actually, (unlike my 24 year old sister who found a wrinkle a few months ago ;-) I just never expected to find a white hair.  I was always under the impression blondes go silver, not white or grey.  Odd, odd, odd.

But fun :-)"

"event","Smallville on Wed:

Mmmmmmm... Conniving!Lex is a good thing.  How could he actually be a fully functioning member of society with a father like that?  Granted, Lex has problems, issues and major hang-ups, but he's okay.  Not sociopathic, psychopathic, etc...  I'm thinking he must have had a nanny, or the boarding schools really helped with making him into an actual person.  Odd.

Andromeda last night:

Um.  Yeah.  Okay.  *Lots* of good Harper (I'm already missing the boots) and some good tension between Tyr and Beka.  But, God, Dylan!  What The Fuck??  Show started with a Dylan crotch shot (nice, granted, but not the first thing anybody wants to see) and the rest of the ep was like that.  Dylan will figure it out, Dylan's mission is more important than our lives, Dylan will survive anything (and this from Tyr!!  It was a fucking funny line, but still!  I mean, come on, Tyr??), etc, etc...  Ad nauseum.

Blecch.

Okay, so good things:

Tyr's funny lines.  Paraphrasing:  ""When the universe collapses, three things will survive.  Tyr Anasazi, cockroaches and Dylan Hunt.  With Dylan trying to save the cockroaches.""

Couple that with a very, very nice Tyr-smile, and it's golden.

Dylan, speaking to Trance, and Harper, speaking to Rommie, yet saying the same things, cutting back and forth between them.  Nice.  Good argument for slashiness right there <g>

Harper barrelling around the innards of the ships, climbing, prying, melting, heh, it was all good.

Bad:

Tyr's vest, before he opened it.  Uuuugly.  But, it's Tyr, so he opened it to display his man-boobs.  Then got into a boob-match with Beka.  Not of the good.

Trance's outfit.  *Again*.  Is it just me, or is it starting to *look* like it should be giving off major BO?

Dylan.  See above.

The last, oh, 20 minutes or so.  Dragged and dragged and didn't make too much sense and Dylan was annoying and who exactly dropped the slipstream drive: Dylan or Andromeda??  Grrrr.

Dylan at the end.  *Not* immediately asking where Harper was.  Bad Non-Slashy!Dylan.

The dancing.  Again:  the dancing.  Although Harper looked cute.

Why did the creature only return every however many years?  Is it like a grocery run?  Are there other planets it eats, too??  Why, in the last shot we saw of the ship, Andromeda was still shiny, smooth, *NOT* digested at all??  They could have done something!!

B- for ""Belly of the Beast"", just because of Harper.  And Tyr smiling.

Mutant X:

Watched both Andromeda and Mutant X with a friend, D, who, while a sci-fi fan, doesn't watch either.  He agrees that Andromeda is fairly entertaining, appreciates Trance and Rommie's boobs, but doesn't see the Harper-yumminess.  Whatever.

So, Callum.  mmmmCallum.  He's actually starting to look his age, which is kind of interesting.  Cause he still does it for me.  Heh.  I wrote 'it'.  Heh.

Callum played Zack Lochkart, Shalimar's ex.  Had a ... rather useless mutant ability.  Can project what's behind walls etc. so others can see it.  And they use him as a safe-cracker guy.  Odd.  They didn't really *need* him for anything.

He had some nice chemistry with Shalimar, except I'm starting to think Victoria Pratt may be a man.  Interesting.  <grin>  I saw Callum's tongue!!  I saw Callum's tongue!!!  *koff*

Nice clothes throughout, black and more black.  Good hair, and my God! are his eyes getting bluer??  <sigh>

The rest of the ep was pretty much throwaway for me.  I'm not a fan of Mutant X to begin with, and I'm afraid that this ep is not going to make me one.  In the second half, while Brennan and Adam were talking about Zack (""He's bad, he's making Shalimar uncomfortable"", etc..) D and I were making up lines for them:

Me (as Brennan): ""I know you don't like him.  Why?""

D (as Adam): ""He is so much hotter than me, I don't think I can take it.""

M: ""I have to agree, he is much hotter than any of us.""

D: ""I might be forced to jump him the next time I see him.""

M: ""Would I be able to get a piece of that action?""

This was actually more entertaining than the real dialogue <vbg>  And D shows a fine appreciation for Callum <grin>

Actual amusing part of the ep:  Shalimar and, I want to say, Emma, at the very end, saying that Zack must have been amazing in bed.  Shalimar agrees and Emma reads her and agrees with her as well.  Yes, indeed.

Oh, flutter portion:  Callum's shoulder blades under his very sleek looking black shirt, as he's draped over Shalimar on the couch.  Oh, and I saw Callum's tongue!!!  *koff*

***

D and I decided that last night was the night of strange boobs.  Andromeda was on right before Mutant X and we discussed the make-up on Trance's boobs.  Poor Laura Betram (did I spell that right?).  Does she do the make-up herself or does she get two or three make-up people painting on her boobs every morning??

And Emma, in Mutant X.  She looked... odd.  Kind of like her boobs were down to her belly button.

Of course, this led to a discussion about asymmetries in various body parts.  Heh.

So, that's my, well, it's long, we'll say, my $0.05 Canadian.

Later"

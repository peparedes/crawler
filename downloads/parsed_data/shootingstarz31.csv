We can chill out with the TV. The empty corona hugs the table. Stale smoke smells fill my room, I'm going to bore myself to death. And before it's all said and done, we will go down in history. And you, you're a star above stars, you never hold back. Do you believe in miracles cause I'm sitting next to one right now. You're bringing the old smiles back and Im going to bore myself to death. Before it's all said and done, we will go down in history. And you, you're a star above stars you never hold back. Is life with me as swell as you had hoped? I'll take the fall, and take the bullets for us both. And you, you're a star above stars.

i went out with Lora tonight. we picked up kyle and nick. kyle and nick were mean as shit to me all night long. i drove them around for 50 miles, collectively. neither one had the decency to thank me for the ride. that makes me mad. i felt like a total asshole because i was in a shitty mood and i'm afraid it upset Lora. we went to see the ring. i hate scary movies. this one is absolutely no exception. i sat with my head down and ears plugged for most of it, and for the last 20 minutes, i was crouched in the floor, ears plugged singing to myself. i won't be able to sleep tonight. none of these sentences are very complex. sorry.

on the way home all i could think about was shaun... and how i wanted him next to me so i could lean over and kiss his hand, or lay my head on his shoulder. *sigh* i wanted to talk to him really badly, too. i'm trying to convince my mom to change my calling plan on my cell phone. i don't know how well i'm doing. pray for me guys. shaun's my world.

Welcome to Canada, it's the Maple Leaf State. 
Canada, oh Canada it's great! 
The people are nice and they speak French too. 
If you don't like it, man, you sniff glue. 
The Great White North, their kilts are plaid, 
Hosers take off, it's not half bad. 
I want to be where yaks can run free, 
Where Royal Mounties can arrest me. 
Let's go to Canada, let's leave today, 
Canada, oh, Canada, I Sil Vous Plait. 
They've got trees, and mooses, and sled dogs, 
Lots of lumber, and lumberjacks, and logs! 
We all think it's kind of a drag, 
That you have to go there to get milk in a bag. 
They say ""eh?"" instead of ""what?"" or ""duh?"" 
That's the mighty power of Canada. 
I want to be where lemmings run into the sea, 
Where the marmosets can attack me. 
Let's go to Canada, let's leave today, 
Canada, oh, Canada, I Sil Vous Plait. 
Please, please, explain to me, 
How this all has come to be, 
We forgot to mention something here. 
Did we say that William Shatner is a native citizen? 
And Slurpees made from venison, 
That's deer. 
Let's go to Canada, let's leave today, 
Canada, oh, Canada, I Sil Vous Plait.

today feels like my shoes are untied
cause i keep falling down
just don't feel like myself today
cause you've been gone
but only for a couple of days
but it feels like weeks in my mind
someday in the very near future
come walk with me we'll get scraped knees

and these 4am's are too hard
too many thoughts running through my head

yesterday, when i started to feel sick during 7th period, i decided that i had to stay for pit rehearsal or mr seipp would be mad. yeah... huge mistake. i could barely drive home and by the time i got in my driveway i could hardly move. i went upstairs and layed in the fetal position for 3 hours. mom got home and i worked up enough energy to go downstairs and tell her something was wrong and i felt like i was dying. anyway, i was in excruciating pain til 4:45 this morning before i finally passed out from exhaustion. i hate it when you throw up and only feel better for 5 minutes. anyway, last night i only wanted my mom and shaun. 

i haven't <i>really</i> talked to shaun in close to 3 days. it's driving my absolutely insane. can you go through people withdrawl? i think so. i started to make shaun's cd today. i'm just going to send it to him today or tomorrow. i'm so crazy about him...and i love him so much it scares me. i've never felt like this over anyone else. *empty frames cover up my walls, but they can't hide how much i miss you* 

anyway, i'm feeling better, but i'm going crazy because i miss shaun. i'm gonna go mail this cd and his stuffed goat. 

<marquee>there's no place i'd rather be than in your arms tonight</marquee>"

hello gone awry
don't cry the fight ain't over
unless you let it pass you by

i'm looking for a song to sing, yeah
i'm looking for a friend to borrow
i'm looking for my radio so i might find a heart to follow

i've never been just wearing down to nothing
i've never been just looking for a reason so that maybe you'd be thinkin of me... you'd be thinking of me

all that i have found in reason
is reason just to not believe

these blue yonder dreams and second hand shoes
you're so far gone that you're left to lose

you're the tar in that old cigar
and the worn out cable on the cable car
and you're too tired to admit you've got to choose

"event","Lying there next to you I had no control. No control of my thoughts, my feelings, my laughter that you caught me in. I pulled you closer and you smiled at me and asked me what I was so happy about. I didn't tell you, but I wanted to tell you. You are what makes me happy. The happiest I've felt in so long. So, so long. Instead I avoided the question, saying I didn't know what it was I just felt happy. I just felt really good being there. With you. Lying next to you. Hearing you breathe and watching your mouth move, talk about random football players I didn't know of and rest on your chest as it sank up and down. I heard I was cute because of this, which made my insides twirl even more. I feel like a little girl on her birthday, with balloons and presents and ice cream cake and so much ahead of her. Like I have so much to look forward to in such a little amount of time and I'm overwhelmed with happiness. I'm overwhelmed with you and I can't get enough of it. Keep em coming baby, because I can't get enough of you."

I've been thinking lately. Which I know is bad for me. Sometimes I think I want things that I don't need. Like a boyfriend for instance. I catch myself misssing steve, but really I know I only miss the void of what steve and I had. I'vebeen looking for someone to replace that void and I thought I found someone. But he is never there when I need him, only when he needs me.

I can't say I don't play along with him though, I obviously lead him on to thinking that I want what he does. The truth is I want so much more than only physicality.




Tonight is the last night of summer! I'm sad its over but at the same time I'm grateful for it, and excited for new beginnings. Can you believe that this time next year I'll be going to college? I don't want to grow up now that its actually happening. I want to stay young and have my mom go grocery shopping for me and do my laundry and be the only one who knows how much peanut butter to put on my sandwiches. I dont want to wake up to an empty house just to work all day then come home to a big bed for only me. 


Live the dream, because you have to wake up sometime."

which makes me really sad.
I went to the driving meeting last night at school and it just reminded me of lunch which reminds me I have to wake up early next week to go back. and its my last year in high school. THE LAST ONE. I can't believe that I've waited so long to grow up and now that its finally happening I don't want to anymore. Its a strange feeling, getting older and beginning to realize that I wont be seeing the same people I have seen the past 3 years anymore. The friends I know could turn into people I don't. I'm feeling sentimental. I am going to enjoy this year regardless, its only the beginning."

today is my mom's birthday, and I got home from ocean city today. kristen michelle kelley and i stayed at her aunts place in fenwick which is literally 5 minutes from ocean city. it was cool because we had no parents or supervision or anything. it kind of felt like they were my roommates, and made me think about college and frightened me even more. its funny, because when I was young I always wanted to be old. and now that I'm growing up I wish I could still play with my barbies or not worry about how I look in a bikini and just build sandcastles.

overall, ocean city was amazing. the beach was beautiful, and we stopped by bethany for a night. ha it seemed like a private school there, everyone knew each other and popped their collars. we met a lot of drunk people and funny guys on the bus. ate tons of subway and stalked surfers. right on!

"event","i'm so sick of hearing about things that i wish would just be dropped..and i wish people would just move on and accept the way things are now. whats done is done and if i dont want to go back to how things used to be, then thats my choice. ""I miss you"" and ""things arent the same"". seriously, shut the fuck up. its your own fault things are this way so suck it up and get used to it.. you should be by now. why am i going to waste so much time and effort into something when i know its just going to be screwed up in the end? i can learn to be happy without you. i have learned it. its not difficult when youre such a different person than how you used to be and i'm sick of hearing the same meaningless attempts to get me back over and over. the only thing you want out of me is knowing you can have me...and i'm not giving you that advantage again.


take your bullshit and feed it to some other gullible girl, because i'm not one of them anymore."

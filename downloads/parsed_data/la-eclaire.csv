(Bet you couldn't guess.)

Ahhh, and I got a comment from my lovely friend.
Isn't that sweet?
Awwww.

Ok, I guess I should take the hint and go comment on his now... it's just that his blog is like soooo last month... he hasn't updated in like ages. Hojesus. I'm like talking like him now.

So anywhoooo, I suppose I should update more often... but I have little enough time as it is. Maybe I should do the whole weekly-update thing. 

Ahhhh, my violin tutor decided it was time to change the bridge on my violin... Ok, so the violin itself sounds louder...
But in my opinion, it sounds SCRATCHY and METALLLIC and so INSENSITIVELY LOUD. 

I liked my chunky bridge... 

Oh well... the tutor knows best, I guess. Maybe I'll adjust it a little and not tell her...
hmmnnnnn...

"event","Haaaa, I have the feeling that lots has happened and yet I can't remember much.

Except that I finished Alice Through the Looking-glass today, which I am glad of. As far as I can recall, the first story was better, (Where she falls down the rabbit-hole) and I had a really wierd day-dream about J-rockers replacing the characters. (You know, Mana as Alice, Gackt as the white rabbit, Yoshiki as the Red Queen, etc.) Only I think it may already have been done by someone. No doubt it has. Ah well. I'm not really a fanfiction person anyway.  
Ok, so if there's something with a REALLY thrilling summary I'll read, but otherwise I prefer original stories... especially Alice in Wonderland! ^_^

My Hello Kitty skirt production seems to have come to a standstill. Day-um! Mum is always too tired when she gets hoem from work, and I know I'll do something wrong if I try it myself. Like break the machine.
But, I'm happy with my scarf and mittens and EARMUFFS! Ohohohoh, they are just SMEXY.

Ok, if I were to do the whole Alice in Wonderland thing with J-rockers, I'd have the characters as follows.

Alice: Mana (Malice Mizer) (A silent Alice. Wouldn't that be nice!)
White Rabbit: Gackt (Gackt with bunny ears. Well, why not?)
Mad Hatter: hide (X Japan) (Need I explain?)
March Hare: Kana (I think she would look cute with Bunny ears and a bow-tie!)
Red Queen: Yoshiki (X Japan) ('nuff said.)
Red King: Toshiya (X Japan) (I don't know, I just think he'd suit the part.)
Cheshire Cat: Miyavi (He has the cheekiest grin. He's perfect!)

And I can't be bothered to think of any more... but I think they would suit their parts rather well... yet, I don't think they would agree with me...

Oggg, I guess it's time to go and do something. Well, goodbye, my friends. (Who even actually reads this? Apart from Leon, Richard and Maybe Lucy. Not that they ever comment. Nobody ever does. *sigh*)
By the way, guys, that was a hint."

"event","Well, I learned a lesson yeaterday. 
A very valuble one.

Never EVER send me out in a car on my own.
That is, when I actually get my licence. ^_^; 14 is such a stupid age... oh, to age two years...

Anyway, yesterday morning Mum couldn't give me a lift to music classes because the car was being fixed. (Something to do with the wheel bearings, I don't know what.) So I had to walk down to Girl's High. Supposedly the same distance to there as it is to my own school, James Hargest College.
And Mum, being the kindly soul that she is, even showed me the map the night before so I knew which street to go down! 
So off I went, down the street, until I got to the road witht he antique shop on it. So I was like ""Ah, this is the shop we pass when we come back from music!"" So I turned right and found myself on TAY STREET. (This is where the embarrassment starts)
So I walked along and suddenly realised I'd walked round in a circle, because my street was just on the left.
By this time I should have been there but I was very confused so I just went back home to check the map again. (Mum was still asleep. I mean, sheesh. Where's the sympathy? I'm running around the streets of Invercargill and she's snoozing?! I better be kidding. -_-;)
I found that the main road running through Tay Street came out right next to Girl's High, so I went back down Tay Street to find it... only I went in the wrong direction. PERFECTLY in the wrong directon. I could not have been more wrong as to which way I was facing... so I went left instead of right and ended up walking down Stuart street, a road I'd never heard of, backtracking to my Violin tutor's house (Don't ask me how I ended up there) and finally ended up on the road I was SUPPOSED to be on... after about an hour and a half. Then it took me ANOTHER half-hour to get to the school, so in the end I completely missed my violin lesson and arrived half an hour before irchestra finished. I also gave myself a mental kick when I crossed the road I was originally on before I made the wrong turn by the antique shop. *groan*

It was much quicker walking back home, anyway. I had to phone mum after orchestra to assure her that I was only ten minutes late (yeah, ten minutes late for the END OF MY VIOLIN LESSON! >___<)and yes, I found my way ok. (After walking in the exact opposite direction to the school.)

So, that was my little adventure for the week. I hope I won't be having another one for a VERY long time. 
(Oh, and if I hadn't turned off at the antique shop, I would have been five minutes early for my lesson. How humiliating.) 

But things got much happier as the day went on, as I went to buy some patterns and fabric and other goodies. Now my Hello Kitty fleec-ey skirt is almost finished, and I have a scarf and mittens to match (Oh, they're just ADORABLE! ^________^) and I'm playing music as loud as I can without disturbing the whole neighbourhood. Because someone in the house has to."

It must be the headbanging.

Well, it's Thursday! Which basically means I haven't updated for ages because I'm a lazy girl. ^_^;;;

So now I'm relaxing, listening to music, and randomly creating a list of favorite songs by certain artists. It's funny how fun boring things get when you're bored. 

What makes me very upset though, is that there is nothing worth writing about.

Is this true reality?

If so, it's depressing.

In which case I suppose I should get off my butt and do some homework.

"event","So, it was mufti day today... 
It's not really that exciting... I didn't even get to wear my Strawberry skirt because it was so cold... this morning, at least. Instead, I opted for my Linkin Park top over a baggy t-shirt and a long-sleeved top... much more sensible, except the shoes, which pinched my feet from when I arrived at school, all the way through to when I got back home ten minutes ago.
And now I have a blood blister the size of mount everest on my big toe...
Ok, so it's the size of a 5 cent coin.
Close enough!

But what really upset me today was that I found myself doing a favor that I wouldn't usually do for anyone... FOR JACKSON. 
I mean, what the heck? Since when do I fetch objects from my schoolbag when I'm already in the library? Usually I tell whoever it is to go get the object from my bag themselves. (It's the one with the ""I'm adorable"" badge in it. Nobody else has that. ^____^;) But no, this morning, Jackson was like (to Marty. e_e) ""Hey, do you have your timetable?"" and Marty was like ""sorry man..."" which was rubbish because Marty always has his timetable. He's too to turn up late for a class. (Which would mean he would be on his own, which he NEVER is.) So Jackson continues asking people if they have thier timetable, until he gets to me.
The ""Nope, it's in my bag, but you can get it if you want"" was poised on my lips, but instead I was like ""Yaaah, hold on."" 
And halfway back through the library doors it suddenly occured to me what a fool I am. 
So I handed it over... the guy didn't even LOOK at me. I mean jeez, I said I was a fool. I'm now a rejected fool.
Argh, I HATE HIM... so... much... @_@
I hope this never finds its way back to Tracy. She'll never let me hear the end of it. Oh, but she taught me the word for ""Today"" today. Jaaa. I rock.

So anyway, Mrs. Larby took our geography class on a mini-field trip down to the river... which was cool because the sun was out, and black warms up quickly... and so I was toasty. Unlike this morning when my teeth chattered in the library... not cool...

And THEN this morning in REC period Sharleen, Kimberly and I played badminton! What this means is ""Let's gang up on short stuff to make her run!"" 
Short stuff being me.
But that's ok because we ganged up on Kimberly, then on Sharleen. So we all had to run a bit. : P

AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHH well my toe needs nursing so goooodddbbyyyyeeee!

"event","Erica and Sharleen popped round to my house to take me off to Queen's Park.
I was kind of not properly dressed and with a pile of homework that literally resembled the Leaning Tower of Piza (because my electric fan was like right behind it...) 
So we went to the kid's playground, where a new skate-boardy thing on a frame has just been installed. Erica and I had a go, then some guy came up and had a go and he was like WHOAH! He must have been a skater or something because he was sending the board right up the the edge and... He almost accidenatlly kicked me in the face coz' I got too close, but that's cool.
Then we went to see the duckpond, and Sharleen threatened to throw me in. NOT COOL. And THEN we went to see the aviary with all the wierd and wonderful birds. I hate that place. Imagine living in a cage. They're huge cages with proper ecosystem... but they're still cages. But I did see Mr. Millerick, my old year 10 science teacher. The one with ten children. Yeaaaah. 

He was PREACHING.

Yes, that's right.

And he had an EASEL... and he was painting words on it like ""Blood"" and ""guilt"" and ""Jesus""... and I got a bit scared because, well, Mr. Millerick is a SCIENCE teacher... he doesn't EVER talk about Jesus... It was like he was a whole different person...
Well, at least he left his offspring at home today. Seriously, those kids are LOUD. You see 'em in the street, chances are you heard them ten minutes before.

In other news, Mom made the BEST seafood rice meal last night... It was SOOOOOOO GOOD. It had prawns (which I had to peel, which was really gross because their legs were still attached, but they tasted GREAT! - The prawns that is, not the legs....) and squid (Not like the yucky reconstituted stuff you have in squid rings either, this was REAL squid.) and Mussels (Ok, si I don't like Mussels, but they tasted ok.) And SCALLOPS! OOOOOMMGGGGZZZZ we NEVER get to have Scallops! They taste soooo good fried! And they were in our dinner! And Mom didn't even TELL ME! I was like ""Hey, these mussels taste like cheese..."" And then I realised they were scallops! I almost DIED. 
Oh, but mom had to get up halfway through our meal to fetch the olives, which she forgot to put in. e_e Olives are my FAVORITE! I love them to bits and she FORGOT. Ach, I guess she was preoccupied with remembering the scallops.
 
Well, anyway, my pen-friend Mami sent me another picture of a Japanese place... I love my new friends. ^o^ They're so cool!

Well, now I am off to eat kumara chips and drink vegetable stock. (No really, put a level teaspoon of veggie stock powder in a cup, add boiling water, and you get like a soup! Only it's really thin. It's soooooo good, especially coz' it's so freezing here right now. And kumara chips taste kind of sweet. O_o;)

Ohh, except now I have another pen-friend. He's a nice guy.

Ick, Estelle gave us a theory test today during violin class. Not my fave way to spend a Saturday morning, but it was really easy. Incidentally, Helen's pencil had HELLO KITTY on it! I love Hello Kitty. I'm making myself some Hello Kitty fleecy leg-warmers! Excitement. And a skirt to match, except my thighs are just disgusting at the moment. Time to whip out the excersise mat. Or not. 
(Haha, the EXCORSISE mat. Hahahahaha... well... it's actually not really that funny... V_V)
Aaaaaanywho, what was I saying? Oh yeah, and then during orchestra we spent like fifteen minutes TUNING THE DAMN SECOND VIOLINISTS! Normally I would be fine with this, but they had just arrived from freaking Junior String Ensemble! Where they would have spent fifteen minutes getting tuned up ANYWAY! 
See, my violin was slightly out becuase the piano was probably slightly out of tune. But when the kids had been tuned to an ELECTRIC TUNER and all they had to do was walk down the hall to orchestra... I can accept that the temperature changes but these kids were SERIOUSLY OUT OF TUNE. As in, someone needs to hold up the kid's bridge while he RE-ATTACHES HIS STRING. 
I mean, what have they been doing to their violins? Sword-fighting?!?!

Bah, I'm sorry. It just REALLY REALLY... fustrates me. ^_^;;;

Well, now I must go and do some overdue homework and revision for my internal assessment on genetics on monday! ^____^ buh-bye!

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW I'm in a good mood.
And I love Malice Mizer. 

Well, yesterday I sent messages to about six different people on that pen-pal site Tasty (I will never get over the awesomeness of that name...) gave me. I already got two replies, both from girls my age. They seem like pretty nice people so far. I'm glad I have new friends! ^_^

I was wondering if maybe six was too many people to message at once, so I asked Tasty how many penfriends he started with. 
""Oh, eight."" 
Eight? EIGHT?!?! Jesus, and I thought ~I~ was an attention whore!

Well, that's ok then, if he has eight, six is a good number.

Ohhhh, but Mrs. S (my Art teacher) gave me the photo that she took of me for the self-portrait project in art today! It's FUGLY! It's REALLY REALLY bad and she actually HELD IT UP in front of the WHOLE CLASS. Couldn't she have used one of the pretty girls to use as an example? e_e
I swear, she only pretends to be nice to me.

   
Anyway, Tracy taught me more Kantonese, including the phrase ""what ya doin'?"" 
(or at least, the chinese equivelent) and 'up', 'down', 'drawing' (because if she asks me ""what you doin'?"" chances are I'm drawing!) and 'point', as in the decimal place. Because we were doing Math at the time. ^_____^;;;
She also started to teach me how to write some of the words properly. I found this hilarous, since it was in the back of my Math book. So did Mr McEwan... but he's a really nice teacher anyway.

So then at lunch time, Tracy decided it was time to put all my newly-found skills into practice. Of course, this meant grabbing ~Jackson~ by the shoulder of his school blazer and dragging him towards my table. 
""Go on then! Say something!""

Did I mention that Tracy hasn't taught me how to say 'hi', 'I don't speak chinese very well' or 'what can I say'? No... didn't think so. So as I stuttered and blushed (oh the shame of it all.) my way through half a sentence (in english too! jeez!) she interrupted me.

""Count to TEN!"" Oh, great. Just like during Math where you STILL have to correct me sometimes? And this is in front of my old/current annoying schoolgirl crush? (haha that sounds REALLY bad, but I have to use 'crush' for lack of a better word.) I'm really not ready for this kind of STRESS! 

""Oh, you can?"" Jackson sounded like he was actually interested. Maybe he's REALLY good at pretending to like people. e_e And so I started to recite those ten words that Tracy had drummed into me. Actually, I'm pretty proud of myself! Tracy only had to help me on ""eight"" and ""ten"", and I must have pronounced ""nine"" right because they didn't laugh at me! 
And when I finished, Jackson said ""Well done! That's really good!"" and I felt like a little kid that had just won a chocolate car. 
That's a GOOD feeling, by the way!

Oh, and Tracy also got me to go over to Jackson's table so she could show off at what a good teacher she was by making me say all the words she taught me. 
Like ""sky"" and ""me"". When I said ""me"", Jackson said ""Do you know 'you'?"" Which I'm glad of because I did! ^_^ So I decided to make Tracy feel special and say ""well, Tracy's a good teacher."" to which he replied ""no she's not!"" 
Rivals to the end.
So then I had to say ""see ya!"" and return to my friends. (oh, when I went over there they all crowded round to watch me speak (I mean, how fascinating...) and Tracy told 'em to go away because they can't speak chinese. Like we were a club or something. XD How... exclusive!

So, the point of all this? I just might NOT be a hopeless speaker of chinese!
Also, this is the first time Jackson has said anything to me all year and I'm not sure whether to be happy or pissed off at this.
Hmmmmnnn....

Well, the true test of my skills will be if I can talk to someone I don't know by the end of the year! I hope so.

Oh, and yes, it was quite exciting, talking in chinese to someone other than my chinese TEACHER. (Hah, that makes her sound old! Muahahaha.)

Time for me to go and practice Violin! ^_^ (My grade exam is in June! Exciting, huh?)

I wish we could have visited the website with the headless human clones, but no. We weren't allowed.

Awww, my friend Tasty (That's his MSN name- I think it's the coolest.) is trying to take a good picture of himself to send to his penpal. I made a few suggestions but I'm a little worried that if he actually DOES them the poor girl might faint when she sees. (I suggested that he cover himself in whipped cream but he hasn't replied to that message yet...)

Tracy taught me to count to five in Kantonese, and told me the words for 'ground' and 'book'. 'Book' is almost the same as 'Tree'. Anyway, then she tested me by holding up rendom amounts of fingers to help me memorise. Didn't help when Charlie joined in and actually gave me THE finger. ^_____^;;;

OHHHHH Tasty replied! ""LOL You'd love it."" Pffft. Dream on darling. 

ANYwhoo, my man-bitch is so adorable. He was talking in this really bad-yet-shockingly-accurate russian accent during luchtime. Oh, and he gave me a hug at interval when I was feeling blue. He's such a nice boy. ^_^ And he had budgies! He told me about this budgie that has no colour. (No blue or yellow) which is apparently really wierd. And he REALLY knows his history. 
Oh, he told me about this type of budgie that is really small and eccentric... someone to my right commented that it sounded like me (Damn it, I'm not a midget!) and he went ""Oh, they are also cute."" And patted me on the head. I feel so loved! ^o^

I attended that seminar... it was just.... well, LONG. It took the whole day, but at least we got out every time the bell rang to walk around and at interval and lunch, of course. I feel so sick of the library today anyway. Well, I learnt some new study tips that will hopefully get me through the exams this year.
I almost crashed into Jackson going back into the library. e_e clumsy me.

Tracy taught me to say ""yes"" and ""no"", (which are REALLY easy to remember) jogged my memory on ""cold"" and ""telephone"" and taught me ""you"".
She said I don't have to learn so much at once, because we have all year... but I want to be able to talk to her properly in Chinese now! ^_^;;

At least she's teaching me the right contexts as well... unlike when I took Spanish in year 8. The teacher's accent was really bad too. It's like... a strong New Zealand accent MIXED with a fake spanish accent. *shudder*
Oh well. I can just imagine what German is gonna be like next year!

Oh, and I have a new friend. Well, he's actually my man-bitch, but that's cool. He sat randomly beside me (he was with Danielle) at lunchtime and I said ""Hey, you're pretty smexy for a man-whore."" Half-expecting him to get freaked out. He didn't. He just looked me straight in the eye and asked me how I found out about his night-job.
^_^ I love him! He's my new man-bitch. Besides, he's tall, blonde and has glasses! His name is Robert. *nod nod* Well, since Jackson is rude and Kevin is apparently taken, (more on that below) and neither of them are willing to be my man-bitch... (did I mention Robert is like TWICE my height, yet he's just ADORABLE. And his hair is so soft...)

Speaking of ADORABLE, Albie was voted off ""So you Think you can Dance?""!!!!! 
Which is like one of the two TV programs I actually watch. I love Albie, he's just SOOOO adorable. o^.^o However, he made a big mistake in choosing his solo death-row dance so I guess it was fair... but I would hate to be the judges, after he gave them his little grin and... OHMGZ. I almost cried. 
I personally thought his death-row dance was adorable... especially the slide on his knees part. BUT, it wasn't his normal style, which he would have kicked BUTT if he had done... and... I just wanted to grab him and give him a big hug... ;_;... He's just the CUTEST!!! ^o^... u_u

Anyway, mini-rant over. *sob sob* What about the weekend?!?! 


Well, the concert on Saturday was actually pretty good- Mum even bought some CDs and got them signed. Since she's fromt he newspaper she got a free programme as well as the tickets. If she keeps doing this people are going to stop giving her free stuff. ^_^; 
Well, there were some almost-flamenco spanish numbers, classical pieces originally written for piano, (which sounded pretty good on gitaur. : P) and a couple of modern classical pieces. Oh, and the gitaurist's name was Slava Grigoryan. Pity his brother wasn't at the concert too, I would have liked to see him play. ^_^ 
Who WAS there, though, was Natalie from Orchestra, some other students from Hargest that I know because they did the Senior production last year, and they always turn up at the same concerts I go to. Kevin and his family were also there, but I wasn't surprised. He always pops up randomly.... he's so annoying, in a cool kind of way. Does that make sense? Anyway, he was with another girl from school. I've seen her around... she's a nice girl. e_e 

Well, it's raining again... and for some reason Mum is being really weird at the moment... she has been ever since I had that conversation, ah, argument, with her about the Exchange Trip thing. 

Well, today I tidied my bedroom. (OH THE HORROR!) It was reading my friend Richard's blog that inspired my to look at my bedroom in a whole new way. And when I did, I almost had an aneurism. 
Had things really gotten this bad? 
I leapt from my bed with a shriek and dashed to my little potplant that I had placed affectionately on the windowsill. My poor baby! As I took it to the kitchen to give it some much-needed water, almost 
breaking my neck after tripping over my (trashy, but oh-so-MOI!) leopard-print rug as I went, I made up my mind that today would be my tidy-the-darkest-room-in-the-house (as Mum always phrases it) day. 

So, floppy Black Dragon (the plant, dears.) in hand, I marched back to my room and began to assess the damage caused by my neglectful teenage self.
(As I looked round, I had the awful niggling feeling that this is what Mum meant when she said I need to grow up and take responsibility. However, I am always right, of course, so I pushed the feeling away. It just won't do to start LISTENING to the mother now, would it?)

Well, I thought, It's not as messy as Alanna's room, but becauase I'm grown up living with a neat freak, it's time to DO something before said neat freak tries to tidy it up herself. It happened once. NOT COOL.) First to go were the five (I'm not kidding.) bags lying on the floor. (Two of which were the broken backpacks that I mentioned previously somewhere. It's official, my friends. $15 own brand warehouse bags are NOT good schoolbags. For one thing, they're not even sewn together. Besides, the blue ones are fugly.) 

So, armed with the god that is hide and the sexiness personified that is Gackt and the coolness that is my stereo, I began to clear away the junk, the clothes and the numerous other fire, earthquake and volcanic eruption hazards that carpeted my bedroom floor. 
(Yeah, it's REALLY not a good idea to balance an electric fan heater on top of a pile of excersise books, in case anyone was thinking of trying it. Especially when your collection of scented candles is placed like, RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT! I'm surprised I'm still alive. @_@)

I'm sure I don't need to bore you with the rest of the grotesquities, but it took be a good two hours to sort everything out, and then I had to sift through the piles of radom objects that had somehow accumulated on my carpet, titled ""Lost objects"", ""Found objects"", ""Borrowed objects"", (mostly makeup, sheet music and books) and ""WTF are these? objects"". What was most amusing was the amount of ballpoint pens I unearthed, and the piles of old notes I had written to my (small number of) friends during random classes last year. (Day-um, did I really write that about Stephanie? So paranoid, silly HazzaH.) (That's me, by the way. Hazz-AH! ^_^) 

Oh, and yes, my potplant lived.

Well, right now I'm-a-talkin' to my good friend Richard! Cool huh? And all thanks to the wonder that is MSN messenger. And my lovely computer that it works on. ^_^ 

I waited for AGES for someone to come online so I could try it out... it was kind of sad actually. ^_^;;; 

Tracy taught me two new words yesterday too! ""Me"" - which took me ages because I couldn't pronounce it right - and ""Phone"". Soon I'll be able to talk to her properly in Kantonese! She also taught me ""Lighter"" but I forgot what it was. She's a good teacher. 

So anyway, I amazed myself a few minutes ago by dancing along to Gekiai MERRY-GO-ROUND... and manageing to remember the entire dance... don't ask me why I decided to do it... I just had a sudden burst of energy, which is a good sign because I've been sitting here on my butt nearly all afternoon. >>;
I didn't know my brain and my arms were so co-ordinated. O_o;;

I'm just glad there was a music stand in front of my mirror... I dread to think what I looked like. @_@"

Actually, I'm lying. I got back at like 11:30. It's what, 3:00 now? Well, between practising gituar, cleaning my violin and signing up to MSN I kind of lost track of the time. So now I'm pretending to do homework and shivering because it's REALLY REALLY cold. 
Ahhh, I'm going to a concert tonight- It's an Australasian gituarist with a name I have no hope in hell of spelling right. Apparently he's a VERY good classical player so Mum got free tickets to go so she can write an article about him for our local newspaper. ^_^ I love it when she gets free concert tickets. 
So now I'm both hyper and a little fustrated because I'm trying to teach myself to play an MUCC song on gitaur... it went well until the instrumental, where I almost fell off my chair and now I have a sore butt. T_T
And when people almost fall off their chairs they tend to lose their place. 
Yep. _ _U 

In other words, I have nothing to write about. ^_^;

"event","Kimberly is alive! YAAAAY! And so am I! Although my bag broke AGAIN (Now both straps have come off... but I suppose I was asking for it, since it only cost $15... I THOUGHT it was too much of a bargain!) and I had to stand out in the rain for twenty minutes so I could get a ride home from Jess... (Thanks Jess!) But at least she had a thermos of milo to keep us warm. Nice girl, that Jess. I should ring her more often... ^_^;;) 
And so when I went on the internet I found an email from Alanna! What nice friends I have! (Actually, lots of people are being good to me this year. Karma?) I must find a way to express my love for my friends. I ain't writing no ballads though. I can just guess what they would tell me. (Money...)
Tracy also taught me a new word in Kantonese today. 'cold'. To suit the weather! She gave me a mini-test too, to see if I could remember everything. This was in math class, though. Lucky for us that our teacher, although he REALLY scared us on the first day of term, is a good guy. 
Anyway, the really interesting thing that I discovered today is that the little quiet girl Judy in my art class has a real talent for drawing! She did a cute little picture of Kero (I think it's Kero!) from Card Captor Sakura on the background of her art project. I don't know why I was surprised... I just was! It's that unconcious judgement that we make about people, then we turn out to be wrong. ^_^;
Awwww, I couldn't find my violin teacher today to ask her about lessons! Just because she missed me off the list. If it's because she won't take students from Estelle... ><;; 
I also learned a valuble lesson today. The great thing is that I can't remember what it is. -_-;;
What annoys me though is that Jackson can't even give me a ""Hi"". How rude can one guy be? And he's supposed to be a 'nice guy'. Well, I don't care. I'm not going to talk to him and be ignored or something. I've had enough of that for now, am I right? Jeez.
Oh, and my Mum says (We had a huge argument over this) she doesn't want me to spend all of my money on going overseas, and wouldn't listen to my arguments! 
What did she say? Oh.

""You won't have enough money"". - It's called SAVING and GETTING A JOB. The latter of which I'm doing as soon as I turn 15. The former I've been doing since the beginning of the year. I'll have 10,000 dollars by year 13, I'm sure!

""It'll interrupt school"". -The two-month trips are scheduled to go during summer holidays, and in any case, I get to do courses which are the equivilent to what I'm supposed to be doing at my high school.

""You're too young"". -I can wait till year 13, when I'll be about 17, and Tracy has been an international student in New Zealand since year nine. e_e

""I'd be worried sick"". -Why? I'm the one going off to a different country. I get to phone and email her as much as I want and there are special people at the schools to deal with exchange students.

Those are just the ones she bothered to cover. She ALWAYS does this. 
Well, I'm not waiting around when I'm in year 13. Then I can go whether she says I can or not, since at 17 I can move out. I was hoping to leech off her until I was halfway through college, but hey. And then she gave me the ""You're not grown-up enough to handle yourself"" and everything. HA. That made me laugh. She hasn't given me a chance as of yet to prove that I can. Of course she'll say that. I swear she was saving that argument for an occasion like this. Ahhh, now I'm angry. 
Time to listen to some hide and do my homework.

It's sooo exciting!

I went to the STS (Student Travel Schools) meeting at lunchtime today... and I might be allowed to go on an international exchange trip! Isn't that the greatest?!?!?!?! I took a brochure and a form and tonight I'm going to ask mum if she'll let me go overseas for a year or a semester. I know she'll probably say yes if I pay my own fees. Countries I have in mind that are on the website are Japan, Denmark, Sweden, China or maybe Canada. 
I'm really excited... but it's going to be really expensive and I can't go until this June onwards. 

Oh, and Tracy is teaching me Kantonese. Did I mention that? Ah well. She's teaching me one or two words every day. Already I can say ""Tree"" and ""Sky"" and ""Wind"" (as in 'a strong wind') and ""See ya!"" (as in 'I'm leaving you now')^_^ It's fun and not as hard as I thought it would be. Ok, so I wouldn't survive a year in china on four words, but I'd be able to make people laugh.

Kimberly didn't come to school again today. I'm worried! She wouldn't have wanted to miss the STS meeting. I'll have to lend her my brochure because she might be going on a trip to Japan. See, if you're reading this Kimberly, I still think of you people! Even though you leave me at school minus one rung on the social ladder. (Just kidding!)

Agg, there's not much to mention except HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHARLEEN! (That's for yesterday.) 
Oh, and ""Come back to school, idiot!"" (That's for you, Kimberly. : P)"

"event","Wow. My third week as a year 11-er and I'm still happy with EVERY class I'm in this year! Even REC. In which I grab a tennis raquet (I have to stop calling it a 'bat' now. Nobody in year 11 calls it a bat. Nobody at HIGH SCHOOL does, come to think of it.) and join Charlie. Sharleen. Oh, and I still have to make her birthday present for tomorrow. I could sing for her but I think maybe her evil side may be just waiting to get out and maul me, so maybe I won't.

Ah, and apparently on the day after tomorrow we're due for a thunderstorm! Yay! We've been having pointless rain for so long I think we deserve a lightning show. Or at least some hail or SOMETHING!

Aaaaannnyyywhhooo... I seem to have contracted a cold from Alanna when I stayed at her house friday night. It was rather fun; we stayed up late and watched some movies that at home I wouldn't be allowed to watch. (In particular 'Not Another Teen Movie', which Alanna loves because Good Charlotte make an appearance towards the end. I just didn't comment. Good Charlotte are a good band but not my favorite...) Then in the morning Alanna walked with me to my music lessons, which were uneventful and torturous(Is that a word? It should be.) because of the pneumonia that I seemed to have contracted overnight. But, that is not important. What is important is that I am still alive. Well, it's important to ME.

Well, the old hag known as Ms. Buist (I bet she's about 46, but she's the reincarnation of an old spinster living atop a half-scorched windmill that was torched by a group of angry witch hunters.) has made no more appearences in the library. Now if she can keep that up for the rest of the year then there'll be no problem. 
And there seems to be a new addition to my math class. A little ginger-haired midget from year nine. A year NINE! In a year 11 Math class! Right before we are due to take an internally assessed test on percentages and ratios! (AKA- easy peasy) Poor kid! 
Oh, and when he entered, I swear I heard someone to my right say 'A stranger... from the outside... oOoOoOoOoOo...'. This backs up my statement that there really ARE some weirdos in my year. 
I should find out who they are and give them spontaneous hugs.

BUT my sense of duty is not ~THAT~ strong, and besides- most people don't like spontaneous hugs at my school. Not even wierdos.

"event","My nose is frozen. O_o; And the title... well, we're learning about genetics in science and we saw a two-week old embryo. It looked like a little lizard 'cause it had a ling tail! SOOOOO CUTE!

Well, a lot has happened since my last update! 
So, the day before yesterday, my two good friends Kimberly and Sharleen (Hey, look, you're on the internet! :p) came round to my house so we could watch a video. We ended up watching Gackt PVs and X Japan interviews. e_e
Well, now Sharleen loves Gackt too. She's not instantly obsessed like some, (*cough*me*cough*) but she says he has a ""Hot voice and sexy with his shades on."" Personally I think he's sexy with or without glasses, but that doesn't matter... much. But I get to keep the movie we were going to watch another day, so I guess that's ok.
So anyway, the next day Kimberly didn't turn up at school! O_O Wei! Did I give her food poisoning or something? I would ring but if she's in the hospital she wouldn't be able to answer, right? So what did I do? I emailed her just now. I just realised how stupid that was. 
Now my friend Tracy has seemingly fallen in love with a boy from our Math class. He's tall, he's blonde and... well, pretty funny. She sat with him today so I grabbed Sharleen and we sat next to them so we could see what happened. Nothing except I bet they're going out by the end of the month.
Well, tracy came round to my house yesterday and ended up staying till about 9:30... and I still had homework. ^_^;;; 
But it was very fun; she brought some spicy noodles from thailand (they were translated into chinese and english on the back so we didn't burn the kitchen down... although it's amazing how much mess you can make with a kettle of hot water...) and so we put the two packets into one bowl, sat on the floor by the coffee table and dug in. My lips felt like they were on fire by the end and I think I cried a bot too, since my vision disappeared somewhere along the line, but I really really liked them. So sha gave me another packet today. ^_^;;;
So my lovely mother made veggie pizza for tea, after which Tracy and I had like a mini-kareoke/Tracy-hogged-the-gitaur session, which was on the verge of hilarious since Tracy has the look and the AIRE(Is that a real word? Is it in the right context? It is now...) of a rock star. Yaaahh, and she likes to sing. She translated bits from some Jay Chou songs for me. Isn't she nice?

Anyway, we also sent some texts (as in messages on a cellphone!) to Kevin. The first one asked if he would teach me violin... and I was only half-joking1
So he replied ""Ok, how much would she pay for an hour or half an hour?"" followed by ""Isn't she already with a tutor?"" (I didn't mention I'm thinking of changing tutors anyway, but I was surprised he was thinking about it!) and so we texted back and forth, not sure whether he knew that I was there or not, or if he thought it was just Tracy. 
In the end, he was ""waaaaaaaaay too busy"" -which is fair enough, because he already teaches people, and so Tracy said ""That's oooooooookkkkkk."" which is now our secret (well, not so secret now, since I'm putting it on the internet, but anyway...) inside joke. Yaaah. 
Anyway, I said hello to him today as he walked past, but he didn't say anything. Didn't even smile! Rude boy! T_T 
Ah well, I'm not bothered. Much.
Besides, I'm more concered as to whether Kimberly is still alive or not. Perhaps I SHOULD try to phone her?

"event","If I could I would jump up and down in circles squealing like a... squealer. But as I am currently sitting down with the keyboard shelf just over my knees, that's probably not a good idea.
Instead I'll type fast. Not that you will be able to deduct that I am excited from text on a page, but I guess the spelling errors I will make will indicate that... oh... well, I'm not making any errors right now but... Ah! Forget it!

Today I finally found my little friend. In the library, at the second table over from mine. He said hello, and I didn't recognise him. He gave me a funny look and I was suddenly all... ""AH! I know you!"" Well, I should have, but he looks a lot smarter with his school uniform on. I didn't recognise him. After all, he had his shirt tucked in.

And later on, I sat with my good friend Tracy and we talked, and she told me all about how I should eat meat. Again. I admit, I have been curious as to what REAL chicken tastes like... but never gotten round to asking if I can buy some. I just REALLY can't be bothered. Anyway, Tracy says she will bring me something tasty to try, but I'm not sure what. Anyway, it sounds interesting. 

Oh, that was last lesson, so I walked in Tracy's direction on the way home. I didn't get lost this time, at least. ^_^; And so then on the way out of school Tracy proceeded to ask me if I asked about French Horn lessons. OOPS! I forgot! Just like I forgot to bring $2 for my science teacher. _ _U Anyway, Kevin was walkign past, and I know he teaches violin or something to younger OSMC students, so I called out 

""HEY! Do you teach french horn?"" In a moment of sheer absurdity. Of course, he didn't, but he did say that the concert band or something needs a french horn player. And so I explained that oh, it wasn't me I was asking for, it was my dear friend Tracy. They then proceeded to talk in chinese. That Tracy is full of surprises.

Did I mention that Kevin is a musician I have looked up to since I started orchestra at high school? Did I mention that in my first year of high school I completely and utterly fell for him? NO, I did not. 

Did I also mention that I haven't ever really held an intelligent conversation with him for more than a few sentences up till now? 

And that he's one of the nicest people I have held an intelligent conversation with to date?

Day-um!

Oh, and he plays three instruments and is one of the top students in math and science? GAH! 

Anyway, I was just wondering what they were talkign about and hoping Tracy wasn't telling him mean things about me (You can never be too sure with Tracy) and he suddenly said ""Oh, you don't have any idea of what we're talking about do you?"" With this small goofy grin, and I was just... O_O;;; ""Nope. Not me, I hope?"" With a meaningful look in Tracy's direction. 
As he was assuring me that they were not and asking me if I played violin, (which I do, and I was surprised that he remembered) two of my friends snuck up behind me, and so we were all seperated until we had to cross the road... unfortunately he doesn't. 

So, the point of this story is that...

1. People with snobby friends (His friend who was in my class last year doesn't like me, even though I was always nice to her. e_e) generally aren't snobby at all.

2. People you are afraid to talk to are generally quite willing to hold a conversation with you, as long as you are nice to them.

3. And they're friendly too.

4. Tracy is full of surprises

5. French horn is a worthwhile instrument to play, and if you play violin you shouldn't have too much trouble picking it up. (At least, that's what HE said.)

And so, put in a good mood by a pleasant surprise, I leave you to wonder who the heck is putting this stuff on the net.

She just gets cuter and cuter, doesn't she?

I always thought I should start a new journal with a big bang. Something to commemorate the occasion. After all, it is not often I start new things. Most often, I tend to ditch things. But alas, today was just another school day, in which I recieved homework and lost another point from my karma. 
Yes, my already wounded karma, peppered with bullet holes, is on the verge of falling into firey oblivion and being kicked out of its school library for good. Yes, already, five days into the school year, the troll that god named Ms. Buist is on the prowl, preying apon the souls, nerves and souls of myself and my friends. And why does such a creation exist (and why does she have the title of ""Ms"" instead of the regular ""Miss"" or ""Mrs""? It must be because she is too old to be unmarried, yet she doesn't want to admit to never having been married. I almost feel sorry for that old gryphon.) on this mortal coil? Why was she not burned at the stake back in her teenage years when the execution of 'Hags' (I refrain from saying 'witches' because that would be both insensitive and an insult to my wiccan friend...) was a social holiday. 
But no, Ms. Buist is already bearing her foul little fangs, and is prowling about the school library, a once respectable haven where students could partake in fairly quiet, leisurely activities such as reading at lunch time, making sure nobody gets to have any fun. 
To me, drawing is fun. Little girly ugly creatures, yes, I like them. Whether I am any good at them or not is not up to me, because I am never happy with anything I draw. But, drawing is fun, and the library is a good place to do it. It has tables, chairs and good lighting. It is clean, there is plenty of space and it's generally quiet. It's a PERFECT place to do some drawing. And so, I go there every day, save for the days I have extracurricular activities on. And now, maybe Wednesdays too, for who is the teacher on duty in the library? Ah. Ms. Buist. Horrid Woman, ugh.
So there I was, sitting at a table, with my friends who had arrived before me. I began to ink in a particular drawing I had been trying to finish. (It's a cute/ugly little chibi-ish-thing I wanted to use as my avatar when I finished it.) Another of my friends (I don't really have that many friends... just a handful of nice people I have met along the road to today-dom.) Sat down at our table. However... GASP! she was empty-handed, and the Hag's delinquent-sensor went off. She strode over to our table, plate in hand. (She finds the time to tell other students off for eating in the library, between mouthfuls of her foul cafeteria... well, who can tell what it is?)
""I see some of you don't have books or work to do."" 
She also has the mental capacity to state the obvious. Clever woman. e_e 
At this, my empty-handed friend began to squirm, looking rather uncomfortable. Under the Troll's gaze, I began to spin an un-original story.

""Oh, she's waiting for someone to return her textbook that they borrowed from her."" I said. ""For homework."" I added, since she is so keen on it. There was a pause, and the beast looked at me over her hooked nose.

""I don't want to see any of you not doing anything, or drawing this year while I am on duty, you hear?"" There was another pause, and I got up. By this time I was feeling harassed, and so as she left, I began to pack up.

There is not much point staying somewhere when you are only going to become a nervous wreck under the watchful eye of someone who SHOULDN'T have anything against you... but does.

And the point of this story? Well. As a generally polite student who has nowhere else to GO and improve her skills as an artist, I feel almost as if my space has been violated. If it was nearing the end-of-year exams, or if the library was crowded, or even if my friends and I were drawing attention to ourselves by being raucous, I would accept the fate of my Wednesday lunchtimes. However, my friends and I were doing none of these things, and I feel that if we all were actually engaged in an activity, she would never have seen fit to come near us anyway.
In my opinion, she doesn't like me. It's isn't my friends, as usually they read or do homework, yet I still get targeted for talking. Need I mention that usually I'm not even talking LOUDLY. There are plenty of raucous students that attemt to disturb the peace in the Library. They are dealt with justly. But me? I am hassled. If I didn't know any better, I would say it's because of what I do. Maybe she does have something against drawing, simply because it's not reading or studying. It's never a problem with the other teachers. Usually I get compliments!

Oh, well. Unless I complain, I'll have to put up with it. Until anything else serious and karma-damaging (Well, wishing a teacher would die DOES seriously dent karma!) occurs in my life I'll go back to being my normal self.

Oooh... a boy in my english class (And I thought he was supoposed to be NORMAL?) can breathe out of his eyeballs. Well, I have no actual proof but everyone sitting near us believes him. How grotesque! ...I love it!

Oh, and my good friend gave me her tamagotchi. Chuu! I love those things! Sure, they're outdated and were cool when I was about five years old, but aww... it's so cute. It's a #1 (Is that right? I don't know anything about it, I'm just learning as I go!) and it's DEAD... but it has a reset button which I'm hesitant to press in case I break it or something. 

Ack, looks like I have to finish here now, because I have a violin lesson in thirty minutes (I'm introducing my strictly-classical teacher to folk music. If I can do that I can do anything!) and I haven't showered, done any homework or ANYTHING, so until tomorrow...

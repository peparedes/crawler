&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the days slowly progressed, everyone tried to get on with their daily lives, although it was easier said than done. Bailey was being linieunt with her interns, knowing that this was hard for them. The attendings were, too. It was hard on everyone. It affected everyone. Each took turns sitting down in Meredith's room. Derek and Cristina, George, Izzy, Alex, Bailey, and occasionally, even Addison. They all felt like they had to protect her in some way, especially the older adults.&nbsp; And although Bailey didn't like to admit it, she had a soft spot for all of her interns. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was on her mind as she finished her shift and headed into to Meredith's room, much like she had when Cristina had come out of surgery months ago. Meredith had fallen while trying to help someone. If that wasn't heroic, she didn't know what else was. 
Meredith slowly moved in her bed as Miranda jolted a bit, waking from her light sleep. 
""Meredith?""
Meredith tried to speak but her mouth was too dry, as Bailey gave her some water.
""Do you know what happened, Meredith?""
She nodded. ""I don't feel the greatest.""
Bailey smiled. ""I could imagine you don't. Everyone will be happy to see you though. I'm glad you're up.""
Bailey got up and patted Meredith's hand. ""Ready for some visitors?""

Bailey wandered down the hall, looking for her interns, which she found around the hospital. Luckily, they were either in the Pit, or having lunch. Derek was in surgery but she would tell him after.
""Meredith's awke, but I don't want you to tire her out, you understand? She's been through a lot. You know the drill, one at a time.""

This time, Cristina was first.

Meredith managed a smile as Cristina took her usual seat. ""Hey,"" she whispered, her voice still not fully recovered.
""Hey,"" Cristina said.
""Burke and I are engaged,"" she blurted out. ""I wanted to tell you in the locker room, but you were in a bad mood, and I should have, and I.. I thought it was too late.""
Meredith asked seriously, ""Is this what you really want?""
""I thought it was. Then he got mad at me because he didn't understand that you're my person. We just don't seem to get each-other. I love him, but it's so complicated.""
Meredith held a hand out to Cristina, who, after a second's pause, took it and gave it a squeeze.
""Hey person, I'm really glad you're okay."" 
""Cristina? You're my person too, you know.""
Cristina leaned down to give Meredith a hug. The concept of hugging seemed strange, and she wasn't sure if she had even done it before. With Meredith though, it seemed as normal as it could. Just someone hugging their best friend.
""I'll send George in,"" Cristina said.

An excited George entered, as he bent over to give Meredith a long hug.
""I'm so glad you're okay,"" he said. ""Everyone was so worried...""
Meredith smiled. ""What else did I miss lately?""
As George talked, Meredith laughed along with him. It felt so nice to loved.

Izzy was next, and she talked just as much as George did, so much so, that Meredith put a hand to stop her.
""Izzy, enough. I'm tired, but I'll say this. You love George,and he does love you, but you're suffocating him. There's no need to be jealous, but you are insanely jealous. It's going to ruin your relationship if it continues.""
Meredith, once again, had saved Izzy, as Izzy reached over and squeezed her hand. ""Thanks, Mere.""


Next- Derek, Alex, go to see Mere and more."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Ch.2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hospital seats were uncomfortable, Cristina realised as she sat sitting in the waiting room with Izzy, George, and Alex. It felt so wierd without Meredith. Her sitting was interrupted by the ahaken sight of Derek, who took a seat next to them.
""Have you seen her?"" Cristina asked.
""She's the same,"" Derek sighed. ""You guys can go in one at a time.""
""Cristina?"" Izzy asked. 
Cristina shook her head. As much as she wanted to, she couldn't. Not just yet.
""Not yet.""
At the shaken heads of the other interns, Izzy headed down the hall.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meredith had regained some of her color. That was Izzy's first reaction as she stared at her friend, and took a seat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Hey,"" she whispered. Izzy took a look at the monitor that was monitoring Meredith's temperature. ""You gotta wake up, you know. Or else I'm going to be in the house all by myself. I'm already lonely with the thought of losing you. No-one really understands me and accepts me the way you do- especially not George lately. I need to have you wake up. Okay? Please? I don't think it's too much to ask.""
Izzy sat back in the couch. ""Just get warm. Get better.""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George was in next, as he gingerly took ahold of Meredith's hands, willing himself to stop crying. The tears just seemed endless. Death was too close to him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mer, you need to wake up. You can't die. I've lost so much already, and I'm not going to lose you too. We've had our difficulties in the past, but we've still remained good friends. I'm not going to lose out on our friendship. I need you. I need you to wake up, I need to see your smile. I need to see Cristina whole again. She's really taking this hard. Just please. Wake up.""

Alex's turn now.

"" Sometimes it seems you're the only one on my side. When everyone is critisising me, you back me up. You help me with so much- I&nbsp; think if you hadn't helped me study for my exam rewrite, I would've failed.&nbsp; I need you to wake up. I need our ""I'll tell you a secret if you tell me one too."" I need to tell you. I think I'm falling for someone.""

Finally, Cristina.

She walked into the room, slowly. It was wierd how it felt different to be in a room where your best friend was actually a patient. It felt wierd. A foreign concept. One that she hadn't thought of.

""Burke and I are engaged. I wanted to tell you first before he told Derek, but it didn't work. And now he's mad at me, and he doesn't understand that you're my person. That we're each-other's person. Men sometimes. I just don't understand. And I want you to wake up, okay? I *need* you to wake up. You're my only real family and I'm not going to lose you."" Cristina felt tears well up in her eyes. ""If you did, I wouldn't be able to stand it."""

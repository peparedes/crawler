BUT. and yes ther is a butt it is that the pervy teacher strikes again.&nbsp;<br /></font></p><div class=""ljcut"" text="" more..."">it was great day and i was waiting to go home (i get lifts) so i was w8teing 4 my dad an the teacher thats not to be named came up and told me to relax. I was like what &amp; he put his hand on my legs and started feeling them. It was around my knee but it still felt weird. Then he started hitting my leg and i was like what are you doing! then he said i dont have reflexes or whatever. and i was like oh! but then..<br />the guy that was sitting to the left of me on another chair started hitting my leg too. then i said ow! get off and he did but the teacher said ""be gentle!"" and he looked at me &amp;&amp;&amp; said ""if i was you i'd give him a big kick!"" and i said well im not like that and he said ""well she's gentle you see!""<br />then the boy started hitting me again and i was like ow. get off. and he did but then the teacher (not to be named said ""be gentle be gentle! you've got to be gentle! then he said to him ""we need to treat the female sex very gently."" and he said it so loud that the other teachers sat round a table about 5 metres away looked over. i laughed really loudly and the teacher started going on about the gentle genital (pronouncing it geneet-al) and i really did cringe at this point. i still laughed because i didnt take him seriously and the other boy was laughing his head off aswell.<br />then the teacher started drawing (don't ask why) and he called me over. and i went over to him and he backed away from the boy with his swirly chair and mumbled something. i said ""what?"" and he asked me whether my headache had gone. i said yeah it's fine and he did a thumbs up then i sat back down. <strong>why did he call me over FOR THAT? having a headache isnt a private matter! could he have mumbled something different at the beginning?????<br />AND TO TOP IT OFF! HIS SON &amp; GRAND-DAUGHTER LIVE OPPOSITE ME!</strong></div>"

"event","<strong><font size=""3"">Ok<br />We were doing ICT at school and we were making webpages and my friend Michelle* was on a quiz site, and there was a cocktail one, where she entered a name and it came up how to make it etc for a bit of fun.<br />She did one of my teacher Mr Butler*, and he came and had a look. I had a quick peep aswell and I laughed and he&nbsp; looked at me, bit his lip and said ""<font color=""#ff0000"">I hope I taste nice</font>"".<br />In the lesson I couldn't log on, and he apologised and said he must have 'removed' me as there was another&nbsp;Mandy* last year, (i didn't really believe him)<br />It was just me and my friend Michelle* in the room, and him of course, when he was doing my account for me, i logged on because he told me to and we went on the internet. He went on Google Images and asked me who I liked. I said no-one and he said ""everybody's gotta like someone"", and he typed in Hermoine Granger from harry potter.<br />And I said ""But i don't like her"" and he said ""well i like her, <font color=""#ff0000"">i don't like men you see, i like women<font color=""#000000"">''</font></font><font color=""#000000""> </font>and me and my friend laughed but secretly I was thinking hmm.. what's going on here. And when we giggled he said ""You don't have to giggle about it you know"", kind of sternly.<br />And also I told him to put in Johnny Depp before he really stepped over the line and he got pictures, and saved it in my file without my permission. I didn't really say anything but he said ""It's okay to have pictures you know""<br />Michelle* was on google images too on another computer and she typed in Tom Felton and there was a picture of him without a top on, and she wanted it but he said ""No that is disgusting, we don't let you print pictures of topless women off so we won't let you print topless men off"" <br /><br /><br />Just a quick update ^</font></strong>"

"event","<p><font color=""#33cccc"" size=""4"">thanks to the fantastic people that gave me tonz ov advice over this issue, i'm more aware of what he's doing and how he's talking to other pupils and it's not the same as how he talks to me, i'm learning to deal with it, if anything does happen i'll think harder about what to do. I would confront him like some of you suggested but i don't think i'd be confident enough to do that. He's threw a mouse at the wall and got angry with a girl in my ICT class and she ran off crying because she wouldn't do what he said. I'm scared of him getting angry like that again, and maybe threatening me. I'll make sure nothing REALLY bad happens otherwise i'll tell someone.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><font color=""#3366ff"">What he's done so far and how he acts</font><br />* told me to wait after class and do my webpage, with him i'm guessing<br />* patted the back of the chair where my bum was then left the room<br />* told me to ""wait till later"" then wink at me<br />* makes me laugh, or tries to, like all the time<br />* sits really close with me<br />* looks out for me alot and helps me with my schoolwork, alot<br />* makes sure i'm listening to him<br />* gets angry in front of me<br />* stares at me, and when i look at him it doesn't put him off<br />* stare at my legs * gave me something to do in a detention that i'd enjoy&nbsp;and let the 3 other girls sit and stare in space<br />* said ""she didn't deserve a detention"" when the teacher talked about me<br />* laughs at things i say<br />* sits really close to me, legs almost touching, when helping me with my work<br />* touching me, like on the arm<br />* when ive been sat down and he's been going to the stock room, he touched my hair a bit, and NOT my friends<br />* greets me when i come into the room and doesn't anyone else<br />* sits opposite me when doing the register, always (i've experimented by mving tables)<br />* compliment me by saying ""you have been a real star, you've been so quiet and that's good""<br />* grabbed my arm, pulled it down and told me to stop worrying when i've been biting my fingers<br />* looked at the back of my skirt and smiled at me (today)<br />* talked about people bedding each other to me&nbsp;without anyone else in the room (also today)<br /></font></p>"

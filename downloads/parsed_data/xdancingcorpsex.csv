"event","Her nails are painted black
Matching her dress and hat
Her face is painted white
Delicately catching all light

Her ears are decorated
With beads and bones
her eyes are decorated
With glitter and stones

Every bit of her, is a work of art
Her lips are piercing, her hair so dark

It's never enough
No, it's never enough
Waiting for your love
Hating all other love

I wish I was good enough
I wish it was I you loved
I wish I was still good enough
For you

But I fucked it all up"

"event","Fruit of the womb
It's all happened too soon
Buried amongst the rest
Dear, sweet head
Lay beneath the stars
Waiting
To be told who you are
Fruit of the womb

Seed of the tree
Neither you nor me
Planted amongst the rest
Dear, sweet head
Lay beneath the moon
Waiting
To be told of your gloom
Seed of the tree

Bowl of fruit
And glass of juice
Thought of amongst the rest
Dear, sweet head
Lay beneath the paint
Waiting
To be told it's all the same
Bowl of fruit"

"event","I'm not shy
I just don't talk too much
I only want to cry
Because I'm lacking in trust

Insecure
Because I have more
Important things to think about

Emotionally unstable
Because I'm not able
To understand this behavior

Become my savour

I'm not quiet
I like it without noise
I only want to hide
Because I'm lacking in choose

Unable to sleep
Because these things
Have started haunting me

Slightly obsessive
Maybe a little jealous
I might get around to telling you later

Become my savour

It's not because I think no one loves me
It's because I don't love myself
And you people that care about me
Just aren't enough

I know I'm not worth anything
I know no one listens to me
I'm unimportant

I know I can act kind of strange
Because what's happening in my head isn't happening
I just hate her

Become my savour

I'm not shy
I just don't talk too much
I only want to cry
Because I'm lacking in trust
Lacking in love
Lacking in lots of other stuff"

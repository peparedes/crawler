"event","So, I guess maybe I just need to say this stuff, for whatever reason, but someone told me that since it upset me so much I should just put it out there. Okay. My parents never had a great marriage. My Mom was sick and she didn't do the best job, especially with my older sisters, with me I guess she was a little better. I know they got it a lot worse than me. And when my parents split up when I was ten on the outside I was excited, ready to try this knew life, because come on. Everyone had been expecting it. Despite my father being a preacher and us looking perfectly normal, anyone who spent anytime with us as a family knew that wasn't the truth. So when they split and I went with Mom, so did my sister Katie. Rachel stayed with Dad. Mandy and Jenn were both out of the house already. For a few years I bounced around between Mom and Dad, mostly just because I missed one or the other too much and had to move back in with them. But then last summer I moved the last time, with my Mom. My Mom is one of my three best friends. I love her more than life itself. She gives up so much for me and I love her for it. We don't have the best life or a lot of money but if she knows I really want something she <em>always </em>finds a way for me to have it. My older sisters still blame her for everything that goes wrong with my family really. And I don't blame them so much. They got it a lot worse than I did. But she was sick. And now she's better. And sometimes I don't think they see that. I don't think they would ever admit that my Dad had any fault in my parents marriage not working out and thats what makes me crazy. I love him, I really do. but sometimes he makes me crazy. And while my mother has a lot of faults, he does too. He calls like once a month, maybe. My sisters are like ""You could call him."" But come on, lets face it. I'm fourteen. I'm not always going to think about it, and its long distance for me. I just think if he cared he would call more. Not only that but its just other stuff. I know its whiney but he was my DAD when I was little. He was around a lot. Now its like he dropped off the face of the earth. He didn't even send a <em>card</em> at Christmas. He didn't call. He didn't do&nbsp;anything! I remember when I got my card from my sister (Whom he lives with) and he hadn't even signed it. I cried all night to Tasha. My Mom went broke trying to give me a good christmas, but it wasn't even about money, cause I know he doesn't have alot. It was about caring. And he didn't. Doesn't. Whatever. My Mom may have been horrible a long time ago. But shes a great person now. I think some people don't see that. My Dad did contribute to their marriage ending. He stood <em>idly </em>by. And it makes me crazy that everyone blames my Mom. What triggered this? I'm spending the summer with my sister, the one who my Dad lives with. And its been a great time. But me and my Dad haven't really hung out. And I guess he just doesn't do that. Hang out. He makes me breakfast sometimes. And we played a few games of X-box, but we haven't done anything. Whatever, its cool. But then we're supposed to go to the movies tomorrow. No big deal you know. And this movie I've wanted to see for forever is coming out. Dad doesn't want to see the movie. So he might just send my brother in his place. At this point its not about the movie at all. I just wanted to spend time with him! I just wanted to hang out with him. And he doesn't get that. He never will. I'm growing up, I've grown up a lot in the past year, but with him I'm still the same little girl, because I never got the chance to grow into the young lady with him. I don't see him walking me down the aisle, I don't really think he deserves it. I would much rather have someone who is more involved in my life like one of my brothers, John or Marty, do it. I see Dad now with my niece Julianna. And he goes on and on about how much he loves her and how precious she is and&nbsp;he hugs all on her. And&nbsp;I don't remember him being that way with me. It's stupid being jealous of her. Because she's a little kid. But I am. I want to be that girl. I wanted. At this point I'm a bit over it. I just&nbsp;know that as long as my Dad lives, Julianna will be in his life, no matter what. And I can't stand feeling like I've been...I don't know, replaced. I'm just over it.&nbsp;He'll always be my father. But I haven't had a Dad in a long time. I hate this feeling, because&nbsp;I'm never vulnerable like this, and I never have this feeling like I just can't stand someone. But&nbsp;its happening. I hate it. It's not anything that can be fixed now, its done. And maybe thats how my sisters feel about my Mom.&nbsp;But to me,&nbsp;my mom is the world. I love her more than anyone without exception. I'm done crying over it, and after this&nbsp;I'm done thinking about it. Whatever. Plenty of people don't have great relationships with there parents, so if you're reading this and you are like ""Stop whining"" I'm sorry. But I never want my kids to feel like they weren't&nbsp;important enough. Or something. If you read all of this, then you probably don't have&nbsp;a life. But I love you for it.&nbsp;<br />Ooh and if someone could explain to me how to hide this behind a cut, I'll love you for it! Sorry I don't know how to do them yet!<br /><br />heather<br />"

"event","My first journal entry! I feel as if this warrants like...IDK some kind of alcoholic beverage. Except, you know I'm underage so I don't partake in alcoholic beverages. Or anything that wouldn't be permitted in my Preacher dads house. Yeah. I feel as if this is bound to be more addictive than Myspace (SINCE MY PAGE GOT DELETED GRR) mostly because there I talked to people I knew, and therefore was already bored of, and here I know nobody and therefore feel more free to be myself...is that odd? Well, if you knew my friends and family you would understand. I'm a PK (preachers kid) and live in just about the most strict household in America...except not so much anymore since my Mom left my Dad and I went with her. She's still strict, and if she knew anything about me she'd say I was going to hell. And that's not judgemental in her opinion. I have four sisters...yea I still have to count them. But they are all older and married with the kids and SUV's and that kind of stuff. I was mostly a lurker here on LJ but finally couldn't resist and got this...thought i have no idea how to do anything with my page. So I'm really sorry that you guys are now subject to my insanity but I can't help it. I thought maybe I wold stop ranting and tell you some about me: 

1. I'm going to be a sophmore. Yes, I still have three more years in hell. 
 
2. I secretly watch horrible WB shows but bash them publicly. 

3. I'm in love with both Jdoh and KB and can't decide which is hotter. Though if forced I guess I'd say Jason. 

4. I have a Tasha. What is a Tasha you may ask...she's the best friend a girl could have...who I frequently find myself making out with. No, really its not complicated.

That's just about all there is to know about me. Oh I'm also a Starbucks-aholic and if I'm not on the computer I'm probably watching Veronica Mars with my nephew. This probably sucks and if you read it all then bless you, but they'll get better. Besides I only got this to post teh smut. And we all enjoy that :P

"event","Well, horrible week has sort of come to an end. Both mentally & physically this week has been terrible for me. I really can't pin point any one thing that caused it...perhaps just a stress break down. I don't know. The weekend kinda helped me to put myself back together, but, finding out my car is worthless doesn't help.

So I just want to take this space here to formally apologize to anyone directly affected by my bad week. Ask me why it happened, I don't know why it happened...but it did. I think i'm together again...so, lets start over & forget the past week, k?

....and speaking of the car,,...if you would like to donate to get my car fixed, it would be greatly appreciated...........

g'night all"

"event","yea, its that time again. I'm home for Christmas break. As soon as I got in, I wanted to watch the blue jackets vs. teh devils. Wasn't on (GRRRRRRRR)but, hey, the jackets won anyway 4-2. So then mom was showing me things she got for em for christmas. I wanted a christmas gift NOW....so, i begged & told her 'i don't have any pants that really fit. they're alltoo big' so she decided to give me a pair of jeans she got me...a 22...so i put them on, and, well, WAY too big. she's like ""um...shit. try these on' and she pulls out another pair of pants she got me for chrsitmas. also a 22. yeas, too big. she's like 'oh shit.' so i got happy & went to dad's and started trying on all my old dresses & stuff. yea, my HS graduation dress, fits me better now than it did then! i love this. hehe. she's like 'um, i think i'm gonn ahave to take you shopping before i buy anything else'

Granted he treated me like crap, I still did have feelings for him to an extent. I felt ok knowing that he was in norfolk, and 8 hour drive away, and that he'd prolly come home with clayton again & I'd prolly get to see him.... Now that he's in Ireland for good now, I feel horrible....cause now the chance of working things out....is prolly not gonna happen. I wish I would have messaged him when I had the chance...."

yea, i'm so upset about that, and that's not all. The jackets are totally fucked. With neilsen gone, they just screwed syracuse....and nummelin was good to. SO, now that syracuse is screwed: check this out. Jean Luc Grand-Pierre is on the injured reserve, so who did they call up: Westcott. *eye roll* Let me tell ya how this is gonna work: IT WON'T !!!
Columbus is screwed, Syracuse is screwed, and with Syracuse being screwed, they prolly call up a bomber or 2, so depending on who they call up, THEY'LL be fucked over too. 

the next thing that actually scares me is that Espen Knutsen is being sent to surgery, and they don't even know what's wrong with him! Its somethign with his lower abdominal area, so, hopefully its nothign so bad he won't skate again.....then, we'd be fucked.

Anyway, I'm done bitching for now. I just realized, the Blue Jackets don't rank high, not because of the players have no talent, but because Doug Maclean & his crew can't make good decisions....."

Every night here (so far anyway) has been spent at mom's new house. I spend a lot of time here. Wednesday I helped mom work the kitchen at bingo, and had choir practice. Went to thanksgiving mass...saw Joey. As an old UD student, we chatted & all that. Joe's awsome! Then dinner was at the Downard residence. It was great times. That night: adam c. (now neighbor) and james, 2 of my friends/classmates came over to fix mom's sink, brought the beers...but couldn't do it, so we chilled & drank. then we found out there was a party at Dustin's! so, we called & had chanda come in & get us. hehe. Went out there & saw people I graduated with that I haven't seen in a long time. I miss them all, and it was funny, cause I've never been drunk around them. LOL! Awsome. Wade was out there... interesting to say the least *angel face on* anyway....we chilled & i acme back to the house. me, chanda & wade chilled for a little. wade went home, i passed out, and chanda went to work. poor girl. Friday: party at chanda's I didn't go out till like 1:30, but sara & wade were still there (and obviously chanda) we chilled & watched some late  night HBO & the MAX...0:) ya know. then wade & i left. sara was staying there. SO, here I am typing.Spent time with Krystal today too.  Also earlier today, I spent  like 3 hours at the PDQ talking to ryan. I love talking to him. He's so awsome. I still love him. and he knows this, but, I just know nothing will come of it. Him & I are gonna have a long talk when I'm home for christmas, just me & him. somewhere otehr than the PDQ, and nobody else around. It'll be fun. Hopefully get some things out in the open...everything about a year ago, and well, just stuff. I can't wait.
N-E-way......I'm going to go to bed. Nighty!!!!"

"event","Lots of stuff has happened since the last update. I'm beginning to get into that stress mode. Friday was the last friday PoD rehersal for the year. Always fun. ANd saturday was the last game.  As much as i like PoD and the people in it, I was glad to see the season come to an end. Friday & Saturday was also opera workshop weekend. Friday night I sang int he chorus, and afterwards went to see Abandon with Brian, his 2 friends from Erie & Katie. It was an Ok movie, but, eh..don't spend too much on it. Saturday: mom came for the game. She was supposed to cook for me, but instead her, my sister & katie made an executive decision to order pizza from dominos.....gee, thanks for asking guys.  I went to see the Opera Workshop too. It was really good. Now, to write a paper on it. Saturday night there was a party at Traci's so, of course, like a good girl, I went. Always fun times. :) Came home in the rain & passed out. Didn't get up for noon mass (sorry brian!) but, all was good.
10 PM mass was good. interesting homily. And, well, Brian hates me now...LOL! oops. I should keep my mouth shut.
Tonight, I went to classes...Swing Band was really a release. Sat around, and then did PoD group &  section pics. 
Came home & started to do MORE work... and then went to a Diversity Dinner. It was really fun, and interesting. Met some interesting people. I'm really glad I went. 

Also, all day sunday, I CLEANED MY ROOM! most of it anyway. I did pretty well. I just have some little things I have to deal with. But, the big pile is gone. BE PROUD!

But now, it's time for more work"

"event","FUN: tonight was the pledge recital, and I did a duet with my little. she kicked major ass, brandon (our accomp.) kicked ass,.me on the other hand didn't kick so much ass, but I wasn't important. my little was the one who was important. then afterwards my little treated me to dinner at Panera. It was great fun! we just got to sit & talk. went home, changed & then went to her room for b-day cake (HAPPY B-DAY CHRIS!!) then i went to my friend michelle's room in marycrest. always great fun...bitching about boys, plotting to get boys. things like that. always fun :-D LOVE YOU MICHELLE!

randomness:
random #1: i was talking to anne marquett today on campus, and this girl (who turned out being from my EDT class last year) just came up to me & told me i really look good after changing my hair & stuff. i look really nice apperently. It was totally random, but I do appreciate the fact that SOMEONE is paying attention. 

random #2: i walk into reichard for the pledge recital, and marabeth (spelling?) is standing there watching jane & michelle K. making up a flyerette routine, and she's like 'wow, you've got that groove down on the field. attitude & everything!' wow. LOL! that was jsut like...um....""i try. thanks"" i keep tellin her i'm doing the flyerette clinics in april. she thinks i'm jsut teasin her when i do the dance like that & play with poms. WATCH ME ! no trying out though, i love my trumpet too much. 

Random #3: after pledege recital, i turn the corner after putting my horn away, and there stans saunders. definately didn't expect to see him there.......and the fact that he remembered that i am gonna have a party in early next semester for my b-day. totally odd.....

random #4: as i was leaving michelle's room tongiht, I go out the side door, ind out of the trash can jumps a raccoon. I hate those things. It was a huge fucker too...needless to say, i went the OPPOSITE direction of the dark side, the OPPOSITE directoon that that raccoon was standing and walked the long way. I hate those things. they steal marshmallows, and bite people. GO TO HELL RACCOON !!! DIE DIE DIE !!!

anyway, I'm off to bed. I need to dream of someone, and how to get them more in my life. NIGHTY!"

But the real fun began that night when we were singing tuck-ins. Yea, I was in Greg Kohls' bedroom *grin* Yea, it was awsome. there's no words to put here....LOL!But another fun tuck-in was Nate's. We tracked him down at the field house & sang to him. It was funny. Who would ever think of that? 
after tuck-ins i practiced with my wittle :D  I WUV MY WITTLE!!!!!! We're doing a clarinet duet (I'm playing trumpet obviously) for the pledge recital. It'll be great fun. The duet is kinda hard, but we kicked ass on it. It's not perfect, but hey, what can you expect from 2 people practicing together for the fist time without looking at it first? 

Friday was a yuck day weather wise, but event wise...awsome. I went to Fri @ 1 because I told Brian I'd be there to come hear his German song. He did well...and philosophy ended up being cancelled anyway! so YAY! After that was swing band run through of the concert....then PoD pictures. I can't wait to see those. They'll be fun, especially the buddy pics I got. I got one with my wittle (again, i WUV my wittle) adnt ehn I got one with michelle & ally, my 2 flyerette friends. they each had a trumpet, and I held Poms. after pics were all said & done.......some food...then it was Jazz concert time. the concert went awsome. I presonally flubbed, but who doesn't ya know? I can't wait to hear the recordign. I know it was TYTE! The jazz ensamble....always Tyte....so, yea. Concert done, tear down & then my mom, my dad, dorothy & pam (family friends from home), me & katie all went to Marions for pizza. It was yummy. I had my beer, had my pizza. had my salad. I was a happy camper (not to mention very full) Came home, and Katie & I watched CLUE & SPACEBALLS and had a mixed drink each. It was a good night. Couldn't ask for it to be any better. 

This AM (well afternoon) Katie & I went to marycrest for breakfast jsut like the olden days. :) I miss the olden days...but I LOVE living in a house. (and I didn't get up till 1 today!!!) 

anyway, I'm out. time to chill in the room i have to myself, or chill with kaite....who knows. prolly watch spaceballs again> LOL!"

<h2>Nope. Definitely not bisexual. Thank you for trying ;)</h2>
Although you only like to eat one kind of meat,<br>
that doesn't mean you are any less of a sexual gourmand.<br>
You just  choose only the finest of dicks/breasts<br>
(whichever strikes your particular gender's fancy)<br>
and enjoy them with the style and panache that ideally suits you.

So, anwyay, the cool shit is that I took my pics to walmart for 1 hour, and when I went to pick them up, they goofed & said they only printed singles. It'll be another 10 minuutes to get my doubles. Ok,no prob. so I walk around,m  talk, yada yada....come back....still not done. another 5 or so minutes. yada yada bullshit...come back & they told me no charge on my pictures. I defenately got double prints of about 38 pictures for free (yea, 76 pics total) All I spent at wal-mart was $4.75 for a small photo album & a new black bra. go figure!!
now it's time to scan these pics on daddy's new scanner *grin*"

I told him ok, that things are completely done with one (duncan) and I'd really like to date another (Chris). He said that was cool, and I should try....then after talking for a while, he turns the whole thing into sex talk. I told him I am off of doing anything sexually for a while, because i'm not into the possibility of making the duncan mistake again. (losing a friend in this case actually) He keeps begign & begging. If he wasn't begging me, I would maybe have concidered it...but...sheesh!! I just don't undertand....."

not quite how I wanted it to end, but, I guess I should have been smarter about this.

"event","Well, it started out ok. My cousin Brandi got here at like 8 or so and brought me ski & came for a quick visit, which was all cool. It was her b-day today. I gave her a pinwheel, and I've never seen someone so amused. LOL!

So, after I walked with her & her guy back to the truck, I went to my friend Becky's for a little party because it was her birthday too!!! After a while, I got thinking that I didn't have my keys, so I called over to my house, and asked if the doors would be unlocked. They said they should be and I said ok.  I dind't think anymore about it, and I chilled more at becky's. When I was ready to go home, I came over, and both doors were locked. GRR! SO I go back over to Becky's (which is right across the parking lot) and I call back over here. Nobody answered. I kept callign & calling....no answer. So, I was getting mad. A guy that was at Becky's, Kevin, was trying to get me to go out with them to a club, but I told him I couldn't get into the house anyway. I didn't have money, and I look like crap. He still wanted me to go. I said I should go home, but I can't get in. I eventually asked him if he'd help me break into my house, cause I know we have an open window. So he said yea, and he took out the screen, climbed in the window, and unlocekd the door for me. He's awsome. We chatted for anotehr couple minutes, and he gave me his SN, told me he MIGHT be on some, but, not very often. ANd he said he likes it here & might come down for my 21st. So, killer!

Anyway, I'min the house & ready for bed....I get to my room upstairs & the door is locked. So, i stood there banging on the doro for a few mintues until finally my roommate's boyfriend finally let me in. I'm so mad. this is the 3rd time this has happened this year. I mean about the room, not the house. Anyway, I just needed to vent. I'm going to bed, because I need to get up in the AM & get to reichard by like 8am. So, good night.....

Oh, and Kevin is still a great guy....hehe. That's the best part fo the night. LOL!"

We marched today out in the rain, cause afterall, everyone knows ""The sun always shines on the Pride."" I didn't mind being in the rain, but, my jeans did. My jeans wern't that wet since I sat in the pool at ETPi at the party. I came home, and put on dry jeans, a dry shirt, and my hockey jersey. 
Chris Radak though, I hope he's nice & warm & dry now. He marched half the time in nothing but shorts, tennis shoes, and a clear poncho. You are brave chris. Stupid.......but brave. LOL!

I had a liong talk with rachel last ngiht, and i hate it when she's right. GRR!

I also talked with Chris briefly tongiht. We just chatted, and he said he was thinking about getting his hair in cornrows & that he got his ears peirced. I told him I was looking for something to change too, and said I have just been told to put my best feature forward. I said I got nuttin, and he's like sure ya do. I asked him what......he said I have a good smile. Not one of the features I would have picked, but, ok. Do I really have a good smile? I dunno.......Ah well, I guess I'l have to find some way to accent my smile from now on...and I was thinking eyes too...I dunno.
WHy am I oso caught on Chris? he's a wonderful guy, yes, but, am I his type? I just don't seem like it. I don't know. I thougth about asking him to a movie when I go home again, but, only if I have money. I don't know *shrugs* What do you think?

I have an advisor offically now too! Professor Jiller (i think anyway) That's what it sounded like on the machine.  I'm so happy in my new major, and really excited to take all these classes i have to take.

Not only that, but the jazz band concert date, he told me he was working, but would try to get it off or trade. and he'd make sure to get off the 2 november Concert dates. Yea, he's never done that for a concert here before. He also bought me Blue Jackets tickets for opening night. There's the Italy trip too don't forget. 
The weird thing about this is...everything is kinda close together. Blue Jackets game on 10/10 in Columbus. 8 days later is Parents Weekend & there's PoD in concert. Exactly 1 week after that is my Jazz concert. The next one isn't for a month after that..nov. 17th is choral union (sunday) and EHS is the 23rd...the saturday after. THen I'm home 3 days later for thanksgiving.

Mom...bought me a suit & a ""leather"" jacket this weekend with money she really should be putting on the house, and she's gonna buy me whatever bed I want for my room at her house. 

does anyone else see the spoiling? 

I think they're just trying to win me over, because I think they caught on about me being unhappy about the seperation. Ya know, I'm still unhappy, but i LOVE every bit of it ;) LOL"

Saturday was the UD vs. Duquesne game. UGH....DU won...It was a good game though, it wasn't one of those 'yep the flyers got it' games.  That night was a pimps & hoes party at 110 Lawnview. I went as cheap ho....tube top, jeans, platform sandals,many mardi gras beads...and to top it off....a trojan in the pocket. I saw ZZ, and he said we have to talk. I promise I'll get ya caught up on my life story. LOL! 

Sunday comes.....and a hungover me goes to the noon mass to play & help Brian out. Aren't I great? Mass went great...I couldn't have played better even if I practiced. Then mommy & little sis came over and we did a little shopping and bought me a suit, and I conned her out of a leather jacket. *grin* After that was dinner....yum...came back & tried to straighten up my room...cause she brought me more clothes than I have room for!! Next....10pm mass, and I swear...I was the WORST trumpet player to live. What in the world happened from noon to 10???? maybe I just play better hungover ;) LOL I had to play old cruddy marching/.pep band trumpet this week too...grr...cause I go to Reichard to get my pretty baby (the good trumpet) and my locker is locked. ....and stupid betsy doesn't remember her combo.

"event","Ya know, everyone has experianced some bad timing sometime, right? Man, let me tell you about the bad timing that I had yesterday. I was sitting here feeling fat, again, (what else is new eh?) and...finally I got over it, and my roommate Kasey had mint chocolate chip ice cream....my fave. Pints were buy 1 get 1 free at UDF. I was just about to message Katie to ask her if she wanted to go get some, when she walked into my room wearing her little skinny ass jeans, and a shirt that has only 3 buttons & showed off her belly as she says ""you think i should get my belly button peirced?"" For some reason I just felt horrible again. I dunno what could have done that./.....*shrugs* now THAT is bad timing. 

Lets see what else is going on....
oh yea....how come everyone in this house is getting visitors but me?? also not fair.  I do know however where to get sex when I go home again. So...at least I can get that taken care of...no strings attached. 

another interesting thing....I've kinda taken charge of putting together a campus girl scout group through buckeye trails council here at UD. I don't know how this is going to work, but, hopefully it will. I have to meet with the girl from the council to get things started, and then I'll go talk to the poeple on campus. I hope this works ok.

anywya, I'm out. I have shit to get done. SEE YA!"

we left early in the am on friday, and stopped in louisville, KY for lunch....on the road again....to clarksville....shower.....to nashville. The grand Ole Opry was one of the options & there was the mall & the opry land hotel. Fun stuff. I did mall & looked at the opry land hotel. back to clarksville....bed. 

wake up....rehersal @ austin peay.....lunch.....game (kicked the Peay's ass big time)...hotel.....dinner....downtown nashville.

about downtown nashville. I figured out how country I really was. I'm scared. I bought a cowboy hat down there & wore it around town. (its white, the only size 7 i could find. cute YAY) and I guess I really fit in, cause a couple people didn't believe I was from Ohio. Ah well. And we went & sat in this little 'bar' and the band playing there did a couple real country songs.....which i knew. there wasn't a bar around there that I didn't know the song playing. I'm sooooo scared. WHen you fit in to Nashville, you're country. *screams*

back to hotel....drink...Jessie/Brian vs. Jordan....flyerette skit/initiation....drink more....sleep...wake up....leave.....lunch in louisville....home. 

exciting eh? HAHAH! I'll try to add more later, but right now itr's sleep time. NIGHTY!"

"event","It's been sooo great around here yes? kinda.
this past weekend was the first home football game. WHOOO GO FLYERS! Yea, we won, and the Pride pulled off a wonderful performance. We got an ovation from the crowd when we did the chorus of AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL and some people were moved to tears. It was a good performance, but could have been better. My daddy came to see the game &* tape the game, and then he gave me $$ and took me to eat. YAY for parents when they do this... Also visiting was Meghan & her friend Laura. YAY fun timed too. We chilled at the house & drank & had a great time all weekend. 
Also this week was SAI formal rush on tuesday! YAY!!! I GOT A LITTLE! I got such an awsome Little...Chris Bauer. I'm so excited that I finally got a little who will stick around ;)

Despite all that good, it still seems like the week that won't die. Its seemed to go on forever, and I've done things all week. Well, prolly cause I have. But, it's just going so slow. hopefully that'll all end with the PoD trip to Nashville this weekend. I can get away from classes, and away from the house for a while. I'll get to spend more quality time with people I don't usually get to spend a lot of time with. It's gonna be great, and the housemates can have a quiet weekend. All I hope is that while I'm on my enjoyable trip, my mom doesn't call. that woman gets on my nerves sooo much about her new house, and sayin she'll give me a little money, and doesnt. SHe keeps taking emily shopping. Am I missing something here? am I doing something wrong?  Dad's shoveling out all the money he can spare to me to pay for the Italy trip, and so I have a little money for the nashville trip, and he's paying for school....*shrugs* I think I'm just in the wrong family, the wrong school...something. Maybe I should sell my bach strad to get some more money. I love it to death, but I guess I can live without it."

"event","I can't believe it is already Sept. 11 once again, One year ago, out country fell to its knees in prayer & raged in patriotism. Where were you? I remember everything about the day last year, so fresh in my mind. There's no doubt that when my kids ask me where I was, I can tell them everything: where I was, who i was with, and what I felt.

Today I was up in enough time to see the sunrise (yea, 6:15am) and I thought to myself how many people didn't get to see Sept. 12, 2001. I right then thanked God for another day to live. Eventhough I am going through rough times, I've still got life. 

The next thing on my mind today was Duncan. I don't really know how today would have been if I hadn't have gotten to talk to him last night. I think it was perfect timing. 

Seeing my friends today too was something to be thankful for. I don't know what I'd do without them.

TOday in PoD before we started rehersal, we had a long discussion about last year, and everyone's feelings & thoguhts. Come to find out, Prof. Caldwell lost someone in the Pentegon Attack. We talked about family, and how the Pride is a big family. I see it as not just a family, but a gift. They are truely my support, and I know at least 1 person is looking after me at all times. 

The vigil outside in humanities was awsome. A candle for everyone who lost their lives last year were given out to everyone, and lit at the appropriate time. I was singing, so I was in front of the crowd. Everyone came together.....it was kinda like world youth day all over again, only 100 times smaller. But nevertheless, so moving & emotional. I cried. 
I'll never forget this day, last year, or years to come. 


Lord, make me a channel of your peace....."

I came back in from trumpet sectional at like 10 after 9, and katie comes running out to me telling me she has duncan talking, and that he wanted to talk to me. I guess my face went blank. I go to her computer, and tell him its me.....nad oter than that...i didn't know what else to say. I didn't know what to say. Where did he go? Ireland. He said he just needed to go back home, and that he never meant to hurt me.... I didn't know what to say. I just sat there looking at what he would type, and come up with some 1 line thing to say...he said he's gonna get to Ohio soon, when he finds out what the navy is gonna do to him for just taking off. Where does this put us? not so right now.....but, we'll see. 

Anyway, i'm still speechelss. and i need to get to bed because i volunteered to sing at the 8am prayer service for Sept. 11th. g'night all."

"event","I'm so very glad I joined EHS this semester. Tonight in class we were singing and something just moved me. All the feelings I had in Canada all came back to me again. I'm so grateful to know that the Lord is still with me, and he has not abandon me as though it seems. It's rough times right now: the Duncan situation, and my parents moving...but the Lord must think that I'm strong to send me down this path. I know however that I'm not strong on my own. There's no way that I could make it through alone. My friends have played a big part in this, most importantly, my PoD family. If not for those people, I'd have no reason to do Pod, and it just serves as an activity where I can go to get away from things, but also know that I'm loved in some way by everyone there. The biggest help though, is my Lord and Savior. Without him, I would be nothing. I sing his praises for all my days, and especially now, when things are looking dark, I know I can find a leading light in Him until I get to the end of this road, and even far after. 

All praise to God our loving Father, and His Son, Jesus, to whom I give my heart and my hand to lead me down the rough path that leads to happiness and eternal life."

"event","It was quite an eventful weekend. We had a party here at 40 Chambers friday night. Quite interesting. Thanks peeps for showing up & drinking beer! Saturday I went home so mommy could fix my band pants & make them look half way decent at least, since I had them hemmed like SHIT ! Got that taken care of, bull shitted the rest of the day. Sunday....went to my family reunion, and saw soo many people that I haven't seen in quite a while. Everyone there expected me to still be like 7 or so too...so...it was a shock for all. I also talked to Clayton before I left to come back. It really didn't do me any good though, although at the time I thought it did. I came back, went to mass & played trumpet....it went ok I guess. I kinda had a playing block. *shrugs* i'll work on that. 

after mass on friday though, I talked to Krystal, and got a lot of details about Duncan's dissapearance than I got from Clayton...and things are seeming very shady. Krystal & I put things together that its 99% possible that DUncan just couldn't call me, because the phones were out...he could get calls, sometimes, but not call out. So, it could have just been bad lines that kept him from callign me. But his disapearance is still really shady. I found out his X-box is missing from his room, and he had taken it with him apperently to some guy's house to play. He & clayton were supposed to go to a movie that night, and duncan never called Clay. A couple days later, Clay said there were 2 guys that wern't from the boat in Duncan's room when he went in. Duncan's missing, his car is missing, and his X-box is missing. His computer is still in his room, and so are all of his clothes, which means he didn't plan on going anywhere for a long period of time, cause he takes his computer with him if he's gonna be gone for more than a day, and he would have taken clothes too if he planned on being gone for this long. 

I'm really scared that somethign horrible has happened to him. I am mad at him, but I still care about him, and i would be horribly torn up if something happened to him. If he turns up, and I talk to him, I'd give him a 2nd chance. But right now, I guess all I can do is hope and pray that he's safe somewhere, and that he's ok. If he is dead (which I hope not) I would want to know, because I want to pay my respects at the least. 

on a happier note, today the Pride (part of us anyway) did the Jerry Lewis Telethon. We donated a little over $600 from a group that's not even 100 people. isn't taht awsome!! I myself gave $20. It goes to MDA...which is a good cause anyway. GO PRIDE!!


anyway, I'm out for now,. I have some studying, some praying, and some sleeping to do! BYE@!"

"event","""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" that quote totally describes my day today. To start off, I didn't get up till 10....because my tuesdays & thursday's don't start till 1:30 in the afternoon, and even so, today I Wasn't going to class because PoD was performing in Cinci at a bengal's game. mucho fun! the bus ride was great....euchre games....but the top 2 parts of the night: the performance, and the massage from Gruden. (i'll talk about the performance, other is self explainatory) Here we are on the field, and it comes time to line up in the endzones, and get ready for the run on. Adrinaline pumping....GO! the performance was awsome in every way possible (and i was on the jumbotron! YES!) the bus ride back was very UDish in the fact that we sang our sonfgs, said our limericks, and all taht stuff. Always a great time. I get home (After chillin for a while,and talking to gruden) and I go downstairs to katie's room. I look online  see DuncanM757. Ahhh....Duncan's name...so, rather than leave a short message and hope he'll reply, i typed a long ass bitching.....i typed till it wouldn't let me type any more characters, and then some. i get a response: ""this is clayton, not duncan. he's been missing for a week"" clayton also told me to message him on his name & i did.... and we chatted. It does make me feel somewhat better that clayton also let him know that he was upset at what he done to me. I feel really horrible now. Clayton said  that he's been missing for a week, his car is gone & nobody has seen him. To lighten things up, i mentioned if they find the car i want it...but....he's like..""i'm serious. there's a good possibliity he could be dead"" If you've seen my away message for the apst few days, I've been wishing death upon him by mulling by sharks....i dind't mean it honest! As much as i'm mad at him, and upset, if anything happen to him, I'd be so torn up. Clayton is coming home thsi weekend, and I'm gonna go home saturday to sunday.....he said he'd call me &  we'd talk.....cause he wants to tell me his side of the story. And another thing, they know Duncan didn't just LEAVE cause a) he'd be going AWOL...and b) all his stuff, including his computer, is still in his room. Clay said he's been staying in his room for a while, and he hasn't come back. So.....I dunno about this. I do feel better, cause clayton said he is mad about what D did to me too.....but at the same time I feel so horrible to think of the fact that something happened to D. Someone help me......what's going on with me lately? What kind of test is this!?"

"event","1 in the morning, and I'm wide awake..my mind is full of disturbing thoughts and memories of the past..I hate relfecting on things behind me,I try not to dwell on anything, but in the end I do so all is useless. As far as my life goes I'm surviving and my nervous breakdowns are slowly dissapearing, and I'm overcoming things that keep me down. I'm suffering from one of the most horrible writers block I've had in ages, not like writing is something I do extremely well, so I guess it doesn't matter in the end. I found my puppy book of poetry (that's what I called it so cram it, screwball) and since you all love me so much I'm going to post the ONE good one in there (The rest kinda suck). So yes, here it is, and a song by mariah carey that I adore.

Best Friends Forever you said
Strange how three words can hurt so bad
Forever Friends we were meant to be
But, one person didn't agree.
They took you away from me.
Now I cry alone at night
but, you  are nowhere in sight
Despite our sorrow there's always tomorrow
Days start and days end
Even though were far apart
You'll stay forever in my heart
We may never see each other again
But you'll still be my..
Best Friend

<font color=00BFFF>
Many nights we pray
With no proof anyone could hear
And our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we know we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
And now I am standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near

There can be miracles (miracles)
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
You will when you believe
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will when you believe

Storm grey eyes lifted to the sky as the moon broke through the clouds casting it's eerie glow and the couple below. The bigger of the two stepped from the alley, the moon swallowing him in light. He was tall, and well built. Raven black hair fell to his shoulders, he would have been handsome if black and white paint didn't hid his face. 
Pushing back his hair his eyes swept down the empty streets, turning around he looked at the other figure still lurking in the shadows, creeping away from the moonlight's gentle touch. Like him, she had raven black hair, and a nice figure. His eyes lingered on her a moment, pausing for a brief moment as he pushed his thoughts about her back. He whispered her name, the faintest of murmer escaping his lips as he crossed over, grabbing her shoulder and jerking her around to face him.

1-somebody obviously wants me alive
2-I'm going to die sooner or later
3- stupid goal in life


Happy Thanksgiving to all of those who celebrate it. Now, time for my shit.




<font color=CC99FF> <i> 

Confusion,
Illusion,
Tricks of the mind,
Nowhere to run..
There's no place to hide
Nobody to help me..
Nobody to care
Wherever I turn
Nobodies there
Lost,
Confused,
What am I supposed to do?
Do I stay hidden by myself?
Locked away with my depression?
Do I take the knife..
And fly with suicide?
I've no reason to live
I'm numb on the inside
I've fallen
My walls are closing in
There's no end..
It's time to give in..

I wrote that around 4 last night..so it doesn't make any sense, oh well.

The mountain tops caped with snow

The journey you had

catch your breath hit the wall
scream out loud as you start to crawl
back in your cage the only place
where they will leave you alone

'cause the weak will seek the weaker
til they've broken them
could you get it back again
would it be the same

fulfillment to their lack of strength
at your expense
left you with no defense
they tore it down

and I have felt the same as you
I've felt the same as you
I've felt the same

locked inside the only place
where you feel sheltered where you feel safe
you lost yourself in your search
to find something else to hide behind

the fearful always preyed upon your confidence
did they see the consequence they pushed you around
the arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones
breaking them 'til they've become just another crown

and I have felt the same as you
I've felt the same as you
I've felt the same as you
I've felt the same

refuse to feel, anything at all
refuse to slip, refuse to fall
can't be weak, can't stand still
you watch your back 'cause no one will

you don't know why they had to go this far
traded your worth for these scars for your only company
don't believe the lies that they have told to you
not one word was true

you're alright
you're alright
you're alright

It rips apart your heart and soul,

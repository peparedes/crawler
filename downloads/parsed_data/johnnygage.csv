Where to start.....My foot is killing me and I'm draggin'. Maybe I should go to CVS and get some Dr. Scholls. Then I'd be jellin' like a smellin' felon. Shit. What the hell am I talking about. Brett is outside riding her bike and the dog is following her around. What a pair. Anyway, work is good. It feels good to be the focal point of a company again. The system was pretty simple to pick up and the work is easy. Little to no stress and Wayne is a good guy to work for. He doesn't come peeking over my shoulder to see what I'm doing. He lets me get my work done and that's great. Okay, enough about that.

The Sox have a shot at making the playoffs this year. Four games out of first and tied with the Mariners for the wild card. Now, if they only had a bullpen. Football season starts next Thursady and I think I drafted myself a pretty good football team in the Tundra. I'm going to see if I can steal Randy Moss from Ken. It's worth a try. The Pats are looking good this year and I think they have a more than decent shot at the playoffs. The Vikes. Well, we'll see.

Brett's birthday party is this weekend. It should be fun. She is all excited. It's a busy week for her. She started school yesterday and she loves it. Her after school outfit has to go though. Short skirts and boots. Uh-uh. Ain't gonna fly here. She's s great little kid. We played football on Saturday. It was fun. I was the Patroits and she was the Buffaloes. I don't even know who won, but it doesn't matter. It was fun. Then we played the scoop game, but it was so damned windy, the ball just kept floating. But we laughed and had a great time. I just wish I had more time to play with her. I guess, if I think about it, there's plenty of time. I just have to find it. 

I saw one of the coolest things the other day. I was driving to work, stopped at a stop light, and I saw some lady getting ready to cross the street. Before she did, she stopped next to a stone wall, smelled the flowers, and crossed the street. That kind of puts things in a different light. It's like the other day I was in the garden and I was just watching the bees flying in the flowers and I was totally content. Maybe I'm getting old or maybe I'm just taking time to understand things better. It's amazing if you just sit back, look at the world around you, don't make a sound, and marvel at how much you've been missing. The insects, the birds, the wind blowing through the trees and plants. It's all pretty friggin' cool when you think about it. 

I'll end this with a little bit of irony. A fable, if you will. I was driving to work Tuesday, I think, and I went the wrong way. I went straight instead of left. So, in retrospect, I went down the wrong path and I hit a bird. Killed the little sucker. I felt wicked bad and then I figured out I was going the wrong way. If I had taken the left, the right path, I never would have killed the bird. Pretty freaky, huh? 

Well, I have to go tighten up the screws on the ceiling fan and get the fan running because the neighbors are smoking weed and I can't stand the smell. I had so much more I wanted to write, but I can't think of it right now. Oh yeah, we went to see Freaky Friday. It was great. I laughed my ass off. Oh yeah, and I saw Chicago on DVD. It was great! I loved it! Eben though Tom was against it and boycotted Hollywood because of it, they stuck right to the play. Other than Richard Gere lipsyncing all the songs, it was a fun movie. Well, gotta go. Comfy clothes are calling my name. T.T.F.N."

Damn song's been running around in my head for weeks. 

<b> I HAVE A JOB!!!!!!!!!</b> I was hired by Dakota systems in Dracut and I start on Monday. YAY!

My brain is finally recovering from camp. I had a blast. I had a chance to hang out with my friends, shoot the shit, and goof around. Isn't that what camp is all about. Fucking John Carter kicked my ass in the cribbage tournament. I have played him twice in 3 years and he has pummeled me both times. I don't know what it is. Maybe he is my arch cribbage nemesis. It is my goal in life to defeat John Carter in cribbage. Yes! Beat John Carter. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.......... Yes, I have lost my mind. John is a good friend, so I can deal with the defeat. Also at camp, I climbed a 35' rock wall. I was a little nervous when I started, but once I got on that wall I just couldn't stop until I reached the top. I DID! I MADE IT!

Well, I have to run out real quick. I hope to finish this up later."

"event","Here I am again. searching for jobs and trying to figure out how to survive. Yesterday was rough. I was just friggin' miserable. Frustrated and disappointed. I started thinking. Is pride a dying human attribute? Society has taken a lot of what we were brought up to believe would get us through and basically crapped all over it. Pride is a dying species. Society has turned into a global Thunderdome where all the trechourous, lying, backstabbing pricks survive. No longer is a man's word his bond. No longer does a handshake seal the deal. No longer is respect important. What happened to the days when you called your neighbor Mr. or Mrs. When did it become acceptable for pre-teens to address adults by their firt names? maybe I'm too old school or maybe I was brought up with values and dare I say PRIDE. Respect? Whatever. Who the fuck really cares anymore. I'm trying to survive the day, apply for jobs, and just keep myself sane. I have a father in law who sounds like he's coughing up a lung every morning, but refuses to quit smoking. That whole situation is a friggin' mess in itself. Oh well.
      Good news yesterday. My game was cancelled. Yay! Stayed home and jumped in the pool with Lisa and Brett. Today looks iffy though as storms sit on the horizon. It's 78 out with 75% humidity. Time to go. Regis and Kelly are coming on and I need to apply to another job. Hopefully something will come along soon."

     Well, here I am. Looks like rain outside, but who the hell really cares. I'm still unemployed and my severance pay is just about gone. I had hoped to find a job by now, but the job market sucks. Oh well.
     Yesterday was a good day. Umpired, AGAIN. It was a good game until the last inning and then the coaches get all huffy over close calls and balls and strikes. They are 8 year old kids, you friggin' idiots! Have you no brains. I have another game tonight, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Day off Friday. Hooray! But I need the money. Anyway, back to the weekend. After the game we hung around for awhile then Lisa, Brett, Jessica, and I all went to Canobie Lake for 5:00 and we stayed until just about 10. Brett is now tall enough to ride all the rides. She rode the corkscrew rollercoaster twice. The swings and everything else she could get on. She was thrilled! We slept in today. Johnny forgot to put the gate at the bottom of the stairs when he let Buster out and he was nice enough to wake us up at quarter to 7. I sent him back downstairs and went back to sleep until 9. That'll fix 'em. That's about it. Other than that, the weekend was nothing special. 
      It still looks like rain. I may go out and mow the lawn today, but I don't know. Johnny is off to his father-in-laws to help him paint. What a fuckin' mess that situation is. Well, gotta go. Things to pretend to do."

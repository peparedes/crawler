At Acen...staffers from other conventions sort of congregated in a aisle in the dealers room. We talked, Laughed and swapped stories for almost 2 hours. NOW...I'm thinking that this was a great way for us to comiserate and to network. You never know who has a fog machine until you start gabbing about this or that. SO...I was thinking..really I have been for the last few years that there should be a party just for con staff...no matter what con they worked on. All they need is a staff badge from another con...no matter the year and they are in like Flynn.

It was nice to stand in an aisle ...imagine what that could be like in a room where no one can hear us..or even better..where we could hear each other. Not a meeting..but a party....for Ohaycon Staff as well as staff from all over.

Sounds like fun to me.

But I would like to know if others think so too...lol. I just want make sure that the exspense of the room use and other stuff that must accompany said party is worth it."

"event","SO......I was reminded that I had neglected the convention for far too long. Things had to be done..and really now is the time to do them. SO...I have been working on the con....all day..from the moment I woke up..and I will continue while the mood has moved me.

I miss Jeff...alot at this time..this was the time we would sit on the phone and just work..and talk when we had a comment. Like AIM..but on the phone. We wouldn't talk for hours..then take a break..and chat. It started on aim...then we got tired of typing and he got tired of watching me mispell stuff.

Things I worked on Today...

Signed up on the Ohayocon.org forums...

Laughed until I cried when I read that stuffon the Ohaycon.com forum..really that shit is funny.

Actually installed AIM on my sisters machine as mine is still pooka.

I called people who were staffers and asked them to come to the con.

worked out rooms for staff with Dusti..

Confirmed Greggo...who will be coming and doing his kick ass game shows...Two on Saturday and on on Sunday.

WOrked on the event spaces names andstuff...and what they will be called..this is never easy.

Sent things to Jack so he can make his super uber special super sekret thing..he's working on.....

Worked on the design for the largest schedule in the con circuit...

Last year on Sunday on a whim I put the schedule on the wall...it was easier to read for everyone...so...I'll do all three days this year...using painters tape and double sided heavy stock paper with the names of the panels on it.

Talked to the parties needed on having a band provide music for our super cute formal dance on Sat night...a Winters Fantasy...or the Snowball..or something equally as cute and wintery...This will give me the chance of wearing one of my super fun dresses I haven't worn in a while...yay!

Talked to my set designer on the set trappings needed to make such an event magicalness...

Talked to Dusti about getting it catered...and charging 5 a couple for appetizers and soda and then a little to pay the band.

Talked to Gavvigan...and confirmed..anime hell..it's not a con if there's no hell in it....really.

Worked on the Friday/Sat Schedule..Planning on a catered dinner for guests and staff thing at 4-5 and then after dinner cocktails for the guests or a break from 5-6....the Roast is at 6-8 Break for all then off to the concert...

Not too sure on dinner times...but eating must be had..and really...i'll find the time or make the time.

I talked to more people today than I have all year long. It was really hard for me to do it too. I'm glad I did..but I feel a bit like the upheavel depicted in Superman the movie when the Fortress of Solitude was built. All jagged and raw..and sharp too. Boo....

Brought back the idea of a conventionites only party.  This is for networking..andstuff..not sure when...but we need it baaad.

Talked to Sabat...secured Voice acting panel guy and a back rub...

There is alot to do still...I would like to talk to ....
Mike McFarland..

hmmm..there was more ..but I fogot....

Since I DL'd aim..if anyone wants to keep me company...
Lissa2712 is me..."

"event","So. Molly found her Llamas book..(YAY!!) it was lost for 6 months. She just didn't want to look for it..it's been that kind of a year. Honestly..I am not sure how I feel that its half over already. I don't know where it went.. I haven't watched it leave. I watched the clouds and the trees..and the rain. I watched Kate get taller..again. -_-..she's either taller than me now..or is the same height...height doesn't impress me..as I'm a scrapper.

The coincidence happens when I checked out two books from the library...one as a consolation for the book I was looking for ..and the other.at random. I do that..the subject appealed to me. It is based on the concept of Weight vs. Lightness .

1. It appeals to me cause Jack started a most fun game about vs. and I'm like that.
2. Because I have delved this subject before..of Parmenides who first described the worlds as having opposites..being made up of equal but opposite forces. Light/Dark, warmth/cold. That he attributed a positive and a negative label to these properties. Who can say what he said was correct..who exactly was he to decide which is positive and what negative.
3. That immediately it talked about the Idea NIetzche's eternal return.
4. I have felt heavy and wished to be rid of this ...I have felt that this pinning down from pining..was a burden..and ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" seemed to be the opposite of what I was feeling. Sometimes it's nice to see how the other half lives.

Here is where the coincedence comes in.

The book that i picked as a consolation also spoke of the positive negatie aspects of life..this was not what I was looking for. I am not sure what I was looking for ..but that was not it. The two books are polar opposits..neither positive nor negative..just opposite. I was looking for the fast silly read that makes you think...but not much. Like the money Coach Z has....1 2 1 2

I realized there was a third Coincidence...I saw Prof. Simkonis my MBA Economics teacher who first taught my the idea of eternal return. NOT my philosophy professor...

I adore Dr. Simkonis.. He helped me through the death of my mother...we cried together..when we found out he had cancer too..I saw him at Blockbuster..he looked really good. I just think the world of him...I didn't talk to him.  I think there is a force field of sadness around me and he doesn't need to be brought into that.  He should be happy..and healthy.  He would ask me how I was..and I'd cry.

These things are all connected...and not even subtley...it's not even hidden well. The book I had gotten ..wasn't even good even though it was quick.. it wasn't painless. I feel that she was truly a sad person..and the idea of the pairs came up in the strangest of places.

Also, we watched the Courtship of Eddies Father..the 1960's classic..they discussed this idea too. as an aside... I find it implausible that 2 weeks tops after planting his mother he's wanting his father to re marry.

I think this day has been interesting..and I wonder how this book turns out. The other book..silly and dour..all at the same time..took 2.5 hours to read..this one will take me a week to really read it. Hmmmm

24...I look forward to the day I stop counting."

I miss cleaning out the car and making Margret shiney and clean and ready to pick up our visitor.  I miss driving to the airport and waiting at the Delta Entrance. When it started I could meet him at the gate..then 9/11 and then I could meet him at the exit ramp...then life just gts more hectic..and I miss putting his things in my car.  Him getting out claire alittle stuffed tiger I bought him at a truck stop on the way home from a meeting in columbus and having the girls fake illness so they can try to go to the airport with me.  I miss knowing that he will have with him more hours of tape that I would ever watch...that he leaves stuff behind...cause I know he wanted to stay behind.  I miss the look on Molly's face when she got off hte bus and he was there..she was beyond happy.  I miss him making me garlic bread and food I don't normally eat and he always did...frankly its not good for you all the time.  Obviously..that stuff can lead to a heart attack.  I miss hearing him in the kitchen....cleaning my kitchen..ahh how I love that dish washing sound..when its not me doing it. LOL...I miss him at the other end of my phone.  I miss the look of interest Kate had when he talked.

But I know he's here with me..but still I miss the physical things.  I thought it would get easier..it has not.  I thought I would get better I have not..well not in the way I thought I would. 

I do not miss saying goodbye.  I hated it when he got on the plane..I liked planning for it..but I hated him leaving.  I hated knowing he would be sad someplace far away from me and I couldn't help him.  

I'm glad I had this expeirence but it's so bitter...bleah.

ooo ooo ooo ooo oooo burn the whole day..down.

SO..since my guild dissolved I weeded out the peeps and thinking about using it for being in touch with people.  Cause I think I need help in that respect.  It's not like I can expect someone to come down here and force me to do stuff anymore..  Ok...force is too strong..but suggest in a strong and authoritative manner.

My main problem is as a total newbie I am not really sure how the friends thing and your network works.  And I have envy of the backgrounds and whatnot. You look at some of them and they are like uber shiney..well I want mine blue and sparkly how do I do that.  I've had fun today just trying to figure it out.

"event","I have been a total shut in for the past few months.  I get up, get dressed..care for the girls and I go to the store..but as far as facing the world..I haven't been doing that so much.  Jen has been taking care of me ..so I have just been licking my wounds and trying to pull out of this bleah-ness.  

See..at Ohayocon right after the con..like on Monday we decided that we had to start going to cons to promote our con.  We had plateaued with the attendees that surround Colombus and we had to start pulling from other areas.  Jeff and I took MTAC.  It is sort of close..not to bad to go and meet attendees and let them know what we had to offer and we could see Em and Bob and Jan and Greg and have a good time with great people.  Well then Jeff moved to a place that won't allow two way travel and I am sitting here in Feb..wondering if I can get out of it..or maybe it's forgotten.  Dusti broached the subject again..a week ago..and I thought that would be ok..if I went...but I really didn't want to leave the house.  I was all about not leaving my comfort zone reveling in the shut-in ness that I had grown into.  Comfy warm and the same each day.  I agreed to go a week ago..but it was like ..um sure I will..might go. It turned out that the other person couldn't go and it's a long drive. So,I was like..well now I sort of have to go..I wouldn't want him to go down there alone.  Then it turned out that we were staying with friends I really needed hugs from..so it was a done deal and Dusti was successful in putting me in his car and taking me from being a shut=in to being a reluctant con attendee.  

I still hid..I really didn't want to talk to alot of people and some of the hardest moments I faced was talking to Kevin at the con..and talking around it..dancing around it..and still sharing those moments...without breaking down completely.  I was so glad to see him...I just wanted to cry..and for so many reasons too.

It was a good con though.  They over filled the event space with alot of people spending their weekend sitting in the lobby..having group discussions on their own.  I am pretty proud of the attendees at MTAC.  If I had to give them an award they would get it for being the ""best behaved"" of all of the cons this year.  No holes in the stair wells..nothing nasty on the walls..no spray paint..they even took the announcement that there would only be a two hour dance with some protest but no one was stoned to death.

MTAC Staff and Attendees were all very polite..I didn't get run over without an apology all weekend long.  I totally believe that staff..especially DH's Dress for the con..I wear business dress to casual while working a con..as a matter of professionalism with the hotel and the attendees.  These guys were like amazingly dressed.  Three peice suits,wing tips..like a GQ Magazine.  They were sharp.

I did sit at the Ohayocon table de schmooze on Friday..we were set up next to Red Octane and they had Guitar Hero set up for duel players with a really cool screen and projector.  Now if I pause for a second..I hear Iron Man, Smoke on the Water, I wanna be sedated, Killer Queen ..these are not the versions we know and love they are actually the songs ""as made famous by"" so not quite the song but enough like it to ruin it for me forever.  I know I have forgotten the name of 3 others ...but they rotate in a random fashion with a patter of Iron Man to 3 of the other songs..and then beginning again with Iron Man.

I defected to the Studio Capsule table to help sell hats..which might be my calling in life..I am great at selling stuff...I also talk alot....I really defected because it was farther away from the GH game and I didn't want to sit alone in the room..as I have that whole shut in thing I'm working on...and I wasn't interested in going to the con to be around people I didn't know..as I am still a mostly a shut in.  One of the pluses of selling hats..and something that made me a little sad is I got to do the exact change dance..

I managed to recruit staff..and talked to well over 100 people pimping Ohayocon..and all it's event filled game having, video watching goodness.
We actually had 5 Ohayocon Staffers at MTAC so we had a meeting..so we were even like three times as productive as usual. sweet.

I meet new people..Prince..who's real nema is Persian but sounded too much like my name and thus confused me..Marisha.(again..alot like Melissa), Anthony and Shawn.  They were a great bunch and I had a wonderful time talking to them about the reality of liking what a person does and how that really has little correlation with who they are inside. In talking to them about all sorts of things I managed to get a group..""yes we would be your staffers""..so that made me do a little dance of goodness inside.

I remet someone that I have had to meet before.  He's Bob's friend and I managed to recruit everyone but him..into being a staffer..but given time I am sure I could get him to come around..or at least do pre con stuff.

andstuff...

I realized that I missed my at con-family like I was starving.(maybe in a way I was)  I was surrounded by people I know are pulling for me,loving me..and surrounding me with love.   And I see I can't starve like that..I just wanted to steal everyone and take them home with me..I didn't want anyone to leave.  More so than normal con leaving.  I guess loss scares you into wanting nothing to leave.  I have to watch that..If I get clingy..bap me..or something.

ON Sunday night the room Dusti and I had smelled like sugar cookies in the strongest and right out of the oven way.  No one was in the room to the right and there was no room to the left.  It also seemed there was some mint in it too.  Maybe lemon peel..which it should have in it..I think.  our window seemed ot be the only one in the hotel that didn't open.  The windows at the hotel opened to the outside...I haven't seen that since Katsu#???in 2000..heck, I think they weld the windows shut if they know an anime con is coming. 

It was weird..cause it only happened when we were in the room alone.  When Bob and Em were in there it wasn't a Bakery..when they left..Bake-o-rama...bell hop in the am..no cookies..he leaves and it's sugar cookie central.

I was so sleepy on the way back to my house ..I would fall asleep and didn't know I was asleep sleep.  So in the end not really all that helpful with the wingman position for Dusti.  He is so totally awesome..I would never have left the house if he hadn't helped me get the heck off my butt and do someting anything..even if it was wrong.  It wasn't...but you know what I mean I think.  
Dusti rocks out with his pocky out."

I bring to you..amazement!! Absolute amazement..the silver lining here is at least people are talking and trying to monitor this mess.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050913/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/katrina_contracts


Among the most controversial Katrina awards is one that the Homeland Security team cannot investigate: a $16.6 million contract with Kellogg, Brown & Root Services Inc. of Arlington, Va., for emergency repairs at Gulf Coast naval and Marine facilities. The money is part of a $500 million Navy contract that KBR won by competitive bid last July.

Because the     Pentagon awarded the KBR contract, Homeland Security has no authority to audit it. But KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton Co., has been at the center of scrutiny for receiving a five-year, no-bid contract to restore Iraqi oil fields shortly before the war began in 2003. Vice President     Dick Cheney headed Halliburton from 1995 to 2000, and Democrats have questioned whether the company has gotten favorable treatment because of his connection."

"event","I can't think of a cool title..I mean..I am not really good at that kind of thing.  The Super Sekrit Dance for Ohayocon2005 is a perfect example of my trying make a name for something on the spur of the moment.  Some liked it..I look at that and go.  It could have been so much better.

Ok..enough of that...
I am working, and I love my job, and the flexibility they offer...and I do like my job..although it's not flashy like sparkles on the water.  I design and recreate forms using Adobe Designer..so that that people can fill them out online or when sent them and just sent them back.  Not exciting ..I admit..but fun in a way.

I am really excited about my team!! GO TEAM GO! Last Thursday we as a group skipped work and went to the Reds Game...It was my first trip to our Ballpark..and the first time at a professional team event.  It was a good way to see the team in action...and how they relate to each other..and where I fit in..and I think I do..in a way.  They wanted me to drink and I Had a flash back to Acen 2002 with me asking people if they new my name..I passed on the drink.

Had a strange moment today, a group of people came from Boston to discuss what I could do and how I can do that thing for lots of other groups for a good long time.  I am not really sure what they expect me to do...as they weren't actually talking to me about it..but talking about me to my bosses boss and they were about 25 feet away.  

It was surreal...and scary all at the same time.

I am learning to dislike Word..it's great for typing but don't even think about moving something around...oh no...it's like ..umm no you didn't just do that..HAH! I'm gonna freeze your computer now.

my school is still up in the air...and class started last night...I can't do so much or I get visions of last year dancing in my head...bleah"

Favorite song..I think is..a tie..between: Ask ..and Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now...

Ask
Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to


So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY ""NO"" - HOW COULD I ?


Coyness is nice, and
Coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in
Life you'd like to


So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY ""NO"" - HOW COULD I ?

Spending warm Summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg


ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME


Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together


Nature is a language - can't you read ?
Nature is a language - can't you read ?

ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME


Because if it's not Love

That will bring us together


If it's not Love

SO ... ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
Oh, la ... 


Or...this one..which seemed to explain my job I no longer have at Sterling medical..
These are the lyrics to Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now...
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now

I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now


In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die ?


Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now


I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die ?


What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed


""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I (naturally) fled


In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye ?


I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now


""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I (naturally) fled


In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die ?"

"event","So, I was coming into work this morning and holding lots of stuff in one hand while trying to open the door with me super secret special card with the other hand.  It was impossible..and I spilt coffee all over me.  Bleah.  But ..it was funny cause when I went to get into my section with my card again..this guy behind me was like we'll it still doesn't like you..and I was like.. yeah it's mean to me.  He was like..well I have had to get 4 new ones since I have worked here..sometimes they just don't work.  SO, I say..I should go to the security people and tell them they have to get me a new one unless they want to escort me around all day.  But this is the best part...he said..umm I can't do that...  His face turned beet red and was so embarrased!!! I laughed and told him..that I didn't want him to escort me..but the security people..LOLOLOL

He was like oh yeah..and I have to say that was funny..LOLOL  I have seen him like 6 times today..so odd.  I don't know him..and I don't want him to follow me about."

"event","I have heard..and read somethings that have been said about me umm in January..and WOW! Now that's talking con-trash!! I have to give these people the trash talking nonsense prize of the year.  It was like angry con peeps talking in authentic con gibberish.  At first, I was like this stuff is so outrageous that I can't even talk about it.  It just made no sense..it was like stuff from Mars only with me as the central antagonist character...and as a Lilliputian.  It made no sense at all.  

It had the interesting points to be some true..of about 20% and then 80% complete crap.  I am a female, I have kids...I have worked for alot of conventions..the rest was crap.

To put it in perspective the people that were doing the writing cannot be vilified by me...I mean they do plenty on their own without any help at all from me.  But, I will say the slander was palpable..and WOW was it amazingly wrong and off center.  They were angry and angry people say things that express that.  Of course, the fact that what was being said sounded like they were also on crack..well..perhaps that helped them feel better..and helped them deal with the anger issues they were obviously having.  

The ""they"" at this point is not really important..what is important is that con circles now are like a horrible backstabbing circle jerk..only with knives and no lube.  And that people who really do harm..well, they are left to their own devices to steal, mis-budget and manage thier departments into the ground.

Here are Eleven completely..amazingly random things I would like to just say:
1. Some people should not try to be spys and then tell peeps you're gonna be a spy.  Duh! 
2. You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  If you weren't there...don't talk about events like you were.  It makes you look like an ass.  
3. Some people bring in their friends or really business partners..and give them equipment that they use for their yearly business..just to have them set up each year.  This equipment which if actually belonged to the convention could be written off as a capital improvement and depreciated to provide tax savings.
4. (Lesson Learned)If you work with a con..make sure you have a contract for all equipment you give to someone else that ties the person to your con..word of mouth and a hand shake don't cut it.  
5. Some people ..should read more books on business law. 
6. When you get really mad at someone and you feel the need to talk trash..call your friends on the phone.
7. Take responsibility for your failings and then improve on that. To stick your head in the sand and pretend it wasn't your fault, just creates that: suck, pretend it wasn't you and repeat cycle. 
8. If you are angry, that should be aimed at the person who deserves it..not at relatives or friends of that person.  ESPECIALLY SMALL ONES.  Of all of the crap, what really made me angry was this.  The rest is laughable and perplexing.  However, the best way to make a momma lion mad is to mess with the cubs.
9. Be circumspect when in a meeting and not let the hate and anger catch you up in the horrible-ness..so that you too become horrible even if it's just for that moment.  
10. If there is that much hate and anger springing from people nothing really good can be born from it.
11. Some people really stink at stuff and I just have to wonder how you fool others. 

I think that is it...of my completely random and amazingly off the wall comments...andstuff.

Also, give me a call if you want to talk about this..LOL"

"event","To me..your amy is a direct extension of the values and decisions made by an administration.  When they split apart their is usually a military coup.  When the armed forces have differing veiws than the governing body..there is a split.  And there is more to what happened at Abu Graib...those people that went to jail..were patsy's and nothing more.  The lowest guy on the chain of command that gets the shaft..where the squeaky wheel gets the grease..the last guy on the chain of command gets his or hers asses handed to them.  And that is what happend..and there is more..and it makes me physically sick.  Sick that it happened..and sick that we didn't really know about it...so when more attacks happened we are all like going wtf? well some people know in the US....and apperantly everyone in Iraq knows..and if it were me..if this were my children...well I am not sure what I would do..about this treatment..

"event","So.....I have felt the need in the last few months that since my College life is coming to an end..I needed to have something to do..or I would go insane.  I always have something going.  I am either working on a con or helping with Kate or Molly's  school, doing homework, meeting with groups...and going to work.  All of these things make my pneumonia not so suprising.  Well..since my school part is ending..I thought it was time to work on my career life.  So since I have been pimping myself out for my resumer since 99' I figured with my almost degree and the stuff I have been accomplishing..it was really time.  So I started my looking for a job life.  I seem to do this every summer...well..its that feeling of not being doing andstuff.  So..I go on my search for a job...started with my resume..which kicks ass and is pretty amazing!! If I do say so myself.  Well I had lots of weird experiences going for interviews...none of them by the book..really.  I think that book must be on crack..since I had well 8 and none of them followed the book.  This book being ...Interviews for Dummies...cause I am one..and what better way to find out stuff than to read a book completely written with me in mind.  

<lj-cut text=""Job Search-o-rama"">

Ok...so in the end I went to two really important interviews..One with Fidelity on Thursday a few weeks ago..this was to be a part time PM job that had amazing pay..and it was what I went to school for.....this one had me completely stoked!   Then one the day after with Sterling Medical as a scheduler.  This is interesting..cause I was really wanting to not go to this one ..that they would say at Fidelity that they completely needed me..and I was hired.  

So Thursday came..I went to Fidelity and met with my contact there....but during this interview I told him that I had started to change over his form in Acrobat and he said ..after a lightbulb came from no where to sit just above his head...Eureka! I have someone that should meet you..will you be available after this interview...I was like..umm ..sure?  So I went to the interview..wowed him over..he liked me ..did the manager for the entire PM dept. but...I left there with a smile and went to another interview...Met Connie..who was UBER FUN!!! she was like ..sunshine ...to the other managers big inky blackness...  she is very upbeat and positive..and well sort of like me..andstuff only completely different.  We laughed through the interview..and good times were had by me..and her too cause at the end she was like.  No matter what they do over there..I still want you here.  It to was part time...and well with two part time positions..paying the amount they were offering..It would be better than a full time position..more flexible and the money is like amazing.  But I guess that is what I went to school for.  In the end..the PM guy didn't want to spend the money..even though he let me know ..I was the best person for the job...shallow comfort.

Friday dawned bright and early but the interview was set for 5:00pm...this is strange btw.  So I go...I am flexible...hell I am so freakin' flexible I felt like an Olympic Gymnast...I arrived on time...I also sat for an hour while they took thier sweet time...5:30 came and went..and at 5:45 finally someone came out and was like..well Karen can't make it..I am Rich and I will interview you in her place.  SO....he said..would you like something to drink...I said..sure..coffee.  He said we don't have any..lets goto Starbucks...So..off we went to starbucks..again..I am flexibile...this is what I am thinking..and we ended up eating at a Vietnamese Restaurant...and talking..chatting...and having a good time,but not really interviewing.  So in the end..he lets me know he owns the company..and stuff...and I am just what they need at his company.  Interesting...weird..really weird.  This was the Friday of Ikasu..  So...they didn't call, they didn't send flowers and there was no lets just be friends either.  So...I was jilted.  Connie called and started the hirhing process and I went with it.  On Tuesday I was filling out paper work at Fidelity...and guess who called when I got home...

Of course...Sterling.  So Kelly begged me to come in ...for another interview..but I was hostile and she sounded teary..and I went.  Tears work on me...usually.  And if they appear to not work...it's cause I get all upset that I get upset...at tears.  So I went..and met Brandon..and let him know that when I was jilted I moved on.  After HOURS of talking ..and really him selling me his company...again..another owner.  (It's a family owned buisness with 1800 employees) Well...I pushed for flexibility.  I Have been asked by them to be uber flexible with my time through this whole process ...and I want the same back.  I want to be able to work from home if someone is sick..or if I am( thinking of pnuemonia....) and I really need them to understand that what Fidelity offered was flextime they were not initially interested in offering me.  SO...it's in my contract..and as one is full and one part time...well i picked the full time.  NOW..I still have the job at fidelity..and will work there no more than 10 hours a week...just cause..there is no way I can do so much.  Even I see that....

NOw..Connie let me know today that she was trying to get me permanent cause we have a good time..and I can really find my way around programs..it's part of my geek side..I have one..oh yes..and it's MASSIVE.  So....she is trying to get them to hire me...and so then I have yet another choice..but this job is amazingly boring..and though she is great...it would be another tought choice...and a re evaluation in what i want in a job..versus I just wanted a job.

Well .....off to bed...I want to go in and work on those things..in the am...and try to get as much done as possible...cause when I start my other job...I most likely wont go in alot.  I can't believe this project went from the propossed 67 forms with a deadline of Jan...to well...14,000 forms..and more coming in everyday...they need an army of me to do this conversion...wow."

"event","Like the neon signs on the strip that spout about girls andstuff..I have been hounding the (job)boards and tracking down a position..and it has been tough.  This is only my 3rd week really looking for a job..with an A+ resume..if I do say so myself...and today I had an interview for one position and right after I left that one I went to another...and she was so much fun..it made me wish that the bosses had been switched.  

But I am tired..as its been this last few weeks..I work on my resume and spiel and call companies and get my name and face in front of those that need to see it to hire it,.....and man is it draining....

I also need a new outfit to wear at interviews..this melissa goes to interview outfit is a bit stale now .....I even think I look good in it..it's just...if they see me in the same outfit..it's not so good.

One of the weirdest things that has happened lately is that while at an interview the person interviewing me actually said he would be a netowrk contact for me with another company.  I wasn't a good fit for his position..honestly the position I was applying for is way more than this one was ...but still...it's confusing...for I am @_@"

"event","I was going to post this huge post about how I have been busy applying for jobs and perfecting my interview ...and shmoozing ..and working my contacts so that when I go to interviews I know their names..and have talked to them already.  But instead I think you all would rather hear about me getting a tan..and playing with my girls...and having a great time playing hookie from school this summer.  I am btw.  Sadly..I have forgone cash for time..and as such..have no disposable income to to anything with.  Instead we are having free or mostly free fun and enjoying the outside.  *GASP*  Also, we have been playing neopets...so go us.  Really I spend the early parts of the day ...applying ..and setting up interviews..and the second as a beach bum or reading books from the library up the street.  It's a wonderful place..and it's fun too.  YAY! ...

Since i posted I went to spend the weekend at Amy's house in Cleveland..and we had tons of fun ..enjoying lovely mudslides and watching movies..but it reafirmed my love for my air conditioner...so..when you come here ..bring a jacket..and skis..cause it's COLD in this house..mostly..ok it's around 76 but that is like paradise...trust me."

I was reading this ...http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20050420023309990015 article on Tom Delay..and as he singles out judges and says crap like ''The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior,'' I just have to wonder what friggen planet is he on..he wants to remove the check from the check and balance...and that is messed up.  He talks about activism against the Constitution ..but isn't attacking one of the three branches of government activism..he is a terror even if you can't call him a terrorist.

bleah on you MR. Tom Delay..no cookies for you."

""Red Rain""-Peter Gabriel
red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
I cannot make a single sound as you scream
it can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch
this place is so quiet, sensing that storm

red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town
they tell you that this rain can sting, and look down
there is no blood around see no sign of pain
hay ay ay no pain
seeing no red at all, see no rain

red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me

red rain-
putting the pressure on much harder now
to return again and again
just let the red rain splash you
let the rain fall on your skin
I come to you defences down
with the trust of a child

red rain is coming down
red rain
red rain is pouring down
pouring down all over me
and I can't watch any more
no more denial
it's so hard to lay down in all of this
red rain is coming down
red rain is pouring down
red rain is coming down all over me
I see it
red rain is coming down
red rain is pouring down
red rain is coming down all over me
I'm bathing in it
red rain coming down
red rain is coming down
red rain is coming down all over me
I'm begging you
red rain coming down
red rain coming down
red rain coming down
red rain coming down
over me in the red red sea
over me
over me
red rain"

Kate's Oddessy Team is going to World Competition in Denver..(so we get off lucky I guess) http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/wf2005/default.php This just happens to be the same time as Marcon..and I was gonna take one for the OhayoCon team and work it..(meaning..paying my own way..and tix to get in..as well as giving up an entire weekend to sit in the video room..) but If I can't possibly afford to go with her to Denver then I will work Marcon..but I hope I can goto Denver and cheer her on! Strangely I will be in Denver when Jan is at Marcon in Columbus..the irony ..is amazing..However, I will be in Denver until Wed..and might get to see Jan in her natural habitat...and though she is sweet and cuddly her natural habitat is not a Studabaker.

Eh News!!
Broke my computer so bad Jeff had to fix it..it was unbelievable bad.  He came from the great white north to administer the paddles on my computer...then we drove to Pitt.
Best part is it's ok now..bad part is it's empty pretty much...

I have finals tommorrow and should be studying..what else is new.

FUN News!!!TekkoshoCon
Of course the best part of any con is the people that go there and this was no different.Ok..went to TekkoshoCOn and the best part as always was hanging out with Emily D., Mundeemo, Bruce, Greg, and Mike, RIk and Amy H.,Matt H and Adam...and well it was alot of fun and we were the ones having it andstuff I was so happy to see Greg he is like the center of all fun...it swirls around him in pink and blue hair dye colors.  Mike McFarland (who grossed me out all weekend long) was extra funny..and it was just really nice to see everyone. all I can say..as squarely as I can..Shock on.    And I call to all the female sisterhood that we must rally and come up with something as gross for them..and then shock them all night....and I got nothing.

Well..Jeff was nice enough to open his room up and it became the con staging area for hmmm 6 people total.  But I guess it's signs of age cause it didn't have the con squalor that i have come to excpect for a room with that many people in it. Went to the party and did shots with Mundemo and Emily and Amy....that was super fun.  On Sunday night we were extra tired and ended up sleeping four on this huge king sized bed..there was room..but I Have furnace attack I think ..I must glow red in my sleep.   I didn't have the girls and that was sad..but it all worked out in the end.  Kate didn't have practice for her Odessey Team but she did on Monday after school.  We made it to the bus stop JUST in the nick of time..and it was a lovely day so no worries about the girls being stuck in the rain hudled together...waiting for me to get them.

I need to study...did I say that already...

OH I think since so many of us bowl we should try to go bowling..either we have friend con ..and go bowling..andstuff or we try to take a sunday and go."

So ..thanks <lj user=""Studiothreewire""> for making my paper writting not teh suck!"

 Inside me lives a skinny woman crying to get out. But I can usually shut 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  her up with cookies. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy.

&nbsp; before they realized I actually had a hearing loss. And they called ME 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  slow!

<font color=""#800080""> I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- and I'm also not blonde.

&nbsp; &nbsp;  If high heels were so wonderful, men would still be wearing them.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I'm not going to vacuum 'til Sears makes one you can ride on.

When women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. Men invade another 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  country..

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Behind every successful man is a surprised woman.

&nbsp; In politics, if you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; done, ask a woman. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Margaret Thatcher- 

 I have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; career. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  -Gloria Steinem- 

 I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Zsa Gabor- 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission.

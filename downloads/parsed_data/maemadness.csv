"event","Muse-  Perhaps people would believe that I would have been able to sit through the explosion in ignorant bliss.. not knowing until later just what happened.  Yeah, I wish that were so.  Laying in bed with lyrics going through my mind, I felt a tremor through the wall that I was leaned up against.  Faint, many might not have noticed it, but when you depend on such vibrations for information you pay more attention.  It must have rocked the upper floors something fierce what ever it was but down here underground we didn't feel much at all.  



Which scares me more than anything else.  Strange sounding doesn't it?  What?  There is no one here for me to worry about yet.  I've met three people.  I stayed awake thinking of how unaware I could have been.  Did they have any warning?  Probably not, but if it were sound, I'd have been totally without a clue. 
 


I lay there waiting for them to come down and tell us all what happened.  What would be the point of going out into a dark common room and try to read the same questions on other people's lips?  Better just to wait it out."

<P><STRONG>Manon</STRONG>-Mean Erzulie&nbsp;boy!.. I met a boy and a girl out on the lawn this morning.. She was crying.&nbsp; I still say he hit her.&nbsp; He didn't seem to like me much.&nbsp; Not surprised, most people don't like me.&nbsp; That's ok though, we don't like most people either&nbsp; :p Briare was nice.. I liked her, she gave me toys too!&nbsp; Jorge is ok sometimes.&nbsp; I know he thinks some of the pranks are funny even though he tries not to let me see him laugh about them.&nbsp; I'm bored.. maybe the girl will let me get the Erzulie in trouble... </P>

"event","If you don't know what Comus Regency Citadel is then this journal won't mean a whole lot to you.  Even if you do I bet we can confuse you from time to time.  I have too many characters to make a journal for each of them so this is a journal for all of them, as I see them.  Sometimes it is IC and sometimes it is semi OOC ( as in they interact with each other in the mental common room of my mind even though they might not even know each other on the board. ) 

Hopefully you can follow along.  Sometimes its difficult.

List of characters

Maewyn- not really a character, this is me. 

Dharma Xianren- A fire wielding member of House Feray.  Dharma is one of three from that house known as the Firestarters. (interesting that they were all sorted there, but pure chance)  She's my anime chick.  Looks sweet and nice.. don't let it fool you.

Gannon Grayson- A metamorph and a member of House Kalfu.  He's rather calm and seems easy going..looks can also be deceiving in his case.  He's a chaser for the Kalfu Quidditch Team.

Johann ""Stahl"" Silbermann- The Charms and Talismans teacher.  Stahl is a shaper of metal.  He' rather quiet and mostly enjoys watching things that go on.  He does surprise us from time to time.

Madeira ""Maddy"" Messenger- Madeira was once a star chaser for the San Diego Sea Hawks an accident involving another player caused her to be out of pro Quidditch.  She's now the Coach for CRC's Quidditch teams.  Maddy is tall, agressive, full of life and has a wicked sense of humor.  

Adohi Graybear- His whole name A-do-hi-uh gah-sa-di means forest keeper.  He is a quiet member of House Brise.  Many times he watchs the actions of the others with various degrees of amusement and disdain.

Rookie Shelby Sherbourne- He's Deputy Demarcio's shy shadow.  He admires her greatly but can't get up the nerve to tell her.  Shelby has a desk off to the corner of the common room where he works on his files and tries to ignore the antics of the others.  Generally only getting involved when they bring him into it. 

Manon- Appears to be an 11 year old child.  She's the local CRC poltergeist, a child killed in the massacre that closed the school.  She doesn't talk about that time though..She's a prankster and a pest.  Sometimes cute and other times.. 

Aspen ""Muse"" Morgan- Muse is another member of House Kalfu.  He's a writer of lyrics and music.  Our goth boy is a bit bitter, a prolonged illness caused him to lose his hearing when he was 14.  He hears sounds and voices in his head still.  They are all he hears.  The voice of his inspiration."

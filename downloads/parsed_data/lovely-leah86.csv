"event","We had an awsome time camping, the site itself was a disapointment but thats okay. We didnt have a lake to swim in, well there was a lake more like a swamp but still the was a pool that we spent alot of time in. And since we came back troy has been really nice, and i think it might be because he needed a break from work. I have a job interview at Big Al's tommorow, hope i get it but the shifts are really long"

"event","Gerrrrrrr this camping trip is going so shitty first we have plans set out, then rich car break's down so we have to make new plans. Then rich and leanne dont want to go at all. So we make new plans, then rich and leanne wanna come, this is just pissing me off. I wish we  can stick with one plan. My mom is sapouse to pick us up and if more ppl r comeing then i need to know to ask her if it is okay. I just want everyone to go and we all have a great time. To be honest i dont care if rich and leanne come cause i really dont know them anyway, i am not going to  cry over it if they dont come. But if they do come then great more ppl the better. i just want set plans. that will not change. Today i have to ask my mom if more ppl can come in her car if there is enough room. Jesse wants me to flat out lie and say there isnt enough room and just forget them coeming,cause one theny were not apart of the plans in first place and two because he doesnt want to lose ride over them going. But i want to be honest about it if there is room then they can come with me if there isnt then i truely sorry about the way it turned out. i just dont want ppl mad at me casue in our group of friends shit like that always happens. Someone will say one thing, then change there story to another person. And it seems like its always happen's to me. but i can honestly say there r times were i have done nothing wrong, then i will get in shit cause someone else says something different. I hate that you have to watch how you say things to certain ppl. I'm telling you watch my next entry will be bitching about some bullshit of ppl not getting story's right. It only ever owkrs when the whole group of us r together so knowone can lie latter cause we all there."

Later that day my dad made me eat 12 grapes that were so huge, i was like ugh so i only ate 4 and we had to have a white candle and all that crap. ok so school starts back on monday and I DONT WANT IT TOOOOOO lol I've enjoyed my holiday break and want it to continue NOT end, I hateeeee schoooooool! ok thats all."

"event","Yesterday when we got to Grapevine Mills instead of catching the 5:20 show we caught the 7:00 show because we were late. But anyways Papaya is like my favorite store in the world now!! I saw the cutest purse there that I wanted soooooo freakin bad it was only $15 so I might go to Grapevine Mills sometime and get it so hopefully they still have it.Anywayz the movie was good I guess... Lately i've been playing my games (Need for Speed: Underground, Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto Vice City) I like all of them a lot thats why im spending more time lately playing my xbox then on the computer and thatis very unusual seriously. Later today at around 5:00 i'm going to dinner at Gorden,Dawn and Geoffreys so we will exchange gifts and everything. We got Geoffrey Need for Speed:Underground cuz I know hes been wantin it bad. but uh i got nuthin else to say but maybe 2nite 'o' tomorrow i will update again on the dinner. ok bye"

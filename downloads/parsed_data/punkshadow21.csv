The kind where having some anonymous idiot call you an asshole for something you said 3 months ago on livejournal when you were in one of your worst emotional lows and makes you feel like if only you wouldn't have to climb those 10 flights of stairs, you'd jump.  Where the worst part is that you know there's no reason, taht people love you and all that, but you still feel empty and cold.

Yeah.  I'm going to go pass out."

by RdhrdAnimepnk
~~~~
Nothing to come home to
Just an empty house and a cold hard bed
I can't even think through
all this silence screaming through my head

If friendship is forever then eternity is a lie
Silence may be golden, but im fighting off tears tonight

Spat on again, compromise no surprise
Some kind of friend, I despise all your lies

Take and forsake me, go on, desecrate me
Now I know what fake means once and for all
Drag me and rape me, just say that you hate me
Now I know what fake means once and for all

A ripped up parachute wont save this lonely diver
Your unfilled airbag won't protect this drunken driver
A crubling handhold won't support this broken climber
None of my screams could change you, you fucking lier

Set in stone you say, but stone weathers with time
Shining and new one day, later filled with grime

Take and forsake me, go on, desecrate me
Now I know what fake means once and for all
Drag me and rape me, just say that you hate me
Now I know what fake means once and for all

Nothing to come home to, with an empty soul and an empty head
Nothing left to do, just pass out in an empty bed

I love having to worry about what people are saying about me when i leave.  I can't decide if the vindication (aka, yes they were saying shit) or the paranoia (knowing that they're going to) is worse . . . but since i have both i suppose it doesnt matter anyways.

Party people:  Understand, I haven't slept more than 2 hours a night in about a week in spite of getting into bed at 7 and out at 6:45, restless.  So put all that ""oh Eric's being a little emo whore"" out of your head.  Understand, realizing that two of my best friends are people that had me and decided I wasn't quite good enough isn't my idea of a great time.  One image from last night keeps haunting me . . . *shrug*.  But I promised Abby I'd go, and I tried to not put anyone off (i think i did that okay) and I left when I couldn't do that anymore.

Whatever. 

As for everything else, its either gotten worse or stayed the same.  Granted its all going to get worse now.  Lyrics keep spinning through my head ""stare at the phone but no ones callin"", ""sometimes your at your best, when you feel the worst"" *shrug*."

~~~~~
by Hazard (Ie: Me and my bad self, since this one is emo i'll do Will the favor of dissociating him)

I think Im going nowhere 
but I dont know how to get there
Im trapped within this hell
i cant escape myself
I dont know who to be
but im sick of being me
if I could close my eyes then maybe i would see

They say they want you but the last thing they want is the truth
what a wasted youth
Hiding in a smile but i know im just buried in denial
i need peace for awhile

just sitting alone, sitting alone, drowning in my tears
just sitting alone, sitting alone, fighting away all my fears

The embers of my innocence are burning around me
The shards of my ignorance are drowning me
you took away more than I ever thought I had . . .

Burn burn it away burn burn my heart
show me the meaning of true love lost
burn burn it away burn burn my soul
just let this dying world explode


I know im lost without you here
but i dont know how i pushed you away
i know im lost without you here
but nothing i do will get you to stay


just screaming alone, dying alone, drowning in my fears
just screaming alone, wont you come home, help me fight away my tears

burn burn it away burn burn my mind
destroy al the truths that i left behind
burn burn it away burn burn my soul
just let this rotting world corrode


burn burn it away
burn burn my faith
burn burn my trust 
burn burn my cries
burn burn it away
burn burn my faith
burn away your lies

emotions suck they conquer and divide
drag you down and leave you empty inside
and when it feels like your broken and surrounded by lies
its hard not to dream of moonlit suicide

The embers of my innocence are burning around me
The shards of my ignorance are drowning me
you took away more than I ever thought I had

burn it away burn burn my truth
show me the cost of putting my trust in you

burn burn it away burn burn my heart
show me the meaning of true love lost
burn burn it away burn burn my soul
just let this dying world explode
burn burn it away burn burn my truth
show me the cost of putting my trust in you"

Anybody who didn't know about the whole running away Richard threatening me thing, too bad, you miss the first part, but since that started I haven't had more than a half a day break of nothing going wrong.  So yeah now that my mom actually (i think) wants to divorce Richard we can't.  For one, we can barely afford to eat as it is (we had no groceries for a few weeks and i had to lend my mom my paycheck to not bounce checks the next) and we got a letter from the effing trustee and our half assed (cause we cant afford a decent one that gives a shit) lawyer telling us that we need to cut down our travel costs (that we already artificially lowered), that my mom needs to stop putting away any money for retirement and we need to cut down ""child activities"" (which means my AP classes etc . . .) and that we need to pay off all of the bills (which means no real bankruptcy) which means even though we cant get by now except barely we're going to have another $1000 a month bill for 5 years.  That also means we can't sell the house and cant move which means we cant get away from the big DICk (Richard).  On top of that my moms brakes have broken twice in the last two weeks which has built up a few thousand dollars more of payments taht need to be paid immediately for rental car for work, the actual work, etc.  On top of that that means I'm going to keep giving my parents money from my paychecks to help out which means none of the things i was looking foreward to (band trip again, no wcaty, i alreday havent been eating lunch every day and ive been using my own money when i have, and i was going to save all my money, ALL MY MONEY, and go to europe on my own money but now i cant save any).  AND ON TOP OF THAT my GODDAMN MOTHER FUCKING cell phone (that i paid for myself) effing broke in half (literally) which i cant effing replace that had ALL of my phone numbers on it.  I dont even have work or Christa actually written down on paper because some ASSHOLE (richard) threw away my phone numbers.  So for those of you who care my home phone is 571-6150.  

And now, school.  Ive gotten my marquette stuff which means im signed up, but since my councilor is retireing I'm goign to have to do it all myself because she was the one who did all of the college stuff.  Also If i get screwed over by my calc teacher and somehow get a fucking 2 on my calc exam basically my whole goddamn future is ruined.  It means I have to take it again which means no college next year which means i wont win an argument with the school board which means only 2 college classes as a senior which means I have hardly any chance of ful scholarships which means with my parents bad credit (and yes weven when your 18 your credit is reflected heavily by your parents credit) im going ot have the shittiest loans and have to go to a shitty college.

On top of that I have no break in sight, My summer is jam packed with 40 hour work weeks (probably) summer school gym etc . . . and both my AP teachers decided to teach more after the exams and every other teacher is ramping up and I'm already behind on sleep and I'm jsut going to fucking die one of these days.

And i know half the people reading this (half, so dont pull a ""stop being stupid we love you emo-freak"" cause i know you do)  Either dont understand why im freaked out or think It's not a big deal or im exagurrating, but i assure you im not.  you should be happy enough that im trying not to let it bother me and being happy in person and not ranting to everyone even though i hear everyone complaining about little things and feel like an ass because i want to rip my hair out and scream because i really dont need to hear things like ""On no, i cant get my makeup"" or ""oh no, history homework"" or ""oh no, whatever""  although i realize those things suck and im not looking downon you or meaning to be mean, im pissed BECAUSE that stuff is getting to me NOT because your saying it.  but, GUAHHWHAOFIHEWGWOEUHFAIH:FOHQWOHEFUIEHKLFAH MOTHER FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK DEATH . . .

And the only way i can get to sleep is to exhaust myself into unconsciousness, thank you ddr.

Its amazing that i changed mentalities when i did because if i hadnt id be fucking dead inside, and would have been for the last two months.  Im utterly amazed that im still smiling the majority of the time. . . yay . . . i guess.
anyways.

Sorry for feeling like shit, go on with your lives . . ."

Cheer up emo kid

Whatever happened to faith what happened to trust
weve let them slip through our fingers like nothing but dust in the wind
whatever happened to laughter and joy
just thrown away like an old toy in the bin

What happened to that smile in your eyes
where did you put the spark you used to have inside
your not on your own now so dont let yourself go down
if youd just open your eyes youd see your friends around

Why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
why are you settling for less than nothing
why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
its time to stop settling for nothing

Whatever happened to allt he times in the basement
when the only thing to do was sit around and laugh with your friends
do you remember those times in the backyard
nothing on our minds except staring up at those beautiful stars

Theres no reason those times wont come back
except that your always stuck in the past
your not on your own now so dont let yourself go down
if youd just open your eyes youd see your friends around

Why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
why are you settling for less than nothing
why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
its time to stop settling for nothing

So now its time to . . .
take it back, take it back, 
dont waste your life like that
take it back take it back
dont give it up like that
take it back, take it back,
dont waste your life like that
take it back, take it back
dont give it up like that

Why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
why are you settling for less than nothing
why are you living a lie when you know that nothing is alright
why are you settling for less that nothing

Well fuck you.
Tim.
Fucking once again you push  me further down this hole.  Yeha you be happy and hang out with your friend whom ive realeased from what i guess really ended up being a big shitty prison in which i ruined her life unknowingly.
I need someone to talk to that wont just tell me everything is my fault, who wont just ignore who wont just effing push me deeper.  But i dont want to intrude on your happy little world.  Because i guess now according ot certain people im just sad when everone is happy.
ITS BEEN 24 HOURS SINCE I GAVE UP WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST PART OF MY LIFE FOR 9 MONTHS AND I DONT HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FUCKING SAD?????
AND FINDING OUT SHE WANTED TO BREAK UP???  I didnt even want to break up. . .  i just thought it had to be done. . . so i guess i was right.  Doesnt make it feel any better to know i was the bane of her very fuckign existance in a secondhand way.

And no one gives the fuckign credit enough to change, i never wanted to go back to livejournal but this is the only time ive felt like this much shit in a few effing months but its still too ""dangerous"" to get close to me?  Im only overreacting?  

So you fucking push me back to this?  And tell me its my fault when i want intruding on anyone before you effing talked to me?
and there goes more of my life

I dotn know many people who are satisfied with fair weather friends, and im not one of them.  So screw off, ill talk to you, but dont expect shit from me, im sick of being pushed further.  And yeah steph probably wont want to talk to me anymore either because im yet again hurting her ""twin""  so there goes the rest of that huge part of my life, my heart, my existance.

Thanks for everything."

You blew me off again and im trapped within this cloud
choking on these memories, left without a hero now
pathetic self degredation pulls me away and i cant get back

Im sick of being lonely, having nowhere to run
im sick of telling everyone how they should go have their own fun
im sick of being sick of things when i cannot change the facts
in sick of being lost in here with everything out of whack

Im sick of screaming, Without a voice
Im sick of trying, when you dont want me
Im sick of being left here, trapped without a choice

I cant go down, ive gotta change
lift myself up and push the pain away
and so i try but i dont know what to do
everythign i ever do just ends up hurting you

Why do i even bother trying not to feel
where the hell does it get me, it just makes everything unreal
why do i even bother figuring out what to say
what the hell does it do for me, it just pushes you away

Why do i even bother, this cant be me inside
its hard to believe that my sprits still alive

Im sick of dreaming, I want answers,
Im sick of screaming, Without a voice
Im sick of trying, when you dont want me
Im sick of being left here, trapped without a choice

when im broken i and i just cant fight it anymore
when im lost and bleeding and im lying on the floor
when im bruised and angry fighting for one more

when i wish that i could die 
i realize
not everyone can learn to fly

not everyone can learn to fly
just a few grow wings and leave this place
theres nothing left to do but try
find another way to leave this place

but still im sick of dreaming, I want answers,
Im sick of screaming, Without a voice
Im sick of trying, when you dont want me
Im sick of being left here, trapped without a choice

This dark cold night is my barrless cell
this empty feeling is my only shelter
this cold pretender is my hollow shell
why cant i just get out of here

because not everyone can learn to fly
its not always good enough to try
and when im left behind and theres nothing left to hold onto tonight
youll be gone
gone
forever

One littel comment Timmy, on FUCKING COMMENT, and you get set off at me?  Compare me to PMS betty?(thats a geniric term, not being to single you out steph, so dont be all inulted)
And now people are telling me they dont hang out with me because im always depressed and im no fun.  Well if thats the case why bother at all eh?  You ever think that if i had a time of consistency where my FRIENDS didnt forget about me, or get to the point where it feels like theyre forgetting about me, id have more than a two week spell of happiness?  It may not even be thats its done consiously, but it probably comes from being taken for granted, once i dont have a big splash to make, im pushed behind for later, WTF.

The first few were pissed and were more concerned with protecting your own honor than trying to help your friend. In fact, there has been almost no mention whatsoever of the problem that im having at all! None! What the hell.  Im not, or i wasnt going to be, all pissy about past actions, because thats over with, but with people bitching at me about them, how can i ignore it.  

Maybe i shouldve just kept it in, like i have, cause everyone was a hell of a lot happier when i did. (and i realize ill probably get bitched at for this, but ive said it before, you told me i was wrong, but its been true every time ive tried it)

If you care, maybe you should help me get over this before you bitch at me eh?  I wasnt lashing out at anyone to begin with, the comment about the meaningless entries meant noting like what you took it as, i just meant that a few words that can easily be ignored by an agrivated mind and no further action does nothing to help, not that you dont give a damn.

The only things i get to do out of shcool with people ish ang out with steph, who is probably going to tell me sometime son that we spend to much time together like she did before, and have the guys over which i plan myself.  The only person thats invited me to do something in the last couple weeks other than Steph is JOSHUA FUCKING GIERLICH.  What the HELL is wrong with this picture people?!?!?

And everyones apparent infatuation with dave hasnt helped anything either.  Sure i dont know much about him, all i know is he went to St. Mathews when i did, and every time ive encountered him in the last two years hes treated me like im the same immature ignorant child i was in 4th grade, and leads me to believe he thinks im an idiot.  yeah and everyone is going out of their way to hang with him.  Whatever, but it seems more and more to be at the expense of time when people would hang out with me.  Even more, whenever someone else comes along whenever im talking ot them or whatever, they run off to the other person, or so it seems, and im left hanging.

Whatever, better all of your happiness than mine, im never going to be happy with myself i know that, i know how much of a stupid asshole i am so dont bother telling me.  Im sure ill get a whole bunch of half hearted bullshit comments like *oh we love you* with no meaning behind them to this too.  Great.  Whatever, i wish i could dissapear sometimes."

You need less than a 25 to pass the driving test and he gave me a 34, but get this.
The guy told me himself he had like never passed anyone on their first driver test.  Asshole.
Asshole had me parallel park off of a car that was PARKED WRONG, i can parallel park, and he took of 7 points for that, i only misssed my liscence by nine.  On top of that he marked me off for not checking blinds spots that didnt exist because it was a ONE LANE ROAD, thats 4 points there, thats more than i needed.  He made me straight b ack through a snow bank, drive through construction and an accident, and took off more points than he should hav for jsut about everything, i was assured in DE that they would take off like 1 or 2 points for every violation, he took of between 3 and 5 for every one.  FUCKER!!
I shouldve had an 18.

But i sheduled again and got lucky, only 2 weeks, dec. 16 . . . . so kinda score."

covered with tears, scars everywhere
You say im everything but nothing prevails
Ravaged mind just caught up in the gale
Shattered again, but struggling to hold on to your walls
No one knows taht theyre your downfall

2 wrongs dont make a right, nothings wrong tonight

alone im fading, concealed im dying
trapped suffocating, weak but trying
The mirror shows me what i dont want to see
why could you possibly care for me
incorporeal claws rend at my soul
my minds set on overload

strength in numbers, the number is two
love and support, that voice is you

"event","so, Thanksgiving is here again.
I guess this has been one of my better ones, even though im here alone on Thanksgiving night.  Idk, i thought it was a time for family, but my family doesnt do anything.  Steph got sick, but we just kinda watched TV which was cool (as is any time i spend with her), and idk if she slept, and the kids there are monsters, but i actually felt welcome, way better than the faked smiles i get at my dads or my moms friends house.  
I suppose im just being reflective right now, i remember how my mom was in the hospital for the weight loss surgery she had wanted for so long for both thanksgiving and christmas last year.  At least it worked eh?
It probably wont be much better for christmas this year, we probably wont even put up a tree, i figure ill just light the fireplace in the living room and hope i dont get dragged to my moms friends house to be ridiculed by her son, my pre school nemesis.  I hope it snows soon. . . idk why its so comforting to just sit on my back porch, even alone, and just look at the snow falling.

Anyways, ill stop being wistful (and im sure some of you are thinking self centered and mopy) and hopefully somebody will get home soon . . . its so quiet here, too much thinking going on.

Happy thanksgiving everyone, and thanks for putting up with me!"

"event","Well, Im not going to school tomorrow.
Mom decided the eye was bothering me too mucn, she wants me to rest.
And yeah it is.  I really, really dont want to have to have my eye washed out with another liter of NaCl, man that sucked, and this whole vaseline ointment sucks too.  Man, hope you dont get a chemical abrasion on your cornea ever!

Yeah and the insurance company is gay, theyre saying that Richards surgery, the one that he needs done cause its getting almost life threatening, well, they denied that it was medically necessary, so we have to take them to court b4 he can have his surgery.  Fuckers.

Idk.  Hopefully nothing explodes with anyone round here (friendwise) cause things seem pretty smooth (for once).  Eh.  Brighter note, I got new glasses so i dont have to walk around with old one arm here! woot!

Meh. . . off to shove ointment in my cut eye!
OW!"

theyve slipped through our fingers like nothing but dust
what happened to that glimmer of a smile in your eyes
they show nothing of who you used to be inside

gone are the days of grace
the light of the past laughs in your face
left without, drowning in fear
walking alone, standing clear

rending our faith, destroying our minds
Left alone with who we are
no leaps of faith, everything to hide
trapped alone with who we are

"event","Seem a little odd to me, two certain people tend to sign off right when i sign on lately, and even when they dont, they barely realizes ive im'ed them if i do.  Strange.

Anyways, I've run out of steam.
I don't know, I was doing pretty well for awhile too, in the whole, be happy around people department *shrug*

Sometimes I wish i did cut, it would make things so much easier, but as it is im stuck with no guitar strings, richard spending way more time than usual in the room with the piano and writers block.  Yep so im fucked.  Not that i have the energy to do much anyways.  

Lately ive been draggin myself through every day, just holding on for dear life until those last long hours are up to go home and collapse.  Everything is getting to me because ive been flooded with so much tension and its started to overflow.  This is bad.  Obviously.  I feel like im being an ass to everyone at the same time too, idk, some people would tell me im usually an ass to everyone but thats besides the point. 

Idk.

Idk whats going on with my friend int he hospital, idk whats going on with my dad, idk whats going on with richards surgery, idk whats going on with anyone here, i just dont know.  Idk what going on in my own head.  Idk how much longer im going to last without some resolution on all this crap its just weraing me out.

Pros: I may be getting some strings tonight so i wont be stuck without.

Cons:  yeah you dont want to hear me bitch anymore

yeah.

"event","I forgot to add this to the post about last night.  JFK ended up calling 5 (not 1 or 2, but 5!) four hour diverts.  We ended up taking the few pts we had there anyway, but it was obvious that the divert wasn't because of lack of beds.  There was a complete lack of staff.  There were at least ten beds open, but we were completely ignored (even worse than usual) for at least 15 minutes.  It got so bad our pt started unstrapping himself from the stretcher and asked if we could wheel him outside to have a cigarette, and this was with a broken ankle!  This is just another one of those situations that solidifies my thoughts on not being an ER doctor."

<i>I WANT TO TELL YOU LIES

I want to tell that little boy his Mom will be just fine
I want to tell that dad we got his daughter out in time
I want to tell that wife her husband will be home tonight
I don't want to tell it like it is, I want to tell them lies

You didn't put their seat belts on, you feel you killed your kids
I want to say you didn't ... but in a way, you did
You pound your fists into my chest, you're hurting so inside
I want to say you'll be OK, I want to tell you lies

You left chemicals within his reach and now it's in his eyes
I want to say your son will see, not tell you he'll be blind
You ask me if he'll be OK, with pleading in your eyes
I want to say that yes he will, I want to tell you lies

I can see you're crying as your life goes up in smoke
If you'd maintained that smoke alarm, your children may have woke
Don't grab my arm and ask me if your family is alive
Don't make me tell you they're all dead, I want to tell you lies

I want to say she'll be OK, you didn't take her life
I hear you say you love her and you'd never hurt your wife
You thought you didn't drink too much, you thought that you could drive
I don't want to say how wrong you were, I want to tell you lies

You only left her for a moment, it happens all the time
How could she have fell from there? You thought she couldn't climb
I want to say her neck's not broke, that she will be just fine
I don't want to say she's paralyzed, I want to tell you lies

I want to tell this teen his buddies didn't die in vain
Because he thought that it'd be cool to try to beat that train
I don't want to tell him this will haunt him all his life
I want to say that he'll forget, I want to tell him lies

You left the cabinet open and your daughter found the gun
Now you want me to undo the damage that's been done
You tell me she's your only child, you say she's only five
I don't want to say she wont see six, I want to tell you lies

He fell into the pool when you just went to grab the phone
It was only for a second that you left him there alone
If you let the damn phone ring perhaps your boy would be alive
But I don't want to tell you that, I want to tell you lies

The fact that you were speeding caused that car to overturn
And we couldn't get them out of there before the whole thing burned
Did they suffer? Yes, they suffered, as they slowly burned alive
But I don't want to say those words, I want to tell you lies

But I have to tell it like it is, until my shift is through
And then the real lies begin, when I come home to you,
You ask me how my day was, and I say it was just fine
I hope you understand, sometimes, I have to tell you lies

""AND YET STILL I VOLUNTEER""
by Eric Levdahl

I try to save this child but he's met his fate.
His innocent eyes are void of hate.
He and his father weren't walking far
When they were both struck down by a drunkard's car.
This night I know I will not sleep.
These terrible images my mind will keep.
I know these nightmares linger near.
And yet still I volunteer.

Her eyes well up - compress the chest
Say a silent prayer - then two quick breaths.
She's done this many times before,
This fight for life kneeling on the floor.
But this time it's her best friend's mom
Whose lifeless body she is working on.
This call like others will end in tears,
And yet still she volunteers.

>From slumber woke by a siren's wail
He rushes out in bitter gale.
While others sleep this stormy night,
A raging blaze this man will fight.
He bravely puts himself in danger
To save the home of a total stranger.
Body cold and tired, he feels his years,
And yet still he volunteers.

We train, we test, we do our best.
We give an awful lot of time
And don't get paid a single dime
Thanks is a word we seldom hear.
And yet still we volunteer.</i>"

"event","There is a bar located across the street from our building. Well last night around 2 am, we noticed that there was an extra car in our parking lot. We knew the bar was going to clear out around 2:30, so we took one of the ambulances out that we don't use and put it behind the car so that it was blocked in. When we saw someone crossing the street to get to the car we ran to the upstairs bunkroom window to watch.

A guy turned up with a woman, saw his car was blocked in, then proceeded to take out this ugly fur jacket and make out with the girl right in our parking lot. We were cracking up!

The guy then tried to move the car out (a Jetta) past the ambulance and a rather high curb. He didn't make it. So two of my co-workers took another ambulance out and went flying through the parking lot, lights and sirens. The couple paused for a moment and went back to making out.

We finally went out to make it seem like we had just noticed them, and the guy asked if we could move the rig. When we had parked it there, we put the spare keys in the ignition and locked the doors. We pretended we didn't have the keys, and we searched for them.

Then two other guys that were with them came over, and they were obviously EtOH. The one guy tried to tell us he was a state cop, so we asked him to show us some ID, but then he tried to back his way out of it. At that point the girl left, so apparently it was just someone the guy had picked up at the bar. Finally, my chief came out with the other set of keys, and they moved the rig.

It was possibly the funniest thing we've ever done while we were bored at the squad. Can you tell it was a slow night?"

"event","So I haven't really updated these past couple of weeks.  Its been unusually slow lately.  We've only been getting 2 or 3 calls in a 12 hours period, and that's on a Friday night.  Although I did see my first dead body two weeks ago.

We were all rather bored and watching TV when Brian answered the call phone.  He told us it was CPR in progress, but didn't bother to tell us that the pt was DOA.  So we all rushed out of there very quickly and made it from the builing to the loc in 2 minutes flat, going about 60mph on Green St.  We get to the house and it was crawling with PD.  The mother of the pt was screaming her lungs out in the background, so Miguel and I grab the AED, suction and O2 kit.  But when we got up to the pt, Brian picked his arm up and his whole body moved.  He was in full rigor, and was even blue.  Poor guy was only 28, dead of an overdose.  So Miguel and I took the equipment back out to the rig, but the detectives from PD had just arrived, and stopped us.  We had to sign a crime scene/evidence log for PD, then we just waited in the rig for Pete and Brian to finish.  They had to call medics out so that they could actually pronounce.

Last Friday was so boring.  We only had 2 calls and that wasn't until 1 am. They were both calls where the pt's shouldn't have called an ambulance.  One guy had the flu, definitely could have gotten himself to the hospital without us.  And another was a little girl with a fever.  The parents had us take her to the hospital. Both pt's ended up in the lobby triage area anyway.  The parents on the second call definitely had new parent syndrome.  

I finally finished my EMT class this week.  Now I just have to wait until Feb 20th to take my state test.  I hope it doesn't take too long to get the results back.  Before I get anything in the mail though, I can check the state website: http://www.state.nj.us/health/ems/emtcertsearch/search.shtml to see if I made it.  

I also have to start writing up my journal for ExEd.  I think I'm going to have to write up a key so that all of the abbreviations so that Dr. Hutter understands what I'm  even trying to write about.

I'm just happy that I'm also done, and will be an EMT in about a month."

"event","Well, it's Christams Eve, and I absolutely have to write about what happened last night.  We had a couple of calls.  But we had one where PD had asked us to stay away until they had the scene under control.  So we waited for a minute, then they gave us the go ahead.  But when we got there it was complete chaos.  It was in the parking lot of a local bar/restaurant for an assault.  When we got there they were clearing the bar, and all of the patrons were rushing towards us.  We finally find our patient, a stabbing victim who is still walking around, but then he runs off and joins another fight that broke out in the parking lot.  We tried to get PD to take control, but they were all sitting nice and cozy in their cars.  Then they tell us to move our rig! Like we're the problem in this situation.  We finally get the guy into the ambulance, but he refuses to get on the stretcher.  He had a large scalp laceration just anterior to his ear, and we were trying to get him to keep a gauze held there, but he kept trying to get up to 'get his boys' to come with him to the hospital.  Then he wouldn't stay off of his cell phone.  When we finally get to the hospital, Pete went in to get a wheelchair since he had refused to sit on the stretcher.  When the pt stood up he said his leg hurt, so we looked and there was fresh blood coming from his hip.  Apparently he had been stabbed there too, and didn't even notice until we got to the hospital.  He was a real pain to deal with.  While we were writing up our paperwork at the nurses' station, the security guard for the ER comes in and informs us that the pt's two friends are in the lobby.  So we made sure that he knew not to let them into the ER.

This call was absolute chaos.  In class they're always saying that our safety and the safety of our crew comes first and foremost.  But last night was the first time I actually saw why they say that.  At one point one of the people from the restaurant got up in Pete's face like he was going to start hitting him then ran off to join the parking lot fight.  It was scary, and Pete and Brian tried to get me to stay in the rig while the scene was being cleared, but I was seriously afraid they would start mobbing the ambulance.  I don't think I want another call like that for a good long time."

It was rainging pretty badly by the time that one came around, so I got pretty wet.&nbsp; The medics on this one were real assholes too, the guy that was in the back with Brian and me was really rude, both to us and to the patient.&nbsp; When we got to RBMC the female on pushed the patient out of the way(ont he cot) so she could get to the admitting counter.&nbsp; 

Last was a ""stabbing"", and I use quotes around that because that's how the call came in, but the guy pretty much had a paper cut.&nbsp; It was three tiny slashes on his stomach that wasn't even bleeding byt het ime we got there.&nbsp; Plus his story didn't add up and I think the PD were thinking the same thing.

So after we were pretty much done for the night a bunch of us popped in Forrest Gump.&nbsp; Twas a good time had by all."

So for a part of the night we took out one of the rescue trucks and did stuff to an abandoned shopping cart in the parking lot next to the building.&nbsp; We used the jaws of life, the big hydrolic cutters, and the blow torch.&nbsp; Quite a lot of fun, but the rest of the night was really boring.

"event","I had my first code friday night.&nbsp; That was the last call of the night.&nbsp; First we went to the WHS football game.&nbsp; We ended up having to run out of there for a call but we were cancelled on the way, so we went back.&nbsp; Then we had to run out again for another call.&nbsp; It was an elderly woman that needed transport to the hospital for vomiting.&nbsp; I had to use the stair chair again, but what got me really mad was that Nick, the other person with me who is also the cadet captain (ie under 18), apparently didn't think I could lift this lady.&nbsp; She wasn't exactly a lightweight, but I'm definitely not a wimp, I could probably carry more than he could.&nbsp; He insisted on going stair by stair for the first few stairs but I told him to just keep going after that.

Second call was a rollover on the parkway. When we got there the SUV was on its roof and the two guys were already out, they were really lucky.&nbsp; They only had a couple of scraped on their hands and noses.

The last one was the code.&nbsp; We got the call from dispatch for flu-like symptoms, but when we got there the guy was facedown and blue on the floor.&nbsp; First off this guy was huge, at least 500 lbs.&nbsp; So we called for list assist after it took four of us about 10-15 minutes just to roll him onto his back.&nbsp; The two EMTs we were with did CPR while Miguel and I helped with suction and AED until the Medics came.&nbsp; We ended up having a bunch of firemen, PD, medics, another EMT team, and the four of us all at the scene.&nbsp; It was really hard getting this guy out of the house too, but at least he was on the first floor.&nbsp; During transport there had to be at least 6 people or more in the rig.&nbsp; They actually got a pulse back on the way to the hospital, and we ended up wating around for about an hour in the ER cause our EMTs were helping the doctors.&nbsp; 

So that was my first code, and I read in the paper that the guy died on monday, so at least he held on through the weekend.&nbsp; Even if he had lived though, he would have been a vegetable because of how long he was down.

"event","Just got back from my first time in the rig.  We went to the high school for the football game and left just before the 4th quarter.  After a couple minutes back at the squad we got a call.  It was an injured prisoner at the police station.  Apparently those kind of calls are called 'sally'(I don't know if I spelled that right) calls.  I'm still kinda sketchy on what I can and can't talk about, so that's it on that for now.

Also...anyone know where to buy 'EMT' pants (navy blue, lots of pockets, etc) and some good heavy duty shoes?

"event","So I've had my first class, and I just have to say that so far it seems pretty easy.  I read what I was supposed to in the textbook, then we had lecture.  Everything he said was directly from the book. I even did some of the workbook problems while the lecture was still going on. I realize that it is the first actual class, and that it will probably get harder, but so far I'm not that impressed.

On another note. I am quite fed up with Woodbridge EMS.  They strike out one more time in my opinion and I'm going to look for another squad to work at.  First they gave me the wrong form for the class, and didn't tell me the proper way to actually sign up for the class.  Apparently there is an application form, and they just told me to call the instructor to sign up.  So I just found out thursday that I had a ton more paperwork to bring in.  I've got that mainly settled now, but another thing is my CPR card.  Apparently I need proof that I took the class and passed as I didn't have the actual card yet.  No one bothered to tell me this when I signed up.  So I finally got told this last week, and I immediately called the station after orientation so that I could get a letter from my instructor to certify that I was just waiting on my card.  I ended up leaving a message for him, and his partner told me he would call me back. Well he didn't, for two days.  Then I kept getting message after message back and forth and he finally decided to leave the letter for me at the station so that I could pick it up myself. I went to get it tonight, and lo and behold, my CPR card was actually there!  I just need to get something signed tomorrow night and that should be all the paperwork that I need for now.

They also have not contacted me at all about actually volunteering while I am in this EMT class. I got a letter a few weeks back that they had my application, but nothing further. Hopefully the ball will start rolling soon.

"event","So I went to orientation tonight. It was way more than I expected. There were so many rules, and the textbook is <i>huge</i>!  Orientation was two hours long and all we did was talk about the rules.  The class finishes up mid January and then I can take the EMT class, but apparently the state of NJ has decided they they might not use the NREMT, but some other kind of test.

I was going to post a whole bunch more, but my brain is fried from monmouth classes all day long and then orientation.

"event","So I've been playing phone-tag with several people trying to register for the EMT class that starts this week at the Middlesex Fire Academy and I finally got an actual person to talk to and all the forms that I need.

I have to go tonight at 7pm for orientation, and I have absolutely no idea what to expect.

More on that later.

"event","So I went to take the CPR/AED course for the professional rescuer tonight.  I was there from 6:30 until 12. I had to stay later than the rest of the class because they were minors and couldn't stay so late, so they have to finish up tomorrow night along with doing the first aid class.  So I took the test, but it took me three tries to get the right score, and I finally ended with a score of 95 on the written (only 1 wrong) and I did perfectly fine on the practical.

Apparently the next step for me is to familiarize myself with the rigs. I can't start actively volunteering until my fingerprinting comes back which apparently takes about a month.

I'm also going to take the EMT course, so that even after my 80 hours for ExEd are over I can be a real EMT-B. The class itself actually sounds pretty hard.  It's two nights a week (Tues/Thurs) from 7-10 at the Sayreville Fire Academy.  I can stop there after my last class (German).

Here's a link for the listing of the classes: <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/dhss/ems/courses.pl"" target=""_blank"">Classes</a>

I guess that's it for tonight. (8-16-06)"

"event","Went today to town hall to get my fingerprinting done.  Apparently its now required of everyone in police, fire, and rescue now because a few years ago there ended up being a convicted murderer in the fire department.

"event","This past saturday (8/12/06) I got my CPR/AED certification for adult/child/infant and first aid.

Went today to the squad building (is that what it's called?) to apply and all that stuff. Filled out the application, tomorrow I have to go get fingerprinted at town hall, and then wednesday night I have to go back to the house at 6:30pm for CPR for the professional rescuer.

I was also told that I need to take an EMT class which they pay for.  It lasts for four months and is considered part of volunteering.  So hopefully that will fulfill my ExEd requirement, but I'll have to talk to my advisor.

That's all for now. (8-14-06)"

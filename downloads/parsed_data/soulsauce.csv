Time...time ticking on me, alone is the last where I wanted to be. Scrambled my troubles away, drown my sorrows in the same way. It seems like no matter how I try it still feels like there some thing missing. How many rules can I break? How many lives can I make? How many roads must I turn?...to find me a place where the bridges are not burned. <center>You wait for the perfect time, you wait still the sun shines through, wait till you don't know more, wait till you know your sure, and wait too long...I will be gone.<center>"

"event","Lala told me that when it comes to Mr. vanished.. I felt sleepy... ending our sms conversation with the line "" I'm sleepy na'"". It's not that I don't want to talk about him, but not now. I'm tired of building theories about him, like maybe he's like this and that... maybe maybe...My head hurts thinking too much about him. Were good friends, and I'm happy with that. I think I'm just enough of the twisted sunshine, It's always a lovely day for me waking up with the cool breeze and a good sun. I don't want to start it with cloudy, sad scene. There's a new light for tomorrow, It's a new set of mood I prefer before I go to sleep, it's a weird therapy but it works so alright.
Ok. I wake up at 9, make some coffee and light some nicotine, prepare my laundry, fix my bed, play with teeger. I think coffee + nicotine + a good music = lj... a good thing to start my day. It's a rock day off today.

See you later Trix and Mae. ;-)"

<center>I miss you on your birthday,
Not only for your smile,
But for the piece of me that's gone,
Left within your care.

I'm in an empty hallway
And have been for awhile,
Gazing inwardly towards home,
Neither here nor there.

How quickly we've turned distant!
The months pass by like years.
How could friends so inseparable
So soon seem so apart!

How imprecise the instant
Held hostage by my tears!
Though Time may seem insatiable,
I have you in my heart.<center>



Happy Birthday Lala!"

I felt a familiar comfort that comes with smiles sparkles, it flushes my skin, my heart swells up in gladness as I trace my footstep around life and love it crushes over me like a little girl. 
Everyday could be a first time for something new. It could be a formless flow of magical symphony with possibilities and curiosity... it had me peeking through the world of happiness."

"event","I think I'm going crazy with work, haha.. There are little funny things happening around lately. First, officemate project ""chimay"" I prefer not telling the reason why I named her chimay. She have these pronounciation deffect with ""t"", it's like over pronouncing t with the words she use, it's annoying really. We spent lunch together sometimes, and that I found out she likes soy sauce too much, she puts it all over her food and I just watch her and wonder how salty it looks like, but she enjoyed it and every lunch we had it's always the same old toyo scene. 
     Second, whoa!   chimay is from bataan, we spent some short talks at the office and i found out she's one of the 'others', one of the so called kalaban's. But chimay being one of the kalabans didn't bother me, yet I enjoy it hahaha.... she may be fooling around with some ka-plastikan stories but she can never bitch around with me. 
     Ok enough of kalaban part, I just had these call from a demanding-over reacting guest and it piss me off. I kept on hearing ""Your management is too bad"" ""Your hotel service is too bad""...but but but.. She kept on requesting too much grrr... and as part of work I find ways to give 99% of her request just to end our heart attacking conversation. And the crappy part is.... she cancelled her booking at the end of the day. OMG! I spent my day just to give what she wants and that's it? a cancelled booking? Shit!

and I hate her for God's sake.

my day didn't end that good...

it feels like the world should have changed
And things still look the same
I think I'll leave it again to tomorrow 
Still unpack and trying to forget for one more night
That I'm back in my own road
Like the cars that never stop going through the night
Is it the life where I can't watch sunset
Do I still have time...

It seems like a sand in my shoes
I can't shake the thought of you
I shake it all to forget you
Why? why would I want to?
Should I ran back?
I know we never said goodbye
Everything is confusing but
I wanna see you again...

i thought that i should tell you
how much i miss you
remember what you used to say
""friends forever, i hope that we'll remain this way..""

All this time, i've been thinkin' bout the way we used to play\the promises we made..
you're everywhere i go i can't escape you,
when i close my eyes i see you
even in my sleep i think of you.. 
i miss you..

Can we put the blame on the changing times?
where have all the years gone by?
so fast, so young,
so sure that this will never end
i'll always stand by you, my friend

"event","You are like a ferris wheel that spin spin spin

              I've been one of your foolish circus passenger

            I let myself belive in your dramatic lovely lights

          I believed with the promise of riding on with you alone

                   But forgetting to look up and down 

                I didn't know that it was coming on to me

                          I saw other passengers

                        Fooled, Hurt, Knocked down.

                   Being with you is like a ferris wheel, 

                           The fun, love, joy...

                            didn't last long.



HAPPY BIRTHDAY A.B IV!"

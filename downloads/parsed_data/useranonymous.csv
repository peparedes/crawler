"event","Michi, this one's for you.

I've been listening to some KPop/R&B just to get more exposure to the Korean language and there's this one song that was stuck in my head for like 2 months, lol.  It's ""Don't Don"" by Super Junior. Well, I looked it up on YouTube and whattaya know it's full of ""pretty men"" but still with a hardcore attitude so I thought I'd post it for your viewing pleasure. Note that this video is the manliest ever that they have been, lol.  And that one guy in the long red hair(HeeChul) has been famous for a while now and his sexual orientation is STILL a mystery, lol. 

Here's the LOW QUALITY version if you're in a shaky connection.

Here's the link for the HIGH QUALITY version for broadband. You might need to let it load for a minute or two.

Not sure if you like KPop but it's cool non the less.  I really like the song and I hope you will too.

I can't find my phone right now so I might have to get a new one soon if I don't find it in a couple of days. That sucks but oh well.

On a side note: I played a really really cruel joke to a good friend and the more I think about it the worse I feel about it. Damn I'm an idiot. Talk about not thinking before speaking! Ah well, if she doesn't talk to me EVER after that I don't blame her. I'm really really sorry.


As always, keeping busy here. I'm aiming to get promoted to Sergeant this year, and considering the upcoming deployment this seems to be a big year for me to be able to make a big difference to the Battalions mission (like anyone here cares but I thought I'd put it out there anyways, lol.) 

Sorry I don't call more often. You all take good care of yourselves, and best of luck.

-Bill"

Oh and by the way, Michi, I got your text. I'll come get the rosary next time I'm in town, thanks.
Hmm... Do you also have one of my knives?  It's a small, green, ""Predator 2"" type knife."

"event","Well, mine wasn't bad.  A lot more uneventful than most day offs actually.  I hope yours was a little better than mine though, all I did was surf the net and go through the drive-thru at Jack in the Box.  Yeah, kinda lonely christmas. Since I just recently got done with a shitload of travelling I didn't feel like taking any leave so I'm spending the Holidays here, which sucks because damn near everyone else is home. And the fact that, yet again, nowhere  The service on my phone is turned off because I was out of the country and I didn't want to pay for the time when I wasn't using it.  And since I found out that I gotta do another mission off-country again, this time in the Philippines, I've decided to leave it off until I come back in February. Not that any of you EVER EVER call me, but I'm nice enough to let you know anyway, lol.

I'll probably go on myspace more, since it seems to be the best way of keeping in touch with the people in the U.S. no matter where I am on the globe without using a cell with international service (my boring ass work-only phone  >:(  I wish they would just let me use it.)

I guess just send me a message on MySpace if you guys are ever curious about what's up (Which is NEVER! You guys suck, lol.)"

I'm going to finish putting up some Japan pics on MySpace tomorrow. If only I can find all the ENGRISH pics I took, lol. There were a couple of things I was too slow to draw my camera out, like a hotel called ""First Wood"" and such, hehe.

Kinda glad I'm going back to Oki in July.

Clingy, emotional, and very private - it's hard to escape a Cancer's clutches.
And while Cancer will want to know everything about you, they're anything but open in return.

Oddly enough I don't think I've ever dated a Gemini. Just the prospect of it seems like a nightmare. I can't even stand myself, let alone a female version!!!

I disagree with this quiz. ""Serious and to the point""? I happen to be very goofy and I munky around before I get into any point, lol. I hardly consider myself sadistic, I'm a classic oliver fucking twist! Anti-social w/ little patience?  Well nowadays I virtually have no patience in people but I'm still a social animal. That's it Rum and Monkey!  I've had it!  I'm sick of your lies! We're OVER! OVER!!!  I'm gonna go kill myself now!


On a serious but still funny note, my friend's wife just tried to kill herself out of guilt of cheating on him while he was deployed. She tried to O/D by swallowing 8 grams of tylenol! HAHAHA!!!  She had numerous other drugs at her disposal but she chose tylenol, rofl!  Soooo basically she got a gigantic headache. She's a pharmacutical technician too! She knows that maybe a couple of grams more and in <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2133"">acute</a> <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10915"">acetaminophen</a> overdosage, dose-dependent, potentially fatal <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3704"">hepatic</a> <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4514"">necrosis</a> is the most serious <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12073"">adverse effect</a>. <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5298"">Renal</a> tubular necrosis, <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18046"">hypoglycemic</a> <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2803"">coma</a> and thrombocytopenia could've also happened. You live in School of Infantry for a while and you learn quite a few things about attempted suicides, especially from Navy Corpsmen. If she really wanted to die she could've made it happen but damn did she get enough attention from that.  She lied about the baby she just gave birth to as well.  IT'S NOT HIS! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

On a good note, Michi, I have a day off tomorrow so I'll send the thing through Western Union but could you please send you addy again? I think I deleted and cleared it, lol. Bravozulu02@gmail.com .  But anyway, also don't forget that Heroes shows tomorrow!  GAH!"

On a side note, I'm getting a good camera soon and I'm taking a shitload of pictures all over the place. I'll make sure it's underwater usable too 'cuz I wanna take some pics with myself and friends swimming with the sharks, hehe.

Oh and another thing: Michelle you poo poo face! You didn't call me back after your shower so I'm going to blow up the world now. Lol, no but really I just wanted to give you some shit for forgetting. By the way, have you been keeping up with Heroes lately? Oh man, Jesus Hollyfield Kristoff you should be!

"event","Happy valentines everyone!

If you don't have an official ""significant other,"" take solace on the fact that, somewhere, someone is thinking of you. Chances are, he/she thinks of you nonstop whether he/she likes it or not. It's one of those old valentines day quirks.

I've noticed that, lately, hardly anyone posts that often anymore. Not that I ever regularly do, but I still kinda enjoy reading/hearing about your day no matter how uneventful you believe it might have been. So START POSTING!

Got back from the field this weekend. We went to the Kahuku training area and set up a base there. It was basically a week-long, militarized camping trip. Just picture a gigantic paintball game in the jungle, woot! Well, it wasn't exactly like that but it was pretty fun, hehe. Also made us remember what we really do. We refreshed our land navigation skills on 5 square miles of hilly Hawaiian jungle and brushed up on our patrolling and ambushing tactics. We actually got to ambush another squad while they were patrolling. Our concealment was so well done that I was within 3 meters of them as they walked by ""tactically"". It really looked like something you would see in a movie or a recruiting video, running around in camo paint and such. It was one of those experiences in which, while you're there doing it you're completely serious and doing your job, but 5 minutes after getting back to base you're laughing and joking about it. It really was fun. 

My arm is a lot better now, obviously since I was allowed to go on the field. A LOT better. I'd rather have broken bones that tear any ligaments/tendons any day, and this is exactly why. It's healing so much faster than my ankle last year. I'm still on Light Duty but I've been going to MCMAP (Marine Corps Martial Arts Program) and I recently got my green belt, same belt level that my Drill Instructors were. I'll be working towards my brown belt so I'll probably be a black belt not too long after I get promoted to Corporal. Who'd ever thought that working hard on something would pay off, eh? In about 8 months or so I'll be qualified to go to the MCMAP Instructor Course (or as I'd like to call it, 3 weeks of pure hazing, lol!) so I'll be teaching martial arts again. wee!

I've been selected to go to Coach's Course due to my rifle range score so that's great. It's a month long course on how to instruct other Marines on how to be a better marksman on not just rifles but handguns as well. I guess I'll be a teacher after all, but in a much different way than how I used to imagine it, which was History or English, not Marine Corps Martial Arts or Range/Combat Marksmanship, hehe. Ah well.

In terms of career planning, I'm not sure how to go about it yet. My original plan was to go to Officer Candidate School after some time as Enlisted, and I still have that option. But a lot of things have changed since then and some crucial parts of that plan are missing at the moment. *sigh* I've also been given the option to go to The Citadel, but right now I have no motivation to take'em up on it.  bleh!

Someone call me or something. I actually have a day off today, hehe, because I notified my chain of command that I got some shit being shipped over here and it's arriving today. If you read through this absolutely pointless post then please respond just to let me know you're alive. And if you have the time, call me. I'm sure I'll be having a lot of free time today. I *could* spend it playing video games but I'd rather be chitty chatting, and I got a shitload of minutes on my cell that I never use anyway...

You can tell by the time that I'm posting this that it's very early/late right now. I have to stay up all night because I'm the Duty Non-Commissioned Officer of the Barracks tonight, and I needed a break from paperwork. And I'm bored. And I'm in a whacky mood b/c I'm bored. And you guys are important. And it's valentines day. And... schtuff....


POST AND CALL! BLAH! BOO BOO GA GA! .... uh... YEAH!

"event","Having a lot of mixed feelings about everything.  Feels kinda wierd and unnatural calling it ""home"" but blah.  Been a hellish month oh, haven't had time to relax, work out, or do anything I'd rather do than... Bullshit.  Speaking of which, lost fat and gained muscle, but I'm not too worried about it, just a little peeved.

Met an interesting person three weeks ago and ended up being very good friends. Very thick Scotish accent, hehe, entertaining.  Apparently has played every single videogame, seen every single anime ever made, and fluently speaks Japanese, which made for interesting conversations. 

Graduating tomorrow... Haven't slept for 5 days so I'm almost at my limit. Good thing we haven't done anything physically rigorous, just mental bombardment (not sure how much better that is...)
My plane ticket was a pain in the ass too, ugh.  400 bucks for a ONE WAY flight from Palm Springs to McAllen.  I don't even want to think about my flight from McAllen to LA... And due to some bullshit I'm currently broke. ARG!

I am, however, looking forward to just relaxing and not having to worry about heavy shit.  I have a shitload of Anime and movies for Michelle.

SEVERELY ADDICTED TO FFXII!!!!  My said Scotish friend (who used to work as a translator for cartoon network) has a friend who was one of the FFXII translators hooked me up with a Collectors Edition copy of the game several weeks before it came out in the U.S. and I racked up 24 hours of gametime the weekend I got it, lol.  I haven't touched it since, until last night, and it's still as magically delicious when I left it alone, woot. So I owe her bigtime, lol.  Did I mention she's a redhead with tremendous... assets... ANYWAY

"event","Suddenly felt like letting go.

Being realistic and realizing things I've always known and believed. This is me, take me seriously.
Living in a world of war, but never wanted a life of war. 

I hate fighting. I always have. If someone pushes me to the ground, no matter how much of my pride is lost, I will try to walk away. Oh, I hate fighting for anything, yet I will always be fighting for some things my entire life. For things that I have done, and for things that I will do, I wonder what the univers deems balanced for me to deserve in my future. I have lived a short life, yet I feel so old. I remember everything. Always felt emotions too mature for my severely immature self.


Trust... Ever since then, I've lost a lot of respect for myself. It feels as if I only get respect from my rank, or how good of a marine I am, or how fit I am, or how well I can shoot. Nobody knows me anymore. I'm Bill, always have been. A lot of people hate me now, hate me for WHAT I am, not even caring about WHO I am. 


To live a simple life:
#1 - Always looking over my shoulder, trusting strangers, expecting to be betrayed, learning. Always been Bill. Understanding the joy of surviving, but not having the luxury, however temporary the restriction. Trust. Seeing a small Iraqi child with a beautiful smile on her face running to the soldier with open arms ready for an embrace, and she says thank you. Everytime I see it, tears roll down my cheeks, because this small girl's happiness is my happiness. Next day in the next town, another small girl smiling and running to the same soldier with open arms ready for an embrace, the little girl explodes, killing the soldier and wounding many innocent civilians nearby. Everytime I see it, tears roll down my cheeks, because all their family's sadness is my sadness.  What kind of people are they, you ask? Let me tell you.  Listen carefully, take me seriously.

I've been there, as hot and stinky as Satan's asshole. I remember everything. The taste of the air, the smell of sand mixed with blood from the nosebleed caused by the dryness. So many secrets, and they are right to keep it from the media. No harm in me expressing, seeing as how I'm one person in a blog that scarcely anybody MIGHT read with no pictures to be of any risk. 40 foot deep bunker chock full of Chemical/Biological warhead weaponry. No WMD's in Iraq? Kiss my bitter ass. Why doesn't it ever show in the news? To give them hope... a second chance in life. 
Who? The 50 female sex slaves trapped, sick, and starving right there with the weapons. Why is ever stash like this? Why do these same people kill civilians? Why their own people? Innocent people! Why doesn't it ever show in the news? Because we are ashamed. Ashamed that we are powerless to give these girls more. One was 14 years old. We can't take care of them, there's no way. We don't have the resources... Refugee camps are the only way. No choice but to drop them off... no money, no food, but with a little more hope. The look of fear and sadness in their eyes. Someday my world will be more than just life and death. No, someday my world will have nothing to do with any of that, no thinking of living or dying. Save for a few things, everything in my life has been my choice, and I don't regret it, and nobody can question my choice. What am I? I'm a person, take me seriously.



#2 - Things work almost as if coincidences don't exist in this world. Things fall into place too easily, sometimes good and sometimes bad. Like some sort of celistine prophecy. I don't seek to understand it. I don't seek to understand anything. So far this very short life has seemingly felt so long. I am a being of tremendous resolve. It has been wavered once, but it still stands strong. I do not pity myself, I do not fear myself, and I have nothing to prove to anyone, including myself. I hold no significance in being remembered but I have no desire to be forgotten. Come whatever may, but I know for a fact that I have made differences in this world that will ripple far through the waves of time. Every warcry, every single shout of heartfelt pain, every single tear evaporated into the air, every single drop of blood to stain the ground, it was all for something. Who am I? Think back, take me seriously.

I'm satisfied, only having one regret, and even that has hope, however feeble the chance may be. I have nothing to prove to anyone, including myself. I've done almost all that I've wanted to do, seen much more that what I've ever wanted to see. Always living in the hustle and bustle of a city or the gritty life in the field. But speaking from the heart, I would prefer a life in a very small, quiet, and friendly town, running maybe a hat shop or a flower shop. Though I have no objections of living alone, I'd prefer to be with someone who I can love as a friend and be my comrade, living with me. Life would be so much sweeter. Someone who deserves my trust is out there. I know there's someone for me to love closely and will let me love her till I die. Maybe I haven't met her, or maybe I have and just don't know it. It takes a lot for me to give up on anyone. Seemingly, it doesn't take much for people to give up on me. I cannot afford to give up on myself if I'm alone. I cannot afford to give up on anyone if I know how it feels. I'm thankful that I'm alive, becoming happy, getting angry, feeling sad. Even that, I will risk it all to save anyone deserving. I mean no intrusions and ask no thanks. Take advantage of me if it makes you happy, I will be no weaker afterwards than before. I don't mind looking like a fool to give someone momentary contentment... to cause an involuntary smile or laugh. I'm a person who laughs and cries just like any other. What am I? I'm human, sensitive and imperfect. Please take me seriously.


#3 - I'm perfectly sane, but we all have our demons. Looking at the clock showing the time... cannot sleep, even after giving a pint of blood for blood drive and 4 vials for a blood test today... have to go to a 5 mile formation run in 2 hours. Never been afraid of nightmares, but still can't sleep. Fighting off the demons, or moreso the demons are debating against each other... If only someone cared to listen to the things I know. So many things to tell. Nobody committing themselves to be trusted.

How far would you go to save a friend? 
'Committing a mistake' is an performing error in action, calculation, opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning, carelessness, insufficient knowledge, etc... 'Doing something stupid' is making a poor decision or a careless mistake. Doing enough stupid shit engraves situational and decisional stupidity into one's personality. Mistakes can be forgiven and/or corrected.  Stupidity is a condition that some people have: an inability to understand or to profit from experience of oneself and/or others'. If you knew that what you/your friend was doing was wrong, would you go through with it anyway? If so, you have no right to make fun of those inbreds on the Jerry Springer Show. If he was hammered, would you let him drive home? Unforgivable by nature. Sooner or later, someone will be paying dearly, and the cost is always too high. Though that story is for another time, I felt the need to express my feelings on a major event two weeks ago.


Ironically, because of my job, I've learned the value of people, and that NOBODY is expendable. Treating people as people and not stepping stones for someone's future.

Someday I will find peace again. If only someone could be completely honest with me. I don't want to be feared. I don't want to be praised. I just want honesty from someone for once. Please, whoever you are, reader, if there even is one, all I ask is to consider trying to understand me, honestly. Maybe you've never met me, maybe you once hated me, maybe you once befriended me, maybe you once loved me. Who am I? I'm Bill. Speaking from the core who I am, so please take me seriously."

I'm posting this here because I have no friends whom I can speak to right now and I feel the overwhelming need to let some of this burden out.  A part of my soul just left me, my perception of reality has just been shaken, and half of my heart just died.  Because of some temporary choices I made that I thought would brighten up our future, it seems that my future will now forever be devoid of a soulmate.  A killer has no use for emotions anyway, right?  Maybe I'm just not in my right mind right now but I know I just lost the most valuable thing I've ever had in my life: Love.  You'll forever be with me, in my heart, and nobody can ever take your place.  Thank you for the happiest years of my life, my glorious, searing, beautiful Phoenix.  To me, you'll always be the most beautiful thing in this world; I'm only grateful to exist in the same universe as you.  I'll miss your comforting voice, your affectionate touch, your loving gaze, and I can only describe your smell with one word... Home.  I'll see you again someday, and I hope for you to be happier.  I'm sorry you gave up on us but I'm willing to do anything to make you happy, even if it means letting you go.  You were the one who got away, you made me happy, made me feel like there was somewhat of a point to growing old.  I'll always love you in the only way I knew how, but if you need an extra friend, hunt me down sometime, or e-mail me or post here or whatever if you want me to call.

Love is a dangerous thing, but while it lasted, it was bliss.  The occasional quarrel or two was at least something in the past to talk about.  I'm grateful that we parted in a very mature, friendly manner.  Time can be very cruel, I was just foolish enough to ask for too much... making you wait was something I had no right to do, and it drove you away.  I love everything about you, and to lighted up the mood a bit I should say that of all the women I slept with, you were the best of the best!  You're a beautifuland strong person in and out, and never let anyone manipulate you into thinking otherwise.  I'll always be looking forward to meeting Dr. Hoffmann someday (If you don't marry first I guess.)  I love you so much it hurts.  I feel like in the end I wasn't good enough to be your partner, but I'm happy to have held you in my arms at one point and experience total bliss.  Contact me sometime and I'll give you a call.

    What makes 100%? What does it mean to give more than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life?

    Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:

    If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.

    Then: H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K.....8 +1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% and K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E

11+14+15+23+ 12+5+4+7+5 = 96%

    But, A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

    And,

    B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%

    AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.

    A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%

    So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, it's the Bullshit and Ass kissing that will put you over the top. I'm not sure if a bunch of asskissing bullshit will help me as a military officer, but hell, one can never know how far an idea can go unless they try... or see someone fail at it... >_> ... <_< ..."

Mr. Cikoch was a biology instructor at a snobby suburban girl's junior college. During class one day he asked his student, ""Miss Simison, would you please name the organ of the human body, which under the appropriate conditions, expands to six times its normal size, and define the conditions.""

Miss Simison gasped, and then said, ""Mr. Cikoch, I don't think that is a proper question to ask me. I assure you my parents will hear of this. ""With that she sat down red-faced.

Mr. Cikoch then called on Miss Hakar and asked the same question. Miss Hakar, with composure, replied, ""The pupil of the eye, in dim light.""

""Correct,"" said Mr. Cikoch. ""And now, Miss Simison, I have three things to say to you. One, you have not studied your lesson. Two, you have a dirty mind. And three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment.""

 One evening a man was at home watching TV and eating peanuts. He'd toss one in the air, then catch it in his mouth. In the middle of catching one, his wife asked a question, and as he turned to answer her, the peanut fell into his ear.

He tried and tried to dig it out but succeeded only in pushing it in deeper. His wife tried to help, but after hours of trying they became worried and decided to go to the hospital. As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of the problem, their daughter's date said he could get the peanut out.

The young man told the father to sit down, then shoved two fingers up the father's nose and told him to blow hard. When the father blew, the peanut flew out.

The mother and daughter jumped and yelled for joy. The young man insisted that it was nothing and the daughter brought the young man out to the kitchen for something to eat.

Once he was gone the mother turned to the father and said, ""That's wonderful - isn't he smart? What do you think he's going to be when he grows older?"" The father replied, ""From the smell of his fingers, our son-in-law!""

A man and his wife were working in their garden one day.

The man looks over at his wife and says: ""Your butt is getting really big I mean really big. I bet your butt is bigger than the barbecue.""

With that he proceeded to get a measuring tape and measure the grill, then went over to where his wife was working and measured his wife's bottom. ""Yes, I was right, your butt is two inches wider than the barbecue!!!"" The woman chose to ignore her husband.

Later that night in bed, the husband was feeling a little frisky. He made some advances towards his wife who completely brushes him off. ""What's wrong?"" he asks. She answers: ""Do you really think I'm going to fire up this big-ass grill for one little weenie?""

 A man placed some flowers on the grave of his
dearly departed mother and started back toward
his car when his attention was diverted to another
man kneeling at a grave. The man seemed to be
praying with profound intensity and kept repeating,
""Why did you have to die? Why did you have to
die?""

The first man approached him and said, ""Sir,
I don't wish to interfere with your private grief,
but this demonstration of pain is more than I've
ever seen before. For whom do you mourn so deeply?
A child? A parent?""

The mourner took a moment to collect himself,
then replied, ""My wife's first husband.""

 Jake was dying. His wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his fragile hand, tears running down her face. Her praying roused him from his slumber He looked up and his pale lips began to move slightly.

""Becky my darling,"" he whispered. ""Hush my love,"" she said. ""Rest, don't talk."" He was insistent. ""Becky,"" he said in his tired voice, ""I have something that I must confess."" ""There's nothing to confess,"" replied the weeping Becky, ""everything's all right, go to sleep."" ""No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I ...

 A man's wife asks him to go to the store to buy some cigarettes. So he walks down to the store only to find it closed. So he goes into a nearby bar to use the vending machine. At the bar he sees a beautiful woman and starts talking to her. They have a couple of beers and one thing leads to another and they end up in her apartment.

After they've had their fun, he realizes its 3AM and says, ""Oh no, its so late, my wife's going to kill me.
Have you got any talcum powder?"" She gives him some talcum powder, which he proceeds to rub on his hands and then he goes home. His wife is waiting for him in the doorway and she is pretty pissed.

""Where the hell have you been?!""
""Well, honey, it's like this. I went to the store like you asked, but they were closed. So I went to the bar to use the vending machine. I saw this great looking chick there and we had a few drinks and one thing led to another and I ended up in bed with her.""
""Oh yeah? Let me see your hands!""

She sees his hands are covered with powder and... ""You God damn liar!! You went bowling again!!""

"event","Just got home, 11:05 (as I type this) from San Antonio after taking a Language Battery test. Apparently I'm qualified to be taught multiple languages so they sent me back to MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station) to take a test. The purpose of it is to check how fast I can learn and pick up a language and how fast I can be able to successfully translate it into English and other languages I know. They basically made up their own language, one with its own grammar, spelling, punctuation, pronounciation, vowel emphasis, and situational rules. Right around the end of the audio part of the test you're required to REMEMBER every concept you've gone over in the test so far and use ALL those rules to translate multiple series of phrases. God damn, it was hard  but it sure as hell was fun.

I took the test with only one other person who was qualified for taking linguistics, he got a 97 on his ASVAB test, name was Cardwell, 19yr (and somehow reminded me a lot of Vince.) This was his second time taking the test, seeing as how he got a 77 his last try 6 months ago and the passing is 100 (and retest has a 6mo cooldown period.) He passed with a 113, and I passed with a 119, Yay! The test itself, just like the ASVAB, had strict time limits, but this was definately more fun.

Was a bit pissed off being forced to take a major test after a tiring shuttle ride, 2 hours of sleep, and countless hours of boredom. We got to the hotel at midnight, ate dinner, managed to catch some ZZZs at 1:30am, had to wake up a 3:30, got on the bus back to the hotel at 4:00 (the hotel was overbooked so we stayed at another hotel,) ate breakfast, went over to MEPS and got there at 5:00, did some paperwork and waited for SEVEN HOURS, ate lunch, test was initiated at 12:30pm, test was finalized at around 2:00, got my test results from the Master Gunnery Sergeant at the office and was complimented at 2:20, shook the hand of a freaking SEARGEANT MAJOR at god knows what time, got on the shuttle home at 5:00pm, arrived in McAllen at 10:20, can't remember what's happened in the past hour...

I'm very tired, and also very hopeful to speak to Alana before I go to sleep because I'll be leaving at 7:10am tomorrow to go to a Poolee function and practice firing the M-16 rifle. Won't be back home till afternoon ; ;

Kalbfusgn! (""Cya later"" in the jibberish made-up language used in the test, haha)"

 In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth and populated the Earth with broccoli, cauliflower and spinach, green and yellow and red vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.

 

Then using God's great gifts, Satan created Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and Krispy Creme Donuts. And Satan said, ""You want chocolate with that?"" And Man said, ""Yes!"" and Woman said, ""and as long as you're at it, add some sprinkles."" And they gained 10 pounds. And Satan smiled.

 

And God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep theV figure that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour  from the wheat, and sugar from the cane and combined them. And Woman went from size 6 to size 14.

 

So God said, ""Try my fresh green salad."" And Satan presented Thousand-Island Dressing, buttery croutons and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.

 

God then said, ""I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them."" And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.

 

God then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it ""Angel Food Cake,"" and said, ""It is good."" Satan then created chocolate cake and named it ""Devil's Food.""

 

God then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before the flickering blue light and gained pounds.

 

 Then God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition. And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fried them. And Man gained pounds.

 

God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99 cent double cheeseburger. Then said, ""You want fries with that?""And Man replied, ""Yes! And super size them!"" And Satan said, ""It is good."" And Man went into cardiac arrest.

 

God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

 

 Then Satan created HMOs.

 

 

 Thought for the day ......There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research. This means that by 2040, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.

===================================================
HERE'S A LITTLE JOKE ABOUT THE U.S. AIR FORCE:


A soldier came to a fork in the road and saw a nun standing there. He asked her, ""Please Sister, may I hide under your skirts for a few minutes.  I'll explain why later.""  The nun agreed to his request.


Shortly thereafter, the two MPs came running a long and asked the nun if she had seen a soldier running down the road.


The nun replied,  ""He went that way"".

 
After the MPs disappeared, the soldier crawled out from under her skirt and said: ""I can't thank you enough Sister, but you see I don't want to go to Iraq.""  The nun said she understood.


The GI said,  ""I hope you don't think me rude or impertinent, but you have the most beautiful pair of legs I've ever seen!""
 

The nun replied,"" If you had looked a little higher, you would have seen the most beautiful pair of testicles you've ever seen!  I don't want to go to Iraq either!"""

""You have no earthly idea of anything about my past, and for this, I forgive you; consequently, you over-stepped your boundaries. Nonetheless, if I am there when Alana/Kevin/Laura meet, you, you have my word that they will not lay a single finger on you, and consider that written in stone, no matter what weapons they may or may not have. However, if, by a shout of any doubt, you may mention anything about any of my past deceased girlfriends on the spot, I will gladly turn my attention away and let vindication have its way with you. Good luck. Personally, anything you've said holds no bearing on either my or Alana's future, so it's not even worth responding to. I hope they don't find you while I'm not around...""

The message above is one hundred percent genuine. If I see unnecessary violence initiated without further live provocation, I will eradicate it. But hell, if she acts up and so much as look at Alana, Kevin, or Laura wrong, be my guest and have your way with her, I'm sure she'd be used to it by now (Ask Sean if any of you would like to confirm.)"

"event","Okay let me get this straight, your reply to that whole post was ""You know she had to lie to you..."" thereby accusing Alana of being a lier. You then tell her that the reason why some of your things don't make sense was because you ""can't argue"" and the reason why you called her a lier and a flip-flopper was because you were mad at me? You then talk of getting mainly pissed because people were agitated before this whole thing happened and didn't tell you, yet you're angry at me for being the first one to actually be honest to you.  Good job.  My initial post contains the exact same ""good intentions"" as Alana's opinions. In fact, she was the one that supplied me with most of these facts to bring to your attention.  Yet it seems you're angrier at me, than her.  You blame your fallacies in logic with you ""can't argue""... Then why argue at all?  She says that you're claiming to fix the problems now. That's good and well but replying to my post by accusing my girlfriend of lying isn't very convincing.

Moreover, Alana states that she doesn't remember an instance of her ever ""feeling like a dog"". You make it seem like you're annoyed of Alana ""everytime she bitches about feeling like a dog"". Name <i>several</i> instances that she stated those words of ""feeling like a dog"".

You make a baseless and insensitive accusation(of which you knew was false) about our private life (sex life, to be exact) and use the excuse that you were angry? What was that you said about honesty?

I entreat you to address these points, although <i>Alana</i> has pretty much already given up hope on you (she's the cynical one, remember?) stating <i>""Why bother posting?  Waste of time and text on her.  It's not like she's going to get it.""</i>  And yes, I even ask permission from her to quote that.

You see, I wouldn't have gotten this hostile if it weren't for you quoting my points and attempting (though unsuccessfuly) to turn my words around on me even though I wasn't the issue.  To top it off, you insult my girlfriend. Then you try to justify it by saying you can't argue or that you were angry. Alana has tests this coming week, and she doesn't need this added stress on her. When it comes down to it, these ""friend"" issues take a backseat to her grades. I don't give a fuck what happens to you, so I don't care for any apologies or even lame excuses.  Either you address these issues, not straying from the topic, with logic and reason, or you <b>apologize to Alana</b> and at least admit that you were wrong to say those things about her.

Your shots to me were useless, and the fact that you went on the defensive with the mere mention of those issues show you were (I don't know if you still are as...) insecure. I was trying to help you even though I didn't like you, especially since your friends didn't want to hurt your feelings. Hell, neither Kevin nor Alana ever said I had to be nice or give you any compliments at all in that post, but I decided to bring out your positive points. I didn't have to be nice, so the first sign of you attacking me was a declaration of war. Again, <b>apologize to Alana</b> and any points that she brings up you need to at least think about. One of the points in my initial post is the fact that whenever you had problems you got insensitive. Well here's an example: You got pissed at me and I was your problem, so you were pissed and didn't care of you insulted either Kevin or Alana.  Then you claim to not be friends with a ""group"" when you were crying and moaning about losing your second family. At least Alana is still trying to preserve it when you're trying to leave.

I suggest you do it over the phone with her when she has the time, but if you insist on playing this senseless little arguement game that you're losing, I'd be happy to oblige. I've done all my schoolwork and projects so I have a lot of time in my hands in between basketball and playing UT2k4."

You have this tremendous opportunity, miss high and mighty, you're getting a free ride through college and here you are spending like a complete dumbass.

<i>Anyway...*rolls eyes* Yeah you know...if you say you know I am intelligent and what not then how dare you insult me in this fashion...Fucking idiot!</i>
At least I <b>thought</b> you were intelligent, but that was before you got defensive and started acting like a ""<i><b>Fucking idiot!</b></i>""

<i>Um...apparently you only read what you want and if you were really informed you would hav eknown...you know hwat..think what you want..In fact *lies* I threw up everything I have ver eaten for the past three months....you like hearing that right...</i>
Haha, I only ready what I want, eh? You seem to be the one who overlooked my positive comments about you in my original post when I was in softcore mode. Even with lipstick your mouth looks wrinkled and dry, and through the make-up people can still see your hallowed complexion from malnutrition. I'm not claiming it's everyday, not even everytime I see you, which is roughly once a week. But most of the time it's apparent.

<i>so you have more reason to pull ALana away from me?</i>
You act as if you two are the <u>bestest</u> friends in the whole wide world and I'm the outsider boyfriend. I'm not the one pulling her away from you; in fact, you were the one already pushing her away before I even said a word about these issues. But of course, you're too high atop your mighty citadel to see that.

And you proceeded to call me dense, good one, hehe. I wonder if a bullet could penetrate your skull right now, because apparently none of what Alana, Kevin, and I am saying is doing so. Was it you who mentioned the whole ""look at yourself before you look at others"" arguement during this?

<i>Excuse me for taking forty minutes from your oooo so fruitful lives...Here...let me get those back for you...</i>
Again, you failed to see the point. That was a mere explanation on how we got started on talking about your damn issues. I hope you never ever join any Lit Crit teams...

<i>You know what? he would have mentioned the cat piss...I would think to let me know and see if I would care...I wouldn't have...I didn't so I took the hat...no that it should be any of your concern...</i>
Pissed on or not, if he didn't care of you touching it, he wouldn't have mentioned anything prior to you meddling with it. I'm pretty damn sure Kevin wouldn't have told you the cat pissed on it, save for Chris or Alana, he would've had more fun with it. Kevin is devious and fun like that  >_>

<i>Ok...I'll just ignore the next time Alana bitches about how she feels like a dog...</i>
Oooh, bad move. Putting words in her mouth is not a good idea. I'm curious as to what she'll say to that. Good job soldier, you just stepped on a landmine.

<i>YOu know what? If you are not any one of my friends you don't have the right to say a GODDAMNED thing...</i>
I feel like I'm speaking to a toddler... let me repeat and possibly clear up some things. I never claim to be your friend, yes. That means I couldn't give a flying badger's ass if you impaled yourself with a flaming, spiked, 40 foot dildo. However, my girlfriend would care. Her happiness is everything to me. The reason why I said something in the first place was because for the past couple of months now she's been ""down"" on many occassions because of you. Down to the point of annoyed. She wasn't the only one, either. If Alana didn't agree with all of those things I said in the initial post, I wouldn't have posted it. I never liked you and always thought you were annoying, but Alana liked you so that was fine with me. And now, alas, you still persist on being annoying.

<i>so next time you feel like ranting you should rant abou thow much of a jerk you are for requiring sex every two weeeks! ANd how that affects those of us who know...OH LOOK now it's everyone!</i>
Oh yes, because you're definately one to accuse! You've had more cocks in your dirty mouth than Brenda's ever even seen. I don't recall a time you only like ONE person, and you claim to be ""in love"" with ""Laz"" when you say things like ""I wanna marry Juch... oops! Did I say that? *dumb look*"". And moreover, that baseless accusation is completely false. Especially, since Alana is very reserved when it comes to talking about sex, she would never have lied about anything like that. I sense jealousy, which is typical considering the fact that you have no idea what love is.
<b>""It's just a vestigial word for an emotion you've never felt""
-Equilibrium</b>
Claiming you're in love with someone while knowing you're willing to sleep with another person (you don't even have to actually DO it. If the thought is there, you're a hypocritical fuckhead) is bullshit.


<i>You know...You had ...whatever...like any of them have never been insulting...</i>
Sorry, we're not all insensitive attention-whores. That post stating you were going to commit suicide and blatantly spitting at your friends' faces in your LJ was plain stupidity. ""You know...You had ...whatever"" Holy shit woman, if you're going to quote something I said, you could at least have a decent comeback to it. Jeez, and you call me dense. I've never, in my life, posting something that completely disrespected <b>everyone</b>(including Grant, who did nothing but ever try to <u>help</u> you). Topping it off, you seemed as if nothing happened at all the next day. I know this because I saw you when Alana came by EHS and, surprise, you were there because if she didn't feed you, you wouldn't eat. Again, toddler.

<i>And you know what it is kind of hard for one to change any behavior when said person does not even know that they are doing anything wrong....</i>
Yeah, fucking right, right? You even said yourself that you were trying to change. Yet those closest around you see no change. You still spend your money like a dumbass (like the recently acquired skirt) and whine about every single thing about you.

You may not have cared to read one of Alana's most recent posts but she has a point on what you might wanna try. Maybe you could turn off your emotions even for like 3 seconds and think about what's been going on.

<i>I'm with Michi...friends with the individual not with the group...although I am unsure of how many friends I will be left with after my posts...</i>
Michi has clearly decided to stay out of this messy shit, so I wouldn't suggest dragging her in. Friends with the individual, you? HAHAHA that's rich! You cried just like Alana when there was talk about the second ""family"" crumbling. I'm not sure if it's just irony or stupidity.

On a side note, I just got off the phone with Alana right before I started typing this post. She's really pissed. No use getting a hold of her because she's currently running to relieve some anger and prevent herself from punching inanimate objects. Last time she did that was when she punched a tree (and left her knuckles bloody) because something ""inappropriate"" happened to Tina. Of course, when these things happen to you, everyone who knows about it gets pissed at the guy. Total violation is unforgivable. Then again, we can't say we were really surprised. You end up crying when these things happen when you know full well how provocative you deliberately dress. Big surprise! ---""Figures""---

Yes, I know, this post isn't very nice at all.  The ""nice"" post was taken defensively, however subtle it was. Have fun with your multiple love interests :)"

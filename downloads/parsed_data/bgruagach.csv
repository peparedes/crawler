"event","Sometimes you just have to make a change.  My website, WitchGrotto.com, was due for one.  So this morning I buckled down and switched the site over from the old Joomla 1.0.x that it was using to the latest and greatest Joomla 1.5.x.  

Making such big jump in the version of the software (from the Joomla point of view anyway) meant the switch actually took me a few months to perform.  It wasn't just one piece of web server software that changed but all the bits and pieces behind the scenes that served up my site.  And since I was updating all the software I decided to also update the template used to give the site its look.  Lots of research, lots of planning, lots of testing and trying things out!  And as with any upgrade it also meant spending a good chunk of time fixing things and changing settings until everything was working the way I expected.

I'm pretty pleased with the upgrade as I managed to preserve all the content (user accounts, forum postings, articles, and book reviews) while switching all of the software used to serve it up. My family will attest to how much stress that can produce.  But it's worth it now that it's done.

Now that my website has the latest software I can take advantage of the latest templates (and the easier-to-use template modification features in the software), new features for presenting and working with content, and new add-ons that can make the site more appealing.

If you haven't seen it come by and check it out!  <a href=""http://www.witchgrotto.com"" target=""newwindow"">http://www.witchgrotto.com</a>"

"event","My thirteen year old son, A, had to deal with homophobia yesterday.

A has a few friends he has over to our house pretty regularly.&nbsp; One of those kids, who I'll call R, has been over many times.&nbsp; Well it seems that we're not going to see R around our house much any more.

R mentioned to his parents that A lives with his two gay dads.&nbsp; R's parents didn't like that. They told R he's not allowed to come to our house any more.

A happened to call R's house to talk to R, and R's mom spoke with my son on the phone.&nbsp; She told my son that she didn't want R to &quot;catch gay&quot; by coming over.&nbsp; My son told her that in that case she also shouldn't let R hang out with another one of their gang of friends, a boy named J, because his family is of African descent.&nbsp; He told her that being anti-gay is just like racism.

She didn't like that and started to go on about it on the phone to my son.&nbsp; So my son did a very rational thing -- he hung up the phone.

I'm very proud of my son!"

In that ancient sense, it is the ability to make things so just by speaking them aloud. Reflecting this is the fact that the Magician is represented by Mercury.

"event","Here's an interesting meme (my response is behind the cut.)  I spotted it on <lj user=""amber_laine"">'s LJ today.

<lj-cut text=""What classic actress am I like?""><p><em>Your result for Are You a Jackie or a Marilyn?  Or Someone Else?  Mad Men-era Female Icon Quiz...</em></p><h4>You Are an Ingrid!</h4>
    					<div><p><span style=""font-size:small;""><span style=""font-size:medium;""><strong>You are an Ingrid -- ""I am unique""</strong>
</span></span></p><p> </p>
<p> </p>
Ingrids have sensitive feelings and are warm and perceptive.
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>How to Get Along with Me</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* Give me plenty of compliments. They mean a lot to me.</li>
<li>* Be a supportive friend or partner. Help me to learn to love and value myself.</li>
<li>* Respect me for my special gifts of intuition and vision.</li>
<li>* Though I don't always want to be cheered up when I'm feeling melancholy, I sometimes like to have someone lighten me up a little.</li>
<li>* Don't tell me I'm too sensitive or that I'm overreacting!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>What I Like About Being an Ingrid</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* my ability to find meaning in life and to experience feeling at a deep level</li>
<li>* my ability to establish warm connections with people</li>
<li>* admiring what is noble, truthful, and beautiful in life</li>
<li>* my creativity, intuition, and sense of humor</li>
<li>* being unique and being seen as unique by others</li>
<li>* having aesthetic sensibilities</li>
<li>* being able to easily pick up the feelings of people around me</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>What's Hard About Being an Ingrid</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* experiencing dark moods of emptiness and despair</li>
<li>* feelings of self-hatred and shame; believing I don't deserve to be loved</li>
<li>* feeling guilty when I disappoint people</li>
<li>* feeling hurt or attacked when someone misundertands me</li>
<li>* expecting too much from myself and life</li>
<li>* fearing being abandoned</li>
<li>* obsessing over resentments</li>
<li>* longing for what I don't have</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Ingrids as Children Often</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* have active imaginations: play creatively alone or organize playmates in original games</li>
<li>* are very sensitive</li>
<li>* feel that they don't fit in</li>
<li>* believe they are missing something that other people have</li>
<li>* attach themselves to idealized teachers, heroes, artists, etc.</li>
<li>* become antiauthoritarian or rebellious when criticized or not understood</li>
<li>* feel lonely or abandoned (perhaps as a result of a death or their parents' divorce)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Ingrids as Parents</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* help their children become who they really are</li>
<li>* support their children's creativity and originality</li>

</ul>

Smeared black ink... your palms are sweaty
And i'm barely listening
to last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath 
where i am

I'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with big block letters 
adherent to my chest
That tells your new friends i am a visitor here...
I am not permanent
And the only thing keeping me dry is where i am

You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with yor door key explaining that i am just visiting
And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving

D.C. sleeps alone tonight

You seem so so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visiting
And i am finally seing why i was the one worth leaving
The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights
And send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening
And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving

"event","I don't know. Better is a relative term. I'm moving on, I guess. Work has helped, and my friends at work. Jonathan, Terry, Thomas, April, Vann ""The Man"". They all help me forget about stuff and have fun at work. I still have my days, though and they're becoming less and less frequent. I'm even trying to tell myself that I actually don't look horrible for a change, since that's what everyone seems to say. It's very odd to have someone tell you you're cute, or whatnot. Even weirder when more than one person tells you. And when a gay guy tells you. Even I have to admit that they do have a knack for those type things. Sorry for not being here as often as some of you'd like. I'll try harder.

And, a great CD I bought the other day. *points to music*
Thought I ran onto you down on the street
Then it turned out only to be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and took a different path
I remember the face
But I cant recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Seem s that she disappeared with out a trace
did she ever marry old what's his face
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and took a different path
I remember the face 
But I cant recall the name
Now I wonder how whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless
She's in my head
From so long ago

(Go, Go, Go, Go..)

And in the darkest
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time

Forgetting you, but not the time

It's amazing
How you make your face just like a wall
How you take your heart and turn it off
How I turn my head and lose it all

It's unnerving
How just one move puts me by myself
There you go just trusting someone else
Now I know I put us both through hell

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
I'm not saying we ever had the right to hold on
I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

It's aggravating
How you threw me on and you tore me out
How your good intentions turn to doubt
The way you needed time to sort it out

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
I'm not saying we ever had the right to hold on
I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

Tell me is that how it's going to end
When you know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
And the one you're leaving out

The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

"event","<lj-cut text=""To whom it may concern""> All last summer, in case you don't recall,
I was yours and you were mine
Forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?

And all the lines you wrote to me were lies
Months roll past the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily

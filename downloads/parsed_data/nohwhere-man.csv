The US Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is a legal right across the United States.
It means the 14 states with bans on same-sex marriage will no longer be able to enforce them.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the plaintiffs asked ""for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.""



Finally. The shouting isn't over, of course. Won't be as long as the mostly xtian mobs don't understand that -their- god isn't the deity of the rest of us. It would be too much to hope that they realize what they do in the name of their god is similar to what the Taliban, Boku Haram, and the like do. Maybe not always a violent, but still the same."

My rant of the day, well, one of them:
It's really silly how many western/temperate cultures think of summer as <i>starting</i> in late june. It's a modern convention. Any agrarian society will tell you that mid june is the height of summer (hence historically calling the summer Solstice ""mid-summers day""). It's as bad as calling Yule the start of winter; anyone that's been in a real winter knows that's it's full-on cold by that time.

What's worse is all the people that say things like ""bla-season-bla has OFFICIALLY started"". Stuff and nonsense, I say to that.

Let's call things as they really are in temperate climes- spring from early Feb to early May, summer from May to August, autumn/fall from august to November, and winter from then until February again. If you're in the southern hemisphere, please invert this message."

""Terrorist's tiny victim"" or ""Bomb's tiny victim"". <i>Terror</i> (a state of intense fear) had nothing to do with his death, but <i>terrorists</i> did. In the last 12 years, we've had a gradual shift in the media from using the word terrorist (from terrorism: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion) to simply terror. A terror didn't make any bombs, a terrorist did, and terror (fright) probably hasn't killed anyone involved, a bomb did.

Buffalo Goths
(tune: Buffalo Gals aka, New York Gals, etc, possibly by John Hodges, 1844)

Chorus (usually between verses):
 Buffalo Goth, won't you come out tonight,
 Come out tonight, come out tonight.
 Buffalo Goth, won't you come out tonight
 And dance by the light of the moon.


As I was walking down the street,
Down the street, down the street,
All dressed in black I chanced to meet,	
A girl with dark blue hair.

I stopped her and we had some talk,
Had some talk, had some talk,
But her skirt covered up the whole sidewalk
And left no room for me.

I asked her if she'd have a dance,
Have a dance, have a dance,
I thought that I might have a chance
To shake a foot with her.

I danced with a boi with a hole in his stockin',
And his heel kept a-knockin', and his toes kept a-rockin'
I danced with a boi with a hole in his stockin'
And we danced by the light of the moon.

I danced all night with a bottle in my hand
A bottle in my hand, a bottle in my hand
I danced all night with a bottle in my hand
And oozed to the promised land

The pretty boys, we're comin' out tonight,
We're comin' out tonight, we're comin' out tonight,
O yes, pretty boys, we're all out tonight,
To dance by the light of the moon.

Today was the first day out with the used kite I bought last fall, and (a) it works, (b) after 5 months off I can still fly one. Since the wind was a bit slack, I got a lot of practice in relaunching... I'm also a bit sore...but not badly. One of the features of Crown Beach is that part of the shore is practically flat, so when the tide is out, there's hundreds of feet of sand. I spent most of the hour and a half out there in knee-deep water. Still need to get an airpump and a board, but one I can borrow and the other can wait until I practice some more. The only downside is that I have to work this week :), but since the new job is Not Sucking, that's not too bad (and the $13k of new equipment I asked for has been approved)."

It's especially not easy when the wind keeps changing and the kits just drops like a stone (on strings), but that was happening to everyone. The instructor was Not Happy with it. Didn't quite get up on the board, but it was a good day anyway, and way too much to cram into 5 hours. Will likely have another go at it next weekend. One of the catches, other than wind and time, is that you can rent everything <i>but</i> the kite, so you either buy a kite or take lessons. It's also very tiring.

Did learn that the bay water is significantly warmer than the ocean, it was almost 70 degrees! (the coast was about 58...) But I'll stick with the wet suit anyway, hypothermia not being a good thing."

"event","Finally, a decision:

http://www.mercurynews.com/samesexmarriage/ci_15677141?nclick_check=1

A San Francisco federal judge today struck down California's ban on same-sex marriage, concluding that it tramples on the equal rights of gay and lesbian couples and setting the stage for an appeal that appears destined for the U.S. Supreme Court.

""Moral disapproval alone is an improper basis on which to deny rights to gay men and lesbians,"" the judge wrote. ""The evidence shows conclusively that Proposition 8 enacts, without reason, a private moral view that same-sex couples are inferior to opposite sex couples.

""California is able to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples,"" Walker wrote, ""as it has already issued 18,000 marriage licenses to same-sex couples and has not suffered any demonstrated harm as a result.""


<lj-cut text=""From the decision (I just skipped to the end):"">

CONCLUSION
Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite sex couples are superior to same-sex couples. Because California has no interest in discriminating against gay men and lesbians, and because Proposition 8 prevents California from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide marriages on an equal basis, the court concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.

REMEDIES
Plaintiffs have demonstrated by overwhelming evidence that Proposition 8 violates their due process and equal protection rights and that they will continue to suffer these constitutional violations until state officials cease enforcement of Proposition 8. <i>California is able to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples</i>, as it has already issued 18,000 marriage licenses to same sex couples and has not suffered any demonstrated harm as a result, see FF 64-66; moreover, California officials have chosen not to defend Proposition 8 in these proceedings. Because Proposition 8 is unconstitutional under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, the court orders entry of judgment <i>permanently enjoining its enforcement</i>; prohibiting the official defendants from applying or enforcing Proposition 8 and directing the official defendants that all persons under their control or supervision shall not apply or enforce Proposition 8. The clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment without bond in favor of plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenors and against defendants and defendant-intervenors pursuant to FRCP 58.

(06-15) 17:47 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- As the trial over California's prohibition on same-sex marriage enters its final stage Wednesday, the ban's sponsors are urging the judge to go a step further and revoke state recognition of the marriages of 18,000 gay and lesbian couples who wed before voters passed Proposition 8.
[...]
Andrew Pugno, an attorney for Prop. 8's backers, said in an interview that the sponsors aren't asking Walker to nullify the 18,000 marriages, but only to rule that government agencies, courts and businesses no longer have to recognize the couples as married.

[or ""we can't say you should nullify them, we'd like you to, of course, we just want them to have no value""]"

Cataract Falls is a loooonnnggggg series of waterfalls feeding into Alpine Lake on Mt Tamalpais. It's part of the water supply for Marin County. You drive west 8 miles from Fairfax (CA, not VA), then start hiking. The trail to the top is only about 1.4 miles, but it rises from 680' at the trailhead to something like 1400'(!) at the top. This includes approximately 525 steps...yes, I counted, but probably lost or gained some along the way.

But wow. Mountain streams cascading down steep hillsides, water tumbling over rocks, trees covered in moss, ferns, waterfalls from 1' to at least 20' high. No sound of cars or airplanes. Just wow. Only took about 220 pictures.... (userpic is one of them, must upload RSN)

<blockquote>The U.S. Supreme Court's camera blackout of the trial over same-sex marriage in California didn't faze two Los Angeles filmmakers, who - with the help of transcripts, bloggers and a corps of professional actors - have launched its re-enactment on YouTube.
[...]
The cast includes such Hollywood talents as Tess Harper and Adrienne Barbeau.
[...]
Veteran character actor Jack Laufer plays plaintiffs' attorney David Boies.
[...]
The filmmakers plan to post a new installment every two or three days and hope to finish by late February, Ireland said. So far, he said, the only feedback from trial participants has been some phone calls from lawyers and witnesses offering tips on how to portray them.

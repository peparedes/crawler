"event","I've had one week now of having one excellent class.  It's my Theater II class, and we've been writing monologues based on parent-child conflicts.  Some of the ideas that come out of their writing are heartbreaking, and would probably make for good Theater.  One girl essentially wrote a piece about a girl getting raped and then lying to her parents so that they wouldn't make her marry the man.  One kid wrote about sex being the alternative to getting attention from your parents.  Another girl wrote really well about her parents' eyes, and how she sees anger and hatred where she once saw love and safety.  I'm in love with this class!

Having one good class changes how I feel about my days.  I had at least one good class (and sometimes two) every quarter last year.  This year, I started off with so-so classes being as good as it got.  So this quarter, at least so far, I'm feeling much better about my job.  I don't need the whole day to go perfectly, but I do need that one group to really look forward to.  It could be all over by this coming week.  People go nuts around the holidays.  But at least I know I've got potential to feel extremely rewarded in my job again."

"event","The last time October 2nd was on a Sunday, I was a freshman in college.  I had spent Saturday night in Chicago for my cousin Dave's wedding, and got back early enough Sunday to study for a Physical Geography test I was supposed to have on Monday.  My roommate had essentially taken over the room with his electronic equipment and numerous friends coming in and out at all hours.  I decided it was safest to study in the library.

Before entering my room, I was already annoyed to hear that Jason was blasting the country music version of ""I Swear"" on his stereo.  I unlocked the door, entered, and noticed that Jason was lying in his recliner.  He looked like he was asleep.  Next I noticed that he had an athletic sock tied around his neck, and several folded up notes sat on top of his entertainment center.  I shouted his name a few times, but he didn't wake up.  I ran out of the room and started knocking on doors to get help.  A guy from down the hall untied the sock, and my RA called 911.

It took smelling salts to wake him up.  Jason's suicide attempt landed him in the hospital for a few days.  My friend Gabe spent that night in my room with me, but we were both pretty creeped out.  The next day, I moved over to the room next door.  The Dean of Students arranged for me to take my exam later.  Jason thanked me for ""saving his life"" when he came back to school.  He dropped out of school not long after and joined the school's custodial staff.  I have no idea where he is now."

"event","I happened to take an alternative route home from school today (because I missed my exit because I was playing with my sunroof...).  I ended up driving through downtown St. Paul, and taking Robert Street toward my little southern suburb.  As I neared my old neighborhood, I came upon the scene of an accident.  I saw an ambulence and some police cars.  Oh yeah, and in the middle of it all, I saw my uncle's van a bit smashed up in the back.  

He's okay, but his van has seen better days.  He was actually rear-ended, and the force of the collision caused him to rear-end the next guy up.  I NEVER EVER EVER go that way, and NEVER drive home anywhere NEAR as early as I did today, so it was very, very strange that I would happen upon this accident."

"event","Some talents are envied all over the land.  I don't know how many times I've heard people say, ""I sure wish I could sing,"" or, ""I wish I didn't dance like an awkward white boy.""  But other talents go mostly unobserved, and lay patiently waiting for a giant black dog to bark.

One thing I'm good at is flinching.

I know, I know.  Two for flinching, right?  You are all going to snap your wrist a half an inch from my face, draw an ""X"" on my shoulder with your index finger, and then punch me twice on that invisible X for flinching, right?  Because that is exactly what my middle school compatriots did, probably around twenty-five of them at once, when they discovered my hidden talent during lunch break in 8th grade.  Our principal noticed the mocking horde surrounding the crying boy (with purpling shoulders).  ""Get off of him!"" shouted my knight in shining bald spot.  Apparently he didn't know the rule of Two for Flinching.  And he was in the presence of a Master Flincher.

I never heard that anyone got in trouble from that episode, but I was never mobbed like that again.  Perhaps my classmates collectively realized that they punched me out of jealousy.  My reflexes, or at least my defense mechanisms, were the fastest in town.  I don't know if I was born with my flinching prowess, or if I developed it unwittingly in my adolescence.  Maybe my lightning-fast face and body jerks were a side-effect of the pneumonia I had when I was four.  Or maybe the telephone in my childhood home rang too loudly.  What I do know is if flinching were a school sport, I would have been state champion.  

I'd forgotten my high aptitude for flinching until recently, when I realized that my shirt got wet every time I went over to my friends Eric and Katherine's house.  Their shiny, black dog Moxie, who is largely Australian Shepherd, jumps up on me the moment I walk through the door.  And I flinch.  Every time Moxie greets me, I essentially have a full-body flinch.  It must look like she's administering shock treatments through her paws.  And these spasms only make her happier to see me, and more intent on giving me the greeting I deserve.  I've heard that animals sometimes have a sense of things that most humans do not.  They'll see ghosts or know that an earthquake is coming.  Moxie is like that too, only her sixth sense involves my special talent.  Whenever I come over, Moxie knows that she is in the presence of flinching genius.  She jumps up on me and shrilly yelps out her recognition.  I think she is just trying to come as close to my genius as she can.  Either that, or she's trying to herd me.

Thankfully, Moxie has a short attention span.  With a cow's sholder, pig's snout, or other tasty animal carcass treat between her paws, she'll typically leave me be for most of my visit with Eric and Katherine.  But every now and then, just to reassure herself that I've still got it, she'll look up at me and let out an eardrum-shattering BARK.  I've noticed that these barks usually come just as I'm taking a drink of water.  I've also noticed that they subside when half of the water from my glass is soaked into my shirt due to a double axel flinch.  That dog really appreciates my talent.

Jealous?"

Grrr....  

The short story is that I was in Austin, Texas, for a few days visiting friends, followed by a week-long stint as kidsitter for cousins ranging in ages from 10-17.  The heat in Austin was oppressive (and I knew it would be, but I was there for someone's birthday so couldn't do much about the dates...), but I enjoyed the time I had there with old friends.  I haven't fully processed my time in Iowa, which is one reason it is hard to write about.  Overall, I feel rewarded.  I felt that the kids were good, they mostly listened to me, they seemed to not hate having me around, and I got to know them better.  I want to be a parent someday.  Sooner than later, actually.  Would anyone on my friends list like to have my baby???  Or maybe I could just adopt...."

"event","I have a reprieve from Miss Beans departure into the great beyond.  She perked up amazingly well on Saturday. Did a total 180. I called the vet and asked what I should do she told me I should ride it out and enjoy the small gift I've been given.  It may last a couple of days or weeks or months. But enjoy it until she takes a turn again.  The vet gave me her number and I'm to give her a call when this happens.  I am going to enjoy the time I have with the little girl and continue love her and spoil her rotten.  Thank you all for your support through this difficult time. She really was doing that badly I thought it was time for her. You will all most likely hear from me again. But for right now thanks for listening and being there for me. Bean is family to me and means much to me.  Thanks."

"event","I am about to do the hardest thing in my life. The cute kitty you see in the picture has been in my life since she was a kitten. And now it has come time time to say goodbye. She has kidney failure and the vet thinks she has cancer. I cannot afford all the tests to confirm the cancer; but even if she did she is too old and frail to be put through anymore. She has stopped eating and I cannot do much for her, I've tried. So instead of having her suffer I must say goodbye my friend and pray that she finds a better place beyond what there is here. I do believe there is a better place, I do believe in Heaven and I know when my time comes too I'll meet all the people and critters that I've had to say goodbye to so far. May God keep you and bless you Miss Bean. You've been a wonderful friend, never judgmental, always there, and always listening to my crap when I needed someone to talk to. I love you you cute ball of fluff! You are my little girl, always!

"event","Hello it has been such a long time and so much has happened.  I'm currently sitting at home working with my neurologist to get my meds to where he feels they should be and I feel they should be as well.  I currently feel that too much has been taken away now but we'll see.  Balancing meds is a tightrope act and that is not happening yet.  But when it does I have to find a different job even if it starts as part time.  My Doc. said that this is now a chronic condition for the rest of my life.  I am trying to get a hold of him today to ask about any disability or working from home programs or something.  I really know nothing about this at all.  I have hit frustration  many moons ago.  Some day I'll cry but I can't yet until I quit fighting that's all I know.  Anyway that's whats going on and will keep going on from now on.  I will now have good patches and bad patches I am told well, if that didn't burst my bubble I don't what did.  So that is that for now.  May you healthy ones stay healthy! Love to you all!"

"event","Well during the WONDERFUL colonoscopy they took out a polyp.  They sent it to be analyzed and it came back as cancer.  The lump on my chest is just a cyst.  I am going to the colon Dr. tomorrow and they will let me know what exactly will happen during the surgery and what not.  At least the colon cancer is just that, colon.  My breast cancer will not have to be upgraded to a level 4.  Thank God!  That is my exciting Thanksgiving news how's yours?"

"event","Well they found a little lump on my chest that I think might be a cyst.  And there is a spot in my colon that looks suspicious and I am having my colonoscopy next week on Tuesday and the lump removed on Wednesday.  Loads of fun! (Dripping sarcasm.)  So let us hope that the colon is a polyp and the lump on the chest is a cyst and we can all go back to breathing normally, shall we?"

"event","Wow, when I looked at my journal I realized how long it has been since I last posted!  After the surgery I was informed from the pathology report that the cancer is gone.  :)  I have been back to work for about 6 weeks now and am getting used to it again.  I do have tennis elbow from repetitive motion though and have to wear a brace.  I am trying to keep busy and not get too tired out at the same time.  
     
My neurologist is still trying to get my pills ironed out so I will be seizure free and not over medicated at the same time.  Otherwise not too much else is going on in this little corner of the world.
    
I take that last sentence back Brad is going back to school!  Whoo-hoo!  I will also be going back for my bachelors at the end of December.  Otherwise like I said not too much else is happening.  Take care you all!"

OK Tracy you get to give Brian some heck for not signing my card.  I looked for his signature and it was not there.  :(  Just joking Brian!  Really thank you all for signing it, it is nice to be thought of at a time like this.  One can feel alone at times.
I'm going to try some beef garlic Chinese food now, let's see how that sits!  I sure miss food!
I hope to see you all after the 13th I am getting antsy to go back to work!"

eggs scrambled with cheese and ham, with one piece of wheat toast and butter!  Heaven!  I have been eating bananas 
and flax seed muffins and drinking 100% apple juice for quite awhile now.  Well 2 days anyway.  It is so 
hard to get my appetite back, and my thirst too.  Constant nausea and headaches.  And for someone that likes to eat
well this is torture.  Nausea sucks!"

"event","Well I have a fantastic head smashing headache.  I did nap to see if that would help it go away and it did for a bit.  Only while I was sleeping....  so whatever the f* this is I am not amused and it can quit now.  I do not have all my life to sleep away, I do have some things to finish up yet.  Like my school work.  I am in my last week to get stuff done before I start one last class to get my associates.  I will start homework and see just what happens.  I will get two pieces done today and then two tomorrow and then one daily up to Saturday.  Then I will be caught up.  Way too much to do.

Dana Reeve died!  She is too young to die!  She is only 3 years older than I am!  Kirby I can understand.  The poor man let himself go.  Dana fought, she did not want to die from cancer.  I have other women to look up to I know.  But it is still hard seeing this happen, so close to my age; way to young to go.  A moment of silence for Christopher and his wife Dana.

"event","I believe the above sentence says it all.  I am able to eat a bit more today but nothing is stopping the nausea.  No vomiting just nausea.  I went to the 	oncologists office today and got a shot which they told me will cause me pain in all of my large joints tomorrow.  Oh Boy!  What new fresh hell is being cooked up now? Apparently this will keep me healthy and able to function in public without getting sick.  I believe it is growing new stem cells in me and all the good stuff the chemo has killed off. It is not growing the bad stuff though.  I was told plain tylenol will stop the pain but if it didn't to call the oncologists' and they will take care of it from there.  
I had two scrambled eggs with cheese and it did not taste too bad at all.  Yesterday when I had the chicken noodle soup that tasted like fish; well that left something to be desired.  :p  Let's see what tomorrow brings shall we?"

Brad needs to go out and pick up some ensure and other necessities.  the only thing I am taking in is water and even that is sitting precariously.

Not what happened mind you; like he almost expected me to do something to myself.  Turkey!  Since it is stitched in I only pulled it a half inch out.   And in my conversation with the nurse at the doctors office it is not uncommon that these tubes get pulled upon.  Gah!  I'm better now but sore, and I tell you I can't wait till I'm through being sore!  My sis called and told me about this lady that she knows that had breast cancer.  She had a stage IV cancer and it was fast growing.  Now after Chemo treatments and occasional radiation treatments she has been cancer free for 6 years.  I want to be cancer free for at least 40 more years!  It sounds like I will have a pretty good chance.  By the way thanks for talking to me last night K. I really appreciate it.    :)"

"event","Pathology has not got back to me yet.  I am so very upset.  Why do  they do this?  They are not the ones with cancer!  I want to be able to move to the next step!  My schoolwork is suffering because of my surgery I am not able to get assignments in on time and my teachers are concerned.  I have always had a 4.0 but if gets lower so be it!  I will not flunk but I will not have the standards that I usually have. 
 The pain I have bothers me too much; I need to speak with my doctor and see if this is common.  I am not a good patient.  I called the Doctors office to see what the path report is today. (They said they would call me yesterday!)  Once again they said they would call me later!  Bastards!  So I will start my schoolwork and try to keep my mind on other things.  I feel good enough to type at least; my right arm cannot be used for too long or it starts to hurt under the arm.  I still have no feeling under my armpit and the back of my arm but at least it doesn't bother the fingers anymore.  So I think I will have Brad call and tell them that I need to know my what path report says while he is at home.  If it is bad I want someone here with me.  I will let you all know what is happening when I get the results."

"event","Brads' friend had a wife that had cancer and he has offered to be of support to him and I, which I think is very nice.  I haven't received my pathology report back yet from the surgery so I do not know what type(s) of treatment I will be having.  I do know one thing; when this friend wrote to Brad he told him about the levels of pathology.  There are three and three is the worst.  His wife had a three all across the board.  This is what he wrote.  ""If it is cancerous, it could be aggressive or not. I'd have to pull ______'s path report to recall what the three categories were, but I know they were graded from 0 to 3 and hers were 3 on all counts or a nine overall (max score it could be)"" 
 Let us hope that I do not have a three across the board or even a three at all.  Brad's friends' wife died.  I'm not ready to do that yet.  Yet another thing to worry about and quite frankly I'm tired of worrying.  I have a ways to go but I have a life to lead and I want to lead that life.  Prayers are definitely appreciated at this juncture.  No 3's!"

"event","I have news from the surgical consultation today.  My surgeon Dr. Ogren stated that she recommended a lumpectomy for me.  There will be a dye injected into the site and she will take a look to see if it goes to certain lymph nodes, if it does some may have to be removed.  After the surgery we will be looking at a few days recovery time, which is good.  Then after the recovery time; depending on the pathologists report, the terms of the treatment will be discussed.  I will either have radiation or chemotherapy or both.  I feel that the chemo will be the hardest of the treatment options.  I know the doctor stated that with younger women chemo seems to hit harder than it does the older ladies.  I am hoping that all I will need is radiation but we will see what the outcome is.  The surgery is slated for this Thursday by the way.  I wanted to get it done as soon as possible.  I can't wait to get these poisoned cells out of my body!  If she offered the surgery today I would have said OK.  :)"

He knows what kind of cancer I have, but not the size of it, or where it all is.  He needs this information to be able to treat it effectively.  When I see the surgeon this coming Tuesday the 7th I will be informed what my options are.  Such as whether or not to have one or both breasts removed a lumpectomy and so on.  So when I know more I will post again."

He stated that it is one that is treatable, which is good as opposed to the other kind.  I have an appointment on the first of February  at 10AM.  This is where I'll get the dirt on what will happen.  So wish me luck and pray that there will be no cancer elsewhere in my body because they do have to check a few other spots as well.  Oh joy."

Funds are low.  So I decided to go without for a week or two and sent money to the Red Cross and the HSUS to help both the people and the animals.  I feel somewhat better having adjusted my little corner of the world now.
And on an even crummier note I went to a wedding this weekend and before I went I tried ALL of my dress clothes on and NONE of them fit!  Time for a diet I think.  Now is that depressing or what?"

We all had a good walk and then went (sans Adam) to the energy expo held at the fairgrounds in the grandstand.   Lots of free stuff and information was to be had.  That's how I found out about the greenhouse in Amery.  I still have one more coupon for buy anything and get a free pack of perennials.

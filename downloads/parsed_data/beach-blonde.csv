I am a johnny depp lover 
I am a benny and joon lover

"event","i cant take it all in. Its just to much, the dream, the signs, everything. Its just to hard to deal with. Ill update this when im feeling better. Until then

adeu
from fair juliet
 
i had a dream he[chris ] was my husband and we were going to see the play at my school and we were the same age as now, and i was a bit skinnier
and he was holding my hand and he wasnt wearing a shirt

 and we were kissing and holding hands
 and we went downstairs to where the payphones are like were the buses come
and there was a petefile after me and we hid under a table
and he told me im gunna be ok
and we kissed and the petefile saw me and chris took me and we ran down the hall away
from the guy
 and we turned into a room
and the guy locked it on us and he was inside
and he was gunna kill chris and rape and sexually torture me
and then chris was screaming and trying to get out of the room
 and the guy was holding weird scissor type things that he was going to rip my unmentionables apart with, and next to him was a ragedy old fat guy in a bed who was waiting to rape me
and finally chris got the door open and we ran down the hall and outside
 and then we started kissing and hugging
 and then we started having sex
 but i could feel it
 like it wasnt a dream where you can only see it
 i could feel EVERYTHING
and then today i thought it was just a dream but everytime i thought about him my heart started beating reallllllllly fast and i couldnt breathe
 and i saw him
 and my eyes started tearing
 and then in gym
 we played volleyball against his team
 and i stood right across from him and he looked at me and i started histerically crying
 and i never cry in school
 and then today after school i was telling kristen
 and he walked by
i like couldnt breathe
 and then in rehearsal today at like nine
 i went in the gym bc its across the hall and i didnt have a number for lyk 20 min
and he was playing basketball and it was 830 at night
 and i started HISTERICAL worse then ever crying
 and thnk god colleen was at rehearsal
 so i talked to her
 but im so scared to go to sleep
 i dont wanna dream
 ive never had a dream so intense
 like i felt everything
 i felt him holding my hand 
kissing me
i felt him touching me
 i felt him pushing against me
i felt him in me
i felt him..his skin, his body, his hands on my hands,
his cheek against mine, i felt it all.
i know it sounds disgusting but its true
 its so scary

and then all i remember is we died together. and we loved each other. but we died together.

heres what i got from a dream dictionary:
rape
Something or someone is jeopardizing your self-esteem and emotional well-being. You feel that someone or something is being forced upon you. 
sex
You need to be more receptive and incorporate aspects of your dream sex partner into your own character. Alternatively and a more direct interpretation of the dream, may be your libido's way of telling you that it's been too long since you have had sex. It may indicate repressed sexual desires and your needs for physical and emotional love.
love
Dreaming of love of being in love, suggests intense feelings carried over from a waking relationship. It implies happiness and contentment with what you have and where you are in life. On the other hand, you may not be getting enough love in your daily life. 
crush
Dreaming that you have a crush on somebody, is a literal reflection of your attraction and fascination for that person. Seeing your crush in your dream, represents your current infatuation with him or her. 
torture
   Dreaming that you are being tortured indicates that you are feeling victimized or helpless in some relationship or situation."

but biology...i have no clue what im doing..
math i cant remember if it meant my life..
and dont even ask about other stuff like...remember you have to 
go to extra help for math or bio today...id be like what r u talking about.
I can remember lins in drama, and arrands i have to run, or exactly howmuch money my mom owes me, but not school...nuhuh.

i wont name the ones who do, or don't.

But you can tell if I open up to you, with my heart.
I open to MANY, but few i really pour my feelings out to.
But i feel as if the ones i can really pour myself into..they shall
stay.
But those who i can't..then maybe I should try to avoid them from 
unloved confrontation.

eiffel tower pictures
eiffel tower paintings
everything french will be in my room ;-)
but i was listening to peter pan and thinking about how much
i love pirates and stuff like imagination
and i was thinking i could do my room like the underground burrow in 
Peter Pan 2003, with vines hanging everywhere and flowers and trees painted on the wall and crap like that
i just dont know what to do with my room

but if i did do it french, then i could change my mind to doing Peter pa, or island[another idea] easier bc all id have to do is paint over and some other renovations..im just so boggled. The other thing is only have 4 more years in this house.

dream answer me...

ok so im like craving Moulin Rouge like TRIPLE ACTION OMFG.
When i first saw it at melissas with alaura i remember they said ""brace yourself this movie is sooo addicting""

And lately for the past year ive been getting so attached to movies and heres the evaluation:

i want to be in a fairy tale...ive got more imagination then this world can hold and ive got to let go of it and let it flow. I still dont know what i want to do when i ""grow up""
you never grow up though, you just add more expeiriences to your personality...you still get mad when you have to share an ice cream cone, or you still want to go into your mothers arms and cry because you got a papercut, you still have everything from when you were 4, 5, 6...you just got labeled a bigger number so you think you have to act bigger, and you dont, but its so engraved in our minds. 
i want to make movies, to make fairy tales come true, like big fish, i could see myself telling my kid little stories and never telling them the truth just so they think theres more in store for them then tv, computers, and bitchy people in the world. Maybe thats why i want to go to europe, and travel, i hate things being the same everyday. things have to change...my life is a pattern school skating mall hbriding and i need more then that, i do travel some places but not far enough that its so different..if i dont get away from Smithtown im gunna blow and explode...and fireworks will form bc im so magical..i can fly..and i can be a mermaid

I need change                                   tim burton your my hero.

"event","Mommy was nice enough to bring me home an article dated DEC 20th BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT. about Peter Pan, yet it was so dreadful. I read it over, and it remarked ""And in place of the usual innocence, there's palpable sexual chemistry between the commitment-phbic peter, Played by the bare chested hunky-american Jeremy, and Wendy portrayed by a 13 year old british newcomer, Rachel Hurd-Wood.'The camera displays an obsession with the enormous permently wet lips of wendy' wrote film critic John walsh, In londons The Independent."" On the other hand they did argue the title of the article, ""I dont think there is anything creepy about first love, I think it is one of the most beautiful things about the play[originally written by J.M barrie in 1905] Wendy is also intrigued by Cpt. Hook, and he knows this and plays off it. I really wanted it to be the original story and not all sweet and light. I think it is a surprise to people because they are so used to the 1953 version which did remove all darkness. We want to protect kids from the world, but they are sharp. They can see whats around them and they know there are dark things out there- and want stories to explain those things to them""

I was mostly disgusted about how the writers of this article really put the movie down before it was in theatres, discouraging people to go see it with their children, and i dont think it was their place. I do think it is a beautiful story about love and admitting to your weakness, and i also agree Rachel and Jeremy had so much sexual tension, and that they in turn may be true loves to each other. I dont think any kids could act that good without it being natural, as if you truely did love them. It is my most favorite movie-ranks same to Pirates Of the Caribbean, and it makes me cry everytime i see it. But i dont beleive it has any sex in it that children, 5,6 years of age, would rather notice.

        Love <33

     Who said mermaids are nice?
                      Who said indians dont live in teepees?

Peter Pan- Defys the rules.

"event","Dear Journal,

wow. very surprising. went to the mall today, and to my fucking surprise dave was walking in front of me, like always putting me in a stalker position. so i looked and he was holding hands with a girl. the girl i reckoned to be jessica his long lost ex, fancied kristinas haircut and body. I contamplated if it was her or not...but the girl who was engulfed in daves hand walked much differently then kristina. and kristina would never wear grey tight pants...but i still felt as if it were my best friend. I got home and thank you god alaura told me it was jessica. thank god. im totally over him but, just the thought of my best friend going with my old obsession was ravishingly terrifying. I must say my heart skipped a beat today. Birthday is in 3 days. I have to say i FANCY money..hint hint...

first of all, xmas sucked ok, i got like nothing! NOTHING! no xbox my mom said i have to wait  like 2 weeks until she gets ""money"" and i got a portable cd player and gloves, gloves, gloves. My cousin didnt even ask for xbox, she got it without a fuss, a louis vuitton bag, a storefull of jewelry, abercrombie sweatshirt[not that i dont have one =\] games, and toys, and winsor pilates[what i begged for]and everything her heart disired and more. Ok that kinda pissed me off that she didnt even make an effort to make a christmas list and beg her mother everyday and she got whatever she wanted. I cryed about that and yelled at my mom for not being fair in that morgan got everything and i got gloves gloves and more gloves. 
ok so im going to new hampshire and im full throttle happy about it and so i found out were goin on a ferry that cuts the ride in half WOOHOO! and my cousin morgan is goin', the one with the xbox, and the world, and so im like all happy, goin to new hampshire, fireplace, lake side, snowboarding, shopping in the cute bookstore, eating cheeseburgers at marty's, yay! So this morning morgan called and was like ""lets go skating!"" so we went and shes like wait up ill be there at 12 because im going to pick up my skis at oakdaleso im  like ok. And she calls back and ofcourse im like gramma i got the phone..and gramma sits on the phone while im trying to talk to morgan, and so i yell ""gramma hang the phone up! hang it up!"" and shes all like dont yell at me!  and im like yeah whateva! and so morgans like you have to call this number to make reservations on the ferry...and im all like ok..and i gave my mom the number to call and i got off the phone with morgan and my mom was calling and gramma comes downstairs and starts yelling her brains out at me like shes gunna commit homicide! and so mommy couldnt hear the reservation person so she asked them if she could call them back. So after gramma yells her brains out at me and im  about to commit suicide we finally leave for the rinx. I talk to Uncle arthur and im like ""Why didnt you just make reservations for us because its not like we wont pay you back, and we told you we were going on the ferry?"" and Uncle arthur is VERY cheap if you didnt know already. and hes like ""Well it cost a lot of money and i had to charge it on my credit card so i didnt want you guys not to go and i have to pay"" And im like yea, whateva. So my mom picks me up and shes like i couldnt get through to the ferry reservation...so im sooooo sad and mad and angry...and she said ill try again later. and so i went to beans's's's house. And it was fun, and then my mommy picked me up and said we didnt get the ferry! and so i called up morgan and yelled at her, and then shes like all sad that im not going on the ferry with her which is equally dissapointing since she gets sea sick ...mwuahahahahha.I got off the phone and started crying... i didnt get anything for xmas, and now im not going on the ferry!? and i live for ships..and im not going on the ferry and i really want to? It seems like morgan is just getting everything without a fuss, or worry, and im not getting anything... and so my mom is like [phew finally to the point of this long story]...""not everything works out"" and i said ""well it seems nothing is for me"".


i dont know if im going to new hampshire. maybe, maybe not.

But, I've decided that I am going to wear it all the time now, lol, it's a great pick up line! Everytime I've worn it I've been kissed. Granted, the first time I wore it all old men kissed me, lol, but last night a young guy did. I was doing my laundry when I heard a knock on the window outside. I look and it's this guy wanting me to open the door for him. So I go and open the door and he's like, ""Thanks!"" and I smile and say ""You're welcome"" and I start walking away. Like 2 seconds later he says, ""wait!"" and pulls me back and KISSES ME! lolol. At first I totally forgot that I was wearing the shirt and I was like ""WOW! this kid is really grateful for me opening the door, jeez!"" hahaha. And then the boy goes ""Well, I'm not Irish, but I'm Russian"" and he smiles. And I'm like, still in shock kinda, so I just smile back and reach for the doorknob of the laundry room.

<b>1. - First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady</b>

During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one:
""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""
Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?
I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.
""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say ""hello.""
I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


<b>2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain</b>

One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man
took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab. She seemed t o be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A special note was attached... It read:
""Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away... God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others.""
Sincerely,
Mrs. Nat King Cole.


<b>3. - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve</b>

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.
""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.
""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.
The little boy pulled is hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.
""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.
""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied.
The little boy again counted his coins.
""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.
The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, was one quarter, two dimes and five pennies. You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had
to have enough left to leave her a tip.



<b>4. - Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our Path</b>

In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing
and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand! 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.


<b>5. - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts</b>

Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a
deep breath and saying, ""Yes I'll do it if it will save her."" As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, ""Will I start to die right away?"" Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

Now you have 2 choices.
1. Ignore this post, or
2. Repost it so other people can read it.

I hope that you will choose No. 2 and remember.

Most importantly... ""Work like you don't need the money, sing like no one is listening, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching.""

""Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away""

I feel like I'm loosing my back-home friends. Little by little the phone calls are becoming less and less, and the IMs few and far between. I've been having a rough time here in Tallahassee. Everyone is transferring. Michelle (my roomie) is. Nicole was talking about it. And about 3-4 others are too. Its hard to get pumped up about being here when everyone hates it. :( I just wish I could see me puppy and my kitties. I miss my mommy, too.

I had a really fun night tonight. Nicole and I were listening to music so loud in my car with the windows down. And it almost felt like I was back home. :) We went to Applebees, haha, and it was nice to actually sit down and have a nice dinner without being interrupted. 

The weather here has been really nice. The mornings and nights are cool. I cannot wait for winter to roll in. And while the afternoons are still sunny and miserable, it's beginning to feel alot like fall. 

I got a new fishy today. His name is Dr. Erikson, after my paleobiology teacher who I have a HUGE crush one. haha. But, so people dont think I am a complete weirdo, I can call him Doc, D.E. or any other cute nick name. Nicole and I are good at making up nicknames, haha. ""Chad"" lol.

At the pet store where I bought my little fishy friend we played with the puppies. I saw an Australian Shepherd puppy that was just like Abby. I played with her for a while and it made me happy. I also played with the cutest little Chihuahua. I have decided that when I get my own place I am getting one. I love them. Theyre such little killers :)

8am classes tomorrow suck. Luckily I aced my paleobiology test (96%, I only missed one question!!!!!) so I dont have to go take the re-take. yesssss.

My dad is going to come visit me the weekend of November 5th! I bought him and I good tickets for the last home football game of the year, NC State vs FSU. :) I miss my parents so much. I hardly get to talk to them ever since they moved to NC. Because the new house is in the mountains they dont get any reception on their cell phones. The only time I get to talk to them is when they are in town. :( I cant wait to see the new house. I'm excited.

Things have been going alright lately. I've been sick, which pretty much sucks big time. I have a history midterm on Monday, which is scaring me shitless. I have a MAJOR problem with skipping class. I never go. Well, actually, I do go. The only classes I have problems going to are History and Biology. BUT! Biology you dont have to go to, it's a waste of a class. I really should go to History. I like the class, but it's at 8am, and I have a BIG problem waking up in the mornings. Plus, Michelle and I are on different schedules, so on the days I have to get up early, she doesnt, which means lights are on and what not. No biggie though, my main problem is getting up. I miss my mom being my alarm clock. :( 

Heres some good news though! I wrote my history professor an email telling him how sorry I was that I missed class because I was sick. I also asked him about getting my graded report back (because he handed them back the day I missed.) He wrote me back such a cute email. I love older men (even though he's not THAT old). In the email he told me that I was only ONE of THREE in the ENTIRE class to get an A on my history paper. A fucking A! There are like, 100 kids in the class too! It's quite the feather in my cap if I do say so myself. I wrote that paper the night before it was due, at like 2 in the morning. I was so happy. :) 95%....who does that!?

Tomorrow is the start of ""Parents Weekend"" and my arent coming. But it doesnt bother me much...I'd rather them come when I could have more one on one time. Michelle's parents are coming, which means I have to clean my room because, let's face it, it's a disaster zone. I have been putting it off for SO long, and now that I'm sick it has to be done, WTF. I'm so unlucky. 

I have been buying DVDs like a madwoman. What's new there, though.

Tonight is going to suck. Everyone wants me to go to this frat party but I cant go. Its Thursday! Why does everything fun happen on Thursdays?! I have to clean my room, do laundry, STUDY FOR MY MIDTERM THAT I HAVENT EVEN BEGUN TO STUDY FOR, and not to mention I'm sick. PLUS I have class tomorrow at 8am and Lord knows that if I dont get home until 3 I wont be going to class the next morning. 

I havent been going to intern at the elementary school either. I've been such an irresponsible bum. I need to kcik my ass into gear. I hate all this crap.

I have a headache and I feel like I'm writing a novel.

On Tuesday I went to a party with Michelle and some girls from my dorm. I really shouldnt have gone considering I had to get up at 6:30am the following day for this stupid dorm thing. I felt so dumb at that party, so out of place. Everyone there has done so much more than me, including some hardcore drugs. I dont know, I felt really dumb and uncomfortable and all I wanted to do was go back to the dorm and sleep. I hate beer. Blah. We ended up leaving at like 3am. I missed my mandatory thing that morning because I was exhausted. Oh well, I didnt really want to go to it anyway. :)

But yea, I feel like such a prude. :(

Yesterday was much better. We went to lunch with a bunch of girls at the Park Avenue Diner. Afterwords I came home and passed out so I could be fun that night. At around 8 we went out to Moe's for dinner. Let me just say that I love Moe's. I had the best fucking burrito there. Yum. Afterwords we went to this hooka bar. I loved that place. It was such a chill atmosphere. We had to take our shoes off and we got into these little boxes with pillows and rugs and stuff and relaxed. We got strawberry hooka which was yummy. I had a really good time there. 

After the hooka bar we got some icecream from Coldstone. I've been spending alot of money, I need to stop. lol. 

Michelle and Ashely went back to the house that had the party the night before. Kelsie, Meredith and I went back to the dorms. We ran into some hardcore christians having a jam session on Landis Green and we went there to check it out. I think I might go to check out some churches with her this weekend. Maybe I'll meet some nice people. :) I like Kelsie, we had fun singing in my car.

Meredith came over and we watched Mean Girls. She left at 1 and I chilled around the room until around 3 when Michelle came home. She is seriously so funny. I love her. haha. She was telling me about her time at the party. I swear, her and I are very alike, except im the good version of her. I love it. 

I love Ryan Watzel. :) He IM's me and I think its awesome that he's actually keeping in touch with me, unlike everyone else from that group.

Anyway. I cant believe Coral Springs is being directly hit by the ""hurricane"" and I'm not even there for it. Have fun with that one guys. ;)

More pictures coming soon."

"event","I love FSU. Well, at least thus far. I got here on Saturday morning and moved in at around 8am. My parents helped me unload and then they took me to lunch. They left shortly after and left me alllll alone. I set up my half of the room and whatnot. The next day Michelle, my room mate, came. I love her. I am soooo lucky. I feel like I've known her for sooo long, but its only been 3 days. We already have inside jokes and we really see eye to eye on alot of things. Her parents just left today actually, and they were so nice. I had the biggest crush on her 16 year old brother, haha. Total babe. Oh yea. 

We spent alot of time making our room awesome, and it is. The pictures I have to show you guys are when it was messy, even though it still is. :) Anyway. I also love my suite mates. Their sophomores and they lived here last year. The one is just like me, maybe a little more cooky if you can imagine. She loves RENT, is obsessed with DVDs, like me, and SHE BOUGHT LIFE AS WE KNOW IT ON DVD!!!! Jessica and I were like the only ones who watched it. I cant wait to get it. I have to get Roseanne and Boy Meets World too. And the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. I need it, and I love it. 

This week I have ""Camp Cawthon"" which is where we have stupid little meetings and activities to make us learn to work as a team. Bullshit. I've already found the love of my life. His name is Aaron and he's from Texas. So hot. Its ridiculous. :) I have to wake up at 6:30 tomorrow to do a ropes course at the Reservation. (its a lake side property FSU owns where we can rent boats and shit.) Anyway, I'm not looking forward to it.

So far I love college. I have a feeling that Michelle is going to corrupt me though, haha, even more than I already am. She has a bong, has so many fun drinking games and what not. I love her. <3

Today is my goodbye with Carol. We're getting icecream at 2. I wish we had time to hang out a little more on her last day, but she has family obligations and what not. And of course I'm premenstrual just as all of my friends are leaving, go figure.

I had my last day of work yesterday and I couldnt be more happy. I get to sleep in!!!! Well...at least until 8:30, haha.

"event","Ok, so I know I've been neglecting my LJ, but I've honestly been sooooo busy. I work everyday 8-4 and when I'm not working I'm probably with Carol, lol. I've been trying to spend time with my friends before I leave. I dont think people realize that once I leave the chances of seeing me again are <i>slim</i>. I wont be driving all the way down to Coral Springs, especially when my family is all the way up in North Carolina. 

I've been kinda sad lately because I feel like I am always trying to please others and do nice things for them, but when it comes to me I come last on their agendas. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a filler in peoples schedules because they have nothing better to do. 

I've been packing like a mad woman, and after my surprise visit to Hannah in Gainesville I'm getting even more psyched for school. Even though the time I chose to visit her was definitely not the best time, I would do it a million times over just to see her reaction again. It was classic...but not AS classic as Space Mountain. Right Hannah? Right Carol? hahaha. 

Last night I stayed up late putting all of my pictures into little albums. Its crazy to see how much things have changed in just a year. I mean, I havent even talked to 1/2 of my good friends since summer began. I miss some of my old Applebees buddies, like Kellie and Marlee, I've only seen them once in 3 months. Crazy.

Tomorrow is my last day of work and I couldnt be more ecstatic!!!!!!!! I am so tired of that hell hole. I admit, however, sometimes I do have fun at work, but I'd much rather not be there. Carol is coming to meet me on my lunch break because no one else will. I &hearts; her.

Speaking of Carol, she leaves on Sunday. She is the first of my friends to leave for fall semester. It hasnt really hit me yet. I feel like she's going on vacation or something. But, the truth of it is, I probably wont see her for 5 months...maybe more. So that sucks. :(

How much do I love Laguna Beach and RWA? Please.

The boy situation is starting to piss me off. For those of you who know whats going on, thanks for lending an ear. :)

Anyway, my summer has been awesome. My trip to NC was pretty schweet as well. The whole family being together kinda wore on everyone after a while, but it was nice to see them. We went white water rafting and horseback riding, which was fun...especially white water rafting. :) The cabin we stayed in reminded me of staying in a high class summer camp. This cabin was definitely more country than the previous ones we've stayed in. There were bugs everywhere. I mean, huge honkin' spiders were in the basement. The pool table kept us occupied, however. Hulk Hogan stayed in the same cabin as us in 1999. Cool, eh?

Stacy came home to visit me yesterday. Her, Carol and I had a random adventure which involved stealing a lawn gnome (or frog I should say), lots of driving, a camera, and all of Coral Springs' hot spots. (the few at least). Did you guys know that all of the scultures they are putting in on Sample road are supposedly meant to make CS more like Los Olas? I thought that was kinda neat.

Work is definately better that I thought it would be. I've made friends with the people there and they are a lot of fun. I get $350 a week plus commission, talk about bringing in the benjamins! ha. 

I'm so excited to move to Tally. My room mate seems really sweet and now that my schedule dilemma is fixed, everything is looking up. Because I passed AP Lit I had to drop ENC1102 and replace it with AMH2020. Blah. I hate history.

This fourth of July is going to be AWESOME!

Tomorrow is Friday which means I have a shorter day of work. 9-3 instead of 8-4. Plusssss, since it's a holiday weekend, they'll probably let us go earlier. I'm actually starting to like work. I've made friends with the people and theyre a cool group. Its a weird mix of people though. Theres a druggie 50 year old mother. A ghetto 23 year old guy. A divorced 40 year old mom who is like 5'2. And a 25 year old Texan with 2 7 year old kids. We're a big mush of misfits. 

I miss mu friends. Its weird, since Hannah has left for UF we talk even more than we did when she lived in Coral Springs. I mean, we talk every day. I miss my Mariah. She cracks me up, :).

This weekend has been amazing. On Friday I hung out with Hannah. We tried getting people together for iceskating, but that fell through, so we went to Gameworks. My brother gave us free play cards so we played for about an hour and then bought our own cards. We got 602 tickets so we both got mood rings and a bunch of other junkie things. :) I had such a nice night with her!

Last night was Carol's graduation party. I got there super early and hung with her and her family. Around 8 I left to go to Jessica's house for a fondue party. Mark, David, Ryan, Eric, Vincent, Samantha, and Michael were also there. We made a beer/cheese fondue which was AMAZING. After we finished that off we wanted chocolate fondue. We didnt have any alcohol to put into the chocolate so Ryan and I headed over to a hole in the wall liquor store to get some. His fake ID is pretty schweet. We got banana liquor and headed back to Jessica's. We all ended up staying at her house until like, 2:30am. I seriously had the best night ever. It was so nice seeing everyone again. Vinny and I are going to the Melting Pot on Tuesday because I've never been. That will be fun. :)

I got a job on Monday and I started on Tuesday. I get $9 to start (she said she would raise me if I do well) and I get commission. I work 8-4 Monday through Friday and I get paid every Friday, $360. :) That comes out to be $1,440 a month plus my commission check which I get on the 15th of every month. I get paid lunch and two paid breaks. :) It has really been tiring me out, though.

My mom made me start my job on Tuesday so I didnt get to go with Carol to the flippin' Keys. Her family had been planning this vacation for like, 6 months and than BAM, my mom is like ""you need money, you need to work, no Keys for you."" I'm upset about it, but Carol and I are already planning to go to the Keys or Marco Island with a big group of us before we leave for college. :)

I've been hanging out alot with Carol and Stacy. It's been fun and I'm really treasuring my time left here in Coral Springs. I mean, even when I'm driving into my neighborhood I take everything in. I want to remember where I grew up. Stacy leaves on Wednesday, I couldnt be more sad. :(

Tomorrow I am haning out with Hannah. She leaves soon, too. :( Love that girl!

I've been so busy. I just got back from Stacy's. We watched Garden State (AWESOME MOVIE!!) and ate homemade tacos. Yum. I leave for North Carolina soon. July 2nd. I cant wait!!!!!!!

We ended up playing with the hermit crabs instead. I've decided that I'm going to get a hermit crab instead of a fish when I head off to college. Theyre easy to take care of and dont require lots of cleaning and what not. :) After the pet store, Stacy and I headed to Toys R Us. haha. I put an application in too. Arby's is right next door so we got Jamocha shakes and ""flirted"" with the cute drive thru boy. Other stops included TJ Max and the Rag Shop (where I got a paint-by-number picture of a giraffe, haha). Pier 1 was right across the way so we went in to see if they had any cute dorm stuff. Thennnnn we went to the mall to visit Matt and waste some time before we met Carol. At around 6 we headed over to the Ale House for some dinner, which Carol treated me to. (You are the best. I heart you!) We went to Magnolia to see Madagasgar, which was a disappointment. :( Oh well. Carol and Stacy were sleepy so I dropped Stacy off and came home. I started my painting and it's looking good! Yessss!

Tomorrow is going to be a relaxing day...hopefully. I'm loving summer!

I'm on Facebook! Friend me!"

"event","My summer is shaping up to be awesome. Last night I went bowling with the gang, which was free might I add. :) Tonight we all went iceskating. I really forgot how much fun it is. I had such an awesome time. I want to do it every weekend but it wont be the same without Stacy. She leaves in a week and it really is making me sad. She's one of my good friends. :(

It's <i>crazy</i> how things change. Over the past couple of years my life has evolved soooo much. Friends come and go, classes changes, and then, BAM, you graduate. Life makes a 360. It really does. But you know? I'm content with how things are turning out. I dont miss the people I thought I'd miss, because the people I truly wanted to see I am seeing. In the words of Good Charlotte, ""Some say that time changes, best friends can become strangers, but I dont want that, no not for you, if you just stay with me we can make it through."" I hope I stay close with everyone I care about. :(

In 71 days I will leave Coral Springs for good. No more Sample Road. No more Magnolia, or Coral Square Mall. The things I took for granted the past 14 years will be just a fading memory. :( In its place will be Murphy, North Carolina. Instead of Sample Road I will drive on Cross Creek Drive. Instead of the 16 screens at Magnolia, I will have the whopping 2 screens at the Henn Theatre. The Hillbilly fleamarket will be my new Coral Square Mall. Yippee.

But I guess all in all things happen for a reason. People leave your life to make room for new ones. Like a speaker at orientation said, ""Life is a script, and you're the star. You are always auditioning people for roles in your show, but not everyone gets the part. And, if they do and dont work out, all you have to do is write them out. Slowly work them out of the show."" I swear, everything that man said hit home for me. 

Anyway, I'm babbling. Tomorrow I have lunch plans with Carol and afternoon plans with Stacy. Tomorrow night we're going to see Madagascar. :)"

I would like to start this brief entry by saying: <B>LOL</B>. That is all I have to say about that. haha.

Anyway. I had the BEST time in Tally. I met some awesome people, a lot of whom are living in my dorm. My main friend at orientation was a girl named Ashton. She was from Atlanta and was such a cool girl. I feel really comfortable with the campus now. We did A LOT of walking, which is awesome, and I got some good information about college life. I'm glad I have a group of friends at FSU so I dont have to start off alone. We all exchanged numbers before we left. Schweet.

I picked my classes today. I have 14 hours. I wanted AT LEAST 15, but it just didnt work out that way. Oh well. 

General Biology: <b>M W F</b> 9:05am - 9:55am
General Biology Lab: <b>W</B> 6:50pm - 8:45pm 
English 2: <b>M W</b> 3:35pm - 4:50pm
Teaching Diverse Populations: <b>T R</b> 11:00am - 12:15pm
Anthropology: <b>T R</b> 2:00pm - 3:15pm

I got my roomate assignment this weekend too. My roomate's name is Michelle and she is from Maryland. I'm excited about that because she is in the same spot as me - we both dont know anyone. :) I am room 430 in Cawthon Hall. SCHWEEEET. My friend, Laurie, and I snuck into the dorm when we werent supposed to and saw our actual rooms. I'm psyched. Michelle and I share a bathroom with our two other suite-mates. I took pictures but I doubt I'll post them. We'll see.

Anyway. I had a looooonnnggg weekend. 13 hours of orientation on Tuesday and 5 hours today. (not to mention a 7 hour drive!!!!). Thats all for now. Adios mi amigos.

I'm still unemployed, which really sucks, but somehow I'm getting by...barely. I've been sick for a week now and I'm frankly really sick (haha) of it. A non-stop stuffy nose is pretty much the worst thing ever. Despite these sucky set backs, my summer has been awesome. This past week has included graduation, numerous graduation parties, time with friends and time to relax. It's been awesome, but a little overwhelming. I'm not use to all of this free time on my hands! 

I applied at a day care center where Danielle Pampenella works. I hope they hire me. It seems really laid back plus, I love kids! It'd be cool to get close to Danielle again. We were best friends in 9th grade. Anyway.

Tomorrow I leave for Tallahassee. I'm excited but also scared shitless. How the hell do I know what classes to pick!? I mean, ENG3483471498 doesnt really seem familiar. ha. I'm dreading the long ride there, too. Ugh. 7ish hours in a car with my dad isnt something to look forward to.

Alot of my friends leave for summer term soon. It's weird, graduation hasnt hit me yet. I still feel like I'm going to see everyone again, and granted, I will see some here and there, but for the most part, I'm done. I never have to see Amy Wernikoff's face again. Now thats a breathe of fresh air. 

Anyway. I still have to pack, shower, etc etc. I'll leave you all with some pictures for your enjoyment. &hearts;.

"event","Tonight was pretty awesome. I didnt do anything particularly different than other nights, but I was with an old friend. I havent hung out with Rachel in God knows how long. It just so happens that we were both bored, and both online at the same time. I picked her up and we went to Friday's for some dinner. (Well, only I ate, but who cares?) We reminisced about old times and talked about what has been going on in our lives. I miss that girl! After dinner we rented <i>Cabin Fever</i> at Blockbuster. The box looked pretty lame, but we couldnt find anything better. <b>PLUS</b> Rider Strong stars in it! &hearts; Obsession... 30 minutes in to the movie I started getting <i>really</i> sick. My stomach started cramping up and my back was killing me. I thought I was going to either die or throwup. I left :( Sorry Ren, we'll finish it some time this week! I feel a little bit better now, but I'm still really queasy.

I had a weird dream last night. It was all about college and moving in to my dorm. I remember weird details like the carpet and the wallpaper. And I remember something about toilet paper in the elevators (and for some reason it was normal). The weirdest part of the dream was walking in to my room and having Max Palumbo follow me in. He was my room mate. I cant imagine having Max as a room mate. I'd have fucking Steve Schwartz and Justin Boswell there 24/7. haha. It was an awesome dream. Most of my friends were there, even though they arent going to FSU. Maybe it was symbolic...even though I'm leaving my friends behind, I'll be making new friends that will help me cope with leaving my old ones. I hope that's the case! :)

Anyway. Today sucked. My air conditioner was broken. I slept until 2. Now I'm sick. Figures. My grandparents are coming tomorrow! I havent seen them since early February!!"

"event","So anyway. Yesterday was the last day of school, like I said in my prior entry. The one thing I will never forget, as corny as it sounds, is saying the pledge of allegiance for the last time. Now, let me explain. Normally the class disregards the announcements and talks through them. Well, yesterday my government teacher goes, ""This is the last time you will say the pledge ever!"" So, when the announcements came on, everyone stood to say the pledge. Our class said it so loud, at the top of our lungs, with huge goofy grins on our faces. At the end we all cheered. haha. It was so corny but it gave me goosebumps. It was awesome. :)

Last night was also something I'll never forget. I was planning on having an evening in so I could watch American Idol and straighten my hair. Carol came over and we watched AI together, which was SO funny by the way. Anyway. The best part of the night was <B>MIDNIGHT MADNESS</B>!! haha! What it is, is a scavenger hunt all over Coral Springs that only CSHS seniors do. Apparently the seniors do it every year. At midnight, anyone who wanted to come met at Publix. There turned out to be like 45 seniors there. Everyone pays $5 and whoever finishes the scavenger hunt first gets the jackpot. My group consisted of Carol, Nicole and Stacy. It was seriously the most fun I've had in a loooonnnggg time. The first clue was ""This red haired girl with braids goes to college."" We knew it was probably Wendy's, but which one? haha. We finally realized that it was the one on University Dr. (hence the college thing). Anyway. There were 10 clues in all, and despite the major set back at the casino (there was a clue there but the fucking security guard was pissed and blocked us from getting it), we did pretty well. Granted, we didnt win, but we were pretty close! It was over at around 1:45 and Carol started to take me home. This is where things got scary.

Ok, so Carol was driving me home. This guy behind her was right on her ass, flashing his brights and hazards and being a dick. Carol was getting pissed so I flicked them off. For the next like, 20 minutes it was a full out chase. The guy was following us and when I say following, I mean following us through red lights when Carol would run them. It was scary shit. At one point they pulled up next to us and we all ducked because we didnt want to get shot. I peeked and saw two guys with sweatshirts on, the hoods pulled over their heads and only their eyes were showing. It was straight out of the movies. OMG it was nuts. We finally lost them when Carol practically flipped the Explorer. ha.

Then we went to Steak and Shake. There were some freaky guys on the other side of the wall from us and they kept peeking over and saying ""shhhhh"" when we werent even talking. It was so funny. Our waitress had one tooth, and there was the most wasted girl I have ever seen sitting nearby. She was falling out of her seat. It was NUTS. It mustve been because of the full moon :)

Anyway. I got a job today! I had an interview at 9:30am and he hired me because he <i>loved</i> my personality. ha. I start at 8:50/hour and if I do well he said he would raise me. I work 9-4 Monday through Friday. Schweet.

Today was my last day of highschool....ever. I cannot believe it! I guess it hasn't really hit me yet because I feel like tomorrow is going to be just like any other day. But, the fact of the matter is, it wont be. Tomorrow is the first day of summer. Granted, I will see everyone tomorrow at the senior awards and Friday at the senior breakfast, but it'll be different. I'm so happy that I dont have to see anyone I dont want to see <b>ever</b> again. It feels great. 

At 9:30 tomorrow I have an interview. The guy told me that I will be making apx $1000 a week, (I'll have to see it to believe it) and I wont have to work nights <i>or</i> weekends. When I spoke to the man on the phone it went pretty well. He was super nice and was cracking jokes with me. He even made a comment about how outgoing and extroverted I was! ha! The good thing about this job is that i wont have to make friends. I wont have to ""get in"" with the manager. All I have to do is sit in a chair and call people.

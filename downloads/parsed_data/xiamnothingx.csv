"event","you dont apreciate what you have until it is gone.
and its gone. and i wish i wouldnt have been so angry.
i wish i wouldnt have made him feel the way i did.
i miss what i had. i dont even care anymore that he just wanted to be friends that was good enough for me. i just didnt realize it at the time. but now hes gone. and nothing will bring him back. and i thought i didnt care.  now i realize that i did. and i still do. when you repress something enough it only makes it worse.
and i miss going to burito grande.. 
and him knowing exactly what i want. and i miss hearing him talking about politics. bringing back the memories of when i used to care.  
and no i wasnt in love. but i had a really good friend. 
but i fucked it all up. 
and goddamit if i could talk to him right now i would tell him every bit of this. but i cant. i probably never will again.
and i cant help but wonder if he thinks me anymore. or if he even cares. or if hes ever coming back. 
i guess the moral of the story is not to sweat the small stuff"

"event","why is it that boys cannot think before they speak.
once.. just once i would like to meet a guy who only had NICE things to say. and if they werent nice they would be something that would never offend you. never.
why arent they worried about what you think? we  usually worry about them . why cant they give us the equal treatment? if any boys are reading this. there are things that you shouldnt do when it comes to girls
1. dont point out thier flaws (they already know aobut them i promise)
2. dont talk about other girls... ever

guys wonder why thier girlfriends are ""always mad at them""
it is more than likely because you did one of these things!
jesus guys think before you speak.. its not that hard."

"event","about once a week when im walking down the street a man who lives 4 houses down from me harasses me. today he said ""now that i could drive"" then his friend came out side and called him a sick fuck and said i look like ""olive oil on crack"" strangely i was more offended by the first comment. 

scott made me walk around two blocks of my nieghborhood.. just so he could get up the nerve to say the friend speach. and he held my hand the whole time. Why would you hold someones hand that you just want to be friends with???"

"event","i was hanging out with scott and things were going fine. then we left to his house his ex girlfriend was at his house. i wanted to slit her fucking throat and watch her bleed. but i just sat there quietly til i got the courage up to say i wanted to go home.  boys are so fucking intimidating. if i was with her by myself i would have told that cunt exactly what i thought of her. but since i wasnt and scott was there i just kept my mouth shut. if i ever see her in public with out him there i am going to tell her how ugly she is. and how much i want to fucking slice her up.  i hate stupid whores."

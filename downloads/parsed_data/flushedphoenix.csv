I got asked if I could do some cupcakes for tomorrow (at lunchtime today) for a girl in the office who is leaving tomorrow to take up a secondment (eek we seem to be loosing a lot of them recently). I know she likes chocolate I have just bought a Kelly special cupcake scoop and thought I really need to try to pipe icing as well. The topping is Thornton's Milk & White Chocolate buttons and fudge pieces.

"event","ok so i have been very quiet here recently - i have been busy starting my business and learning sugar craft so i thought i would show you my first ever attempt - all the flowers and things are mine&nbsp; but Alan Dunn put the arrangement together for me.
 <img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flushedphoenix/pic/0000xy53"" width=""507"" height=""800"">

I have just finished a 3 day course with Alan Dunn this weekend and the above is what i made.&nbsp; I am in the middle of a 10 week sugar crafting course in Forres right now as well.&nbsp; I am through in Aberdeen this weekend and next weekend - will more than likely not be at elizium as i am completely broke right now but would be available to meet up for a coffee in the afternoon iof any one wants to meet up.

My lappy is still broken so other than getting info up on to my website i haven't been able to do much of the design but the url is <a href=""http://www.sweettreatsandcakes.co.uk"">cakes and bakes site</a> so it is only copy right now.

oh well better get up and get ready for work since i start in 20 minutes :s

I know you weren't exactly a nice person at school to me but I at least thought you got the message when my parents called the police to find out how to make you leave me alone, or when I abruptly left town at the very beginning of S6.  I want you to respect my request 9 years ago and my continuing wish of leave me the fuck alone and never contact me again.</P>"

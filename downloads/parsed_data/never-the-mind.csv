Its like, I like it, but it pains my heart to remember.  But, it brings out my true self.  It stops me from being such a douche to being serious.  I get so emotional.

"event","the hollywood show was tonight.  damn, i sucked.  Sarah did perfect.  shane was fucking hilarious.  hmm.  i really don't think i was good at all.  Natalie says that i was too tight of a dancer to dance with Sarah.  fan-fucking-tastic.  that just lifts my spirits.  i wish i could just rewind to the time before the show and practice more.  i knew something was wrong.  maybe i'm just not cut out for the dancing shit.  then again, Sarah was once a cheerleader, so its not entirely my fault.  she was ment to dance well.

i saw julia's ""dad"".  what an oaf.  people like that need to stop being an asshole and start trying to be somebody.  i'm not just being be mean to my kids and get a job at some fucking store.  well, maybe i'll smack my kids around a little bit,  but thats just not the point :) .  i want to be somebody.  i want to be...a rock star...  chik-a-wow!

well, i'd rather live a good life than not live one at all.

holy crap, its 11 o'clock.  after the show, we went to eat.  it sucked.  yeah, i had nasty strawberries that were nasty.  and their nastyness was nauseating.

i want to skip a period tomorrow, but i can't anymore because the show is over.  luckily, noah is trying to do a play of Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i>.  lets see what happens there."

Julia didn't come either, because she was sick.  But we had a free day in gym anyway, so whatever.  I forced myself to play bullshit with Matt and Chesnee and Tara and whomever.  It was boring.

La, la, la.  I have to do an essay right now.  On one of the sections in my World History book.  Ch 29, bitches.  And on top of that, I have to do #2 on each section assessment, which is usually a chart of something.  Like a...time line, or something.  Its gay.

Oh, by the fucking way, Ms. McCollum cancelled the goddamn show.  I don't know why, but its just not going on, which really pissed off all the people that auditioned and made it.  Luckily, I'm gonna be in the Havana Nights skit on monday at the Hollywood Show.  So look forward to it.

We wrote a new song!  Bam, uh!  Suck it.

We don't exactly have a name for it.  But if you'd like to, you can help us think of one.  Here are the lyrics:


<i>I came from a hurricane,
Where nothing's what it seems.
Everybody's wasted,
And all the talk is cheap.
Simple thinking; simple minds,
And simple ways of life,
Disguise the lies that lie,
Behind everybody's smile.

Once I was afraid of love,
Pretty soon I learned,
Life ain't worth living,
When all you bridges are burned.
One time I had dark skies,
Hanging over my head,
Then she came along,
And laid my fears to rest.

If time and place,
Knew their place,
They'd learn to stay apart.
If love and hate,
Did not have fate,
They could not play their part.
Winds of change are blowing hard,
From the center of the earth.
The unborn child,
Has no chance,
He's branded before birth.</i>

Thats what we've got so far."

But I am someone who watched a funny video at ebaumsworld.com.  I was so bored, I even copied the lyrics of the song in it.




Met a girl over the net,
Saved our chats on a floppy diskette,
It went well for a week or two,
Then it all came unglued.

One night she said ""BRB"".
Waited up for an hour or three,
Then I started to realize,
She wasn't coming back online.

She freakin' blocked me.
Trust,
She freakin' blocked me.
La la la la,
We talked all night then she put my sn on her block list.
Then she clicked ""OK"".

She told me she was taking a shower,
And she'd be back in a half hour.
But she pulled one over on me,
W-T-F, O-M-F-G?

I was ticked, but not convinced,
Had to be sure before my ego was minced.
Good thing I'm such a whiz,
Signed with my other name and, yup, there she is.

She friggin' blocked me.
Trust,
She friggin' blocked me.
La la la la,
We talked all night then she put my sn on her block list.
Then she clicked ""OK"".

That's my story, as you see,
Never trust a women when she says ""BRB"",
Now it's over, and I'm torn
But I signed her up for beastiality porn!

She friggin' blocked me.
Trust,
She friggin' blocked me.
La la la la,
We talked all night then she put my sn on her block list.
Then she clicked ""OK"".

He figured he'd crawl outside to get some fresh air, since maybe that would sober him up. Once outside, he stood up and fell flat on his face. So he decided to crawl the four blocks to his house.

When he arrived at the door he stood up and again fell flat on his face.

He crawled through the door and into his bedroom. When he reached his bed he tried one more time to stand up.

This time he managed to pull himself upright, but he quickly fell right into bed and was sound asleep the second his head hit the pillow.

"event","The following snippet has been taken from <tt>http://maddox.xmission.com</tt>.

Man, I love Ben Stiller. I can't get enough of him.  Someone needs to invent a way to liquify him so he can be injected directly into my veins in super-saturated form, because his monopoly on comedy isn't enough.

I don't know when it dawned on me that we need more movies starring Ben Stiller, but I think it happened around the time I came out of the theater after seeing a preview for ""Envy"" during ""Starsky & Hutch,"" an ad for ""Dodgeball"" in the theater lobby, and ""Along Came Polly"" playing in a dollar theater across the street.

That's just not enough for an actor of his caliber. Each of his characters is unique, displaying the full gamut of emotions on the spectrum (of emotions), ranging from: extremely quirky and neurotic to somewhat quirky and neurotic. Ben Stiller should be cloned so that we can have more of his movies released in theaters simultaneously.

Why not create a movie where Ben Stiller stars in every role? It could be like ""Multiplicity,"" except good. They could call it:

<b><font color=""purple"">along came</font> <font color=""green"">something</font> <font color=""aqua"">about</font> 
<font color=""darkred"">royal focker's</font> envy 
<font color=""aqua"">for the</font> <font color=""red"">dodgeballs</font> 
<font color=""aqua"">of the</font> mystery men</b>

It would be the best movie ever. It would start out with Ben Stiller trying to revive some obscure children's ball game in order to impress his highschool sweetheart, only to learn that she has psychotic ex-CIA parents who hit it big when they discover a formula that makes shitty movies disappear.

I actually skated in the bowl today.  Hardly anyone was over there, so me and Ian went over there.  I also learned to drop in and turn around on the ramps and quarterpipes.  I went on the highest roll-in and the highest ramp, too.  I bought (or I would say ""earned"") two stickers to stand for all that I've learned today.

I talked to the little dude's dad.  He said that he (little dude) got a board for his birthday once and he'd been skating ever since. That was two years ago.

I'm leaving.  My body is screaming in pain and I need to deal with it.  Comment.  Do it.....now."

"event","Wake your eyes cause the world's still turning around, 
The love that we built,
Called in sick 'cause I spent the night dreaming loud, 
The time she was ill.
And I'm running so far from this guilt. 

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them, 
There are colors inside that I cannot find the words for, 
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water. 
So don't pass me by, yeah. 

All my time is in rhyme 'cause I live in a dream,
Where she can be free. 
I set myself to the side and I'll watch as the lives,
Pass as I sleep. 
Oh, it doesn't mean I can't believe. 

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them, 
There are colors inside that I cannot find the words for. 
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water. 
So don't pass me by. 

All I see is the girl that bleeds in the dark,
But no one's around. 
Takes her time 'cause her beauty's in rhyme with her soul, 
Flys like the dove. 
And no one can tell who to love 

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them, 
There are colors inside that I can not find the words for. 
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water. 
So don't pass me by. 

Wake your eyes cause the world's still turning around,
The love that we built. 
Called in sick 'cause I spent the night dreaming loud, 
The time you were ill.

Wake your eyes, Wake your eyes, Wake your eyes..."

"event","Damn it, today everyone has just been either a dick or just plain boring.  Therefore, I have put aside my services for today and decided to make horoscopes.  Some were originally stolen.  However, I do agree with them.  So fuck off.

<B>Horoscopes by <S>Adam Sandler</S> Me</B>

<U>Aquarius (Jan 23 - Feb 22)</U>: 

You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be progressive. You lie a great deal. You make the same mistakes repeatedly because you are stupid. Everyone thinks you are a fucking jerk.

<U>Pisces (Feb 23 - Mar 22)</U>: 

You are a pioneer type and think most people are dickheads. You are quick to reprimand, impatient and full of advice. You do nothing but piss-off everyone you come in contact with. You are a prick.

<U>Aries (Mar 23 - April 22)</U>: 

You have a wild imagination and often think you are being followed by the FBI or CIA. You have major influence on your friends and people resent you for flaunting your power. You lack confidence but are still a general bad ass.

<U>Taurus (April 23 - May 22)</U>: 

You are practical and persistent. You have a dogged determination and work like hell. Most people think you are stubborn and bullheaded. You are nothing but a goddamed communist.

<U>Gemini (May 23 - June 22)</U>: 

You are a quick and intelligent thinker. People like you because you are bisexual. You are inclined to expect too much for too little. This means you are a cheap bastard. Geminis are notorious for thriving on incest.

<U>Cancer (June 23 - July 22)</U>: 

You are sympathetic and understanding to other people's problems, which makes you a sucker. You are always putting things off. That is why you will always be on welfare and won't be worth a shit. Everyone in prison is a Cancer.

<U>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</U>: 

You consider yourself a born leader. Others think you are an idiot. Most leos are bullies. You are vain and cannot tolerate criticism. Your arrogance is disgusting. Leo people are thieving motherfuckers and enjoy masturbation more than sex.

<U>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</U>: 

You are a logical type and hate disorder. Your shit-picking attitude is sickening to your friends and co-workers. You are cold and unemotional and often fall asleep while fucking, though your penis size is off the scale. Virgos make good bus drivers and pimps.

<U>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</U>: 

You are the artistic type and have a difficult time dealing with reality. If you are a male you are probably queer. Chances for employment and monetary gain are nill. Most Libra women are whores. All Libras die of venereal disease.

<U>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 22)</U>: 

You are the worst of the lot. You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted. You shall achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics. You are the perfect son-of-a-bitch. Most Scorpios are murdered.

<U>Sagittarius (Nov 23 - Dec 22)</U>: 

You are optimistic and enthusiastic. You have a reckless tendency to rely on your luck since you have no talent. The majority of Sagittarians are drunks. You are a worthless piece of shit.

<U>Capricorn (Dec 23 - Jan 22)</U>: 

You are conservative and afraid of taking risks. You are basically chickenshit. There has never been a Capricorn of any importance. You should kill yourself."

I woke up at 6:00, then 6:30, just to be told we had a two hour delay.  So I went back to sleep.  Then, I awoke at 7:30, then went back to sleep.  Then the same happened at 8:00.  Then 8:30, so I got up.

Next was shower.  Then clothes. Then sit.  Then cereal.

Moment of inner freedom
when the mind is opened and the
infinite universe revealed
& the soul is left to wander
dazed & confus'd searching
here & there for teachers & friends.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moment of Freedom
as the prisoner
blinks in the sun
like a mole
from his hole

a child's 1st trip
away from home

That moment of Freedom

Cold treatment of our empress

he enters stage:

Blood boots. Killer storm.
Fool's gold. God in a heaven.
Where is she?
Have you seen her?
Has anyone seen this girl?
snap shot (projected)
She's my sister.
Ladies & gentlemen:
please attend carefully to these words & events
It's your last chance, our last hope.
In this womb or tomb, we're free of the swarming streets.
The black fever which rages is safely out those doors
My friends & I come from
Far Arden w/ dances, &
new music
Everywhere followers accrue
to our procession.
Tales of Kings, gods, warriors
and lovers dangled like
jewels for your careless pleasure

I'm Me!
Can you dig it.
My meat is real.
My hands--how they move
balanced like lithe demons
My hair--so twined and writhing
The skin of my face--pinch the cheeks
My flaming sword tongue
spraying verbal fire-flys
I'm real.
I'm human
But I'm not an ordinary man
No No No



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Is it music?
We can play music.
But you want more.
You want something & someone new.
Am I right?
Of course I am.
You want ecstasy
Desire & dreams.
Things not exactly what they seem.
I lead you this way, he pulls that way.
I'm not singing to an imaginary girl.
I'm talking to you, my self.
Let's recreate the world.
The palace of conception is burning.

Look. See it burn.
Bask in the warm hot coals.

You're too young to be old
You don't need to be told
You want to see things as they are.
You know exactly what I do
Everything

I am a guide to the Labyrinth

Monarch of the protean towers
on this cool stone patio
above the iron mist
sunk in its own waste
breathing its own breath



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POWER 

I can make the earth stop in
its tracks. I made the
blue cars go away.

I can make myself invisible or small.
I can become gigantic & reach the
farthest things. I can change
the course of nature.
I can place myself anywhere in
space or time.
I can summon the dead.
I can perceive events on other worlds,
in my deepest inner mind,
& in the minds of others.

I can

I am

People need Connectors
Writers, heroes, stars, leaders
To give life form.
A child's sand boat facing
the sun.
Plastic soldiers in the miniature
dirt war. Forts.
Garage Rocket Ships

Ceremonies, theatre, dances
To reassert Tribal needs & memories
a call to worship, uniting
above all, a reversion,
a longing for family & the
safety magic of childhood

The grand highway

The rest

A man rakes leaves into 
a heap in his pard, a plie,
& leans on his rake &
burns them utterly.
The fragrance fills the forest
children pause & heed the
smell, which will become
nostalgia in several years

Sirens
Water
Rain & Thunder
Jet from the base
Hot searing insect cry
The frogs & crickets
Doors open & close
The smash of glass
The Soft Parade
An accident
Rustle of silk, nylon
Watering the dry grass
Fire
Bells
Rattlesnake, whistles, castanets
Lawn mower
Good Humor man
Skates & wagons
Bikes

Where'd you learn about
Satan-out of a book
Love?-out of a box

night of sin (The Fall)
-1st sex, a feeling of having
done this same act in time before
O No, not again



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between childhood, boyhood,
adolescence 
& manhood (maturity) there
should be sharp lines drawn w/
Tests, deaths, feats, rites
stories, songs, & judgements 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Men who go out on ships
To escape sin & the mire of cities
watch the placenta of evening stars
from the deck, on their backs
& cross the equator
& perform rituals to exhume the dead
dangerous initiation
To mark passage to new levels

To feel on the verge of an exorcism
a rite of passage
To wait, or seek manhood
enlightenment in a gun

To kill childhood, innocence
in an instant

LAMERICA 

Trade-routes
guide lines
The Vikings & explorers
Discoverers
The unconscious

a map of the states
The veins of hiways
Beauty of a map
Hidden connections
Fast trampled forest

Madness in a whisper
neon crackle
The hiss of trees
A city growls

rich vast & sullen
like a slow monster
come to fat
& die

THE ANATOMY OF ROCK 

The 1st electric wildness came
over the people
on sweet Friday.
Sweat was in the air.
The channel beamed,
token of power.
Incense brewed darkly.
Who could tell them that here
it would end?

One school bus crashed w/ a train.
This was the Crossroads.
Mercury stained.
I couldn't get out of my seat.
The road was littered
w/ dead jitterbugs.
Help,
we'll be late for class.

The secret flurry of rumor
marched over the yard &
pinned us unwittingly
Mt. fever.
A girl stripped naked on the
base of the flagpole.

In the restrooms all was cool 
& silent
w/ the salt-green of latrines.
Blankets were needed.

Ropes fluttered.
Smiles flattered
& haunted.

Lockers pried open
& secrets discovered.

Ah sweet music.

Wild sounds in the night
Angel siren voices.
The baying of great hounds.
Cars screaming thru gears
& shrieks
on the wild road
Where the tires skip & slide
into dangerous curves.

Favorite corners.
Cheerleaders raped in summer
buildings.
Holding hands
& bopping toward Sunday.

Those lean sweet desperate hours.

Time searched the hallways
for a mind.
Hands kept time.
The climate altered like a 
visible dance.

Night-time women.
Wondrous sacraments of doubt
Sprang sullen in bursts
of fear & guilt
in the womb's pit hole
below
The belt of the beast



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worship w/ words, w/
sounds, hands, all
joyful playful &
obscene-in the insane 
infant.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old men worship w/ long
noses, old soulful eyes.
Young girls worship,
exotic, indian, w/ robes
who make us feel foolish
for acting w/ our eyes.
Lost in the vanity of the senses
which got us where we are.
Children worship but seldom
act at it. Who needs
temples & couches & T.V.

We can do it on a sunny
floor w/ friends & make
any sound or movement
that comes. Roll on our
backs screaming w/ mirth
glad in the guilt of our
madness. Better to be
cool in our worship &
gain the respect of the
ancient & wise wearing
those robes. They know
the secret of mind-change
reality.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Have you ever seen God?""
-a mandala. A symmetrical angel.

Felt? yes. Fucking. The Sun.
Heard? Music. Voices.
Touched? an animal. your hand.
Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water,
& wine.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An angel runs
Thru the sudden light
Thru the room
A ghost precedes us
A shadow follows us
And each time we stop
We fall



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No one thought up being;
he who thinks he has
Step forward



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shrill demented sparrows bark
The sun into being. They rule
dawn's kingdom. The cars-
a rising chorus- Then
workmen's songs & hammers
The children of the schoolyard,
a hundred high voices,
complete the orchestration



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""In that year there was
an intense visitation 
of energy.
I left school & went down
to the beach to live.
I slept on a roof
At night the moon became
a woman's face.
I met the Spirit of Music.""



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An appearance of the devil
on a Venice canal.
Running, I saw a Satan
or Satyr, moving beside
me, a fleshy shadow
of my secret mind. Running,
Knowing.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The day I left the beach

A hairy Satyr running
behind & a little to the
right.

In the holy solipsism
of the young

Now I can't walk thru a city
street w/out eying each
single pedestrian. I feel
their vibes thru my
skin, the hair on my neck
-it rises.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FEAR 
Eternal consciousness
in the Void
(makes trial and jail seem almost
friendly)

a Kiss in the Storm

(Madman at the wheel
gun at the neck
scape populous & arching
coolly)

A barn
a cabin attic

Your own face
stationary
in the mirrored window

fear of restroom's
Tragic cold
neon

I'm freezing

animals
dead

white wings of
rabbits

grey velvet deer

The Canyon

The car a craft
in wretched
SPACE

Sudden movements

& your past
to warm you
in Spiritless
Night

The Lonely HWY
Cold hiker

Afraid of wolves
& his own
Shadow



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Wolf,
Who lives under the rock
has invited me
to drink of his cool
Water.
Not to splash or bathe
But leave the sun
& know the dead desert
night
& the cold men
who play there.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a ha
Come on, now
luring the Traveler
Mighty Voyager
Curious, into its dark womb
The graves grinning
Indians of night
The eyes of night
Westward lurking
into the brothel, into the blood bath
into the Dream
The dark Dream of conquest
& Voyage
into night, Westward into Night



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAMERICA 

Clothed in sunlight
restled in waiting
dying of fever

Changed shapes of an empire
Starling invaders
Vast promissory notes of joy

Wanton, willful & passive
Married to doubt
Clothed in great warring monuments
of glory

How it has changed you
How slowly estranged you
Solely arranged you

Beg you for mercy



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Crossraods
a place where ghosts
reside to whisper into
the ears of travellers &
interest them in their fate

Hitchhiker drinks:
""I call again on the dark
hidden gods of blood""

-Why do you call us?
You know our price. It
never changes. Death of
you will give you life
& free you from a vile
fate. But it is getting late.

-If I could see you again
& talk w/ you, & walk a
short while in your company,
& drink the heady brew
of your conversations,
I thought

-to rescue a soul already
ruined. To achieve respite.
To plunder green gold
on a pirate raid & bring
to camp the glory of old.

-As the capesman faces
poisoned horns & drinks
red victory; the soldier,
too, w/ his trophy, a
pierced helmet; & the
ledge-walker shuddering
his way into inward grace

-(laughter) Well, then. Would
you mock yourself?

-No.

-Soon our voices must become
one, or one must leave.

Forest strong sandals
burnt geometry fingers

Flame-tree
Sire, we met in Eden
The troubled time
we had
rustling in the night leaves
a sniper aimed at our window
a kitten mewing in the blasted
strong air
I must go see

-You've found your Voice,
friend, after all else
I recognize fast the
Strong sure tones of
a poet
was it a question
Search or of strangling?
I wonder
We never talked
But welcome here
to the camp fire
Share our meal
w/ us
& tell us of your life
& the hanging

-Well 1st I screamed
& I was a child again alive
Then nothing til the age
of 5

& then summers & the racetrack
I looked for a girl in
New Mexican
bars
& found jail
The prostitute looked out 
her cell & saw
Fuck god scratched
on a leprous wall

-You're rambling boy
what of the rest
the jazz highway
he winks.

-I got picked up
& rode through the night

-did you see any buildings

-did I...
What was I doing
of course we danced plenty
She had nice sides
the cop hit me
Stop, I don't remember

-The logs are melting
we must move on
The fire's ending
we'll hear more
at the next altar

Trees
Train-death
The American Night
We went through 5 cords

& had the most beautiful visions
He was a truly religious man
at the end

-you know, I like you guys
god-damn!

(I saw this cat run out
of the ocean, one night,
and beat-off into a fire)

I'm going down to Mexico
To this border town I heard
about & I'm gonna buy
me a girl & bring her
back up here & marry her, it's
true. This guy told me.
A friend of his knew someone who

-You're too much



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was preserved 
in her
The fresh miracle
of
surprise



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

open 

The Night is young
& full of rest
I can't describe
the way she's dress'd
She'll pander to some strange
requests
Anything that you suggest
Anything to please her guest



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIRENS 

Midnight
criminal metabolism of guilt forest
Rattlesnakes whistles catcalls

Remove me from this hall of mirrors
This filthy glass

Are you her
Do you look like that
How could you be when
no one ever could


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Poet of the call-girl storm

She left a note on the bedroom door.
""If I'm out, bring me to.""


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I dropped by to see you
late last night
But you were out
like a light
Your head was on the floor
& rats played pool w/ your eyes

Death is a good disguise
for late at night

Wrapping all its games in its calm garden

But what happens
when the guests return
& all unmask
& you are asked

The miracle of the streets
The scents & songs &

Shiny blackness
so totally naked she was
Totally un-hung-up

We looked around
lights now on
To see our fellow travellers"

"event","For those of reach who never got a chance to know anything about the death of ""Dimebag"" Darrel Abbot, the original guitarist of Pantera, here's your second chance:





<B>Gunman Kills 4 at Ohio Heavy Metal Show</B> 

By JAY COHEN 

<B>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A gunman charged onstage at a nightclub and opened fire on the band and crowd, killing top heavy metal guitarist ``Dimebag'' Darrell Abbott and three other people before a police officer shot him to death, authorities said.</B> 

The gunman had a hostage in a headlock and appeared to be preparing to kill him when the officer fired, police spokesman Sgt. Brent Mull said. The hostage escaped uninjured, Mull said. 

Two other people were hospitalized. Police said one was in intensive care and the other stable. 

Police identified the gunman as Nathan Gale, 25, of Marysville, 25 miles northwest of Columbus. Police said they had no information on a motive or any connection to Abbott or his band, the Texas-based group Damageplan. 

Damageplan had just begun its first song at Alrosa Villa club Wednesday night when the gunman climbed onstage, started yelling and shot Abbott five or six times at point-blank range, witness Chris Couch said. 

Mull said the gunman's exact statement was unclear because of the loud music. He said some witnesses reported hearing an accusation about Abbott breaking up his former band, thrash-rock pioneer Pantera, but it could not be confirmed whether the speaker was the gunman or a fan. 

Couch, 22, said the man was wearing a hooded sweat shirt and was followed by a bouncer and another club employee. 

Couch said that after firing on the guitarist, the gunman shot a bouncer who had pulled him off the musician, while fans surged toward the exit. The gunman then fired into the crowd of more than 250 people, Mull said. 

Mull said Officer James D. Niggemeyer, patrolling nearby, arrived within two minutes of hearing the call. Niggemeyer, 31, saw one person lying dead and the suspect holding onto another ``pretty much in a headlock,'' Mull said. 

He said the hostage, ``probably a fan, maybe someone who worked with the band,'' was able to maneuver out of the way before the officer fired. 

Mull praised Niggemeyer's response. 

``If the officer wasn't as close as he was, I think this would have been a lot worse,'' he said. ``It was a chaotic scene, just a horrific scene.'' 

Besides Abbott and Gale, police said the dead included Nathan Bray, 23, and Erin Halk, 29. Police said the name of the fifth person killed was being withheld pending notification of family. 

Couch said he believed the shooter had a plan. ``It was definitely a grudge. It was against something,'' he said. 

Mull said he believed there was amateur video that officers could view for clues but that police had no answers yet. ``We may never know a motive for this, unless he left a note,'' Mull said. 

Gale has a minor police record in Marysville, said Police Chief Floyd Golden. He was pulled over for driving with a suspended license last month. 

Thursday morning, a dozen yellow roses, still in plastic wrap, lay near the entry to the low-slung beige building that since 1974 has hosted mostly heavy metal acts. The 641-person-capacity club, just off a freeway exit on the city's north side, sits amid motels, small businesses and office complexes. 

Dozens of messages were posted to the band's Web site after the shootings. 

``This is the worst day in metal history,'' one posting read. 

``The metal world feels your pain,'' another wrote. 

Damageplan's debut album, ``New Found Power,'' which was released in February by Elektra, was produced by Abbott and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott. Other band members are vocalist Patrick Lachman and bassist Bob Zilla. 

Earlier, the brothers had been members of the Grammy-nominated Pantera, whose popularity soared in the early 1990s with a fast, aggressive sound. 

``Damageplan carries on the tradition Pantera started, the ... hell-raising tradition we were all about,'' Vinnie Paul Abbott told The Dallas Morning News in October. 

``It took awhile for some of the Pantera fans to accept it; we knew that was gonna be the case,'' he said. ``Change is something that people have a hard time accepting. But me and Dime intended on doing this our whole lives.'' 

The shootings came exactly 24 years after John Lennon was shot to death outside his New York apartment building by a deranged fan."

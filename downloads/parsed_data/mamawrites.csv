Someone (<lj user=""hardvice"">, who was, presumably, frustrated with LiveJournal Abuse team) started targetting livejournal users with breastfeeding images in their default image icons and complaining about those icons to LiveJournal Abuse. 

The boob-n**i breastfeeding advocacy community retaliated en masse, and began encouraging people to email SixApart staff, since SixApart owns Livejournal.

Someone who works for SixApart <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1763041.html"">tried to apologize</a>, but did not succeed in calming tempers.

And the abuse team continues to issue warnings and threaten that accounts will be suspended if users' default images are not changed.

Wow. 

Talk about a live case in how not to manage an online service! <a href=""http://ljabuse.blogspot.com/"">For more blow-by-blows, check out this blog</a>.

Breastfeeding is not sexual. And if that means that my daughter might be exposed to pictures of breasts in default images on livejournal, even if the breasts are not depicted in a breastfeeding context, so be it. 

I will not pay for any livejournal products or services until the Livejournal policy is revised so that it is consistent with my position -- breastfeeding is not sexual."

Please take a moment to do this meme yourself and pass it along. Express your stance on environmental issues without fear of being called a tree-hugging dirt-worshiper. Explain to people that you're a perfectly normal person, and these are perfectly normal values. Believe that individuals can make a difference. Assert your values in an intelligent, informed, and meaningful way. Reclaim environmentalism from bad science, derogatory or dismissive conservatives, and radical zealots! Earth Day should be a bench-mark by which to measure your own practices from year to year, and an opportunity to mindfully educate yourself and others. Next year, check your answers and see if you've made changes or improvement!

Please list five things you do regularly with the environment in mind:
1) I recycle.

2) I use cloth grocery bags.

3) I drive a hybrid car.

4) I shop local whenever possible, so that my goods are not shipped to me from far away.

5) I walk or bike to local shops when I can.

Please identify five Earth Day Resolutions to improve by next year. No goal is too small or large!

1) Walk and bike more.

2) Buy less -- reuse, or reduce the desire for ""new"" things.

3) Buy from the farmer's market more.

4) Eat less meat, and cook more appetizing vegetarian meals for my family.

5) Do more work in the yard, so I can have more influence on whether we use organic methods of pest control and fertilization."

"event","I am not a boob nazi because I believe that compassion is more needed by pregnant women and new mothers than militarism is (after all, the ""nazi"" label is a militaristic one, and the metaphor of ""boot camp"" is as well).
<lj-cut>
Here's what I wrote in my userinfo two summers ago: Although I try not to be too overbearing in my promotion of breastfeeding (I give everyone kudos for trying, and try to support the struggle that nursing our children can sometimes represent in American society), I am becoming increasingly adamant in my opposition to our society's <a href=""http://www.ibfan.org/english/issue/bfundermined01.html"">practices which undermine breastfeeding as the norm</a>. I wish more pregnant women knew about <a href=""http://www.got-breastmilk.org/Onebottlewillhurt.shtml"">the potential dangers of just one bottle, just one ounce of formula</a>, and knew that they should insist on being given the option to pump and feed their baby with a medicine dropper or finger feeder or SNS if they experience early problems with latch.

Here's what I have learned since I wrote that two summers ago: latch is not the only problem that new moms can encounter. Just because my issues with nipple pain and supply were entirely due to poor latch, and were easily remedied, does not mean that the same simple steps I followed will lead to painfree breastfeeding and bountiful supply for others.

Supply issues and pain issues are real for some women. Perhaps those issues can be resolved by addressing latch and positioning, by ruling out thrush, but perhaps not. Some women confront the realization that they are experiencing <a href=""http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/5538-1.asp"">Raynaud's</a> or <a href=""http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nipple-blanching.html"">other causes of extreme nipple pain</a>, and doctors and lactation consultants cannot always work out those issues with new mothers in a timely manner. When pain does not go away for weeks or months, I understand why mothers would use formula instead of continuing to breastfeed through extreme pain. When they cannot produce enough milk on their own through nursing or pumping, and when donor milk is not available, I understand why mothers would use formula.

When we treat women who have encountered real supply or pain issues as if they have ""failed"" and are not ""tough enough"" to rank among the *real* boob nazis, we are demonstrating a lack of compassion. Granted, most breastfeeding challenges can be overcome, but not all. When we blame moms for acting in good faith and pursuing the sometimes misleading advice of pediatricians and lactation consultants, we are punishing the moms instead of the real source of the problem -- the professionals who gave bad advice. (As a professional myself, I recognize that it is unrealistic to expect perfect advice all the time. Professionals are humans, and we make mistakes.) 

Moms need the expertise that they can receive from experienced supporters of breastfeeding, such as what the <lj comm=""boob_nazis""> can provide, but many of them need it without the implication that if they can't exclusively nurse, then they are ""failing"" or lacking what it takes to get through ""boot camp"". That's why I am glad that <lj comm=""breastorbottle""> and <lj comm=""mommymilk""> exist, because I think they provide the kind of support that a significant portion of the female population deserves -- support without blame. That's the kind of support I want to provide, as a breastfeeding advocate.

"event","<a href=""http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9501/articles/givingtree.html"">Critical Commentary on Shel Silverstein's The Giving Tree</a> made me reflect on the notion of maternal love as sacrifice. (Thanks to <lj user=""ambitious_wench""> for the link to the critical commentary.) More and more, I realize that this notion that mothers should sacrifice for their children is poison, leading to choices that are unhealthy for the mother and for the child. 

There's a difference between taking a long-term view, and choosing the long-term benefits of a particular action in spite of the short-term costs, and sacrificing your own self-interest blindly in favor of your child's ""best"" interests. Particularly as a mother of a girl, I realize now that if I choose my daughter's happiness at the cost of my own pain, then I am teaching her to devalue her own happiness, if she feels that she must eventually step into my shoes.

So for example, what do I teach my daughter if I sacrifice a morning at work to spend time with her so that she can avoid the discomfort of going to school? If I teach her that what I want more than anything else is to spend time with her, and do not even acknowledge that on this particular morning, I actually *want* to go to work instead of spending time with her, I make her desire to stay home more comfortable, and allow her to avoid the pain that comes with learning to deal with a new situation. She may be happy, in the short run, but I am in pain that she cannot even see -- at least not until she becomes a mother and feels unspoken pressure to make similar choices for her child.

What if, instead, I insist that sometimes I will stay home with her, when she is sick and has a valid reason to stay home, but not every time she asks? What if I insist that other times, when she is not sick, I really want her to go to school so that she can learn something that I can't teach her, and so I can go to work? It is true that I would not be acting like the giving tree. But perhaps by not giving until I am exhausted, I am giving my daughter a different gift -- the gift of learning that even if something seems overwhelming, it's still worth trying to confront it. Perhaps I'm giving her the faith in her own ability to survive the unknown and frightening, and I'm giving her the opportunity to experience pride in herself and her growing capacity for independence.

The tricky thing is that I think some portion of maternal sacrifice is an evolutionary phenomenon, which made sense when the survival of the human race was in doubt... it made sense for the older and weaker humans to sacrifice their chance at life on behalf of the younger and stronger humans. However, our instincts have not caught up with the reality that human genes are no longer in danger of extinction. In some ways, we may need to fight against our instinct to protect our young by sacrificing ourselves for their needs and desires. We need to temper the instinct for self-sacrifice in order to preserve not just the human race, but the entire ecosystem, which is threatened by the overly selfish instincts of human beings. 

Paradoxically, it may be that the way to limit the selfishness of the next generation is to demonstrate some of our own selfishness. Learning to distinguish between the needs of our children, which may merit sacrifice, and the desires of our children, which should only be attained through their own striving and not at the cost of our sacrifices, becomes an essential skill for the human race. It is a skill that we mothers can help our children to learn, if we practice it ourselves."

"event","This is a rant at no one in particular. I'm watching several different mothers-to-be online cope with waiting for labor to begin, and trying to be supportive has prompted a lot of reflection for me. 

I know that not everyone values natural birth, or not everyone values it as much as me. The best case scenario for any birth is for the mother to come through labor with her wishes for herself as well as those for her baby intact. Yes, women contemplating labor always wish for a healthy baby. Provided that is likely, she may wish for other things as well. The wishes have to be realistic -- there's some discomfort in birth, one way or another. But if a woman wishes for pain relief in labor, then I'm disappointed for her if she doesn't get it. Epidurals, induction, ceseareans, are all things that mothers might choose for themselves, and I support their access to those options. Getting what you wished for in a labor and birth experience is in part an achievement (the result of hard work ahead of time, and during labor), and in part luck. 

I try hard not to engage in the ""natural birth competitiveness game"" that I have seen played online... I don't want to ""one-up"" someone who had a hospital birth, or used pain meds, or had a cesarean. I am not a better person than those mothers just because I had a natural homebirth. I choose to focus on what we have in common, as mothers, rather than the differences that might separate us.

But the wish for natural childbirth is a valid wish. I don't appreciate having it pooh-poohed, which is how I feel when someone says, ""well, all that matters is that the baby is healthy, in the end."" I don't think that saying this is reassuring for someone who had a labor that went really differently than what she wished for. And I don't think it inspires mothers-to-be to expect more of themselves and of their caregivers. <lj-cut text=""This is what I mean when I say, there's so much more to a good birth than a healthy baby. "">

What else is involved in a good birth, besides a healthy baby? Let me repeat myself -- working toward the mother's reasonable wishes for labor is also integral to a good birth, whatever those wishes might be. In my case, I wished for a natural birth, and <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/skovatch/OldSite/birthstory.htm"">I gave birth at home, as planned</a>, with lay midwives, my husband, and one close friend supporting me. I can tell you without a doubt that doing so raised my self-confidence as a mother, helped me to bond with my baby, and is an exhilerating experience that I'll remember my whole life. It will be empowering for my daughter to hear that story someday, to know that her mom, who is basically a couch potato, coped through a strenuous labor in the way she chose. In preparing for the birth of my first child, I benefitted from a lot of support from women I didn't know, but who shared their experiences with me through online communities. That's why I continue to do so for others who I know only through my computer. I try to do this only when I feel the support is wanted. I don't want to push anyone into having a birth like mine, if that's not what she wishes for. 

A natural birth was something I wanted, and I got it, but it didn't just happen. I did my best to surround myself with support that would treat my wish as a valid one, right alongside my wish for a healthy baby. (For another example of how much work it takes to manage your support system so you can have a natural birth, this one in the hospital, read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=birthstories&itemid=6775"">Thotkonstrukt's account</a> of <lj user=""quiltpunk"">'s labor and the birth of Violette. You'll see what I mean. Something as simple as taking the hospital clock down from the wall can change the way your professional caregivers interact with you quite profoundly. Thinking to ask which of the nurses might be most aligned with your wishes, and maneuvering to get her assigned to you, or vice versa, is a lot of work, but may be worthwhile.) 

I want to advocate on behalf of first-time mothers. They especially need and deserve support in wishing for more than just a healthy baby. The first time a woman gives birth, she's giving birth to herself as a mother, as well as to her child. The way she approaches birth and the kind of support she receives will help to shape the mother she will become. I mourn with every new mother who wishes for natural birth and does not see her wish fulfilled, either because the way the labor unfolded did not permit her wish to come true, or because that wish was not respected by her caregiver. I mourn wishes blocked by fate, but I mourn the ones blocked by professionals acting in their routines even more.

So, forgive me if I start getting cranky when I hear people saying, ""well, I did X because that's what my doctor (or midwife) recommended."" I get really frustrated when I hear people subordinating themselves blindly to their doctors. As a professional myself, I know that professionals are human, we are overworked, we sometimes make mistakes, and it's hard to give each person we interact with personal attention... especially if our clients hold us in awe and abdicate responsibility for assessing our recommendations and choosing to follow or to question them. It's up to you as a client to remind the professional of your wishes, repeatedly if necessary, and to do your own homework about recommended interventions before you consent. 

There's a fine line between respecting your caregivers' training and wisdom, and promoting them from your advisors to your dictators. Professionals are advisors -- you choose them for their specialized skills, but they should use those skills in service of your desires, not just their own convenience. You want a basically trusting relationship, but that doesn't mean that you just give them trust -- they continue to earn it, over the course of the relationship, by responding to your specific situation, questions, needs, and desires. The best birth professionals understand this, and treat questions that may seem to challenge their recommendations as part of the ongoing trust-building process."

"event","This was written June 7, 2002, but is post-dated to 2009 so that you see it first if you come across my journal and are not on my LJ-friends list.
<lj-cut>
""Where Mama Writes"" is a personal journal, a place where I can share the ups and downs of my life with others who also share their lives with me through the web. I like the feel of having mutual LJ friends, folks who comment on my journal as I am commenting on theirs. It helps me feel less alone, in this busy life I lead, with real-life friends who are even busier than I am. Because I like the feel of mutual commenting, my journal is friends-only. I'm leaving some of the posts from my first few weeks of journaling in public mode, so you can get some sense of what the rest of my journal is like.

<bold>Here's what to do if you want to read the most recent entries in my journal</bold>: 
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/create.bml"">get a LiveJournal account</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=55"">create a journal of your own</a>, check out the old public entries in my journal, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=mamawrites&mode=full"">read my profile</a>, and if you are still interested in reading my journal, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=41"">add me as a friend</a>. I'll notice you when I'm tweaking my profile, which I do every month or two.  If I have time to read your journal, and sense the potential for connection, I'll comment in your journal and add you back as a friend.
</lj-cut>
On LJ ""friends"": <lj-cut> Most days, I feel like the only friend I get to see regularly is my husband, so I take Livejournal friends seriously. I'm loyal. It can sometimes be hard for me to take people off my list once I've added them. And I don't like when my friends are mean to each other or feed drama online.  On the other hand, LiveJournal is also my place to play and flirt, so sometimes I go on binges of adding people because they seem like the kind of folks I might chat with at a picnic. If you read a few of my entries and I seem like someone you might invite to a picnic or a knitting group, great -- add me back! If I seem like someone you might walk away from and then later point out to your SO, saying ""she tried to talk to me, but she's a bit... intense!"" then don't add me back (or take me off your list if you want)."

"event","We spent a happy afternoon in the backyard today, with my husband cleaning out the garage to make room for the minivan, my daughter flitting from sandbox to new slide (purchased at a garage sale yesterday) to beach chair (ditto), and myself actually planting some herbs for the first time in four years or so (dill, sage, thyme, basil, and purple basil). Then I was able to enjoy last summer's mother's day gift, finally assembled -- a hammock stand for my hammock -- while my husband took my daughter out for a drive.

Because of her early nap today and the copious outdoor activities this afternoon, our little one fell asleep while nursing before dinner, so we had a quiet spaghetti supper with wine, breadsticks and salad (in a new wooden salad bowl, another garage sale find).

Now I'm off to search the web for tips about buying carseats for the toddler stage... so that we will be prepared when we pick up the car tomorrow afternoon!"

"event","So being bored at work and having nothing to do has led me to the colorstrology website.  apparently there is a color for each day of the year and based on your birthday, the color tells you your personality traits.  so it would seem that i am vineyard green.  funnily enough green is my favorite color and i am wearing it right now.  apparently there has been a reason all along and the traits that were listed were very right on to me.  maybe it's not all bs.

Went out last night with my new friend c.  not much happened but good times were had.  it seems that every shitty job i have makes up for it somehow by giving me a cool person to hang out with.  i guess that it's the employment karma trying to make up for the fact that i don't have health insurance so at least my mental health is fine.  who knows?

i am so tired, but in a much better place than my last entry.  feeling a bit foolish due to the fact that i overreacted but was correct in assuming that j was freaking out.  it has all been happening so fast between us that we have decided to slow down a bit.  truth is that if we had been moving at a regular pace, then i never would have had my mini-meltdown/pity party the other night because he wouldn't have been such a presence in my life yet.  it is never simple, is it?"

"event","here i go after too much beer and a dial free lifestyle so that i cannot vent my frustrations on the man in question.  i know that he won't read this so fuck!!!! why do i always fall for these freaks?  okay so maybe i am asking for too much, but is it so much to ask for a returned phone call?  we slept together, he met my friends and gave the impression to them that he would be around and then nothing. i would much rather hear the it's not you,it's me speech than nothing.  what happened to common courtesy? i fucking hate this. i am tired of this shit.  i am a good girlfriend.  i am not clingy, i cook and i have been told on several occasions that i am good in bed (not including the times that i have been told that i am an amazing kisser) when a gay guy tells you that you are a good kisser, you tend to believe it....
i hate this.  i keep myself closed off for a reason and then when i open myself up, then i get someone who is either playing me or freaking out. i am tired of this shit.  there is a reason that i date 24-year-olds, i know what i am getting myself into. i enjoy them  for what they have to offer without the true emotional attachment, but then i let myself fall for someone my own age and they pull the same old crap....
i blew off a beautiful man that probably would do this same shit for j and now i am wishing that i didn't.  at least with him, i have a better idea of where i stand, ok so i know that him having seen me with j is driving him crazy, but whatever. he has had his chances and now wants me more becuase he thinks that i am with j, but that is the thing. j is pulling this shit so i am sure that it is over.  fuck....."

So my best friend got married.  I am really happy for her but a little jealous too.  By no means am I ready to married, but it would be nice to meet someone that I didn't see as a temporary diversion.  Why do your friends' actions make you question your life?  Maybe it's just life in Los Angeles that I am questioning.  There is such a different mindset here.  Everyone is so transient or focused on their career that it leaves no time to develop any real relationships.  I am so thankful for the friends' that I have here.  I was lucky.

Spent a few days with lizard.  Had fun even though I fell on numerous occasions and injured myself.  it was just like the old days of when we lived together.  i didn't realize how much i missed her until we finally got to spend more than 12 hours together.  she's a good egg, that one.

Why does it never fail that the moment you leave town you meet a really nice guy? ok, maybe even more than one.  not only did i end up making out with the best man, hence the cliche since i was the maid of honor although my honor certainly was in need of defense; but i ended up with one of the waiters at the reception.  i was amazed at my trashy behavior, but since i don't make a habit of behaving that way I am not going to worry about it.  Here's the rub in all of this.  The waiter from the reception was really sweet.  of course he said he was going to call. i am not holding my breath, but there is a small part of me that wants him to call.  i cannot figure it out since i certainly do not want to get involved in another long distance relationship.  why do i always do this to myself? can i please meet someone who actually lives in the same state, let alone the same town?  i think that i am falliing back into my pattern of safe men, unavailable in some way that prevents me from making a real commitment."

I had nightmares of the crowds of pseudo-hippie frat boys that used to go to the shows at the Georgia Theater.  It was not a place that I would be.  So imagine my surprise when I found myself in the 10th row at Dodgers Stadium watching Dave Matthews Tuesday night and actually had a good time.  My friend grew up with Stefan, the bassist so we had really good seats.  Of course I know the reason it was so much fun was that I was with my pals and it was free, but a good time was had.  Plus Wes Bentley was sitting in the row ahead of us and seeing him in person made me realize that my ex was so much better looking than him as well as being a foot taller.  No longer will my heart be tinged with regret when I see his movies.  

On top of my exciting night at Dodgers Stadium, I have been continuing my madcap descent into  debauchery.  Alex and I cannot seem to stop and I think my liver would thank me if I took a break.

the rest of the weekend was enjoyable as well.  i met another bass player.  i swear that i must give off some sort of pheromone where they are concerned.  he was cute though and thankfully does not live in this town.  Sh seemed to be quite disturbed by this.  i guess it is apparent that i really was just using him for sex and now it seems to be driving him crazy...guys really do suck that way


so i am now letting my friend stay on my couch until she gets settled here in los angeles.  i really don't know how this is going to go.  i love her dearly, but it is really the wrong time for me to have a house guest.  i am slammed at work and the last thing i want to do is to have to entertain.  i should have told her to delay a week until things calmed down here, but as usual i didn't .  she is aware though that i don't know how long i can do this.  my place is just too small for two people who are not sleeping together  and Buster to live for an extended period of time...hopefully she will find a job soon and then an apartment so that she will be settled here.  does wishing her visit with me to be short make me a bad friend?  miss cherry tomatah says that she has a three day limit on visitors, no exception.  i don't know if i need my limit to be that short, but i am thinking about having one."

other things happening...once again ending up at my local haunt last night.  i cannot seem to stay away even when i have the best intentions.  i got a boy's perspective on me and my partner in crime, the infamous miss cherry tomatah.  in his words, she is a player, but i am an innocent...if he only knew.  i am curious though as to why people always want  to protect me and view me this way.  i can definitely take care of myself, but i know that i can be a little too trusting at times.  i just don't think anything is wrong in expecting the best from people."

"event","I have been trying to write in my journal for a couple of days now, but every time I have attempted to access it, there have been technical difficulties...
oh my life, what a silly thing it is....well i am past my brief fling with the boy with the hindu name. sweet, but a drunk and that means in terms of actual sex, not very fulfilling. of course, i was very understanding about the whole thing, but in the back of my mind, i was yelling FUCK!!  To have gone this long without sex and then to finally have it again and have it be a tad disappointing is very frustrating.  What's even more confusing is that I had a dream about S last night.  We did not get back together by any means.  He simply responded to the accusations in my letter.  I guess that is probably the closest thing I will get to that actually happening.  He's a coward and a big disappointment to me since I fell so head over heels in love with him and he professed to have done the same...I have been doing a lot of thinking about my past relationships and have come to the following conclusion:  I have a tendency to fall for inappropriate or emotionally unavailable men because ultimately they are safe for me.  I seem to know that I won't truly put myself out there.  If I do though, I guess that I know that I will get over them.  It has taken me awhile to let go of S even after he treated me so poorly after my gf's funeral.  The memory of him was stronger than reality."

"event","I wish that this week would be over so that I can have my life back.  I love my job, but it is taking over my life.  This is nothing new.  I am just feeling overwhelmed...It is even affecting my judgement since I am thinking about calling Shambo about a rematch, in other words, a fuck.  He is really sweet but I probably lost all chance of a realtionship when I slept with him the first night I met him....hmmm, probably not a wise move on my part.  well hopefully, i can at least fun with him one more time.  It would make things so much easier if he knew that I am too busy for anything else.  Of course, he will probably act like a typical guy and assume the worst.  who knows?  he may surprise me"

Baby's been a bad, bad girl...I cannot get that song out of my head, well maybe I've modified it a little to suit my past weekend.  I haven't had this much fun for awhile.  I made out with two different boys within three days of each other  as well as flirting like a bandit.  i don't really think that a flirting bandit is an expression regularly used, but I like it.  I am so bad.  The boy from last night was so adorable and Buster loved him.  I must say that he scored points when he didn't complain that I was basically being spooned by him on one side and Buster on the other.  Of course, it was totally one of those situations where we can either hang out again or not,  supposedly we are supposed to have a rematch...we'll see...he so busted me on my hickey from the other night....I know that all of this is so frivolous, but I have been in hiding forever.  It's amazing how past relationships can just fuck you up.  By writing the ex a letter last week basically telling him what a coward he was, freed something in me...plus the whole dumped before the date thing made me crave attention...well I definitely got it....I have a feeling that I am going to get in a lot of trouble this summer"

"event","So my incredible day yesterday continued into the night.  I came home to a house full of feathers.  It turns out that my pup decided to have a pillow fight with himself.  You never realize just how many feathers are in a pillow until you see them on your floor...It was actually really funny for about five minutes until I started to clean it up...."

"event","Can I please meet a man that is normal?  Just when I thought that my luck was changing....I am so easily fooled.  So I was supposed to go out with this guy I met last weekend this week.  We have a couple of nice conversations on the phone and he tells me that he will call yesterday and let me know what nights he doesn't have to work so that we can go out.  Then when I am home this afternoon walking my dog, he has left me a message.....basically saying that he is weird and not in a place right now to go out with anyone.  You know that is fine and dandy although I wish that I had known that before he had asked me out....You would think that a 40 year old man would have his shit worked out...I try to break my bad habits by going out with someone who doesn't fall into my normal categories and this is what happens...That's it. I am back to dating musicians...at least with them, I have a pretty good idea about what I am getting into....So I was feeling pretty crappy after getting that phone message, but fortunately that mood was brief.  At the gas station, I had a van full of cute rock boys flirt with me as well as another cute boy in a Volvo so at least my self esteem is OK....I can still attract the hot men...now if I only could have sex with one of them...my morals are now out the window...come on, casual sex...."

In what has been what seems like a long time of never meeting any interesting men, they all seemed to rain on me this weekend.  maybe alex and i were giving off some kind of phermones.  not that i am complaining, i hope that this kind of attention continues because flirting is fun!!!"

"event","so this is my first entry having been turned on by my friend lizard.  hopefully i will be more successful at keeping this than i have been in writing in my journal lately.  

i am having a moment of crisis right now,  there are so many unknowns in my life right now, with work and life.  i know that i normally welcome challenges and change, but i want to be settled right now.  maybe it has something to do with my best and oldest friend getting married soon to a guy that i introduced her to. 
 
i am in this weird mode.  I had a conversation with my sister the other day about how i didn't want to be in a relationship just to be in a realtionship, that i was fine being alone.  this is all true, but it seems like the healthiest and most fulfilling relationship i have had recently has been with my dog.  how do i get off this merry-go-round of bad relationships?  does anyone have a solutions?  i keep telling myself that if I stop dating musicians that it will  make a difference.  but honestly, half of the time i never know that they are in a band when i meet them.  maybe they are just a way of me avoiding commitment & growing up. 
all of this is nothing that i haven't thought of before.  i need to do something though.  i keep trying to take pictures, but i never seem to have time these days.  my days are consumed with work and when i am not working, i am either trying to catch up with friends and my dog or i am too tired.
what is a poor girl supposed to do?"

sunday- mothers day michelle spent the night saturday and then we went to wal mart to get my mom something for mothers day and we went to the shoes after i found a card cuz i wanted to see the sandals then there was just one mexican..i started reading the card to michelle and i turned around and there were two mexicans then three i was like what the hell lets get outta here so we started walking and they flipping followed us around wal mart so we lost them in the garden place then we walked back up to where the school stuff is and then we ran in to them so i was like wtf and we cut off into the womans clothing place and they stopped and looked at us so we hid behind a rack of clothes kinda weird then we saw my dad and we bolted to get to him..we got home and then everyone came over the whole family and some friends..today was pretty cool..well i gotta go everyone wants me to go and play volleyball..

peace out bitches

So then we were all stuffed and my mom said that we should get our food now and so we did LG got chicken fingers and fries and i got a cheese burger and fries..but my mom being a retard told me to throw away the trash so i did..i got back to my seat and she asked if i got my burger and i said no so then she said that i threw it away so all i had was fries and half of a chicken finger that LG couldnt finsh..that was great..about 5 minutes later there was a rain delay..so me and LG took a ""walk"" out to the car but we didnt go to the car we went to a bus stop thing and chilled..hehe..and my mom calls like 20 minutes later and said that we were leaving..so we go and get home then every one that we were with at the game was at my house with my puppies..and so me and LG didnt want to go inside rite then so we went to the corn field and the grass stuff was wet so our pants were wet all the up to our knees just about..well like half way up our shins..and our shoes and everything was went..LG was flipping out b/c she saw the farmers head lights and she thought that he was coming in the corn field so she bolted..it was funny i was laughing my ass off and so was she..it was great..</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>Sunday not much happened i just did homework and watched tv..then at like 5:30 my mom called the sheltie puppy owners and they said that they sold them all so i told my mom that we should just look for puppies on the internet and she told me to do it so for like the whole rest of the night i was looking up puppies..we found a few that were really cute but they were in like montana or florida and we didnt want to get one far away and my mom wanted a female so finally we found one in virgina but it was $500 and a male..it was sooooo cute so now we are debating on getting it or keep looking...</FONT></P>

"event","<P>well last week went by very slow! </P>
<P>thursday night: i talked to josh until 1 in the morning...pretty cool i guess </P>
<P>friday: we had a pep rally and josh sat in front of me and we kinda flirted a lil bit</P>
<P>saturday night:&nbsp;me and my dad watched the village that is sooo dumb i didnt understand that movie at all i screamed one time though i think it was when the red thing was far away and then the blind girl was hiding behind the tree and then the next thing u know it was rite there so that made me scream but i didnt understand it&nbsp; </P>
<P>today : today was awesome..josh told me to go to the corn field behind me house and meet him out there so i took my dog out to the corn field and when i saw josh coming up i told my dog to go get him she didnt know who it was so she started being all big and bad barking and growling it was funny then she saw that it was josh and ran over to him and jumped on him with her muddy paws..when i walked over to him i asked y he made me come out to the corn field and he said that it was two things but i had to pick one so he said A or B and i picked B and he asked me out..thats what he did in 8th grade when he asked me out he told me to pick A or B and i picked B then too..so i said yes to him..then like and hour after we were just hanging out in the corn field my dad called and asked where i was and i said in the corn field so then i had to go back because i had to get ready to go up to my sisters for my nephews birthday dinner with the family when we got to her house Rick ( my cousin that got devorsed ) was there with Michelle ( his oldest daughter ) and Kaley ( his youngest ) Kaley doesnt live with Rick and i havent seen her since like august of 2004 so its been a while she was so cute she grew alot and is still soo skinny she is only 5..so today was a great day..i got asked back out by josh and got to see my lil cousin!</P>
<P>now i got to go and finish my geometry make up work from when i was out for 3 days still havent finished that i still have 5 more pages to do..fun fun!</P>

"event","<P>well the drama queen is back..this guy has been saying that im fat and ugly...i already thought that about myself but hearing it come from someone rite to my face that sucks the thing is i thought i was friends with him..and i could understand him joking around saying im ugly and fat but he hasnt even said sorry yet..it makes me think more that im fat and ugly..and i already thought that with out having someone say it to me..nobody even said i was fat or ugly to my face..now that someone has..makes me think less bout myself less that i already do..and thats pretty bad...cuz i didnt think it could get any lower..but i guess it could cuz it already has..and all my friends are getting mad at me for saying that im fat and ugly but i cant help it..im just very insecure about myself and i know i have to change that but i cant and i dont know why..there isnt anyone who could make me feel good about myself..i may look happy in school but im not..i am never happy..nothing i do will make me happy..well i guess thats just life?</P>

"event","<P>i guess things are going back to what they used to be..everyone hating me..i guess i should be used to it?..but idk..i have been feeling more and more insecure about myself..after what my ex boyfriend ((josh wood)) said to me..how every time he sees me he wants to barf..after he said that to me..its kinda hard to think differently i really do feel like im ugly but then ppl tell me im not..idk maybe im making too much outta something small..or maybe im just being a drama queen..but what ever it is im doing..its how i feel..i thought everything was fine with me and brandon too..but now im starting to think differently...it just seems like he just wants to stop all communication with me..i think im over reacting on that one but not with josh..he wants nothing to do with me so i am going to give it to him..im going to stop everything that i did..and i wont talk to him..maybe then he will be happy that im outta his life..but i hope that doesnt happen with me and brandon..i really dont think i could put up with that one..it feels like im falling farther and farther apart with Erica too..god i dont like this feeling..</P>

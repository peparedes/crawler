"event",":heavenly. for amy.

				
i will my thoughts parallel
to the distance between stars
that cannot be as bright as they were
when i was younger but
when it is colder outside
they seem closer and less furious
i know tears more noticable than the stars
or smiling fond heaven found
					
the powerlines still reverberate
a still noise
and when i stare upwards
the moon is a half-dissolved head and
sometimes my thoughts become earth tones
parallel to the force cloaked behind trees in warmer climates
i will my thoughts conjoined
or can be still but shifting
waiting for ambience against noise

the heat comes and falls			
heavenly is a transition subtly
feather light and glistening grass
ennui is ice was glass
in the months before"

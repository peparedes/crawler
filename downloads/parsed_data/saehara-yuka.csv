One more thing,I found out that Karen knows K,Kev,Bob,Courtney,Nate,Rob,& Ryan o_O; She also supposedly made out with Bob(hasn't everyone?:P)and dated Ryan(lucky whore). That's so fucking nuts. Heh,Bob doesn't even *remember* her though >D

She hugged Dustin. She got a hug from Dustin simply by asking. I feel like such a cunt >_O I give in. I'm gonna confess tomorrow. No matter what. Otherwise I'll lose my fucking mind.

I am so in love with <b>Something Corporate</b>. I've been downloading a shitload of their music lately. Don't get me wrong. I've heard of them/heard them before now. I just never really fell for them :)

Had Photography today. I know how to enlarge negatives and develope them. I feel special. I made 2 prints of pictures of Dustin. I might have Tracye scan one for you all to see. Max took the pic and showed me how to do it all. I'm really glad I have him around to help ^^

Wish me luck for tomorrow. I feel like I'm going to need it. I am <i>such a pussy</i>. I thought that he was like every other crush. That I could get over him just-like-that. Apparently not :\ I need him to turn me down or *something*. Anything but this constant confusion. Feh.

<b>Artist</b>: Something Corporate
<b>Title</b>: Punk Rock Princess(Heroine)

<i>Maybe when the room is empty, maybe when the bottles full,
maybe when the door gets broke down love can break in.Maybe when I'm done with thinking, maybe you can think me whole,
maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin.(this can begin,this can begin)

If you could be my punk rock princess I could be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in and how you're 'gonna be something.

Maybe when your hair gets darker, maybe when your eyes get wide,
maybe when the walls are smaller there will be more space.
Maybe when I'm not so tired, maybe you could step inside,
maybe when I look for things that I can't replace.(i can't replace,i can't replace)

If you could be my punk rock princess I could be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in and how you're 'gonna be something.If I could be your first real heartache I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess, I would be your heroine.

I never though you'd last, I never dreamed you would.
You watch your life go past, you wonder if you should.

She should be my punk rock princess so I would be your garage band king.
You should tell me why you just don't fit in and how you're 'gonna be something!
If I could be your first real heartache I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess, I would be your heroine!

Woah-oh-you-know~
Woah-oh-you-know~you just can't let it sink in!
you could be my heroine!
you could be my heroine!</i></lj-cut>"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dustin ate lunch with us of his own accord. I never talked to him about you-know-what. I've decided that's there is no reason too. I shouldn't be such a cunt. I'm quite sure that he is aware of the situation.

I'm simply going to see if he'll make a move. In a few weeks I will ask him out if he hasn't said a word about it yet. No I don't have any real reason to believe that he likes me. But,I should have more confidence. Yes I am roughly 10 pounds over weight. No I'm not a beauty queen.

The fact of the matter is that besides that I still have a personality and interests that I love and that many other people also enjoy. If he doesn't then that's up to him. If that's the case then I'll just try to enjoy a friendship with him(which won't exactly be hard since he's a great guy).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In other news I got an apology from Mrs.Weiser(ceramics)withought any trouble getting stirred up. Then I changed from her class into Photography. The class I originally wanted to join but was told was too full. I'm glad. It gives me another class w/Max which is cool and I like Photo. alot.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That's essentially all that I've got to say. Oh yeah,at lunch we were goofballs(me,Dustin,Tracye,& Max). Max kicked a can which hit Tracye and I *BOTH* in the head. We all just about cried because we laughed so hard. After that when we went to Life Drawing together(yes the 4 of us have that class as well as others together)we were still acting goofy so the teacher accused us of being stoned ::LOL::.

"event","In my opinion it's pointless for both me _and_ all of you to have me type up every single detail of every single day of my rather dull life. Therefore I have decided that hence forth I shall do essentially what <b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/nigi/"">nigi</a></b> does. To put it simply I will be typing out _only_ the highlights in no particularly structured manner *BUT* it will be formatted so that it *doesn't* end up like this --- 'My mom. OMG that sucked. Meatloaf is cool.' XD

So here it goes~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I really think that Max has a crush on me. He was acting strange today....-_- ::worry::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At lunch Dustin didn't sit with us. So,since I'm a loser,I sought(sp?)him out. It was easy to find him. We chatted for a bit. I'm pretty sure that he was annoyed by this and that I came across as an idiot. Not to mention I have this weird suspicion that I blushed for some portion of the convo. -____-;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My ceramics teacher gave me crap and told Savaglio(the principal)that I was a trouble maker and that I had tried to get out of Study Hall yesterday. She was falsely accusing me. The fact of the matter is that I was simply given false information. I didn't inconvienience *anyone*.

Not to mention I wasn't bullshitting anyone like she claimed that I was. She told Savaglio that I was so on and so forth. He believed her(in part because he thought that she was referring to another Laura)and called me into his office. After I explained things to him(not in detail mind you. for example i didn't tell him that she's hated me/been biased towards me since day 1 of the class)he said that he would straighten things out and that he would talk to her.

He did in fact talk to her. Wee.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I ended up going home early. In part because I was obsessing over the Dustin incident. Also in part because of the fact that I wanted to watch <b>DOA:A Right of Passage</b>. You see I don't have a *working* VCR in my bedroom so I have to use my parents'. I can only do that when they're not home. Therefore I had to come home early to do so.

My mother asked me why I came home early. Somewhere along the line she misunderstood my reasons,and got mad to the nth at the ceramics teacher. We got off the phone and she called Savaglio X_X They talked about it and so now my mum is going to my school on monday to ""make that bitch appologize"" because she doesn't ""deal with people pulling shit on her kids"".

::sigh:: I hope Savaglio doesn't think I'm being a pussy. I'm really not. Although I still am mad at Mrs.Weiser(ceramics teacher)and I hope she gets mad because of this :) Now I can switch into another class no problem. Heh.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I watched <b>DOA</b>. It was really good. It had alot fo stuff with <b>The Sex Pistols</b> & <b>Generation X</b> *.* On that tape there is also the first volume of <b>The Lifestyles of The Ramones</b>. I haven't watched all of that yet but I shall. It's interesting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I rented <b>American Pie 2</b>. I hadn't seen it for a long time and my sister is having a friend sleep over so they rented movies thus I took advantage of the opportunity. I haven't watched it yet though.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm talkin to Max & Brandon on AIM right now.....hrm.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<b>The Damned</b> 0wNZ~j00~PH34R!>D NOTE:\\I've been listening to them constantly since I got the CD's from Scottie. I'm going to ask him for some more :3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Max is having a birthday party tomorrow. He invited Tracye and I. I might go. Not sure yet.

Not to mention those groups weren't formed by us. I really enjoy hanging out w/Max & Dustin :) I have no issues w/them whatsoever and they are teh funneh@hotmail.com.

The only other things that I can say about my day is that-it was good+an A day. Oh yeah and Hector is no longer Tracye&I's study hall teacher which blows royally. Instead it's Mrs.Melton. It suX0rZ. I got so bored in there today. Feh.

I ended up asking to go to the bathroom and running into Ray,Max,Cheese-boi,and a few other peeps in the main gallery(i go to an art school which doubles as an art gallery btw :P). We stood around chatting it up for 40+ minutes. By the time we were done it was 3:23 and school lets out at 3:30 O_o So~Max and I got our asses back to class and I had him tell Tracye to get my bag out of the room for me XD

While he was doing so I ran into Dustin. I told him what had happened and he laughed his arse off :P G00ber~ That kids fab-u-lous tho'. He makes me laugh non-stop. He's kyute in this endearing d0rk-tastic way(hur). He's uber-weird,he likes <b>Jhonen Vasquez(JTHM,etc.)</b>,he likes <b>Linkin Park</b>,he also likes alot of other music that I like(including some great old school stuff),he's a drawing major(LIKE ME!)and he's fucking *great* at it.

I know I talk about him alot. I suppose I shouldn't get my hopes up. Knowing the school I attends reputation he's quite possibly gay. Not to mention even if he's not I am teh 00gleh. <b>I strongly doubt that he would ever be interested in a hobbit like me ^^;</b>

Bah. Oh yes one more thing. I read the first volume of <b>Demon Diary</b>. I *really* liked/like it. I'm gonna read the other one later tonight.

With all that said,I'm out like sour trout."

"event","I've said it before and I'll say it again: Scottie 0wnZ~
I finally got the CD's he said he would send today :) They are as follows:

<center><u>Band</u>           -           <u>CD Title</u>
<b>Public Image Limited. - Live@Mesa Ampitheatre(recorded by Scottie the lucky bastard!~!I <3 P.i.L to the nth :x)

The Damned - The Light @ the End of the Tunnel(<3 the damned)

Lords of the New Church - Killer Lords(haven't ever heard of them nor have i listened to it yet)

Social Distortion - Mommy's Little Monster(fuck yes,SOCIAL DISTORTION IS CLASSIC BABY! YEAH!)</b></center>

So yeah I'm a happy camper :) He also gave me <b>D.O.A. - A PuNK RoCK Right 0f Passage</b>(on VHS)which  I have been wanting to see for an eternity~ Tonight we talked on the phone about punk and our views on it(amongst other things)for like an hour >D I feel like such a lame ass pfft ^^;

In other news~ I'm sorry that I haven't been updating lately. As I said before it's hard to find a way to get on for more than 10-15 mins and normally the first thing that I do when I do get on is read everyone's blogs & check my e-mail sooooooooo~ you know the score.

So I have been talking to Max & Dustin alot more lately. My crush on Dustin is developing more and more everyday..........as for Max he's really kewl. He *gave* me the new <b>Adam Green</b> CD which 0wnZ~j00 XD I have a rearranged schedule btw~here it is:

<b><u>A Days</u>
Physics(Tracye,Dustin,Max,Whitney,Katie*)
Drawing Advanced(Tracye,Annie,Katie,Heather,Ray,etc.)
Life Drawing Intermediate(Dustin,Max,Tracye)
Study Hall(Tracye,Katie)

<u>B Days</u>
Contemporary Humanities 1-2(Dustin,Max,Alex,Spike,etc.)
Algebra 1-2(Becca)
Ceramics(Kim,Max,Brandon)
Painting(Kim,Katie)</b>

Tadah. I think that I'm finally satisfied. Now I have 3 classes w/Dustin,3 or 4 classes w/Max(technically he just hangs out w/me in ceramics even though he has photo that hour),& 4 classes w/Tracye. Not to mention plenty of classes w/ other nifty people.

I really want to hang out w/eat lunch w/Dustin+Tracye+Max everyday. I got Dustin to eat w/us today :D I was so proud. I hope that he gets in the habit of doing that. Max seems to be. It's kewl-to-the-Nth.

The only other thing that I can think of to say is that Dustin is h0t and I <3 him@hotmail.com. Yes I know that I'm a d0rk ;) Oh yeah~ AND I saw Michelle the other day. Crazy stuff. She looked nice but,very different :P

Lastly,I do realize that I change my schedule alot. I also realize that I seem redundant at times. You know what though? <b>This is *my* journal I can say whatever I want in whatever way that I wish as frequently as my little heart desires. DEAL W/iT</b>

Oh yes and Katie(she's so nice~)let me borrow this manga that I've wanted to read for awhile. It's called <b>Demon Diary</b>. I haven't gotten to read it yet(she gave it to me today)but the art looks superb so~ yeah.

"event","Hrm. Chello my homies. It is once again the weekend. Wee~fun.

I started it off with a bang :) Yesterday was a 1/2 day @ sk00l so Tracye,Katie,Annie,Christy-anne,Alex,Heather,Heathers mum,Whitney,& myself decided to eat lunch 2gether @ <b>E! Ba</b>;an asian 'cafe' w/_smashing_ f00d ;D We sat around eating+talking for 1-2 hours. It was really nice.

<lj-cut text=""What Happened After the Cafe w/the Anime KidZ & I"">After that Heather& her mum left. The rest of us walked next door to a comic shop and looked around. They have *really* cheap anime VHS's and there were these cheap digital <b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</b> watches there as well. Tracye and I plan on going back to buy a couple movie's and a Michelangelo watch for me + a Donatello one for her XD

Next up was <b>Borders</b>. I didn't really want to go there -_- I found myself being _very_ bored. Not to mention Tracye's father was supposed to pick the 2 of us up in 30-45 mins @ that point. You see Tracye's parents are _very_ paranoid and restrictive about where she goes,what she does,& with whom <<; So we wanted to make sure that we had enough time to walk from <b>Borders</b> to <b>Plush</b>(more on it in a min)which was where her pops was picking us up.

Luckily we got out of there pretty fast.[-(note: i am uber glad that my parents don't care where i go as long as i have at least 1 person w/me and as long as i'm home by 12am :P)-]We made it to <b>Plush</b> w/plenty of time. I <3 that store. I had heard of it before but I had never been there. To make a long description short it's like a 2 story <b>Hot Topic</b> that is *not* in a mall and has _far_ better products :)

I ended up buying a Johnny Rotten pin(w00t)& a pin that reads:


<center><b> FUCK YOU 
 YOU FUCK </b></center>


I <3 them :3

10-20 mins later her dad picked us up and we went back to her house for awhile.  We ended up jumping into her mums car and driving for 40-60 mins to arrive at a bridal shop where Tracye had to try on dresses(her sister is getting married in a few months). Normally this would be lame but because we were being such goof balls it was a blast. <b>We were both in fabulous moods >D</b>

After that was said and done it was 9 or 9:30 so we decided to get some dinner. It took forever for us to get Tracye to agree on something(she's a rather picky eater. i'm not being a bitch or anything,i am too...but *still*). We ended up at a mexican restraunt called <b>Macayo's</b>.

We had all eaten there before except for Tracye. It was good. We had chips&salsa&spinach+cheese dip. Tracye and I also split a big ass(vegetarian friendly)burrito & the 4 of us(her mum,sister,tracye,& i)split some fried ice-cream. It was lovely.

After that we dropped off her sister,stopped by Tracye's house real fast to pee etc. then we went to rent movies. Tracye and I wandered around like jackasses for 20 mins before we decided that we didn't feel like watching a movie -_O Finally we went back to her home. We sat around/layed around in her room talking and being idiots(just like the rest of the day)until around 3 am when we finally went to sleep.

She ended up waking earlier than me(sorta)and she felt sick. My mum arrived at around 10:30am to pick me up and just then Tracye vomited. I felt bad that she was sick. She gets sick rather frequently(blah blah blah she's not bulemic or anything like that,she has a combination of anxiety/personality disorders & mild acid reflux -_-)it's blah.
</lj-cut>

So yeah once i got home i got showered and changed then i worked on cleaning my room. I decided that(like Tracye)i'm going to sell as much of my anime stuff(that i don't want anymore)to the anime kidz @ school so that i can make money for the 4 birthdays that are coming up & for Christmass. So later today I'm going to make a list of what I want to sell so that I can show the people at school.

After my shower I hopped on the comp but was booted off before I could accomplish anything(not to mention I was in the middle of talking to Dax and I didn't get to say goodbye x_x). After that my mum yelled at me to go finish cleaning my room and to help her unload/put away the grocerys that she had bought. I did that and was _very_ dissapointed that she bought me damn near none of the things that i asked for. It seemed like she ' convienently ' forgot that <b>I'M A VEGETARIAN</b>. Bah.

Oh well,I g2g now. She's being weird again. Besides this has been _far_ to long,not to mention,I'm afraid that she might pull something _again_.

With all that said,<b>I'm out like sour trout.</b>"

Wee.

Got home from school early today(2:00).
Working on a project in Painting(FINALLY). It's going to be Pop-Art-esque. Good times. Speaking of Painting,I don't think that I've mentioned that I'm in an Independant Study version of the class. Therefore,I get to paint whatever the fuck I want(basically)and I have no due dates. It pwnz.

Also-on the topic of Pop-Art there's going to be an <b>Andy Warhol</b> show sometime soon. I_WANT_TO_GO_ My teacher might arrange for it to be a class feild trip :) I hope that'll go through.

My day was OK. Talked to Heather alot. IN_A_GOOD_WAY_ But yeah,since Tracye wasn't there and I didn't feel like going to Study Hall I called my dad up and bummed a ride from him.

My brain is wishy washy right now. That's why this entry might seem a little chaotic. Srry,bout that.

Tomorrow I'm going to see the new <b>David Spade</b> flick(Dickie Roberts). Good times. I <3 that man in a way I love no_other_ XD

Woot woot wee. :: cough ::

I think that Bob & Vel broke up. Vel says so. Wheeze says so. Bob hasn't mentioned it though. Curious. I wonder if he still wants my butt. For awhile now he's been saying that he felt that him and Vel breaking up sometime soon was a for sure thing and that once it finally happened that he wanted to be with me. I don't know about that. I wonder if it's still the case. If he brings it up...I don't know what I'll say.

I have a thing for that Dustin kid. He reminds me of DaX. A_lot_. I think that has something to do with it.

Mraa. I g2g. I need to cease this rambling anyway.
Ciao~"

Yuka was a name I gave myself in 5th or 6th grade. I got it from a poster that I owned. On it was a girl named Yuka(dur)she had long brown hair and huge breasts(just like me~@that time :P). I'm pretty sure that she was from a <b>SEGA Saturn</b> game/anime called <b>Variable GEO</b>.

I want to re-read <b>Harry Potter & the Prisonor of Azkaban</b>. I <3 that b00k. Ha. Tracye needs to read all the <b>Harry Potter</b> books. People who do get a cookie. <b>DO *YOU* DESERVE A C00KIE!?</b> Ask yourself that. Go on. Do it. O_O

Ahem. Sounds like my pop is home. That means it's time to swim. W00t-uh. Good times my fried-ends. <u>GOOD TIMES</u>

Oh yeah,one more thing. Some guy wants to buy my grandma's house. I'm glad. I hope everything works out with that. My mum has been really stressed since she died and if that gets taken care of that will alleviate alot of that accumulated stress. She needs that *alot*. Her blood pressure is uber high,& she's been getting _hives_

No fun.

ANYWAYZ~ SWIM TIME~!

"event","Wow,haven't updated in...3 days... Sorry about that(do any of you really *care*?). I would say that I've been busy but that's not exactly true. Just look at my schedule tho'---

Get Up(@ 7:15)
Get Dressed/Ready for School
Leave/Get to School
Stay at School from 8 to 3:30
Go to Tracye's house from 4:00 to 5:30
Get home(@ 6)
Do dishes/chores
Eat dinner/Watch tv(OC,Paradise Hotel,That 70's Show,&/or Friends)
Call Tracye(@ 9)
Go to bed @11

So as you can see the only time that I could get online would be around now(if I manage to pry my sister off the comp then)or between 9:30pm & 12am. The problem with that is that frequently Tracye and I stay on the phone for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Also,thanks to my sister,my mum locks up the comp room about 50% of the time @9.

On to other things~
School is pretty good. There's a kid named Bobby who I'm <i>strangely</i> attracted too...My classes are good. I finally am satisfied with my schedule :D Here it is-

<b><u>A Days</u>
Physics
Drawing(Advanced)
Algebra(1-2)
Life Drawing(Begining)
<u>B Days</u>
Contemporary Humanities(1-2)
Painting(Intermediate)
Ceramics(Begining)
Study Hall</b>

What else can I say about school? I hang out with Tracye thruout most of the day. Just like Fr0sh year. I eat lunch with(on a regular basis): Annie,Alex,Heather,Katie,'Chibi',Beth,Eric,Christy-anne,Tracye,& Whitney.

I really wish that I hung out w/Ray,Bobby,&/or Dustin as well as the rest of the people that I hang out w/. Unfortunately I can't dig up the nerve to speak to Bobby or Dustin. As far as Ray goes...well,he would most likely rather continue eating lunch etc. alone ^^;

Also,to tell you the truth I don't particularly enjoy eating lunch with alot of the people that I...eat_lunch_with_... -_-; I don't like Beth,'Chibi',Christy-anne,or Alex. Not to mention they are the '4nim3 kiDz'. I don't want to be placed in that catagory. Don't get me wrong,I love anime. I have since I was very young.

Keep in mind though that the definition of these people(stereotypically speaking)at my school is the following:

<b>4nim3 kiDz</b>-<i>immature,sexually frustrated,emotionally corrupt,obbsessive,unintelligent,& annoying high school students who are,in 9 out of 10 cases,female.</i>

You should be able to see why I don't want to be connected to them :)I have one final thing to add to this subject. Although I love/enjoy anime I am not obsessed. Anime is *NOT* what my live revolves around. I have _many_ other interests(to the Nth).

If I am branded as a '4nim3 kiD' then people will not be interested in talking to me about anything other than anime provided that they make the attempt to speak to me _at_all_.

Blarg. Oh well. I should cease this rambling.

<b>Underdog
Way Away
On the Brink
Starstruck
Avondale
Big Apple Heartbreak
Trembling
Finish Line
Rough Draft
Sure Shot</b>

I *really*to the Nth crave their cover of <i>Everywhere</i> but i can't fucking find it anywhere. ::le sigh:: the pain -_O Anywayz~ <i>Avondale</i> is my current fav song by them. Here's the lyrics(hooha):

<i>If you're gonna rip my heart out
Could you use a knife that's dull and rust in color
(Once I die) there will be no way that you can cover
That scar
It's hard
I know
And if I get a little blood on you
Finally the world will know you're guilty
(know you're wrong) of taking everything you've gotten from me
No heart
It's hard
I know

Mighty King of Avondale
I just can't let this go
Real life ain't no fairy tale
I just thought you should know

When you're finished with the surgery
I really hope that you will turn to me and
Tell me all about the fun you had
When you were cuttin' up...
You were cuttin' up

Mighty King of Avondale
I just can't let this go
Real life ain't no fairy tale
I just thought you should know

Living like a fairy tale
The mighty King of Avondale
It all went to his head this royalty
I stuck a knife into his back
Inventiveness is what I lack
He's always hanging up on loyalty

Mighty King of Avondale
I just can't let this go
Real life ain't no fairy tale
I just thought you should know

"event","So yesterday was the wedding. I had to work my ass off until 4 when i got my hair dyed and finally got showered and changed for the 'event'. It started at 6 and people didn't leave until 10 or 11. After the actual procession i spent most of my time in my bedroom with my uncle Robert(the one being wed)'s friend Scottie,the only cousin that i really like/relate too aka Ricki(Roberts son),& my little sister.

I'm glad about that. Scottie is my fucking hero and if he was just a wee bit younger I would fucking _marry him_ He's met <b>The Sex Pistols</b>,<b>Lynrd Skynrd</b>,<b>Pearl Jam</b>,<b>Ozzy Osbourne</b>,and a fuckload of other groups that I <3 *.*

I was listening to <b>Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols</b> and he knew _all_of_the_words_ He fucking 0wnz~! He's going to mail me a shitload of punk CD's sometime soon(he has a big ass collection of CD's and a bitchin' CD burner). I really wish he was younger. I mean,I just met him last night but he seemed like my ideal fantasy guy ya know? But the man is 35....19 years older than me. That's pretty raunchy,no?

There were alot of freaks at the wedding...alot of stanky ass people. I didn't get to talk to many of them but....blargified e_e I did talk to Ricki about some weird shit...like Grandma and masturbation o_O; So anywayz I guess Sylvia is my aunt now...crazy shit. W00 boi. She's nice and all that good rot but I'm not to sure if this marriage will last.....<<

ANYWAYZ~ Today we have to do alot of dusting and vacuuming etc. In short we have to re-clean the entire inside of the house because my mum is paranoid and because it actually did get rather diRRty. We also have a little picking up to do outside.

If all goes well it won't take long and we'll be done in time for me to(the d0rk that i am)watch Grease XD Hooha. Safe sex it's the thing to do~ 'Cause it's safe and that's good and it's sex and that's good too.

Well,with that said,I'm out like sour trout."

In a way I'm looking forward to school though. My summer hasn't exactly been fabulous. I've been bored and felt neglected by _certain_ people over the course of it. Not to mention we've had relatives over constantly,something which I hate. *AND* my grandmother <b>died</b> :(

So getting back to NSA after being gone for so long and being able to have art classes again...not to mention being able to see alot of people who I missed will be good. Also I get to show off the results of my surgery :D Oh happy day.

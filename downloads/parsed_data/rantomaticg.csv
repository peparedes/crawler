"event","""Everything happens for a reason. People change so that u can learn to let go, things go wrong so that u apprciate it when it's right, u believe in lies so u can learn whats true, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together"" - some cute girl

That is the quote that i must keep in mind.

This has been a constant struggle. Its times like this that i hate having ADD. And actually i hate having to rely on adderal to help me get my work done. The psychotic effects never help. And ... actually, the only side effect that does sometimes help is the appetite suppressant-sometimes. I wish my mind wouldnt flair on all cylinders like this though. i wish i could stop part of it, because when i stop, it doesnt. I have to constantly ask myself if im thinking about a subject too much, and if the problem is real or just in my head. 

having ADD has never helped my self esteem. In everything i do, everyone seems to pick up on things faster than me. I wind up feeling slow and stupid and wondering why, if im so smart, am i the only one who seems to be struggling with getting something that seems to be easily attainable. 

One great example from the past is playing pool. I really struggled with that. It took me years to even just get decent at it, and then i'd look at my friends and see them get it in a semester or two. i felt really stupid until i understood what was going on with that. I was taking the long way. I was not playing for position like everyone else. I was becoming a shot maker and creating a database of shots in my head. i was trying to find a deeper meaning to the game. 

From that, i learned an important thing about me. I take longer to learn things because i dont hold the same constants. 

But even knowing that only helps me a little bit in other aspects of my life. The example here is getting a full time job. I know that i shouldnt be judging how im doing in comparison to others, and shouldnt be reflecting on how long its taking me but i cant help looking back on it.  Even my newly acquired ex has gotten offers. I'm happy for her and wish she'd see the good side of that, but that still makes me feel really stupid. I feel like everyone else has been let in on a secret that i never learned. i feel........ stupid.  I felt the same way  in grad school. it seemed like everyone else wasnt struggling with the things that i couldnt handle. 

Time to grow up and move on in my life.....

Stop wining. Stop blaming. Start doing. IF things work out, great! If they dont, then at least you tried. the only way to fail is to never try. Remember that."

"event","Why? WHy did she have to come out tonight?  Things are hard enough for me right now without her. why is this torturing me? I love her still. I thought i could move on. I have tried moving on- mostly for her. This hurts. This is by far the worst pain i've ever put myself through. And i still dont even understand it. Why was i removed from her life? I mean i know i didnt make her happy, but why couldnt she let me try. 

Its weird. I have moments when I think i can move on, and then i try to apply for a job, and my heart starts telling me that once i get a job things will work out and she will be back in my life. But thats not true is it. As much as i wish it were, its not.

Now i know that its over because dating is back on her status and my quotes mysteriously disappeared.... am i causing her that much pain that she's destroying all of that?

i know there is a lesson here somewhere, but i dont know what it is. all i know is that i miss her. and seeing her tonight didnt help one bit.

the worst part is that she still seems to be in pain about us separating.  it would be worlds easier if that were not the case. If she moved on completely, it would just be the case of me letting go. but its 1000 time more difficult to let someone go when you arent sure if they really want to let you go or if they want you to let them go. I still to this very day question if it was a good idea splitting up. And its not because im afraid of being single. i know i will be ok being single. After all i spent the better part of 22 years being single. it was never about that. I was always told that i was in love with the idea of having a girlfriend. That wasnt true. I loved Nancy. She was my better half. why couldnt people get that. I knew i could have someone else in my life. I only wanted her. 

But then this decision isnt about what i wanted or what i needed.  i just wish moving on in my life didnt come into play at all in the last arguements we had, because now it brings up a lot of feelings when i try to move on. why did she have to make my getting a job such a major issue.  Why did she say that if i only had a full time job all the other things could be worked out. I'm finding myself clinging to that now.  And part of me knows that its to late. and that breaks my heart more every time it occurs.

WHats the lesson here? and how many more of these will i have to go though before i finally find the person that wont break my heart like this?"

"event","Why do i keep doing this to myself. All the things i have done recently to talk to nancy have probably made my chances of ever getting back with her or even ever really just talking with her 10 to 100 times worse.... I feel like im doing the stupidity that ended my relationship with jen all over again. This sucks. I need to stop seeing what's going on in her life and just move on with mine.

Its funny that all the stuff she's doing now without me i would have loved to do with her but always got stuck in the no area.

Why are we separated anyways? Does she really not love me like i thought she was saying that she did. Does she not think about me anymore? What happened? 

I really wish that this clean break would have occured on the 15th like i originally thought it did. Right now, this week is going to be the longest week ever for me. Its spring break, but for the truly poor like me, its just another week with no events.  I cant afford to go out and have fun right now it seems.  Today was supposed to be a relaxing day where i would go out and work and then  after just have some fun. Well, the MSC is closed, so that means there is no work.  And right now i.... i just dont know. I want to go out and have fun. I actually wanted to go see pablo francisco, but its too late to buy the tickets, and idk if nancy would be  willing to take me. Actually, i dont know who she's taking, but im not sure if i can even talk to her. How she ended things hurt, but she never defined anything for me so im stuck in thins ball of confusion and i dont know whether i should just ask her about it. i dont want to ruin her life, or even her week, but i still need to talk to her. I know i should just let it go and move on. But i'm finding it very very hard to do so.

Wasnt that ticket originally for me?

i feel like im torturing myself constantly because i dont know where to go from here. I hate that she..... that we put myself in this position. I know its not just her. But her indecision and breif show of affection to me made me stop thinking that it was over and continue to believe that it will work. That part of me wont stop now. It hurts even more now since i lost my perspective on it. 

it just doesnt make sense. i mean i knew all along that she had issues about being single. And why couldnt she just say it to my face? Did she mean it. For the first time i dont like the fact that we chatted online. I cant believe that she stayed with me only because she was afraid of being single. I thought that the parts that were in conflict dealt with our needing to work on our communication. I mean, honestly. It was easy for me to fall for her again when she opened up to me. I was over joyed that she was showing me that she loved me. i havent felt that way in a long long time. Those few days were what i was waiting for for months. i finally felt like she truly did love me again. And i acted stupid and screwed it up. at least thats how it feels. Now im back to where i was the 15th, but this time i have no contact and i still ache more and more when i see signs that she has (easily) moved on with her life without me and im still stuck feeling like how i thought she did two weeks prior but without any aid from her to get over myself.

Now Im glad for my friends that are coming out of the woodwork and letting me know that they are here for me. and are trying to help me move on with my life, but i still.... no matter what i do, i cant kill the feelings i have for her or at least shut them up for a bit so that i can try to focus on my work. 

That was another thing that it really really dislike about what happened. Here I was trying to refocus my life  so that i could get a full time job and move in my life by shutting her out of my head and focusing on the important things going on, and rather than giving a clean break like it seems shes actually trying to do now, she keeps talking to me and texting me and chatting with me. I mean i loved that she gave her attention to me again, but it threw me back off the work horse.  Now im finding it even more difficult to try to focus on working to get a full time job than i ever have.  I thought cutting all ties with her would help me out and not hurt me. Those two weeks almost completely dissolved my resolve. 

Wait... we were in contact with each other a fair ammout over those weeks... why did she deny it. well i guess thats just one more question ill never have answered. I wonder if she found her charm yet. to be honest, i put it back in there with the hope that she would eventually just give it back to me once more to show that there still was a chance that we would work out. But rather i guess things werent ment to go that way. What was my lenten journey seems to be going further and further down the wrong path. I still have a lot that id like to do with her and lots that id just like to do with someone period. I loved going out and doing things as a couple or even just hanging out with each other. I just loved sharing my life with her. and miss the feeling that i can do that at all. I dont feel anywhere near close enough to anyone else right now that i have the desire to try and share my life with them.

I know that there is a plan  for me and that i need to trust that htere is one and that it will fall into play. the evening of the 15th i came to terms with the fact that nancy's role in my life was to teach me about love and to show me that i could love that much, but was not to be the one that i would spend the rest of my life with. So  i put it into God's hand for the night and just tried to work on my other aspects so that i could still have my life. I figured that if it was meant to be, then it will work out, and if it wasnt, it wont. After the next night, i disregarded that train of thought completely. I thought that her talking to me again was God's way of saying that things were meant to work out between us. i still tried to leave it in his hands for the next little bit, but after a little bit longer with her, i fell in love with her again. This break off fells like it hurts 3 times as much as it did the first time. And to make matters worse, i dont have the same distractions that i did the first time. i dont have S&L to focus on because there are no events to work on due to it being spring break. I dont know what my current status is on my position as the supervisor so im not in any mood or desire.... and there went my choochooo train of thought. Sorry.... i was just thinking that i needed to talk with one omf my old best friends about this, and now  im wondering if my adderal is just making things worse for me right now, because it seems that, although i am able to focus on certain tasks, i also seem to think more about this the higher my dosage is. On the max lvl, which is what i usually need to focus on work, my mind seems to spin a whole lot more about things like this. This actually kinda sucks.  And this has nothing to do with any of this, but the fact that im in a closed building  with no access to the inside and really need to pee right now is not helping me focus on anything.i think i might just post this and then just continue it on in the next post.

"event","why is it so hard to believe that people have dreams and goals when they get discouraged.  Why cant be supported in my goals and dreams. And why cant people understand that i have more than 1. To be honest, a new one has been developing over time since i have been mostly siting around and thinking in my own head. I have been told that i need to decide  what it is that i want to do again. And, although i have made quite a few decisions, i still have some obstacles in my way. I have been sitting down and thinking for a while on what it is about pool that makes me want to go pro at it and more over become either the best or at least on e of the best. I like the challenge that is present. I love playing against the ""big fish.""  I actually used to be good enough to be able to stand up against them. But no one believed in me. No one supported my dream or even supported me in trying to achieve it make it one of my goals in my over all plan. And whats worse, no one wanted to believe that it is even related in any way to my ultimate career.  So they told me to exclude it from the piece of paper that defines who i am to an employer and some chose to believe that i didnt have any goals, and more over that i didnt know anything. 

But i did have goal. And i still do. If anything, this time i spent sitting here thinking has been a blessing in disguise, because it help me figure out exactly what is is i needed to know. I figured out how pool is relative to my mechanical engineering degree and why i enjoyed it so much, and why i feel as though it defines who i am just as much as that piece of paper that says i graduated from usf.

All it took was going to a AKPsi event to help me pull it all together and try to figure out what it is that i want to get into [or at least mostly figure it out]. 

All of my being and who i am as a person can at least be summed up in one phrase:
I don't create, I innovate."" I'm an innovator through and through. As soon as the word innovation was clearly defined for me everything that i was trying to say started to make sense, moreover it started connecting. Im not creative. I'm innovative. I have since forgotten the definition that i was given on the day that i went to this ""resume building"" event that never discussed resumes, but i got the gist, of it by looking it up again. According to dictionary.com the term innovate means ""to introduce something new; make changes in anything established."" Basically that is what was covered on that day that is giving me the edge. 

Finally the gift that God gave to me made sense when i learned the definition of innovation. My sense of humor is based on my being innovative. my pool playing style and the whole reason why i love the game so much was defined. i loved it so much because i found what was apparently a new unique way to play the game. I changed the variables that were held constant in the game, and found a whole new deeper meaning to it. 

Thinking back on my resume, stating that i played pool was telling people that i was innovative, much in the same way that i was trying to define everything else. 

When i went to the career counselor he told me tried helping me figure out what it is that i wanted to do in the field of mechanical engineering that related to my job at sound and light because i  fell in love with the job i was doing, but i dont think he fully understood why i loved that job. 

I fell in love with my sound and light job for the very same reason that i  fell in love with pool.  Of course, all the events i did were basically the same thing paper, but in reality, how i handled each event was much different. I found a new and, in my opinion, better way to do each event every time i worked it. When i was repairing the equipment, i found unique ways to do it. I innovated new methods to make a lot of the equipment in the shop continue to work.

Now the hard part is still ahead of me because all that word did was tell me the type of job i'm looking for. Finding a job that does that is only one aspect of my goals. Some of  the other ones deal with the oath that i made at my induction ceremony and later that i made again to myself to use this ginormous gift to help others. 

Thats where i am right now, but i am not going to give up on my other goals. 

Wait... hold on.....

I'm not sure i actually said what my goals are yet. So let me get them out now (in no particular order):

- I will become one of the best pool players
- I will start a family of my own and carry on my family name
- I will find a job that allows me to use my talents to better the world and make enough of a living doing it that the other two goals can be achieved

Im not actually sure what the fourth goal is just yet, but i know i will find one ultimately. And i will not let anything get in my way. I will find a way to make those 3 goals work even if i have to separate myself from those whom i love that might get in the way of these goals.

I want the support of those whom i love, but i'm not going to be held back from using my talents to help others."

"event","its really intersting how much my life is really influenced by certain friends and family members.  Now i consider myself to be a rather silly individual (which is usually more evident either at night or when im not taking my medication), yet i still find myself wanting to be even sillier around the majority of my closer friends.  With some of them all i need to do is meerly look at a random photo of them and it makes me just crack up and start acting rather goofy.  

the only rather odd thing is that as my life progresses, im finding that i am, unfortunately, slowly losing my usual silly and extroverted nature . its almost to the point now where i only find myself not acting serious when im around them.  now, its not completely to that point yet because every so often i find myself getting really really bored or tired and all of a sudden saying WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! in a high pitched voice for no reason what soever and the starting to act truly silly in many other ways.  Buts its almost as if my mind has to get fed up and say ok, thats enough to hell with it im just going to start acting abmormal  for this to occur.  And quite frankly, that just sucks because that makes it a whole lot hardder for what i think of as being the real me to come out and goof around.  i guess  this too makes me a little co-dependant.

Ok, so I am like almost done w/ getting my undergrad in ME and i finally fully understand what i was trying to get across to my advisors 4 years ago when i tried to explain the type of job that i wanted to do.  Needless to say that my description was lacking quoite a bit of details for someone to actualy understand what the hell i was trying to say.

I believe that my exact words was that i wanted to do somethnig where i was working w/ my hands and basically i didnt want to be stuck just doing the theory crap and not making anything.  


Well, up until recently, that theory crap was the best way i could describe it to people.

I now understand that what i what i want to get involed in is the creation of a product (like being a machinist for example).  Though i couldnt put it into great words, what i was really trying to say was that i understand that to create something one must go through a design process first (which is what it seems that engineers do a lot of- well that and testing)...... more later"

"event","Ok, I know that Kurt must have felt similar to me, even though he didnt really admit it.

Lemme start from the begining here.  On the day that my dad died, there was this one point in time where we were trying to move him from the couch to the hospital bed right next to the couch (which was a major feat in it of it self since he was basically dead weight- no pun intended).  Anyways, when we got him half way there (which doesnt mean much cause it was like 2 feet away from the couch) he started screaming out in pain and telling us to wait a minute and such and so forth.   Now that really got to me.  Now before any comments get made saying that it wasnt my fault, i know i wasnt the cause of any of his pain and that he was very frustrated with the fact that he couldnt do  anything about his pain and his dying, but it still felt like i had something to do w/ it.  My head knows that i wasnt responsible at all for it, but some part of me still fealt it when dad screamed out.  

So i just talked to kurt about this yesterday, and i asked him how he felt about it.  Well, he kinda gave me the good middle child answer of how he knew that no matter what he could do dada was going to be in pain and there was going to be a little bit of a struggle w/ moving him.  Which i took as basically saying that he wasnt really affected by it (or at least not in the same way that i was affected by it).  

Maybe its just because i'm the littlest child and i just couldnt completely understand that at the time (though i thought i did) and its just the difference in the thinking pattern in the middle child compared to the youngest. 

But i was affected by it because im the type of person who like to help people out and never, NEVER cause anyone to really suffer and i could swear that Kurt is the same way.  So why it is that he didnt seem to be affected in the same way as me illudes me right now.  Im completely befuddled.  Was he just acting like the big brother in trying to console and there by giving me this notion that he wasnt affected by it at all? OR what ? 

Ok, i know that no one ever thinks like me ever, but i thought that at least kurt would have felt the same as me about that and that we could have shared that moment w/ each other.  And now im done ranting about the situation.  I guess i'm alone in this thought and ill just have to work it out on my own time."

Sorry jess, but im affraid that the original entry that i will be adapting from the other account is persoinalized a bit and isnt accesable to you (or at least i think it wont be asuming i do it right)... sorry

So anyways, I had a dream last night (i know, oh big whoop right?). But this was different.  And ill explain how to the best of my ability. NOw i dont know about the rest of the world, but when i usually dream, i have no concept at oll of my surroundings. the dream is my reality while im in it. plain and simple. and i, well i wont say never but, almost never really realize that im even in a dream. The only acception is when i really need to exit the dream then i can make myself realize that im actually in a drream and get out of it. Last night was different however.  

Ok, yesterday i took my adderal, but at a lower dosage.  THat probably was my first mistake seeing as how it always seems to make me wide awake and i sometimes have a hard time sleeping.  But thats really a whole other can of worms.  For the purpose of this entry, ill just say that i couldn't for the life of me get myself to fall asleep (which i have kinda gotten used to i guess) until like after 2.  Thats the as usual king friday part.  The part that really freaked me out, besides some of the content of what the dream entailed, (which is a little confusing now)was the state i was in during this dream.  The best way i can describe it is that i was in both realities at the same time.  It was like i was completely involved in the reality of the dream and thought that it wasa real live situation, but at the same time was aware that it was a dream, and was concious at the same time.  Now when i say this i dont mean i was day dreaming.  I was asleep, but i also wasnt at the same time. I was completely aware of the time that was passing by in what i know to be reality while im ""awake"".  

This has been by far  the weirdest experiances i have ever been through."

I'm concerned about Rebecca, but thats understandable.  She going into surgery to remove her cyst and ovary. Thats only normal.  And I know that at one point in time I concidered trying for her (before i found out how much that may be a mistake) which explains why I am acting this way around her now.  She moved up into my good/best friends plus category.  Hopefully she'll make a full recovery and will be great shortly after the little opperation that she'll have.

Jen (aka Jenny) is still throwing me through loops. And its all because I cant kill these stupid feelings that I was left w/ at the end of the relationship. Now supposedly she is in another relationship that I have no clue about, and I can't get in touch w/ her again to find out about this.  I'm begining to think that I need to set up a calling schedule w/ her.  I feel like I'm being avoided, and because of these stupid feelings, its killing me (not literally, but you know what I mean).

I want to get into a relationship again, but its seems that everyone is either taken or in the process of being taken (you know, the process that usually cant be stopped- except in the one case that involved me).  Its discuraging. And I want to know where the heck they're finding these people, and where I can go to find someone too.  Once agian I'm feeling out of the loop, but this time its not on info about my family or info on friends, but rather out of the loop on this whole relationship front.  It seems like everyone has someone that they're getting w/ but me.  And I just got messed up enough recently to realize this as being a problem.  I mean it always hurt hearing about a party that I was never sure I was invited to (and usually wasnt). But this is starting to feel like a blow to pretty much every part of me.

  ****This is why I have no one knowing about this account.  I hate this feeling, and dont wasnt anyone to confuse what the meaning is behind it.  I also dont want anyone throwing any counter points at me and making me feel like an even bigger idiot for posting my dee innermost feelings in the first place.  Im letting a leak seap through this barrier, and I 'd rather not let anyone in on it yet.  I'm not comfortable enough  w/ anyone to share this w/ them. I might be later, but not right now.

Being out of the emotional attachment loop sucks!

So theres Krystle out there, but its begining to seem like she and I will never see eachother again.  That and the fact that I'm not sure that she feels any particular way about me outside of the long lost friend category seems to kill the my enthusiasm about it.  

Paula sent me an email that said how she was missing me, but once again, shes a good friend, she much older than me, and she's engaged.

Lindsay I guess could be a possibility, but (no offense if you actually some how find this and read it) she seems to always be taken, seems not to interested, and I'm not so sure she's my type at all, but then who knows.  I mean after all, I havent really gotten to know her all that well.\

Then there's Lindsey G.  I swear, I know her relationship will end eventually, but it seems like its going to go on forever.  Lindsey has been and will always be my plan A.  I want to learn more about deep feelings so that I can fully understand what it is I feel for her. But alas, she may never know about this if she never breaks it off w/ Andy.   I hate being patient.

Ellen B- Im many days late and numerous dollars short

I am totally confused about where I stand on anything, and am feeling down about myself (though you could never tell from the way I act around the world).  I need to find a woman, but have no clue where this get matched quick scheme is."

"event","I love the way I am(sarcasm)... I always feel like I'm a bother if I'm not doing anything while at someone's place.  I feel like I'm just in the way an awful lot.  For example, I went over to Rebecca's place tonight. The point was to try and help out w/ her computer, but as it got to be about 6 or 6:30, I felt like I was more in her way and being a bother or a burden than a help. Finally, at about 7 she gave me an out by sayingthat she had stuff to do .  Now I'm not really sure whether or not I actually was keeping good company or not, but after a while, I didnt feel like it.  I guess the problem is that I can't always tell how long I'm welcome for and I never know when I should leave.  I guess its probably partially do to the fact that I dont feel like I'm that important (part of my low self esteem problem you know)."

"event","I seriously need to get a woman badly!  I mean its nice borrowing Rebecca every so often and using her to get some of my emotions out on, but I seriously need to find someone. Im starting to get into a rut and feelig down again.   And the thing is si that I think that I'm like stuck in my own routine that I cant get out and find somewone. I starting to feel more and more like a loser every day 'cause I cant find anyone, while everyone around me seems to have no problem finding someone.  I'm sure that I'll eventually gewt over myself and when I least expect it, BAM! I'll get hit over the head again.   I just hope that i find someone soon, because im startig to feel like im jenny's play thing.  Maybe a ride on Sheekra will help me feel better.  But the only thing is that I'm starting to feel like the only female friend I have left thats in the area is Rebecca.  I guess I just need to find Krystle......"

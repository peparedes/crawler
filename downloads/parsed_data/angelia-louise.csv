"event","so basically, this is supposed to be a short entry about my need to vent. starting in 3...2...1. COMMENCE!


i fucking hate 'step dads'. they aren't any good at all. and if there is one that's good, send him over here! because this piece of sodding shit in my life is not making things better. my mom's just setting herself up for relationship failure again. and i feel horrible about saying that and such, but she is. this person is an asshole. he has NO patience whatsoever, no compassion, no dreams, nothing! and most of the time i think he doesn't have a fucking brian either. he is probably the biggest prat i've EVER met in my life. right up there with my real dad, assholes. he's always yelling at me when no one else is around, ALL THE TIME. its completely annoying. he's always yelling at Peter too, but he never says a word to Alex or Paul. come to think of it, he never says anything to any of my family. now, thats what i call disrespectful. he never lets you get a word in edgewise when he's talking. and if you even start to interrupt him, he starts stuttering all over again. but when he's yelling, he never stutters, he fucking pisses me off. i can't stand him. 

this weekend my mom's going on a business trip and I'm completely not comfortable with staying with him. even though, i should feel completely comfortable when I'm with someone my mom trusts, let alone married. but i don't. i feel awkward, it's just weird. and when I'm napping or something and I'm like ""oh can you wake me up for dinner?"" and he's like ""sure"". and i always find myself waking up in the middle of the night, or way passed dinner time and he never woke me up. now, i know that I'm old enough to wake myself up. but I'm working on that so bear with me. and i'll go downstairs and be like ""what's for dinner?"" and he'll be like ""oh i already ate. go get a sandwich."" and I'm like wow good looking out for me asshole. URGH I HATE HIM.

he is CONSTANTLY accusing me of stuff i didn't do or stuff that i don't think at all. like just before, i was like 
i wanna get done painting so i can go to ikea with mom tomorrow before her business trip."" and he's like ""your not going anywhere blah blah blah. all you want to do is spend money blah blah blah."" and he's doing all this and yelling at the same time. and I'm like WOW WHAT THE FUCK? and i said ""um no i don't always want to spend money. and i thought that i could do that with mom before she leaves."" and then he flips again. it's honestly getting old.

I'm seriously convinced that i'll die this weekend. this man DOES NOT know how to take care of a person, let alone a teenager or child if you will. so I'm going to be sitting up in my room (because god forbid my supposed friends were to call me) and pigging out on junk food or stuff i got from the kitchen and i'll be watching movies, and talking to myself. same old shit. but mostly, i think i'll miss my mom. because she's basically the only person i talk to in my house. and thats sad. extremely.

over all, I'm pissed. maybe later i'll write about what been going on in my life. maybe not, i don't know. but I'm still severely pissed off, so i'll stop ranting now.


lividly yours,

"event","another panic attack, another extremely depressive ten minutes of my life. I've been awake since 5 p.m yesterday. and I haven't slept a wink. and I've tried, believe you me. At this very moment in time I'm feeling more than depressed. if thats even possible. I feel like there is no hope for me, like I'll never rid this horrible monster inside of me. I constantly feel angry, over emotional, depressed. I obviously don't always feel this way, people have their moments (I know that much). but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by something. except in this case, my something is actually nothing. did you get all that?

I know I can't explain it very well, and I would ask that you wouldn't ask me to. To explain something that's causing you so much pain and hurt is actually more difficult than everyone and their mother thinks. i mean let's be real here people, no one (and I mean NO ONE) will know exactly how you feel. ever. because they're not you, obviously. people will always say, I understand completely what your going through, meanwhile, they really don't. they might think they do, but in reality, they don't. and then you have people some who will never fully comprehend other peoples emotions. the ones who tell you ""it's not hard, just tell me how you feel."" yeah well listen buddy, it IS hard in fact. I, myself, find it extremely difficult to get my feeling completely out and explain EXACTLY what I'm going through. but I honestly can't go that, I've tried. really, I have. but whatever I say, it comes out weird. and its not like its intentional, because obviously its not. when people do that to me, telling me to explain how I feel, explain what I'm going through. sorry ladies and gents, can't really do that.

I feel as though there is a monster (or a very small creature. whichever you prefer) is growing on me and feasting on my depression. making itself bigger and bigger until finally it explodes and there will be nothing left of me. now, I'm still not looking into suicide, so calm down. but that's kinda how I feel. I feel unbearably lonely and lost. like no one wants to, or is even bothering to help me. nothing. let's think of this analogy (if that's the right word) shall we: your a cup. your filled with water, until suddenly someone drinks almost all your contents and you have almost nothing left. no purpose of being that cup of water anymore. nothing to live for. your empty now, the mysterious thing has completely drained what is left of your dignity and soul. nothings left, nothing at all. you're feeling lonely, lost and naked. nothing matters, no one cares. no one's bothering to re-fill you and give you a purpose once more, your just an empty cup now.

and that my livejournal friends, is what I'm feeling. like a sodding cup. empty, alone and bear. basically nothing to live for, no purpose. but deep, deep down I know there's something I need to do. something worth living for, I just haven't found that something yet. and I'm starting to think I never will.

I know that 'kids' my age shouldn't have emotions and feeling like I do, but the fact is that I do. I'm only Sixteen for god's sake. and for the majority of my time I'm feeling utterly depressed and lost. I should be living life! taking chances, finding love, exploring and occasionally experimenting new things. but I'm not. I'm in my room at almost 8 a.m, typing on livejournal because my therapist canceled on me today. joy.

maybe a poem will help you understand, if the analogy didn't do it for you:

depressive tears stream down the face of an innocent child.
depressive tears escape the swollen eyes of hope.
depressive tears show more than anyone will never see.
be strong, don't show it.
yet, it cannot be helped.
every night, everyday they start again.
those depressive tears.
depressive tears peek into the soul of a broken teenager.
depressive tears show no hope for a better tomorrow.
depressive tears burn their way down the cheeks of the broken.
it hurts, just make then stop.
stop forever, so i'll never have to feel them again.
those depressive tears.

in a nutshell, that's what happened to me almost two hours ago. that's how I felt, well, not all of it. I'm feeling lost now more than ever. I'm trying to reach out but I can't seem to grasp anything. I'm trying, please believe me. I really am.


insanely yours,

"event","warning: do to content portrayed in this entry, it might not be suitable for all ages. viewer discretion is advised.




fuck.this.bullshit. once again, life leaves me confused and totally lost. i mean honestly, i don't wanna have to live my life being scared of basically everything in this fucking world. people are constantly scared of things like ""love"". my in-take on this: what's the point. not the love part, because everyone (and i mean everyone) deserves love. no matter what. but what i'm trying to say is that, i don't want to have to live my life being scared of getting hurt. it shouldn't be like that. sadly though, it is. most people (and teenagers), are infatuated with trying to find ""the one"". listen people! you have your whole life ahead of you. just wait it out, your time will come eventually. hopefully.

some of us aren't really that lucky to find to person they love and that is ""the one"". and some of us (namingly me, i think) don't ever think that they ever will find that person. i'm not trying to be all ""love sucks, fuck life, love doesn't exist"" because i know it does. i just know. if it doesn't really exist then everyone can burn all my Harry Potter related stuff. (which won't happen because love DOES exist. take that world)

i just want to believe that two people can stay together forever (i heard that from Juno) and it's true. as of right now, i have no reason whatsoever to believe that two people are perfect for each other. unless your talking fictional characters (then i got that covered). but other than that, no one's ever given me a reason to believe in love (even though i do, partially), or ""true love"" or anything of that other Disney/Hallmark shit. honestly though, a part of me wishes (and hopes) that someone will find me, the real me, and sweep me off my feet. they'll be able to take me away from this horrid land i call Depression and i'll finally be content and happy. oh i wish.

since i'm being completely honest here, i can't remember a time where i've actually been happy ya know? i can't remember being carefree, not even when i was a kid. i guess i was more carefree than i am now, obviously.  but i was always worried about something, always something. oddly enough, when i was a kid i used to always look in the mirror and try to figure out if i was actually real or not. yeah, it sounds weird. but its true. i used to (and sometimes still do) think that this is all ""a game"" or this isn't real and i'm going to wake up from this and it'll all be a dream and i'll live another life. so far, i haven't woken up yet.

what does ""being in love"" really mean? my in-take, you can love and hate the person at the same time, you can never stay mad, extremely mad at them for long periods of time. it's like a magnetic energy is pulling you towards them, you'll never stay away for too long. you day can be the most fucked-up day of the year, and when you see them, it gets to be the best day of your life (oh god, that was sappy). you light up like a christmas tree (or a menorah for my jewish friends out there) when you see them. you can't seem to break that little hope inside of you that maybe, just maybe, you'll last forever.

as far as i'm concerned, i've never fallen in love. i've liked people a lot, like exceptionally a lot. but not love, i think. i've been infatuated, yeah i'm not gonna lie. but never love. i've been physically (and emotionally) attracted. but never love. but i wish, really i do, that one day i'll be in love. just for a day. just to feel what it's like to have someone to care about you, someone to constantly pester you and make sure your okay (when you're really not), someone who loves you. have i found that yet? no, and at times, i don't think i will.

this entry is basically half depressive, and half hopeful. i'm trying to have a brighter outlook on life, but it's hard you know? when a good chunk of your friends have the basic epitome of the ""perfect life"" and your stuck wondering when your time will come. i always tell my friend (who has the same ""when will i find that person"" situation) that her time will come, and without a doubt i'm sure of it. but sometimes i wonder. i really do.

good people don't always get what they want, what they deserve. they people that really don't deserve anything, don't work for anything, get what they want. ""good always triumphs over evil""; yeah likely story. that really doesn't always happen as you can see. how is it that good people, who haven't done anything to anybody, get cancer or randomly die or just don't get what they deserve? that's complete and utter BULLSHIT. ridiculous if you ask me. how is it that people who are the meanest little shits in the world get almost exactly what they want? two words readers, NOT FAIR. how in the hell can people who have done nothing but be amazing people get nothing? everything gets fucked up for them. it's horrible.

if there's one wish that i could have it would be: that the people who's lives haven't been the best (and they suffered tremendously) should finally get what they deserve. they should get the so-called ""perfect life"". they should get all the material items they want, they should get everything their little heart desires. but it's only a wish, it can't really happen.

you know, i wish for so many things. world peace (yeah right, that's likely), true love (doubt it), a clean room (eh, i'm too lazy) and a bunch of other stuff i could rattle off randomly. but i've realized that until i see all of this with my own eyes, then i won't truly believe it. on a believer-scale of one to ten, i'm about a six. i really wish i was a twenty though.

as of late, i've been feeling a half optimistic and half pessimistic. but can you blame me? i haven't been given a reason to be fully optimistic. i wish i had one though, because then i wouldn't have to sit here at two in the morning writing down my most inner thoughts. truth be told, i've also been feeling hopeful. like i feel like something better is going to start happening. on the downside, i've been getting very angry too. for one person to feel like this if seemingly impossible. at least i'm glad i don't have ""the emotional range of a teaspoon"" (harry potter reference, good stuff). at least i'm trying to live. key word: trying.

"event","<br /><font size=""1"">to honestly say that i'm utterly confused and befudled with life is an understatment. i'm literally losing myself. i constantly feel dazed and confused (which is kind of funny because i think that's a movie, anyways). confusion and bewilderment is a strange thing to feel, really it is. to know that your not really sure of anything is a scarey thought. or at least, i think its rather scary. when people look up to you and really do think you know what your talking about all the timeand that your information will always be right, is something exceptionally big to live up to. If someone were to say, ""Well, she knows everything; she's hardly ever wrong"", could you deal with that pressure of making sure your right all the time? and to try your hardest to never, ever to be wrong. and if your wrong once and you make a mistake; people won't ever forget it and let you live it down. they'll constantly bring it up in fights, arguments or casual (or trying to be casual) conversations. i personally think that it's a very pressured position that you're put in. people make mistakes; some more than others. but that's how we, human beings, learn. we make mistakes, learn, live, make more mistakes and repeat. done deal. <br /><br />although i have to say, that there's one thing that leaves me completely flabbergasted. let's say that one of your friends talks about you behind your back; like something so horrible that she/he wasn't supposed to tell anyone else. you find out; you confront them. they said yeah, i made a mistake blah blah blah. you end up forgiving them. now say, you say something minor about that friend; which wasn't personal to them or anything. they find out, ergo they flip their bird on you. and you said you made a mistake. but unfortunately, that friend doesn't forgive you. ever. and it hurts to have trusted someone and tell them something so personal and close to your heart and actually think that they can keep your secret. but evidently, they can't. and they made a mistake and you forgave them. but god forbid you make a mistake and a little one at that, and they never completely forgive you. horrible, absolutely horrible. <br /><br />obviously i'm still venting over everything thats happened to me in my life. i've gone through alot. and i'm not looking for sympathy or anything like that. but i just need to lean on someone, in a sense. i can take care of myself, i always will and i always have. i'm an independent person and i intend to stay that way until the day i die. but once in a while, even for a little bit, i need someone to lean on. not someone to tell me everything's going to be okay; because in truth it will never actually be okay. everyone has their own problems, but somehow, i'm not really entitled to have problems. ridiculous. <br /><br />i try to make the best of these problems that i have. attempting to make jokes out of depression and horrible thoughts isn't easy. you have to understand though, my 'horrble thoughts' don't consist of suicide or self hurt or anything like that. it's more like over-analyzing thoughts (if that makes sense). thoughts of what if i don't get out of this depression thats pulling me in by the hour. i'm trying so hard to over-come this. but sometimes it's so hard and when no one is willing to help you, it's harder than usual. and that just sucks. <br /><br />consumed by thoughts and images you don't want to see is overwhelming. thinking that if you don't get better, something bad might happen. hoping that you'll be swallowed by something that's been nagging at you for forever. <br /><br />as always, i'm over-come by these emotions and thoughts. still waiting and waiting for someone to break down this barrier. to help me and show me the real way. to let me lean on them and give me comfort. i want- no, i need, someone to listen. even though i cant verbal express myself as well i can express myself through my writing, just sit there and listen. my views might be a tad bit twisted by manipulation and other peoples points of view, but i try to set my mind free of that. just help, anyone, please help.<br /><br /><br />insanely yours,<br />angelia simeti</font>"

"event","<p><br /><font size=""1"">realization. dictionary.com's definition: comming to understand something clearly and&nbsp;</font><font size=""1"">distinctly. in my opinion, this is true. and yet realization can mean so much more than that. it could mean to finally grasping your situation for what it really is; and not just taking what you can get. because let's face it people, most human beings (most not all) take whatever they can get. hardly anyone bothers to reach for they sky and make their dreams come true. ""it's not possible"" some say. or ""this is life; there's nothing i can do about it."" or my all time favorite, ""i WANTED to be this or that; but my obigations lied somewhere else."". now, i totally understand if theres a situation or something. but after that, after everything esle is done and over with, why can't you follow your dream? realisticly, everything's possible. for the kids who don't do good and school but try their hardest, they think they won't be anything. people such as family members or friends, encourage their idea of not being anything. and yet, they try so hard to make everyone proud. for those kids who to mediocrely in school, trys but doesn't always succed, people tell them ""you can do it; apply yourself better."". what if those kids can't because they really don't know how? nobody bothers to even help them; teacher's, yeah i hardly think so. there are very few teacher's in our society that actually try to help those kind of kids. but maybe, just maybe, those teachers that don't help actually don't know how to 'apply' themselves as they claim. all i'm saying is that in this day and age, there is so much pressure to be perfect or the best at everything. sometimes its too much pressure.</font></p><p><font size=""1"">ok, so that rant was totally unexspected. no lie. i mean i started going with the whole ""realization"" concept; but then it just multiplied into something bigger. obviously, ranting is what i do best. i love it. live for it. it basically describes me. in a sense. anyways, for an update on my life: i'm confused, bored and depressed. Mrs Charity told my mom i needed to see a therapist. and honestly, i wholeheartedly agree. someone, besides her, needs to realize that ti keep falling and noone's giving an effort to help me. not one bit. but at least she's pushing me into the right direction. and thats what i asked for. thank the good lord for Mrs Charity.<br /><br />i'm cutting this entry short. yeah, there's tons i wanna say in such a short time. but, my wrists hurt horribly. i think i have carpul-tunnel syndrome. whatever. jsut another thing to add to my ""illness'"". i'm also just in a blah mood. whatever.<br /><br />still going in a endless circle of confusion. lost by these inner-thoughts. help me. that's all i ask. it can't be that difficult can it? i feel like a helpless child; lost in wal-mart or something. people see me crying. they stare. but don't make an effort to help. maybe it's meant to be this way. maybe i'm supposed to fall in obvion. maybe, just maybe, this is all supposed to mean something.<br /><br />insanely yours,<br />angelia simeti.</font></p>"

(which i probably won't). every mid-term i've taken in high school i've failed. i think it's because of all the words on the tests. they're all like regents questions. i'm a firm beliver that i have a reading disablity. no joke. but noone is doing anything about it. i've told my mom and brian repeatedly that i need to get tested. i've brought it up with my guidance consoler. mrs. draycott. honestly, she really doesn't help much. i think i'll bring it up with mrs. charity. i'll go in early or something and see if she's there. since she did say she was going to be in her office all mid-term week or something of that nature.<br /><br />i really think i am a weird person. honestly, i'm kinda like two different people. i always contridic myself. it's like a daily routine. i bet you anything that in theses journal entries i'll contridic myself more then a billion times. i guess it like one side of me is saying one thing and the other side is something something completely or relatively different. it's very very annoying. really it is. i think it's llike i have mutipule personality disorder. i've asked mrs. charity and she says that i don't have it. at times, i totally disagree. but i don't ""lost time"" like people with MPD. idon't know. but do i ever really know? nope i guess not.<br /><br />i've been thinking. nothing new there. well, let's just say brian did work. like a real job. then we would have to be trying to rake up money just to get the bills paid. and no, i'm not saying it's all his fault and putting all the blame on him. because that's morally wrong. but honestly, he needs to own up to his title of step-father that he holds 'so dearly' to his heart. my mom suggests that he takes pride in being my stepd-dad. quite honestly, i think different. sure, he's a really great guy. he picks me up and drops me off where ever. but i only think it's because he feels he has to. he's really nice. but he does over-react to te little things. and that just annoys me. now, i know for a fact, that i tend to over-react at times too. but he over-reacts at things like: my sweet sixteen, banana holders, and simplest household tasks. i for one, will not pretend that i absolutly love doing household tings. because i don't. i hate cleaning. tidying up. and all that. it annoys me. personally, i think he needs anger-managment. as well as myself. because i need to get out this pented-up anger.<br /><br />so far, live journal has been saving my life. not in the respect that i would actually have the guts to&nbsp;commit suicide. because i wouldn't.&nbsp; i know myself&nbsp;well&nbsp;enough to say that.&nbsp;this is the only way i know how to let go of this anger and emotion. because it's deffinetly not just anger. it's sadness. excitment. lonliness. happiness. grieveing. all these things i feel everyday. it's hard to descirbe all these in speaking terms. if that makes sense. i like writing it out more. hence the obvious use of livejournal.<br /><br />noone still hasn't bothered breaking down this barrier. it's getting wider and wider as noone helps me as i fall into obivion. taken over by my most inner thoughts. i'm calling out for help. some listen. even for just 10 mintues. i've been calling out for help. but my voice is getting tired. so help me, please.<br /><br /><br />insanely yours,<br />angelia simeti.</font></p>"

could they&nbsp;actually say, ""angelia, i know exactly what your going through. i see anti- [insert name here] all the time."". no, i bet they couldn't. or at least the people i know couldn't acutally relate on that level.<br /><br />i've&nbsp;come to realize that i'm not really normal. and in a sense&nbsp;i'm fine with that. but in another snese, it bothers me. don't get me wrong, i love being different. i try&nbsp;and strive to be&nbsp;different. but&nbsp;'social norms' are so demanding and i wish&nbsp;i could put a stop to it. i&nbsp;constantly feel like&nbsp;an outsider. like i dont&nbsp;(and never will) actually fit it. like i said, i kinda don't want to.&nbsp;but then&nbsp;again i kinda do. i at least want to be accepted for who i <em>really</em> am. and it's not like i put on a show for everyone. i am myself. but restrained. i never get to actually be the angelia i know i am. unless&nbsp;i'm completely alone. then the real me shows.&nbsp;and i&nbsp;really&nbsp;do love the real me.<br /><br />i guess you could say that i don't let my true personality show is because&nbsp;i'm scared. of rejection. critizism.&nbsp;not really being&nbsp;accepted for who i am&nbsp;by my friends and peers. i want to be accepted. but i really don't think thats possible. i don't&nbsp;want to hide the fact&nbsp;that i read fanfic (deff not a soical norm). i don't want&nbsp;to hide that fact that i constantly read articles on&nbsp;harry potter or just&nbsp;stuff going on in the world. i don't want to hide the fact that i actually (quite possibly) can dance, but i don't want to look like some stupid white girl who&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;know what shes doing. i really want to show my true colors. but with this town, more like this world, i really can't. it's okay to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a <em>little</em> different. but if you go to far, you'll probably lose your friends. the ones who say ""i'll be by your side no matter what."". honestly, i'm not sure if thats entirely true. if i told all my friends that i write fanfic (which is actually creative writing and very good for anger and to cure major boredom) then i bet you maybe most of then would think i'm weird by capacity. if if the ones who say they don't care stick with you, eventually, they think it's too much. people will end up asking them questions if they are friends with that <em>weird girl</em> and in the end, they just might say no, i <em>used</em> to be friends with her. but now, she's just too weird. now, do I personally think any of my friends would do this, i honestly don't know. i really don't know.<br /><br />i've decided that i'm going to write a book. title: Insanely Yours,. about: well, me actually. but noone has to know that. i'll change the name and everything. but i'll say based on a true story. people close to me will obviously know it's me. but i doubt we will ever actually talk in depth about it. it's mostly formated to look like the journal entries i type here. to add it up, it's about a girl who doesn't really know where she stands in society. she's born to be different, but she doesn't know how to express it. she's learning, slowly but surely, how to be her true self. it's like a comming of age story. probably angsty, general humor, maybe some crude humor and in depth detail of what's going on in her mind. which is most deffinetly a complicated place. why: to keep myself from actually going insane. no joke. i think if i can't express my feelings through talking, then why not through literature. i mean, Edgar Allen Poe, was most deffinetly emo/angst to the max. i wonder if he killed himself. i'll end up looking it up online. plus, i love writing. creative writing. in all my creative writing essays i've gotten a 95 or higher. which is REALLY good for me. i think my true calling might be an author or t.v host. like Oprah. but white. and not as rich. then i'll be the white Oprah. sounds fun.<br /><br />i need to get out. of new york more specifically. i was sitting on the couch in my living room the night of my anxiety attack (mental meltdown) and i was going to get up and go get something to eat. but, something caught my eye. it was a brightly colored pamphlet. that said ""learn by doing"" and i'm what in the high holey hell is this? since i have natural curiousity, i opened it. it was a summe rprogram at Yale University. like a summer camp, but preparing you for college. if your a residental student (which i would be because there ain't no way in hell that i'm getting dropped off at Yale every morning. no one would do that for me.) then you sleep at the Old Campus (which you also do everything else there too). it's great. it's like an acdemic experience of a lifetime.&nbsp;you pick two morning classes and two afternoon activities. they literally have everything there. like i said, amazing. it's like a real college too. international stundents and U.S students from aroudn the globe and country go. many different backgrounds. it's like a new start for everyone. to meet new people. cuturally diffuse yourself. there are two sessions. each are <u>$</u>4315.&nbsp;i think. that covers room and board, supplies for your classes &amp;&nbsp;food (3 meals a day). they give you laundry manchines, refridgerators (in your living spaces), a bed and room to sleep in, showers etc. it's really like college. two sessions cost about $7950. just for that. not including clothes, toiletries, bedding etc. my dad says not to be heart broken if i don't get to go. and i said, i really don't think i can do that. i <em>need </em>this. i need to be on my own. and start somewhat new without leaving my whole life behind. honestly, if i do this then i think i will come out more like myself then i've ever been. i'll be more confident, myself. i'll really shine like i'm supposed to.<br /><br />i could do this. but money is always an issue. if i even talk about this with my mom she great upset. and i really don't understand why. i mean, it's not like i'm staying there forever. just 3 or 6 weeks. i really want to go for&nbsp;6 weeks though. from my sweet sixteen money and the money from my dad, then i can totally do it. but my mom says that i don't understand. and how she uses the money to support me. but doesn't she have her own job. doesn't she get her own income. that money is supposed to be for me. it's called child support for a reason. obviously, i don't see her looking like a 16 year old girl. so rightfully, that money belongs to me. i understand if she uses it. really i do. but&nbsp;i <em>really really</em> want to do this. can't she just give up the money (which is only $187.50 a week) for 12 weeks? that's not alot to ask. but i guess in retrospect it might be. if she does that then she doesn't even have to pay for anything. just probably my clothes and tolietries. but thats basically nothing compared to tution and fees.<br /><br />get this, she says i'm not allowed to talk about Explo (name of the program) until after my sweet sixteen (March 1st). that's such bullshit. really it is. we need to work this out and not keep it off until the last minute when i can't get in. i understand that the swwet sixteen is alot to handle but we have almost everything done. she even said it herself, when i asked her if we could do sweet sixteen stuff. she's like ""what more do we have to do?"". and it's not that much. just music (i can do that easily), centerpieces (ordering pictures and whatnot), and favors. that's it i think. and then it's all done. i was lucky to even get a place for my sweet sixteen. we always do everything late. it's unfair. putting everything off until the last minute until we can't do it anymore. if i want to get into this progam, i have to apply now. thank the good lord, that they are having a informational meeting friday january 25 at 7. at the huntington hilton too. so like then there's no excuse for not going and seeing how great this program is. i have my heart set on this, and i won't give up until i go. no matter what it takes.<br /><br />i don't think the money would be a problem if brian had a real job. he just does little side jobs for southern (mom's work). he's densil macchic and he could make good money. personally, i think it's because he's lazy. and it's not that i don't like brian. it's just that he hasn't really made things easier for us. we are really struggling to make ends meet now. and he hasn't held down a steady job since him and my mom got married (2 years ago this june).now, if i may say so myself, that's a bit ridicous. because all his jobs have either ""fired"" him (he could have quite possibly quit but told us that story) or he actually did quit. i dont think i'll ever truly understand him. nor do i think&nbsp;i want to. it's just easier that way, not asking so people won't tell you unwatned answers.<br /><br />to truly vent out all my supressed anger and emotion would take a lifetime. well, maybe a few hundred journal entries. i'll never understand social norms and why we ahve to abide by them. i'll never understand step-dads and how they are supposed to be a good thing. i'll never understand how my mom operates. but without knowing it, i'm probably just like her. i'll never understand why we realy need money to survive.&nbsp;i'll never understand why noone hasn't bothered to break down this barrier between myself and the real world. maybe i'm meant to teach the world a true lesson on vaule and self-evaulation. who knows. who really knows.<br /><br />insanely yours,<br />angelia simeti</font>"

"event","<br /><font size=""1"">before anyone reads this, i warn you, it can get a little weird. these are all my inner thoughts. it's challenging to express them in words without sounding like a totally nutter. but i'm almost pouring my heart out. so don't judge. just love. continue mental meltdown part I.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />i think i should be offically certified as insane. i hear voices. yes, voices you didn't hear me wrong. well actually it's only one voice. it's like the 'anti-angelia', in my opinion. she keeps putting me down. and it's horrible.&nbsp;constantly being reminded by your 'alter-ego' that your nothing, useless, failular&nbsp;to life, not being a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;daughter, sister,&nbsp;or&nbsp;just perfect in general. it's very angsty when you add it all up. i've been trying so hard to just live life and focus&nbsp;on things that need to be focused on. but no, everytime&nbsp;i'm in&nbsp;'the&nbsp;zone' anti-angelia comes out and taunts me. it's&nbsp;dreadful actually. and my only means of escaping her is&nbsp;my imagination. yeah, i know it sound ridicously far-fetched but honestly, it works. writing fanfiction (which is fictional stories about your favorite book, tv show anything. it's amazing). some people&nbsp;might say reading fanfic and writing it so abnormal. but its just a&nbsp;hobby, it's not like i'm obsessed or&nbsp;anything. now, i won't lie and say i wasn't obsessed a bit. because yeah, i was. but only because it was a means of escaping my life (not that its horrible) and more importantly escaping anti-ange. i honestly have to say she's brutal sometimes. she always comes out when i'm alone or depressed&nbsp;or just thinking. i&nbsp;also think thats why i always&nbsp;talk and argue with myself. i'm&nbsp;kinda venting my anger out on something you can't see.&nbsp;at first, i thought for sure i was hallucinating or going delusional or something. i mean, wouldn't <em>you</em> find it just a tad odd that your&nbsp;talking (and sometimes arguing) with yourself. something or someone that no one can see but you. yeah. i'm insane.<br /><br />i'm about as normal as ever. and yet, i'm really not. i guess it has alot to do with expressing yourself ya know? like other kids (teenagers more like it) express themselves through anger (i.e- punching stuff), writing (i.e- poerty or songs), music (i.e- obviously playing an instrument) or sports (i.e football). but me, no i can never be THAT normal. i express myself throught writing yes, but more like fanfic (or poetry but deep poetry), harry potter (ok, ok, i i know what your&nbsp;thinking. harry potter?! um yeah, shes insane. noone&nbsp;can <em>express</em> themselves from a book.) yeah well, then i'll be the first. harry potter helps me get away from my world (like fanfic). i can dive into a mysterious and unknown (althought now i know almost everything about HP) world that i dont know and just adventure without caring.&nbsp;to try and see what character your most like (me, i have several.) to understand (and FULLY comprhend) where harry's comming from. i honestly, dont think i'll ever be normal. i'm different. born to be different. eccentric is more like it.<br /><br />pressure. i.hate.pressure. seriously thought if pressure was a person, it'd be dead a longgggg time ago. i deal with pressure in a different way than most people i know. some take it out by cutting (i'm a bit squemsh so that suggestion is out). some take it out by eating (i'll end up getting full and then i'll just get depressed again). some tell other people. see, thats my problem. yes, ladies and gents, i have a problem. i can talk to people. yeah, i love doing that. i just don't want to be a burden on anyone. people have more important things to worry about then little (big acutally) angelia. i talk to mrs. charity. yeah she's cool. but in 40 mintues i dont have enought time to say whats <em>really</em> on my mind. i just skim the surface. i deal with pressure by shoving it off until i can't possibly take it anymore (i.e this morning. january 15, 2008). i never cry. like fully cry. i haven't in a while. my friends think it's cause i'm strong (which in a certain respect i am). but personally, i think it's because my body can't produce enough tears. and i deffinetly can't cry on contact. nooo way. maybe a tear or two but no full blown wailing or anything.<br /><br />i cried this morning. like really cried. at first i thought it was because i was trying to fake getting out of school (which, in actuallity i really am sick &amp; overly-exhasted) but it grew into so much more. i saw anti-ange this morning. and she scared the crap out of me. her hair was limp and dead. skin was pale and waxy looking (like sirius black when he got out of azkaban. sorry. Harr Potter reference. it tends to happen). her eyes were emotionless and blank. she was talking about how i'm a true failular and that i'm being exactly what she wants me to be. nothing. emotionless. a blank sheet that no one cares about. now, let me just say that this morning was probably the most angst i've ever been. ever. in my life. ever. i cried for about a good 5 mintues straight on the couch next to polly. then i got up (i have no idea how though. i don't remmeber walking physically) went into my mom's room and started crying again. this time hard. i was saying something. something about pressure and perfect something. honestly, i can't remember much of it. and the sad part is, she didn't even comfort me. put an arm around me and say it was going to be ok. it broke my heart. it really did. let me just say that i know , for a fact, that my mom loves me. and that she's not (nor will she ever be) a bad mother. ever. in her life. ever. but at that moment anti-ange was saying hateful hateful things about her. and then i started crying even harder. anti ange was saying how she didn't love us and how she didn't care. but i know that's not true. i aruged back that she does love us. more than we know. and we take it for granted everyday. we never give her the apperication that she deserves. we just worry about ourself. no one else. no one else matters. then anti-ange said we need to guard ourselves. always have our head above others. they are nothing compared to us. and then she had the auducity to say that she would take over. anti- angelia take over <u>MY</u> body. sorry hun, i don't think so. i then cried for another good 10 or 20 mintues i don't really remember much though. it was like i was in a haze. mom was trying to talk. but i hardly listened. well, i heard her and comprehended what she was saying but i didn't actually process it. you know what the scary thing is, i think i'm losing myself. i'm slowly drifting away. and no one can bring me back.<br /><br />i feel alone. although, i know i'm not. i always have people by me. and i know that. i wish that someone would break this barrier that i have up and help me. i know it's going to be a long journey from here. but i'm willing to make the necessary sacifices in order to change this. i don't want to change myself. i love myself. my TRUE personality. and not this fake blah personality i put up to show everyone. yeah, the blah-pesonality is some of the REAL REAL me. but not all. so if someone, anyone understands what i'm going through, help me. help me please.<br /><br /><br />insanely yours,<br />angelia louise.<br /></font>&nbsp;"

Just sitting and swimming (not even). seriously dudes, i'm dying over here! and on top of that i have no one to talk to. except maybe my mom, but shes another story. At times, i think my <strong><u>""new family""</u></strong> doesn't even like me. and then other times i think that they love me. Although, the way i feel about them is also a different story. They, in my opinion, are very stuck up. i was supposed to go to Busch Gardens today, but, i was sick this morning. damn allergies. hahha. so then i got yelled at <em>being sick</em>. like seriously, how stupid can you get. gees. and we were supposed to go to the beach. which i might add, i gourgous beyond belieff!!!!! and what am i doing right now? sitting inside, because there aren't enough seats outside on the lanei and writing absoultly nothing interesting that i know&nbsp; no one will read. and outside, the <u><strong>""new family""</strong></u> is playing Mexican Tag or Mexican Gulf card game (wft). this is absoultly insane. kill me now, while i'm still willing. when i'm bored i'll problly write in here again. which, i'm guessing, will be very <strong>very</strong> very soon.</font></p>"

"event","i choose carrot cake!! mm...

No cheating. Pick your dessert, then look to see what psychiatrists think about you! After taking this dessert personality test, send this e-mail on to others, but when you do, be sure to put your choice of dessert in the subject line. ALSO, SEND IT TO THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU! 

If all of the desserts listed below were sitting in front of you, which would you choose? (Sorry, you can only pick one!) 

Angel Food 
Brownies 
Lemon Meringue 
Vanilla Cake/Chocolate Icing 
Strawberry Short Cake 
Chocolate Cake/Chocolate Icing 
Ice Cream 
Carrot Cake 

NO .. You can't change your mind once you scroll down! So think carefully what your choice will be! 

OK - Now that you've made your choice, this is what research says about you: 


Angel food - Sweet, loving, cuddly. You love all warm and fuzzy items.. A little nutty at times. Sometimes you need an ice cream cone at the end of the day. Others perceive you as being childlike and immature at times. 

Brownies - You are adventurous, love new ideas, are a champion of underdogs and a slayer of dragons. When tempers flare up, you whip out your saber. You are always the oddball with a unique sense of humor and direction. You tend to be very loyal. 

Lemon Meringue - Smooth, sexy, &articulate with your hands, you are an excellent after-dinner speaker and a good teacher. But don't try to 
walk and chew gum at the same time. A bit of a diva at times, but you have many friends. 

Vanilla Cake/Chocolate Icing - Fun-loving, sassy, humorous. Not very grounded in life; very indecisive and lack motivation. Everyone enjoys 
being around you, but you are a practical joker. Others should be cautious in making you mad. However, you are a friend for life. 

Strawberry Short Cake - Romantic, warm, loving. You care about other people and can be counted on in a pinch. You tend to melt. You can be 
overly emotional and annoying at times.

Chocolate Cake/Chocolate Icing - Sexy, always ready to give and receive. Very creative, adventurous, ambitious, and passionate. You have a 
cold exterior but are warm on the inside. Not afraid to take chances. Will not settle for anything average in life. Love to laugh. 

Ice Cream - You like sports, whether it be baseball, football, basketball, or soccer. If you could, you would like to participate, but you enjoy watching sports. You don't like to give up the remote control. You tend to be self-centered and high maintenance. 

Carrot Cake - You are a very fun loving person, who likes to laugh. You are fun to be with. People like to hang out with you. You are a very warm hearted person and a little quirky at times. You have many loyal friends."

Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me 

Everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby"

1. im supposed to be a college student on a front porch after a big meal who needs to make a big decision... here it goes...

I DO :by amanda tomasco

""Will you marry me, Danielle"" are the words that are ringing in my head. I had a month off, then graduation and i am earning a bachelor's degree in Pre-Med. My life is just starting out! What am I going to do?
   Jon and I had been dating all throughout college. I love him and he loves me.. that sort of thing. For our vacation, he and I are traveling to louisiana. ""i cant wait for you to meet my parents!' jon said in excitement. I was excited and nervous all at the same time. Im just a small new england girl from_______(i need a city). ""i dont know if i can remember all the names of your family' i said nervously. ""dont worry Dan, youll do fine."" Jon said with a smile on his face.
   As the plane landed, I felt this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach. Something is going to happen. I dont know if it is good or bad. We drove up the long , dirt driveway. I have never been on a real farm. ""this is amazing JOn. You grew up here??"" ""yea! but dont let it deceive you though. It is a lot of work!"" As we walked up to the front door I went over the list of names in my head. ""Father-Dave, Mom- JoAnn, Brother-James, and sister-Karen""
    'JON! You're home!"" screamed JoAnn, his mom. ""oh look at our little boy ! And this must be Danielle. Come in come in"" His mom was the perfect image of a mother , hair neately pinned back and an apron on over it. As i greeted each family member it seemed like they were perfect. Dave, his father, was just what a farmer should look like, a scruffy 5 o'clock shadow, a cotton flannel shirt, and jeans. ""hi danielle, how are ya? Im Dave"" he said in a deep voice. ""im fine glad to be here finally"" i said as i sat on one side of the couch. Just then i herd poundingsof feet. A boy and girl ran down the stairs. ""That must be James and Karen"" jon said to me as he sat down next to me. ""kids go see Jon!"" JoAnn said from the kitchen. The aroma that came from that room smelt like we were in a five star resturant. Jon's sister Karen must have been at least 10 years old. She rean up to Jon and gave him a big hug. ""JON! I mised you!"" She said as her bouncy blonde curls covered jons face. ""I missed you too!, Karen this is Danielle."" Jon said. I smiled and said hello. ""HI"" she said... ""do you like Kenny chesney?"" ""Ummm.. actually i do "" i said with a laugh. James must have been 13 or 14 because he just sat dowm playing Donkey Kong on his gameboy. ""hey James "" Jon said ""Hey"" he repllied. ""kids these days"" jon said . Dave, Jon, and I all laughed. ""dinner! Joann screamed from the dining room.
   did you kids wash your hands?"" Joann said to them.""yes mommy! see??"" Karen said loudly. ""how about you? James?"" ""yea ma"" he said. We all sat around the large dining room table. Sitting on the table looked like the most delicious foon I have ever seen! Stuffed turkey, peas, carrots, and apple pie! my favorite! We ate until our stomachs were about to burst. just as i finished jon stood up, tapping his glass. ""Um everyone, I have a very improtant question."" he walked quickly over to me and kneeled on one knee. ""Danielle, will you marry me??!"" he said nervously as he pulled out the diamond ring. There was a lump in my throat. I was speechless. ""i...uhh...umm"" ""oh.. how romantic"" joann said as they awaited my answer. ""I think I need some air"" I said and ran to the porch.
   Those words are repeating and repeating in my head. ""Im not ready for this, but i love jon , but im only 23 years old."" Not knowing what to say, I slowly walked in. Their eyes starred wondering what i would say. Jon ran over. ""Jon I love you"" ""I love you too"" he quickly replied. ""Let me finish"" I said ""I love you but i cant marry you. ""im too young  and i have my whole life ahead of me."" I looked down to the hardwood floor and kicked some dust around. ""Baby I love you and i understand where you are going."" jon said sadly ""Im sorry honey"" i said and hugged him.
  By the next month Jon and I broke up. He couldnt get over that huge refusal. 3 months later in july Jon got married. We stayed in touch and he later had a family. As for me, I still love him. I have my job and a lot of money but no one else to share it with. Sometimes in the dark of night I lay awake in bed wondering if i had made the right decision that day in the farmhouse.

TUESDAY: i was really really sick! i stayed home from school for the first time this year! poo

I did my tarot card reading today.. something has really been bothering me and i just needed to find out what to do and to see what they said... 

that got me interested in the Wiccan religion.. its really interesting.. one quote that really interested me is this 

"" If you take the Bible and put it out in the wind and rain the pages would eventually disintigrate, our (Wiccan) Bible is the wind and rain."" 

i got that from a Godsmack website ... b/c Sully (the lead singer) is Wiccan.. well i am jjust interested in that religion. Just to explain a little more.. Wiccan is 'witch craft' but doesnt have to do with Satan or anything like that!

I Gotta Vent!!!

-- Some asshole has really been bothering me lately.. He's a jerk and I hate him. I dont wish anything bad upon him, I just want him to realize I dont like him and to stop bothering me. I hope he can see that I dont like him and leave me alone!!!

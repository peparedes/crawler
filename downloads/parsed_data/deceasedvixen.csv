In 14 hours, we organized a rally which drew 800 students, administrators, faculty, alumni, and community members. I made 300 candles for additional people who couldn't make it but wanted to be represented.
All together, the number of people who participated was greater than the number of students in the class of 2008.
The President of the College cut his trip out of town so he could come back to speak. 
And it felt so fucking beautiful."

Write about your screenname, why you chose it, what it means to you, etc.

I started my journal when I was...15? I think. I loved nothing better than taking TheSpark tests, and this name came from their Personality Test. It kept telling me that I was The Vixen...something about chewing men up and spitting them up and always needing to be desired. Which seemed pretty accurate at the time. As for the Deceased...yeah, I was also pretty goth back then. 

What would you change your name to, if you were changing it?

Hmm...probably hedgehogsinmyboxers if it was allowed. I'm on a big hedgehog kick at the moment. I'd actually really like to change it, as I am no longer goth nor a maneater.

What is your favorite username? Why?
I like asexual_amoeba lots, even if you don't sheera :). ikickpuppies also sorta turns me on.

"event","Eeep...so this hasn't exactly been the month of multitudinous updates like it was supposed to be, mostly because I am busy like whoa. I'm taking three courses, all of which I enjoy a lot, but I have a lot of reading. They are : Socy 79: War and Society, Ling 23: Semantics and Pragmatics, and JWST 21: Intro to Hebrew and Israeli Culture. I have two British professors, one of which being Glinert, the Hogwarts candidate that I've always talked about. The other one, Professor Hall, sniggers when he mentions wars that the british won. It's funny :). 
I managed to solve my major crisis by...avoiding it! That's right, I just didn't submit my major card. There's no penalty til summer, so I predict another freak-out then. I'll keep ya posted.
Other than schedule stress (split between school, work, chamber singers, and Mentors Against Violence), life is amazingly good. I know it's probably not *just* because Dawn isn't here this term, but I feel like I've felt less social stress since I've been back than ever before. I'm just...happy. I guess it's only the third week, so a little early to tell, but I'm actually surrounded by the people I like, and only the people I like. I really like and appreciate both my roommates, and of course Mike is still the best part of my life :). I'm meeting some more really cool people through MAV, so hopefully friendships will continue to grow that way. 

Ok. So Mike is in the most awesome fraternity ever. Last weekend, a couple of members decided, along with a few brothers of Zeta Psi, to buy a lamb. A ram lamb. He was about 6 months old, white and brown, incredibly fuzzy and adorable, named Paul Newman. You can find photographs of him on thefacebook if you search for Paul Newman -The Lamb-. He lived in the house for a night or two...he totally bonded with one of the brothers. It was a-fucking-dorable. I was in love. But they had to take him back due to a lack of housing : (. However, they did have him moved to a nearby farm for weekend visitation. So ok, maybe it *would* have been the coolest frat ever, but they took him back for humane reasons, which makes them nice. 

I miss everyone back home...the thought that I'm not gonna see most of y'all for 6 months is both sad and depressing. I love you all dearly. .And y'all should go on AIM more often!!! I am there sometimes.

Laura"

I spent the first two days back on campus pretty much attached to Mike. Which was heavenly. So effin happy :D. Sorry guys, I know we're gross : P. 
Anyway, I'm in this huuuuuge inner conflict right now, after finding out that major cards are due NEXT WEEK. Suddenly I don't know if I really care about sociology enough to actually major about it...problem is, I don't know what I do want really want to study. And for some reason I'm utterly opposed to going to talk to a Dean or someone about it...still can't quite figure out why. Right now there's 5 different classes I want to take this term (the norm is 3) and two of them are at the same time. One of those I want to take, and one I *should* take. So conflicted :(. Not to mention I'm going to be working, doing sexual violence prevention training two hours a week, doing chamber singers...Thank God mike has a pseudo-single. At least if we don't see each other enough during the day we can sleep together. 
However, being back with Dartmouth folks is awesome. I think Lena and Kim are going to make really good roommates. Dinner today lasted about an hour just due to all the ab-shaking laughter. And Sig Nu is throwing a Euro-Trash Party on Saturday. Orange tube top and pink spandex anyone?

"event","I've been feeling strangely depressed lately. Well, I guess it's not that strange, but nonetheless uncomfortable. School and work have been combining to keep me at a pretty high stress level- I had to critique 15 freshmen's papers this week, with three midterms in the next two weeks, spaced out enough that I'll still have homework for other classes while I'm trying to study for them. Fall is really setting in, and it's been raining all weekend. Mike is now pledging at Sigma Nu Fraternity, Inc. (!), which I think will be healthy for him, but nonetheless scares me a little bit. On top of this, I naively decided to watch Practical Magic again the other night, not realizing the effect it would have on me. It used to be one of me and Rachael's favorite movies, we'd watch it all the time. Watching all the scenes we used to watch together, and then just being bombarded by the whole ""power of family"" theme just broke me down. I used to have a completely different family- four other people who I lived with and shared life with for ten years. I haven't spoken to Brenda in five years, and I think it's been four since I talked to Michael; but they were the ones who abandoned me. As for my dad and Rachael...He was my role model, and she was my sister. Now, I don't even know how to talk to them. Worse, I usually don't even want to. It just depresses me too much. Most of the time, I just block out the fact that these people even exist to me; I've perfected my ability to forget. And on some level, this makes me infinitely sad."

The last two days have actually been kind of nice, just lying on the couch all day, reading, watching movies, napping, and having people bring me food. I could really get used to it if I could eat more than soup, flan and eggs. Thank god for flan. Delicious delicious flan.
Exactly one week from now, I'll be back at the Manchester airport, waiting for the bus to take me back to school. I have mixed feelings about this. It's kinda lonely here, since all my friends are back at school, and it will be divine to be back with Mike again. God I love that boy. I'm really excited about my classes too. I'm just afraid that the drama will come back and start fucking with my head again. And it's always really depressing for me to leave California. I definitely belong here. 
Mike is leading a group of little 09's around the New Hampshire wilderness right now. Awwww. Let's hope they all come back alive :)

I awoke yesterday morning to hear my stepdad talking to our nextdoor neighbor in the living room. As our walls are hella thin, I could get a pretty good idea of what they were saying. I heard her saying something about ""she wakes me up early in the morning"" and Rick saying something like ""I didn't realize she was out so late."" So I wait til Rick leaves for work and then get up and get dressed. He stops back by the house a little later, chats a bit and asks me what time I got it. I assume that he already knows the truth, so I figure, hey, I'll play the honesty card and at least have that going for me. I tell him 5, and he freaks out. Later that night, as I'm washing dishes, I hear him discussing with my mom how the neighbor came over that morning and that he finally complained to her about *her dog* waking him up early in the morning. He had no idea. Fuxxors.
So now he's saying that I'm grounded. Yes, I know it's ridiculous, but it's true. He's trying to ground a college student. Hopefully this won't bode I'll for the bbq tomorrow, but he's been a hell of a shithead recently. I haven't had a chance to explain my side yet though."

My social life is starting to feel exactly like sophomore year of high school. I have friends who I used to feel really close with, but don't anymore. I have a boyfriend whom I love, and seem to be spending increasing amounts of time with, which is good, but also makes me realize that I'm leaning on him in order to escape dealing with what's going on with my friends, and burdening him with all the shit I feel because of them. I feel paranoid, unwanted, and angry, but can't see any way to resolve these feelings and hold onto my friendships. It feels so much like 2002 that I want to gag. I hate losing the people I trust.
This is only complicated by the fact that I'm rooming with these same people next year, unless I find an alternate living situation, and fast. It seems like making it to the end of this term is going to be difficult enough.
On the bright side, I am recognizing what's going on, and trying to be proactive about it. I'm trying to meet new, hopefully more compatible people...I'm tentatively joining the rugby team, which should accomplish both meeting people and feeling better about my body, unless it breaks (my body, not the team). Mike is amazing, and helps me so much whenever I feel I'm on the edge. The weather has turned warm again, and I have a light class load, which should amount to less stress from school. I'll be in New Zealand for winter term next year, so I'll only be rooming with the same people for Fall...hopefully I'll get close to some people on my FSP. And it's less than two months til summer. Then I can see my wonderful friends again. 
I just wish these cycles would stop.

"event","Yesterday we had the first significant snow of the year- only four or five inches, but that's enough. So, as Dartmouth tradition calls for, word went around about the Snowball Fight on the Green. At 11:45, we all pulled on our snow gear: snow boots, long underwear, hats, scarves, thick gloves. As midnight struck, me and my friends tromped out of the dorm and joined the stream of people heading for the Green. Reaching the edge, we bent down and grabbed the snow, powdery but still ball-able, and rushed toward the hundreds of people already there. Too unsure to hit strangers at first, we searched out friends and enemies and attacked them first. Eventually, though, all dissolved into chaos. Friends were separated from each other, reunited, then separated again as each ran and dodged to avoid would-be attackers or avengers. We lobbed snowballs through the air to fall haphazardly into the crowd, or just attacked random people who looked like they deserved it. At one point about six of us waged all-out war on a group of girls who had been ganging up on Anna. We threw, we rubbed, we tackled, we conquered. At another point, we launched a personal vendetta against the freshman Dog Day Players. When the snow finally penetrated through all of our layers (and our hair, random fact: snowballs + hair= dredlocks) we made a weary retreat;  we'd been out there in the battle for over an hour. We stripped off layers all the way up the stairs, showered, and enjoyed hot mugs of raspberry cocoa. 

The End."

I'm gonna be around for three weeks, so I want to see y'all! Is there a REACH meeting next wednesday? I'm planning on coming to SM too. Did Madrigal already happen? Write me or call 892-5285 if you want to hang out!

"event","Despite my numerous vows to sleep, i haven't gone to bed before 3 since my first night here. Between our underwear party and the frats, i have the feeling i'm gonna start regretting living like this sooner or later. I blame it on my roommate being a party animal. So far i've refrained myself from getting drunk or hooking up...go me! Although i would've preferred not to be babysitter last night. Oh well, it was fun anyway. Today I had an audition for the chamber groups, tomorrow is a cappella auditions. I don't think i did all that great, and i don't anticipate it tomorrow either, but I gotta try. i can't imagine not singing. I pick classes tomorrow too. woohoo. God I am so tired.

"event","So Dartmouth so far (and by so far i mean for the past four days) is awesome. There are ups and downs, and for some strange, completely inexplicably reason the downs seem to come in the morning after not nearly enough hours of sleep. I miss everyone back home much. But I'm learning new things, like that I still love dancing as much as I did in middle school, and that spending 13 hours in a day with the same guy is waaay too much. And that there can indeed be good parties thrown in dorm rooms, sleazy guys notwithstanding. As a result of marking myself as an ""undecided"" major, I have ended up with a faculty advisor who teaches studio art. The weather so far has been great. My roommates are excellent, and my room is pretty cool (half bath, need I say any more). The girls on my floor are pretty tight, and the guys downstairs are fun. The showers kinda blow though : P. Classes don't start til wednesday, so I'm half enjoying the lack of responsibility and half eager to get into full swing and get to meet even more people. That's the thing about people in college...they're EVERYWHERE. I successfully slept in til 10 this morning, but as its now 11:30 i sense shower time coming on. Hope you folks are all enjoying yourselves.

Laura"

I'm spending 4 days with my aunt in burlington, VT before heading to campus.
Then a 4 day DOC trip canoeing on the Connecticut River.
Then it all really, really starts.
I'm amazed.
My duffel bag is (significantly) bigger than I am. 
Saying goodbye to my friends has been strange.
I imagine saying goodbye to my parents will be difficult.
I'll miss everyone. Except for you. Yeah, you. I never liked you anyway ; ).

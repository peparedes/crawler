"event","last winter (2007), after i moved out, my parents started a HUGE construction project on their house. it was really intense, as in they raised the whole thing and added several new feet of... wall, so that the ceilings in the downstairs were of a normal height. they also turned the cruddy wood-panelled, asbestos-tiled basement i used to inhabit into an office for my dad, who's an architect. anyway, all the renovations meant they had to move out of the house for a while, and they stayed at the rental house a few blocks away. 

at the time, they had 3 cats, owen and idgie came with them to the rental house and became temporary indoor cats. my 14 year old cat emmett was basically feral, we only saw him once every few weeks when he'd come inside to eat and would immediately leave again. when they moved, they just left food out for him and figured he'd just kind of do his own thing for a while until they came back. before you jump down my throat about it, he seriously never came around, and didn't stick around when he did, and forcing him to be an indoor cat at another house seriously would have killed him. it just wouldn't have happened. anyway, they left him at the house, finished the construction, and moved back in, and emmett never showed back up. he was really old so we all kind of figured he'd gone off and just died peacefully somewhere, but we always joked that he was just   show up again one day like it was no big deal. and that's totally what he did! my sister was on the back deck and he just walked right up! this cat has been gone for over a year and a half, it's like he came back from the dead. i freaked out and cried on the phone like a wuss when she told me. apparently he's been hanging around the house more and more, though, and i kind of think he's been on some homeward bound-style adventure for a while, and now is just going to spend his last kitty months chilling out at casa del schuyler.

he makes me believe cats ~really do have 9 lives~ 
he's been through all kinds of hell, i think he even got hit by a car at one point and was ok. his previous owners basically abused him, locking him in the garage without enough food or water, and they had 2 young sons that beat the snot out of him, and he was my sweetie after we took him in. he's always been a hunter, too, and brought me live and dead snakes and bats and lizards and mice. awwww i hope i get to see him soon!

1 large overripe banana
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2c whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon

optional:
1c of raisins, other dried fruit, peanut butter, walnuts, (dark) chocolate chips, etc etc
dashes of curry powder for the adventurous

1. heat oven to 350F
2. beat together margarine and sugar until creamy
3. add vanilla and the banana, chop it up and stir/mash into the sugar mix.
4. add combined flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, mix well.
5. stir in oats, then whatever add-ins you want. peanut butter is a good fix here if they're too dry
6. scoop and bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes, err on the side of undercooked because they'll harden a bit.

now we have way too many!

we had a huge house party friday night, for reva's birthday. i may have taken a drunken tumble off the porch, but it was a great night. my digital camera has gone missing, but i think it just may be post-party paranoia and it'll show up stashed somewhere weird in a few days. everything out in the open was eaten, all the drinkable liquid in the fridge got... drank? we kept up the keg all of yesterday. it finally died down when jordan took revenge on our hammock chair, and then the porch took revenge on his face. alcohol and that porch really should try to get along a bit better, i say.

this morning when we dumped the keg trashcan, there was a dead frog in there. how it got in there is beyond me. i like to think it came in already frozen in a bag of ice... what's your hypothesis?"

The other current project, should I keep it blotchy or paint it flat white with gold teeth? Or paint gold teeth on it blotchy? Puff paint never really fades so if I do flat white it'll be like that forever.

Um HOLYSHIT. That is 17 shift dresses, all IN MY SIZE and complete and well taken care of and I was seriously about to pee I was so excited. Plus, they were 10 cents apiece! The yellow and purple/white dresses I've posted are actually made from a reproduction of one of the patterns I bought today, haha.

I picked our blueberry bush in my new yellow dress, which is not technically new. If I made it from vintage fabric, a vintage pattern, and even vintage thread, does it count as a vintage dress? I probably would have had to have sewn it on my vintage sewing machine, hahah.

I changed up the pattern layout a bit, the way they had it set up meant you had to cut almost every piece twice. By changing one of the straps that was supposed to be cut once on the bias, I cut two and sewed them together. It let me fit the whole pattern on the fabric folded in half, and just cut once.

<lj-cut text=""Thoughts on eulogy"">
A kid I was friends with my freshman and sophomore year, but I haven't seen since then, passed away yesterday morning. It's so strange to know a person and the first time you think about them in months is because you hear that they're dead. As sophomores we were grafittiing the bleachers of our school's sad gymnasium. He dropped out of school and apparently formed a habit bad enough to kill him, or so goes the speculation. 
""I heard he overdosed""
""Amelia didn't even know how he died... what did he OD on?""
""I'm assuming herion, that's the one that tends to do it""
Knowing Marc at the time in his life that I did, I'd at least have to say he would have taken some satisfaction on making his grand exit on Halloween."

Bringing the motherfucking ruckus (and holding up traffic.)

It's also only one day a year I get to drink red wine in a desanctified church and catch up with the parents of my friends in costume. The Song Titles party was excellent, I like to think Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes was a success, even if Diamonds on the Face of Evil was not and my Boy Named Sue was too sleepy to stand. Many days a year I get to catch up with old friends, as was the case Friday night. The case was also full of Busch beer. The sound of breaking glass alerted Isaac to one of the strangest shindigs I've ever been to, happening right next to Jessica's garage apartment. It was full of girls who used to be thin and weren't willing yet to accept the fact that they no longer were. Spandex is an invention of the devil, my dear comrades.

The coming week holds promise. Tilly and the Wall and Broken Social Scene, plus two movies playing that I'd really like to see, especially Delicatessen from the director of Amelie. Should be a treat, I'm looking forward to it. Now it's time to put away my clean undies that Jeremy used as a pillow on the ride home. Clean laundry has become a thing to look forward to."

GET THEE TO YE MANMAN SHOW.

It was probably the most crowded I've seen Club Downunder (flannel EVERYWHERE.)
ManMan wasn't a phenomenon, they had sort of a circusy sound. They were fun, but like Frederick said it was too easy to pick out their influences. Some of the riffs felt a little Tom-Waits-y, so you know I'm down with that.
The opening act was fun as hell, though. Girltalk, another great band that is a dancing man with a computer. His samples cover such a huge range of music but it blends very artfully and was a lot of fun. FUN FUN FUN.

"event","Worst string of luck EVER:
Monday: left my chargers for my computer AND phone in Saint Augustine
Tuesday: left my keys in Kate's apartment while she was at work, wound up waiting around in the hallway for her suitemate.
Wednesday: lost my WALLET on the way to class!
I now have no ID, credit card, student ID, phone, or computer. I may as well not exist. At least Jerms lent me some money and helped me look for the wallet. I'm Charlie Brown incarnate.

(Using my roommate's computer, bee-tee-dub)

Still feeling alright, though, even though this wallet extravaganza is gonna cost me like...$120. Ugh."

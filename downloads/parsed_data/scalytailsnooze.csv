"event","There was this guy looked like head of Square Enix from Decline of Video Gaming (that's a Flash toon series on Newgrounds.com, too lazy to link) who had released a pamphlet promoting really crappy pet care techniques and a new way of curing disease through religion and other diseases.

He somehow had a cult gathering and people were going to him to be infected with hepatitis, because apparantly hepatitis was better than whatever illness they had before.

I went to him with someone else and we posed as a Spanish couple seeking advice. The room we went into looked like my front room.
He came in and we started asking him probing questions that he got a bit nervous about.
Eventually we managed to usher him over to a window. When he was near enough we pushed him through it forcefully.
We then proceeded to tell him everything that was wrong with his cult and he just lay there bleeding.

Somehow we managed to get through to him, and when he finally stood up he made a soup kitchen for the poor and homeless out of the room where his cult met.
I was so happy that I picked up a Barbie doll, pushed a My Little Pony baby into her arms and ran down the street (which looked a lot like my street). People were pulling over in their cars saying how cute it was.
After all the initial excitement had died down, the man announced that he was opening a 24/7 homeless shelter. Everyone started asking where the money was going to come from.

There was a really weird and tacky clone of Neopets that somehow appeared. I was guiding a character through a Flash forest game, but then I stopped playing because i might get into trouble.

It suddenly became night and everyone went upstairs to bed. There was a view of a woman in her bed, and then the ""camera"" moved to show a girl in her bed. She was dreaming about something, and the ""camera"" zoomed in closer until there was a fade-out to her dream.

The man was at an awards ceremony for crazy people with tons of other people. They showed clips of the other people doing their ""crazy"" things.
One man grabbed a giant beetle, showed it to the camera and then broke it open and ate it. He was also shown chowing down on a scruffy-looking hawk that was still alive and struggling.
Another clip showed a Bill Oddie-ish man who had invented a new trap. It was based on the 'loop of rope tightening around your leg and then suspending you upside down from a tree' trap, but his rope had a built -in heat sensor that detected body heat. He demonstrated by putting a stick in the trap. Nothing happened. When he put his hand in, the trap worked."

However, if something seems to exist, it might as well exist; in this case, one should act as though it does.  If something seems not to exist, it might as well not exist; one should act as if it doesn't.  However, since this existence or nonexistence of anything is irrelevant, one should not attach too much weight to one's perceptions in any such matter; someone else may see things differently, but there is no need to assume the existence of a conflict."

"event","Firstly, I would like to ask you, the reader, to please comment on any logical failures on my part, in areas where I am attempting to build a logical structure over my illogical premises.  I don't want to be inconsistant.  Anyway.

Corollary 6.4: Satan doesn't necessarily exist.  Neither does Hell.
Only documentation of these is 'inspired' or otherwise unreliable.  It is also worth noting that bad luck and free will create plenty of evil by themselves.
One could, by a similar method, seek to disprove the necessity of God's existence.  I suppose it's possible that God doesn't exist.  However, as I have a feeling to connect to God and none for Satan, I'm saying this.  This is belief, which while being irrational, is not the same as 'divine inspiration.'

Addition One:
I'll add this in an edit, later."

"event","1. How religious differences are irrelevant.
All religions are the same in one basic thing: they aren't right and, in fact, can't be right - or at least, can't be known to be right, because no-one knows what 'right' is.
Apart from that, there are certain common themes in today's major religions.  I won't talk about minor religions simply because I don't know much about them.  Major religions: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam.
 - There is one God, or at least one main God, perhaps with several different aspects.
 - God is loving.  At least sometimes.
 - There is a heaven.  Some people go to it; some go some other place.
They're fundamentally the same.  Just differ in the existence of other gods and what gets one into heaven, pretty much.  Okay - so they are rather different.  But if you look at them from far enough away, the fundamentals are the same.

2. God's omnipotence.
God is omnipotent.  There are two ways God could exercise power: by moving around matter or energy, or by interfering in human/animal affairs/minds.
   The first would be God going against the rules he set up for the universe.  The universe is bit like a lab experiment.  God set it up with certain parameters; while he could go against those, I don't believe he wants to.  It would destroy the whole point of having the laws.
   The second would be a sort of 'divine inspiration.'  This would, as I have said, be a violation of free will - unless, of course, God spoke as the little voice in our heads which we can choose to heed or deny.  Unfortunately, since God gives us free will, He wouldn't crush out the other little voices of our own creation."

"event","Because I'm writing about religion, a lot of stuff is going to be based purely on my own personal, illogical beliefs.  Fortunately, anything having to do with religion is illogical, so I'm in good company.  Each premise will be followed by a brief explanation of why I believe it.
I refer to God as 'He' for simplicity's sake.  If you have a problem with that, I may change it to 'She.'  Maybe even 'It,' but I personally think that sounds just a bit ridiculous.

1. There is a God.
Probably because I was raised that way.  I can't really comprehend not believing that God exists.  There's also the sense of wonder I occasionally have of nature and/or other people, which I associate with God.  I realize that this is probably due to endorphins and all that, but (as I said) religion is an illogical subject.

2. God created the universe.
I believe this because I do - although it would be more accurate to say that God created the framework of the universe - the laws that govern it.  There is no rational explanation for this one.
   Corollary One: Laws govern the universe; therefore, science is valid.

3. God is loving.
See explanation for number one.  Also, if God hated us, why make so many good things?  I suppose one could say that He's just leading us on so that when we lose everything it's even worse for us... but I prefer the simple explanation.

4. God doesn't will bad things.
Bad things happen - trees falling on people, etc.  This is not because God willed that tree to fall on that person, but rather because God created a world in which trees fall over - whether due to imbalance, wind, or whatever.  The tree falling is not, in and of itself, bad - the person just got unlucky.

5. Humans have free will.
We think; therefore, we have free will.  If a thinking being did not have free will, it would not be thinking - it would not be deciding.
If a being could somehow think without having free will, it would not be loved.  Rather, it would be repressed.
   Corollary One: Divine inspiration
'Divine inspiration' (Note the quote marks) is something where God takes someone over and writes down the unadulterated Truth.  This does not exist because a takeover would be unloving even if someone thought they wanted it to happen.
True divine inspiration, if it exists, is the human yearning to do what's right without even knowing what 'Right' is.
   Corollary Two: Bad Deeds
Some people, due to free will, choose not to search for what is right.  So they kill people.  Yes, they do more than that - but I'm leaving it up to your imagination what.

6. The Bible is fallible.
'Divine Inspiration' does not exist; therefore, the Bible is not Truth; rather, it is a collection of works by people trying to do what's right and figure out what exactly 'Right' is.
   Corollary One: No religion can know what Truth and Right are.  Maybe someone's got it; maybe not.
   Corollary Two: Heaven may not exist.
The only documentation of heaven is the Bible.  Possibly other purportedly inspired documents.  So it may exist; on the other hand, it may not.
   Corollary Three: Jesus may not be divine.
Pretty much the same reason as 6.2.

7. I am fallible.
I have free will.  I'm no more divinely inspired than anyone else.  Sure, I think my religious ideas are a bit closer to the mark than some of those followed today.  But, alternatively, even though I think I'm right, I believe I could just be completely wrong.  To err is human.

I'm going to stop there for now.  What I'll explain some other time:
 - Why we should do good deeds.
 - What good deeds are - what 'good' is.
 - Why religious differences are irrelevant.
 - Some other stuff I can't remember to mention right now for some reason.
 - Anything you suggest I ought to address."

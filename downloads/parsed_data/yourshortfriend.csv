"event","okay so enough with the rain already. we managed to open for part of the day on saturday and yesterday. but not the whole day. and well today is my day off. not like i haven't had enough days off but yeah. 

so everyday it rained i pretty much went to chris's house. yesterday i was so glad i had chris drive us to his house cause on the way it started raining so hard we couldn't see. and well i would of been way too scared to drive in that. so forget that. 

got up early this morning. tooo much noise. so i cleaned some. waiting to see if michelle needs a ride to work. i feel like a taxi. i drive everyone around. and i even get gas money. so i don't mind driving people around. as long as i get money to fill up the tank again. i am cool with it. i think today me, chris and hopefully britt are hanging out. maybe bowling or miniture golf or something, who knows. 

okay so last night i got home at like 10. and i waited outside my house for like 5 minutes. just because i was trying to get a big huge frog off the door nob. it wouldn't leave. no matter what i did. so i started to pound on the door. my dad opened it i was like ""open it slow there is a huge frog on it"" so he slammed it shut on me. then he opened it again ""its still there"" so it got slammed again in my face. then he came out with a broom and chased it down the stairs. crazy people. 

oh... funny story time! 

so i have been spending a lot of time with chris. but who cares we are friends and we aren't doing anything wrong. so who gives a crap right. well our parents do, and everyone at work. its constantly are you two an item now? are you two dating? whats going on between you two?... ect. we are just friends. yes i am sure it looks like we are more than just friends. maybe we are who knows. yes i do like him more than just friends but that doesn't matter. so saturday me, chris, brittany, john, joe and beverly were standing outside of work talking about if we were gonna open or not. it was like 10 something. chris and i had are arms around each other. we see a slow moving car. joe was like i think we got a customer. i looked... i was like nope... that's my dad. chris's arm flew off me so fast. it was funny. after work my parents were home. ""so sam, who were you on the phone with this morning?"" ""depends on what time you are talking about"" ""who were you on the phone with"" ""both chris and brittany"" ""ohhh"" ""whose chris?"" ""my friend"" ""how old is he"" ""17"" ""who have you been hanging out with everyday?"" ""chris"" ""is he your boyfriend"" ""no, we are just friends"" ""sure..... its okay if he is your boyfriend"" ""okay, but he's not"" ""then why was his arm around you"" ""cause we are friends"" ""friends normally dont have there arms around each other like you guys did today"" ""okay"" ""so who is in denial?"" ""no one"" ""sure, its either you two are gonna end up dating or you three are gonna have a three sum"" :::look like what the hell did you just say::: ""you didn't just say that"" and i walked away. yes my parents really did say that. shocking huh? sorry but i think the 3 of us will pass on the 3sum. crazy parents. 

oh another funny story. last night i was at chris's house. what a surprise right? we were watching movies and playing video games like always. and then we had dinner. chris's mom likes cookie cutters. she cut everyone's biscuts into different things. she cut mine and chris's into hearts. yeah, i think our parents are having too much fun with this."

FINALS ARE OVER!!! THANK GOD!!!!  NO MORE FINALS FOR A WHILE!!! LETS CELEBRATE. LOL. 

okay enough of that. i gotta work tomorrow. 4-6:30. the only time i work all week. stupid publix. i am gonna try to talk to my dad again about moving. although it really doens't matter any more cause my mom is filing for coustodey of me and she did that for joe and got him. so my dad will more than likely lose again. hopefully i'll be back in ohio by early march. i am not gonna have another shitty birthday down here. i want to have it up there with everyone. i can't wait to be back there will all my friends, and to be closer to my family and my mom. i can't wait. i gotta come visit down here though cause of my dad. but thats alright its only visiting and mabye i can get one of my friends to come to. to the few florida friends i have i'll miss ya guys but when i come visit we can hang out. 

i want to start to pack now. but i gotta be patient. lol. i can't wait!

"event","okay.... so i don't know when i will be moving. me and my dad have been fighting about it since saturday. doesn't that sound fun? he is being such an ass about it. let me the fuck go. and be happy back home. i want to be happy. dammit. why doesn't he understand that. godd. i am really tired of this. i don't need to put up with this. my mom is fully capable of taking care of me. he needs to let me make my own damn choice. i am sorry but i have control of my life. i don't need him trying to control my life. its my damn life. not his. he screwed it up moving me here. now i want to fix it. so let me fucking fix it. he thinks it would be a huge mistake for me to move in with her. well if it is let me make that mistake. but i bet its not a mistake. the mistake was me moving down here. its the only thing i regret in life. and i want to fix it. i want a chance to be close to my mom. to be happy. to be back with the people who care about me and know me. he needs to let me grow up and make a decision for meselft. and let me do what i feel is best. he got his happyness. now he needs to let me get mine."

"event","okay.... so i have noticed that a comment i have made in a previous entry has sparked some ideas and questions that to me don't see right cause we are friends and we should know each other better than that. but to clear things up here we go. the comment saying... ""sorry jaime and aaron for waking you guys up"" no aaron didn't sleep over. i called and woke him up. why would you guys even think that we'd have aaron sleep over jaime's house? seriuosly why? and i know that katie and joelle were mad or upset that they didn't get to say goodbye to me on the phone. you guys called me. i talked to you guys. we said bye. is there anything else. cause seriously let me know. i want to fix all this. and jaime isn't a whore. yeah she flirted and i know a lot of people think she was all over aaron. but if it were me doing that would you think the same. yeah i flirted. but i normally don't flirt a lot. everyone likes to flirt. everyone flirst a lot too. so someone please explain to me why is jaime a whore? and angela.... you said on the phone i guess we aren't doing anything today. i didn't know when i was leaving. i just knew it was suppose to be at 1. but that got delayed and aaron wanted to come over to say bye. thats it. i really wanted you to call me on sunday. i needed to talk to you. you are my best friend. and you know that. if there is something you are mad about and about me tell me. i want to know. but i wanted to tell you something important before everyone else found out cause joe is a blabber mouth and he knows. i am moving back to ohio. i am gonna live with joe and my mom. i wanted to tell you. angela call me this weekend. i am serious. even call me early in the morning but if you call me early in the morning call my house. i really need to talk to you."

To all my friends expecting to see me winter break I got some bad news for you all. I wont be able to come. The weather is bad and the streets are ice. I don't want anyone making a risk and driving in it. I really wish I could of came back and saw everyone. I really miss everyone a lot. But the weather isn't on my side and niether are the streets. It took me two hours of crying pretty much to make this decision last night. Hardest one to make too. But I don't want anyone one risking it or anything.I am sorry everyone. I don't know when i'll be back next. If my parents have their way then not for a long time. But if not then maybe this summer."

about 20 days until i fly to erie! yay. can't wait to be back there and be with my family. it is going to be awesome. and then i get to go to ohio and be with my friends! 

life is so difficult. it makes me sick sometimes. there are some people who have done nothing except try to make everyone else happy or done what they could to help and yet they are not happy themselves. then there are others that don't try to help others and just get whatever their hearts desire and they are happy. and then there are some people that just don't care. i want to be happy. its the only thing i ever wanted. i moved to florida to make my dad and step mom happy. i am always there when someone needs advice or someone to talk to or to just listen. and i try to cheer people up and always make sure they are alright. why can i do that for everyone else and not be happy myself? maybe i just wasn't ment to be. or maybe i am not looking hard enough? i dont know. i just hope someday i find my happyness. everyone deserves it."

"event","thanks becky for filling me in on everything. and for introducing me to laura. 

so i just met someone. her name is laura. we have a lot in commen. she is cool. the weird part is when i lived in ohio she lived on the street infront of me. but we never met. how weird is that? 

i got a letter today from angie! yay it made me so happy. and because of her i think i will be coming to ohio for a couple of days. as long as the weather is good. 

i am so tired. i think i am gonna go for now."

"event","okay... once again the STEELERS WON! they beat the shitty browns. 24 - 10. to all of the browns fans that are reading this who is the best now biotchs?! lol. sorry about that. but the steelers are now 8 - 1 and if new england loses tonight then we will be # 1! yay. go us. STEELERS KICK ASS!

anyways aside from that... parents suck. i hate them. i really do. especially mine. um... my grandparents go back to erie tomorrow. i don't want them to. i am gonna miss 'em. especially my grandma. but i will see them in a month a long with the rest of my family that i miss so much. 

school pretty much sucks. but its the only time of the day that i actually have a life. the part of the day at school i actually enjoy are lunch and chemistry. the rest i could do without. 

um... don't know if i am gonna go back to ohio at all during winter break. no one seems to talk to me or return any phone calls or letters. so i don't know if i have anything to go back to. i miss everyone like hell but i am not sure anyone misses me or even notices i am not there. so i don't know. plus i think everyone is too busy with their own lifes and stuff like that. so i don't want to be in the way or anything. 

can't go back up north for summer vacation this year. which pisses me off majorly. i might be able to go to erie for a week or two. but not ohio. so if i dont go back to ohio winter break it wont be until i graduate that i will be back there. which i graduate may of 2006. not that far way! i can't wait to graduate. florida sucks and i want out. i hate this place and always will. and i don't like my parents! i want to go up north. where i belong and fit in. i miss it all!"

been really really bored. there is nothing to do when i don't have school. i really need a life. or a job. both would work for me. fa la la la la la la la la. i am so freaken bored. this really really sucks. this week has been pretty boring. everyone at school has been talking about the stupid homecoming that sucked. have to write a position paper for history comparing and contrasting the south slavery to the northern factory workers. shouldn't be too hard. but the bad part is we have to read them to the class. which is my weak spot. i hate talking infornt of groups of people. i am gonna be messing it up so badly. it sucks. hm... nothing more happening. i love having my grandparents down here. i like being around them. i would rather be around them then my parents. i can't wait for winter break. just to get away from them and florida. i don't know if i am gonna go to ohio. no one really talks to me any more. and when i call people no one is home and no one returns my messages. what's the point.  i think i am losing everything. i am starting to believe the ""once you leave you can't go back."" i don't know what to do."

~okay i was sick from monday until yesterday. 
*i lost my voice and am stuck with a really annoying caugh that hurts my lungs. 
*i got my ride to homecoming. 
*i got my dress for homecoming
*my grandparents are down here visiting and can't believe i am going to homecoming.
*um... i had two major major test in chemistry. we had to memorize 53 ions and their symbols. and well i *suck completely at memorizings. but some how... on the one where we had to go from symbols and write the *name i got a 97 on and today we had to go from name to symbol some how i got a 108. 
*lately the temp has been about 86-88 but today it is only 75. which is actually really nice. 
*i got attacked with a pink carnation at lunch. 
*it was spirit week this week. and yesterday i showed my school spirit and participated in clash day. which is also known as wacky day. i went all out with that. when i get my flim developed i will post a picture. i am sure all of you will find it extremly funny. everyone else did. 
~tomorrow is homecoming... its weird that i am actually a little excited about goings.... i don't know why either. 
~it's almost winter break... which means that i get to go to Erie, PA and to Ohio for a couple of days! yay... i can't wait to see everyone. and for those of you who don't like my hair cut... don't worry it is growing back pretty quick. 
~Dec. 4th i am taking the SAT... which scares me. so that should be interesting. 

that's about all...
um... i want to get a new belly ring. i am tired of the ones i got. lol. i only have 3. i need more. lol. hm... i can't wait until April 7! its my 16th bday! i already took and passed my driving test. i just gotta turn 16. lol. i can't wait until winter break. i miss my family and friends so freaken much. i am so excited to be going back again.

here is a shocker to some people... even to myself.... i am going to go to Cypress Lake High School's homecoming. Sam + Homecoming = nothing. its weird. i figured why not go. its going to be at Teco Ariena cause the hurricane's stole our gym. the theme is Las Vegas. my friends told me it would be worth it. so it better be. i am actually looking forward to it in a way. a night out. maybe i will start to have a life. who knows. my parents don't know i am going. and i am gonna keep it that way to. i am staying over a friends house and borrowing one of her dresses. we got it planned out.

i still need a job. i need to be working and have something to do. other than rollerblade, draw, work out, talk online, do homework and play video games. i need a life. tomorrow i am gonna go to a Youth in Government meeting. its a club that writes bills and in Febuary goes to the capital and tries to get 'em passed. i figured i'd check it out. maybe it'd be fun."

i get to first period. i still have egg in my hair and on my sweeter. everyone is asking what happened so i told my story. then we got our quarter finals back. i new i failed so i didn't bother to look at it. but i still have a b in the class.

next bad part of the day... lunch... my apple juice spilt all over me. so i no longer had only egg on me. but i had apple juice as well. i just wanted to go home even more than. then we had a suprise test in chem. we had to write the periodic table in electron complete configuration. it actually wasn't hard. then the bell rang. time to go home and get the shower i wanted all day.

since my shower i really haven't done nothing besides wash my nasty egg and apple juice cloths. and sit online. pretty boring. veronica is the only one on. where is everyone else?"

"event","i don't know what to do about winter break. i want to come back to ohio. and hang out and see everyone and just have fun. but i am not sure if anyone wants me to, no one even talks to me or returns my calls or calls me. everyone knows the cell number, i have it every weekend as long as my dad is working even if he isn't i still have it cause i am normally with him. and its a local number for everyone. not even my best friends talk to me. i keep thinking that they are just busy with school and other things. i hope that is it. i dont want it to be anything else. i don't know. i wish someone would talk to me. life would be so much easier if i could just go back and never of moved. but i can't. and now i am losing or have already lost everything i once had, my dog, my friends, my life. this all sucks more than anything else. more then most people can understand.  i hate this so much. i want to go back. i want my life back. i want my friends back. i want everything back. what hurts more is that people who haven't even met me talk to me but my friends that i have known for like ever don't even talk to me."

"event","i dont know.. lately i have felt like i dont have a place any more. i use to have a place inside my group. i don't think i do any more. no one talks to me any more. besides a couple of people every now and then. my best friends don't even talk to me that much. i feel like i dont belong any were. it sucks. i sit in my room and look around. i just see pictures of old memories and friends. and my old group. i thought i was still apart of it. but i guess i was wrong. i never know what is going on. unless i can find out from everyone's xanga. i want to come back winter break for a couple of days. but i am just not sure that there is anything to come back to. i love and care about everyone so much and i miss everyone like crazy. but i think i am forgotten. i may be wrong... but when no one ims you or calls you and you don't know what's going on with anyone. and when you try to have a convo with someone they only thing you get out of them is hey and what's up. i have had a conversation with someone i dont know at all online and we talked for at least an hour. yet the people i have known for what feels like forever can't have a conversation for 5 minutes. right now i am sitting here crying because i feel like i have lost everyone i really care about."

"event","Missing.. By: Sam Chiaramonte(that's me!)

I miss it once. 
I miss it twice. 
I miss everything I had at one point. 
Everything that I worked for. 
Everything that I had.
It's all gone. 
But I want it all back. 
Everything that ment something to me is fading away. 
I want it all to be clear again. 
Everything that I had, 
everything that I wanted, 
it is all disappearing. 
I want to go back. 
Yet I can't. 
Not right now,
But not forever, 
just for a little while. 
Someday I'll be back. 
But will everything be the way I left it?

Gone... By: Sam Chiaramonte(that's me!)

The world keeps turning,
But I'm not moving. 
Everything is passing by. 
Not letting me catch up.
I'm being left behind,
Left alone in the dark.
With no one to lend a hand.
Or show me a light.
To get me out of a hole 6 feet under.
I can't find my way out of a hole so deep.
I am leaving.
I am disappearing.
It's like I am already gone.
Just fill in the hole.
And leave me there to be alone. 

Mistake... By: Sam Chiaramonte(that's me!)

I made a mistake that I can't take back,
There's been more than one to take back,
More than one in my life.
One big mistake is my life.
But you can't change a mistakes that has been made.
You have to work with them to make them better.
But they can never be good.
Then what do you do?
Is there anyway to fix a mistake as big as mine?
Anyway to be happy when you don't know what that is?
How can you be happy when something is missing inside?
What if the puzzle pieces don't fit?
The world has given up on me.
It's no longer spinning with me but with out, 
The door doesn't have a key.
So I am left out.
Where do I belong?
Not here nor there,
Everyone makes mistakes,
What do you do when you are one of them?
Sometimes you just want to cry and make yourself a lake,
Sometimes you need a hand but no one is there,
Someone please help me,
Lead me in the right direction,
Away from all the mistakes that have been made,
And I have been blamed.
The mistakes need to be taken away.
Be gone for good.

Care... By: Sam Chiaramonte(that's me!)

I take a look around,
Looking for someone who cares,
I find no one there.
I go online looking for someone who cares,
And no one is there.
So where are the ones who care?
I can't find them. 
I know there has to be someone.
But where?
Before when I needed someone they were always there.
Now they are never there.
Am I really here?
Do I exist any more?
Why am I always the one looking for someone to care?
Why can't they find me?
I just want someone to care about me.
Others wise I don't have a reason to be here.
If no one cares,
And no one can help.
Then why am i here?
Just to suffer,
I need someone to care,
And find me a way out of this."

"event","last night i couldn't sleep. okay life has just sucked and wont stop. its annoying as hell. i mean okay i guess i was like 11 or 12 when i first found out that i hated life so much because i had depression. but we never really did anything about it. i just continued to put on a fake happy face for everyone. it got harder over the years. then last december for the first time i didn't hate life but it still sucked. but there were small things that i enjoyed. then i moved. my life turned to a burning hell. and that's where i am at today. but this time i have made some friends and the school doesn't suck ass. well my parents decided they wanted to move to New Port Richey. it's up by tampa. i tried to act excited and happy. didn't work to well. i told my dad today that he can't keep moving me around and expecting me to leave everything behind. he is just making my life just that much difficult. so he said that he doesn't want to move either but its a good opperatunity. but he doesnn't want to do it if it is gonna effect me again like it did last january. so hopefully we don't move.

and my dad decided that he is gonna help me as much as possible to go to college. which shoocked the hell out of me. i never expected that ever. last time we talked about college it was me paying for it. now he wants me to pay the minimum and not worry about the cost but to go to a college that is good for me and that i want to go to. first thought that came to me ""who are you and what the hell have you done with my dad"" okay one me and my dad haven't had a convosation without us ending up fighting and me locking him out of my room in god knows how long. second when the hell did my dad decided to start helping me? this is not like my dad at all. so it's really weird. oh and i was gonna get a laptop. but he wants me to wait until after i get a car and then he'll help me get an even nicer one. i was thinking ""are you feeling alright"" okay no one in my family had ever helped me really in life. especially my dad. maybe he feels bad for never being there. ya know my dad just figured out not to long ago that i am a tom boy. and he just remembered in like february that i have extremly bad depression. so it's weird for my dad to try to help me for once."

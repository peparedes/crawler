Hmm my EVERY fucking day life :)

Gym
School 
Work

OR

Gym 
School
Babysitting

That is my routine for the week

Weekends:
Try to relax but usually busy

mmm pudding.

NO MORE FUCKING PUDDING. 

I need to go on a minimal sugar intake diet..
I drink coffee usually once a day. 
I want to not feel shitty.

I want to not be so stressed too.. I want to move out of my house.. I hate bills and overall I just hate money.

Maybe I will be going to Aulstralia with Chelsey.. something new and I have always wanted to go there.. 

Well my eyes burn probably because I barely sleep..

I want warm weather I am sick of this winter business!"

I am still sick but I am feeling better.. besides my stuffed up nose and cough.. I just need to sleep and rest even though I am going to be working so much and not doing a lot of that probably.. but call me if you are home.. I know Katie is and Emily and Heather.. and Jill will be around and possibly Kim and stuff.. 

I am babysitting right now.. I am so bored.. I was so tired all day.. I need to sleep.. I dont sleep.. we know this.. 

I hate working I really do.. and I am so sick of it and it wears me out.. this week of school was so busy and so much work but of course it was with it being the week before spring break.. but now I am on break and I should be relaxing and no I am not really going anywhere I dont think but it would be nice to.. or even if I am not going anywhere relaxing and resting is good and will help my cold go away Im sure.. I have only been babysitting all day yesterday and today and working tomorrow and babysitting and working Sunday and babysitting Monday and working Tuesday and babysitting Wednesday and Thursday and then MAYBE FRIDAY I WONT HAVE TO BUT I DOUBT IT HIGHLY.. and then I am working on Saturday and most likely Sunday and then I go back to school. So I love it!! I guess it wasnt meant for me to relax.. if it ever is..

I want to go home and sleep in my bed even though my alarm is going to go off early and I am going to want to kill.. and I have to open tomorow damnit.. 

I am going to go..

Today I went to work after not sleeping well.. then I did some stuff then went to my grandpa's grave for the first time since the last time I was there.. and that was the day of his funeral.. and like I thought I would.. I cried.. I miss him so much.. so much.. all I want to do is sit down and have another grandpa talk with him and have him tell me jokes that make me laugh and then him to tell me that he loves me.. AUGH I hate it.. ok I am done writing that stuff.. but yeah so I went there then I went to see my grandma and I stayed over for a while and we had supper together and talked and stuff.. I havent seen her in a while too.. blah.. 

My grandma gave me some pictures back of me and grandpa that she had we used in a collage.. I fucking miss him augh I cant take it.. I hate it so much.. but what can I do.. NOTHING!! There is no one I miss more than him.. and it sucks when sometimes I think yeah I wonder what grandpa will say about this.. but I cant talk to him about it.. he was so young.. I dont understand why.. but I will accept I guess.. 

I am over tired I think and being too emotional right now possibly so I wont be.. 

I am happy Kelly has a better chance of staying here.. 
I am happy I dont have to get up early to go to work.. I have to work at 2 then I think I am hanging out with my friend Abbie..

But I should go and do some work.. a lot to do.. 

I am going to go..

I havent even been to class in like two weeks that is bad.. but I was sick and then last Sunday my Grandpa died.. it has been really hard.. I had never went to a wake or a funeral before.. I love my grandpa so much he is one of the best people I know and the best grandpa I could have asked for.. I am very sad he died but happy for him too because he is in a better place out of pain now and he is not suffering like he was in the hospital.. he hated being there.. I read at his funeral.. my Grandma asked me too and it made her very happy and I did it for him too and the rest of my family because they wanted me to.. it was hard but I did it.. I didnt have to read a lot so that is good because I would have cried up there because I was balling my eyes out before I went up.. I didnt know I was going up right then.. My cousin Kim read too and Bryan.. i think Bryan had the hardest one.. he read the remembrance and a lot of us helped to right it and it was so good and I dunno if I would have been able to read it.. but he doesnt want us to be sad and I will cherish all the times I had with him.. and not forget what he taught me.. I love you Grandpa.. and I wrote him a letter too and put it in his jacket.. my cousin Jess did too.. and my cousin Jackie put a picture of her kids there.. everyone is being strong and it is hard.. and it is going to be very different when Christmas comes.. and Thanksgiving soon.. my grandma wants to just cancel them.. I dont blame her it is sad and hard.. but I dunno I am sure she is very overwhelmed right now.. we always go over her house for that.. and now I dunno.. my grandpa was so young too but he was so sick.. I didnt expect it and I dont even know if it has fully hit me.. and I think it is because I just couldnt even believe it at first and like didnt beleive it.. it all happened so fast and he was 65.. he was so healthy going for walks every day.. long ones too.. he loved walking.. 

I was at work and I was getting out at 2 and going to see him.. well my mom came in at 1 and was like we have to go grandpa is not doing good.. he had been sleeping all week on a respirator.. they kept sedating him.. and then I left work and my mom told me he wasnt going to make it.. his body was shutting down on him.. he told us he didnt want to be on life support.. so we all went there and it was very hard.. I held his hand.. I wonder if he knew we were all there.. I kind of think he did.. I cried so much.. then the priest came.. Father Roger.. and went in with my dad, uncle, aunt, and grandma.. and then he died after they took the respirator out not very short after.. he was really sick.. so many people went to his wake.. people my grandma didnt even know.. everyone loved him and knew him.. he touched so many people.. even some lady went he met walking.. 

My Papa who is my mom's dad is not doing very well.. he is the one on oxygen tanks.. he has emphazema.. it just all sucks.. he needs to go to the doctors but he wont.. even his mom is still alive, my great grandma.. she is like 93.. 

I love my family so much.. 

But.. I dunno anyways..

Last night I went to Uno's with 11 people.. I dont feel like writting everyones name but it was fun and it was fun to all hang out again I missed everyone.. a lot were home this weekend from school..

I am going to go..

"event","The rain stopped finally.. it rained for like a week and a half.. 

I went to see Katie yesterday with Steph who came home this weekend.. it was cool.. she slept here Thursday and stuff.. so then we went to see KT yesterday in Boston and got soaked in the rain and then it stopped raining later.. then last night I was begged to go to the movies.. we saw Waiting.. it was good and funny.. go see it..

And.. today I am going to Fright Fest with Alex.. and I am glad it is not raining..

My parents are being assholes so basically I am not going home any more if I have to deal with that kind of shit everytime.. and I am not picking up my phone when they call.. fuck that..

I brought Stephanie to Victory yesterday.. she has not been home.. I had to.. she was like what.. like I was.. I walked in and freaked out.. she freaked out.. but it is so different in there.. I saw Chuck there.. then Sean.. and then Chris.. it was always a social event to just go in and buy one thing there but everyone is gone at school but some are still there..

My car likes to be wet in the rain like inside so I have to find out why and fix it.. that gets me mad..

I had such a bad day at work the other night.. I got to work.. me and Adam were mad because it just sucked.. I dropped a fucking spagetti sauce jar.. it broke.. I was covered in it.. I am glad everyone laughed and Adam thought it was so funny.. I was so mad.. then I left work.. my car was all wet but I got to work and saw that.. I set my car alarm off and didnt know how to shut it off.. my grandpa was doing bad.. and I was all upset.. and so upset.. but then I got flowers.. :o) and then went to the movies and the movie was good :o) We saw The Corpse Bride.. 

I should go do work before I leave later..

I am going to go..

I love you guys..

School is ok here.. I like my friends here.. I miss you guys though..

Next week I get my new car!! Kim and I will have twin cars.. haha that is ok..

I don't know they are a little different..

I miss you guys!!

Last night was fun.. there is like nothing to do so we decided to go for a ghost hunt or something.. Kelly and I got people and so many came.. it was not as good as we thought or as scary.. but that is ok.. something to do.. it was funny.. 

Then we were kind of going back inside and Alex came over and we hung out.. Then Kelly and I walked around because we were so awake at like 2:30 in the morning.. we are always like bed early but we don't.. that is ok.. tomorrow is Friday even though today feels like it..

I think I have a cold.. my throat hurts.. but I think I am feeling better.. I have a lot of work to do over the weekend.. I had more work to do this week.. so last night it was cool that I didn't have more to do because I did it.. 

I am going to go..

I have a big room that was a tripple and now it is a double.. I met my roommate her name is Kelly she seems nice.. yeah I know last minute and I got a big room and better desks and stuff.. yeah I dunno.. my parents went to orientation and then were like do you want to live on campus.. I think they saw how it wasnt a big deal.. I am still close to home and that sucks because I still want to go to Lasell.. or maybe transfer somewhere.. but I told my Dad I would go there with an open mind and try to like it as much as I can and maybe I will like it.. it is cool that I can live on campus now though.. because my mom was laying down the curfew rules and I was not liking them and now I don't have to sleep on Heather's floor or air mattress haha.. but we are in the same building and that is cool.. so we will see how this school is.. I dunno I got my classes.. I have to buy books for them still.. I want my campus to have wireless and it doesnt.. so it sucks.. and stuff but I dunno I am going to try to go there with an open mind and like it..

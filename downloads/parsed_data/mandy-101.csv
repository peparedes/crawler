Someone has been messing with my LJ, changing the password etc... I have an idea of who it may be but I'm not gonna say for sure, so if you see any weird goin ons with my LJ it may not be me... and whoever is messing w/ my LJ has the email treillis@gmail.com (I think that's it, well the Treillis part is right) So, if anyone finds this name to be fimilar please tell me :) Thanks

Well, I'll be the little ray of sunshine on this day...

Apparently lots of people hate Valentine's day, and that's cool, but I like it, I think it's nice. Yeah, so, I don't have anyone but I still have freinds and family and isn't there love there too? I dunno, but I think that's a reason to be happy... but oh well, I'm not gonna let one simple day get me down. Sure it would be nicer to have someone but I'm quite content on where I am :) So, Happy Valentine's Day to you all, weather you like it or not...


Later Dayz,
Mandy

My weekend was pretty good, Friday night I went to Stavanger in the blizzard and jumped through a lot of snow drifts and then I spent the reast of the night dancing w/ Elmy, Sacha, Lauren, Robyn and Katherine... It was halirous and so fun. Then Saturday me and Brad went to the mall, and we got Brad a new outfit :) And then Saturday night was drinkin and lip sync, good times, sore throat no drunk. And yesterday Elmy, Sacha and Katherine came to my house for turkey dinner good times!

Last night sucked. Oh well, we can't have it all now can we?

Today was good, even tho I was super tired! Kris came over from like 1:30 to 3:10 and we chatted it was great to have her over, I haven't hung with her in a while... :) And then I spent the rest of the day studying for Psych. (bleh) Oh well, all I have tomorrow is that mid-term and then going to the gym w/ Sacha!! I need to go to the gym, it feels so good... and maybe we can play badminton...

And YAY FOR MID-TERM BREAK IN T-MINUS 4 DAYS AND COUNTING!!!! :P


Later Dayz,
Mandy"

Yesterday was crappy, but... life goes on.After supper I went to games night and played crib with Billy and we got second place, we skunked two teams and the other only got 92, and the final game we only got passed the skunk line... :P Last night I went to the Hockey Game, Hatcher aganist Barnes/Rothmeir... WE WON!! Haha, it was a great game lots of good hits and goals!

Today was good I had class, the I ate lunch w/ Jen then Claralee picked me up and we went to the mall where I had my second lunch and we then went to Wal-Mart. I like hanging with Claralee she's so cool to talk to.

Well...

Just wasting time before class... this English class at 11 will be the first English class I had since last Friday, and I like my English class too ugh... and then I have Bio, like ""Gag me with a spoon"" it's SO BORING!!!

My classes are goin alright so far but I should study a lot more then what I am, seems I just can't get my mind on it... I need to focus but my head is in the clouds...

My week started out crappy but it's gettin better, Wednesday I had my first 2 classes then English and Bio were cancelled and yesterday Math and Psyc were cancelled!! Wahoo! But school opened just in time for my Bio Lab, which is great because if we never had it yesterday we would have to make it up on Saturday (gross) so Thankfully we had it on time :)

This weekend someone better get ready for the chaos I'm gonna cause... yeah, I'm gonna be STUDYING all weekend, at home so, you better watch out. *cough* Actually this weekend will be nice and relaxing, something I need...

Saturday I did nothing, I go up late, ate, got ready for the Hockey game, went, had a good time, and came home. Watched some popular and went to bed. Wild... I know.

I was just reading my cousin's web site and she had this quote on it and I thought it was awesome and everyone should read it...


May you always have work for your hands to do.
May your pockets hold always a coin or two.
May the sun shine bright on your windowpane.
May the rainbow be certain to follow each rain.
May the hand of a friend always be near you.
And may God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.

Then I come inside where there's a message left on my MSN from Claralee (my cousin) to call her. She had a virus, and I went over to see what I could do to help... I couldn't do anything, I got part of it deleted but it's a virus that affects more that one file and I couldn't find the other files... so she is going to get a friend of her's to look at it... anywayz nuff rambling bout that.

Okay... where do I begin? I think I'll start Dec.30.

Dec. 30, I get up 8:00am and get ready to go to Markland and that area. I get to the Irving at about 1:30 where Joey comes and picks me up and gives me a tour of the area. Then we go back to his place and hang out and get ready for the Band Show. Then we go to Mitchel's then we went and picked Topher up and I meet Don (Pokit Rockit's gutairest sp??) And we head to Shearstown (I think) to the Band Show where we meet up with Kris and Mitchel. Then we enjoy the show (pics in ""My Space"") Even tho I got a headache. Anywayz, after the show we all went to McDonald's and then the guys drop me and Kris off at her house.

Next Day Me and Kris spend hours playing with my camera. Then we watch Chicago then played Phase Ten with her family (I sucked at it) And then we ate supper and got ready for New Years. Then Mitchel calls and tells us New Years location was changed from Topher's to the Loft so me and Kris had to get ready all over again. haha.

That night we go to the loft (no comment on the loft) Then we go to Joey's for a bit, then we went to the lake and set off fireworks, (scary and bad idea) We almost get hit by one and then another set anded in the trees. But I suppose that's what you get for getting a bunch of drunk guys settin them off... haha. Then we went to Topher's to dance and hang out.

Next moring I hang with Kris, watch some Friends and then get ready and I go to Joey's forsupper and sleep over the night. We have supper at Joey's aunt's where they keep giving me Orange Creamcicles and I get a little buzzed and pick on Joey for the night while his mom takes a 100 pics of me but I like getting pic takin so it's all good. Then after we go back to Joey's and watch Batman and Aladdin and some comics.

Today I get up get ready and go home with Joey and his parents then I went to Joey's for supper and hang out and now here I am!!

That's it... i think...

Christmas eve, we did the regular cooking,wrapping (I did the MOST wrapping over the xmas season) and then we all got ready and went to Obie's christining. It was nice and I had to read which I was kinda nervous for but it turned out good.

THEN, came the party at my place, LOTS of people and good times, drinkin, food, laughs, singing, family and more. I had an awesome time. Then we went down to Newtown til like 3:30am.

Christmas morning I woke up at 6 and waited for my cousin Ness to call, which happened at 7:00. I woke up and while looking out my window for my family to come to my house to open gifts (we had a gross amount of gifts) My mom metioned Ashley and I bawled... it was very unexpected on my be half.

But for Christmas I got a digital camera, clothes, bullitin board, photo frame, 2 games and more... anywayz, I gtg.

I brought Honey over to Joey's it was a good meeting. While I was there we watched the Punisher, took Honey for a walk where I met a few of Joey's friends and his cousin, we also watched Dane Cook.

So, I wake up today at 9:30... oh my... then my Aunt Shelia, Uncle Kev, Claralee, Obie, Ashley and Mom all go to Stavanger and shop have luch(which felt like supper) So, here I am in Wal-Mart convinced it's like 8:30 at night, but in reality it's only 1:00!!! Then we go home and Uncle Kev wants me to take him to the mall cuz he doesn't like driving out here, so we go to the mall and shop and browse around.

I get home, at 5:30 or so, make a CD for Aunt Shelia after many attempts and go pick up some pizza from Pizza Delight. And then I babysit Obie for 2 hours which he cried through, I hate when babies cry cuz you don't know why they're upset. Then I wrap some presents for people, and after I do odds and ends I end up here now writing this.

But on a brighter note I have 3 new pairs of pants!! :P

Tomorrow is a study day for lingustics... I can't wait til I'm done that boring crap!! And also it is my LAST exam so, that's always a bright note... Everyone else has been done for a while and are gone home.

Friday, is exam, and hanging with Joey and HOPEFULLY *crosses fingers* I can bring Honey over, and the Saturday is the semi-formal!!!! YAY!

Also, today I found out 100% I can go to Topher's for New Years!!! YAY! (now... all I need is a ride...)

I had my French exam and it went well! Yay! Thanks Ryan for keeping me sane! (Remember une robe, not une jupe!! haha)

Well, my last exam is Friday and I have the courde passed already! YAY! I'm so happy.

Last night while studying I drank 2 pepsi's, a juice box and ate a piece of cake, and I was the most hyper... it was bad I was shaking.

And Today I got to see Sandra at Bree's. Joey, Bree, Tim, Brendon were also there, then after Bree's I went to Joey's for little while then I came home and had McDonald's. And now here I am...


Later Dayz,

I started decorating my house today, me and mom got into it as usual, she hates my decorating and I hate hers... it's a beautiful relationship me and my mom have, we are so much alike we can't get along yet I loves her and want to impress her all the time.. weird.

It's sad, my exam is tomorrow, and yet I still procrastinate... the only exam I'm worried about is Englsih which is on Thursday...and I haven't even opened a book for that one... I'm so lazy. I just can't get focused... so... here I am proscastinating... as usual.

I'm so excited for rez, everyone says I will like it, and I hope they're right, I love it no curfew no parents, I'm so FREE!!! I can't wait! I wanna be there now, but really I only need to wait one month.

The snow is here, I'm happy everyone else in my family is rotted and Ashley keeps blaming me it's here... but oh well, I like it.

I want my exams over so bad... mine are so spread out, I have Math Tomorrow, Englsih Thursday, Psyc. Monday, French Tuesday and Ling Friday... then it's OVER!!!

Hopefully this New Years I can go to Kris's! It would be awesome!!! I cannot wait! I hope I can get a ride, but its a very good chance I can. Then I can see everyone and see where they're from that'd be neat! haha, neat what a great word, but nothing beats wiggle. Sorry, got side tracked...

Since everyone else seems to be counting down to something so will I... 19 dayz til Christmas!!!!

And I want everyone to write their fav Christmas Song in my comments, so I can see if I'm forgetting any. Actually people can write as many songs as they like, write who it's by too, if you can remember :)

So, I decided I don't want to become a speech pathologist anymore... I hate lingustics... it's boring, it's an aquired taste and i just don't have it. I am doing well in the course, I have an A, but it's just a snooze fest. So, I decided to do Psyc. through the Sciences and become a Psycoligist. Sounds good... to me anywayz, but thankfully this first year has not gone to waste cuz all my courses are good for my degree.

Today, I went to class as usual, and had the listening section to my French Exam, and then my Prof gave us this heart felt good-bye and like made me wanna cry, haha! And since I got out early I caught up with Bree and Joey, then Keith at the UC and chatted with them a while. And before classes today I ran into Janelle Cooper and talked to her a while, i haven't seen her since she left for school.

Then I went to Claralee's for supper, and before supper I got to feed Obie, it was the first time I ever fed a baby and I did it all on my own, I'm so proud. :) (I know I'm a loser) Then Jason's brother Cory came in and him and Ashley chatted about ski-doo's. Then me and Ashley went home... and now here I am!

And this weekend is Joey's family's dinner thingy (food? yes!) And tomorrow night is...... TWISTER!!!! I'm excited and I'm sleeping over kris's.... YAY!!! I love weekends!!!

I think everyone who comments on my LJ today should leave me a question, and I'll answer!! Just give me something to do, and it'll be fun!

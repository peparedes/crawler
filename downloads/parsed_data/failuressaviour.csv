"event","xxxxxxxxxxxx wow today has been way fucked up i had the hugest fight possible with my parents my mum ""accidently"" scratched me in a violent way, and my dad lost it completely.... they wanted me out... and they said so.... so i complyed,.... and they felt bad and oh man what a day so emotional so many tears so much fighting and im so stressed.
its just to much to deal with. i love my parent but they are driving me away, oh yeah so tomorro is my driving test, so i know everyone is like big deal, and they have their license already, but my happiness relies on getting this and im so scared i wont...
im a stress head and react very badly when put under any type of pressure,
so everyone cross ur fingers for me.
i was supposed to show up for a photo shoot today and didnt make it due to certain  um probs with parentals.
um yeah so this day has been crazy, trying to get a health care card at the lat minute so rego and stuff for my car wont cost ridiculous amounts.
and all these other missions i was on today, but it has luckily all fallen together at the end of the day and now im exhausted. zzzzzzzz
um so tomorro i have a very corporate meeting at my agency they want me to do promo for coca cola, which is really big news for me so im really excited, but i need to buy some smart stuff to wear,
also, tomorro night i am hosting at the royal childrens hospital fundraiser charity ball, which is something i have been asked to do by my agency, i dont get paid for it but its something thats  shoulkd be fun i have to report there at 6.30 where they do my hair and makeup then i change into a black ballgown and help host the event, it should be fun and all goes towards a great cause.
so i feel like im doing something good + i LOVE dressing up ! hehe!
um yeh so thats about it, im hoping life starts to look  up and that tomorro i get this liscence because i have to be places tomorro!
yay to my parents for buying me a car,
if only we could be nice to each other.,....

"event","why do they make it so hard to get your liscence?
i put it offf for so long after travelling,
and now ayear after turning eighteen i need my liscence,
and.... im a baaad driver!
well i thought i was ok but, put under the nerves of a pretend driving test, i failed miserably, im telllng you its just the hills in dromana!!!
haha, this time next week is the big day, but im so nervous i dont think im going to get it, oh well. if all else fails ican just get auto... haha. i suck.
today is one of my first days off working for about three weeks and im enjoying it muchly...
i slept in till 2pm, and then got up, had two bowls, of nutra grain, followed by a huge serving of pasta el BORRO, (pasta with minimal cheese and butter)
haha, i was hungry!
and now me and my dog are just kickin it at home.
and now i realise that days off are kind of boring.
i spent the weekend staying at sammis and sharnas, it was fun, went to a 21st,
i knew noone and didnt drink so i had a not so fun night, but then i went to switch and it got better, i guess.

all of my friends are going through so much heartache over boys and i so much want to tell them that it stops hurting eventually,
but it doesnt, im sorry
even when its been a long time it still hurts when you see them
and you never stop missing them...
im sorry.
i wish i could tell you that it gets better, but i really dont think it does.
you just have to learn to deal with it,
and try to forget you miss them.
soorry again..

gus and cam came for movies sunday night.
a really funny night, im so glad stuff is cool again with those boys, 
they rock my world!
i wish a certain english idiot who i cant stand would stop coming in and hasseling me at work, i dont like him, he scares me!

yeah so any way
i hope everyone cheers up,"

"event","well i am so very lazy, i am so slack at updating this.
i have had another weird and wonderful and not so wonderful week.
who the hell created pigeon boy???
they must be stupid...
my weekend consisted of doing nothing no switch, no gigs, no friends, noithing....
just bed and sleep and it was oh so good,
im in the middle of creating cams angel and it will be a masterpiece.
i hid myself in my room on the weekend and believed i could create an angel for cam........ and i will
i just need more paint......
a minor setback
i worked all week, doing promo for some makeup, it was ok.
i worked at platos, also ok..... but we need to get more cds in.
i worked....
and worked.......
i need sleepness.
i am so lucky, my parents are buying me a car i should have it next week. it isnt the oooober cool baby pink fb 60's holden station wagon that i dream about, it is also not the black shiny zephyr mark 3 that i would look oh so pimp in, but it is a car and its fairly new and nice if u like that sorta thing, so thanks mum and dad you guys really are so generous and awesome.. i never dreamed i would be this lucky.
heard i missed a good party friday or saturday night or something...hatin it
um yeah teges is moving to the city for two months, so i feel kinda sad bout it
this week has been kinda boring i guess
i kissed a boy last night and im not sure if i wanted to but oh well it happens,
he came for vids and i used to like him but got over it then i guess it just happened and oh weellll, its not the end of the world. right?

this week im hopingwill be more eventful, and i dont want cams angel to go unfinished like so many other things i start,
something exciting is hapening soon, i cant say what it is but it is really awesome, i guess its a form of time travel, but you will see..... or maybe u wont....so shhhh!



when will you realise that you are your own downfall....??"

im sick of being used
im sick of people who take things the wrong way and then get mad and block you
im sick of the fact that i sat all alone on my birthday and everyone was to busy to come and see me, even my best friends,and no one gave a fuck
im sick of people pretending to be someone they are not
im sick of people who judge people because they dont look like typical scene kids, (black hair)
im sick of pretending my life is peachy keen when it isnt
im sick of putting on a happy face and smiling even wen i want to fucking yell at the world
but im also sick of people who are so hardcore they cant be nice to their friends who are not so 'perfect'
and im sick of being nice to people who i dont really like,
im sick of the judgements people make based on looks

and im so so sorry for needing to be angry 
im so so sorry for being a fuck up
and i know i wont be as mad in the morning i just need sleep
im sorry
im sorry

"event","so the night was.......interesting i guess that would be the appropriate word....
by the time i got home from work i was running really late, cos i decided i wanted to make a whole new belt, which i did..aaaand it was good but by the time i got home me and teges were running rather late...
and by the time we picked up micci and lee and got to metro... saves the day had started.
and it was a weird night
a weird weird night
and weird things happened...
but...
what i can say is!
PROCRASTINATION IS THE DEVIL!
so i put off talking to this boy and stepped around the situation, and by the time i had the guts to go say hi to him, (which was about 3 hours after i actually saw him)
he was walking out the door cos he had to take his friends home!!!
so yeah..my bad,
but i visited him at work today and we might be meeting up tonight soooo,
yeah....i dont know why i think this will be any different to any other guy who has liked me then gotten over it...but oh well......faith people!!
but the whole night was strange in general,
i spent the whole night trying to avoid a certain two people who i really didnt want to see mackin on, but next to that i guess it was an ok night, i got nice and drunk and slept on the way home, and felt very awful this morning. but im so confused about a few small things...
a few events that changed my perception on certain matters, and a few mixed feelings about people, and im soooo confused about what is wrong and what is right,
and how i feel about some people that i thought were just friends..
anyway im out....

i covered miccis shift today at platos, it was such a boring day, but lee came and visited for hugs, and micci came in as i was finishing, so did dillon, but just to make out with the tortured souls toys!!, haha, im going to try get him a job there he would probly be much better with th metal section than me, as, i love my hardcore, but my metal doesnt really spread past meshuggah, soilwork,and bleeding through....limited, sad, but true.... oh well me and dill then did a savers/ army disposals mission, then i headed back with gus and cam to cams house to watch them pull the guts out of the interior of gus's car..... while i complained about everything i possibly could, then i headed home while the bois headed city way.

"event","so today was the most uneventful day of my life,
it began with gettin to the store and realising that the locks had been changed, and that i didnt have the new key yet... i was already really late and hesitant to call eric, as he is not the funnest person in the morning... but after wandering around and realising that a hot chocy wasnt going to solve anything, regardless of how many marshmallows in it , (regardless of what cam says), i ended up calling eric and having the stupid key dropped of to me.... th day proceeded to be boring and dead with a lack of any customers,
but it got better when cam and gus came for a visit, and gus bought a gummi lunch for two!
so we had a picnic in the front window consisting of mini gummi hamburgers, hotdogs cokes fries etc, so fun!!
and that was it the sales were bad and we need so many better cds, i possibly listened to glasseater three times over!! so sad....

and then i went to dons did the regular cleaning up started a new belt, and came home...on the bus.....
i hate the bus, i need a car.
and wen i got home i talked to sammy and soph and me and soph had a chill seesha, and that was it!!
my night is so boring...
but so much to look forwasrd to!!
SAVES THE DAY! on thursday, plus im supposed to be meeting a date at the concert so im kinda nervous.. weve talked a few times, but hes never seen me... so it should be interesting, he isnt my typical type soooo.... should be fun though

HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEEE!!!!!!!!

and i promise my journals will get more interesting, i just need something to happen first!"

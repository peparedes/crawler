"event","Well how long has it been since an update? WAAAAAY too long. I guess I just really haven't been doing anything. A whole bunch of us went over to the 80's club this past Saturday, and we have our weekly pub crawl. Those are always fun! Found me a boy, who's also fun. Had some really tripped out dreams, too, let me tell you. There was this one where I was an octopus girl and I could change at will from a girl, to an octopus, to a snail with a really far out shell. The guy I was seeing in girl form was a scientist and he finally figured it out and had to protect me from the evil government. Kinda like that movie Splash! with the mermaid, only octopi aren't as pretty. We heve better defenses, though, and way more legs. Legs are cool.

Ok, well I'm just going to leave it at that, for now. Maybe more after this week's pub crawl. It'll be like... the ongoing saga on an American with too much booze.

Later all."

"event","I'm horrid at journal keeping, I realize this. I TOLD you all before you make me get one but did you listen? Nooooo!

Did I say there was a petting zoo down there? NOOOOOOO

So what have I been up to... Getting into trouble with Jason, Cookie, and Alexander. Also getting into trouble with Leanna, Kalliope, and Eris. So... getting into a lot of trouble. We've been going to the pubs and hanging out and what not. I don't have a job, so that sucks, but I'm going to mow lawns or catsit or something for a little extra spending cash. Auntie gives me an allowance (how quaint!) but I drink too much. Hehehe. Coz it's LEGAL here.

I think I'm going to go into London for a few days, maybe this weekend. Cookie, Jason, and Eris are thinking on it, too. I love them. It's so much fun to walk around the streets of London with an artist (Jason's ALWAYS covered in paint.... or whatever his latest creation happens to be made of), a flamer (That would be Cooks, the gayest gay guy you ever did meet. He makes those Queer Eye for the Straight Guy dudes look... well, straight!) and our very own resident punk, Eris. We call her Punk Eris. Because we can. I think her hair and... gold and spiky this week? She makes me smile. Heeee.

Right. Well. This damn thing better update it's ass. Because I'm getting tired of it not working after I wrote long butt posts. Long butt posts. Funny.

Okie dokers, bye!

"event","Ok. So I tried this once and it deleted my entry. So now I'm mad at Livejournal.

BAD LIVEJOURNAL! NO COOKIE!

Ok. So that's not really the best first impression of me. Hi! I'm Jessie, oft called the Artful Dodger, and I finally got so annoyed with Jason for bugging me and got this thing. He wants me to put up the results for all the quizes he makes me do. Because he's a great big dork. Yes, you are. But he has an accent so it's all cool.

I don't have an accent. Well, I do, but it's not cool like his. I'm from the States, you see. I only moved to England a few years ago, but I like it a lot better. A LOT better. I try not to think about the US much anymore. I'm sad about a few friends I had to leave behind, but fr the most part, better. Better better better. 

Ok, I think that;s all I'll say for just now.

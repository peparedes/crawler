"event","Hey, Sorry I haven't been writing in forever. I got a little preoccupied!ok! So let me catch u up! I tried out for the school's softball team, but after being at tryouts everyday after school for 3 or 4 frikin weeks i got CUT! And the funny part is that the coach took some really awful people that just started playing softball. We have a very stupid coach. Something good came out of that, though. I get to go and work on the schools play Guys and Dolls Jr. I'm in the Mission Band and am the prop master. 
nothing much has gone on other than that. Last night, though about 20 people from the play all went on an after school fieldtrip with Mrs. Richardson and Mrs. Rhodes to Eastside Highschool to see them do their version of Guys and Dolls. We had sooo much fun! I rode with Mrs. Richardson, Ben Shuba, Zoe Sneed, and some 8th grade dude named Nick. oh, and of course Mrs. Richardson's daughter, Lauren. Before we went to the play, we went to fudruckers and ate and got milkshakes. It was a pretty good play, but ours will be better. On the way back, we had a chinese firedrill, thats where u get out of the car in the middle of the road and run aroud the car. Our teacher is soooo kool! then she took us home at about 11:15! so i spent the whole day at skool, pretty much. 15 hours at school, jeesh! Then i wanted to sleep late this morning, but did my dad want me 2, nooooo! So we fought, and i kicked him where u don't want to be kicked and eventually he poured a BIG bucket of cold water on me! So thats my day, so far. Later!"

My parents and I went looking for a desk today, we found one at office max for like $99, but they were sold out and they'll get more on Wednesdy. So, I hope to clean my dresser off by then and get my desk all situated by Thursady and be set. Oh my dad has to build me some sort of like shelf beside my desk for my piano keyboard to sit on and for my sewing machine b/c my sewing machine hooks up to my computer so I can embroider stuff.

"event","Well, if you're wondering about the title, Welcome to the start of the real me, it means that for now on I am getting my act together and being me, not someone else. I have been so many people I don't think I should go on doing that. From now on I am going to be me. I will be letting you in on what I do in my life to acheive being myself. Doing what I really want to do, and making the most of life. Well, enough of this stuff, it's Christmas!!!! Let me tell you what I got:
  - A new Gateway computer (better than my brothers haha!) with a MAG Innovision flat screen monitor. I don't have a printer yet because I wanted an all in one! (I actually got this like a month ago because we were out shopping and we saw this for a huge deal and bought it and I sort of begged my parents to let me have it early)
  - A Casio piano keyboard that is so frikin awesome!
  - BLACK Ohio state sweatshirt!!!
  - New black boots!
  - $50 from my wonderful grandpa that was also the one who got me the ohio state sweatshirt
  - Seven awesome LONG silver earrings that are just so freakin amazing
  - A great watch that came with like 5 other watch bands that you can easily switch around o and the bands have great colors and patterns!
  - Harry Potter and thePrisoner of Azkaban DVD
  - Mute for my French Horn
  - Huge Sassage (like foot long) that tastes wonderful Yummy!
  - Gloves
  - Candy
  - This purse that is in the shape and form of a pink corset! I only wish it was black!!
  - Wonderful smelling lotion!
  - This pink robe with butterflies on it with matching slippers (gonna take it back, i'll post what i get for it later!)
  - some sorta spinner toy
that's all except for my gift I haven't gotten from my grandma yet. I should get it in like a week!

So, I don't believe in Santa Clause because I stayed up once like in 3rd grade and found out. My parents still think I do or they want me to act like I still do until like I'm 18 or can drive, or something. If any little kids are reading this, and believe in Santa, then I hope you still do, what do I know, I am just one person, but don't forget that one person can make a difference! :) *deep thoughted* (new word, LOL Tiffany!!)
Well, I better go! Well, for now at least. Usually I would give you like a whole schedule thing but I have been typing all day and I want to go play on my brother's new XBOX LOL!

Audios!!! (Taking Spanish! LOL)
Ur little pen pal, Broken_Mind A.K.A Taylor"

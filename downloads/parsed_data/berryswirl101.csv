"event","<lj-cut text=""Get Yer AlcoHoroscopes Here""> ARIES
Drinking style
Impulsive Aries people like to party and sometimes don't know when to
call it a night. Their competitive streak makes them prone to
closing-time shot contests. They're sloppy, fun drunks, and they get
mighty flirty after a couple tipples. Getting Aries people drunk is a
good way to get what you want out of them, should other methods fail.
Aries can become bellicose when blotto, but they will assume that
whatever happened should be forgiven (if not forgotten) by sunrise. They
can be counted on to do the same for you -- so long as you haven't gone
and done anything really horrible to them last night, you sneaky
Gemini.

TAURUS
Drinking style
Taurus prefers to drink at a leisurely pace, aiming for a mellow glow
rather than a full-on zonk. Since a truly intoxicated Taurus is a
one-person stampede, the kind of bull-in-a-china-shop inebriate who
spills red wine on white carpets and tells fart jokes to employers, the
preference for wining and dining (or Bud and buddies) to body shots and
barfing is quite fortunate for the rest of us. This is not to say
that the Bull is by any means a teetotaler -- god, no. A squiffy Taurus
will get, er, gregarious (full of loudmouth soup, some would say) and is
extremely amusing to drag to a karaoke bar when intoxicated.

GEMINI
Drinking style
Geminis can drink without changing their behavior much -- they're so
naturally chatty and short-attention-spanned that it's just hard to tell
sometimes. They can amaze you by conversing with finesse and allusion,
then doing something to belie an extremely advanced state of
intoxication, like puking in your shoe. Geminis possess the magic
ability to flirt successfully (and uninfuriatingly, which is very
tricky) with several people at once. They like to order different
cocktails every round -- repetition is boring -- and may create a theme
(like yellow drinks: beer, sauvignon blanc and limoncello) for their own
amusement.

CANCER
Drinking style
Cancer is a comfort drinker -- and an extra wine with dinner or an
after-work beer or six can be extra comforting, can't it, Cancer
darling? Like fellow water signs Scorpio and Pisces, Crabs must guard
against lushery. Cancers are brilliant at ferreting out secret parties
and insinuating themselves on VIP lists -- and, in true Hollywood style,
Cancers are never really drunk; instead, they get ""tired and emotional""
(read: weepy when lubricated). But there's nothing better than swapping
stories (and spit) over a few bottles of inky red wine with your
favorite Cancer. Even your second-favorite Cancer will do. The sign also
rules the flavor vanilla, and you'd be adored if you served up a vanilla
vodka and soda.

LEO
Drinking style
Leo likes to drink and dance -- they're often fabulous dancers, and
usually pretty good drinkers as well, losing their commanding dignity
and turning kittenish. Of course, they're quite aware they're darling
Leos will be Leos, after all. They generally know their limit, probably
because they loathe losing self-control. When they get over-refreshed,
expect flirting to ensue -- and perhaps not with the one what brung
them. But Leo's not the type to break rules even when drunk, so just try
to ignore it (try harder, Cancer) and expect a sheepish (and hung over)
Lion to make it up to you the next day.

VIRGO
Drinking style
Cerebral Virgos are compelled to impose order onto their bender. Their
famously fussy quest for purity could lead to drinking less than other
signs, sure -- but it could also lead to drinking booze neat, to sucking
down organic wine or just to brand loyalty. They rarely get fully
shellacked -- but, oh, when they do! Virgo's controlled by the
intellect, but there's an unbridled beast lurking within, and they let
it loose when walloped. It's dead sexy (and surprisingly unsloppy). As
one Virgo friend used to declare, ""I'm going to drink myself into a low
level of intelligence tonight."" A toast to the subgenius IQ!

LIBRA
Drinking style
""I'm jusht a social drinker,"" slurs Libra, ""it's jusht that I'm so damn
social?"" Libra loves nothing more than to party, mingle and relate to
everyone. Whether dipped in favor of Good Libra (with Insta-Friend
device set to ""on"") or heavier on the Evil Libra side (they are little
instigators when bored), the Scales can really work a room. Charming as
they are, Libras are notoriously lacking in self-control, however, which
can get them into all sorts of trouble -- including wearing their wobbly
boots waaaay too early in the evening, flirting with their best friend's
beau or even blacking out the night's events entirely. Oops!

SCORPIO
Drinking style
Don't ever tell Scorpios they've had enough, for they'll smirk at you
and quietly but intentionally keep tippling till they're hog-whimpering
drunk, out of 100-proof spite. Scorpios like to drink, and screw you if
you have a problem with that. Most of them see the sauce as something to
savor in itself, and not as a personality-altering tool -- though if
depressed, self-loathing Scorps seek total obliteration. But generally,
they're fascinating drinking pals, brilliant conversationalists and
dizzying flirts. They also remember everything -- especially what you
did when you were blitzed. Only drink with a Scorpio who likes you.

SAGITTARIUS
Drinking style
In vino veritas -- and, for Sagittarius, in booze blurtiness: When
buttered, they'll spill all your secrets and many of their own.
Tactlessness aside, Sagittarius is just plain fun to drink with. This is
a sign of serious partying (what else would you expect from the sign of
Sinatra, Keith Richards, the Bush twins and Anna Nicole Smith?). They're
the people who chat up everyone in the room, then persuade the entire
crowd to travel somewhere else -- like a nightclub, or a playground, or
Cancun. Good-natured hijinks are sure to ensue (including a high
possibility of loopy groping; spontaneous Sag is a brilliant booty
call).

CAPRICORN
Drinking style
Capricorn is usually described as practical, steadfast, money-hungry
and status-thirsty -- no wonder they get left off the astrological
cocktail-party list. But this is the sign of David Bowie and Annie
Lennox, not to mention Elvis. Capricorn is the true rock star:
independent, powerful and seriously charismatic, not too eager to
please. And if they make money being themselves, who are you to quibble?
But just like most rock stars, they're either totally on or totally off,
and they generally need a little social lubricant to loosen up and enjoy
the after party, especially if they can hook up with a cute groupie.

AQUARIUS
Drinking style
Aquarius and drinking don't go together that well (except for water,
that is). They have an innate tendency toward know-it-allism, and if
they get an idea while sizzled, they're more stubborn than a stain or a
stone. If they're throwing a party or organizing an outing, however,
they're too preoccupied with their duties to get combative -- and they
make perfectly charming drunks in that case. Fortunately, they're
usually capital drink-nursers. They also make the best designated
drivers (if you can get them before they start raising their wrist):
Aquarius is fascinated by drunk people and capable of holding
interesting conversations with soused strangers while sober.

PISCES
Drinking style
If you're a Pisces, you've probably already heard that you share a sign
and an addictive personality -- with Liz Taylor, Liza Minelli and Kurt
Cobain. Not only do Pisces like to lose themselves in the dreamy,
out-there feeling that only hooch can give, but they build up a mighty
tolerance fast. Who needs an expensive date like that? On the other
hand, they're fabulously enchanting partners, whether in conversation or
in crime. With the right Pisces, you can start out sharing a pitcher of
margaritas and wind up in bed together for days. The phrase ""addictive
personality"" can be read two ways, you know.</lj-cut>"

How do I get roped into doing big ass projects at work that initially have nothing to do with me?

So he asks Nurse Mary Sunshine to gather the info and she completely panics and freaks out because 1.the computer scares her and 2.she has no idea how to figure out FVC<70% (which is really sad considering she is a nurse for a pulmonary practice.  Even I know how to do this).  I make a simple suggestion about running reports to eliminate patients, and end up having to do most of the reports myself.

Sunday's:  I was in NY waiting for Dave to come back from tour/rehab, whatever.  I decided to take a shower in public bus outside his apartment building and when he still hadn't shown up, walk down the street.  At the end of his street was a gigantic Sephora!  Being the cosmetics whore I am, I filled up a basket and was at the checkout when you-know-who shows up and puts his good arm around me because the other was in a sling.  He offered to pay for my warpaint and signed the credit slip as ""Fiona Gahan"" because he said my name was eaiser to write.

The show was good.  My friend Shelby works for Laura Mercier, so Steph and I got our makeovers done at their counter.  She wanted MAC, but I think there's only so many times in your life you can get a MAC makeover.  Anyhow, loved the MA, loved the makeover and was suckered into buying a bunch of product.  However, noone told me that Laura Mercier products are significantly more expensive than most department store products and I almost fainted at the total for 6 items.

Friday was the Bulls tip-off lunch.  My office sent 5 of us and I realized that since Michael Jordan left the Bulls, I have no idea who any of the players are.  Except for Scottie Pippen and that's just because...well...he's Scottie. Even uglier in person.  Whatever - got us out of the office for the day and a free $80 lunch.

Spent 10 hours finishing Ciara & Aidan's halloween costumes Saturday.  They're going to be Trinity & Neo and I must say the costumes came out pretty damn good.  Go me.  Pics to come soon.

Happy birthday tomorrow to Saggy Ass...I mean Simon Le Bon.  Thanks for scamming us once again with $60 tickets to a general admission concert.  This shit better be worth it.  I better be able to have a Simon and John Taylor sandwich for crissakes. 

I'll end this by publicly admitting that I'm addicted to I Love The 80's Strikes Back and I'd like to bear the children of Michael Ian Black and Hal Sparks. That is all."

"event","So Duran Duran has decided to further complicate their tour by introducing a <a href=""http://duranduranmusic.com/"">fan community</a> where for $35, membership gets you a whole myriad of Duran tour package info, entry into contests, and the coveted presale password. What the fuck? The ""member"" presale does me no good in Chicago as House of Blues is general admission (there goes the promise of seats in the first few rows) and if GA show members are given early access, the Duranies that have waited in line for 36 hours are sure to kick the crap out of us (you know how mean some of those Duranie chicks can be ).  The rest of the good stuff offered by membership ""have additional costs"".  Greedy bastards.  Though, despite all this, I will be attending both shows.  I'm a sucker.  

I'll hand it to those Duran boys.  They know how to stir up some controversy.  The DD message boards are muy entertaining now. MEOW!

In closing, I find comfort in knowing down deep in my heart that there is a special hell for annoying Cubs fans and those 2 asshats that host the US version of ""What Not To Wear""."

Mr. Richard Butler, I love you more and more each day.  Your post on the www.burneddowndays.com discussion board almost brought me to tears, cuz that's the sort of stuff fans want to see.  We need to know you appreciate us and that you care.

Unlike SOME people who toured this year (and shall remain nameless-you know who you are)and just spewed shit to whatever journalist would listen instead of appreciating the fact that despite your shit spewing (and mediocre solo effort), people actually showed up to your gigs.

I guess I just like a little appreciation for my faithfulness.  That is all."

Missed the H&M opening on Friday, which was probably a good thing after seeing the crowds lined up around the building on the news.  I think I'll make it down there this Friday (payday!). 

The In Style thing was good. Got there early and hung with the girlies before the madness began.  They got smart this year and gave you a ticket to recieve your gift bag - probably because of Marcie and I getting in the gift bag line numerous times last year.  Not a whole heck of a lot in it - the new Gilette razor, t-shirt, box of tampons (still questioning this one), full size Essie nailpolish, InStyle magazine(natch), Rembrandt toothpaste, and a few others that escape me. The Spiegel bags were crap.  Vinyl.  Last year they were lovely linen (scored 4). Got a box of the L'Oreal hair color/highlight kit, tons of John Frieda frizz ease stuff, bra fitting by Bali (with 2 free bras in the mail), lots of mini-Evian bottles, snack size Philly cheescakes...oh the list goes on and on.  Still not as good as last year, but madame senior editor reminded us that next year is the InStyle 10 year anniversary, so hopefully they'll have much more free crap for that.

Spent Saturday night at my cousin's housewarming party in middle of nowhere, Illinois. The only good thing about moving to the boonies is the space.  Huge yard, huge house, obscenely huge airplane hangar-like garage/storage area. All for half the price of a small bungalow in the city.  'Twas lovely to see the aunts/uncles/cousins.  I must admit that my family does know how to throw a damn good party and have a damn good time.  I love them.

I wanted to murder every last one of them, starting with the mother Trixies yakking on their ghetto phones while their Trixie spawn sat in the carts(placed strategically in the middle of the aisles - God forbid we actually make room for anyone else!) and screamed bloody murder. I'd then move on to the junior Trixies wandering aimlessly through the store yakking on their ghetto phones and finding the need to flail their free arm about, as if there is no one else in the store, especially not someone trying to pass their rude ass.  And don't even get me started on the Chads (male Trixies).  What the fuck is wrong with people?  No excuse me, no thank you, no please anymore.  I'm going to start responding to people with ""go fuck yourself"".  If someone sneezes, ""go fuck yourself"".  If someone bumps into me, ""go fuck yourself"".  You get the picture.

Geoff is out of town until Thursday, so I spent the weekend with my favorite boys, Jorden and Joe.  It was gay bar weekend!  Saturday was Big Chicks, Holiday Club (the token straight bar) and Charlies.  Sunday was a lot more fun starting at Hydrate (the new twink bar), Roscoe's (with bad 80's videos all night) and Sidetracks (with even better bad 80's videos).  Good time had by all. Jorden wants me to head out to Sidetracks tonight for Retro night, but I've come to the realization that I'm really getting too old to be heading out to the bars more that twice a week.

"event","I've decided to revamp my dollhouse and I need your help.  It is a 12 room house and I'm starting from the ground up.  Repainting the outside, stripping the existing flooring, wallpaper and carpeting and rewiring where needed.  To give you an idea, it looks like this: <lj-cut text=""The house that Fiona built""> <img src=""http://209.240.4.82/mollysmini/images/RGT/RGMP1700.jpg""/> </lj-cut> 

This is where YOU come in.  Help me with a theme, please.  Anything.  I've toyed with victorian, tudor, goth, etc. but nothing sounds ""fabulous"".  It's a beautiful house and I'm willing to put a lot of time and effort into it.  Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks!"

"event","What a fun show last night.  I have to say that the Furs are in my top 3 must see live acts.  They always put on an amazing show and never dissapoint.  Last night was no exception despite the mini-monsoon.  It rained like a bitch, but they didn't stop and we didn't leave.  Furs fans rock.  The loyalty and camaraderie are like none I've ever seen for a band. Also, since this was Goose Island fest, the beer was goooooood!  The site itself was not at the brewery, but at some steel mill in the ""industrial"" part o'town, but the horrible stench of ass couldn't keep any of us away.

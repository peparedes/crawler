"event","I have to wonder what the point is sometimes. A lot of people use their lj's to make a statement (political, religious, etc) But I don't ever think i have done that. I don't like to proclaim my rants like that."

"event","So last Saturday was my birthday. 25 years old... and man, does the old part ring in my ears. I woke up sunday morning kinda hung over and felt even older. Then Monday, I was sent home with a fever of 100.2, a bottle of horrid cough syrup, some antibiotics, and flonase. I hate allergies. They are the bain of my existence. Every year I end up with some upper respitory issue due to them. This time it was sinusitis and orogeanpharylitis (tonsilitis for short) I spent two days in bed resting. I am now back to work and tired as ever... yuck. 

More later cause it's time to go home!"

"event","Today has been... I don't know. It's just been. Is that a state? Can you just be? The tiff with Dave continues. Sometimes I wish I had the extra $300 just laying around to get him off my back. But this next month is spoken for. Between my bk, paying dad back, and taking care of other bills it is all spoken for. Short of giving him increments of $20 every paycheck till I can afford a more substantial amount, there is nothing else I can do. I went off my diet. I have been feeling absolutely horrible lately. It has seemed to get progressively worse. Today I felt a lot better. I think i may hold to some of the standards already set. I tried to eat my cereal this morning and it was so sickningly sweet I almost couldn't stomach it. Tomorrow I am going to eat regular corn flakes. I am still not using real milk. I think i like the thinkness of the soymilk. I am not planning on drinking it straight. (I can't do that with real milk as it is) But it is better on cereal and in shakes. It has a higher protein content and if you get the right kind, less fat and sugar. 

Change of subject... I dropped my Pharm class today. Last week's class sent a very LOUD message. I can't waste time on things that should be known prior to entering the class. I talked to the counselors about it and they agreed with my decision. After the slip was turned in, it felt like a large weight had been lifted off my shoulders."

"event","Well, the earthquake hasn't happened yet. But the day isn't over yet. I really would've rather it hit while I was at work. The hospital is actually quite a safe place to be. It is built on rollers."

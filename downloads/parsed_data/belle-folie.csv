Anyway, I'll outline my summer and it's amazingness!

I had a week at home, and I got together with people almost every day.  That was fun.  I also had to pack for Duke, and, honestly, I didn't want to go because the previous year was SO awesome.  I figured that this year would stink.  You have no idea how nervous I was to go.  Seriously, I felt sick.

Then, there was TiP.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER.  My entire RAG (A RAG is an RA Group.  Your RA is your Residential Advisor.  They're counselor-ish people.  And a RAG has girls on the same hall.  You become closest with your RAG generally or at least your hall because you have to spend time with your RAG... and you live with them.) was really close.  Those girls are amazing!  This term was crazy.  There were a LOT of ups and downs.  But the ups were SO good that they made the downs not that bad.  Not to mention that people always seemed to make me feel better in the downs.  Okay, I won't get started on the things I actually did. <333333333333333333333333333333333333333.

A week off of moping and missing TiP /so/ much.  I still miss it, of course, I probably will always have random moments when I cry because I miss those times.  But this week was especially lonely and sad.  Actually, now I feel sad because of thinking about how much I miss Duke.  And Good Riddance just came on.  (I cry almost every time I hear that song.  I sobbed when they played it at Duke at the last dance... and kept sobbing for almost another hour.  Seriously.  That song makes me so sad.)

Then the beach!!  So much fun!  Even though I burned pretty badly.  Probably my best year at Kiawah.  I went to the beach chained down by society, and I AM LIBERATED!!!  ...Don't ask.

Then, Drivers Ed.  Oh God, just kill me now.  I had the hardest teacher out of 30 some.  Yay!  It was horrible.  I barely passed.  Thankfully, I did.  I would cut off my arm before repeating it.  Well, almost.  That'd probably hurt.

And just another week of being pretty bored and getting together with people every once in a while with a little bit of missing Duke thrown in.  Okay, a lot of missing Duke.

School starts up soon!  Insane, isn't it?!"

I like to sleep, but going to bed.  Before I go to bed, I spend quite a while thinking.  Now, though, it makes me upset.

I wanted to sleep in my parent's room two nights ago.  I actually found myself crying outside their door about to go in.  And then I realized that it was just my dad and realized how messed up the whole scenario was.

I feel terrible.  I never played Clair de Lune for him.  I didn't go to go get coins when he wanted me to.  I never /really/ heeded what he said when he became senile.  And, now, I can't.  I can /never/ play the song for him.  He always wanted me to, but I was never able to.  Clair de Lune isn't your cakewalk in the park kind of song.  I only started playing it a month and a half ago, and I never played it for him.  I never even saw him.  At Teti's funeral, we were warning him about his feet because they were swollen, and we thought everthing added up to heart failure.  And we said that the next time we came down would be for his... and, now, I feel sick that my mom and my aunt mentioned that.  Because, we are.

And I'm way too selfish in this, too.  Because, now, my grandma is all alone in her house, which she can't be, especially being a feeble old lady who can't drive, climb stairs, and has emphezema.  I don't really care how much I butchered that spellling.  She'll probably live with Mom, Dad, and I half the year and then live with my aunt and uncle the other half.  But that would be lifestyle changes for /me/.  And I'm too selfish to want to.  But I want to be with my grandma... just not forever.

That just makes me feel even worse because everyone around her is dead, practically.  Her sisters and her husband.  And I don't want her to stay with us half a year.  I'm sick.

And I never played Clair de Lune."

How sweet.  I'm not that much of a hopeless romantic, though.  Well, at least I don't think so.

"event","I saw the Hot Mikado last night.  I thought it had a lot of talent, and I liked the production.  I don't think that the play itself is that great, though.  Today was the first practice for the Wiz.  Because I'm a dancer, I officially have no lines and am a brick road.  Goody.  I was supposed to go to the swim banquet but didn't.  My dad and I had a fight.

And that's my exciting weekend."

I think I'll put more surveys and stuff in here than in my Xanga.  It's easier to use Xanga.  At least I think so.  Plus, I don't really know who has a LJ.

...Okay.  I'll stop rambling now.</size>"

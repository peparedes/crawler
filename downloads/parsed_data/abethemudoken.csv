"event","went to petland over the weekend and got some new fish.  4 neon tetras and a baby red eye tetra.  all are well and no other fish have died so i am happy.  the baby tetra seems a bit scared but he is hiding in the fake weeds so i think he will be fine.  he just needs to grow a little bit more.  also changed the filter junk yesterday and got a new net that is bigger so it will be easier to catch the fishies if i need to for whatever reason.  i wanted to get a himalayan cat as well but steve said no.  he said the cat was too vain and that we couldn't afford it.  so there was this other kitten i wanted and he also said no to it.  i was not happy.  i wanted them both.  they were so cute and i bonded with both of them.  but steve said no and i listened to him because i have to live with him and he would kill me if i bought them.  so there you go.  nothing else to talk about so i guess i will sign off here and go back to staring at the tank.  yay.  i am so bored.  and i really like watching myself type.  i like the way my hands move.  it's cool.  i am so weird like that."

"event","Panic erupted in the Tank today as preparations were being made for a partial water change.  As plants and tank decorations were being moved to facilitate gravel vacing the dead bodies of two fish were found decomposing behind the largest plant.  They were identified as a Neon Tetra and a Cherry Barb.  Cause of death is unknown at this time, but the deaths are believed to be in connection with the enormous death toll among the snail population.  At this time, it is known to the owner of the Tank that some 60 snail juvaniles along with one adult have died since April this year.  One snail remains alive, Mac.  He is showing signs of strain though as his shell is beginning to crack.

When asked for comment, no one in the tank community was eager to talk to reporters, though one fish (a Tiger Barb) was distinctly heard to say ""Bitch better get some better meds or I am going to bust a cap in her ass.""

Owners of the Tank could not be reached for comment, though we have received a prepared statement which is presented below.

This makes for the third round of deaths in the tank in the past few weeks.  Speculation at this time seems to center around the introduction of two Mixed Fruit Tetras as the suspected cause of the illnesses suffered by community members.

In a related item, the other Cherry Barb has died as well, due in part to a bout of Ick, but also because the owner of the tank euthanized it when it became apparent the Barb would not survive the Ick.  We can only hope his death is the last death in the Tank community.

Below is the prepared statement given on behalf of the owners of the Tank, Jennifer and Steven, by thier cat Pepper.

""Good evening.  Recent events in our Fish Tank Community have made it apparent that in order to stem the panic that has ensued something must be said.  At this time, Jennifer and Steven are doing everything they can to ensure a healthy, happy environment for all Aquatic life in their apartment.  While we do not know the cause of recent problems, we do know that if their is anything in our power to help stem the rising death toll, we will do whatever it takes.  Preventative measures such as more frequent feedings, more frequent water changes, filter supply maintenance, and gravel vacing are already being put into place as part of a rigerious plan to help safeguard the health and well being of our Aquatic friends.  When we know the truth behind the deaths of the Neon Tetra, the Cherry Barb, the two Mixed Fruit Tetras, the Red Eye Tetra, and the Baby Snails we will release another statement in order to educate the people and help prevent another massacre like the one we have just suffered.  We thank you for your time and patience, and we hold the family and friends of the dead in our hearts, our minds, and our prayers.  Goodnight, and God bless."""

"event","the medication i used in the tank killed off all the baby snails.  not happy about that.  we euthanized the blue fruity ass tetra because the ick was getting worse and i was afraid it would kill more of our fish.  moral to the story is never name fish after yourself.  ever.  bad ju ju.  so as soon as the medication has run it's course (friday) i am changing the water like a crazed monkey and getting my filter back on schedule.  steve bought a new tank heater which is huge but kinda cool looking too.  our heater broke so it is a good thing he bought it.  once i do the water change i am going to somewhere (don't know where cause i am mad at jim right now) to repopulate the tank a little bit.  i want at least three more fish.  the tiger barb is acting weirder than usual so i might be getting ready to euthanize another fishie.  i totally need to get that water changed tho.  fishies are not happy with me right now.  ok i am tired.  enough of this death and destruction.  night night."

Stephen is the green one and Jen is the blue one.  named for me and steve but then again not so that if/when they die it won't be linked to us.  i might rename them anyway now that i think about it.  so that's about it other than i am thinking about redecorating the tank tomorrow.  we'll see.  might have to go get new gravle and junk.  who knows?"

"event","First of all the baby snails hatched today!!  They are definitely rams horn snails.  I am so excited!  We have baby snails roving around the tank!  I hope they survive.  Also Steve discovered some pink roe and put it in the breeder tank thingy and I looked them up and lo and behold they are another species of snail.  But these eggs have to be kept out of the water so I hope Steve didn't drown them when he put them in the breeder.  This is kind of a mystery though.  I mean I can see the two snails having sex and producing eggs.  But two different species of eggs with two different incubation methods?  It's a mystery.  Near as I can figure we got the rams horn when she was already preggers and Chip got Mac preggers before he died.  But that doesn't really make sense because Chip died months ago whereas we have only had the rams horn about a month or so.  So i don't know how Mac had the pink eggs, but I do know it has to be Mac because of the type of eggs they are.  Rams horns have different eggs than Green Apples.  So who knows...we just have a bunch of tiny miracles in the tank at the moment.  I am so happy and so excited to see if the pink ones hatch!  We'll know in about 3 weeks.  Yay!!"

"event","The snail eggs have doubled in size and have become clear.  We can see all the baby snails in them now.  Yay!  They are getting bigger and at the moment they are a sort of clearish tan colour.  They look like Green Apple snails to me but Steve is of the opinion that Madison (the Ram's Horn) was pregnant when we got her.  I disagree.  I maintain the opinion that Mac and Madison got it on and we have hybrid snails (if that is possible).  In any case, it is just a relief to know that they are viable embryos considering the trauma we put some of them through to get them  into the breeder flotation tank thingy.  There are a few eggs that haven't developed, but there are still probably about 20 embryos in there.  Don't know what we are going to do with all them baby snails when they hatch.  Steve mentioned selling them to Jim (our favorite pet guru) but I would like to keep a few just to watch them develope to the size that Mac is (just a bit smaller than my palm).  So we'll see once they hatch.  I am a bit concerned that they are not going to develope any further because none of them are moving about in the eggs, but Steve is optomistic and I am trying to be.  The website on Green Apple snails has a movie showing baby snails swimming in their eggs after ten days so we are going to wait to worry till they are ten days old.  In any case, I need to find out the gestation period of snails so I know when to expect a hatching.  Madison seems to be very interested in the floating tank thingy so I think she may be trying to tend the eggs, further proof that she is the mother.  Then again, she may be trying to eat them.  Who knows?"

"event","so i woke up today groggy as hell and looked at the aquarium.  it was dark so i missed it at first, but then i finally saw it.  i couldn't tell what it was so i took a piss and lit a ciggie.  then i remembered that we have a light on the hood of the aquarium (bite me i had only been conscious about 10 minutes).  so i switched on the aquarium and lo and behold there was a cluster of about 50 eggs on the side of the tank.  oh shit!  i stood there with my mouth open for a minute and kept saying over and over ""eggs...oh my god...eggs...oh boy...what do i do?""  it was comical.  i woke steve up and he kinda grunted and rolled over and then i had to get dressed and get some breakie so i could go to work.  so when i got home tonite steve and i stared at the eggs and deduced that they must be snail eggs.  so i looked it up on this one snail website i love cause it is informative as hell and sure enough, our rams horn snail has laid eggs.  so i got all excited and then i saw the cherry barbs eating the eggs.  CANIBALS!!  so after about 15 mins work steve and i got the eggs safely into our floating baby fish habitat (don't know what it is called).  i am ascared that we killed some of them but i am optomistic that we will have a fleet of baby hybrid snails soon.  i say hybrid because we have 2 different species of snails in our tank so who knows what the babies will look like.  i'm so excited!!!  we could actually see forming embryos this evening.  according to the website we should be able to see the baby snails in their eggs in about 10 days.  YAY!!  only problem is what to do with the babies once they are born (hatched?).  plus i don't know what to feed the little buggers.  but i am still excited.  we're gonna have baby snails!!!!!"

the fish are being entertaining right now.  everyone seems healthy in the main tank.  they are swimming in the bubble curtain being funny.  it's amusing to watch them suddenly float to the top of the tank on the bubbles as they swim through.  and it is always amusing to watch the snail suddenly let go of the side of the tank and drop like a stone onto the plants without bending any of the plants over.  i love my snails!!

"event","It was an epic battle.  Worthy of Beowolf.  It all started this evening when I was eating my lovely pork that my man lovingly grilled for me.  I looked at the tank and lo and behold, one of the tiger barbs has developed freshwater velvet.  For those who do not know, freshwater velvet is a parasite that makes your fish look greyish and sparkley.  As if they have been sprinkled with gold dust.  So once my dinner was finished I cleaned out the hospital tank ( a mere 2.5 gallon plastic affair in designer purple) and put my wardly kill-all-external-parasites medication in it.  Then the battle began.  You see, my main tank is a 20 gallon tall tank.  It is not as long as a regular tank and when it is on it's stand, I have to stand on a chair and take out a bit of water to reach the bottom to redecorate and whatnot.  It has quite a few plastic plants in the background and a little pagoda left over from my 10 gallon days.  Unfortunately since we just recently got the 20 gallon I have yet to purchase a new net to catch the fish in so I still have the teeeeenny tiiiiinny one the 10 gallon came with.  That was a major problem.  From the outset in order to catch the sick fish I had to stick most of my arm into the tank to chase it around.  Then our green apple snail got in the way.  Then the ramshorn snail got in the way.  Then the fish decided to hide in a knot of plants and not come out no matter how hard I jiggled the plants around.  But finally, after a half an hour of playing marco pollo in the weeds I got him moved to the hospital tank.  Then I spent another few minutes getting the other two tiger barbs into the hospital tank because I noticed they were showing signs of the parasite as well.  Ugh.  None of the other fish seem to have it thank the maker!<p> A little background on my little community...we began with a $20 meijer tank and 3 goldfish that all died within a week.  Then we repopulated with 2 Platys and an albino cory catfish.  Then we went through about 4 neon tetras.  One held on over a year, through Ich and losing scales and constipation, only to pass on when we got the new tank.  In fact, the new tank killed off our original 2 tiger barbs, our last remaining black fancytail guppie, and that neon.  We have had three male cherry barbs (one deceased), 2 albino corys (once deceased), 2 orange with black tails and fins and mustaches platys (still kickin), 3 green apple snails (one murdered by the other, one killed by us in our ignorance), 1 ramshorn snail (still kickin), 5 tiger barbs (2 deceased), 5 neon tetras (4 deceased), 2 red eye tetras (still kickin), 2 black fancytail guppies (both deceased), 2 red fancytail guppies (still kickin), 3 goldfish (all deceased), 5 zebra danios (3 deceased), and 2 frogs (still kickin).  Quite a death toll.  But we finally have this whole aquarium thing down pat.  Yay!  Currently, for those who can't follow, our community consists of:  Mac the green apple snail, Madison the ramshorn snail, Kermit and Robin the frogs, Heidi and Fritz the platys, Ming the albino cory catfish, 2 red eye tetras, 1 neon tetra, 2 cherry barbs, 3 tiger barbs, 2 zebra danios, 2 red fancytail guppies, and three cats (Pepper, Ginger, and Curry) who sit for hours facinated by the fish dinner just beyond their paws.  Also, the platys have had three generations of babies of which 2 have survived.  The third generation we didn't know about until one of the guppies was seen to be eating the last of the fry.  Damn.  We are soon going to try to breed the platys and try to keep as many of the fry as possible.  The last three times were unexpected miracles.  We didn't even know we had a male and female.  <p>well, until tomorrow.  Keep your stick on the ice."

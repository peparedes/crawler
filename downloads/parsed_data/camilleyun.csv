I attended a performing arts college that consisted of multiple brick buildings with underground tunnels and quad pathways large enough to drive tanks through. The stairwells were so narrow people could only fit single-file and the metal dorm room doors had gaps wide enough from the floor to slide canisters of tear gas underneath if necessary. Rumor had it that the campus was built with riots in mind but that is a whole other story. 

A call came in to my dorm phone. It was my friend Denise telling me through hyperventilated giggles to meet her in the basement of the F dorm. Uh oh. 

I ran down the stairs and heard her before I saw her. She was drunk and creating havoc in the kitchen. Grabbing a gigantic tray of muffins longer than she was wide, she exclaimed through laughs, ""I've been baking!"" then accidentally tipped the tray sending baked goods soaring through the air in all directions. I suggested we get out of there quickly so we did but not before we each grabbed a blueberry muffin 'to go'."

&quot;Do you want to see something weird?&quot;, he asked, already knowing the answer. I nodded and followed excitedly, almost skipping then tripping because I am just not very coordinated.

The young, beautiful, blond boy with tousled hair had approached me moments earlier while I walked my dog. He had struck up a conversation with me by telling me he was not following me even though he had been walking behind me for quite some time. It made me smile.

Not that it matters but my dog is a boxer named Nelson with hair as ginger as mine which tends to attract a lot of uninvited public attention that I typically ignore because it makes me nervous.&nbsp; I had taken a different path that day because the weather was changing and I liked hearing the sound of leaves crunching beneath my feet while a soft, slow wind blew my curls into the vanilla flavored lip gloss I wear [which is really not as annoying as it might sound].

We walked in silence except for my occasional entanglements with the leash and the 100-pound drooling canine attached to it.

The sky had grown dark with night so we could barely see since there were hardly any street lamps in this part of town. Without a word, we carefully passed through the black wrought iron gates and walked around a pond surrounded by stones. I eyeballed a sign etched in stone which read, &quot;memorial for unborn children&quot;.

The boy explained this was one of his favorite places because he found it peaceful and comforting not to mention that it was open 24 hours so we would not get in trouble for being there and could go any time we wanted.

We went inside a building that looked like a modern church. There were plaques with names adorning the walls with handwritten letters, plush toys, and baby clothes left on the shelf below. It was all quite overwhelming. I had no idea what to say.

He motioned that we should step back outside to the rear of the building and placed his hand on the small of my back to guide me down some stairs. In the distance I could see a gazebo. It grew closer and soon we sat side by side on a wooden bench inside it.

&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;, I asked him, not knowing the answer. &quot;I would very much like to kiss you&quot;, he said, then added, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if that would be appropriate&quot;. I was not sure what the etiquette would be either but told him it would be okay anyway.

His lips were soft and gentle. The kiss felt pure and innocent, almost otherworldly, as his hand found mine and he held it the rest of the way home.

He walked me to my porch then I asked him where he lived. &quot;Over yonder in 118&quot;, he said, gesturing in some indeterminate direction. I would have asked for clarification but he said he had to go. As he was walking away, I asked if I would see him again and he promised I would. Because I am terrible at goodbyes, I detained him for another moment longer inquiring apropos of nothing if he knew how to skateboard. He said he used to but not anymore then asked bemusedly where on earth that question came from. &quot;Nowhere, really&quot;, I said, &quot;that was just me being awkward&quot;.

He threw his head back and chortled once, genuinely, as I saw him smile with his eyes which I stared into trying to figure out what color they were at that moment. &quot;I am photographing this moment in my mind&quot;, I told him as he repeated that he had to go. I did not watch him walk away but wondered if I turned around would I see him looking back at me. I am disgustingly romantic and highly sensitive [read: neurotic] person so I did not want to risk finding out.

As if I do not see enough of her already, I met up with my roommate the following day at a local coffee shop named after a famous painter. I am not a coffee drinker so it makes sense that I had never been there before. She was prattling on about the different boys she dates and having to do a CSI-inspired DNA sweep after each one [now THAT is a whole other story in itself] as we walked around the building to where her car was parked.

It is not unusual for me to be distracted or for something to catch my eye so I wandered off into an alley as she called out after me. She caught up with me and asked impatiently what I was so taken with. It was an effigy of a boy on a skateboard. In an alley. Behind a cafe. How odd! I was enthralled by how much it looked like the boy from last night which I had not told her about because to talk about it would have made the experience less mine. Besides, compared to her anecdotes and dramatic antics, it would probably seem extremely silly.

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; she urged, tugging on the bottom left corner of my Kermit the Frog t-shirt. [I hate it when she does that!]

Desperate to see that boy again, I took Nelson for more walks than usual that evening eagerly scanning all the roads around me for #118 but did not find any. Days turned into weeks then months. Still no boy.

I entered the coffee shop seeking out a hot chocolate and remembered the statue in the alley planning to gawk at it again once I had warmed up a bit. Except for one other customer, the shop was empty. I just knew she was going to chat me up before I could get out of there and I was not wrong. She was an older woman who said she had lived different places but this was her favorite. Since we were already talking anyway, I asked her about the sculpture. She told me no one really knows for sure but local lore suggests an anonymous contributor placed the statue there years ago and no one has ever questioned it.

I thanked her and walking around the building into the alley. I stood before the stone boy trapped forever in motion on his skateboard. As I lovingly brushed the snow off him I noticed a worn, barely legible plaque with a single name engraved; Evan. &quot;Evan&quot;, I said aloud and looked around to make sure no one saw me since I am pretty sure it would look rather strange that I was talking to myself. I guess he really was telling me the truth when he promised I would see him again. Only it was not exactly the way I had imagined it would be.

This is a work of fiction but was inspired by this statue:

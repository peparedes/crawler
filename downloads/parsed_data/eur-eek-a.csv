You don't know this, but I have failed to give you your due.  And today I must officially apologize for this.  I'm sorry I talked trash on you; sorry I naysayed the voice, the later albums, the love of soundclips.  Dear Dave, I am so sorry that my full appreciation of your talent came after I realized just how very awful Megadeth might have sounded, in a terrible alternate universe.  For even the worst song has your voice, and you (I confess!) can hit quite a nice range of notes on that growly instrument, with personality, with style apt for each passage of the song, even with what non-metal folks consider ""proper"" singing.  Thank you, Dave.  Even the worst Megadeth album posses two or three songs which are good.  Thank you, Dave, for making music to soothe my nerves after the fool's errand I undertook; to listen to one ""Celtic Frost,"" known as an early metal influence (fortunately long surpassed); for each of these fine qualities I have listed which even your lesser efforts boast are utterly lacking in this band, and acutely did I feel that lack.

"event","I believe I shall stash some music-related thoughts here.  Musings less apt for Bran's space.

So the distinction between my brother's metal and mine boils down to this: virtuosity.  I fucking hate it when a musician stops the <i>song</i> to wank over how good he is at what he does.  There are good solos!  Yes!  Listened to <i>Like a Stone</i> today and no doubt the world is better for the surpassing loveliness of that high-tone guitar bit that just cleaves open your chest and wrenches the muscle strands in the heart and says, <i>I am too pretty for indifference!</i>.  Added value, yes.  I do not disdain all movement from the groove; even better than the bonus melody is the tricksy bits, by which I mean <i>Thirteen.... thirteen... thirteen... STEPS</i>.  There you are, head bobbin', loving it, and then the tempo sticks, sticks, aaaah the tension is good! And grooves again.  And sticks.  Beautiful.  I will curse you for that shit, but I will be loving it all the same.

The bother is the prog crap-tendencies.  Melodic progression, technicality, blah whatever.  That shit needs to serve, not own.  Yeah, there's a genius in being able to pull sounds out of your instrument unknown to man, or speed, or whatever frills you please, but the genius I value most is the the genius of the riff; writing three notes that pull in a way no other three-note phrase does.   Now that is hard.  And consider that even in academia-music, that is loved.  Beethoven, friends.  The 5th, the 9th.  Composition, structure, and a goddamn catchy bit for them to stand on.  You cannot go without solid ground, all hop-scotching over lava and whatnot - that works a different set of muscles entirely. Namely improvisation.  When you've internalized the skills that way, you can do what you like.  In the meantime, quit wasting our time with two-minute show and tell time.

Of course, just as importantly, we shall never agree on hard/heavy divide.  If metal is too fast for a good up and down range of motion on each headbangin' beat it is too goddamn fast. My neck doesn't like to move that quick.  Too bad.

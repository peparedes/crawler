Yes, I have a contract job. The frist part was 40 hours (apx of work), and they paid 1/2 up front, when I could deminstrate a proof of concept on Monday. The Project will be finished on next Tues, a few days early.

Project A - Simple, work around for solution, and a Data Interperation system.
Project B - Pulling the data directly from the system, and doing all the processing in the excel program directly, to allow greater scale up of resources

Project C - Automating a system.

After saving a chunkc back for taxes, I'll be making more a week than I was at my old job. Which is fitting, as I was SERIOUSLY underpaid. And they knew it.

When I get project B done... We talk long term. I will likly be signing a 1-5 year contract, to work exclusinvly for them. Which means, I have a home office. And working from home means all sorts of things.

Even if it dosn't pan out, this project should get me a good 3K for the house fund.

Oh - and the Owner is pretty cool. He buys breakfast at all early morning meetings. And when I mentioned I would be buying Office 2007 with the 1/2 payment on project B, he BOUGHT a copy for me to use. That was cool.

Right now, I'm sitting and watching the second system test complete. When that's done, I go home and start on the other three parts of this.

Tues, 10 am, Supposed to meet them with a done project.

I LOVE being able to work again."

I vacationed until Wed. Then pulled out a 12 hour programing binge.

Today was the day of baking. I got the urge to cook, and churned out a bunch of goodies. I figured with the Cam domain meeting and social tonight, and the Troupe game tomorrow, i could share.

Cam... Well, after this evening, I'm working on the email to ask to be a regional independent member. Today I got told that the inconvenience of getting smokers inside for a domain meeting was more important than my physical ability to attend said meeting. And that I could listen from inside via a half open door, if I wanted to attend.

I'm sorry - but I like breathing. More importantly, I like the fact that I haven't, had to have 6 rounds of antibiotics this winter OR any prescription level antihistamines, just from limiting my exposure to any allergen. Yes, it means I'm on 3 meds a day, a nasal rinse, and an inhaler, but it works for me.

Talked to a recruiter in Phoenix yesterday. That looks pretty promising.

The Vegas job posts on Friday. It's work I would utterly hate, but I feel obligated to take because my Father in law pulled some strings.

Please - Just let this all work out somehow!

"event","So, I'm now pondering not going to ICC this year. First time I would have missed it since joining the Camarilla.

Reasons for going:
1. Friend of mine's last mage game they are running.
2. Seeing a handful of people I don't get to see often.

Reasons to skip:
1. Frustrated with the OOC side of the Camarilla right now.
2. I don't play anything other than mage.
3. I won't seem to get enough time with the people I do want to see.
4. Utter frustration at the lack of anything I do seeming to matter anymore.

If I do go, I'm flying in late.

Anyone got more of a reason for me to go?

Other options: Have a friend come visit that weeked, and then go home that month."

Not that someone is getting up and preaching this. But that an evangelical preacher is standing up and saying these things, despite losing a fifth of his church and despite the pressure to conform to the ""normal"" ideas for that sect.

My parents are religious. They love their new church, attend most weekends they are in town, and drag me with them when I visit. They are also extremely democratic and fixtures at the local party events.

Faith dose not make you Republican. Faith is between you and God, and in how you live your life. Politics shouldn't matter."

<b>Borrowed from the <lj user=""professor""></b>

<i>March was not a happy month for many people. In fact, 2007 to-date has seemed determined to be the year of bad emotional shit.

So I'm suggesting something different for today. Be a different kind of fool -- a springtime fool. A Tarot Fool. Start the journey fresh, with a leap off the cliff not of trickery, but hope. Do something positive, something that brings a smile. For yourself, for someone else. Make it small, or huge, planned or impulsive.

But do it quietly, without fanfare, for the simple act of bringing joy.

And spread the word. </i>"

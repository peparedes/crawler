"event","I can't see any improvement in my english skills since the day I arrived to the University. Besides the fact that I'm always communicating in english with my classmates, it is hard to identify the correct words and/or grammar structure to express my ideas.

I will seek for additional and extracurricular support. Activitiesd related to Grammar will also help me.

Generally speaking I feel very good. My weekend trip to new York was    Amazing!!!!! Ny is a beautiful and multifacetical city. I felt like a little creature in the middle of a cement forest and when  i say ""little creature"" i mean it.

Classes are more interersting but I could be better if I can get a girlfriend an native speaker to shqre my time and improve my english at the same time.

Concerning classes...we saw Bowling Columbia. It was a shocking experience for me to face an autocritics documentary which is focused on facts related with the roots and and basis of the american society. 

The discussion class for wednesday will be quite interestin since we'll argue on topics really controversial. I 'm looking forward to hear the european psotion on this matter.

That's all...."

"event","Finally, after 23 hours of traveling by plane. I reached new Haven herein USA. It has been a few day since I've written in this journal and, as a consequence, I didn't have the chance to update it.

USA is a beautiful country, and of course Yale University, which is the place where I am presently writing. Yale has amazing and huge instalations. The histiry and backgrounds that involve this  University provide me and all the students a funny feeling.

I sometimes feel a little bad because I think that I already lost my chance to enter this Univesrity. Even though it's really but really dificult to be accepted by Yale, Hope and envy for the new students who has beenn accepted to perform an LLM are the feelings that sometimes arise from my mind. It is not possible for me to leave my job for longer periods but I'll try to return USA every summ,er...maybe not every summer but at least once per year in order to assist other summer classes and internships.

I also feel that my english is getting worst due to the necessity to comunicate my ideas in such a way that grammar, accent, pronunciation and all that stuff become lesser important.
 need to work on this issue."

"event","I have been to brazil, rio De Janeiro from Sunday 28 until today (noon). What a beautiful place!!! This is the perfect merge between nature and a big city. The beach!!! People I met!!! the food!!!. a beatiful experience.

I also had the chance to meet co-workers who came from different places and countries. I specially enjoy to find easy going people, young and really considerate. Disregard that aI just have one bad experience during my poresentation, this little problem benefited me to improve the first impression i projected before my bosses.

I also realized that my englishh should be improved to have a fluent communication with other lawyers. Sometimes i felt desperate for not explaining my ideas and thoughts. This problem will be solved soon.

Rio is a good place to rest and enjoy. The women ....mmm. 

I enjoyed very much talk with m of this great experience. I really appreciate her...is a very good friend

I could beat the barriers that sometimes my personality has and found new friend

Thanks Brazil...I feel stronger..."

N good offer came to me this afternoon. A friend of mine wants to buy my Jimny. I think I will do sale and I will use the extra money in my planned trip to USA. However I am starting to feel a little sad since this car has been object of my attention, dedication, love and money. I focused my attention on this car even more than any girlfriend a had. 
If I sale my car tomorrow...well..I will miss her."

"event","This Monday I have decided to change a few things in my life. First I will go to the Gym every day at 5:30 a.m. until June 27. This decision responds to my desire of taking care of my health now on. I realize that I am 27 years old...oh my god.

Second, I will improve my English skills within my work and my daily activities in order to assist the University in USA in the best academic conditions. I need to approve the first exam.

Finally. I also realized that I am very, but very happy living alone. I think that this is getting a little dangerous. Therefore, I need to meet new and different  friends.

I look forward to comply with this statements during the next month.

Concerning my trip to Rio de Janeiro this sunday, I have to confess that I am a little nervous. Tomorrow I will prepare my presentations.

My sister is fine, I talked to her yesterday...I will talk my grandma tomorrow."

ok i dont get this. the end of my whole ordeal, traumatic expierence, stress whatever you want to call it crap is over with. done finished thank the good LORD in heaven above. so why do i feel the weight of the world bearing down on me now at this point? its like i pushed aside all of that worry and anxiety for a year and a half and now thats its over and should be gone, then bam it comes pouring down on me. its honestly overwhelming me. i dont get why. and i keep trying to tell myself, you've made it this far. the end of it is not the time to fall apart.

and i wont fall apart. i know that. i guess that its just that i am finally letting all the stress go and its going to take some time to work itself out. maybe thats it? haha who knows. anyways so yeah thats all i have to say at this point. lol. maybe things will get better."

"event","i'm going to do another update since i'm sitting here at work on a saturday and bored to death. 

its sad because i was going to my grandparents house for our yearly family picnic but the gas situation *sigh* the thing is even if i went and paid almost 4 dollars a gallon for gas, would i even be able to get home? cause here there is no gas..all the gas stations are completly out. driving to work this morning i passed over 10 that were out, and only one that had premuim gas at 3.59 a gallon. so thats scary. and whats also scary is like if people are paying so much for gas they arent going to be buying other things with effects the economy, which effects jobs, which just effects everything. its really really scary. and of course most of all my prayers go out to those in new orleans and surronding areas because they have lost absouletly everything. it is so amazing to me, as i have said alot lately, how one single incident (like a natural disaster) can change everything, in an instant.

oh also theres a little funny story i forgot to share. i found out thursday i had been driving on an expired license for over 3 months. cause in this stupid state they dont send you a notice or anything, and who goes around looking at their drivers license to see if it has expired? so i went to the car dealership to rent a car and found out there. which was so embarrasing. well then i got to thinking about how i got a speeding ticket in july in virginia and the state trooper who stopped me apparently didnt even notice that it was expired!!!!!! i am so very freakin lucky. i could have gotten a very very expensive ticket probably. so theres my stupid idiot story for today. its actually not a very funny story at all. lol. i usually have an idiot story of something stupid i've done just about every day. so sad.
yeah so thats all for today. hope you all have a very lovely labor day weekend. (traveling or not)"

court was tuesday, and i must say it went awesomely well. not only is it the best news in the world that i am finally divorced from the bastard from hell (FINALLY and i am soooo happy) but also we did really really well in court. and i'm not going to sit here and brag about what all i got and all that. but i did well. i wont have to worry about things for a while. lmao.

so whats started now though is the hard part. now that visitation is set up andy is going to be taking the baby every second weekend. and the child is like my life. well i a mean he is my life. and he has hardly spent a day away from me EVER. also, he wont let me take him to church on sundays when he has him which just really pissed me off. the child has not missed a sunday in his life. i have always taken him to church. i can see what andy is trying to do and it has nothing to do with spending time with his son. it has all to do with he just wants to take him away from me to get back at me. thats a terrible way to treat a child. i can just see it in the things that he does already though. so sad. 
so anyways,  its going to take alot of getting used to with the baby not being around. i can already see that i am going to be very very lonely and worried about him all the time, and it REALLY depresses me. today i just wanted to sit at home and cry all day. thats not going to do me a bit of good though, i know that. i am going to have to get over that i guess. i'll have to go out looking for things to occupy my time. 

which speaking of occupying my time, my new house is going to take up alot of that! i'm so excited. my very own brand new house!! its so cute and i have alot of packing to do and then shopping for new furniture and painting and decorating. i'm so excited though. i signed all the contracts for it a week ago and finished all the mortgage stuff up yesterday. so things are looking good for me!

that song thats the hidden track on rascal flatts last album, i put it as ""sarah beth"" in my music entry but  i'm not sure if thats the name of it or not. so i just guessed. but i was surprised to hear it on the radio the other day! and i would listen to it, but yet my wonderful loving sister stole the cd from my car....(oh how i love her)

thats all i have for now i'll update some more later!"

(note the sarcasm) i went to work, started reading a book and couldnt put it down. so halfway through the day, in between 500 interuptions, give or take, i finished the whole book. it was quite good actually. its the new book by sophie kinsella who wrote the shopaholic books, its called ""undomestic goddess"" it was HILARIOUS! loved it. yeah enough about that, i know i am boring. but today is thursday meaning thats the end of a work week for me so YAY! let the weekend begin i guess...

so my sister totalled her car. we are supposed to go out tomorrow looking for new ones. i get to be the lucky person to help her...car shopping is so stressful! although i must say i am quite good at it. the thing car dealers dont realize about me is, i usually ALWAYS get what i want. they underestimate me. so anyways yeah. car shopping tomorrow. fun times.

also andy came over like he always does and about halfway through his visit he announced ""well i wont be around tomorrow or saturday"" i just sat there and looked at him for a while. totally resisting the urge to jump up and down and yell ""YIPEE!"" believe me, it took alot of restraint on my part. i finally had to just walk away laughing, cause the things i could have said...anyways YAY, i dont have to deal with andy for a whole weekend.

still waiting on a job call from the interview on tuesday. i hope and pray they call tomorrow, we will see.

"event","that title is kenny chesney for all ya'll who dont know.) ok then, i have been meaning to do this update for over two weeks. been putting it off cause they arent pleasant memories, but they are memories nonetheless. also, this is going to be an involved post so sorry if its long. here goes.

the first thing i want to say is that its amazing how tragedy can effect your life. its amazing how people respond and how people can be pulled together in just an instant. there are things that happened the week after my cousins death that i never will forget. my familys reaction and how they pulled together simply because ""thats just what we do"" was incredible. i cant say that it was amazing, b/c that would counteract the point, but it was comforting. the most important thing that i learned is that your family is your family FOREVER. they love you FOREVER. they are unchanging, unmoving. and no matter how far you run away from them, they are there. and they will always be there...and its that simple.

my sister called me on monday july 3rd at like 6:30 am balling her eyes out. the previous day, we had just been informed in the middle of church service that our associate pastor, one we were both close to, had been killed in an accident. i thought that it had something to do with that. i was half asleep when she told me ""jeremy's been killed in iraq"" I didnt sleep for days after that. My cousin Jeremy who i grew up with...i was just shocked. the next week i had already planned as my vacation from work, so i decided to take that whole week to spend at my gma's house helping her with stuff that needed to be done for the funeral and so on. i wasnt prepared for the drama there at all. tv crews, newspaper reporters, army people...there everyday. it was a mess. those people had everyone in an emotional mess.
the wake and the funeral...there are some people that you just expect to be emotional. like my sister calling me at 6:30 am. yeah i could handle that from her, cause she's an emotional person. to say the least. when i was at the wake, i counted on my mom's sister angie (who is actually my age and more like my sister, long story) anyways, we were out in the parking lot for the longest time with her trying to get me to go into the building. she finally talked me into going with her to look at the casket. as long as she was going with me i was good. so we walk into the funeral home, get outside the door of the room he was in, and she starts having a breakdown. so then I had to be the one to get her calmed down and into the room. it was me and my aunt (who had just lost her son) that got her to finally calm down. my aunt marched right up to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and said, ""Listen to me, suck it up, and get yourself in there and say goodbye. We have to get through this."" i'm saying all this one because i will never forget it but also just to prove the point that its amazing how people react in tragedy. its forever set a standard in my mind. 
that week was one of the hardest i've ever had to get through. fourtantely, there good and bad in every situation. so heres some of the good (i guess)
i have not been back ""home"" (i call it cause thats where i grew up) since andy left me. my roots are in that place, and thats just one thing that i could not bring myself to face for the longest time. what i realize now is that when i was with andy i became a person that HE made me, something he wanted me to be. it was totally not me. and when he left, the person that he made me and the person i convinced myself i was totally shattered. i didnt want to face that reality. i didnt want to go back home and face that i was going to have to rebuild myself again. but i was forced to do it. and look what i realized! spending that week i learned so many things..one of them is remembering who i am. somewhere in between chasing baby drew through the yard with no shoes on (cause you know they dont wear shoes in wv), pushing my cousin's four wheeler out of the mud, taking a call at midnight when i am at the house by myself that the COWS are out of the fence (im scared of cows btw), or taking a ""hay ride"" with 21 city people from NEW JERSEY up to the cow field, anyways in between this all, i just started laughing hysterically to myself. what a way to have to figure out who you are! good lord above, no wonder i am insane. 

anyways, i hope those two stories connected. all i'm trying to say is because of the situation i was forced to reevaluate some things. and as tough as it was, i have such a greater peace about who I am now. in the midst of such a horrible mess, thank God for small blessings."

ok they lined us up and took us upstairs and the fan club had to go last. behind the 100 THOUSAND radio winners. (that still pisses me off btw) after the radio winners were some sort of people from clays family or clays friends or something. i dunno i didnt talk to them much. they just told me clay got them tickets. and kelly knew who they were. anyways thats not important. so they took us upstairs into the hallway outside the coliseum and it was hot as crap and we had to stand there and wait for her forever. then the line started moving horray and i finally got up to the front. brian asks me if i wanted him to hold my pocketbook for me (which i thought that was kind of sweet) and i'm like no i have presents for her in there. so then its my turn to go and she says hey girl and comes up to me and hugs me. and just so you know, interesting little fact here, her hair is very brittle cause of all the coloring and stuff. not that i was feeling all over her hair but anyways...
so after she hugged me she got right up in my face and said ""and what is your name?"" and i told her and then i said its so hot up here, they had to put you in the hottest place. and then she's like oh honey its nothing like last night believe me, referring to knoxville. and i said yes i know i had a friend who went. then i gave her the book and said this is from me and rachel, its from the broadway musical you know, and she said yes of course i know (duh) and i said, well rachel made me read it so now you have to read it. and she wrinkled her nose and was like well is it any good? and i was like ""ohhh yeah yeah its good"" (like i would give it to her if it wasnt good) and i said well we tried to think of something unique to give you, although i dont know when you would have time to read it. she said oh i love to read, in fact its good for me, cause i have a hard time shutting up, so if i am reading on the bus it gives me something to do besides talk and it saves my voice.
so then at that point tim is tired of us chatting and says ""well, do you have a camera"" and i just turned around to him with this shocked look on my face and said ""ummm NO, YOU are supposed to have the camera!!"" (and apparently i said it kind of loud and kinda mean, cause hi, i was nervous!!) and kelly died laughing and said ""she's like, dude, i just want my picture!"" so then brian had to explain to him no no she's from fan club (cause i was the first one and apparently the clay ppl were special and had their own cameras) SO then tim ran around like a chicken with his head cut off to find the camera. in the meantime i showed her rach's picture that i had brought and said i wanted you to sign this but mean tim wont let you...so i will just show it to you. and of course she was AMAZED and said ""wow, you can even see my sweat!"" and the color is so wonderful. then we talked about trey and how he should be taking my picture instead of dumbass..and kelly said well trey got promoted to backup singer, so he's doing that now. 

then we took the picture (yes dumbass finally found the camera) which will probably come out horrible knowing my luck. and that was it. she hugged me again and said thank you so much and i went over to brian to get my pocketbook and then she said ""BYEEEEEE!"" like she always does and i said thank you and left. i felt so dumb, cause the whole time i didnt know what to say to her! and i really had so many things to say to her...LOL. then i walked out to the car where rach was and i was smiling so big and i got in the car and said ""i just met kelly"" and she laughed and said ""Ummmm, I KNOW! renee, you are so retarded!"" then she laughed some more. then she (being retarded herself) drove to my house WITHOUT THE HEADLIGHTS ON!! and she calls me retarded! (sorry i just had to include that) SO....theres my meet and greet. it wasnt eventful or uneventful, i dunno. it just kinda flew by, thats all i know to say.

<lj-cut text=""EVEN THE BEST FALL DOWN SOMETIMES"">Family, friends, fellow soldiers mourn Sgt. Brown killed in Iraq 
By Amelia A. Pridemore/Register-Herald Reporter

 
A full military Honor Guard procession carries the casket of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jeremy Brown, who died in Mosul, Iraq, after a Humvee rollover, to graveside during his funeral Friday at Blue Ridge Memorial Gardens. (C.L. Garvin/The Register-Herald)  
 
  



 
 
Even though it was soaked with rain, the American flag at half staff still flew at Blue Ridge Funeral Home.

And even though eyes of the people inside were soaked with tears, they still stood to honor a soldier, comrade, husband, father and hero.

U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jeremy Alexander Brown, 26, of Mabscott, died July 3 in Mosul, Iraq, after a Humvee rollover. He was assigned to the 66th Military Intelligence Company of the 3rd Armored Calvary, and he had served in the Army since 1996. His funeral was conducted at Blue Ridge Funeral Home Friday afternoon, and he was buried at Blue Ridge Memorial Gardens.

Brown was the son of Teresa Lynn Scott Brown and the late John Alexander ""Skeet"" Brown, who died just five years ago of cancer. His father was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the Vietnam War. He had two brothers, Jason, his twin, and Greg. Brown graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1997.

He and his wife Rosemary, of West Orange, N.J., married about three years ago after they met while they were both serving in the Army in Korea. He was also the father of a 3 1/2-year-old son, Seth Alexander Brown, of Winchester, Ohio.

Upon entering the funeral home, visitors were able to see a collage of photos from Brown's life - his wedding day and a photo of taking Seth to a petting zoo were included.

Maj. Gen. John F. Kimmons of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, along with other comrades, was on hand to stand for Brown, a fellow intelligence soldier. Kimmons' son has done two tours of Iraq and one of Afghanistan. Brown was on his second tour of Iraq when he died.

Kimmons highly complimented the work of young soldiers like Brown, and ones enlisting after Sept. 11, 2001, when they knew they would be serving in wartime.

""They have chosen to march to the sound of a gun,"" he said. ""What I have seen really reflects the talent, patriotism and leadership of these youngsters. They are in the harshest of environments in Iraq, and after they get back from a trip over there, they're as high as a kite. They do fantastic stuff there, and the morale is good, even though they're often in danger.

""It's a privilege and an honor to serve with them.""

As mourners entered the chapel, fellow soldiers stood by at the doorway. One of these men, trained to fight, struggled to hold back tears. During the service, Army representatives presented Brown's family with a Bronze Star and the Army Commendation Medal.

""The military doesn't give Christmas bonuses, it just gives small pieces of ribbon - but these are pieces of the heart,"" Kimmons said. ""This is for Rosemary, Seth and Mrs. Brown, his family... but we represent Jeremy's other family, the Army family. Even though it's a big place, it's tightly knit. He was a superb intelligence leader in one of our finest, proudest units.""

Army representatives read statements from his fellow soldiers. They described a man who took care of his comrades, and always set high standards for them to follow, never allowing them to give up at anything. They also described a man with a good sense of humor, who always took the time to have general conversation with them.

Even when he was fatally injured, they told, he only asked about the status of his fellow soldiers.

""To Jeremy Brown, to his family, to his fellow soldiers, to all soldiers of all ranks in the whole nation, thank you for a job well done,"" Kimmons said. ""God bless Jeremy Brown, God bless his family and God bless America.""

Representatives from Gov. Joe Manchin's office attended, reading an executive order declaring that all flags at state offices be flown at half staff on Friday, the day Brown was buried.

Pastor Bobby Meadows remembered more than a solider. He remembered a 6-year-old boy making the decision to be baptized. When he was baptized at Tildon Community Church that day, Jeremy was held up so others could see him because he was so short at the time.

Meadows taught Brown's youth class at church for eight years - and was also Midway native U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Jeff Taylor's principal at Independence High School for three years. Taylor, a 30-year-old Navy SEAL, died June 28 in eastern Afghanistan when a helicopter he was riding in crashed into a mountain ravine. It was apparently hit by a Taliban rocket-propelled grenade. His memorial service was held Sunday.

""There's no finer young people and no finer families,"" he said of both the Browns and Taylors.

As the mourners poured out of the funeral home, ready to drive to the cemetery, the rain had stopped. The sun shone brightly for a while as cars filed into the cemetery, where the roads were lined with American flags.

Brown's casket, draped with an American flag, was transported by a U.S. Army Military Honor Guard. As it was moved into and from the hearse that took Brown to his final resting place, soldiers slowly saluted.

Brown's gravesite was located near several others who had served in the military - and directly to the right of his father's.

After performing his graveside rites, his honor guard methodically folded the flag that had draped his casket, making sure every last fold and crease were perfect. His Army Solider Escort described, with each fold, the significance of each. This flag was presented to his wife, and another was presented to his mother.

During the service's final prayer, the wind kicked up a notch. A dove, when released from a basket, flew right beside Brown's casket and his family gathered alongside.

Then as mourners gradually left the gravesite for their cars, Brown's son Seth stood beside his father's casket, waving an American flag as high as his tiny arm could reach.

"event","i'm back home, i'm back homeeeee. Halleujah and thank the good Lord in heaven! i have never been so happy to be back home. this has been one of the most trying weeks of my life. but more on that later.

ok i need to update cause its my baby's birthday today! i cant believe he's already 3 years old. TIME FLIES. no joke. alright here are my quotes for today since its my baby boys birthday.


""To have a child is to accept that your heart will forever walk outside of your body""

""Children are the proof that we have been here,  they are the best thing and the most impossible thing, but there's nothing else.  Life is a riddle, and they are the answer. If there's an answer, it has to be them.""  ~Alison Pearson, I Don't Know How She Does It

nothing that i say is going to explain his presence in my life. my child is just a precious, THE most precious, gift from God.  I thank God every day for that child and will continue to. i have spent the whole entire week with him (granted mainly chasing him around, but still) and it has been the most joyful expierence. it will be hard for me to go back to work on monday and leave him again. he is just so cute. i could sit here and list all the cute little things, but yeah we'd be here all day. but wait, i have to tell just one lol. the other day i was getting dressed for the funeral and he pulled on my skirt and said ""Mama, Mama, are you a princess?"" Ahhh, he's so cute!

Anyways, on another subject, this week has been absouletly an unbeievable mess.I spent the week with my family b/c of my cousins death, theres so many stoires, but i will have to update on that later. i am just getting home and trying to get everything straight from being gone for so long. i am just so happy to be home in my own house and hopefully everything will settle down soon. 
Anyway, more from me later. LOVE YA'LL!"

<lj-cut text=""SGT Jeremy A Brown""> Mabscott family mourns soldier killed in Iraq 


 
Sgt. Jeremy A. Brown  
 
  



 
 
Jeremy Brown remembered for dedication to son, service

By Amelia A. Pridemore/REGISTER-HERALD REPORTER

While she watched her grandson play, Teresa Brown remembered how his father would sacrifice anything for his son - and for the soldiers with whom he served.

U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jeremy A. Brown, 26, of Mabscott, died Sunday when a Humvee rolled over in Mosul, Iraq, Army representatives confirmed. Brown was assigned to the 66th Military Intelligence Company of the 3rd Armored Calvary.

""He said, 'Mom, I have a job to do. ... My men are only 18- and 19-year-old boys, and I have to go over and protect them. I know that I have to go for my men',"" his mother recalled when he was preparing in February to return for a second tour in Iraq.

""I told him, 'I understand. We'll be waiting for you when you get home.'""

Losing Jeremy has been especially hard on the family, his brother Jason said, because their father died just five years ago.

John Alexander Brown, was exposed to Agent Orange during Vietnam, and died of cancer.

Jeremy and his wife Rosemary married about three years ago. They met when they were both serving in the Army in Korea. Jeremy also has a 31/2-year-old son, Seth, and another brother, Greg, 21.

Jason, also 26, is his twin.

""He's only been in the world about four minutes less than I have,"" he said. ""It's been pretty rough.""

Jeremy was a 1997 graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School who entered the Army right after graduation. While they were growing up, Jason said he and Jeremy hung out in different crowds most of the time, but after he joined the military, they spent more quality time together when Jeremy came home on leave.

They especially loved target practice and riding four-wheelers.

""We're both very stubborn,"" Jason joked. ""We don't give in to peer pressure. We both have very strong character, and we never were easily influenced.""

Teresa said her son really grew up after joining the Army. His father told him he would be aching to come home after time in basic training. Even though he realized his father was right, after the basic training, Jeremy found his calling.

""He said, 'I'm good at what I do, I enjoy this, and this is my job.'""

However, Jason said Jeremy grew up even more considerably when he became a father.

""Everything in the world stopped when it came to [Seth].""

Teresa said her favorite memory of her son is when he laid eyes on his son for the first time. Shortly after Seth was born, Seth's mother was becoming depressed because Jeremy was not around. Little did she know, Jeremy was on his way.

""You could just see that awe in his face when he saw his son,"" she said. ""... That's the standout of all.""

Besides being a man who would do anything in the world for his son, Teresa said Jeremy was a person who never met a stranger.

""He got along with everyone, and he was someone just everyone liked,"" she said.

His family emphasized that Jeremy loved what he was doing and believed in the cause for which he was fighting.

""He did agree with what we're doing in Iraq, and he did not like the negative media coverage,"" Jason said. ""He felt like we were doing much more good than bad. He saw families over there that thanked him. He got a lot of thanks from people over there.""

Judy Filipeck, Jeremy's maternal aunt, said concern for his son and the rest of his family drove Jeremy to do his job.

""'I do this so my baby will be safe and you guys will be safe over here,' is what he told me,"" she said.

Filipeck said the family always decorated the front porch with yellow ribbons for when Jeremy would come home. Their porch is decorated with them now.

Jeremy Brown is the second Raleigh County native killed while serving in the military in less than a week. On June 28, Petty Officer 1st Class Jeff Taylor, 30, a Navy SEAL and a Midway native, died in a helicopter reportedly downed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was one of 16 U.S. service members aboard.

Teresa Brown said her heart goes out to Taylor's family and those of other military families.

""I feel very sad for both of our families,"" she said. ""I wouldn't want anyone to go through this. ... I pray for all the families and all of the troops. What they're doing over there is not easy.""


- - -


Teresa Brown said her son was riding in the gunner's position on the Humvee and was killed instantly when it rolled on top of him and crushed him.

""We don't know how it flipped,"" Teresa Brown said. ""Everyone says that a staff sergeant isn't supposed to be a gunner, but Jeremy would have taken over any job and done it if his men were sick or injured.""

Brown was in Iraq for most of 2003 and part of 2004, then came back to the United States for a year. He returned to Iraq in February. Brown's mother said he was scheduled to leave the military in October 2006.

""It was shocking ... one of those things you never want to deal with."" She said she was comforted to know he didn't suffer. ""He would have never wanted to be captured or shot or come back home missing limbs.""

 
</lj-cut>


and on a completly and totally different note, there is this song that has been stuck in my head for days and will not go away. Lord knows I never ever thought a backstreet boys song would be stuck in my head (lord help me!)

""I tried to go on like I never knew you, I'm awake, but my world is half asleep, I've prayed for this heart to be unbroken, but without you all I'm going to be is Incomplete.""

dont ask me why i've just been feeling that way lately. kellys got this new song she's singing on tour and its called ""why"" and theres a part in it that goes ""and these are the contents of my head"" i love that song, but i always want to laugh hysterically at that part. cause just knowing all the contents of my head, lordy. i've just been thinking way too much lately, thats all. so if i could figure all the reasons why..that'd be great. doubt very seriously that i ever will.

anyways thats all from me for now. this will probably be my last entry before i go home to be with my family cause i think i am leaving tomorrow. so everyone take care!"

"event","well actually let me correct that previous post, i'm actually not going anywhere for a few days. shipping the body over was put off for a few days therefore the memorial service was put off for a few days. SO i am staying home for a few more days...(imagine that.) should have known the good ol US government loves to take its sweet time about things :/

i've been sick for the past two days though, so i guess its good that it was put off. i was in no condition to travel the way i felt. (bleh)

alright i have some super good news! I PASSED MY TEST. (everyone sigh and say finally!) HALLEJUAH AND THANK THE GOOD LORD ABOVE! i took another multiple choice which i made the highest score on again.....(odd how i do so good on those non-objective tests). but i made a passing score on the essays, so thats all i care about. YAHOOOOOO! so now i have about ohhhh 2 weeks to find a job LOL and one of those weeks i'm gonna be out of town. so good luck to me on that one, right?

alright ya'll i'm out for now. LATER!"

added to that, we had a really really emotional church service yesterday. we learned in the middle of service that our associate pastor and another one of our members were on their way to the beach and was in a motorcycle accident. a car swerved into their lane and hit them head on, they werent even wearing helmets. pastor tony was airlifted to the hospital but we found out in the middle of the service that he didnt make it.

life is so precious. sometimes we get so involved with little things in life and we forget God gave us this precious life we live and he can take it away in a split second. in one second everything can change.

i'm out for now. ya'll take care."

"event","a long time ago i was really really into and addicted to aim, for a lot of different reasons, but one of them was because I loved to put quotes and stuff in my away messages. (i'm such a dork i know i cant help it.) anyways my point is that i really loved finding those quotes and having somewhere to put them and i'm hardly on aim anymore to even put up an away message, so i thought i'd start using those quotes here. i'll try to use one for each entry, maybe they will be of some interest, i dont know. 

so heres my quote of the day cause this is how i feel today lol.

""That's what i wanted: to be alone with myself in another world where truth 
is untrue and life can hide from itself.... it felt peaceful to be nothing 
more than a ghost within a ghost.""   -long day's journey into night

""now all thats left of me, is what i pretend to be, so together, but so broken up inside""

so heres my update. my little excursion out last night did not go as well as i would have liked. its so hard to explain, but it just felt soo intrusive. cause i was supposed to be going out kinda with just a bunch of friends but it turned into just a tad more than that, which made me uncomfortable. actually it made me want to run and hide. lol. the conclusion is that i'm not ready to date. i dont want to date. period. it was just like i had to sit there and pretend to be something that i'm not. and all the time i just wanted to run back to all these people who ALREADY know me so well. i'm so blessed by these people. and granted there are only a handful of people that i will even trust, especially now. i would probably say five or six at the most. and i simply dont WANT to trust anybody else. and even given those five or six, i can only think of one that i could tell completly everything to and have them understand. so thats really all i could think of last night. that and a million other thing kept running through my head, and i couldnt sleep and it was just ugh. i have no clue why this is coming up in my mind now lol. my mind is a strange thing, obviously. the funny thing about that is that the person is probably reading through this and wont even realize its them. (yep, so hows that for a wild secret?) but anyways the whole night last night was not a total waste. it was fun and i needed to go out and have fun so...eh its all good i guess.

i think also i may get to go to orlando next month, to universal. our sunday school class is going. lets hope i can come up with some money, cause i know that will be great fun! and kelly is coming up at the end of the month. i should get the tickets this week, i'm anxious to know about the seats. so we'll see. anyways i'm finished babbling for the time being. Peace ya'll!"

"event","i have some more profound wisdom to share (haha can you sense the sarcasm) i'm a little slow getting things sometimes, but you know what i've finally realized in 20 some odd years of living? (love the obscurity!)if something seems too good to be true, it usually is!

but like say you meet some friend for the first time. look at their life, look at their friends. if they dont have that many friends, THERES USUALLY A REASON FOR THAT! i'm usually the one that makes excuse after excuse and gives someone chance after chance, thinking i dont want to ""give up"" on being someones friend. if they dont have many friends, its probably NOT because person after person has treated them like crap, or that people dont understand them, or that its someone elses fault. HI, it could be just cause they themselves are a little CRAZY. (common sense, right?) sometimes, you really just need to listen to the people who have been there and done that before.

yes, i know this is totally random. but its my journal and no one reads it anyways! LOL

heres a quote from my sisters best friend i think is the greatest:

I learned that things change, people change. It doesn't mean you forget the past or try to cover it up. It simply means that you move on and treasure the memories. Letting go doesn't mean giving up, it means accepting that some things weren't meant to be. -- JessieLeigh

and with that thought, i'm moving on too (credit Rascal Flatts) PEACE!"

I DONT KNOWWWW! if i knew, i'd probably have the job, wouldnt I? so she said she'd check my references and call me. add that to the list of ALLLL the other things I'm waiting on. waiting on a job, waiting to buy a house, waiting to get a FREAKIN court date, waiting to get a divorce.....WAITING *sigh*

well on to more cheerful things. we went to the zoo the other day. i have some cute pictures. drew riding a horse, and some of the gorillas and giraffes (no, not mary from the fw zoo though) and elephants. i might post them here if i get time, or you could just go look at my online album, if you know where it is.

"event","so i have a few boring and pointless things to update with (LOL!) 

sadly enough in the month that i have not updated, only very few things have happened worth telling. and then there are other things that are sooo worth telling, but just cant be told ;) there are only a few people reading this that might understand :) the others will just have to die not knowing all my ""scandalous"" secrets (actually i just wish i had scandalous secrets)

ANYWAYS...i had a job interview last week. It went very well actually, I didnt do as bad as I thought i would. so i will hear if i got the job in two days. (i am counting) bad news though on that side is that i didnt pass that STUPID STUPID praxis test AGAIN. i'm not going into all the boring details on that, but lets just say they are screwing with me. i improved my scores on the individual essays and STILL got the same overall score. so back i go to pay another 300 dollars to take it again, fun times. it was depressing news, cause it just puts me off til the last minute on getting my certification and UGH. just bad. 
So lets move on...haha. my sister got back from ecuador yesterday. i was sooo worried about her! their country is in a bit of turmoil right now, and there were lots of protests and stuff like a month ago, so i'm glad she's back. she had a great great time, but also had some sad stories to tell. i know by her stories that we are truly truly blessed her in the united states. and she brought me some presents...jewelry and such. and some chocolate milk mix that is like gold to them...that is like their favorite treat there apparently (see i told you some stories were sad).
one more peice of sad (AND SCARY news) is that my one year of ""safety""  (so to speak) is apparently up.  that means that people are now trying to fix me up with their friends and so forth. i'm seriously like ahhhh NO! and people dont listen to me!! like my friend from church Melissa comes up to me this morning and starts talking about a friend she has, and i totally didnt see it coming that she was trying to set us up. but sure enough. ahhhhh! its SCARY. but yeah anyways i had to face it, it was bound to happen sometime. and also i got a call this week about my ten year reunion. sooo dont want to do that either. but we shall see. i have had such bad luck with relationships lately, and i mean friends and love and just everything. i kinda just want to hide for a while. whats so wrong with that?!?

but my motto on life lately: QUE SERA SERA. and with that, i'm out! PEACE!"

"event","i havent been updating this thing at all (shame on me) mainly cause i dont have anything to say.  however, today is sunday and i am WORKING and i am bored out of my mind. SO, i shall update.

when i said i didnt have anything to update with, i wasnt kidding. there is NOTHING, nothing, nothing. it has been almost 4 weeks since the court fiasco where andy and his lawyer showed up unprepared, and i still dont have another date. so the basics of it is, not only do i not have a divorce, i dont even have a damn court date. its gone beyond annoying. i've yet to figure out if its andys idiot lawyer who is dragging his feet or my lawyer. *sigh*

its not just the ""you are divorced"" statement i am waiting on.  umm how can i word this? i'm just saying its not the actual divorce that i am waiting on, theres more to it than that. until my court date there is no set visitation, so andy comes and goes with my son as he pleases, he comes and goes through my house as he pleases, he comes and goes through my mail as he pleases...the list could go on. his harrassment is just unbelievable. i mean the other day he told me he was going to call DSS and send me to jail. for someone who hates me so much, he sure seems to be around bugging me enough. so anyways,  i cant get set visitation until the court date, i cant find another house until the court date.  its frustrating.  honestly, its to the point where i just want to shut down...just not think about ANYTHING anymore. unfourtantely, there is this thing called a life that i am forced to live.  so que sera sera. here i am living my life, oh yipee. 

i'm just very depressed lately, can anyone tell? haha. sorry to be so gloomy, but things are just BLEH right now. tough times. so anyways, theres a kelly concert coming up in the near future though. well thats something to be excited about. YAAAAY. fun times to come. maybe on my next update i will have fun stories to tell. until then, PEACE!"

"event","oh, everybody fall over in shock, i am updating.

well really, i am just doing this for myself, so if any of you dont want to read this, haha i cant blame you! i'm just doing this to get my thoughts in order i guess. so here goes.

i have learned so much in this past year! soo sooo much.i cant begin to even think about all of it. one thing i've learned is i have ALOT of growing up to do! man, i have so much growing up to do. 
i have let people walk all over me for a good part of my whole entire life. and i am so sick of it. i've gone around and wondered what people will think of this if i do that, or what people will think of this, and based my life on it! that is total bullshit. from now on, what other people think they can just shove up their ass, cause i dont really care. starting first and foremost with ANDY himself. so number #1 most important thing i've learned is that andy is so stupid. and i used to think he just completly could rule the world. yes, that was truly a case of LOVE IS BLIND.
heres another thing that my sister sent me. I've learned a WHOLE lot from this too: 
Not everyone is healthy enough to have a front row seat in our lives.  There are some people in your life that need to be loved from a distance.  It's amazing what you can accomplish when you let go of, or at least minimize, your time with draining, negative, incompatible, not-going-anywhere relationships and friendships.
Observe the relationships around you. Pay attention! Which ones lift and which ones lean? Which ones encourage and which ones discourage? Which ones are on a path of growth uphill and which ones are going downhill?  When you leave certain people, do you feel better or feel worse? Which ones always have drama or don't really understand, know or appreciate you?  The more you seek quality, respect, growth, peace of mind, love and truth around you, the easier it will become for you to decide who gets to sit in the front row and who should be moved to the balcony of your life.

WORDS OF WISDOM RIGHT THERE. so thanks kimmie for that one!
i also like the analogy with the front row seats. see thats another thing i've learned. that you can be in the midst of a problem or even a really great situation, whatever, but you can make such a big deal out of NOTHING. and when you stop and think about it, and consider what it means in the long run...and it just means nothing. there are some things that are just so trivial in life, and i've made them important when i really shouldnt have.

so whats important? I thank GOD for his grace.  I thank HIM for giving me family and friends that listen to me. I thank HIM for giving me friends that give me advice that i dont even listen to (cause i'm too stubborn haha) and i thank HIM for giving them the patience to STILL be my friends when i dont listen. I thank HIM for blessing me with my child which is my whole entire life. And i just thank him for letting me hold on this long, hopefully I will be holding on for a while longer.

oh and maybe i should just update on the whole life situation. i went to court on tuesday. neither andy nor his lawyer were prepared, so they asked the judge to continue the case. which he did. i have to wait 3 more months to get a court date and to be officially divorced from the bastard. umm yes, life sucks.

well thats all of my drama for now. maybe i will continue my ""lessons learned"" stories at a later date (since we all know they are so moving *rolls eyes*) sorry guys, but i just wanted to write some things down to kinda clear my head. so thanks for reading if you did. PEACE! :)"

oh god, so much has happened since i updated this thing.  if i dont remember it all, check out my gj, i probably have it in there.

last saturday was the praxis, a teaching test i have to take. SEVEN FREAKIN HOURS of tests! i was about to die after that...ugh.  i pray to God i passed it. if not i'll have to take it again in june. it was seven straight hours of hell. 120 questions, 4 essays.

next..court date was moved up. i about freaked, its  APRIL 5. everything will be final then. and i will be freeeeeeee

she called me for my first sub job yesterday. high school, 10th grade. i'm very excited, that will be a good thing to throw out there on my interviews. nevermind that i was supposed to work that day for this stupid STUPID festival we have every year. i cannot miss barring a deathly illness....well, i'm faking a deathly illness, cause i cant miss this opportunity.

i was approved for my teacher certification. woohoo yay. now i gotta look for jobs. so yesterday i was working on my resume and cover letter to 15 different schools and my teacher app. stayed up all night to do that. so i'm good now.

thats it for now. besides i've been in a really good mood lately, well since yesterday actually. haha i guess thats not lately. i guess its been since my fast that i have just figured out alot of things.  i have had such a peace about my life though. i guess i should just say i am truly truly over the past and excited about what will come. and just to add, i'm not worried about being alone. so ha! theres a song by martina ""its a little scary, learning to fall""
so yeah, its scary, but i've found out, its ALOT of fun too!

alright enough about that, so, i dunno even why i am updating this thing, cause i am in the process of switching to greatest journal, since everyone is over there. but mine  doesnt have alot of graphics and stuff yet, so i dunno, i am just waiting i guess. this one doesnt have any graphics either, so whats my point? yeah, i dont have one.

ummmm....HAPPY VALENTINES DAY to everyone.  first time in 10 years that i have been ALONE on valentines day, and i made it through perfectly and completly fine! So basically I have come to the conclusion that yes, I am alone, and thats ok, because I do have Jesus, and he is someone that will NEVER fail me or leave me.  What a wonderful thought that is!  i came across a verse in my devotions, i think its the best verse: ""Break out into loud and joyous song, Jerusalem, for she who was abandoned has more blessing now than she whose husband stayed. For your Creator will be your ""husband"" (thats Isiah 54 if anyone cares) Thats good stuff right there, lol. Well I know people have been telling me of this concept for a while, and I'm sorry, but I am just SLOW to get things...SO SLOW. alright so i am going to sing since you been gone, i'm so movin on now, and totally get what it means.

"event","alright i'm updating...entertainment for the masses...awoohoo!

this week was a very good week for me.
alright first off, i have thrown myself into this teaching thing, and i'm pretty excited about it. i sent off my application for the program, i have already talked to the people in the office, so i should be approved with no problem. i applied to start substituting in fort mill, so i can start making some contacts there. i will do that on fridays, when i dont work at the library. THEN comes the hard part, i have to find a job.  I have to send my resume and stuff out and i've found out about a couple of job fairs. oh and lest i forget the OTHER hard part is taking the Praxis, which i'm really stressed out about.  its a hard test.  I payed 200 dollars to take it, I better not fail it! So i am studying like mad for that.

Alright, so its day 5 of the fast.  I'm reading some good stuff for my devotions. I am so ashamed of this story, BUT i will tell it haha. I was at my parents house eating dinner when my sister kim actually fixed me a glass of Coke and brought it over to me (if you know Kim then you know how STRANGE this is) so anyways i'm kinda out of it and just start drinking the coke, and then finally about 30 minutes later i REALIZE i am FASTING and should not be drinking it.  I felt so horrible when i realized it.  So, basics of the story is i'm probably going to hell, for breaking the fast. (alright i'm being sarcastic)

ummm what else? what else? i got my tax money back, thank GOD...so that means i can stop forcing myself to eat bologna sandwiches everyday..i actually have money.  theres a big conflict with that though, andys mad that i claimed the baby and all that, so i guess we'll see how that goes.  WHEN is there never any conflict anyways?
enough for now, i guess. oh if anyone has not heard this song by Martina (God's Will) i think its an AMAZING song, makes me cry, so listen to it, its good. Alright, i'm out. LATER!"

so whats going on with me? NOTHING really worth mentioning lol.

i am home sick from work today, another cold and i cant breathe and all that...bleh, and besides that my water is frozen, so no water. its soooo COLD here, its craziness!

i do have some good news i am kinda excited about, i know i have been telling everybody that i want to teach and cant seem to find a way to go back to school, being that i am a single mother with no babysitters and no money, but i found out about this program in SC called PACE, which means program for alternate certification for teachers. so basically what the program is, if you have a degree in a critical needs area (which english is) then you find a job and teach for three years and then they certify you! you have to take a few classes here and there along the way, three graduate courses, but i am excited, cause thats better than trying to keep my current job and find some way to take classes as well! so, it looks like thats good news if everything works out for me, its not going to be easy, but it looks alot LESS impossible now.  now, if i can just get a JOB maybe i will have enough money to move out of this crazy house and get on with my life. sounds like a plan to me!! :)

alright well enough updating for day, i gotta go and get ready for church tonight and i have to stop by work before that and work for a little bit. so later!

sooooo...i really have nothing to update about! life is the same old same old that it always will be i guess.
pastor preached a message today at church, (yeah todays sunday, i'm going to be super spirtual renee today) anyways he preached about standing strong and not letting the world effect you when everything else in it is going wrong. good message for me to hear! i try to keep that in mind every day that i wake up, its quite hard though.  very often reality gets the best of me,my circumstances get the best of me.
i remember a few months ago when i was talking to my sister in law, tara, and i was just talking to her about what i had just found out, what every one else knew for MONTHS, about andys little whore and all that jazz. see the whore (as i affectionatly call her) had been a friend of hers and so she knew what was going on, and after i found out about it on my own, i finally figured out everybody else knew.  so anyways though, she sat there and talked to me about it, tears running down my face, and she said to me, renee you are the strongest person i have ever met, and you will make it through this. WOW! i'm glad i give that kind of impression to people, b/c most of the time, let me tell ya, i'm not feeling it, lol. there are very few people in this world who actually get to see the REAL me, (ohh lucky them, right?) and i thank God for those people every day. too bad that they get to hear all my sadness and complaining though!
so whats my point? just that i guess i gotta keep reminding myself to stay strong, hopefully day by day i am getting stronger.  Its only by the gracious God in heaven that i am, and since i know that He is forever unchanging, hopefully good things are in store for me! we shall see...
peace out :)"

"event","ok, so i've had some complaints (umm ONE complaint) about my lengthy update, THEREFORE, i'm only going to post this one thing: 
my tribute to the new year, and here's hoping that 2005 is a hell of alot better than 2004! 
Happy New Year to everyone and God Bless!

I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on

I've lived in this place and I know all the faces 
Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on

I'm moving on 
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me 
And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyones life
When all you can see are the years passing by 
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

I've sold what I could and packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on"

"event","alright ya'll, heres my real update. like the subject line dont ya? LOL. baby drew and i had a really good christmas, i'm telling you, he really racked up on the gifts. theres something to be said about being a cute little kid! he got alot of stuff, and most of it is sitting in my living room, i dont mean to say that he got like a whole toy store full of stuff, cause for one my house is not all that big, and two some of the toys just take up alot of space. his favorite is the thomas the tank engine train set, you cant tear him away from that thing. he also got a basketball goal thingy, and thats in his room, i mean, what regular person has room enough for a basketball goal in their house. it probably should go outside, but its too cold out. its kinda like one of those borderline toys, it could go inside or outside, SO ANYWAYS... i know i'm talking about stupid stuff here, who cares about toys, right. i dont want to bore ya'll to death.

we really did have a great christmas, though. see the thing was, THIS YEAR, i wasnt obligated to go to this families house and that families house and here and there with andy.  so it was really SIMPLE this year, and i just tried to spend alot of time with the baby, and it was ALOT less stressful. and i think that is what christmas should be about. SIMPLE.  the best christmas present for me was that baby drew learned to sing Jesus Loves Me, isnt that PRECIOUS? he didnt learn it specifically for christmas, of course, but it happened to be he learned it a few days before. the bible says that you should train up a child in the ways that he should go, and he will not depart from it. GOD, i hope that is true! i'm trying my best! nevermind that the kid still thinks that a quarter is called JESUS, cause i give him a quarter every sunday morning for sunday school and tell him its for Jesus, well so now anytime he wants a quarter for candy or whatever, he yells JESUS JESUS! yeah, we got a little work to do on that one, i guess.

alright on to what i got for christmas i guess. ohh the DRAMA. well first of all, the little stuff i got, not much to mention, i got some towels and some pots and pans, and some clothes and my mother in law had a necklace custom made for me and my father in law even got me a gift, a day planner or something like that and my sister in law made me a beautiful bag for work, to carry books and stuff in. i was really surprised (and kinda uncomfortable) with the inlaws. Now for Andy, he got me a ring and a gift certificate, talk about uncomfortableness there! I DID NOT expect that at all...didnt see that one coming, i mean who would have thought? i want to scream GOD can my life not be SIMPLE??? reallly, its just a matter of questioning his intentions, he's so mysterious or sneaky about stuff, and so untrustworthy.  and its not a matter of he's trying to get me back or anything, of course not, but its just like is he trying to make me feel sympathetic b/c of court and stuff? i dunno.
if its the guilt thing, it can REALLY REALLY work on me, and he probably knows that. cause i know i have done some things that have really really hurt him, i cant imagine.  well, i mean some of those things are just in his head though, take for instance the fact he thinks i cheated on him, which i NEVER in my life did. i know what the pain feels like though, cause he actually DID do that to me. but still, i know he felt the hurt, even if it was just in his head, and for that, i do feel guilty and it upsets me MAJORLY.  the thing is, up until a certain point(that being this last year, i guess) andy has always held me to the most highest standards, with all his other faults, he really and honestly just thought i could do no wrong, and for me to know that is over, it devestates me. he knows how to work my nerves, i know i am going to have to get over it. theres more to it than that, with his behavior and i know it was beyond my control. so i will have to work on my guilt. and the fact is, he really did cheat on me, he's devestated my life beyond repair maybe, and also LETS his girlfriend just harrass me and rub stuff in my face all the time, and HE doesnt feel guilty for it.  so why should i? yet, i do have to hold myself to a higher standard though. enough about that, i just had to get that off my mind, sorry!

other news, my cousin had a baby boy yesterday! so thats cool, i hope to go see her this weekend maybe.  and my grandma came down, God, i love my grandma to death.  she brought me an apple pie, it had MY name on it and no one else was allowed to eat it, and lots of food and meat and stuff. my grandma takes care of me! the thing about family is they always think about you, no matter how long its been since you've seen them, and you never EVER can get rid of them (LOL) 
news about my house is...andy has been turned down 2 times for refinancing, and i was hoping he would take over the house, since its in my name and i could leave that place. the thing with me and andy is he's always around, comes in and out as he pleases, cause its his families house, and I NEED TO GET AWAY!! so guess whats going to happen. either i sell the house out from under him and cause a big HUGE mess and heartache (which is what he deserves) or sit in the house and keep it for him, me suffering all the while so i cant do my own thing. yeah, as you guessed probably the last one is going to happen. SUCKS doesnt it?

hmmm what else? want to know what i am reading lately? rach got me back into reading, i'm so excited, i havent read anything in like a year or two. that seems like a mistake to say, doesnt it, that RACH got me back into reading. well anyways, i am reading ALOT of stuff all at one time, boring stuff i am reading is stuff like ""How to Hear God"" and ""Healing Damaged Emotions"" and a book called ""Single, Married, Separated, and Life after Divorce"" alright so those are the boring ones. I am also reading one about a woman whos husband cheated on her and left her the other woman, and so now she is plotting to kill him! Good subject right? its called ""Little Bitty Lies"" its great! very funny. and then i am reading the Shopaholic series which is also just hilarous, i read those books and just want to roll in the floor laughing. so good times there.
the single married blah blah book is for my 40 day fast.  i will go ahead and tell ya'l about that now.cause appearently when you are IN a fast, you are not supposed to be a pity whore and complain about it OR tell anyone about it! appearently, that defeats the purpose of trusting God to get you through the situation (LOL) note: God doesnt want you to complain during a fast!so i'm being a pity whore now, it doesnt count if i'm not on the fast yet? :) i'm giving up caffeine this time, that means NO Dr Pepper, Mt Dew, Sweet Treats (the coffee shop) NOTHING! oh, i will probably DIE! and thats the last of my pw act

so, i'm out now, hope ya'll have enjoyed this long informative crap i just typed! Later!"

"event","ok, so i did come back and update before christmas didnt i? miss allison has been telling me ""you need to update!"" for a couple of days, but i promise you guys did not want any udates from me in the last few days, i have been ugggggh, terribly moody...you would have gotten some updates full of rage and terrible words, SO..haha! be glad i didnt update.

SO.....hey look! i got my new since you been gone avatar, and it is just LOVELY, see that smirk on her face that says hahahahaha, i got you back? oh i do so love it!

alright, now concerning christmas presents, let me report to you what my most wonderful best friend got for me: a friends dvd, a raggedy ann porcelain collectors doll (cause i collect them, duh) and umm a rascal flatts cd (yay!) and a really pretty purple sweater that i wore to work already and everybody was like ohhhhhh renee, you look just so pretty. well they were probably lying about me being pretty lol, but i have to say the sweater is very pretty. ok and then for baby drew, he got a care bears dvd, and a disney game and a learning board. ummm i think thats all, sorry if i forgot something. so BIG HUGE thanks to allison, the girl thinks she's santa claus or something. since she knew that my christmas was going to be really sucky, she was looking out for me and got me the greatest gifts, she's always looking out for me, thats why i love her to death! what a great best friend i have!
other gifts i have gotten already, ummm i gotta remember, well the girls at work got me a gift certificate to my favorite coffee shop, and that was AWESOME and then Laura gave me some godiva hot chocolate mix, which i think i will just DIE when i drink that stuff, i know its going to be good, and then even better, i gotta put some baileys in it. OH LORDY! Laura also gave baby this scooby doo christmas stocking he is just in love with, when he first saw it, he kissed it, it was the cutest thing ever. and it sings too, so he started dancing with it. he's a crazy child!
ummmmm.....what else shall i write?? haha, i am trying to avoid writing about the REAL issues of life, cause thats what i do, pretend like its not happening, i guess thats a good thing maybe? nah i guess maybe not, cause i always let it all build up, and you know whether i pretend like its happening or not, ITS STILL HAPPENING (newsflash for me) so i should just face up to it, and get on with life (sorry, that was a little peptalk i just gave myself)lately i am just really really tired of andy going out and doing anything that he wants to do (ok namely fucking his little whore, oh did i say that OUT LOUD??) anyway, i am tired of sitting at home and worrying about stuff and pretending like everything is just wonderfully ok. I AM VERY TIRED OF PRETENDING! everyone say, oh things will work out, give it time, he will get what he deserves, but YEAH thats just not happening for me. so the other day i was frustrated, i am doing better about it now. it would help if the whore wouldnt be immature and just STUPID and quite harrassing me and rubbing stuff in my face, but i guess who am i to say who she can harrass. i mean hell, if she wants to be stupid, i guess yeah, let her go live her life and be stupid, i just wish she wouldnt include me in on all of it. but whatever, i changed my s/n so maybe that will help some.

you may wonder why i am doing all this ranting and raving at the moment. well the truth is its wed before the holidays and everyone is out shopping, NOT in the library, and it is COMPLETLY DEAD in this place. so trying to occupy my time, its a good thing!

hey guess what?? I STILL HAVE NOT WRAPPED PRESENTS. its really sad i know, you people just dont know though, i hate it.  and i dunno when i will have time to do it, me and kimmie are going out to the mall tomorrow i think, and then i might even get her to go to the movies, to see MEET THE FOCKERS, oh i cant wait to see that movie! 

alright, WELL, peace out ya'll, i'm gonna stop rambling here. everyone have the most merriest of christmases cause i know i wont be able to update i'll be too busy, but i'll come back and tell all about the wonderful presents i got *rolls eyes* later!

oh and ps...that star down there, yeah thats really what i feel like. LOL!

One more thing...HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY JESSIE!!!! LOVE YOU BUNCHES JESS"

"event","I stole this from Rach, because i am at work and bored out of my mind! Lets just see how different my answers can be from rach's, I'm sure they'll be a world of difference!

I guess i should do a little update here too, and say that CHRISTMAS is almost here, but i'm DONE with my shopping and now i have to wrap all my presents up! (bleeeeeh) I hate wrapping presents.
And also, to display his wonderful holiday cheer, andy has decided to be an ass about the whole child support/custody crap, so i guess we are going back into court again, I REALLY REALLY HATE the turmoil.
stresses me out.

props to allison for my wonderful kelly blend that she made all by herself, i think it just beautiful! now, when christmas is over and i get my SINCE U BEEN GONE one, i'll be good to go! cause thats my song, and in the video, that look she gives after she trashes that girls house ahaha! thats just classic

oh also, let me tell you what me and my brilliant self did on friday...i left my wallet just laying there at the checkout counter in walmart for everyone to see...didnt realize it until dinner that night when i went out to eat and couldnt pay for my food! then i looked all over and finally called walmart and they were like ohhh yes, we have it.  now how stupid can i be, to leave my wallet with my id, all my credit cards laying in the walmart? well, at least i got it back though. 

Ok, so i'm going, peace out, and if i dont update before christmas, then everyone have a very very wonderful christmas and God Bless!

"event","ok heres a little story for ya, so i am at home and trying to walk over to arlenes house to talk to her and baby drew is running all over the place like his usual wild self, when the girl who lives in the rental house comes walking across the yard. she says hello to me, but i dont hear her cause i am watching baby drew and then running across the yard before he darts out into the road (i mean imagine that, me having my mind on my child instead of a passerby person) so anyways, i go up to her after i get baby drew and she says to me ""i always say hey to you and you never speak"" LIKE I'M STUCK UP OR SOMETHING.  i mean, come on people, who could call me stuck up? as rach says, i am ""really really nice"" (haha, i LOVE to quote rach, with her infinite wisdom) i really didnt purposely ignore the girl, and i felt so bad that she accused me of that, i dont want to appear like a stuck up person.  i just have so much on my mind lately, i can only do so much at one time. and then all the paranoid people like this girl want to add to my problems and be like ""ohhh why dont you speak to me"" so as i said, i felt bad, so i went into the house and baked her some cookies, just to prove that i am really a nice person. and i wrote her a note about how i was sooo sorry, but i just had so much on my mind so you know what, i hope she feels bad now! theres a little psychology lesson there for ya. and yeah i know i'm a little crazy but haha i don't care.  she should feel bad though, i mean really. calling me stuck up!
ok i need to thank my best friend in the whole world, miss allison, for setting up this journal for me so i can make pointless rants such as these.  allie's always looking out for me, so thanks allie!"

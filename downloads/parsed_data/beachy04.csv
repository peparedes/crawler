"event","Okay, so here's the truth: voting is not really all that exciting. I mean, you go into a little room, get your ID checked by a bevy of geriatric volunteers (so nice and so cute -- I love old people), and then stand at a computer for ten minutes. It's boring, really. 

But what's exciting is everything that comes after: the endless conversations on CNN and FoxNews about who will take control of the House and the Senate, how the last two years of the Presidency will go, and most importantly -- the end of those stupid recorded messages that always end up interrupting something.

As a young person, I'm always being told that voting is something I should do -- that my vote can change the world. It's really, really easy to become cynical, because a lot of politicans ignore the young people (even though they don't mind us going to fight overseas). I can't even count the number of times I've seen a political ad and thought, ""What's it matter? Whatever's going to happen will happen.""

Look -- I don't know if my vote will honestly change anything. And I'm positive there were no streamers and trumpets when I walked out of the voting center. But what i do know is that for the rest of the day, I'm going to wear my ""I VOTED"" sticker and when the results come in -- no matter what the outcome -- I'll know that I didn't sit and accept whatever comes my way. I went out and did something. And that, for me, is what's exciting."

"event","Well, first, I recieved a wonderful scene-tique from Cynthea. Let me tell you: it is everything people say it is, and more. She was so dead on with her notes and she cut through all of my writer crap and got to the soul of the scene. I am amazed. She is so great.

Now, on to something a littler more difficult: I joined an online critique group about two months ago. After my first submision, I recieved a few nice critiques and then a scathing (but helpful) one. The scathing critique basically ended with: ""i didn't really like it all all, but I don't like a lot of modern literary (here the person meant non chick-lit) fiction for teens."" 

So -- this month I submitted. And almost everyone else has gotten a critique back -- except for me. I thought at first it might be an email problem -- I even emailed the moderator, but no -- everything sent out fine. So now I'm thinking that the poeple in my group hate what i wrote so much they dread even having to read it and try to critique. Which leaves me in a mess. 

I like the critique group. I like having a deadline every month to work for. I like reading what everyone else is writing and trying to help. I like hearing outside comments.

But for awhile now I've been thinking this group is not right for me. I don't fit in, for whatever reason. So -- LJ friends - can you help? Should I try to talk to the moderator? Should I just tell the moderator I want to leave the group? Should I try to stick it out? I don't know what is the right thing for me to do. 

Any help -- any -- would be great."

"event","I am currently taking an adolescent lit. class, and today we were on the subject of summer homework. One lady in my class, Lisa, who is a mother of two and currently working as teacher while she finishes up her graduate studies, relayed this to us: 

Her son, in the sixth grade, was assigned a novel to read over the summer. In the climax of the novel the boy is out in a field picking blueberries, gets stung by a bee and dies. ""Don't read it, it's terrible!"" she warned us, shaking her head as if she couldn't believe it had ever been assigned. According to the description Lisa gave, the entire book was focused on the scene in the field. I find this hard to believe -- 150 pages of one scene? No doubt there is more to the book, but as people often do when they are trying to make a point, Lisa only reported the truth as she wanted to see it. 


Lisa walked in on her son sobbing on the couch as he finished the novel. The teacher was unaware that Lisa's son was, in fact, allegic to bee stings, and could die from one attack. ""Now he's afraid to go outside. It's all I have to do just to get him to go into school in the morning,"" she said. ""They can't even get him outside for recess.""

Lisa is a take-charge type of mother, and instantly complained to the school, wanting the teacher to be punished in some way (for not knowing ahead of time her son was allergic) and the book to be removed from the classroom. 

Now, I feel sympathetic to Lisa and her son. It's a shame that he had such a traumatic reading experience and that he is now afraid to even go outdoor. However, I wanted to ask some questions:

Did Lisa's son know he was allergic to bee stings? If so, why didn't he feel some sort of kinship with the main character? Or did he just know if he got stung he would die? What had she told him before this point? Why did he react so strongly? (It all seemed a little suspicious to me). . .

To me, Lisa's son's reaction is more than a little too extreme, and a result of her lax parenting skills (and please tell me if I'm wrong): why in her right mind would Lisa tell her son he is allergic to bees and could die? Why wouldn't she give him a safety net, make a plan so he could remain calm instead of being paralyzed with fear. ""If a bee is around, here's what you should do. . ."" ""If you get stung by a bee, here's what you need to do. . ."" Give him a plan to fall back on. Instead of throwing your arms around him and telling him he will always be safe, give him a sense of control over the situation. 

When he read the book (and what kind of working English teacher doesn't know what her own son is reading? Am I wrong to assume that any parent should at least have a passing interest in what their child brings home?) and became so upset by it, why didn't Lisa take the time to discuss what happened to the character. ""What should he have done?"" she could have asked. ""What would you do?""

I'm really opinionated (obviously) about people trying to ban books, and this just seemed like a perfect example. This teacher undoubtedly feels a sense of shame over terrifying a young child, Lisa is upset, her son is paralyzed with fear, and to me it seems like it could all have been avoided. 

I don't know. It's hard to speak clearly right now. i feel all fired up about this. If anyone has anything to say (and please feel free to disagree -- i would love to hear some new ideas about this, honestly), please leave a comment."

"event","Yesterday I found out Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, died. I was staying at my sister's house while she was out of town, and when she returned in the morning, she told me. I wondered how it could have happened, thinking (like most people did, I'm sure) ""He finally got too close to one of his 'little buddies.'"" 

No, I was informed, he died from an attack by a sting ray. Which is almost a little too surreal to even fully consider. Stingrays have long pointed tails (I'm sure of this -- I've been to the zoo many times) but I'd actually never considered that the spears would be used in some way, least of all to actually harm someone. 

Later, it was reported that the medics removed the stingray's spear from Irwin's chest, and I was reminded of what I was told many times during my youth: after a bee stings a person, the yellow-and-black striped creature dies. So it was only logical to assume the stingray must have also died. And while I'm not actually sure if stingray's are endangered, I would guess they are, and so the death of Irwin, coupled with the death of the stingray, is a tragedy. 

Of course, I do not mean to triviliaze anyone's death. When I was younger, I would watch ""The Crocidile Hunter"" with my family. We were not really interested in the animals as much as the almost-suicidal behavior of the host, Mr. Steve Irwin, and his lovely wife, Terry. 

Somehow, the way those things do, ""The Crocodile Hunter"" dissapeared from television, being replaced by Caesat, The Dog Whisperer and Mario Lopez on World's Most Talented Pets. Irwin made the news a few years later when he appeared on Australian television, holding his baby son in one arm and enticing an alligator with the other. The American news organization went into an uproar, as usual, more concerned with one celebrity's handling of their child than the millions of hungry and neglected children in our own country. Experts in everything from child care to animal handling were brought in to give their expert opinions on Irwin's abilities as a father. But, soon, the whole matter was forgotten, and Irwin dropped off the American map once again.

As more news broke about Irwin's death, I found out he had been killed while filming a television special on aquatic life. My first thought was: ""He's still on t.v.?""

Dumbly -- as only an American can -- I had not considered that Irwin's television career, though over in the U.S., was still going strong abroad. I realized I had just assumed Irwin and Terry and their two children were living in Australia on an alligator farm of some sort. Irwin would always wear his trademark khaki shirt and shorts and Terry would just laugh the way she always did, not even batting an eye when she saw her husband put his hand inside a crocodile's mouth or let a snake grip around his arm. Whatever I considered, it was not a continued career on television. 

Truth be told, I had not thought about Steve Irwin in many years. Sure, he had been a star in his own right for some time, but America seems to have a revolving door of celebrity, and Irwin was on the far side of the door, out of sight. 

Of course, his death brought him back into the light. The news last night was littered with his friends, speaking fondly of his heoric efforts. His television specials and shows were shown back-to-back on the Animal Planet television channel. Blogs around the world were updated as everyone remembered Irwin, and how he had somehow touched their lives. 

I do not mean to be pessimistic, but I find it vaguely insulting. If we could go back a day, before the news of Irwin's death broke, how many people across America would be watching his show, or looking up his picture on the Internet, calling their friends to remember some crazy stunt he did?

America has its own, unique way of mourning, I suppose. We don't care about someone unless they die, and then we remember how great they were, how much their words and actions touched us. It is better, I guess, to be late in our affection than to never show any compassion at all. 

Now, in a time when America has invaded other countries and we have sent our troops to foreign soil, forcing people my age to make life or death decisions, I think everyone can learn something from Steve Irwin's death. Now, more than ever, as a young person in this country, the future seems balanced on a pin, ready to roll either way. Who knows what tomorrow may bring: An attack by foreign terrorists? A stabbing by a sting ray? Or some semblance of peace in the world? 

Nothing, we should remember, is ever certain. If today is our last day, may we all be remembered as Steve Irwin is: as a good person, alway trying to do the best we can, looking ahead to the future with a baby under one arm, battling the crocodiles with the other, glad every second to be alive."

"event","Today I was talking to a girl I knew in high school. We weren't really friends or anything, and I won't pretend to say I know her all that well right now, either. In high school she was categorized as goth/ alternative girl, though it simply meant that she wore Converse sneakers before Avril Lavigne took them mainstream and she wore  a vintage dress from the fifties to prom.

Now, if this were a teen movie, someone (a popular girl or a decently handsome boy) would have noticed Lucy for the individual she is and helped her become cool. Lucy's other friends, the alterna-goths, would become resentful of Lucy's newfound fame. but in the end, Lucy would remember where she came from and everyone would co-exist happily together. The end scene of the movie would be the popular girl showing up to school with her hair dyed pink like Lucy's, or the popular boy shaving his head into a mohawk for prom, where he would undoubtedly sweep up Lucy in the spotlight and they would share one magical -- choreographed to the last step -- dance. 

But life is not a teen movie, and, as Lucy as I remembered today: ""High school sucked."" It did. And we came to the agreement that anyone who disagrees, who says high school was the best time of their life, or says the dreaded, ""I would do it all over again"" was surely one of those mean people who made high school a hellish existence. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I had some great times in high school. I met lots of great friends and laughed more than I was upset, but I would not go back and do it for anything.

(And when I say ""one of those mean people"" I mean the kids who thought they were so much better than everyone, or felt a glimmer of pride if they talked to someone like Lucy and me, as if we were charity cases and it was an honor for us to be graced with such a conversation. 

And if you're sitting there thinking: but not every popular person was mean, you're right. If you're thinking, I had friends from all sorts of groups and I was popular, think again. Someone hated you. Someone resented you. You made fun of someone, not in an evil way, but just in passing. But to that person it meant a lot. So deal with the facts: you were a mean kid.)

We talked about senior year, when Lucy made it on prom court, though she ended up losing to a pretty, popular cheerleader, who was also black (because if we elected a black prom queen, we were being progressive -- forget those cliches about racist Ohio). Lucy and the others were all lined up and paired off, and told to dance. But her date left her standing alone. He went off to be with his girlfriend. Which is fine - except that all the other girls were dancing with their partners. Even Lucy's nomination was handled like a joke. 

She's not bitter about it, though. She looks back on the whole thing as a funny story to recount, a way to validate her notion that high school does, indeed, suck. 

It was cool, I guess I'm trying to say, listening to her anf talking and knowing that high school is not the end all, be all it's sometimes trumped up to be. It is what it is, and in the end, you look back at what happened and you thnak God for your friends and the really good memories, and then you turn your back to it all and keep stepping foward. You take one step and then the other and you don't worry about what used to be. It's all about what is, and what will be."

"event","Lately, I have been setting off the alarms in stores when I come in and go out. For example, this morning on a trip to Target, I set off the alarm coming in. So I shopped with hesitation, knowing that when I left, the alarm would go off agin and I would have that one moment of sinking humiliation. And sure enough, when I left, the alarms went off. Now, even better was the expression of the elederly lady walking behind me. She literally looked shocked, as if 1) she couldn't believe someone as nice looking as me would steal and 2) she had a brief struggle in her midn of whether or not she should get involved. What she would do is beyond me -- take a flying leap and tackle me? Beat me down with her ugly granny purse? I'm not sure. But. . .

So then I head to Barnes and Noble and sure enough. . . Beep! Beep! So, again, I shopped with terror, knowing when I left the alarms would go off. Fifteen minutes pass and I am walking out with some coffee (i know -- I have become that pathetic college student who walks around Barnes and Noble with a Starbucks coffee -- I am a corporate brand whore, i guess) when the alarms go off. The doors are right by the row of registers, so I stepped back (setting off the alarms again) and said to the nearest clerk: ""The alarms went off. I didn't steal anything."" Which was obvious. For once I did not buy any books, All I had was the coffee. 

And get this: the guy shrugged and waved me through. He didn't even look up, like it was a normal occurance. So I started to wonder what exactly set off the alarms. To the best of my non-Nancy Drew skills, I was able to deduct that the most likely suspect was my flash drive, which I carry around on my keychain (warning: this is another sign of a dorky college student). 

But I use my flash drive and like to keep it handy? Is it worth the embarassment? I do not know. 

Driving home, thinking back on the casual way the clerk had shrugged me off, I started to wonder if the alarms perhaps meant something else. logically, this makes no sense, but think how cool it would be if alrams at the front of stores went off whenever someon good looking or worthy of attention stepped through the doors. 

Then I'd be okay with my beep beep-ness. In fact, I would welcome the sound, as long as everyone knew that the sound was not to indicate a theif (which I am clearly not) but a VIP. 

(Okay. now I must go throw up from the cheesiness of this all. Forgive me.)"

1. One book that changed your life. 

Look at Me by Jennifer Egan. Amazing.

2. One book you've read more than once. 

Many many books have been read repeatedly. I especially love Upstream and Swollen by Melissa Lion more and more each time I read them. 

3. One book you would want on a desert island. 

I'm going to have to copy Sarah Dessen and choose Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. It sounds good, but I don't think I have the strength to lug that whole book around. 

4. One book that made you laugh. 

Crash Diet by Jill McCorkle.

5. One book that made you cry. 

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Johnathan Safran Foer. The end of the novel was about as good as it gets for me.

6. One book you wish had been written. 

Either Catalyst by Laurie Halse Anderson (the most perfectly structured novel I've ever read) or Lost In the Forest by Sue Miller (I never reached a point in the novel where I noticed Miller was writing -- the story just flowed perfectly). Or Melissa Lion's novels. So good. So dead on.

7. One book you wish had never been written. 

What a strange question. 

8. One book you are currently reading. 

Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist by Rachel Cohn and David Levitan, Enna Burning by Shannon Hale

9. One book you have been meaning to read. 

I have a pile of 29 books to read this school year -- top of the pile is Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant by Anne Tyler

I must only stare at it for a few minutes though. Then I need to get back to my WIP and the comments from my critique group. (Speaking of: the first time you read through a critique, it always sucks. I wish there was some way to improve this, but. . . ouch. Must remember that everything will make the story better. Still . . . ouch. But it is also great. I just need to get over my ego and look at what th critique is really saying.)

"event","So, as I continue to revise my WIP (which in this case means totally writing a new draft -- I wrote draft 1, then completely discarded it and called this new version draft 2 -- confused? I am a little, too) I have decided to share my iTunes Mix (for right now). Keep in mind this all changes depending on what scene I am writing and such, but:

The Heights

More Than Anyone		Gavin DeGraw	
Moses (Live)		Coldplay	
Kill The Messenger		Jack's Mannequin	
She Is	The Fray	
Barely Breathing	Duncan Sheik				
Brick		Ben Folds Five
Saint and Sailors		Dashboard Confessional	
Annie Waits	Ben Folds	
Rescued	Jack's Mannequin	
Brand New Way		Rhett Miller	
How To Save A Life		The Fray	
Fallen	Sarah McLachlan	
Bruised	Jack's Mannequin	
the dawn's request	Duncan Shiek	
Save Me	Aimee Mann	
We Remain as Two		Page France	
Say Goodnight	he Click Five	
The Luckiest	Ben Folds	
Cry		James Blunt	
Here's to the Night		Eve 6	
The Lights and Buzz	    Jack's Mannequin	
Come Around		Rhett Miller	
Only You	        Yaz
Colorblind	        Counting Crows	

So at this moment all very angsty, heartbroken songs. 

What are the songs you are listening to right now as you write?

Hope to hear from you all --- Beach"

Wrote for a few hours last night with the iTunes going and horrifyingly sad expression on my face the whole time. Not because the writing wasn't going well, but because I was right there, just letting it all come out on the page. Truth be told, I'm a little scared to read back over what I wrote. It's always that feeling, though, isn't it? You write in this semi-unconscious state and then you find yourself going back over it and wondering -- who wrote that? 

Okay. Off to walk the dog and then off to work (my real job).

Have a good day and write write write --

"event","THE REALITY CHICK BUZZ THE BOOK contest!

The PRIZES:

(1) Your choice of either an iPod Shuffle, OR a fifty dollar Amazon.com gift certificate
(2) An autographed copy of REALITY CHICK by Lauren Barnholdt
(3) A copy of the August issue of Teen People, which lists REALITY CHICK as a Can't-Miss Pick for August
(4) Free tuition to a session of Lauren's YA writing class

THE CONTEST:

STEP ONE: Simply copy and paste this whole message (including the info about the contest) into any blog, message board, email list, or myspace bulletin.

REALITY CHICK by Lauren Barnholdt is NOW IN STORES!

Going away to college means total independence and freedom. Unless of
course your freshman year is taped and televised for all the world to
watch. On uncensored cable.

Sweet and normal Ally Cavanaugh is one of five freshpeople shacking up
on In the House, a reality show filmed on her college campus. (As if
school isn't panic-inducing enough!) The cameras stalk her like
paparazzi, but they also capture the fun that is new friends, old
crushes, and learning to live on your own.

Sure, the camera adds ten pounds, but with the freshman fifteen a given anyway, who cares?
Ally's got bigger issues -- like how her long-distance bf can watch her
loopy late-night ""episode"" with a certain housemate...

Freshman year on film.
It's outrageous.
It's juicy.
And like all good reality TV, it's impossible to turn off.

IN STORES NOW!

Check out Lauren on the web at www.laurenbarnholdt.com or on her myspace at www.myspace.com/laurenbarnholdt

STEP TWO -- Email Lauren at lauren (at) laurenbarnholdt.com and let her know you've posted about the contest and the book, and you'll be entered to win the prize pack! The winner will be picked at random on September 1st. The more places you post, the more entries you get. Have fun and good luck!!!"

"event","Have you ever had one of those times when you think. . . not possible? Seriously? 

Let me explain: I've been working on Draft 2 of The Heights for about 5 weeks so far, and it's going good. In between spurts of writing I cruise the web. So, I'm looking on amazon.com at various books, and see Nailed (I forgot the author... my bad). So I read the synopsis, trying to figure out what the book is about, and discover the love interest's name is Kylee. Which is cool, except my girl's name in the WIP is Kylie. Now, this is not a big deal or anything I thought about for a second. I mean, I didn't even know this book existed when I started the first draft almost 6 months ago. 

So then I'm bowsing, looking up John Green's new novel, and disover that the best friend in the novel is an Arab-American named Hassan. Which is cool. I really think that's cool, especially since my novel has an Arab-American best friend named Hassan. Now there's no way I copied this. Today was the first day I found out what John Green's novel is about. 

I know this doesn't mean anything, but I was left wondering. . . karmic slap in the face? Just an uber-coincidence? What is going on, people?

Okay. Off to write. (Must resist the tempation to use the FIND/REPLACE button and change Kylie to Rachel [Oh wait -- what about Martin Amis' The Rachel Papers?] and Hassan to Alex [which I'm sure is in some other novel and I know isn't an Arab-American name])

"event","Well, I am back from vacation, but now housesitting at my sister's house. This past week has been filled with some amazing things -- 

One -- I had someone read my first chapter of my WIP and the comments I recieved were so spot on and wonderful. I can't even describe my gratitude. 

Two - in an earlier post I talked about how much I loved the two YA novels Melissa Lion has written. This is still true. She should be on every must-read list. Check out Swollen and Upstream. So -- I jut checked my comments, like I usually do, and I found a comment from ""Melissa Lion"" saying she was working on her third novel and that she was glad I liked her books. Now, if it was really her -- I am flabberghasted and shocked that she somehow found my little page and actually took the time to comment. And if it was her -- write faster! If it wasn't, and who can really be sure nowadays -- then I don't want to know. Thinking that one of my favorite authors actually found my LJ is too good to ruin right now. 

Okay. Back to writing.

Been working on the second draft, still going as much as possible. Many many many thanks to everyone who helped me through my uber-angsty post last time. Everything -- from advice to kind words - was really appreciated. 

I am on vacation in North Carolina and the weather has been amazing. My days are spent out on the beach reading and my night are spent with the laptop. My only complaint is that the beach house we are staying ou is sort of remote, which makes it nice, but at the same time all I have been craving lately is Starbucks.

Now, I'm not a coffee drinker. I don't drink pop (or soda -- which ever one is less Midwestern to say) either, for no reason other than I've just not gotten into them. But last week, when I was making a pre-vacation run to Barnes and Noble, the little Starbucks inside the bookstore was having ""Frappachino Week."" One of the perks, as I found out, were the workers travelling throughout the store, handing out small samples of the various flavors of drinks. It was all a ploy to get you to buy a drink. And I was suckered in. I was hoodwinked. I was bamboozled. I got ho-checked by Starbucks. And now I am, like a million trillion other people, offically hooked. 

Until the next thing comes along that I become slightly obsessed with. 

Sort of a boring post, but just an update to make me feel like I haven't dropped completely off the radar.

Best of luck to everyone out there -- Beach"

"event","I've been thinking alot about first novels. 

I'm not ashamed to admit that I recently attmpted Cynthea's RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT critique. I was, however, a little embarassed to discover that I didn't make it past the first page. Now, right as it happened I felt embarassed and angry and all those other irrational feelings. But then I remembered that rejection is not personal. Not at all. Cynthea did not reject my first page because she doesn't like me, or because she wanted me to feel bad.

So. I started to think about what was going on in my first page, and what made Cynthea pass. (I couldn't very well ask her, but I wanted to try to figure it out myself.) Obviously, the first thing that I know (and that I knew before I even submitted to the contest, was that my first sentence was not catchy. I know that most writing teachers tell you that the first sentence is most important. Look at some examples where the first sentence is meant to really draw you in (these all come from first novels):

The room is bright and alive at 8:45 A.M. -- I can almost ignore Middle Borough High School's zombie fluorescent lighting. (Ned Vizzini - Be More Chill) 

* This is an exmaple of leading in with an interesting view and a sense of setting.

It was 7 minutes after midnight. (Mark Haddon - The Curious Incident of the Dog in Night-time)

*Makes the reader wonder who would be up at seven minutes past midnight, and why the number seven is not spelled out. 

It's funny how one summer can change everything. (Sarah Dessen - That Summer)

*Sets the reader up to know something is about to change -- things will not be the same.

Besides this, you want a catchy first line in order to hook an agent or editor who will hopefully continue reading on and fall in love with your novel. 

Now, undoubtedly, as I found myself thinking, having that catchy first line (and before anyone berates me for being too literal, I mean a catchy beginning, something to really hook the reader in) is as important as a great cover letter, or an ability to snappily summarize your novel in a few sentences. It is, basically, a selling point for your first novel.

So, looking back at what I subbed to Cynthea (who is wonderful and so great for offering help like she does -- so please don't consider this an attack on her) I realzed my first page is not really the typical first novel first page.

So part of me instantly thought -- well, I'll revise, I'll change the start so the reader is hooked.

But then the other part of me thought, ""No, this start is how it is for a reason."" 

My question, i guess, is do I trust the part of me that is saying that every line in that first page, lines that I have gone over and over and over, are really as important as I once thought they were? Part of me is arguing yes -- Every line of dialogue to every description is important. But in a way that is not obvious only through reading the first page. (But -- other me argues, an editor or agent may not get that far.)

So what shoudl I do? Change my first few pages to something catchy, sure to hook in the reader, or trust the part of me that has reasons (and they could be -- admittedly -- wanna-be artistic aspirations to make great literature) for every line. 

My reasoning is that this novel I'm currently revision (the one I subbed for RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT) feels different. To me, to change what I want it to be (just so it catches someone's attention) is a little like giving up and not ending up with a final product that I am pleased with,

I am blathering, of course. You are probably rolling your eyes and thinking, Get over yourself, loser. 

This is why I need a crit partner or someone (HINT HINT HINT for anyone out there who is willing to take a chance on me -- I'm really nice, I promise).

This post has gone on for too long. I hope someone reads it and has something wise to add. I trust you all. Please help."

"event","All right, so here goes with the few books I've read recently:

Swollen by Melissa Lion. Basically, a girl is who neither popular or hated finds herself caught up in a new relationship with a boy named Farouk. There are no right words to describe how amazing this novel is. I am envious beyond belief that Melissa Lion's first novel is so amazing, and that her second (Upstream) is even better. A must read. At the end I wanted to go back to my WIp and find all the parts that sounded true, and dump the rest, just so I could be somewhat like Melissa Lion.

Twilight by Stephenie Meyer. Teen girl moves to a new town and discovers she is in love with a vampire, and he is in love with her. Like most people, I've hear a million things about this book and thought that when I read it I might be dissapointed... In fact, I was really surprised by how much I like the characters. The book didn't feel at all like it was 500 pages, and then ending just left my begging for a sequel (which Meyers is working on right now). 

Crackback by John Coy. This was an easy, fast read about high school and family and steriod use. The characterizations weren't all I thought they could be, but I really like the crisp, simplicity of the prose. 

One of those hideous books where the mother dies, by Sonya Sones. A young girl's mother dies, so she goes to live with her absentee father, who just happens to be one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood. I first encountered Sones in Megan McCafferty's Sixteen, and loved her short story in prose. This book did not dissapoint. Funny, clever, quick, and really satisfying. 

And I just started reading Jennifer Jacobson's Stained, and only a few chapters in I can tell that it is one of those books I wish I had written. 

And recommendations or input on what I've read or what I should read next? (I have Pete Hautman's Invisible up next.)"

I've also been super busy writing this new thing, chugging along so fast it's almost scary. I also took another look at new short story for my class and have figured out that I always write about two things, water and family. It's weird how that works out, but there it is. I am nervous about sharing the story because this time it is in a smaller setting (just four people) and there's one really viscious kid that writes sci-fi that loves to tear other people's stories apart and I'm just praying I don't have him in my group. 

I will work on Thurdsay for the first time in almost a week and a half, and I need money. Not really like desperate, but as in seeing my bank account dwindle and not being able to buy as easily as I used to. (Hence my inability to buy the 1st season of Grey's Anatomy at this moment.)

Any ways, in more proof I am a useless ball of nothing, in my ssc (short story class -- i shortened it), the teacher told me I was strange -- most people that can rattle off random facts like I do are very quiet and removed, while he said I was always very alert and into everything.

"event","Oh -- awkward post-high school experience: I had to run into one of the 24 hour computer labs for a second to print something off, and I sat down at the first open computer I saw, got online, got what I need, closed off, signed off, and was standing to leave when I realized Greg Andrus (looking very tranny with his hair down and magenta-writing on light green shirt) was sitting next to me, smirking in that way of his that makes you sure he thinks he's superior. I bolted as fast as I could. So weird. 

I scheduled this morning. Usually I have sixteen credit hours -- four four hour classes. it works out well. Steady and I'm capable of doing it. But this time, as I scheduled, I noticed that on Monday, Wed. and Friday, I had a huge chunk of time between Spanish 103 and English 410: The modern English Novel. So, I browsed around and found that another class I need to take was available for the time slot, so I am now fitting English 423: Virginia Woolfe/Mrs. Dalloway into my schedule. The thing is, I'm excited about the class. I am now a solidified, dorky English major. I will read classic works of literature and be able to spout of important passages. I will know the refrences to Aneas and Gatsby and Medea and have all sorts of random little bits of info to spout out at parties. 

I have no idea if this is a bad thing or not, since my mind is already a fount of the most useless pop culture knowledge ever. Really. I surprise myself. In class the other day, two people were talking about this new movie coming out, called ""Ultra-violet."" They knew the star had been is something else, comic-book related, but couldn't remember her or the movie's title. Not only did I know her name (Milla Jovavich) and the movie (Resident Evil) but also that it had a sequel, a new installment of the game was coming out soon, that the first movie featured Michelle Rodriguez, who got her start in Blue Crush with Kate Bosworth, and is now on Lost. All of that snapped to mind in .3 seconds. I am a freak.

It was great when I was a kid and everyone was forced to give me a valenine, and for one day the most popular kids where the ones who included candy with their little half-folded, cardboard-like love messages.

I loved Valentine's day when I was in high school, and I never had a girlfriend, so inevitably a good female friend of mine would hug me and give me a kiss on the cheek and wish me a good day. And even if I groaned and rolled my eyes, it was still generous and thoughful, and did make my dad. 

And even now, I love Valentine's day. I just pulled into school when I got a voicemail from my father, who is out of state on some business trip. He asked me to run to Krogers after school and buy my mother flowers and chocolate.

"event","So Saturday night was the St. brigid annual bowling event (I kid you not. It's real). Basically, for two hours, over 100 people bowl, and then we all head over to Coaches, and get shitfaced until 12:30 or 1:00. Luckily, I had to work, but I was called in as the DD (designated driver) for my oldest sister Vanessa. 

The parking outside Coaches (you know what that is right -- small corner bar, wt Xenia people hang out there every night, hoping someone attractive will come in -- no one does), the parking was horrible. Drivers acting like jackasses, cars piled all the way back to the Rite Aid parking lot. So I arrive, driving my sisters huge SUV, rocking out the Red Hot Chilli Peppers (she's old school, what can I say?) 

Inside, it's packed. Literally no place to sit, a mass of people at the bar, others standing, and almost everyone is smoking. Top it off that most of us are Catholic, it's pretty safe to assume everyone was drunk. There were two waitresses working, crappy food, and Smashmouth was played at least three times, which to me is three times too many. 

All three of my sisters were there: Vanessa (who gets very talkative and friendly when she's drunk), Valerie (who was keeping a close eye on her husband, who would party until 5 am if she let him) and Anglea (who is pregnant, and felt the need to remind us of that every few minutes). My dad was there, trying to hold himself in (because around younger guys my dad likes to pretend he's not 52) and my mom (who other people think is cool -- well, they are drunk -- but I am consistently ashamed of). Drew Boo was there, hanging like one of the boys, while I sat at a table and tried to not fall asleep, refusing (for the thirteenth time) to eat these nasty rolls with onions and something green that was being hocked off as food). 

So, at one, we finally rolled out, and I had the task of driving Vanessa home (she's the one that lives in Miamisburg and has the pool). Of course we had to stop for Steak and Shake (which is her drunk-food of choice). Needless to say, an hour later (and full, thanks to cheese fries and steakburgers) we both fell asleep (not together -- that's nasty). 

Then, this morning, Vanessa had her bi-monthly Greyhound meeting at Petsmart. She bought a greyhound (like the one on the bus) three months ago. He's huge, and black nd white, and named Bubba. Every other weekend she and these other people from the Cincinatti Greyhound Adoption Center meet at Petsmart and try to encourage people to adopt their own greyhound. The dogs are really chill. They spend most of their time sleeping, and the rest of the time moving around trying to find a place to sleep.) I had to Febreeze all my clothes in the morning, because I forget to think ahead and realized everything I had smelled like smoke and beer. Not cool. (And don't even get me started on my hair. Nasty.) 

So after that, it was lunch at Qdoube (or whatever it's called), which was then taken to sister Angela's house, where Vanessa finsihed watching last week's Grey's Anatomy and I managed to spill all over myself. Then Mom and Drew (who bought new track shoes -- he's on the track team or trying out or something like that -- not that it justifies the ungodly amount of money spent on his new shoes) and Angela (who is more pregnant by the moment -- or maybe it was the Taco Bell she ate) arrivbed, followed by Chris (her husband, and HOPEFULLY, the baby's daddy -- just kidding) and my dad (who was clutching a 24 pack of Michelob Lite. Needless to say, after about a half hour (did I mention the four dogs running in and out and tracking mud everywhere), I left, to be home alone, which brings me to now."

"event","I just got to school. I was not sure I would make it, to be honest. I was driving in front of Crazy Bitch. I think you know her (we all must). Even when all the cars ahead of her are bumper to bumper, and there's a steady stream of traffic going the other way, Crazy does that thing where she swerves to the side, as if she's going to pass. But where will she go? Realizing there's no way she can pass the fifteen cars ahead of her, she does the only sensible thing: places her front bumper against the back of my car and waits, anticipating every movement I make because, obviously, I can control the flow of traffic. I'll just pull out my huge cell phone, call every car ahead of me and say, ""Hey, look, this lady behind me, she's in a hurry. What? Yeah, i had no idea either. So, instead of just driving as slow as possible, let's all get our cars moving, cause she's kind of in a hurry. I know, I know, I wanted to sit in traffic for another half hour, too, but she's insistent that we move."" I mean, what does she expect? So then, as we got towards Col. Glen and are on the four lane over pass, Crazy Bitch jumps from the far right to the far left, chases downt he car in front of her, and skips back over two lanes. Oh, and did I mention the best part? She's in a minivan. A huge ass, blue minivan that probably doubles as a shuttle for her three kids. 

As you can tell, I am not a huge fan of Crazy Bitch, nor her siblings: Dangerously Slow Driving Old-Person, or Super-Singing Distractedly-Driving Teenager. 

Our cat, Sable, which has been alive for sixteen years (I think that's a long time) is being put to sleep this morning. She's lost most of her teeth, is pretty much bling, and deaf. She's been unable to eat for about three days now, and is slowly starving herself to death, so my mom decided it would best to let Sable die peacefully, instead of in pain. 

I'm sad, obviously, because no one likes to put a pet down, but especially because Sable was always our grumpy old cat. Even when she wasn't so old, she was the old mean cat. She hissed and bit at you (charming, I know) andthen late at night would want to snuggle on your lap. To see her in the past year grow thinner and not be able to tell where a wall is, where her food is, who you are, is sad. 

My mom cried alot last night. She's really upset, as I think she would be, and will probably spend the better portion of today bummed out. It will be strange to go home and not find Sable there, glowering from on top of the couch, or meowing from the laundry room where her food is. 

This past month, it's been a sort of funny game of figuring out where she is (as, in her senility, she likes to hide somewhere and then sleep for 23 out of 24 hours in the day). 

Yesterday I couldn't find her for the life of me, going from bedroom to bedroom, looking under beds and behind couches. My mom, whom I was on the phone with, was convinced that Sable had walked off somewhere to die, and was getting worried over the phone. 

""I just don't know where she is,"" I repeated to my mother, sensing her tense on the other end of the line. 

""Keep looking,"" she urged me. So I made another pass of the house, finally ending up in the hallway, phone pressed against my ear. 

""Nothing,"" I told my mother. I steeped foward into the bathroom, flicked on the light, and nearly had a heart attack. There was Sable, resting on the mat just outside the shower, blinking her opaque eyes up at me. 

This all may not mean much to you, but in a family like mine where we live for pets and usually treat them better than each other, a death of an animal is a big deal."

"event","I finally finished my WIP. It came out to 51,800 words, which I think is pretty good. I feel great right now. I'm riding the high, and already have another idea, and some short stories to work on. Mudrock, a local literary magazine, is doing a short story contest for undergraduate students, and I was thinking of entering. I have to see if I can get out a story I'm really happy with, but I don't see why I couldn't. 

It's been a long time since I've posted. Sorry. (I'd feel even worse if anyone read this. Oh well.)

Meeting with advisor tomorrow. Almost done reading ""Osprey Island.""

Later."

"event","<P>I had my first short story crit/discussion today, and I loved it. I wasn't expecting to, so it was a nice surprise. I was in a group of five. We each read a little bit from one story, discussed, and then read an even shorter excerpt from a second story. I wasn't crazy about anything I wrote (I had liked one story, but it wasn't much -- too ""face value"" if you know what I mean?</P>
<P>So, I had an hour before class, and one prompt that needed to be done still, so I&nbsp;browsed cnn.com, hoping to find an article to spark a story idea (per the assignment) and I found this great article on sideshow performers trying to make a living working normal jobs. (I have to be honest. I only read the title of the article and looked at the picture. I have yet to read the article. Oops.) I set off, and had three pages (single space, 12 pt. Times New Roman) by the time class started. </P>
<P>Crit went better than expected. </P>
<P>Doug, who is sort of New-Agey and a little scary, has such a distinct voice and an ability to turn metaphors on their heads. He described a hallways as ""necca waffer smelling.""</P>
<P>Dan is a British poet. His first story was the sexiest thing I've ever heard. Sensual and erotic but not dirty or cheap. </P>
<P>Sam has a knack for taking a question and expanding and making a social commentary, which I find amazing.</P>
<P>Penny wrote entertaining, accessable, fun stories that had a lot more going on than meets the eye.</P>
<P>Mine went off well, I think. I felt like mine was the most literary, but also a little pretentious. I really liked the story I read, which made me wonder if it was a case of me thinking it was clever and everyone else thinking it was dumb. . . It's possible.</P>
<P>I want to do more work on the WIP tonight. And get to bed at a decent hour. </P>"

"event","I am sick. My nose is runny and my throat hurts and I am trying to study for Spanish and write another short story for my class tomorrow and at the same time I keep getting distracted by the television and by myspace.com and everything else designed to help me flunk out of college. 

I wrote a little, but the computer was acting up today and it took forever for Word to come up and by that time my brother was home and then Mom came home and it was too distracting. I find this weird, because just the other day I sat in the middle of the fourth floor of the college library, surrounded by other students, and wrote for an hour and a half. So I don't get why being at home is any different?

Oh well. I need to study, and figure out how to get 2 single-space, Times New Roman pages of story done for tomorrow that aren't embarassing and I can read aloud without wanting to shoot myself. 

Don't you all wish you were in college?"

"event","So, I read. A lot. And I figured, hey, no one's looking at this page any way, so why not tell everyone what I'm reading. Just keep in mind I'm only one person, have my own opinions, and, truthfully, am in no place to say a book is bad. (So I never will. Some books I love, some I'm just okay with, but I rarely find a book I hate.)

So...

I am still reading ""Pretties"" by Scott Westerfeld. It's sitting on the floor next to my bed, but it keeps getting pushed aside for other books, and I do feel badly for it, because it's not bad or anything. Not as good as ""Uglies"" but what can I do?

""Size 12 Is Not Fat"" because I think we all need to take a break every now and then and read some fluffy, funny Meg Cabot. It's a fun premise and def. worth checking out.

""Funny Little Monkey"" by Andrew Auseon, which I read in Columbus. I liked it, not loved it (mostly because I've never been so hardcore against my brother or felt totally rejected in school), but learned alot about pace and dialogue from the novel. I will look out for more books by Auseon in the future. 

""How I Live Now"" by Meg Rosoff. I read this a little bit ago. I loved it. Simple and fast and sad and funny and touching and just amazing to soak into. I read on a review that the endin was rushed, but I felt that more than anything the ending was a little too wrapped up, like the author felt like the book was finished, but realized she hadn't resolved many threads in the plot, so she needed the ending to wrap it all together. Still, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a great new author. 

""Devil On my Heels"" by Joyce McDonald escaped the cliche of a racial novel for the first 4/5, which was so enjoyable and fresh that I was sure the ending couldn't get screwed up. But then something unbelievable and totally not possible (in terms of the way the characters acted throughout the first parts of the novel) happens and I lost my trust in Joyce McDonald, which is the worst thing that could happen. The last few pages redeemed the novel a little, because McDonald is a poweful writer. I would still recommend this to anyone."

"event","Well, I am here at school on a rented laptop. I've just written another 1000 words, so I took a break before plunging back in. 
This past weekend I went up to my sister and husband's house in Columbus and house/dog sat for two days, which works out well for two reasons. 

1) They get ""The N"" which means I can indulge in my obsession with ""Degrassi."" It's crazy and Canadian and thier tag is ""It goes there"" which is just so perfect and drama filled. I am strangely addicted to every episode. (Sadly, ""Instant Star"" and ""Boys v. Girls: Puerto Rico,"" which were both on last time I house sat, were not on, so I never found out who won in Puerto Rico, or if Jude chose the ex-boy band memeber/her manager, or Shay, the rapper who loves to dip in the vanilla.)

2) I can write. For some reason, when I hit a point when it feels like I am getting no writing done, for whatever reason, when I got my sister's, I am able to pound out something reasonably workable and move on. It happened this summer with the first part of my WIP, and just again.

On the writing front, the end is coming. It's not in touching distance (not even with a ten foot pole) but I am almost to a point where it is a speck on the horizon and I can sort of figure out what is happening. Much editing is needed, as well as rewrites and a million other things, but, quite possibly, in a month, I could have a complete first draft, which is effing amazing and exciting. 

I will then move on to WIP2 (not started, but thought about), giving WIP time to rest and heal and allowing me to have a fresh eye when it comes to looking at it. 

This is good. This is fun, which is something I didn't think I expected. I love to write, but I keep it secret for now. Right now I just want to write the best stories possible. I'm young, really young. I have time to learn. And I am learning, dear God, am I.

But, now I have to play catch up with my friends, who I have neglected so terribly I am surprised they even bother anymore. But god love them they do, and that's why they mean everything to me.

Congrats to mandywriter, who just signed with Nadia at Firebrand. I can't wait to check their livejournals to see what all is going on in their worlds. 

Soon, B."

"event","Oops. I fell off the wagon. Okay, but I'm back now and I will update regularly. School is going. For the first time, I feel like I really need to study and keep up with my readings and do all that fun stuff. No more cruising for me. 

In a writing note: Congratulations to bananagirl19, who just signed with an agency. I don't know her outside of reading her blog, but I'm not too embarassed to share in her excitement. Looking foward to seeing her book (and future books) in print. 

Short Story writing is going well. I like the teacher, which I knew I would, and the people are all really cool. There's only a few who are strange, but I mean only that I wouldn't usually converse with them in the real world. 

We've been reading Ray Bradbury's Zen and the Art of Writing, and while I like Bradbury, I'm not crazy about what he's trying to say. It's that old thing of different ways for different people. Still, he's an amazing author and I totally respect my SS teacher for choosing Bradbury's book.

Now, I'm off to write. Haircut later tonight, followed in no order by Scrubs, Meet The Barkers, studying for Spanish test, reading short stories, and doing responses. Oh, and finishing Pretties by Scott Westerfeld and Devil On My Heels by Joyce McDonald. . . So, not much."

"event","I got back on the horse and hit over 1,000 on my WIP today. I had been avoiding doing it for almost two weeks. I wasn't sure if I was afraid to get back into my MC's head, or if it was just the same as every other time, when I wasn't sure what I was doing and had no place to go. But I had a place to go, I knew where the story was going to end up, and the points along the journey. So, I procrastinated and played around online until the voice in my head was too strong and I couldn't NOT write. I also tinkered around and did various stuff.

Back in the real world, it was my first day back at Wright State, and as usual, I got there too early and was so nervous and had to fight my desire to eat the whole day. I will not blow up again like I did last summer. It will not happen. 

Right now I'm reading Joyce Carol Oates ""The Falls"" and it's good like all of her others, but I find myself wishing for the simplicity and ease of a YA or just normal novel. Reading an Oates novel is, to me, like jumping into a dark pool of water. You get so immersed and it's hard to pull yourself out. Which is good, unless you have other things to worry about and yet there's the book, staring up at you, practically screaming out to be read. 

Tomorrow I don't have class until 9:45 and so I will have time to kill. Can't decide what I will do. Other than drink coffee. I've decided (right at this minute) I will allow myself two sixty-cent, gut-wrenching coffees a week. No more. It's bottled water the rest of the time. 

All right. I'll probably browse a while longer, but until tomorrow, LJ-ers."

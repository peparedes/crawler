"event","I had so much fun at Fantasy Festival and my designs sold really really well! What was so great was over 75% of the people who brought from me this weekend were repeat customers! I was thrilled to say the least!

Lisa was a HUGE help on Saturday for me. Man, I tell you she is just the greatest friend, I love the woman! 

I just downloaded what pictures I got to take, two of my very favorite teachers and their troupes, Odina & Khajulah doing a duet and a few others who were wearing my designs and danced. I will post pictures later tonight. The only bummer was a couple of times I could not get away from the booth, I was rushed with buyers and I missed a few key people I wanted to photograph. Hopefully next time. 

Update on Miri, she is doing great! running around, playing, napping eating me out of house and home! *grin* I can't wait for her removal of the plate, so that we are done with everything. her fur is growing back in and you can hardly see the scar on her leg and her feet are just great even with the missing toe. 

Yes, they double teamed me last night since I was gone pretty much the whole weekend. You know when kittens love you when one is laying on your head and the other on your chest and they are both purring away and sticking their butts in your face."

"event","I got new hair, so I need new make up and new clothes. For once I need to be somewhat stylish. ;)

Suggestions on what you think would look good on me. 
Make up styles or colors you think I should use. 

Remember my hair is basically dark brown now, with just a hint of red and gold. 
I am plus size of course. 2x or 3x depending on the cut and style.
I have linebacker shoulders.
I have no ass.
I like dresses and tops with long sleeves or at least 3/4 sleeves. 
My complexion with the darker hair color has evened out actually, so I am fair with just a hint of peach. (mostly the freckles give me color) 
I am still putting on my make up the way I did 20 + years ago. 
My eyes are not a true blue, they have green and gold in them. 
I carry all my weight in my stomach, chest and back. (Think potato with legs)"

Wow.
 You are nuts.
 I am a hairdresser that was sent your site about
Jen doing your all ready awfull hair.
 Your a jerk.

I will add it to my dread webpage and any other correspondence I receive.

****Update***** 
I traced the email addy and she has her own website and is a hair police affiliate.
I took a look at her website, she has a good number of pictures up in her gallery and what caught my eye is that none of her clients have rubber bands in their dreads. Not a single rubber band AND I also noticed that their hair isn't wrapped  all around the dreads like mine was. All the pictures she has up of her dread work, look just like the pics that are on the hairpolice website. No wrapping, no rubber bands, etc. 

So very interesting, don't you think?"

Don't let what you ""think"" or what ""you think you see"" dictate what is actual. 

Take the good with the bad. 

Make the effort. Sometimes you will give far more then you receive, but it will balance out somewhere down the road.

There are different kinds of friendship. Try to remember that. 

Friendships change over time, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. 

Change is constant.

The hubby took them, so the angle is a bit off and I look a hell of allot shorter then I am, but at least you get to see the outfit. :) This was not our best photoshoot folks. 

The corset is made with Asian character print silk and trimmed with black PVC, then she added black asian closures all down the front. The Kimono is Black PVC trimmed with the Asian character print silk.

"event","I am making Garlic shrimp Alfredo pasta to take to the Ken & Sarah's yearly party. Fun, fun, fun. and I had to make some baby quiches and mushroom pockets. Why I am doing this is the heat I will never know. But then I get cooking and well I cake stop. 

I had a good time at Stilettos last night, lots of wonderful compliments on my hair, wonderful people I look forward to seeing every week, <b>BUT...and I do mean BUT</b> the music was not good, in fact is was bouncing all over the place, just awful. I was very disappointed and actually irritated. When I tip a DJ and ask for them to play 80's I expect 80's and at least something decent. Whatever was going on last night was not good, not good at all. And I was not the only one that noticed. 

What makes Stilettos is the place, the people AND THE MUSIC.  It is 80's & electroclash, not goth, not industrial, not hip hop, not ghetto. If I want industrial/goth I can go wed. nights or run up to SF for DeathGuild. If I want hip hop or ghetto I can to any yuppie local club. 

That is why I come, I come for the people AND THE MUSIC. 


I will be posting pics tomorrow of my wonderful new dress and corset I got from Darkwear. yay! dress up for me! 

My brother in law may be here next week for a visit. 

Got to run. More later."

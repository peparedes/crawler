"event","when i was growing up (ages 1-14) i lived in a super Polish neighborhood on the south west side.  there was a bakery next to my house and a fruit market around the corner.  between the two of them they had 5 different kinds of ceral and only one kind of milk.  the vegtables were huge and cheap and the bread was always fresh.  there were guys there that knew what i came in for as soon as i walked through the door (i later learned that my mom would call beforehand) and, at the time to an 8 year old that seemed like magic.  so this all leads me to one conclusion...

fuck farmer jack.

i can never find anything.  they only have one kind of real butter and it's in sticks.  i wandered around for 15 minutes looking for thai noodles.  there's no way you could find the ramen unless you had a treasure map.  as soon as i walk in all my ideas of ""running in real quick and grabbing somrthing"" go out the window.  i usually feel so fucking helpless that i just buy pierogi and get the fuck out.  i hate that place so much. assholes.

He says that if I keep taking it I could be dead in 18 months.  He also asked me if I'd like to stay on it, which I thought was nice.  Exploring my options n shit.  Anyway, the whole experience has rekindled my love for soup and made me hate male nurses.  

I also think I need new jobs.  At one of my jobs I am paid poorly but am expected to handle every little problem.  The other job is pretty much the same except it pays a little better.  I'd like a job where my rate of pay is directly affected by the amount of effort I put into my job.  Maybe I should work on commission somewhere?  Would anybody actually buy a used car from me?

Oh!  I saw MTV Cribs while in the hospital and I think I'd get along really well with Robbie Williams."

"event","i've been having way too much of what others call a ""good time"" lately.  went to CKY last night which was sweet but i couldn't watch the show cause most of my friends were drunk enough that the band didn't matter.  they just went on shouting at me about things i could care less about.  or atleast less than CKY.  so i joined up and got wasted.  then we ended up at this kids party; here i am at the home of this kid i like and i'm bored out of my skull cause everyone there, except like 4 people, are true boneheads.  and then on the way to drop off the kid who's the best and worst of us, we have to eat at this shitty wannabe diner like 3 blocks from his house.  nasty, nasty, nasty.  blaaaah.  anyway got home at 4:30 this morning knowing full well i had a meeting at 10.  who the fuck has meetings on a sunday?"

she was on the phone today and her accent faded to  almost nothing.  i mean, you could
hear she was french, but there was no awkward ""how do you say?"" going on.  it was
concise conversation, straight and to the point.  she hangs up and it's back to the french

tears and then give you that miserable scowl that makes you feel stupid for having thought

again?  has it ever crossed my mind that i probably would never have been interested in
her had she not been french, AND SHE MIGHT KNOW THAT?  is she playing up to my
Amelie fantasy that she scoffs at every chance she gets? (""you wont cute tings?  you go do

"event","miss Em's last journal entry has reminded me of my love for the platypus.  

	The platypus is one of the two animals in the order Monotremata. It is the only member of the mammal family Ornithorhynchidae. Platypus is from the Greek platys meaning broad and pous meaning foot, referring to the animal's webbed foot. 
	The platypus has several reptilian characteristics which include using the same opening for reproduction and eliminating waste products, the ability to lay eggs, cervical ribs, and local ascorbic acid synthesis in the kidney.
        Even though the platypus has these reptile characteristics, it is overall much more mammalian than reptilian. This unique animal has a lifespan of 10 to 15 years. 
	The platypus is about the size of a household cat. The male platypus's body is about 50 - 60 centimeters long and the female is about 40 - 50 centimeters long. An adult male platypus weighs about 2 kilograms and a female platypus weighs about .9 kilograms. 
	The platypus has a thick covering of waterproof hair all over its body except for the feet and bill. The outer hair is a dark brown with yellowish hair on its underside. There are about 800 hairs per square millimeter. This is denser than the fur of the river otter or polar bear. The platypus has two layers of hair. The top or longer layer is a shiny guard fur with a woolly short
fur undercoat. The thermal qualities of the fur allow the platypus to withstand cold temperatures. 
	The platypus's sensitive, pliable bill is a blue-gray, blackish color with the two nostril holes near the tip. The location of the nostrils allows the platypus to breath while the rest of the body remains under the water surface. The lower bill is smaller than the upper bill. The lower bill is held in place by two elongated dentary bones which is found in all mammals. The bill contains an electro-receptor system which has approximately 850,000 electrical and tactile receptors. When the platypus goes underwater or drives for food, it closes its ears, eyes, and nostrils. Its electro-receptor system detects the
electric currents created by the muscle activity of small prey and may even help the platypus detect the electric field created when water flows over prey hidden under rocks, mud, and small debris. As the platypus gathers food in its
mouth, it moves the food to its cheek pouches. When it returns to the surface, it pushes the food from its cheek pouches up to its mouth. It then grinds it with its grinding pads. 
	The ear openings or grooves are on either side of the platypus's head.  The platypus does not have external ears. These openings are closed when diving or swimming under water. Out of the water these ear openings are very sensitive to sounds. 
	The small, beady eyes are very sensitive to movement. Cone cells have been found in the retina. This indicates the possibility of color vision for the platypus. Its eyes are well placed for scanning river banks. 
	The platypus has four legs which extend horizontally from its body. This arrangement makes it walk on land with a shuffle like a lizard. The front feet have large webs of skin which help to propel the platypus through the water. The platypus swims with alternate strokes of the front legs. On land the webs fold back revealing the sharp claws which are used for walking and
digging burrows. The back partially webbed feet have a series of sharp, curved claws which help to steer and balance the platypus when it is swimming. The claws are also used to anchor the animal while digging and to clean its fur and to help keep its fur waterproof. 
	The paddle-like tail of the platypus is broad and flat. It is used as a rudder when swimming and to push the soil within the burrow when tunneling. Its main purpose is to store fat for when food supplies are low or when the platypus needs more energy to incubate eggs. A plump tail is a sign of good health. 
	The body temperature of most mammals is 37 to 38 degrees Celsius. The body temperature of a platypus is about 32 degrees Celsius. This reduces
the rate at which the platypus loses body heat in the water. 
        The platypus's red blood cells carry larger amounts of hemoglobin than any other mammal. This allows the platypus to go without air for longer periods. The heart rate of a platypus can drop from 140 - 230 beats a minute to almost 0 beats per minute. 
	Males and females reach sexual maturity at the age of two years. Only the left ovary of the female platypus functions. The other ovary is poorly developed and does not function. This characteristic also occurs in birds. After mating the female leaves the male and lays two to three eggs in a nesting burrow. The eggs of the platypus have large yolks and rubbery shells like reptile eggs. When the babies hatch they nurse from the female's milk glands. The babies do not leave the burrow until they are about 17 weeks old.  Only young platypuses have rudimentary teeth which are replaced with bony plates. 
	The platypus is the world's only venomous furred animal. All platypuses are born with spurs on their hind feet. The spurs on the female fall off after the first year. The spurs on males become venomous during the breeding season. 
	Platypuses are capable of making sounds. These sounds have been compared to a puppy growling."

I was in line at the drug store today (buying drugs) and this kid in a crass shirt comes up to me and asks ""are you punk rock?""  I don't think there was anything particularly ""punk"" about me at the time, maybe it was the boots i don't know.  anyway, if i were ""punk"" i would probably have told this kid to fuck himself.  i didn't.  i felt bad for what's ahead of him.  high school, college, that one girl who's gonna fuck his head up for a few years.  i just sort of shrugged it off with an ""i guess"".  yet another new person i didn't want to deal with.  although i am dealing with him i guess.  

picture the whole world as a house.  each room is a country.  each drawer or closet or box is a region of this country.  now consider a book in a box in the drawer in a dresser in a closet. in that book is a picture of that kid from high school that you used to smoke pot with.  that's one persons position in relation to the rest of the world.  

my job is to sell the past to the present.  you buy a record from some bum for $2.  you clean it, resleeve it, put a nice plastic protector over it,  and sell it to an automotive engineer for $40.  happens every day.

i love records.  they seem more personal than cds.  I put on coltrane's ""naima"" yesterday and i started wondering what he was thinking about while he was playing.  i mean, i think about all sorts of stuff while i'm doing my job.  was he thinking ""this sounds great"" or ""i gotta get some milk on the way home""?  sad thing is he was probably thinking about morphine.  fuck.  a cd could never put me on that train of thought. never."

I'm pretty tired now as I've been staying up till around 3-4 am recently, just unable to sleep and not waking up till gone 2pm the following day. I'm sure it can't be good for me. My left eye keeps twitching too. It's getting a bit irritating now that it's been going on for a week.

Still, I doubt I'm going insane as that would actually be INTERESTING and I'm not allowed to have anything like that happen to me.

Sweet. An archer. It's kinda funny really that I should get this result as I'm somewhat of a sniper in real life. I was picked to shoot for Wales in the International Small Bore Rifle Competition, which was kinda cool as the school now has to acknowledge me as someone other than, ""That kid with the long hair.""

Even if the Warden is trying to make me cut it.

Bastard.

I'll not stand for it, you hear? One of these days you'll be walking back to your house, all smug at having ripped the last bit of humanity out of some poor sod with your political bulshit and WHAM! One in the kneecap from 200 meters. Take that you greasy bastard!

>_>

OK, maybe I'm getting a bit worked up over nothing here. But he really is an ass.

I'll probably not update this for a while as it's the holidays so I'll be lucky if I can motivate myself to get out of be, let alone out of the house.

And so, my non-existant readership, I'll leave you now with a song.

*ahem*

Miiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just kidding. I'm bored as hell here.

I'm on holiday now but I have a ton of work to do, the little bastards in the junior boy's house haven't got any less irritating, I very nearly crahed into a hedge while driving home with my sister at a speed about 4 times faster than was sensible, and I watched Wales win the Grand Slam for the first time in 27 years.

The last one was good.

The others weren't.

I feel like crap from having had a cold for two weeks solid and my head is almost constantly throbbing. Damn sinuses.

The line-up for Reading Festival, for which I now have a ticket, is being announced tomorrow and almost all of the online comics that I read are getting really interesting.

Seems that with the good comes the bad and vice versa. I can only hope that I don't win the lottery otherwise I'll probably end up getting AIDS or something.

As I'm bored, I'm going to ask anyone who reads this and feels like it to say which (if any) online comics they read, as I'm looking to expand my arsenal of comics. I see myself as anambassador for online comics. I want as many people to apreciate them as possible.

I'm done now. I may update later in the week through boredom but as no-one reads this anyway I don't really see the point.

Donal out."

I did my Pass Plus today which was about 3 hours of driving on motorways and through cramped crappy towns. But now my insuance is super-low. Wooo.

As a result of concentrating fiercly for 3 hours, my brain feels like it has been removed, minced, had acid tipped on it then glued inexpertly back together with razorblades in it. Fun.

I still haven't finished ANY of the work I was supposed to do for Monday and have totaly forgotten wether or not I have any Chemistry to do. Soit looks like tomorrow I'll be working EXTRA hard.

Ahem.

Honest. It's not like I'm so lazy that I'll neglect doing important Physics coursework. <_<

Back to school on Sunday, just in time to go ona trip to see ""Circus of Horrors"" which is like a live freakshow. Sweet. I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but I went to see a production of Terry Pratchett's Wyrd Sisters before the holidays which was pretty cool. It was only amateur dramatics but it was still quite good. They even sang the hedgehog song. Heheheheh.

Also, a ridiculously late Christmas present arrived the other day. Two boxes of poker chips and Megatokyo Vol. 1, 2 and 3. The chips were broken in during a two-hour game of Texas Hold-em which I busted out of after 5 minutes and the books were finished later the same day. Megatokyo is sweet.

I also visited my mate Mumbo for a few days earlier this week. It was pretty good. We went to see Ocean's Twelve, which was good but a bit over-cheesy in places. I bought a hotdog and a large Pepsi. Have you seen the SIZE of a large Pepsi in UCI? Let me illustrate it a little for you.

A small cup would just fit over the top of a regular can of Pepsi.
A regular cup can fit my whole hand in it, all the way to the bottom.
A large cup requires planning permission. I could probably fit my head in it. It ECHOED for christsakes.

After I finished it, we went home. On the way home, we stopped at Tesco. For quite a while. My bladder can only go for so long, you know. Three litres of Pepsi can do horribe things to a man. My hands were trembling and my palms were sweating. I felt like I was going to die. Then I managed to find a toilet.

Words cannot describe how much I loved that toilet then. I was willing to make it my God. In the end, I just tidied up the paper towels a little. But I think the toilet got the idea. Enough of that though, as I'm starting to sound insane.

I also played and became addicted to Skies of Arcadia which became quite amusing when Mumbo discovered that you can buy items that raise your power stat by 3 and spent 100000 gold on them, turning his party leader into some sort of indestructable Hulk-creature of blasphemous power. It really was quite funny.

That's about it for now I think. Have a good week and remember, say no to drugs.

Heh heh heh. Oh I crack myself up sometimes."

I suppose that now is the perfect time to launch into a ""no-one loves me I'll never find a girl I'm going to die alone screw the universe"" speech, but that would be both over-the-top and childish. Instead, I'm going to say, ""another year, another total lack of Valentines. Shit.""

I'd be lying if I said I didn't care, but, like so many other things, I just don't let it affect me.

Enough of that. I only felt I should put it in to stop this journal sounding like a retrospective to-do list.

On that topic, I went to Richie's again yesterday for the Pro Bowl. It was a pretty good game and we had a good chat about lots of stuff. Also, Jack Daniels was present. In fairly large quantities. Wooooo!

The only bad thing is that I got to sleep at 5am then woke up at 9:30am and drove home at 11:30. So I'm totaly shagged now.

I hope everyone else had a nice Valentine's day and that nothing too bad happens to any of you in the near future. That's about as far as my magnanimosity goes today, I'm afraid.

My life is so full of incident.

I became an official, responsibility-laden house prefect in the Junior Boy's house!
Oh the incredible power! I get to tell them to go to bed and if they're really REALLY naughty I can tell the housemaster on them.

Doesn't it make you green with envy?

On the upside, I also get a gi-massive dorm and a double bed and am under a lot less pressure to do anything, ever. It almost makes up for having to get up five times each night to tell the dickheads next door to go to sleep, or at least stop making so much bloody noise.
Damn kids and their music.

This weekend I drove all the way to Richie's house in Newcastle Emlyn for to watch the Superbowl. It was pretty rockin, if a bit nackeringas I didn't get to sleep till around 6. I then slept for 2 hours then got up and drove to school. I'll not be trying it again. Driving with your eyes closed my sound cool but it's not. Unless you're trying to jump over something or it's in a movie. Then it's bitchin.

But I didn't die or get in trouble for missing lessons on Monday morning so it's all good. I should be going back up to Richie's this Sunday to see the Pro Bowl, which will be equally fucking sweet.

PLUS, on top of all that incident, Wales beat England at home for the first time in 12 years on Saturday. My dad was almost in tears he was so happy. It's nice to see us actually WIN at our national sport occasionally.

Finally, like the cherry on top of a cake, I got to see the last performance of the junoir school play, which I had been directing. Despite going totally mental a few times and despairing totaly at one point that they would ever learn their lines, it all came together on the night. I was down on the programme, name spelled right andd everything. And to cap it all off, they gave me box of Cadbury Eclaires as a thankyou.

So it's been quite a good week for me, all in all. Hope your's goes good too."

The Lord of the Rings thing was called off because the teacher responsible was ""too pregnant"" to be allowed to do it. I finished my exams with an unqualified disaster in CH4 which bummed me out a bit, but then I watched Die Hard With a Vengence which cheered me up a bit.

Nothing much has really happened since last week to be honest. I had a few exams, aced two and got bent over and penetrated by the third. Thank god for resits.

I also drove up to Llandovery from my house to pick up my sister. It's about 24 miles and I drove very well there and back. Not a single life-threatening accident.

I have 1 exam left and it's a bastard. Chemistry CH4, the scourge of all decent students. No-one with an ounce of humanity could have created it. I think they get the Christian Right to put it together.

This weekend there's a LotR hardcore 12 hour long sleepover thing going on and I'm supplying the four-disk extended version DVD's so I may have to attempt an update from school. This is a bit iffy because: a. I'm not even sure the ""safety screen"" on the school network will allow me to look at LJ and b. even if it does, the IT teacher will probably have a little moan about ""proper use of school facilities"" and ""potentially dangerous sites"" and probably ""the CIA spying on me from space.""

He's such a little tit.

That's about it for now. I'll try good and hard to make some interesting things happen in the next week or so but I can't promise anything. See ya.

P.S. I also started two new online comics today, Errant Story and Punks and Nerds.Both look like they have great potential. *rubbs hands together in scheming fasion* Excelent..."

"event","Nothing to report really. The funeral was OK. A nice service, even though I usually despise anything even semi-religious. I even sang the hymns. It wasn't too arduous either. My sistergota bit emotional but I think that was partly to do with the fact that she hated the feeling of the cremetorium. Dad's holding up well too.

I sometimes wonder if people think my lack of emotion means that I don't care. It's not a nice thought, all those people going round thinking that I'm a cold-hearted bastard. I suppose it's just my way of dealing with it. Don't get sad, do something else, don't get scared, get angry, don't cry, fight. I always think that people could get a lot more done if they spent less time moaning and moping and just DID something with all that emotion.
Maybe I'm being harsh. If someone had told me to stop moping and moaning aftermy Mum died I would probably have beaten them into a fine paste. But I've changed a lot in the past two years.

Ugh. This is turning into a bit of an introspective rant. Enough!

The revision isn't so much not going well as just not going at all. I should really pull my finger out and get down to some work but I can't ever seem to motivate myself. I have a horrible feeling that everything is on the brink of totally falling apart lleaving me utterly screwed. If I don't get A's in Maths and Physics and a B in Chemistry I am actually buggered. I have 3 exams next week and I don't see myslef getting better than a C in two of them. Nads.

Aside from the impending disaster that is my University application, things are OK. I started and finished a new online comic (which is due to start again tomorrow) and did some more post-test driving. Now I get to shout at other motorists for doing stupid things and listen to whatever music I want in the car.
Oh the power!!

Peace out.

School wasn't as bad as I was expecting, mostly because I totaly ignored and cleverly avoided all those people who make me angry and give me headaches.
I also passed my driving test on Tuesday, which cheered me up a bit.

My Grandmother died last Tuesday morning but she'd been ill for a while so it wasn't a shock, just a sad thing that was inevitable. The funeral is on Thursday and it's the first one I''ve been to since my mum died the year before last. I hope it doesn't bring back bad memories.

Aside from the depressingly morbid side of my life, everything has been going pretty smooth. My revision is going well, I got an offer of AAB from Imperial College to study Physics, I passed my test, I didn't have to talk to ONE idiotic bigot all week and yesterady I saw a Panto called ""Jack and the Skunkstalk."" Sure it was crude and childish, but so am I, so I had a great time.

I'm also pretty pleased that someone who applied to Oxford as well as me didn't get accepted because she is the most bigoted, prejudiced, homophobic, intolerant, narrow-minded, complacent, stuck-up and all round detestable person I have ever met.

It's not right to glory in the suffering of others but in this case, it feels too good not too.

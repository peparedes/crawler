Where have you been all my life? I'm digging there stuff so much. I can't believe I've been oblivous to them for 20 years.
So yeah, not too many updates, but not too much goes on, and frankly thats ok with me. 
The simple life is good. I have 4 classes and they are freaking running me into the ground.
IT RAINS EVERYDAY , what the hell is wrong with the weather in california?

I had to pay the IRS and California money AGAIN! 0 for 2 on tax returns.
I don't see why I owe them 150 more dollars...I guess all those expenses of going to school and buying books isn't enough of a burden on us young people.

I gotta cram for a psychology exam. I'm not the best student in that class though, I fall asleep a lot so I hope I can bullshit the test alright. You'd think after sleeping 9-10 hours you wouldn't fall asleep again for a while.
It must be the projector slides, that shit is so boring.
im gonna get some sleep.."

"event","Went to a fight yesterday between my boss and another co worker. It was pretty entertaining watch a short mexican dude try and fight a tall overweight guy. It was pretty much a draw.

Afterwards I went over the big guys place and we hung out. Ate some pizza took some shots, sipped on rum all night, watched Amithysomethingville horror. It was pretty weak stuff. Then we played Burnout revenge on the xbox. Man I never realized how fun video games could be, and its even harder to steer while buzzed. So we decided that instead of trying to race, that we will play the crash modes. Instant fun.

"event","So I wanted to make an entry on my boring trip to the mall, but I don't know if I can convey it in a way that is entertaining, but me being the 'creative' writer that I am, I will give it the old college try.

It's saturday: I slept in very late, not realizing that Saturday was my only full day of my vacation at the moment, but once my eyes focused on the clock in the guest room did I realize I was wasting my vacation sleeping; On a floor no less (no extra bed, it was in storage). My shower was way better than any of the ones I've had here at home. The water pressure was just blissful, it almost stung it was so strong. Didn't feel like shaving (thus the scruffy picture), and my mother made pancakes. I do enjoy being cooked for, and pancakes are a personal favorite of mine. 

Lets skip this and go straight to the car ride to the mall.

So its my mother me and sis in the car. 

ok... lets skip the car part. To the mall.

We're there. So here is the first dilema, mom wants to buy me some stuff, but I'd rather go buy my own stuff and not be nagged into buying anything I don't really want. Second dilema, mom says that since I don't have a cell phone (she seems to be peev'd by the fact that I don't have nor want a cell phone) we can't get seperated or we won't find each other for a while. So not even 5 minutes into our mall visit I find it impossible to actually get my mother out of JC Penny's then it hits me really hard, why the fuck am I shopping with my mom and acting like I can't go where I want to. So I wait outside for her to stop looking at things that we didn't  come to the mall to look at. So I take off and leave on my own. Leaving mom to her own mall voyage.

 First stop for me was the sharper image store. Man, this was lame sauce to the second power. Their obvious attraction was their assortment of massagers and massaging chairs. Oddly enough every single one of them were occupied by women. This raises an eyebrow, as I wonder just how much 'fun' these women are having in these massaging chairs. There were a few younger girls in that store too, with much distastefulness they were shouting out ""it tickles my butt"". I made my way as far back as the store would allow to escape their jovial shouts of their chirapsia encounter. I came across a Tetris game, and decided to give it a shot, but this version was very lacking. All it had going for it was the tetris music. I was finished with this store and I then decided to move onward.

Then their was a period of activity that I totally forgot but during that time I ran into my mom and sister again. So we walked together for a while but once again my mother insisted on entering a store that I could not and was not willing to follow her into. I approached a spencers, with halloween decorations all over the place, but this little spencers was crammed full of people and I was not willing to fight a crowd just to browse their shit. So I sat outside of the Macys in a very comfy chair. My freaking legs were getting sore already, I couldn't believe it. So I took about a 20 minute rest, and decided to watch the ladies. I think ever girl who was semi attractive was on their cell phone. That makes sense though, I mean who is going to wanna call the ugly girl's cell phone. Then my sister sits down near me. She says she lost mom in macy's. Cool beans, so we waste time just sitting their, and I was wondering where I was going to find some sandles/flip flops (whatever you want to call them).

 I then decide to go over to the T-mobile booth in the middle of the mall and look at their phones. I was quickly greeted by an asian fellow by the name of paul, and he asked me if I was buying a phone. I told him I was just interested in looking at the phones and that I didn't really want one. He then started asking me questions, obviously he was trying to find something in my answers to grasp onto. I wasn't having any of that. While I looked at the phone I answered his questions. I said I don't call anyone, but my boss and thats only if I can't meet him. So he asked a few more phone questions then I noticed he started to block my view of the phones with a book/brochure of some sorts. So not having any way to look at the phones or see their prices I had to play his game his way. I'm desperately trying to remember the questions he asked me (I would have killed for a tape recorder for this conversation). He asked me if I had friends and family I wanted to call, and I said ""not really"". He then said ""You don't have any friends""? ""Yup, that's right, I don't need em"" was my reply. I didn't think this would leave him much room to work with, but it seems like he had a very complete script in his head that he needed to play out. He then asked me if I had a ""significant other"" instead of saying ""girlfriend"", but hey this is California,I guess he was just thinking progressively. I said, ""fuck that, noise"", he when said ""word"". I didn't understand what either of us was really saying, but somehow I knew no matter what either of us said it was going to move us on to another question. Then he leads in with the comment that ""I could check to see if you qualified for a phone, if you had a credit card"". I then told him that I indeed have a credit card. He seem a little stunned like he lost his place in his script and was trying to back up. He asked me if I wanted to see if I could be approved for a phone, I said I didn't want to sign anything and didn't want to recieve offers, phone calls, emails, or a bill. He assured me it was nothing more than a quick credit check of sorts. So I fill out his little form and write my name horribly , so he would be unable to pronounce it, but then he asked me to please print my name, which he then quickly read and proceeded to use for the rest of the conversation. He then asked me to step around to the side of the counter. Ok time for a paragraph.

Wow, what an improvement, I moved a whole 90 degrees to the right of the booth. He then asked me if I liked to surf as he was typing in the information onto his computer. ""Oh hell yeah, I love to surf"" I replied. He then asked me ""where do I go to surf"". I paused, ""Well I enjoy my own computer and internet connection, but if I must I'll use a library internet connection"". Paul then looked at me and said ""oh, no. Not that kinda surf"". ""OHH, no way man, what the hell do I look like some kind of a beach bum""? Silly me though I was wearing my Laguna Beach Surfing t-shirt, but dude my skin is so pale, I'm whiter than an egg, no surfer could ever be so pail unless they wore a body suit 24/7. ""Hey ! Congratulations! Guess what?!"" said paul. ""..."" said I. ""You've been approved to have 2 phones"". ""well isn't that cool, if only I wanted a phone"". replied I.  He then told me a bunch of information which I wasn't listening to because I was staring at this japanese girls ass. I saw the girl bend over and I said ""Dayum! ('damn' incase I spelled that wrong)"" and paul said ""I can tell you're excited about this"". huh wha? Oh yeah, excited. He then tries his selling tactics, like he thinks he has closed the deal on me. We had a little back and forth conversing.
How many minutes can we sign you up for? Dude, I don't want a phone. It's very useful in an emergency situation. I've never had an emergency. It sucks having to walk to a call box if you break down. My car hasn't broke down, and we don't have call boxes. You say you like to surf the web, well we got some phones that let you surf the net.  That isn't a very compelling feature. What if you need to talk to somebody you know? I would get in my car and drive to their house and talk to them, and maybe bust out the nachos. 
Then his buddy jumps in with questions like he thinks his questions will help sway me to the dark side.
He asks me about needing to call my girlfriend to have her come over and do my laundry. I forget how I dodged his question.
He then asked me how often I use the phone.
I say not often only when I really need to.
Whose phone do you use.
My fathers'.
So you live at home?
Kinda, I'm not required to be there though.
OH, so your dad is a sorta Biological dick?
Uhh... sure.
Just like my dad!
... Well guys its been great-
Wait, we haven't signed you up yet!
I don't WANT a phone.
We have great low minute plans, as low as 30- no- 20 dollars a month!
If I needed a phone with so little minutes wouldn't I just buy one of your TOGO phones?
Hmm, you could, but those minutes are pre paid and expire.
But, I would only buy minutes if I NEEDED them.
But they expire.
Your normal plans charge me regardless if I use the phone or not. 
Paul's buddy then says ""Brent"".
""My name is Brian"".
""Ryan"".
""BRIAN!"". I forget what he said after that, but then I ended the conversation saying ""Hey, thanks for the info, if I ever need two phones, I'll be sure to come back and buy them here."" Paul then gives me his business card, but he had to write his name on it, because it was a generic card, but he said ""Here's my card"". I take it and leave. I then proceed to the Cingular wireless store, but I thought against it and moved on.

I went around looking for sandles, journeys sucked though because the employees called me surfer dude as soon as I walked in. Their shit is expensive too. It also is kinda embarassing when you have to take your shoes and socks off to see if a sandle fits you, because it seems like sock shedding brings all the boys to the yard. Damn I never seen so many homps lookin' my way at once. I then went into a Buckels (I think thats the name) and found awesome sandles all the way in the back of the store, and I was starteled by their gay employee, but I just smiled and nodded. Seriously he popped out of nowhere, and asked me some strange question. Nothing against gay fellows, but they come off a little strong sometimes. 

From there I went over to bath and body works and asked a hot asian chick (who worked their) for a candle that smelled like the ocean. I got the last one. She seemed really nice and had a great smile, she asked me for my ID when I paid with my Credit card, and she said wow is this you, you have no hair in this picture. I said yeah that was a while ago, she said my hair was 'hot'. She gave me my bag and said ""we're hiring right now so if you're interested in working here, I put an app in your bag"".**  I'm gonna stop and post this now, and come back and finish it after a break."

"event","I'm on my mini vacation right now. I brought my sister with me down to the sacramento area (where I'm planning on moving) and we are visiting my mom and aunt. It's been fun so far. Mom has a sense of humor I just can't describe, but thats a good thing. My aunt is happy to see us too. We went out to chilli's and that was the freakin' longest wait I've ever had in my life. I wasn't really focusing on time, but we must have been waiting from 6 till 7 to get in then till about 8 till we got our food. All was well though and I am stuffed.

The only down side to this trip is my mother and aunt will not stop asking me to cut my hair. Sure it is a little long, they keep saying get it trimmed and styled, but then their idea of trimmed is hack off all my hair and look like any other skin head. I don't know of many long hair styles, so I have no idea what they are trying to say when they want it styled. They just keep saying that 'THEY' don't like guys with long hair, and then I had to point out that 'THEY' also don't like to see people with bolts through their eyebrows/ears/tongue/nipples etc. I think they got the message. Different generation, different interests.

I'm trying to score some booze off my aunt but mom doesn't seem to want to let me have any. 
Thats all for now."

I'm hoping while I'm there we can finalize my plans for moving so I can finally get everything sorted out with my councelor at school. Whats the point of going in to see the councelor and saying ""I want to transfer"" but not being able to tell him where?
 Mom always keeps coming up with these new ideas. She recently broke up with her ""boy friend"" so she is no longer living with him, and now shes talking about moving down to Santa Cruz. Hey that sounds nice for her, but she also seems to be leaning towards wanting me to come with her.  Don't know exactly how I feel about that. Santa Cruz is not exactly a part of California I think I could easily fit into. 

I would like to say this is going to be a nice vacation, but I still need to do reading assignments and homework and all that shit while I'm down there so thats going to be a drag. I'm looking forward to see if I can track down my old boss, and surprise her by showing up, but the odds of her being in the same store at being there the same time I go in just seem a little bleak. 

My dad has tried to use my computer twice this month when I'm not home and both times he has told me he couldn't figure out how to use it. My god , I can't believe how out of touch with technology he is. Firstly he couldn't find my mouse. It was charging on the desk right infront of monitor. So he picked up my spare wireless mouse (that isn't connected to anything) and tried to use that, and told me that my mouse wasn't working. now I don't know how bad his memory is but the mouse I use and this mouse are VASTLY different in size and I find it hard to believe he did not notice the difference in shape, amount of buttons, and WEIGHT, right away. 
Then the next time he got the correct mouse, he said he couldn't figure out how to click on anything because there were 'no clicker buttons on the left or right'. So he said the whole time he was pressing the middle scroll wheel button and the forward/back buttons on the side of the mouse. I then had to show him that if you jsut rest your hand on the mouse you will feel the ""clicker"" buttons under your fingers, they are just stealthed.

Here i was worried he might look in my documents and see some pornos or pics that I saved, but lucky for me my first line of defense is his inability to use my mouse."

Long time no update, eh?

Not to say that doesn't stop your worlds from spinning, but maybe you wanted an update.

School is one on hand batshit insane with the homework and all the dates that are being thrown my way, yet it seems like I should be having enough time to do everything just fine. I probably need to cut back my working hours though because that is the cause of much of my stress. Aside from the normal douches at work I have to worry about what the hell is due the next day, and wishing I had some fucking time off work to do it. 

My car is making a damn annoying noise when I turn on the vent or AC. It sounds like one of the fans in the dash is dying or has something hitting the blades and the sound really 'URKS' me so I'll have to take it in and have that fixed. No time though... Well I might have had time today, but I got distracted  [Curse Half Life 2] and threw my sleep schedule out of whack and said 'Fuck You' to my alarm when it went off at 7am. I then fell asleep again... for another 5 hours. Oh boy, time to wake up and go to my job. In case you didn't know it was my lucky day too. They were imposing a new 'Nobody Goes Home Early for the Next Few Days"" policy, and I wanted to go home early. Guess I need to recharge my Karma ... god damnit now that just made me thinking about how I'm getting low on gas. Prices are obviously fucked as everyone must know. 2.87 today up from 2.71 two days ago. I fear to wait longer because it might go up even higher.

I feel bad for N.O. and Bioxi. Those guys are fucking Nomads now, and waist deep in shit water. Those Looters on the other hand can seriously take their stolen goods and shove them up their asses. Why the hell is every looter in N.O. black though? Call me racist, but maybe it's something blacks just do when the chance presents itself. Also a looter shooting a cop in the head floors me. Doesn't matter if you hate cops or not, blowing someone away for trying to keep the peace gets you sent straight to hell.
Do not pass Go.

So I'm going to quickly study for my Far East test I have in the morning. Since I can't stand reading I'll skim the text for my english class. Then I'll down another Dr. Pepper and try to go to sleep if at all possible. 

I didn't get to follow the PAX action so If anyone has a link to a PAX recap/ Picture whore thread then send it my way."

I forgot to A.) mention a stupid situation that happened at work. B.) Give a date recap.

Ok so I'll start with the date first since that is probably what you may have come here to read about, more than me talking about work.

I pick her up at her place at about 4:30. Her house is big and it is damn nice. I am greeted by one of her sisters who asks me to come in. She calls me pizza boy, and I wondered if she ever even mentioned my name to her family. Then the mom (step mom actually) comes over and shakes my hand and says ""You must be pizza boy"". ...
I then talked to the mom some, and of course it was about me being a pizza boy. It was quite the HOT TOPIC. Then it felt like a scene out of one of those movies where they are portraying prom night and the girl appears and walks down the stairs. Ya know that kinda stuff, I'm sure you've seen it in one form or another.
So there she is coming down the stairs and she looked good. I mean it was just a t-shirt and jeans, but she wore them well. Then I met the father very quickly. I gave him a hand shake and introduced myself, then he told us to have fun. So we left. 
 We talked and talked. School, family, future plans, likes, and dislikes. The basic stuff. We held a conversation the entire time. It was hard for us to shut up long enought to order our food. I took her to applebees and she was excited as she has only gone once before. We just got to know each other and it was really great, and I was confident because I was expecting to be nervous and having a hard time finding topics to talk about. It just flowed real nicely. I'm not going to transcribe the conversation as this post would be far longer than I intend for it to get.
 So at this point I thought things were going really well. We both had a sense of each other quirks and character. I at this point thought I liked her. I'm sure she liked me too as it seems some of the things I said about what kinda guy I am she really was happy to hear. So we had killed nearly an hour and a half. Which is what we needed to do since the doors at the show weren't open till 6.

Thus I will call this point the end of the First Half of the date.

So we go to the 'venue'. Surprise Surprise it is a hole in the wall kinda place. Ok, fine I guess the way it looks isn't everything. So here comes the fun part. She is smoking again. So we sit against the wall outside while she smokes. Then her friends show up and everyone else shows up. Holy shit. It was NOTHING BUT TEENAGERS.  14, 15, 16. There maybe were a few 18 year olds but far and few. So being 20 I might have stood out, but with everyone showing up with crazy ass clothes on and red hair, I don't think I was attracting the attention. Emo/punk was the majority of the crowd. The music eventually started, so people went inside. Soon the room was full. It was getting hot inside. HO-LY SHIT was it getting hot. There was no air flow, and B.O. was everywhere. This was the first set. Man I couldn't take more than 2 songs. 

So we spent the next 2 hours outside, listening to music with the door cracked open. Half the people who went to the show were standing outside. But I couldn't listen to the music because my date was talking to her friends constantly and I not wanting to be rude and ignore them I tried to listen and see if I could join the conversation. Not going to happen. All the highschoolers talked about was shockingly HIGH SCHOOL. So and so said this about her. Him and her are blah. BLah Blah fuck shit got a lighter. AHHHGH I was going insane listening to inane 15 year old ramblings.

At some point she mentioned how she wasn't going to be going back to her house. She said she wanted to spend the night over a friends. I guess then that was the first little thing that made the evening get on the path it got on.
Then out of nowhere she leans over to me and says ""you aren't being very social"". No shit. Do you people even listen to what you say?! Of course I didn't say that. I just said 'Well I'd like to but I can't seem to relate to what goes on with these high schoolers, its just a different mind set"". So to make matter even more fun, the bathroom at this place is a fucking ... uh... well.... I can't find the word or words. I don't want to paint the picture, so just imagine a nice normal bathroom (like the one in your house/dorm) then trash it... really bad.... then pee on stuff. Ok good. So if you want to pee, you walk to the bowling alley. The 2nd time I had to go (water goes right through me) the bowling alley people were throwing people out and saying anyone coming from the show was not allowed to use the bathrooms. Only people buying shit. So now I'm being accussed of being one of these punk/emo kids who trashes the bowling alleys bathrooms. I try to explaing that I've never even come here before. She didn't care. I said I was just going to buy water, so then she lays off me. So I guess she was expecting a harsh reaction from me or something like a 'fuck off' or 'screw you' , so I must have made her feel like I bitch when I walked out holding two water bottles and said ""have a lovely evening"". Of course I did use their bathroom just for good measure.

So I resume listening to the stupid teenage bullshit. I tried to talk to her some but it really just didn't feel anything like earlier. Our conversations went from being exactly what I hoped it would be to a nightmare. It was this point I was hoping that we could get this date over with as soon as possible. So then the headline band is about to start.

I over hear my date talking and she says that she is going to the after party. I thought to myself. Hmmm, I wonder how she is getting there. Well it wasn't long before then she said ""you can drive me to the after party"". Then her friends chime in, ""I'm so going too"", ""Yeah, we wanna watch her get drunk"". 
Oooooooooh maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. WHY ME. So the band starts, we try and go inside. We are hit by what could possibly only be compared to a sweaty football locker room in VIETNAM. This band sucked. The amps were just cranked up really loud it felt like they were going for the sing really loud so then they won't care how bad the beat or lyrics are. Then some jack asses started throwing water bottle after water bottle of water on people. Now it would have been nice if this was cold water. NO. This water was room temperature. WARM AS PISS. I've never really wondered what it must be like to get peed on, but now I have a general idea of how it would feel. 

After being shoved for 5 minutes straight and staring at the back of a sweat soaked shirt I just had to run outside. Now it is hot outside (85 probably) but it was such a relief that you welcome it and breath in all the air you can. We spent the next hour outside listening through the open door while she smoked.  Now I went because I wanted to hear music. I just wasn't hearing anything over everyone talking. It sounded like typical classroom chatter, but it was all yelling because the music coming from the door was pretty loud. The onsetting of a headache was begining. 
Eventually the show ended. Thank god. But no, I couldn't just take her get in the car and leave. We had to find the other two idiots (sorry thats a bit harsh) and get them in my car.  We find them and we are ready to leave. A flood of people is blocking the only way out though. I must have got lucky because it was like the sea parted for a brief moment I was able to just drive right through and get out. 
Oh to be on the road and in my car was a good feeling. It was a feeling that let me know that I am in controll again, and things can become less bitchy. They then all three decide that we are going to be getting a peach/strawberry smoothie. So they tell me to get one. They act like they expected me to know exactly where to go. So if they would have just said the name of a place we could have gotten there faster. Instead I have 2 backseat drivers (Girl B and Girl C) telling me directions that are contradicting to eachother.  We get the smoothy and we are off again. 

Now I'll stop and say I'll call this the end of the date. Everything happening after this is just Overtime and not planned or intended.

We arrive at the destination and grab a parking spot. This is an old house that is on a busy road in downtown. I never actually thought much about this place but it seems to be a haven for really young adults. The girls B&C run up to the house. They report nobody is home. Then we run back to my car and sit on the side walk eating fucking sunflower seeds for 20 minutes waiting for someone to come home. To make matters worse every single time a car drove by the girls would all try and hide behind my car. I began to wonder why. They then mutter something about those 'god damn cops' and 'god damn curfews'. Great, I just realize that I now have 3 minors who are out past curfew, waiting to go to a party that will feature drinking, and I am the responsible adult (kinda). Someone shows up, and we go inside. I am informed we must be at girl C's house. Fine thats good to know that things will be over with soon. So we sit on the couch waiting for the alcohol. It never shows up. Nobody was talking. Not even about highschool. The people that were there had to be my age or older (they had to be or they were probably really stupid if they were drinking OUTSIDE on a busy ass road). Cops would drive by every so often as if they were prepared to storm up  to the door if they got a call from a neighbor or whomever. So somehow my date scores a can of beer and downs it. Then runs outside to smoke again. I was not going to get up of the couch to stand with her to smoke again. Fuck that. She then comes back 10 mins later and says she had another beer but wants some real stuff. Apparenlty who ever did the 'beer run' made it a fucking 'beer walk' cuz they were said to be gone for nearly an hour. So we had to go because it was 10 till 12 and we had to be at girl C's house. We all walk outside, but the date is still trying to score some more booze I tell her that shes gotta stop and we need to go and she can't take a beer outside of the house.
""why not?"".
""You're 16, and drinking in public while walking down the side walk, it is a good way to get us all in trouble"".
 So we walk back to the car and she steals a barbie doll from someones kiddie pool in their front yard. Fine, whatever. I don't fucking care anymore. Let us just get in the car and go. 

Directions plz. Not getting much help there. The date seems to have a buzz going. Shes calmed down though. She wouldn't put on her seat belt, though and insisted on laying her head on my shoulder. God damnit I should have made clear I enforce a seat belt policy. I forgot I could get screwed if passengers are caught with no seat belt.  We drive and drive . She lives way out in nowhere land. I was wondering why she didn't say we need to go 20 till 12 since it was going to take 20 minutes to get out there. Then the girls are all being really loud and chatty saying they want to see her drunk still. So then they get on their phones and start planning to go back to the party. I thought 'yeah, right. Who would be stupid enough to want to give these people a ride anywhere"". 
*Now don't put your head in your hands now, cuz I'll let you know right now that I did NOT drive them back*
They were calling everyone on their lists and then they asked me ""hey you, uh guy, will you drive us back ?"" I said why the hell would we do that? I thought you needed to be home for your curfew. She said they will sneak in say ""we're home then run out again"". She asked if I wanted to do that. I had NO RESPONSE for her besides a long drawn out sigh. I'm glad she understood the hint, but I didn't need her to say this guy doesn't wanna do it. GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR. I wanted to say that. I would have felt better.

FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY we get to her place I drive them up to the house and B and C get out of the car. WOOHOO. They actually said thanks for the ride, so I guess manners are not lost on everybody.  My date then said thank you in a semi drunk manner and gave me a hug.  I then drove home all the while saying, 'what the fuck were you thinking?' to myself.

I saw the side I liked in her and the side I could not stand all in the span of 7 hours.
The first half of the date went so well. The last half was a failure for me as I hated every moment. Then being used as a ride in the Overtime part was not part of the deal and was never agreed upon. I got stuck with it. My only obligation was to see that my date made it somewhere safe for the night. She basically started taking control of the date with what she wants to do and it wasn't about trying to know me or spend time with me. It was, you can drive, so take us here. I do not like to play the roll of the driver. I'll tell everyone now that this is the first and last time I go out on a date with someone not closer to my age. I don't care how mature or smart this 16 can sound, when it gets down to the nitty gritty she is still a high school girl who does stupid shit.
I guess thats what I get for trying to not have a long boring date.
It was exactly what I got in the end. Ironic? Yeah, I'll chalk that one up to irony. (fuck the definition)

Thank god it is over with. Now to get it out of my mind and behind me for good.


Now the other thing. 
The manager gave MY pay check to the other Bryan. He never noticed, and took
the check to the bank.... and the bank cashed the check. So I had to wait
around for about ... nearly two hours as we were trying to find where the
check might be. They then say maybe you should just go home, it doesn't look like we will find it.

Then trying to track down Bryan and see if he had my check once we found out his check was still here.
Sure enough he said he picked up 'his' check. We told him to come down to the store. He said
he would see if he could get around to it. So I waited and waited and waited. The other managers
just kinda ignored me and were acting like nothing was wrong and everything was right. 
Oh but one did come up and say 'that sucks'. Hey thanks for that, that really makes me feel better.
The manager calls again. When are you coming down here he asks. He said he was looking for the paystub
since he already cashed the check.

WOW
He cashed the check. I can't fucking believe it. What a collapse of security on everyones part.
Much time passes then Finally he came down with four 100 dollar bills. Nice. Now I have to hit up a bank
before I can do anything. So I go home with my money. I am upset at the whole situation. No appologize,
no one admiting fault, and everything is being swept under the rug. Man, people screwed up BIG TIME,
and they are just lucky we were able to track him down BEFORE he blew all that money. 
I just can't believe how the manger, other brian and the bank could all make a
mistake that day.
I would have almost have gone home if they did not suspect the other brian. But even then I had to wait around so freakin long it just wasn't  a great situation.

I trie dto talk to the boss last night about what he thought should be done. He said 'done?' 'you got your money whats the problem?'. I knew he was gonna give me a jerk off response like that. 
Someone got my check. They cashed it. Had they have been crafty enough and taken the evidence I could have lost the check all together. It inconvenienced me and the whole pretend it never happend thing doesn't make me happy. Nobody steps forward, nobody appologizes, nobody wants to admit it happened.

I'm feelin' like blowing the whistle and letting the bosses boss know what went down and how pissed I am about the fact that everyones fine with what happened. For people who sure talk a lot about company pollicies they sure don't wanna follow the pollicy when they are respnosible. They can cry all they like about things being 'fine' but someone did something really fucking stupid, sorry but you gotta pay the price for the mistake. Goodness knows they jump on me about everything."

"event","Man that cafe was shit. 
Getting something to drink took 10 minutes. I asked for a menu and I never fucking got one. It's like during those 10 minutes they decided to do as little work as possible. From what little food I saw it looked like nothing but appitizers. Shit, the bridge sounds like a lousy place now. Hey lets get shitty coffee and walk up and down the bridge twice in the hot sun. 

I've actually been thinking of calling in sick on saturday so we could do something at night instead of just the afternoon

Ok so I'll move on to the next plan. Avoiding being outside in the heat. Well I figure we can go get something to eat. I wouldn't mind getting something nice and being somewhere enjoyable. So I figured I'll take her out to a restaurant. Applebees is the choice so far, but I am flexable if anything comes up. Like if she were to say ' I don't go there cuz such and such happened and whatever"". But I don't expect that to happen. I'll just suggest somewhere and if she says sounds good then we'll go for it. Theres a concert on saturday night that she really wants to go see and I think it would be great if I could go too. But I have a lousy 3 hour shift on saturday night during the time of the concert./

So it looks like we will be able to get food for sure. But I don't want it JUST to be pick her up, buy her something to eat, then take her home. That just sounds so fucking boring. I don't think any good movies are out right now, and movie theaters are bad for getting to know someone so I would rather save a movie for when we want to just do something fun and not worry about needing to talk.
 
I'm not sure how to follow up lunch at a restaurant though. This town doesn't offer a lot of real excitment. If I can't think of anything else I'll just offer to take her to an ice cream place for whatever she likes then work towards winding things down. I'm not trying to have a 4 hour long date, but I would like it to be long enough that we can converse and have fun without stretching things on for too long.

I'll take any ideas."

"event","Shes only 16. 
This conversation went way better though. It was about 15 or so minutes and there was only a few small silences. Talked about family and school and summer vacations and occupations. She likes a lot of music that I don't really know. So I have to check out Modest Mouse and Red Robot. 

I also have to see if the cafe I was planning on taking her to is even open still. She said she heard it got shut down. So at least I can get some time to figure out what to do still if that doesn't work. 

She doesn't seem like an airhead highschool student, so thats a plus. She is big on soft ball and she wants me to come watch her if she makes the team.

I feel no fear now. Where as before I was going to call I felt like I was going to flop, but hey I come out feeling like King Gorilla here. My phone was dying in the last few minutes of the conversation. I barely had time to get my phone number to her. 

Says she doesn't do drugs, didn't mention drinking (so I'll take it as a yes), and she quit smoking on Monday. 
So hey she says she doesn't do 'stupid shit' any more so that sounds like a ++ to me.

Strike one. She picks up and  I say is Daniel there. 
She says... ""Danielle ?"".
I wanted to punch myself right there for THAT mistake.

Ok obvious that i am nervous. 


So we talked for maybe 2 minutes. And man did I screw up everything I was gonna ask her.
I said I was wondering if you are free this weekend. STUPID ME
I  have a day off tomorrow and thursday those were the days I meant to ask about.
So i had to roll with it, because she said Oh yeah sure I got nothing to do on the weekend.

 Saturday seems like the day . And we are going to go to the new bridge in town down on the sacramento river with the cafe. It seems to be a good date location.

She wants me to pick her up so I have a little time to figure out how to get to her house. 
I'll be calling her tomorrow after she gets out of school at 1:30. Maybe this time I won't sound like such a jackass.

Man not only does she looks good shes got a really hot voice.

I'll hope I do better with tomorrows call.

EB's first day as a security guard or gaurd as he spelt it---

So i started my job as a secuirty gaurd the other day,

2 days i gaurd a school construction site in north tacoma, the other 2 days i gaurd a construction site on fucking Hill Top in tacoma, all i get is a flashlight, not allowed to use force, i get a company cell phone while im at the school, but while im on gaurd on hill top, nah, they dont think i need a cell phone, if anything happens (like say me getting shot by fucking gang members) then i can drive down the street untill i find a payphone...


So its my first day on the job, i have to stay overnight at a construction site of a school in tacoma, at about 3 am 3 teenagers sneak onto the site. i dont know what to do, i want them to stop but if i act like a cop then they'll just run, so i try to think of something clever ""STOP, IN THE NAME OF THE LAW"" They run, ""STOP, IM LONELY I JUST WANT TO TALK, IVE BEEN OUT HERE FOR 8 HOURS, COME ON GUYS IM PROBABLY YOUNGER THAN YOU"" They keep running, I started chasing them while singing Sabotage from Beastie Boys, they jumped the fence, i jump onto the fence and start singing that part from Phantom of the Opera ""YOU WILL CURSE THE DAY YOU DID NOT DOOO, ALL, THAT THE SECURITY GAURD ASKED OF YOUUU. They stopped to look back at me, i pretended to fall onto the ground and say into my cellphone, ""OFFICER DOWN OFFICER DOWN I NEED BACK UP, I NEED AIR SUPPORT, THEY HAVE GUNS, I REPEAT 3 HIGHFLYERS IN SECTOR 9 LEVEL 2"" They start running again.

Tired, but somehow not sleepy.
 Got next to no sleep, and drug my ass to school. I got to buy books tomorrow and read 30 something pages by wednesday morning. Not a good start as I have work tomorrow afternoon/night. I'll have to do my damnedest to wake up early and buy my shit at the bookstore.
 My english teacher is kinda hot. Not 19 year old McHotty, but more along the lines of a definately single 20something year old teacher who didn't wear a bra on the first day. Strangely I think I caught her looking my way more than a few times during the in class writing assignment. Maybe it was just my hair that she couldn't stop looking at or a strange coincidence.

 I went home during my layover between classes and fell asleep after eating. I forgot to call that girl because I was too damn tired, and I just wasn't really in the mood to talk on the phone so it might have been all for the best. I woke up just in time to make it back to school for my Japanese 2 class. It's good too see some familiar people. I asked around and it seems like everyone has already gotten their grades while I still am looking in the mail box everyday for them to come. I'll have to check with administration now because this is bullshit. They send me all sorts of shit I don't want but they can't send me my grades?

 So I got out of japanese and had to race home and eat again because I was starving and low on energy. My cat wanted some food ( I guess whats what the meowing was about) but to my dismay there was no food left. FUCK now thats another thing I got to take care of. I had no time to spare and I had to run to work because the fuckers have me scheduled to close. 

It was a layed back night though. I watched the oven and just kept things clean. I was glad to finally get home. Then I made the mistake of watching tv. I always get stuck watching the History Channel and I always want to see the program all the way to the end. It was on the atomic bombs and the war on japan. Then I started playing SC 2. Damn I am rusty. The AI was handing me my ass over and over again. But I refuse to take the difficulty down from its highest level. 
I will be ready for nads.

I will call this girl tomororw (today) for sure though. I really wanted to call already, but I'm busy as shit and I'd rather have some free time to make the call than try and squeeze it inbetween everything.
oookay now I'm sleepy. 
My ass is crash landing on my bed like an Air France flight to Toronto."

"event","The phone rang this afternoon at 4pm. It was my boss asking me where I was. I guess I was late for work.
I crawled out of bed and got to work at about 4:30. They don't bother writing me up or scolding me or anything since I don't waste labor. So I guess I started the day on a bad foot with that. I was supposta wake up early and go buy a new backpack and some binders. Instead I'll have to carry my busted ass backpack with one arm strap and hope that the first day hand outs are minimal.

So at about 6 a group comes in and places an order. I was in the mood to try and earn a tip by butternig up guests. So I give them a 4 dollar off coupon and be overly friendly (if there is really such a thing). I guess it didn't work as they didn't offer anything, but they said thanks and that I was 'awesome' (I think they said awesome or something to that effect). I hadn't given up though. I checked up on them and let them know when their food was coming and I even brought out the food and all the extra little stuff that they could need. I checked on them one last time before taking my break. They seemed all finished and they thanked me once more. 

It seemed like a lost cause for a tip, but thats just the way it goes in fast food. Nobody tips, we obviously don't do enough work to deserve one (roll eyes smiley goes here). So I sit down on my break and the next thing I know someone comes up right behind me and startles me. It was the woman from the table I was 'working'. I thought she was coming over to thank me and give me a tip. Instead she said that the girl over at the table wanted me to give this to you. It was the table number and on the back was
Danielle
and her phone number.

She then told me that she is a very nice girl and I seemed like a very nice boy and she urged me to call her.  I was taken by surprise and quickly said 'oh thank you, I sure will'. My mind was racing to remember if there was a girl at the table. Sure enough I saw a pretty damn fine girl sitting over at the table looking my way. 

Must have been my lucky day. 

Anyways I had to close at work so there was no way I was going to be able to give her a call tonight and all the guys and the girl there said that calling right after getting the number is not the right move. They told me to make her wait.  So it was a unanimous decision that I should hold off on a call. 

Seeing how I don't ever get put in this position I wasn't sure how to handle the situation on the phone. So now I got a little time to think it over.  I think the first step would be deciding on a day to hang out and see how it works out. I'm trying not to approach this as a potential bf/gf situation, but rather as a see if I can make friends with her and share common interests (if there are any). That way I'm not trying to think like a boyfriend and I'll just keep an eye on how she respondes to me. If some does happen then it will happen  because she wants it to happen and I'll just roll with whatever.

Anyways. Today classes begin (7 hours from now). I feel tired and I hope to break my habit of falling asleep in my classes. I just have two classes and then I'll have some time in the afternoon to take care of stuff. I'll probably give her a call then and see what days she is available this week and see if we both have openings. Shit, then I got to buy books. I imagine the line will be so long it will run down the book aisles. I won't need to buy a Japanese book though since we will be using the second part of the book I bought last semester. 

Then I have my last class Jap 2 and then I gotta book it back to work for another closing shift.
Not a lot of time to relax. I got to get to sleep. I didn't spellcheck this either so if a work is missing or something is missplaced, then you get to play the guessing game: ""What the fuck was he trying to tyep!!""."

"event","I talked to Wook, and Nads and Moranis err Heamon Zero and Reginald (SP?) on the phone not too long ago.
Wook sure is a swell guy but he seemed to have to keep his focus on shibby as he sounded to be a little out of controll. Nads was of course calm and cool, and I was a little flustered and tried to keep the conversation flow going. I choked when I tried to pronounce the name Rick Moranis. It was all right though as nads once again proved to be a swell guy and I enjoyed his wit. 
Heamon ZERO was very drunk but he was very talkative. I don't think it was a drunken ramble rather than it was a quick recap of the metric system and the universe. There was a fried chicken /watermelon joke in there I really liked. I listened to every word he said and he sounds like one smart dude.
 He handed me off to Reginald and we chatted for a bit. I didn't catch his forum name and I'm not sure he knew me from the boards, but that didn't matter. 
 Somehow I ended up with wook again and he was still flustered, and he played the ""do a barrelroll"" clip for me. Awesome. Got laughs all around. He had to hand the phone off again due to shibby. I then finished up the conversation with Haemon Zero again. He said everyone had run outside and said I should call back in a couple of minutes, but I didn't want to intrude any further (nor rack up a big long distance bill) so we said or farewells. 

So everyone there take it easy and have fun. Don't forget to take pix for us all to see and photoshop.
Hope to see you guys at WookPAX 2"

"event","I saw EPS III.
This had to be one of the worst theatrical experiences I've had.

The temp was 101  when we left to see the movie at about 930. We had to wait in line that wrapped around the building. They had like 2 people working at the theater on a Friday night. One selling tickets and one keeping the crowd in check.
So I was already sweating up a storm by the time we got inside. The movie was to start at 955 and by the time we had our tickets it was 10 (yay for math). Lucky for us the movie hadn't started yet, but our theater was really warm. It would stay this way for another 30 minutes. Movie still hasn't started and its REALLY warm. Then it did start and we were greated by the WORST fucking movie commercials I've ever had to suffer through, thankfully no Anti Piracy commercial though. Then eventually the movie came on. By that time I was already uncomfortable in my chair and could not find a position to relieve the pain in my back.

So the movie. It just didn't do it for me. I know something in me told me I HAD to go see starwars but something about me just didn't care for it. I must say from Eps. I to III they all rank the same for me. Kinda meh, but not sucky. Sure the violence was heavier in this one, but I just really didn't dig  the whole movie. I left the theater thinking ""Well, now I know how star wars begins, but I still don't care to go and see the older 3 movies"". I think I fail at being a nerd. Mmm but I still enjoy Ms. Portman. 

I'm looking for pictures from comic con on the forums but the forums are lifeless.  Who here knows someone there and has pictures of the wacky antics?"

"event","I love having a day off. I call them sleep days now. 16 hours asleep and I still get that foggy feeling when I get out of bed. Takes about 30 minutes to shake it. The weather here (as it is mostly everywhere now) is hot hot HOT. 

If I didn't have A/C in my car I would probably sweat instantly and stick to my seats. The steeringwheel is the hottest thing on earth and I should probably buy a cover for it but I don't exactly know what I would like on it. Shitty gas prices aren't moving either, so I'll have to bite the bullet and fill up the tank.

School should be starting in about a month so I hope A: I get a fin aid check BEFORE I have to go buy books and B: They finally send me my grades, so I can outline what I have left to accomplish. 
I'll have to see a councelor too about transfering down to the Sacramento area. 

My moms been calling me alot as of late as she wants me to come down to visit her. It just feels like it will be awkward though as she has moved in with her boyfriend and says I can come stay in his guest room if I visit. I was hoping Mom was going to get her own appartment, but I guess if things are easier this way then I guess you can't blame her for not taking the easier road. I just hope things don't go sour.

I stole matches from work. Fire FIRE! I am now burning a candle, and it is soothing.

I will be going to see EPS III tonight. It should be fun. Man but its 106 outside STILL (8:30 PM). I hope this temp thing is just broken. I could use some shorts too, but I fear my pale white legs would reflect the sun light into the eyes of passer-bys and blind them. 

Does anyone else have a jar or baggie or any other coin storage device full of lose change? What the hell am I going to do with a pile of dimes and nickles? Lets not mention the pennies.

I bought the Clerks Animated series. Good stuff. The commentary was great too, but the Clerks the animated movie they mention at the end of the last episode, doesn't seem to have happened. It kinda bums me out.

See ya 'round"

It was smashed. 
<img SRC=http://webpages.charter.net/brian140/powersupply.jpg>
I called and complained that it was a waste of my time and money to keep sending back parts if they arrive in terrible condition. I was actually considering maybe just keeping this one. So I went to test it and realized I couldn't physically install it in the case due to the damage.

So now I wait again. Another week on the old Pentium Celeron and god does it bug the shit out of me how slow it is.
Oh and they credited me 20 dollars for the shipping costs so that was a plus. 

Also I hate people who BITCH you out if you say god damn(it) around them. If you be polite and ask me to please not say that, then we are cool. But when you say 'Hey! Watch your motherfucking mouth', then we have started on the wrong foot, and I am not likely going to stop (unless they have a fucking gun or knife). Let's face it people, not everybody has the same 'god' so unless I say FUCK JESUS CHRIST THAT LITTLE DICK then just scale back that retort, and  give it a passive feel. Ya dig?"

"event","I have been told by numerous people I installed my powersupply upside-down.
So tonight I decide to flip it around. Simple enough, and no problems.
It took maybe 10 mins tops with all the wire sorting stuff. 
I plug it in then as soon as I plug the monitor cable in the powersupply blows up in my face.

Yup. Power button does nothing. Ethernet ports not lit up. I can't assess the damage,but I can only hope that the powersupply was the only thing that got fried. After taking the powersupply out a small piece of metal fell out of the unit.

http://webpages.charter.net/brian140/wtf.jpg

Well hello there loose metal piece. What were you doing floating around inside my powersupply?

Long story short, I am posting from my OLD computer, my monitor is fine (well I don't know about the DVI port yet) I am RMAing the powersupply back for a replacement, if I didn't flip it upside down maybe the metal piece wouldn't have blown anything up.

My eyes hurt. I want to sleep. But the body won't let me.
I got 9 fucking messages on the answering machine today. I haven't listened to them but if you don't push the play button the damn machine will just BEEP and BEEP and BEEP nonstop and it drives me mad!

I hope it rains, its not pleasant when you are sweating at work. Or at home. Or sleeping. Generally whenever.
Did I mention I am playing halflife? It is hard, the AI is fucking brilliant. But god damnit how am I going to finish the game if I can't get past a couple of gaurds with heavy firearms.
Plus I really suck at FPS games, and the auto aim feels like cheating. But I need it !

I went to AM/PM after work to go buy one of those big ass sodas for like 79 cents and their soda machine is in the middle of the parking lot. I walk inside and half the store is taped off cuz they are tearing shit up. I look around and see 2 shady guys just...standing around, not talking or anything, just standing. A girl at the register saying "" I'm nut drunk dood, for realz"". And the obligitory guy driving by in his car going ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"".
I leave and drive across the street to raleys, and I can't believe that kids think it is actually cool to just park in the raleys parking lot blasting their beats and starring down everyone that enters or exits the store. It's an absolute waste of time and for god sakes ITS RALEYS! A fucking supermarket for godsakes.

I always feel weird signing these papers and telling this all this information that I hardly even know. I'm sure I sounded stupid when I asked what total assets was. She told me its the total worth of everything I own. So I worked it out in my head and though ""if I pawned all my shit off how much would I get?"". Only 4000. I hope thats not a bad thing that my ass can be bought and sold for a low low price.

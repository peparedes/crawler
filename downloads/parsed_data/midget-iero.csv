"event","The other night I ate an entire pizza by myself.  I was supposed to be waiting for Matt but he was late and I was hungry.  That's why I didn't eat any of the pizza you had Matty.  

Jersey was inducted into the adult world the other day.  I swear it wasn't my fault.  Matt was taunting me and I just couldn't help myself.  I think she was too busy chewing on my favourite belt to pay attention, but she still probably got an eyeful ;)

I sent in some new designs for shirts for s//c and I'm waiting for the samples to come back.  I've got one that's all about the number of the beast that I think you'll really like Zacky.  I show you the samples if they ever fucking show up.  

Oh get this.  I came home from Matt's the other day and there's a fucking chunk missing out of one of the posts on my porch.  There was a note attached to the front door too.

<i>Dear Frankie,
I stopped by to pick up a couple of things I left when I moved out, but I got hungry, had a bite (of your porch) and left.  I'll come back some other time and hopefully you won't be too caught up with that big guy.  I want to talk.  I miss you baby.

Love Always,
Jamia</i>

Okay first off, SHE TOOK A BITE OUT OF MY FUCKING PORCH!  WTF?  Second, ""that big guy""?  Umm, hi bitch, his name is MATT and he's my BOYFRIEND.  He's hardly just some random guy.  Third, no.  I will never get together with her as long as I live.

Yesterday I went over to see Gerard and he gave me PRESENTS!  I love presents!  He got me twizzlers and a cute little bear AND he gave me this amazing charcoal drawing.  Seriously, when My Chem ends, Gerard is going to be the next Monet/Van Gogh/Dali/[insert name of other super famous artists here].

PS, Matty, apparently little Mikey Way's a bit scared of you so we're going to have to get him good at the big stupid dinner.  Also, advance warning, ignore Ray.  He's actually a really nice guy, trapped in the body of a nagging old lady.  Or maybe he's a nagging old lady trapped in the body of a nice guy?  I don't know.  Either way, don't listen to him.  ILU baybee.  Oh and I'm going to need another 'demonstration' later.  I seem to have completely forgotten what you showed me last night.  Silly me!"

Gerard and I got a puppy from Skiba.  She's adorable and I insisted on called her Jersey, b/c hi...best place in the world.  Gerard dropped her off the other day while he went to look at his new place.  Matt spent about an hour chasing her around the backyard until she got smart and turned around and lunged at him.  <s>He totally screamed like a little girl</s> I love you baby.  Although I'm not going to ask you do THAT again for a while.  I think my back is permanently scarred.  It was totally worth it though.

I haven't worked out in a long time, but I guess being with Matt is kind of a workout in itself.  

I saw the trailer for our DVD the other day too.  God that brought back a lot of memories.  March 21st people!"

In other news, I kicked Jamia out.  She wouldn't stop eating the furniture and I just don't have the funds to replace the entire living room once a week.  I also didn't notice until this morning but that BITCH took my last package of twizzlers with her.  Why I didn't fire her fat ass out of the house months ago is beyond me.

I even had some beef jerky in the cupboard <s>which I totally didn't buy at the corner store while he was on his way over</s>  He showed me his knife fight scars and I showed him the tattoo on my thigh (with near disastrous results).  And then we ate popcorn and watched The Nightmare Before Christmas.  My FAVOURITE movie ever.  E. V. E. R.  Too bad <s>Lardo</s> Jamia had to come home half way through and ruin it.

In other news, Gerard, I think you and I need to get together and write a few more songs.  I've been feeling creative of late.

It was awful up until the point where we ended up 'accidentally' in Huntington Beach California.  Oddly enough we got lost and ended up driving past Matt Shadows' house, like 6 times.  Then he came out and threatened to smash my poor little Honda with a baseball bat so we got unlost really fast.  I could see the warmth in his eyes though.  The only other good part of that whole experience was that in Vegas there was a twizzlers booth.  Heaven.  Absolute heaven.  They even had those creme-filled ones that aren't made anymore.  And the mixed berry peely ones.  Omg I'm drooling again.  

Jeff, I'm REALLY sorry I missed your bbq on friday.  I hope you guys had a great time without me (pssht like that's possible, you missed me)

I was in New York all day today hanging out with the Ways.  Mikey and <s>the whore</s> <s>Bitchlicia</s> Alicia finally came back from the From First To Last tour.  I 'misplaced' her MAC Carbon eyeshadow in their bathroom last night.  Apparently she nearly had a heartattack this morning when she only had enough powder left on her brush to do one coat.  Oops *gigglesnort*.

I keep forgetting to tell you guys about my christmas present from Gerard too.  He went away to Japan for three weeks (and I missed him terribly) and I'd asked him to bring me back a pair of those skeleton pjs for christmas b/c well I love skeletons and pjs.  So Gerard comes back from Japan and he's like ""I HAVE YOUR PRESENT FRANKIE!""  I freak out, rip it open and what's inside?!?!  PYJAMAS!  BUT!  I pull them out.  Put them on and they're FREAKING HELLO KITTY IN A FROG SUIT PJS.  :| haha Gerard.  ha ha.  I know I'm small and child like but still.  Not cool.  I wear them anyway, b/c they're SUPER cute.  But don't tell Gerard.  Or any one else.

Tomorrow...Hot Topic with Gerard and Mikey <s>and the bitch</s>.  I need a new Thrice hoodie and maybe a new velcro wallet.  

Pierre!  David!  You two need to let me know when you're coming down for a visit!  Gerard's apartment is right by a donut shop and a Coldstone's (ice cream place) so we're SET!  Hollaback girls!"

"event","I'm sick and NOT happy about it.  Jamia keeps trying to make me soup but she never gets it into the bowl.  Apparently it's all mysteriously disappearing down her throat.  

Shadows hasn't called me in 4 days, 14 hours and 37 minutes.  Last time we talked he said I shouldn't come to his house anymore.  Something about scaring Val and getting my ass bitten by his dog, Bruiser.  He's so funny.  

Pierre promised me a donut day at Krispy Kreme when him and David come for a visit.  I CAN'T WAIT!  HURRY UP YOU TWO!  

I need to go lay down again.  Ugh, head hurts.  I wish Mikey would come and take care of me instead of spending time with his gold digger."

"event","So I'm in Hot Topic today right?  I took <s>the pig</s> Jamia with me b/c she'll literally eat the couch if I leave her at home alone.  I'm browsing the velcro wallets and out of nowhere this girl runs over to me and is all ""OH MY GOD!  Aren't you Zacky Vengeance?""  EXCUSE ME?  I'M FRANK FUCKING IERO AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT WOMAN.  Please, as IF that Pig Fetus is as hot as I am.  And his real last name is Baker.  No wonder he doesn't like to tell people that.  How rockstar can you be if your last name is Baker?  Pfft.  To think he gets to spend 24/7 in the presence of the god that is M. Shadows.  He so isn't worthy.  I don't get how Matt looks as good as he does.  I'm mean I've tried EVERYTHING short of steroids and my arms look like toothpicks next to his.  Damn my small, girlish frame and fat stomach.  Jamia says she likes that I'm pudgy, but I think she's secretly just fantasizing about frying me up and eating me for breakfast.  

I went for a walk in North Jersey today.  A couple of guys tried to shoot me and then I went and got a cannoli from one of the local bakeries.  There seriously isn't any better place on Earth than Jersey.  I love Jersey.  If you think you live in a place better than Jersey, you are WRONG.  I wish Gerard and Mikey still lived here though.  But their stupid girlfriends wanted to move to New York.  Pfft.  I know that the Ways still love me the most.  Gerard lets me sit in his lap and Mikey ALWAYS lets me drink his coffee.  Bet you can't say the same, Kat and Alicia.  Last night I ate an entire carton of Twizzlers.  Ray says eating won't make things better but what does he know.  Him and his stupid hair cut.  Seriously, who has the same hair for 4 years?  Someone who isn't creative, that's who.  I think he just likes to flaunt the fact that he's not balding.  I'm not either, STOP LOOKING AT MY HEAD!

Well I guess I should wrap this up.  I have some gloves that I need to cut the fingers off of, my nails need painting and I have to organize my eye makeup drawer again.  Maybe I'll call Mikey and see if he wants to go for coffee and maybe an eyebrow waxing.  That boy's are atrocious.

Keep the faith, ya'lll"

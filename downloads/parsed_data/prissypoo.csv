"event","Once you are tagged you must write about 6 weird habits/things you have/do. In the end, you need to choose the next six people to be tagged and list their names.

1.  I hate odd numbers.  The Queen can relate, I think... we discussed this one night with Mr. Shorts.  I have to count things and if they aren't in even numbers I have to recount so that the number of times I counted them is even.  I never did claim to be stable.

2.  I have to fold my socks myself when they come out of the dryer.  If anyone else folds them, I throw them back in the wash, I simply cannot wear them.

3.  I love cabbies.  I was in Chicago on training last week and took about a billion cabs and it was fabulous.  I did find it interesting that they were all complete ass-bags until I tipped them and then they were falling all over themselves to help me out of the cab.  Huh.

4.  When I'm home by myself, I put on a tank top and some underwear and dance around my apartment like a lunatic.  I can't let anyone know because they'll think it's weird.  But you won't tell anyone, I'm sure.

5.  I only write in black ink.  I used to love blue pens until one exploded in my bookbag, ruining my secret public journal.  Now, I loathe them.

6.  When my glasses start to slide down my nose, instead of pushing them up with my hands, I wrinkle my nose until they make their way back up.  It used to be so I didn't get extra dirt on my face from my hands but now I think I'm getting wrinkles on my forehead.  Either way, when people see me do it, they think I have a tic.

I don't know anyone else on livejournal that hasn't been tagged.  Plus, after reading all this weird crap about me, they will most likely pretend they don't know me.

"event","Ah, my weekend.  How exhausting it was.

As most of you know, I never go out.  Never.  If I do, it's a romp at goth night and I'm home by one at the latest.  But I decided to go out on Friday... and Saturday... and Sunday.

Sheesh.

On Friday, I went to the Monkey with the Horse Whisperer and her equestrian friends.  They talked horse talk and it completely confused me.  But we got to the bar and talked for a bit and the Fireman eventually showed up to work the door.  It rained so they cut him early... Then Ju-Ju Bee called and asked to borrow my apartment for the weekend.  Since I think everyone needs a hideaway and I adore my Ju-Ju, of course I said yes.  She came and picked me up to get my keys and after I showed her the apartment she took me back to the Monkey.  Once I got back, the Fireman and his best friend wanted to head over to Guido's.... One great thing about dating the Fireman, I never have to pay for cover or drinks at the bars he works at.  Ah, perks.  So we went to Guido's and the Fireman and the entourage we brought along drank excessively.  And just when the Fireman says he's ready to go home, someone opened their big mouth and suggested a crawl to the Dive.  So we go, more shots were consumed, I danced my ass off, the Fireman drank his ass off, and a good time was had by all.  I heard the milkshake song, I was muy happy.

Then on Saturday, I wanted to go shake it some more.  So I called Mr. Shorts since it's been far too long since he and I did anything together.  I met him with his fan club at Jupiter's where he was playing with his new gadget.  I'm glad to see the Zoloft didn't make him any less of a nerd.  We eventually head over to C-Street where the Horse Whisperer is waiting and we danced for a bit.  Ju and Bu showed up, Ju looked FABULOUS... and they promised post-it notes suggesting apartment improvements for me.  I can hardly wait.

Mr. Shorts and I left around 1:30 to get some grub and then I dropped him at his chick-mobile and went to get the Fireman who was dreamy, as usual.  Have I mentioned that I'm completely over the moon for this guy?  Oh, he's just fabulous... no really, he's perfect.  *sigh*

Sunday, I went to Nargile to keep the Fireman company at his happy hour shift.  We stayed and played pool and then we went home and talked until far too late.  But he's wonderful so I don't mind losing sleep.  And that was that.

God I'm tired.  Which means I'm old.  *sigh* again.

Everyone is irritating me, nothing is going right, no one is noticing the good stuff I'm doing, only the bad stuff.... I should have stayed in bed with the Fireman all day... that would have been lovely.

I'm getting frustrated at people lately.  I'm trying to help people but they aren't so much helping themselves.  Which pisses me off.  But that's life I suppose.

I went to dinner with Ju-Ju Bee and Bu on Monday... they were fabulous.  We went to this Chinese food buffet... it was.... interesting.  The pudding was outstanding.  And they had meat on sticks.  That makes a good meal in my book.

The Fireman started smoking again.  He quit five years ago and didn't pick another one up until last week.  It sort of bothers me which is weird since both the Bookworm and the Philosopher smoked like chimneys.  But I love the Fireman... I don't want him to smoke.  Blah.

So it's been a day.  Happy hour at the basement of Nargile is tonight, the Fireman bartends.  I'll be there 'till nine... feel free to come out.  I promise I'll be in a better mood... and we can play some pool!

So all of you know that I'm always concerned about how I get bored with guys really easily.  I always warn them that this happens, it happens and they get pissed.  But I don't think it's boredom that makes me run.

I dated the Ex for several years.  During that relationship, I realized all the things I wanted and didn't want in a mate.  I was thinking about the past few guys that ""I got bored with"" and realized it wasn't boredom at all... I was seeing qualities in them that I saw in the Ex.  All the things that made me miserable with the Ex were showing up individually in the people I was dating.  One was too clingy... just like the Ex.  One was too practical... just like the Ex.  One was too emotional... a pansy, really... just like the Ex.  And I also realized that the reason the Fireman has a better chance than any of them is because he's none of those things.  He's not too clingy, but affectionate enough to let me know he loves me... He's not so practical that he'd ignore his heart but never too emotional to listen to reason... And he's the manliest man I know and still cooks for me. He's just about perfect.  And I think I'm in love... *sigh*

So that's that.  Ooh, and only 62 days 'til my birthday!

"event","Hello my lovelies... I miss you all.

Life is good lately.  The Bookworm and I have come to a good place of friendship and mutual shoulders to cry on.  Since the way things ended between us was so weird, it's nice to be able to talk with him about life.  I IM'd the Philosopher a few nights ago... told him that I was thinking about him and hoped he was well.  Asked if he wanted to do dinner but he said it's still too soon.  I miss my friend.  But maybe soon he'll forgive me and I can regain the best part of our relationship while leaving behind what made me run in the first place.  Either way, I hope he's well.

Ummmm.... let's see... The Fireman and I are doing well.  I'm falling pretty hard I think.  I'm pretty concerned about various issues that I've talked extensively about to Mr. Shorts and the Bookworm.  They offer advice, they offer to crack skulls... but mostly they just listen and that's nice.

So Mr. Shorts is depressed.  Let's all give him a round of applause!  He's on meds now and I think he may actually like life again soon... I hope so.  He's one of the best people I know... even though I'm a total bitch to him.  He's good people.

I think I'm going to plan an evening this weekend... who's up for shaking some tailfather at C-Street? (show of hands please...) After we dance, we can end up at the Monkey and those of you who have not yet met the Fireman can do so.  I assure you, he's fabulous.  And dreamy. *sigh*

The Fireman was on call tonight.  And since the storms were so bad, he was out for five hours in it, working his ass off.  He comes home, wakes me up to talk about his night, and now I can't get back to sleep.  I'm thinking about the past few months.  Specifically, the Bookworm, the Philosopher, and Chuckles.

I was thinking about how I get bored sooooo easily... and how to prevent that in the future.  There was nothing wrong with any of these people really... I just freak out and bail.  Can't change the past though, gotta move on.

The Bookworm and I had some trouble after we stopped seeing each other.  I couldn't be around him much and he wanted to be around someone else... but lately he and I talk more and I think we're going to be friends... Maybe not great friends, but certainly not enemies.

The Philosopher is a good kid.  I think about him a lot... and I do miss him.  He made me laugh at the stupidest shit, that no one else understood.  He and I were good friends, moving to something more serious.  But I told him that I fuck everything up.  And eventually, it was fucked up.  I hope he doesn't stay mad.  I hope he's having fun somewhere... I can picture him now, at his favorite bar, drinking the hell out of a Pabst or an Old Style... and being charming... as he always was.

Chuckles was and is the funniest person I've ever met.  He and I had the same stupid pop-culture interests... ah the Simpson's trivia that man put up with.  He's a good guy, really.  But he was extremely emotional... and I am not an emotional gal.  So that was that.

So with these three people, I've learned a lot, done a lot, seen a lot... I'm no closer to figuring out what's wrong with me... but I don't think I'd change it all.  I'm older and wiser because of them, I suppose... so I'm greatful.

John Mayer is so wise... ""I wish I could figure out what's wrong with me, so I can say this is the way that I used to be.  There's no substitute for time.""

Nothing new going on lately I don't think... My Mom's birthday is next week, gotta get her something.  I'm taking the Fireman to meet her, that should be interesting.  He met my insane sister last night and he still likes me.  It must be true love.

The Golden Girls is good TV.

Wow.  And I've reached a new level of boredom.

So dating the Fireman has made me a bit more assertive at work... he's teaching me how to stick up for myself.  I've been a sucker, doing whatever anybody asks me to do.  So the Fireman has been teaching me to say no.  I'm getting good at it.  NO.  See?  I'm getting better everyday.

OK, I'm off to Mr. Shorts' house.  Miss me.

I can read your thoughts right now.

So anyhoo, I'm updating.  There are new developments.  Recently (very recently, in fact) I started dating someone new.  His nickname was going to be DoorMonkey but lately I think The Fireman is a better nickname.  So that's it.  He's a great guy... funny, smart, attractive, hard working... and he's not a pansy.  Thank God.  I hope you all get to meet him soon.  He has five jobs so it's tough to go out with him unless I plan waaaaaay in advance... but you will all meet him soon, I promise.  I'm pretty smitten myself.

Work has been nuts as usual.  The big project that had me staying late and losing sleep has tapered off quite a bit so I don't freak out about that much... but there's other stuff that is time-consuming that I wish I could pawn off on other people... but the time I would devote to finding those people would probably exceed the time it would take to just do it myself.  So I'll do it... because I'm a sucker.

It's Goth Night!  Roll call, who's coming out?  Carrie-Bear, you need to come... remember last week when you wished you had come out?.... Don't let that happen again...

I hope to see you all tonight!

I'm really sorry for being so flaky with this journal.  Work has been more crazy than you can imagine.  But I got my paycheck today and it had a billion hours of overtime on it... so that's something.

Basically, I'm ditching everyone for a while... with the exception of Goth Night, I'm not doing anything with anyone.  I'm going through some bad stuff right now and really just need to sit by myself for a moment.  I've lost some people I was close to and that hurts.  But if my life goes the way I think it will, it's for the best.

So at work, I'm doing about a thousand jobs.  Two days ago, my boss comes to me and says, ""are we behind on your equipment report?""... I say, ""yeah, I had to make sure the dish addresses got entered so the boys could get their bonuses.""  He then says, ""could you try to get that updated?""... So I'm feeling like shit, thinking that the managers are beginning to think I can't handle the job.  Two hours later the same boss comes up to me and says, ""sometime next week, could you give me a list of all the jobs you're doing? We're overworking you and I think we can give some of the menial tasks to other people to do, we need you to do the important stuff.""  So that made me feel better, at least someone in the world knows I'm busting my ass for this company.

Goth Night was lovely... Carrie-Bear came, Ju-Ju came, Pooky was there, as well as the usual crew of Goth Nighters... and the Queen came! YAY!  I haven't seen her in forever... the 'roo is doing well fortunately... We didn't stay late, I had an early meeting as usual... but the night was lots 'o fun... even funky goth was there!

OK, I'm going back to work... I think someone is taking me out to lunch today, some sort of ""we appreciate you"" thing... they'd better appreciate me... I'm not losing sleep and my social life for nothing...

The Relay was tons 'o fun... Bu and Ju and I walked our asses off... and I found that cheese brats are very tasty.  Yum.  I felt really good walking for a good cause... it was strange spending a month begging people to give me money.  But it was totally worth it when I was walking around that track.  I got to hang out with Bu and Ju and the rest of the crew (that's a great rhyme!) which I rarely get to do... so it was a great experience.  Thanks Bu and Ju for including me... I had a blast.

We played some volleyball last night... we couldn't get a court because some people are hogs... but we played in a circle.  The circle of life.

Goth Night was fun this week... I wore a dangerously short skirt and danced till I couldn't dance no more.  All in all, a fun evening.  The Winesnob capped off the night by telling me that he was going out for Mom's weekend on Saturday so he could see what the girls would look like as they got older.  He's basing his next girlfriend on the looks of their mother.  I find that disgusting.  But to each his own.

Anyhoo... Mr. Shorts and I will be doing a little home improvement soon.  In the house I shared with the Ex, I decorated everything... I had a real talent for it, actually... so now I'm lending my expertise... because I'm nice.

I'm staying in tonight, so tired after this week's festivities... so feel free to call but I won't answer... nothing personal, just bidness.

I went out with Ju-Ju Bee last night and some of her friends... it was fan-tas-tic.  We ate and did some bargain shopping at Dollar Tree and then went to the sand volleyball courts to see who's toughest.  I did not win.  But I had so much fun... Bu is my new favorite person, he's fabulous.  And Pooky really came through for us during the game, I was impressed at his effort...

Goth Night was lovely as usual... The Queen didn't come to Mr. Shorts' before festivities so we were worried but she showed up and looked wonderful, as she usually does.  I shook it for awhile but got tired and left early... but not before finally meeting JoeZ... he caught me on the way out though, so I fear I was rude... my apologies.

P.S. My arm is killing me from Volleyball and there is still sand in every orifice of my body.  I took a shower but it just made the sand angry... And I have a bite-sized bruise on my leg from Ju-Ju Bee... I'm considering a lawsuit... ;)."

But don't see it if you've just broken up with someone, you'll just get sad that the procedure they do in the movie isn't really available... at least at first.  Then, after the movie is over, you're just so happy that you have all these memories that you're grateful it's not available.  But you still shouldn't see it if you've just lost someone you love.  Anyhoo, he and I decided to take a trip together this year... I'm wanting to see the four corners and the grand canyon... or New York.  I have a friend at work who has family in New York City... she has offered their services as a tour guide.  So who knows where we'll go... but I'll send postcards, I promise.

Goth Night was OK this week... I didn't see JoeZ make an appearance though.  It's probably just as well, they had a band at Goth Night... they NEVER have bands at Goth Night... it was weird.  At any rate, Mr. Shorts and I left early...

After that, we had bratwurst and I took a sleepy... and around midnight, we went to C-Street... as soon as we got there, we saw Ju-Ju Bee and Bu walking up to the door... and the fun began.  Seeing Ju-Ju Bee in her own environment was fantastic.  She was like a queen, reining over all her subjects.  It was amazing.  And Bu was simply delicious.  I shook my tailfeather massive amounts.  This creepy guy came up to me and hit on me briefly before Ju-Ju called for me and I got to walk away from him.  He was on the dance floor later so I had to fondle Mr. Shorts a bit to show the creepy guy that I was not available... and then we went home...

Good Times.

And apparently it's Claw-Diggity's birthday this Saturday... Ju-Ju invited Mr. Shorts and I out for the festivities... can't wait, Ju-Ju...

Van...Band...Guy.  *sigh* Talk about yum.  He's just as hot as he ever was... I wonder if he's still seeing that girl... I'm way prettier than she is... he must be mine.  I didn't talk to him or anything but I think he was checking me out a bit... can't ever be sure, people can be looking elsewhere but your desperate mind imagines them looking at you... All I know is that I was imagining lots of stuff later that night.

I left before closing, much to the dismay of the WineSnob.  He wants to scientifically interview me.  Basically, my outgoing voicemail message says something about bad dates, you should call and listen.  So, because of that, he wants to interview me.  He thinks I'm dating the wrong people and that it all has to do with evolution... or something.  I think he just wants to probe me...

Anyhoo, Mr. Shorts, the Queen, ArmyGoth, myself and possibly the Temptress are all going to Chi-town tonight... I can hardly wait, I love Chicago at night.

Oh, and some random guy asked for my phone number at the laundromat this morning... he was awfully cute....

And before I forget... Carrie-Bear is alive and well!  She called me last night and stopped by my apartment to visit... She looks lovely.  She even helped me bring in my groceries.  I bought too much, a lesson should be learned about grocery shopping after an awful day... I wanted to eat the entire Sara Lee frozen treat section.

Goth night was fun this week... the Bookworm came late, as usual... we had pre-festivities (brief as they were) at Mr. Shorts' house... and I shook my tailfeather.

The WineSnob kept asking the Bookworm about his poker strategies... I don't think the WineSnob realizes that the Bookworm has been playing poker since he was a kid, you can't teach something like that in one conversation.  The WineSnob also told the Bookworm that I liked him... and advised the Bookworm to not lead me on if he didn't like me.  That was very protective of WineSnob, I do appreciate the thought.  And the Cradle-Robber (who I think is now called Jesus...) also told the Bookworm I was hot for him... you guys love to torture me.

So, that's pretty much it.  The Bookworm left this morning for a poker tournament in Tunica... my Christmas present depends on how much he wins there... and I'm hoping for that Tiffany's bracelet.  So win big, hot stuff...

So on Goth Night, I worked and then I came home to shower and change.  The Bookworm wanted to hang out before Goth Night so he came and picked me up and we hung out before going to pick up Mr. Shorts.  It was weird going to the bar with the Bookworm... sort of different since I'm always waiting for him to show up... but nice.

So we go to the Dive and take our seats.  FunkyGoth shows up and he's giving death stares to the Bookworm.  Then a girl sits down next to FunkyGoth and it's obvious that he's talking about us.  And the girl starts making eyes at my date.  Jerk.  But of course, he was all about me... me, me, me.  So FunkyGoth's little plan to distract the Bookworm so he could have me all to himself didn't work.

So I shook my tailfeather, as per usual... the Frog showed up which threw the WineSnob for a loop... but he recovered nicely, as he usually does... Poker at his place, Sunday night, be there or be square...

That's pretty much all that happened at Goth Night... ScaryHat guy was there and he hit on a Goth girl and she completely shot him down... apparently it hurt his feelings... but that's what you get when you can't take a hint.  And we left early, which doesn't happen all that often... a rare Goth Night indeed.

So tonight I'm going to play designated driver for my friend Kayte and her drunk friends... I invited the Bookworm to come but I don't know if he will.. I hope he does, I'd like to see him...

He lives with his parents and has no job.  Yikes.  But he's a nice guy so I will keep him as a friend.  Much to the dismay of the Philosopher, I'm sure.

ScaryHat Guy was there last night.  I was ordering a kiddie cocktail in a martini glass for Mr. Shorts (a whole new level indeed) and the bartender says, ""that guy over there wants to buy this for you"".  I look over and I first think he's talking about FunkyGoth but he pointed out ScaryHat Guy.  This is the same stuff he pulled on me weeks ago... Scary.

I missed the Bookworm.  He's home for the holidays.  But he did text message me and he said that the only reason he came back to Goth Night after the first night was because of me... Too Cute.

I felt bad because he thought I stood him up last week.  But of course, I didn't.  He's just crazy.  Then the Bookworm called on Thursday when I was still deathly ill.  I asked him to kill me to put me out of my misery but he said he liked me too much to do that... isn't that cute?  We've been text-messaging each other all week and are supposed to meet for breakfast tomorrow.  Oh, and he offered to bring me chicken soup when I was sick... that was so sweet.  Mr. Shorts offered the same thing.  It's obvious who really loves me...

Anyhoo, I miss my former co-workers... but I don't miss Parkland at all... strange.  I think one of us should start a company and we should all work together in said company.  It doesn't much matter what it is, we'll have a blast...

P.S.  I almost forgot... the Doorman got fired... so I can go to Mike & Molly's without fear of seeing him... isn't that something?"

I cannot wait until noon... I am leaving Parkland... I think I might wet myself I'm so excited...

So since it's my last day, I should wax poetic about the things I will miss.  Here they are in list format:

1) I will miss my boss, the Grinch. (the other boss, the Dragon Lady, can kiss it)
2) I will miss pizza and Jimmy John's with Mr. Shorts.
3) I will miss surfing the web non-stop because there isn't crap to do.
4) I will miss Carrie-bear and our morning quotes.
5) I will miss seeing my Ju-Ju-Bee... my long lost sister.
6) I will miss making my own hours.

Um, yeah.  That's all... after almost 2 years of working here I can only think of 6 things and those are mostly from the past few months.  Sad.

And of course, tonight is goth night... Score.  FunkyGoth never called me... which I suppose is just as well since I'm not supposed to see him... long story.  Anyhoo, I might not be updating here as much since I'll actually have a job that keeps me busy... but I will try.  Because I love you all. *tear*

Since all of you know that I am poor, I desperately needed cash to last me until payday.  I had no food in my house and very little gas in my tank... sad.  But my rent is paid. *whew*

Then, Saturday evening at work someone asks me to work coat-check.  And coat-check girls get tips.  It couldn't have come at a better time.  So now I have money for gas and I got some food last night after work.  And I even have $2 for goth night.  I'm pleased as punch.

Tomorrow is my last day at Parkland!  I think I'll do cartwheels down the hallway... wait, I'm planning on wearing a skirt... scratch that idea.  Maybe I'll just celebrate by sleeping in on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday... yeah, that sounds about right.

"event","...which is rare for me.  I usually have to get up at 7 or so to go to work, even on the weekends.  But today I was scheduled in the afternoon so I got to sleep 'til 10:30.  Score.

I finally heard from Insight!  I start my new job on Monday, the 15.  That means that I will have Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday to sleep in.  I will be so bored, I can promise you that.  I've gotten pretty used to working all the time so when I don't work, I'm usually sleeping.  So now I don't know what I'll do... perhaps I'll rearrange my pantry... or clean out my fridge... or clean my apartment from top to bottom... or maybe I'll just eat fudge brownie sundaes and watch daytime TV... yeah, that's probably what I'll do.

Anyhoo, Mr. Shorts left me a message saying that he went out to lunch with the Temptress yesterday.  Score.  I need details in LiveJournal form please.

Yesterday I only worked at Parkland until 11am and then I went to do laundry.  I get home and check my messages and the Country Club called and wanted me to come in to do coat check.  I said no because I just wanted a night off and the last time I worked coat check I only got a few bucks tip.  Well, the girl who worked it, Cheeks, calls me at 10:30pm and tells me all about the tips she made... $100 in total... and now I'm kicking myself because I could have really used that money.

Ah life, what sweet crap it is...

Anyhoo, the weekend's here.  I still haven't heard from Insight and I'm supposed to start Wednesday.  I'm getting that guy's business card out and I'm calling him again.  I would like to know I'm unemployed before I'm unemployed...

Everyone cross your fingers for Prissy!

Nope, false alarm.  Norah Jones can do that to you.

So tonight is another Goth Night... I'm really looking forward to it.  I'm hoping the bookworm is there... You all know how I love to flirt with nerds... they're so sexy...

My use of ellipses may bother you... forgive me.  I've never been great at writing.  I attempted to write some poetry a few weeks ago... it was awful.  I have all these great words in my head but by the time my hand reaches the pen, it's all gone and it's been replaced by gibberish.  Unfortunate.

Anyhoo, someone has got to show me how to add pictures to this thing.  Carrie-Bear, I nominate you... we can even add the Tom the Turtle song if someone could figure it out... wait, me singing with a hood over my head... only slightly embarassing... scratch that.

Ah, Mr. Shorts has graced our department with his presence... he is still sick from Saturday but he's surviving... I don't think he's drinking tonight.  And of course, I'm not drinking because... well, I don't drink.  But I'm fun anyway...

OK, time to pretend to work... everyone be thinking of me tonight around 11pm CST... goth time.

*Edit* Carrie-bear has shown me how to put a picture on here... so now you can all see me... no insults, please."

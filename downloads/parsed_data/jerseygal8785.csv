"event","A week ago Matt asked me to go out on a Date and that he is wearing a suit on Friday Night!  He said he would pick me up at 6:30.  The date was in honor of our 11 Months being together.

Well Friday Night came and he picked me up looking very hansome in his pinstripe suit with 11 long stem roses. They are gorgeous!

We walk to the car and head towards Hartford, valet parking at Max Downtown (rated top restaurant in Hartford)!  It was great, we go in and they have our reservation.  They seat us at a window overlooking the city.  They serve us Wine and Appetizer on the house, we order Filet Mignon and we dine!  They clear the table and Matt & I sit and talk.  He says I'm babbling a lot tonight, which was true but then he goes into how much he loves me and how much I mean to him.  He says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me.  He stands up and walks over to me, gets down on one knee pops open the ring box and says: 

Will You Marry Me?

I hug him and kiss him and ofcourse say YES!  He puts the ring on my finger, which is gorgeous by the way!  The waiter brings champagne over and says congrats.  The couple next to us takes our first picture as an engaged couple!

Matt sits down and dessert is brought to us, on the house with chocolate spelling Congratulations!  A few minutes later the waiter comes over with a sparkling dessert wine compliments of John & Mark (Matt's bosses).  His bosses know the owner of the restaurant and they helped set up the perfect night, it was all planned and I had no idea!

The evening was amazing!  

On Saturday, Matt had another surpise for me.  We went to Olive Garden and walking in I hear a surprise and Congratulations for us.  He arranged a surpirse party of both his and my family.  Moms, Dads, Grandma, Sisters, Brothers!  It was truly amazing and felt so real, all of our family, 1 big family now!

It was truly a spectacular weekend and I cannot wait to spend my whole life with him!  It was the best surprise of my life!  We are so happy and so in love!  I am so happy I am going to marry my best friend of 4 years.

As for the RING!!!

It is an Elara.  Lux Bond & Green value at $12,500, Elara value at $14,000!  Solid Platinum Band with a 1.1 carat Diamond in a Cathedral Setting with 2 diamonds on the side of the setting.  It is a round cut in a square shape made to relect the most light!! It sure does sparkle, it is perfect just like Matt.

See our Pictures!"

This summer was great working and living with my love, now I feel I have back tracked!  Oh well, half done with this semester, and next will be extremely easy!! I hope :)

Other than that life is good, Matt is amazing and things are just flowing.  Trying not to think about whats wrong or bad things, just ignoring the bad and living happily.

Halloween tomorrow!! YAY!"

"event","Ever feel you are so far gone it doesn't matter anymore?  Going through the motions, keeping up with answers, fighting inside with nothing, not sure where you are headed or what you want.  Knowing you are doing the right thing, on the right path, loving every minute but have nothing in your mind.  You want to curl up cry, fight, laugh, smile, but it all takes to much energy.  Keeping secrets from yourself, not telling yourself who you are or what you want but telling yourself what others want and that is the way to life.  

There is a website where people tell their secrets and no-one knows them.  Take it to your grave!
http://www.postsecret.blogspot.com/

Things are great, actually they are fabulous, but I see nothing inside right now, school is swallowing me and I really just want to choke.  

Everyone is consumed with themselves, saying yes I understand, right, ok and oh shoot really? but who ever really listens to the other?"

Anyways my summer was awesome, sad that I am back almost.  The apartment was great, better than, it was fabulous!  (see pictures)  We celebrated both Matt & I's 21st!! (see pictures) Hell yeah! Deja Vu is the place to be.  We also discovered that we are a perfect match . .. maybe the diamond ring isnt to far off! lol  I did my usual, went ""down the shore"" introduced Matt to WildWood and the mile long hike! It was fun, lost some money at Atlantic City, went to some bars!! All very good things.  Came across the meaning of my life at this moment!  It's all good, It is what it is, I always resort too, but it is good, I meant the man of my dreams, have a good job and hello can we say SENIORITIS!!!

Back at school, living in Park River, other than parking sucking all seems to be good!!

Some questions are better left without a reason
And I would rather reveal myself than my situation
Now and then I consider, my hesitation
The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning, burning bright

I wonder if the things I did were just to be different
To spare myself of the constant shame of my existence
And I would surely redeem myself in my desperation
Here and now I'll express, my situation

There's nothing ever wrong but nothing's ever right
Such a cruel contradiction
I know I cross the lines its not easy to define
I'm born to indecision
There's always something new some path I'm supposed to choose
With no particular rhyme or reason"

Sometimes you wish you can take back everything, other times it's all good . . and you turn your head and walk away forgetting everything behind you and loving and approaching what's in front of you.

CHEERS to a new year! Let it be a good one -

People, work, homework, classes, teachers - I'm done - I want to go home . . 

So this teacher is totally men vs. women which if you know me drives me up the friggin wall . .well I never realized how bad he was until this year because I had him last year he just seemed funny with his jokes well this year there are only 6 people in the class so we all really get to know each other . . which is good because the class doesn't drag however this teacher ignores girls and their opinions he listen's then asks a guy and that's the end of the story . .or my fav he cuts you off to tell you his story . . well ok I'm self-centered too but atleast let me finish . . but anyways today was the last piece . . .lol . . he made fun of my major. .and he was on my turf Auerbach hall he is all hillyer . . .but anyways whatever - I'll make more money than he ever will . .wow I'm a brat . . 

but yeah anyways lets see what else is new besides I'm bored and half to go to a group thing tonight at 730 so I'm wasting time . . 

As always there is some confusion in my life right now with some people . . .not quite sure what to think or feel or do but I think that is why I want break - I am just sick of drama  . . .people getting on my nerves and annoyances and moping and feelings and rudeness and just DRAMA BLEH! . .love you all but still time for a break . . .maybe everything will make sense when I come back and it will just click one way or another . . ."

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Thursday Night was a very fun GUYS NIGHT! we ordered wings and drank beer - it was good, I got to hang out with my favorite UHA boys! 2 I haven't hung out with in awhile so it was lots of fun and definitly a lot of laughs. . . .however the end of the night was odd on so many levels - one friend had a rude awakening - (hugs and kisses it's all good) and we had to do some rescueing . . .and then I got to talk to another about life which was weird but fun . . .</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Friday - Not much happened - it was Ben's 21st and we went to dinner- expensive but delicious - drinks and some shots later we wound up back at my place and talked and chilled - favorite quote from that night ""You are the best girl driver I've ever been with"" YAY - thanks hun!!!

<P><FONT color=#009900>Saturday I woke up at 630 am to drive home and be at my sisters by 1230 - there was no traffic so it was great however I was exhausted.&nbsp; I got to play with Billy all day - I miss him so much, and I hung out with my sister cooking and baking and we caught up on everything - that was fun - We celebrated Dad's birthday which was suprisingly relaxful night! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Lately, I have been getting a lot of attention from different people so I've been pretty happy, I'm a Leo I live for attention - however recently I'm begginning to realize it is negative attention - granted I brought it on myself but still what have I done that makes me so unlovable and just such a bitch!&nbsp; I don't want to be that girl but hey I am who I am and it usually doesn't bother me but somehow I just don't feel like who I am is a good person.&nbsp; I liked to be loved for good reasons and not that I'm asking for it because I want it to be true and real but I wish some people would figure out there real emotion towards me, because I'm pretty aggravated by it!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>But anyways I don't&nbsp;mean this to be really that self conceited that I'm complaining I'm not loved because I am I just want to be loved by others as well.</FONT></P>

You realize there is nothing you can do, your choices are half chance, just like everyone else.  Life can be fabulous or it can be horrible, point is, it is what you make it! So make it with a smile!

whether real or not - it is easier to laugh with a smile and say who cares!"

"event","Sometimes you need to look right in front of you and realize what makes you happy are the people listening . . .whether they are laughing because you lit the toaster on fire, or screaming because there is a mouse, or drunk and playing with kermit, or ok amanda have another jello shot or going on late night ice cream runs even though they have work early the next morning or they just hug you because you cant stop crying - they are truly the happy moments of your life!  So you need to smile and say I'm still here and that is what matters and whatever to all the rest!"

"event","I always tell people that they need to make themselves happy before seeing happiness with someone else.

Why is it so hard to listen to your own advice? especially when you know you are right!  After having Matt and Caitlin debate my life for me and trying to understand what they are telling me - I'm even more confused.  I'm tired of mixed feelings and emotions, I'm tired of being happy and mad and sad all at the same time, I'm tired of wondering and I'm tired of thinking and I'm especially tired of talking about it, however it's hard not too! But what can I do to change it and if I do change it I don't want to wonder if I chose wrong.

What makes you happy?"

"event","So yeah - on Thursday I learned my lesson the VERY hard way!  Do NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES mix meds and alcohol! it's so bad! lol  But yeah other than that - I need to listen to Matt and Shalane more often - sorry kids! 

And yes - I know I was a bitch too - which that definitly needs to stop! lol

But anyways - this week has opened my eyes to many things - you can't stress over the little things because if something big comes along you just burst - you need to chill, I need to take my own advice, ""It is what it is"" granted that is a lot harder than it is but it is the truth!  I have some really great friends here - that are there which I love them for - I may not still be here if it wasnt for them, in all senses . . 

On a good note - I'm chilled, I had the rude awakening which I think was God's way of saying Amanda - you're not doing well and you are to stubborn to see that.

So hey - it is what it is! and right now - the little things are not going to get to me - there is to much to worry about - school is the most important right now - social aspects should just be fun, no drama and especially no strings attached!"

"event","She walks to school with a lunch she packed 
Nobody knows what she's holding back; 
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday, 
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace; 
oh 

The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask, 
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask; 
Bearing the burdon of a secret storm, 
Sometimes she wishes she was never born; 

Through the wind and the rain, 
She stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above; 
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved. 

Concrete Angel 

Somebody cries in the middle of the night, 
The neighbors hear but they turn out the lights; 
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate, 
When morning comes it will be too late. 

Through the wind and the rain, 
She stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above; 
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved. 

Concrete Angel 

A statue stands in a shaded place, 
An angel girl with an upturned face; 
Her name is written on a polished rock, 
A broken heart that the world forgot. 

Through the wind and the rain, 
She stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above; 
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved. 

Concrete Angel"

"event","First Let's talk about the weekend - 

Thursday - was once again a very thirsty thursday - nothing really happened except drinks and talking! 

Friday - Hung over at Work, and class and then running around with Caitlin - followed by family dinner at Ben's! interesting night! Many round of drinks! lol well at least for me - Walked around the village and then Shalane and I were interested in these 2 guys - Brian and Ryan - yeah wierd! i know but anyways I pulled her by the hand and told her to put her ""flirt on"" - it worked! lol I got Brian - needless to say I walked the ""walk of shame"" at 6:30 AM to my aparment - but damn - talk about experienced!!!! Awesome times - one nighters are the way to be lol!! and Shalane - well she was happy the next day too - she had fun with  6'7"" Ryan! - but that's her story! lol

Saturday - recovered from a very bad hang over - Ordered WINGS - yum and went to the movies with Matt Ben Shalane saw Just Like Heaven - good movie but it made us all think about our love lives :(

Sunday - Went home for the day with Matt - TAYLOR HAM AND CHEESE all the way! yum!!! Got my new printer!! yay!! and then came back - one of my best times back here just under 2 hours! I think matt was holding on at some points lol!

Now for the WONDERING part of this title! -

Things have been moving very fast lately with randomn expectations and I'm just not sure what I want - I wish someone would tell me and I would believe them that - that is the right course - but all my friends give me their opinions and I'm just not sure - who knows about any of it! I guess it is what it is and I just need to live and enjoy the ride - but its hard when you are so completely happy and at the same time you just want to break into tears.

P.S. Krill is home for 16 days from Iraq and I'm so exicted!"

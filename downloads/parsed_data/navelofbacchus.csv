"event","It is a particular and discouraging habit of the Maywood Hall staircase to prefer alcohol almost exclusively over any other beverage.  I say this not because I disapprove of driving alcohol (I myself have been known to share jello shots with my legally mature friends), nor do I say this because I think it is wrong for staircases to consume food and drink.  I am bothered most by the manner in which the staircase presents itself late of a sunday night.

There are plenty of responsible drunks, taking their rum in selver flasks, clean shaven, neatly dressed, with only a slight gleam in their eye and a minor slurring of speech and general wobbliness to their motions giving evidence to thoir intoxicated interiors.  But this staircase -- and I'm speaking in particular of the one residing close by the main entrance to Maywood Hall -- this staircase is *not* such a drunk.  This staircase is somewhat of the sloppy sort, spilling its beer all over its steps, collecting fries and other remnants of disorderly trips to nearby Wendy's.  This staircase takes no pride in its appearance and even on weekdays is generally known to associate with the sort of people fathers try their hardest to keep their daughters from.

Let it be known that I do not dislike this staircase.  and while my visits may not be of the most prolonged sort, I do enjoy the company of this staircase (admittedly more so on its better days).  I don't believe the staircase is all bad.  It is just that it behaves a bit immature for its age and perhaps should consider seeking out new friends, ones who won't promote such disorderly and licentious behaviour.

When a staircase falls in with the wrong crowd, it is bound to make a few mistakes.  It is my opinion, however, that the overall comportment of this particular staircase suggests a deeper malaise.  Surely this staircase feels a certain dissatifaction with its life, and I do know that it has a hard time sleeping at night.  Indeed, it doesn't get out much at all.  It would not be surprising should this staircase fall into poor health.

It is our responsibility, as friends and companions of this staircase, to help it out in any way that we can.  Can we allow any member of our community to suffer such indignities as this staircase allows itself to perform upon its very own person?  Indeed we cannot.  It is up to each and every one of us to be friendly and kind toward our neighborhood staircase.  We must be careful not to jostle its arm at parties.  We must encourage it to give up littering and its other small vices.  We must teach it to wash itself daily, and exfoliate.

We can fill the staircase with renewed self confidence.  We can help it to wake up every morning clean and refreshed from a good night's sleep.  We can show it that daily hangovers do not need to be sufferend and that there is a better, more respectable life available for it if it would just spend a little more time considering how its appearance affects the people around it."

"event","Zach and I were sitting around yesterday, as we do sometimes, watching the Red Sox and contemplating orgies.  We found ourselves trying to determine what actually constitutes and orgy.  What basic rules have to be satisfied in order for an orgy to be happening?  We came up with the following postulates.

Four Postulates Constituting an Orgy
1. Minimum 4 people
2. A pairing of maximum 2 people on 1 other person according to the participants' sexual preferences must be possible.
3. If you avoid pleasuring or being pleasured by more than one person during the course of the orgy, you are not part of the orgy.
4. Any participant can be linked to any other by a chain of interaction, where each link in the chain is a person giving pleasure to or receiving pleasure from another, at some time.

Drafted by Zach Pardos and Greg Hollands with Contributions by Jesse, Mike,  Tim, and Corinne.

We think that these 4 rules are sufficient to define an orgy and differentiate between an orgy and other types of sexual activity.  I shall proceed now to explain each of the rules more in depth.

--Rule #1, Minimum 4 people--

a. One person masturbating does not constitute and orgy, ever.
b. Two people having sex or masturbating together or participating in some other sexual activity are not having an orgy.
c. Three people, whether it be one guy and two girls, or one girl and two guys, are having a three-some, not an orgy.  You may note that rule number two describes a ratio whereby an orgy may consist of a number of three-somes, however after much deliberation we have determined that one three-some in itself does not constitute an orgy.
d. Four people are the minimum number possible to create an orgy, but four people do not constitute an orgy in all situations.  One guy pleasuring 3 girls, supposing that the girls themselves are not pleasuring each other but are only pleasuring the guy, is not an orgy.  One girl and 3 guys is a gang bang not an orgy, unless some of the guys are bi and are interacting with each other in that way.  It is crucial that an orgy satisfy Rule #2, because that rule sets a certain ratio of possible interaction.  Without that interaction an orgy is not possible.  Four people can make an orgy in situations where there is a chain of interaction longer than 1 link between any two people.  A guy and 3 girls does constitute an orgy if at some point two of the girls are going at each other.    A situation where a girl is giving head and being fucked by two guys is not an orgy unless one of the guys is also interacting with another person, perhaps he himself is being fucked while he is fucking.  Two couples having sex next to each other do not constitute an orgy unless the couples interact sexually at some point, perhaps the girls would make out, hopefully going farther.

I'd like to point out here that our definition of an orgy does not specify which sexual acts are acceptable and which aren't.  It may be possible to envision an orgy according to our definition wherein no penetration is involved, only oral sex and kissing.  However, it is impossible for an orgy to be composed of only kissing if it is to comply with Rule #2.  A person cannot kiss two people at the same time.

e. It is easy to imagine how five people can constitute an orgy, and it has been suggested to us that 5 is the minimum number of people for an orgy.  Arguments have been raised that two couples switching partners are only swinging, and are not in fact having an orgy.  I disagree.  If the couples switch partners and then go and have 1-on-1 sex together, that is definitely swinging and not an orgy.  However, if the couples have sex next to each other and then switch partners without ceasing to have sex, it surely must be an orgy.  I think the important point to note here is that a number of people performing sexual acts upon one another each at a separate time, though perhaps in quick succession, does not constitute an orgy.  This is where Rule #3 comes into play.  If there are enough people that some are sitting out, then those people are required to go at each other if they are participating in the orgy.  To be there and not be willing to participate given the opportunity is to be leaving the orgy, if only temporarily.


--Rule #2, A pairing of maximum 2 people on 1 other person according to the participants' sexual preferences must be possible.--

This rule was originally conceived to avoid using a direct ratio of guys and girls.  It has expanded from the proposed 2/5 girls to 3/5 guys as a minimum of the number of girls required to avoid the gang bang scenario.  The idea is that people must be willing to interact with each other.  If you have 3 straight guys, 1 straight girl, and two lesbians, then you achieve the ratio but do not comply to our rule.  The lesbians would not interact with the straight guys and would not be part of the orgy.  The 3 straight guys would never interact with each other and a gang bang would ensue.  No matter what sexual preferences people have, it must be possible to pair them all up so that 2 people on 1 other person is the maximum.  While 3 on 1 or greater ratios are not disallowed in an orgy, in those situations the people participating would naturally be going at each other while they are going at that one favored individual.

In the case of a very large orgy, with perhaps over 30 people participating, it may not be easy to look at the group and apply this rule.  Surely the majority of the orgy would comply with this rule if it is to avoid becoming a series of gang bangs next to each other.  It is possible that a gang bang could exist within an orgy, however if this ratio is satisfied then for a solitary gang bang to occur then some one person, who could be pleasuring or being pleasured by one of the many that is going at that one, would either have to sit out for a bit, join in the gang bang in such a way that it becomes an orgy, or join another group and thus raising that group over the 2-on-1 cap.  It absolutely must be possible for everyone to be paired up in 2-on-1 maximum groupings at some point during the course of the orgy.  This does not preclude a chain of people interacting where a number of people are interacting with 2 others all together and intertwined in one large group.


--Rule #3, If you avoid pleasuring or being pleasured by more than one person, during the orgy, you are not part of the orgy.--

Originally we had a rule giving the maximum number of solitary masturbators at any given point, however we found that rule to be insufficient in the case of large orgies where solitary masturbators may not notice each other and not realize that they had opportunity to pleasure each other.  We created this rule to cover that situation.  It gets at the attitude the participants must have.  Everyone must be willing to have sex with anyone else that fits their preferences.  In the example of a guy going to an orgy with his girlfriend, if he has sex with only her while she participates with others, then it is unlikely that he is part of the orgy.  However, it may be the case that he never has the opportunity to pleasure or be pleasured by anyone else.  Perhaps they showed up late, or maybe there's an inordinate number of gay guys and lesbians.  Whatever the case, as long as he's willing and ready and isn't avoiding participation, then he can be considered part of the orgy, though he may not have participated as much as others have.


--Rule #4, Any participant can be linked to any other by a chain of interaction, where each link in the chain is a person giving pleasure to or receiving pleasure from another, at some time.--

Here, we were trying to avoid the possibility of multiple people having sex next to each other, or having multiple three-somes in close vicinity.  While this may occur at an orgy, the crucial difference is that at the orgy the participants of one group will switch up and participate with another group.  Because they switch partners, the interactions become more complex and various.  Indeed, there may even be a main orgy with a three-some next to it, although that three-some would not be part of the orgy unless some of the members participate in the main orgy.  Since one of the qualities of an orgy is that people switch partners, participants in an orgy should be able to be linked to each other by following the interactions between people as one would follow links on a chain.  You could list all the participants' names and draw lines between the people who have interacted with each other.  Picking any two people on that list, you must be able to follow the lines of interaction from the one to the other.

If two couples are having sex and then the girls start making out or pleasuring each other in some other way, then the guys are linked together via the girls though the guys may not have directly interacted with each other at all.  In this way, each two-some or three-some during the course of the orgy would be linked to the rest of the orgy by some or all of the members going and participating in other groupings within the orgy.


--
I think these 4 rules are sufficient to describe an orgy, however it is still possible that they may need refinement.  If you can think of an example which counters these rules, I encourage you to comment on it so that these rules may be improved."

note: this message has been modified for easier reading


sdnalloh (12:30:21 AM): and i was hanging out with a girl in a really fucking short skirt all day and now i'm horny as all hell, thus my cunt comment.

HonestIago6 is idle at 12:37:28 AM.

Auto response from HonestIago6 (12:37:33 AM): I'd rather be in Chyna 

sdnalloh (12:37:41 AM): How can you leave me at a moment like this?  Now i'm gonna cry about how my friend mike doesn't love me, and i'll sob and sob, and then we'll have passionate hate-sex in the bathroom while i'm vomiting in the toilette.  I'll cook the solid chunks into the omlettes at breakfast the next morning, every bite full of runny half-digested lasagne.  Like christ on the cross, you will be crucified to your seat, spikes through your feet into the floor, your hands held similarly on each side of the plate.  Eat your food like an animal.  You won't be able to get up until you're done, but don't worry, you'll come back to life in a blissful reawakening as a highly evolved and violent man who's very fond of hammers and what they can do to the skulls of people who piss you off.

btw, i hope you don't mind that i'm getting out my aggression."

"event","i was playing monopoly with greg and asa in their tiny living room.  The room itself is a trap for spare energy.  Like a whirlpool it sucks you in and spins you around.  You get tangled in the threads of the couch.  your feet become trapped by the pressure between the table and the couches.  Unable to move, i floundered there amongst the empty cups, the ashtrays and the monopoly money.

Zach came and disturbed the room's delicate web.  He spilled the monopoly money and sapped our attention.  He wanted to go to the bar, but trapped as i was i could not extract myself from the room.  pleading loyalty to the board game i had caused, i explained that i could not leave until the game was done.  But Zach would not sit there and be caught in the room's nasty web.  He sat quietly and was gone.

In a three-way deal each of us had gained a monopoly, and by now we each had two.  Asa and Greg each had one of those dual-property monopolies around start, greg owning the more expensive of the two, and the game was locked tight in that final struggle either to build fast or be crushed. Soon enough i landed on Park Place, and not long after Asa too fell to Greg's corporate might.  

But we were still trapped in that godforsaken room.  A giant television commanded a focal point in the room.  The stereo's scratched cds kept skipping as muted music spilled densely into the air from behind cloth curtains.  I could do nothing but fidget, having now exhausted the mental stimulation of the room.  My thoughts were being slowly drained from me and i nodded my head as a slow stupor washed over me.  

Could it be that this is what it feels like for a fly as it lies trapped in the spider's web?  The room pulls you in, but it won't let you out.  What a well-designed web it is.    As my active mind slowly fades and is replaced by a complacent, accepting nothingness, i cannot help but think that this is exacty what the fly feels as the spider's poison seeps through its body.  Soon i will be numb and comatose, unable even to comprehend how my body is slowly becoming a spider's human milkshake.

Brandy came, her penciled eyelashes mocking me.  She moved her mouth, but i could not comprehend her words.  Save me, i pleaded with my eyes, i do not want to be devoured by this room.  She grabbed my wrist and pulled me up, out of the room.  Grateful, i provided only verbal protest, glad to be free at last from that horrible trap.  She dragged my by the arm out into the street.  There was zach, using his silence like a powerful magnet, but to me it could do nothing.  i had no outgoing talkativeness that his aura of receptiveness could catch ahold of.  Now that i was free of the room, i needed only to jumpstart my body.  I was like a morose mannequin, unable to interact socially, hardly able even to sustain a linear thought pattern.  I needed a conversation to catch my wandering mind.  I needed to listen and by listening be reminded of what it is to interact in this society i'd been pulled roughly out into.

From living room to car to barstool, i had been transplanted, the same plant in a new environment.  I saw the girls next to me at the back of the bar.  I knew what to do start a conversation, to maneuver onto the dance floor, to make her pretty face glow and her body to adjust itself to the binary cadence of the music, but i could not bring myself to break free of the cocoon that had enveloped me.  I could not push myself out beyond myself.  I could not free myself from the bonds that had seeped into my skin.  I could hardly even follow my physical movements as my mind struggled to acclimate itself to the loud, vibrant atmosphere of this Main Street dance hall.  I sipped my drink through the straw that had been given me and i looked about, through eyes that were not sure how to display themselves.

The girls had wandered off, and I was lost in my introverted world, sipping my drink as fast as i could, hoping the alcohol would give me that push i needed into the extroverted world.  I turned to my left, and zach was gone.  He'd wandered off onto the dance floor.  Brandy had begun talking to some guy.  I was stranded a barstool away from she who had uprooted me.  I was that sad man at the back of the bar drinking himself into oblivion.  I'd spilled on my shirt, my hair was messy, and i was wearing workboots on my feet.  I was not prepared for this situation in the least, and it showed remarkably.  

Brandy turned and saw me.  She motioned for me to sit on the seat next to her.  This is Tim, she said, and Tim proceeded to admonish her for leaving me all alone.  Soon enough, however, they were back into their private conversation and Zach had maneuvered me onto the dance floor.  Standing up, i began to bob my head, to bend my knees, to move my feet.  As my movements became more complex, so too did my thoughts become clearer.  I saw people moving around eachother, through eachother, sitting in corners talking, standing together in clumps.  But Zach continued to push his silent come-hither attitude. He would give to no one and would take from all.

I shared a dance with Brandy and then she turned to Tim.  It was time for me to leave.  Neither the alcohol nor the dancing could break my free of the bonds that had entangled me.  And so i began to walk.  With the cadence of my footsteps, my mind began to follow itself steadily through time.  A linear thought pattern appeared.  Confidently i walked on, watching the cars go by on the street.  The cops passed me and then turned around and passed me again.  i turned up a small side street and began going uphill, back toward that cagey house and near it my car.  A street sweeper was coming down the street toward me and i watched it as it passed.  

I sat down in the light by the side of the curb and contemplated the world.  my thoughts ranged from dentistry to optometry before the street sweeper came back up to my corner.  I waved as it headed off.  I'd found myself again.  I'd broken free of the bonds that had covered me.  I opened the windows and listened to the quiet night sounds as i drove slowly home down tree-lined streets."

in case you dont' know what it is:
basically, i go up to my family's place in maine with some of my friends for a week.  All my friend are invited, and everyone is encouraged to bring others.  Use it as an excuse for a road trip if you want.  Of course, no one is obliged to stay the entire time, and some people choose to show up only for the last weekend.  My family's place is deep in the woods northwest of Augusta, in the little town of Rome in the Belgrade Lakes region.  The town boasts a general store, an auction house, and a volunteer fire department as well as numerous farm (note well the lack of a police force).  We stay in a spacious little house on the side of Little North Pond and spend our time hiking, boating, swimming, sailing, and doing various other outdoorsy summer things.  It's a great time.  This will be the Third Annual Navel of Bacchus Celebration.  Last year's experience was dubbed the Cranfasticon, and this year we will continue to carry on that title.

I hope to see everyone there.  If you can't make it (and even if you can) please respond and tell me what you think."

"event","Rising from the exertions of procrastinated late night work, one's stomach grumbles its impatience.  Amidst these lugubrations a respite is sorely needed, both for the mind and for the body.  Extended near inactivity requires a bit of stretching, and so one wanders through the building in search for a momentary diversion.  At the vending machine one finds the sought-after conversation, and amidst a slow stream of people coming and going a singular conversation begins.  A dialogue between two people is created, despite the steady replacement of the other side.  The sound of voices in frivolous conversation clears the mind and brightens the spirit, allowing one to return again to the drudgery of scholastic efforts."

Can there be any denying the rejuvinative effects of this leisure time?  It is soothing to lie cozy in bed, tied together in the tangles of sheets.

After a slow waking period consisting of hours of lazy movement, wakefulness returns again to the mind.  Rested and charged, a slow, organized energy builds.  There is a surprising amount of focus.  The mind encompasses a vast tract of time in it's thinking.

When an outside force enters this steady realm, it gets caught up in the slow diversity of action.  There can be no quick leaving, no sudden movement.  A myriad of small movements culminate in a greater and more profound final action."

However, a store run by businessmen who set the prices without spending time helping in the day-to-day operations of the business will be more likely to cheat its customers.  These owners are more concerned with turning a profit than with providing a service.  They can buy in bulk at the lowest price and stock all their various stores with at prices slightly higher than the local store.  Even if they undercut the locals, their profits will be greater."

"event","Sitting in AS233 late this afternoon I noticed, in my calm post-meditative state, that my handwriting had become -- as it does on occasion -- absurdly neat and somewhat curly.  A pepperminty smell wafted past my nose, and i wrote, amidst my notes, a line of text.

<blockquote><em>the smell of peppermint overcomes that sweet horizontal scent lingering in the air.</em></blockquote>

musingly, i wrote out the word <em>twelve</em> in an empty space apart from the other text, and i embellished it with the profile of a face & a squiggle 'n' above it.  I've recently noticed the absurd strangeness of the word twelve: consonant, consonant, vowel, consonant, consonant, vowel; yet somehow it only has 1 syllable.

Not long after, I wrote the following poem on a new page.

<blockquote>Wisdom Two

The comforting glide of pen over paper
such subtle resistance
downward pressure upon paper
note each letter
note each word
forget that you are writing
the curly patterns
moving formative across the page
and aesthetic combination
of meaning and form</blockquote>

Musing again upon the curious nature of the word <em>twelve</em>, i wrote a few more lines down in my notebook.

<blockquote><em>the voiceless expulsion of breath after the word
just barely creates the suggestion of a second syllable
who can deny the need for a continuing voice?</em></blockquote>

Nearing the end of class Maya raised her hand, and as the teacher didn't notice her silent appeal for attention, she kept it raised.  By and by the subject matter moved off of the relative topic and slowly she lowered her hand again.  In response to this i was compelled to write yet another poem (although not nearly as horrid as the last one).

<blockquote>waiting,
hand raised,
for notice that does not come.

the topic changes,
and with disappointment
you lower your hand,
looking around at the faces of others.</blockquote>"

Does the wind actually move -- as you and i move across a room -- or is it really just a passing excitation moving through the air, like rumor or a good joke, which spreads throughout the party before its physical hosts ever have the chance to achieve such dramatic mobility?

A leaf blown noisily across an empty parking lot is like a crowd surfer riding the upraised hands of fans at a show.  Its motion is achieved only through the passing aid of stationary stimuli, collectively focusing each tiny force upon a singular goal.

A sudden mighty gust forces a tree to violently shudder as the noise reaches a deafening peak.  I stumble up the last step as this powerful force abruptly pushes at me, taking a moment to marvel at the immaterial power in the air before heading in to grab another load for the car."

In order to bring myself to successfully accomplish any monotonously time-consuming task, i must find a way to force myself to focus.  I must use my wit to fool my mind so that i may overcome even my own shortcomings.

The Tao Te Ching states numerous times that, in trying to accomplish one thing, one must accomplish its opposite.  Thus, in order to focus i must remain irresponsibly unfocused.  And when, after weeks of falling behind, i suddenly find myself faced with a choice between two polar opposites, i always choose the extreme opposite the one i am at.  Change is a continuous certainty in life; the wheel rotates ever onward.

Like a phoenix, i must destroy myself in order to create myself.  This pattern has repeated itself throughout my life.  First i gave away my soul so that i would be free of the burden of conscience, but now i have formed a pragmatic ethic that fills the void i'd created.  Years later, i destroyed all my writings so that the knowledge i'd compiled would not hinder my discovery of new forms of learning, but now i have once again begun taking notes on life.  When i thought that i was leaving home for good, i threw out all the things that i saw as unnecessary, yet since then i have returned to my parents and have begun once again to amass 'stuff'.

When i could no longer bear the path that my life was leading me down, i followed it to its end and threw myself off the cliff that i found there.  I fell for months, until at long last i was forced to reach out for the knotted rope that dangled at my side.  The climb was arduous: the rope cut my hands until they bled; tears filled my eyes until i was blinded by them; fatigue clutched at my legs and grappled with my arms until i could hardly move at all.  But at long last i reached a peak, higher than the cliff from which i had jumped, and looked out over a magnificent vista.

I wanted to fall in love, and so threw my entire heart into the task that i soon could not see beyond my nose, but here i am now doing it again."

After gorging myself and thinking bulimic thoughts, i was finally able to compose myself enough that i only wove slightly back and forth on the walk to the caf.  Some music, some shallowness, and abundant alcohol topped off an evening of artful conversation in the warm february night.

Was it the caffeine that caused my shaking?  Was it the relaxation of a slightly slower world that instigated such excellent conversation?  Perhaps it was the music and the singularly wonderful company that instilled in me an intense desire for nocturnal wanderings.  As always, once i began moving, everything began to fall into place.  This was the state of mind i fell asleep with.

To begin a new day, after such an unusually exquisite predecessor, in which one's first experience is of one's lover leaning over you whispering 'wake up' in the pale early morning light, is a truly wonderful thing.  The entire day's beauty soon became enticingly evident.  Over a midday meal, speaking, as i seldom do, in simultaneous contentment, honesty, and imagination, i became strongly reminiscent.  Where are the lucky artists with whom i long to associate?  Alas, my Red House friends are somewhere else.  And so i clutch ever more tightly to the happiness at hand.

After an entire day of deep inner warmth, as i sat down at long last to study chinese, i began to cry.  In that very moment i understood everything, yet i could not focus in that steady manner requisite for memorizing, and chose instead to succumb once again to that horrible weakness of inaction and sleep."

"event","It is with a dispasionate, self-reflective, and somber mood that I sit down with these thoughts bubbling to the surface of my mind.  I have spent so many years studying the patterns and movements of my world that this current state seems wholly unnatural.  With increasing sobriety, my mind has become ever more and more accustomed to the world around it.  In what I see as an undesireable movement, I have begun to watch my life go by in a continuous stream rather than as ambiguous moments entirely separate from eachother.

This hideous linear view has, from time to time, plagued me before.  At various points in my life I have looked up from my lugubrations, over the stacks of scribbled notes, typed observations, and hand-bound journals.  Time would begin to move at a steady pace.  Two people walking at the same speed would appear to be the same distance from their respective starting points.  Hours would pass with mechanistic regularity, and on fitful restless nights I would dream dreams in which I was me and the world abided by the laws of neutonian physics.  So it is with me now.

After a night of pink dreams, in which people would blandly open the door when seeking entrance into the square white room of my nocturnal chamber, I awoke to a day of such diverse regularity that even I did not notice its cartesian planar aspect, that is until I came to encounter another, my mother, in whom an even more absurdly linear world-view has long been holding court.  With a creeping horror, I have come to realize the danger I am in.

I had long been enjoying the luxury of a life in which every moment is distinctly separate from the ones previous and following.  I would find myself, many times a day, in a place or situation that I did not recall getting into.  I was adept at making intuitive judgements and acting on instinct.  I would study people and colors, the shapes of the shadows in a room, the distance between a person viewed with the left eye and that same person viewed with the right eye.  Basing my world on patterns of sound and color, every day was a new adventure, nothing was predictable.

Alas, my only hope is that this despicable linearity will pass.  I cannot survive this monotony of perspective for too long.  I can live as one person, but I cannot live in one world."

A moment ago I sat in the kitchen, eating mildly-flavored pasta from a wok.  I should have added another tomato, but the intense subtlety of the flavoring reminded me of the japanese culinary preference.  Mind you, I was not eating seafood or even a dish that was particularly japanese.  There was only this one aspect upon which my mind focused.

As I was eating, a girl from down the hall walked in and began washing dishes behind my back.  Eating quietly, I watched her reflection in the window.  I could see her clearly, but through her evanescent form I could see the snowy landscape beyond.  Scenes from japanese books popped into my mind, and i could see myself at that moment as the young man in Norwegian Wood who, visiting that apartment for the first time, tastes with delight that home-cooked meal.

She turns off the water, and I break out of my reverie.  I am not japanese; I am american.  I should appreciate directness, frankness, loudness, rudeness, independence, ignorance.  Oh wait, perhaps these too are stereotypes.

It does not pounce like a cat, its tail twitching in anticipation.  It does not hunt in the communal fashion of the wolf or the lion.  Truly a spider it is; like a rat it feeds off the effort of others.  Its legs are strong and well proportioned, its face an effective disguise for the venom hidden within.  

Patiently it waits until its prey has entangled itself within a sticky web of shimmering horror.  With its prey well-tangled and unable to extract itself, this spider-like monstrosity moves close to its unsuspecting victim.  It keeps its enemies close in the tight grasp of a lover, speaking soft and cajoling words to calm a beating heart.  Slowly it extracts the life from its victim, feeding its depraved mind with the emotional stability of an honest soul.

At long last, the victimized creature realizes its the cruel trap that fate has led him to.  An escape must be made, but struggling frees him not.  Only when the beast has had its fill does it release its death grip.  Panicky fear has given its meal a foul taste.  Ripping itself free of its bonds, the hapless prey has barely enough strength to crawl slowly away.

Recuperated at long last, he rests seated upon a small hill, munching an apple.  In the distance lies that beautifully shimmering web.  He marvels at the cunning of the trap, at the singular cruelty harbored within the twisted mind of that crazy selfish creature.  Mesmerized by the beautiful genius of it all, he shakes his head and lies back on the grass, daydreaming about the totem to its own success the creature must surely be making."

Finally, 48 hours after my return to a predominantly english country, I am again able to quickly and precisely choose my expressive words with care.  Once again I can think about how the diction and structure of my language affects others.  I can use words not because they are sufficient, but because they portray a certain auditory style.

First, there is my address book, a curious little object.  At first glance, it appears to contain a respectable amount of phone numbers, but upon close inspection this is proven to be an exaggeration.  Many of the numbers reference outdated or soon-to-be-outdated college room phone numbers.  Other entries are for people i met only once, like Kelly Brown, whom I have never called.  There is a mysterious entry for a 'John', whose face I can't recall.  The entry for Lauren Lean is the most peculiar.  No phone number is given, instead is written '24 Kensington Park Gardens, London W11 2qu, England.'  I think she resides in Jersey.

The next item is a check, folded in half.  It is a christmas gift from my grandfather.  It's fifty dollars that I know I won't spend until the day I go to the bank.

Half of a blue carnival-style ticket bears the number 328965.  This is the last physical indication that I went to a film with Mark.  It was a documentary about the making of a movie, which failed.  I highly recommend it

An assortment of euro coins comes to a total of 6E57.

Last, we come to a 10cm square piece of paper.  On the one side, in red ink, is the printed photo of two young girls screaming.  The other side reveals a museum ticket stub.  Dated last friday, and displaying words that are cut off, I can't recall which museum it is from.  In the space between two lines is written in my own hand a large number: 0607175012.  It is the number of a girl who called on Laurent while he was out.  Why I didn't invite her up for a pot of tea is beyond me, but I had Laurent's guitar to play and her hysterical french was too much for me to fully comprehend.  Alas, without a name I cannot enter it into my addressbook."

I tap my fingers to the beat as I stare out the window at passing sights.  Giovanni is speaking in French with Mark, I am wedged between the window and Cinzia; it's a tight squeeze in the back of the cab for the four of us.  The grey buildings, the grey sky, the dirty grey street beneath us: with the jazz it's depressing aura is made normal.

As we stop at a crowded street corner, I look into the car next to us.  Two girls in the back, two boys in the front, they open the window and turn up the music as the car shifts into gear and zips down the street away from us.  And the jazz gives this whole scene an 'it's happened before' mood.  With this slow music playing, the world slows down.  People are people and in the moment they seem to move quickly, but the saxaphone pulls me back a step.  I look out at a larger picture.  This city is an organism which lives and breathes at a much slower pace than any of us can think.  Breathe out and there's a revolution, breathe in and the world is at peace.  In a simple span of breaths, the city hardly changes.  It takes centuries to effect any lasting difference.

Giovanni and Cinzia get out, Mark and I are alone in the cab.  Silent, unbuckled, the roads pass by.  So alike, so many of them.  Centuries could pass, riding in this cab without stop, and we would observe no noticeable change in the outside world.  Clothing and cars might alter, but the city would remain the same, the people would do nothing different, generations of ants living in the ancestral ant-hill.

In this moment you realize that the man across the table from you, the man with two rats in his hood, this man instigated the conversation last time.  His english is halting, but he none-the-less attempted a meaningful and interesting conversation.

A moment ago, when the lull in the conversation was such that the others were speaking to eachother, you both knew that it was time for a continuation of your conversation.  You looked at him over a sip of beer, and for a second he returned the gaze.  and so you nodded and he nodded back, a silent affirmation that the conversation was not to happen.

Just now, with another beer in your belly, you have been going over the words that will create anew a conversation with this man, this man with whom you've been placed, for whatever reason.  But, in looking at him stare off into space, you  cannot bring yourself to make a move.  'You are too shy,' you tell yourself, 'to break such an awkward silence.'  And so it continues.

He continues his diagonal conversation with the girl to your right, a girl who does indeed speak english, a girl who is also somewhat attractive, and a musician as well.  But you had been shy with this girl too, responding only when you had been spoken to, not bringing up any new conversation, in fact letting the weight of conversational responsibility lie on her shoulders.  and with this man, whose name you could not even remember, you are doing the same.

But what is this?  He has broken the cycle.  He has taken your turn as his.  If only you had known how to pass your turn on, this self-conscious waiting would not have occurred.  But now he is leaning forward, his rats peering out from within his hood, and he is speaking in halting english.  And so you respond, but at first you allow him to continue to hold the bulk of the conversation.

Eventually, when you realize that you have finished your beer, you have the courage to strike up again that conversation with the girl to your right.  But look, she has gotten up from  the table and is making as if to  go.  Others too have started  to rise and don their coats.  The bill is being paid, every centine accounted for.  You are too  late, your moment is gone.

Amidst the confusion, you watch the argument over the last of the bill.  Outside, with your coat on, you realize again what a fool you have been, but you put it off once more to your weakness.  Bisoux, bisoux.  You kiss some cheeks, you shake some hands.  A man who had been sitting far away invites you to visit him.

In a group, talking is allowed between members, though not quite encouraged, and if your conversation is animated enough, others are permitted to join in, politely of course.

How can I help the occasional glance at the eyes of the girl sitting across from me, our knees nearly touching?  She too knows the game we are playing with our eyes.  She looks down toward the floor as I stare over her head at the people beyond.  Our eyes meet for a moment as I turn to look out the window and she raises her eyes to look down the aisle.  We both break the stare almost immediately.

Looking out the window, I observe her covertly in the reflection.  Her eyes are closed now, feigning sleep, but I know that she is fully awake.  This is only a temporary ruse to avoid looking into other people's eyes.  But I cannot watch her, even covertly, for too long.  It is too risky.

Later, as I'm shifting my restless gaze once more, our eyes catch again.  This time I am the one who breaks the gaze first, looking downward, attempting to appear embarrassed.

How do I pursue a girl who is obviously on her way to work?  What do I say to a girl whose language I hardly speak?  I play with my hands, hoping that her downcast eyes might notice and find the movement somehow thrilling.

As my stop approaches, she too stands up, gracefully in contrast to my fumbling.  But by the time I get my bag down off the rack, she is lost amidst the crowd, and I stand there, in the middle of intersecting corridors, unsure of where to go.  Looking at the faces that stream past me, I the solitary unmoving man in a sea of moving faces, holding his suitcase as if it will somehow protect him from the endless press of bodies."

At long last i found myself on the highway with the top down, no hat in the rain.  alive again, i enjoyed the ecstasy of sublime movement.  in the car, i told asa what greg had been unable to tell him the night before.  in front of bernie, even if she had fouled the beanbag and floor in that unnatural way people have of regurgitating their tasty beverages, it would still have been wrong to describe her bitchiness while kyle tried to clean her up in the next room.  despite the mint leaves, her mess was catching; asa filled a cup in one go before he hurried up the stairs.  no one throws up from smoking, greg says, and i am forced to disagree.  there was one time, i explain, when asa had taken too many hits from the gravity.  strange that they had found me at chris's house last evening, intending to have a quiet night.  he, on 3 hours of sleep, with a girl to call, had declined an invitation to join us.  but i'm glad i've finished off my tequila, even if some of it may have gone to waste, because i can't bring it with me to paris.  i'll be a free man for a week and a half, living on other people's money.  i won't have to call extension 230 every day.    i'll set my own schedule and wander the streets at my own pace.  for now i am stuck trying to play hotel california, american football filling the room."

"event","So I've decided to create a live journal, my new year's resolution.
Here it is, in all it's stupendous glory.

The purpose of this journal is to give me a reason to write on a *hopefully* more regular basis.  I imagine that one or two people might read one or two entries once or twice, but the entertainment of others isn't really my goal here.  I want to give myself an incentive to be creative verbally.  I hope that what i write surpasses a simple emotive expression of my current state and evidences a more imaginative idiom.  I want to clean up my diction, and move toward a more succinct and expressive vocabulary.

That said, i present this journal to the masses in my mind."

bad news:

so i'm having this field trip thing on the 15th and 16th where i get to design a comercial for anti-smoking  (<lj user=""greedyslayer""> did this before).  However on the 15th and 16th, we're having our last days of rehearsal before the concert (17th)!  (I play the cello.)  You see, starting from today, at school we only have this Friday, and then the 15th and 16th left to practice before our performance!  On the last 2 days, we're going to be making last-minute adjustments and stuff, and learning how to walk in, where to sit - things like that!  So, yeah.  I can't do the anti-smoking thing.  *sigh*  This sucks.

good news that really doesn't matter anymore:

i'm the best cello-player in class.  i'm better than two people who have been playing for two years.  i get to play a solo. whoopee.  i'm so happy.  let's throw our hands in the air.

and scream.

sream.

very loudly.

sounds good to me.

Title:  The Graceful Assassin
Fandom:  Kingdom Hearts 2
Summary:  Luxord and Axel discover Marluxia
Rating:  G
<p>
<lj-cut text=""Axel clapped his hands encouragingly."">
<center><b>The Graceful Assassin</b></center>
<p>
Axel clapped his hands encouragingly.  ""Very impressive, Luxord.  Very impressive.""
<p>
Razor-sharp cards erupted from Luxord's hands and punctured his gambler minions with great force, sometimes severing a limb.  Lassoing a dusk with a dusk with a string of cards, he flung it across the training room effortlessly.  He tossed explosive dice at the surrounding nobodies, and he grinned.  He too was impressed with his new powers.
<p>
Luxord snapped his fingers, and the field of nobodies vanished instantly.  He walked up the stairs to greet Axel.
<p>
He ran his pale hand through his flaming red hair casually, and he bent down to scratch his knee.  ""You seen Demyx?""
<p>
""A couple hours ago I heard him humming something about a sanctuary.  Hey Axel, do you play poker?""  Luxord pulled a battered deck of cards out of his pocket and waved them around enticingly.
<p>
<center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</center>
<p>
""Oh.  What happened here?""  Axel said, pointing at the chipped paint on the white table.  Being a very keen observer, he was sure to notice every detail of his surroundings.  It was raining, as usual, and Axel's hair was drenched in the empty precipitation of the World That Never Was.  Axel glanced at Luxord, who was busy dealing.
<p>
""Demyx,"" he growled without looking up.  Once done dealing, he stood up and stretched.  His eyes widened abruptly in disbelief.  ""Now that's an odd sight,"" for over the ledge of Havoc's Divide, there was a huge white swarm of dusks running, dashing, jumping, and floating towards Memory's Skyscraper.  ""Let's go check it out.""
<p>
Stepping into a portal to darkness summoned by Axel, Luxord and Axel wondered what was going on.  <i>I've been here for a week, and there's already some excitement.  What a treat.</i>
<p>
<center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</center>
<p>
""Wow, she's kind of hot.""  Axel and Luxord perched on top of Memory's Skyscraper, watching with interest as the stranger with long, rosy pink hair fought the surrounding cloud of dusks.  With her small pocket knife she gracefully wove in and out of the curious dusks.  They watched her with interest as she attempted to harm them with her pitiful excuse for a weapon.
<p>
""Um, Axel, that's a guy,"" Luxord said, followed by an awkward silence.  ""Axel, are you-""
<p>
""No, I'm not!""  Axel blushed furiously.  ""Do you think we should go down and help her - uh, him?""
<p>
""Why bother going down?""  Luxord summoned a pillar of cards, shielding the stranger from the lower nobodies, who weren't even attacking.  He snapped his fingers, and the cards became a platform beneath the stranger's feet.  The stranger looked disoriented, but kept his balance well as the platform took him to the peak of Memory's Skyscraper.  He stepped off onto the roof, where Luxord and Axel were standing, and held his knife in front of him protectively.  Droplets of water fell from his flowery hair onto the knife, making a soft <i>clink</i>.  A look of fearful confidence showed clearly on his taut countenance.
<p>
Luxord stared at Axel.  ""Do you think he's a no-""
<p>
""Yep.""
<p>
""Take him to Superior?""
<p>
""Yep.""
<p>
Luxord constricted the struggling stranger with a rope of cards as Axel opened a portal to darkness.  Luxord shoved the stranger inside, and the three nobodies were wisked away to the Altar of Naught.
<p>
<center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</center>
<p>
""Luxord, I am afraid you must give Marluxia the Orientation.  Axel is barely what you could call 'capable.'  I would do it myself, but I have other, more important matters to attend to.  Now go.  Teach Marluxia, the Graceful Assassin, everything.

Title:  Demyx Gets a Royal Rainbow and Luxord Gets a Paper-cut
Fandom:  Kingdom Hearts 2
Rating:  G
Summary:  Luxord develops his odd method of fighting
Disclaimers:  I DON'T OWN KINGDOM HEARTS 2 (but I own a copy of the game)

<center><b>Demyx Gets a Royal Rainbow and Luxord Gets a Paper-cut</b></center>

Luxord walked down the hall to his room in his new coat and boots.  The hollow sound of his solemn footsteps bounced off of the blindeningly white walls and surrounded him.  Passing a few more doors, he came to his:


<center><b><i>Luxord
#10
The Gambler of Fate</i></b></center>


Placing his gloved hand on the doorknob, he twisted and pushed.  <i>Nice setup</i>, he thought as he entered his new living quarters.  <i>A lot better than the streets.</i>  He flopped onto his twin-sized bed and stared at the ceiling.  Too much had happened in the past few hours.

Superior had taught him what he was - a nobody: one of the side-effects of the loss of a hearts.  He was accepted by neither light nor dark, and he teetered on the brink of existence.  He was an outcast, along with all the other members of the Orginazation.  They were all nobodies.

It was brutal really, the way Superior taught him how the nobodies came into existence (or nonexistence as the case may be).  Using a live human, he had a neoshadow steal her heart, thus resulting in another heartless, and a nobody.  Luxord thought the mission of collecting hearts was questionably harsh, but he would give anything to be whole again.  He hated the knowledge and feeling of being empty - of being nothing.  On the other hand, he felt he fit in with the Orginazation.  He finally felt he was home.

Luxord snapped his fingers and a portal to the realm of darkness appeared.  He looked down at his fingers with a more-than-satisfactory admiration.  <i>Nifty.</i>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<i>Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.</i>

The rhythmic thumping of Demyx's fingers on wood permeated the tense silence of Havoc's Divide.  The usually still air seemed agitated and annoyed.  The white paint on the table had began to peel where Demyx's calusses collided with the gambling surface.

<i>Taptaptap.  Taptaptaptap.</i>

""Demyx!""  Luxord growled.  He glared at his opponent.  ""You've been sitting there for the last half-hour tapping your fingers on this cheap table!  The cards you have are the cards you have!  Now, are you going to bet, or are you going to fold!""  Luxord hated playing poker, or any card game for that matter, with Demyx.  He would've rather played with Saix, or Axel, but they were both out, doing who-knows-what.  <i>It's like he's trying to make me want to strangle him</i>, Luxord thought.  <i>He just sits there, tapping his fingers and humming his stupid tune.</i>

Demyx pushed in 10 munnys to the middle of the table.

Luxord looked at his cards.  He had a straight.  Considering he options, he thought about what kind of hand Demyx had.  Well, Demyx didn't seem like the king of person to play poker.  He knew Demyx would probably never bet on anything good.  Nonetheless, Luxord had to consider the fact that Demyx might get lucky and win, so he didn't raise too much.

""I see your 10, and I raise you 5.""  Luxord triamphuntly threw in 15 munnys, followed by Demyx, who added 5 more munnys to the pot.

Luxord smirked and spread his cards on the table.  He arched his eyebrows and looked at Demyx expectantly.  Demyx reluctantly laid down his hand: 2,4, 5, 9, and an Ace.  ""They're all the same color.  I have a Royal Rainbow,"" he said confidently.  ""I win.""  He began to sweep the munnys to his side.

<i>I guess Demyx just isn't meant for gambling.</i>  ""Sorry Demyx, but <i>I</i> win.  You have nothing.""  Demyx looked hurt.

When Luxord was done gathering his winnings, Demyx stepped out of his chair and stretched.  ""I'm not sure if I'm gonna play cards with you again, Lux.  I think my munny is just.... <i>attracted</i> to you,"" he said.  He stepped through the door to Proof of Existence.

Luxord laughed.  He was finally fitting in somewhere.  He finally knew people.  He had left his life of living on the streets, barely clinging onto existence.  Now, he had let go of existence.  Now he was nothing.  Maybe that's all he was meant to be.

He snapped his fingers and the table and chairs vanished, just as his old life had, right before his eyes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""Hey, Xigbar, you play poker?""  Luxord was in the training room training against a few of his gambler nobodies.  Sweat soaked his brow as he dodged back and forth between the swift streams of cards spewing from his underlings.  The dim light of the room provided a good training environment, and allowed the Gambler of Fate to home in on his senses.

""Gotta love it!""  Xigbar was of course at the shooting range.  All the targets had been demolished, and they looked as if they had been chewed into.

""Where'd you get that gun?"" Luxord asked enviously while he threw punches at the gamblers.  He eyed Xigbar as he applied pressure tot he trigger of his unique weapon.  A couple of bright red lasers shot out of the gun and hit the target right on the dot.

""Crossbow, actually.  I won it playing poker, matter o' fact.  I was playin' with some hooded guy I met in Twilight Town,"" Xigbar replied indignantly as he fired a couple more rounds.

""I am sorry.  The shooting range is - am sorry - am sorry - a - a - am - s - so - s - sor - am - sorry - a -"" the shooting range croaked, and then it exploded into tiny chunks of metal and wire.

""Fine!  Be that way!""  Xigbar scowled, and stormed up the stairs and out of the room.

Luxord chuckled a little as his foot came in contact with a gambler's face.  <i>Xigbar is...... weird</i>.

Luxord felt a sharp stinging pain in his shoulder and looked to his left.  There was a paper-cut left by one of the gamblers' cards.  That gave him and idea....

"event","I'm applying for Luxord in an RP, and I thought maybe you would like to read it.  Feedback is welcome! :)

Application:


<b>LJ Username: <lj user=""maes_guin""></b>
<b>Character You Are Applying For: Luxord</b>
<b>Character Interpretation (basically...your take on the character and what makes them tick--if you are applying for an Org member, we want some background on who their Somebody may have been...):
Somebody:</b>
As all nobodies were, Luxord was once somebody.  Dulor was born into an extremely poor family in Hollow Bastion.  His father drank away all their money, while his mother was turned into a heartless when he was only six.  His five brothers were all older than him, and worked hard to keep the family going.  Dulor was witty, and sometimes a smartaleck.  One day, Dulor's pitiful house, that was more of a shack, caught fire and was turned to ashes.  Only Dulor survived.  Dulor, age 14, was forced to live on the streets, surviving on scraps of food, and charity from the more fortunate.  3 years after the incident, he discovered he had a nack for gambling.  He was a very strategical thinker, and when it came to poker, he was the best.  Playing poker on the streets with a deck of cards given to him by his mother, Nareel, he was able to scavenge a living.  However, Dulor's ""winning streak"" came to an end when his heart was taken by a NeoShadow.
<b>Nobody:</b>
Looking around bewildered, Dulor found himself in the World that Never Was.  Confused and disoriented, he found a colossal castle.  Hobbling up the steps, he collapsed at the entrance.  Xemnas found him, and he was sure.  This nobdoy would be Luxord, #10 in Organization XIII.  Xemnas recognized his strategically advanced mind and knew that Luxord would bring Xemnas one step closer to obtaining his goal: Kingdom Hearts.
Luxord learned that his mother, Nareel, had in fact become a nobody, Larxene.  Luxord was hopeful of finding her, but his hopes vanished just as Nareel had.  Larxene had been killed by the keyblade weilder, Sora.  Luxord didn't care who this Sora was - Sora would pay for the death of Larxene.  This hate for Sora burned within him, and Luxord devised a new way of fighting.  By using his inhuman gambling skills, he was able to use cards and dice to harm his foes.
Luxord loved his new home.  He loved always having something to do, some hearts to take.  It was so much better than his past life on the streets.  Him and Demyx became close friends.  Usually, Luxord preffered to be alone, but he always welcomed the company of the slightly annoying Demyx.
<b>A Sample of ""In-Character"" Writing (at least 2-3 paragraphs):</b>
<i>Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.</i>
The rhythmic thumping of Demyx's fingers on wood permeated the tense silence of Havoc's Divide.  The usually still air seemed agitated and annoyed.  The white paint on the table had began to peel where Demyx's calusses collided with the gambling surface.
<i>Taptaptap.  Taptaptaptap.</i>
""Demyx!""  Luxord growled.  He glared at his opponent.  ""You've been sitting there for the last half-hour tapping your fingers on this cheap table!  The cards you have are the cards you have!  Now, are you going to bet, or are you going to fold!""  Luxord hated playing poker, or any card game for that matter, with Demyx.  He much preffered playing with Saix, or Axel, but they were both out, doing who-knows-what.  <i>It's like he's trying to make me want to strangle him</i>, Luxord thought.  <i>He just sits there, tapping his fingers and humming his stupid tune.</i>
Demyx pushed in 10 munnys to the middle of the table.
Luxord looked at his cards.  He had a straight.  He knew Demyx too well.  He knew Demyx never bet on anything good.  Nonetheless, Luxord had to consider the fact that Demyx might get lucky and win, so he didn't raise too much.
""I see your 10, and I raise you 5.""  Luxord triamphuntly threw in 15 munnys, followed by Demyx, who added 5 more munnys to the pot.  Luxord smirked and spread his cards on the table.  He arched his eyebrows and looked at Demyx expectantly.  Demyx reluctantly laid down his hand: 2,4, 5, 9, and an Ace.  ""They're all the same color,"" he said confidently.  ""I win.""  He began to sweep the munnys to his side.
<i>I guess Demyx just isn't meant for gambling.</i>  ""Sorry Demyx, but <i>I</i> win.  You have nothing.""  Demyx looked hurt.
When Luxord was done gathering his winnings, Demyx stepped out of his chair.  ""I remember when I would play with Larxene.  She was a lot like you, Lux.  See you around,"" he said.  He stepped through the door to Proof of Existence.
Luxord grunted.  <i>You're lucky Demyx.  I never got to play with Nareel, or Larxene.</i>  He got up out of his chair and  looked up towards the growing Kingdom Hearts.  ""SORA!!!!!""
He snapped his fingers and the table and chairs vanished, just like everything good in his life from long ago.
<b>A Vague Idea of Where you would like to Take your Character/What you Want out of this RP:</b>
In Port Royal, the first time I saw Luxord, I thought immediately, <i>Who is this guy?  He's awesome!</i>  I was totally looking forward to see Luxord have an active role in the game, and was utterly disappointed when he appeared in, what, two or three cutscenes?  I thought he was wrongly underdeveloped, for he was such an awesome guy.  To be able to make him the nobody he never was is basically what I want to do.  I want to make it feel like he actually was in the game, that he wasn't just some nobody (no pun intended).  I'm not exactly sure where I'm going to take him, but I have some ideas.  I just want to make sure he doesn't end up <i>nowhere</i>.

Anyway, so.... I don't know what to do today.  I'm going to the mall with my friend to see Benchwarmers, but then we're actually going to do stuff at the mall.  What am I supposed to do there?  I don't look at clothes!  For me malls are solely for Gamestop, Borders, and some type of cookie place...  My god!!  What am I going to do today!!!!

Also, I have this super-hard problem thing I need to do for school:

Okay, so there are eight pills on a table.  They are all exactly the same, except one is poisonous and weighs a fraction more than the others.  You're given a weighing scale.  You have to be able to find out which pill is poisonous in two tries, and it has to work every time.

In history, it's so cool!  We're learning stuff about Buddhism, Siddhartha, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path... It's all so cool!!!  (and so is my new layout, but I must work out the kinks!!)

I'm also reading this really good book,  Maximum Ride:  The Angel Experiment.  It's awesome, and I suggest you read it.  The main character reminds me of Buffy Summers.  Anyway, I was reading in the car today on the way home from Sizzlers and my brother was doing this annoying roaring thing.  (I wouldnt' have considered it annoying if it wasn't such a good part in the book!!)  I was at this really awesome, sad, serious, important part, right?  And so I'm pretty much numb, like when Dumbledore died, I guess you could say, or when Aeris died.  Well anyway, I'm numb, and I hear my brother making loud weird sounds in my ear.  It totally ruined the moment...  So as soon as I got home, I reread it! :)  For those of you who will never read the book, here's what i was numb about (note, they are spoilers):










So, the main character Max(also a scientific mutant, part bird, part human) kills this evil mutant guy (scientific mutant, pard wolf, part human) named Ari.  Ari is the son of this dude (Jeb) that broke Max out of this evil lab place, but Ari was mutated into a wolf-dude.  Jeb took care of her like a father for two years, and then he disappeared.  Two years after disappearing, Max found out Jeb actually worked for the evil lab.  Anyway, so Max accidentally killed Ari (they were fighting).  Max is flying away, when she hears Jeb screaming ""You killed him!  You killed your own brother!""  That last line nearly brought me to tears.  It was such a sad schocker.

End of spoiler.

I DON'T WANNA WAIT!!  I could rant and tell you how I've been waiting for a long time and stuff like that, but I'll save you the trouble.  Aren't I so nice?

....I had found instructions to make a keyblade the other day, and I was going to bookmark it today, in case I ever needed it.  But I can't find it!  If you know where it is, can you tell me plz!!

Today, my friend Steven and I had a sub in 1st in 2nd per.  He gave us an assignment where we had to get in groups of two and write down a dialogue between Socrates and Plato before Socrates' death, discussing honor.  When the two of us worked together, it came out really well.  Usually, I'm bad at working in groups, but when we wrote together, it was really good. We decided we're going to try to do a KH fic together later. ^_^

KH - 1 day!!  (2 days till i get it... waah!!)"

I have to stop watching the KH2 promo on youtube.  It's desensitizing me.  I can't let that happen before I even get the game!  Oh, and the KH ending has lost its specialness now.  I found it on youtube. : (

I heart my icons!  Check 'em out!

Spoiler's for those who have not watched Sun's most recent episode:













OMG!  Sun's pregnant!  I think Sun's gonna die.  She going to die.  And that new guy is so an other!  He provokes Jack and Locke, and he's just so otherish.... wow... Next week's episode is going to be so awesome!  Can't wait!


Now for other stuffy stuff:


I haven't updated my journal for awhile - I've been busy.  I've already beat CoM, but I want to beat it again so I can be ready for KH2. (I'm Riku in Destiny Islands now. :) )  I've also been beating Sephiroth repeatedly in KH. I'm trying to boost everyone to lv. 100. Curent stats - Goofy-100, Donald-95, Sora-98.  And....I've been obsessing over the KH2 promo on youtube.  A pretty crammed schedule, don't you agree?"

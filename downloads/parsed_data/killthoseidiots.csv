BLAH.<br /><br />V, there's gotta be other JCs out there that will accept you!!! of course they're probably worse, they'll never be the BEST that you wanted, but just like me, we gotta make do with the shit we've got in our lives :p&nbsp;<br /><br /><font color=""#800000"">know that you are much loved by Strawberry, okay?</font>"

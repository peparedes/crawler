"event","It's been a looooooooooooong time since I've even bothered to look at this thing.  I've done so much over the past however long it's been that it's mind boggling. 

 First off, I finally started off on my dream career in game design by enrolling at Collins College.  I'm about 3 months through it, and right now it's boringly easy to get through those classes.  I guess one of these days something will come up and challenge me, but until then it's time to yawn all the way to an A.

Since the classes are so easy, I've decided to take it upon myself to make things a bit harder and get some experience at the same time.  The other day I was at the bar with my friend and he came up with this weird idea; that we actually sit down and develop a game.  He pitched the idea, and while it seemed like he barely thought about what needs to happen with developing a game, I felt I could help him through it and took the reigns of the operation.  

As of right now, I'm kind of unskilled.  I slacked off on my C++ programming and now I'm cramming as hard as I can to get proficient at it in the next 2 months to start development.  I've already got a lot of backing from my other friends; at least 5 people signed on to help with the project so far, in various fields.  I'm going to set up a meeting this week with everyone to get this shit started.

It'll be so fun to try to balance everything out, and I believe that I'm just the person for the challenge.  I hope that everyone else is up to it, because there's nothing that makes you feel better than seeing your baby make it, whether that baby be your offspring, or your creation.

I'll probably end up being a lot more friendly to my livejournal now, just to get the development woes out."

"event","Not very much to say right now.  It's time for work and I just got up.  I've been meaning to update this thing but I've always been sidetracked with my games.  

Currently I'm on a binge to try and finish a game called dodonpachi without continuing.  It's one of those vertical scrolling shooters, but as many as like 150 bullets can be on the screen at one time.  I can get to the 3rd level on a good day.  Maybe I'll remember to keep anyone who actually reads this posted.

My baby comes in less than a short month, can't wait for that.  I finally get to see if it's a boy or a girl since Amanda's doctor is so remedial and does not want to schedule another ultrasound and the first one proved nothing.

Ah well, time to get to work."

"event","Good ol' toasty has been skipping his blog updating duties.  But now, all of that is over

nothing has really changed, except for the fact that I've actually gotten serious about learning how to program.  I've gotten a very good book for the job:  Beginning Visual C++ by Ivor Horton.  I highly suggest it over the piece of crap that was C++ for dummies.  

I swear that C++ for dummies just throws random code into their book, explains ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the code, then just moves on like you should grasp the whole concept just by looking at the code.

I quit trying for 6 months over that book.  But one day something rekindled my interest for programming, and I knew that the stupid book I was reading would not get me anywhere else, so I decided to get the book I'm reading now.  Now I understand the things that C++ for dummies left me baffled when they gave me their run of it.  I still have much to learn, but at least I can understand what I'm doing now."

"event","I spent yet another glorious day going through the various reservation compaints of my work, which is U haul international.  It's a good job, you basically don't do shit and get paid for it.  It's great.  However, some situations bring a lot of depression into the job.

For one, being in the position that I am, I take at least 150 calls from disgruntled customers wanting to know where their truck is.  Most of the time, the truth is, that uhaul overbooked it and the only way that a customer can guarantee is truck is either by walk in or by harassing the respective pickup location in my opinion. Unfortunately, due to having to be polite and not saying anything bad about the company, I just have to blurt off random scripted responses and transfer them to the person that can assist them--or as I call it, put them on hold for god knows how long or just leave their phones on the closed message so the customer just keeps on calling the call center back, in which the only thing we can do for these people is to transfer them back to that particular place--which makes a lot of angry customers, and a lot of depressed workers.

another thing is the supervisors.  a good 75 percent of my supervisors don't do anything at all.  They sit by the supervisor desk, chatting about their boyfriends and stupid little things all day while everyone is on the phone with extremely difficult customers and we need their help.  when you call them (mind you, I usually sit not even 10 inches away from the supervisor desk) it takes 5-8 mins, in which the customer who was on hold has already given up.  It would be great if we could get some new supervisors, but unfortunately with a manager that hardly takes any disciplinary action, that's less than likely. We do have some great sups there though, my babygirl....regardless of the fact that she is my girlfriend, she does an excellent job at maintaining the chaos that the other sups leave behind and actually answers when her agents are in need. 

But one co-worker always brightens up my day.  She always is saying something rude to the customers, but the manager never does anything about it, the sups are too busy talking, and everyone else just laughs.  just today a person asked her if she worked for uhaul and she replied ""What do you mean, do I work for Uhaul?  I answered the phone, didn't I?""  Isn't all that funny in writing, but when there's a disgruntled customer on the line and you hear that in response to their question, it's bound to make you crack a smile.

It's also kind of funny how when you work in the customer service department most of the agents get a bad impression of the company as a whole.  While at work I constantly hear people talking about how they should've went with penske or ryder (although at the moment penske's trucks look mighty good--if they break down though, no road service for them, unlike uhauls 24/7 breakdown line) based on the experiences of the customers who reserved their truck the day before their move and think that they are going to get it before the other 55 people who reserved early.  It's kind of depressing when the employees of a company start to develop a hatred for it(that probably happens everywhere else, too) 

I used to think that, but when I was bored at work I did more research, and uhaul is actually replacing the shitty trucks and selling them in return for some new shiny ones, from what I've heard we fufill more reservations than airlines, and we supply so many more things than trucks, that you couldn't fathom it.  Why, just about a year ago Uhaul started a moving program called emove, where they actually find local movers for you and have them rated by other customers who used the services.  

For such a simple job, I sure did write a lot.  But I guess Uhaul has grown on me, and I wish to do more for the company, but until someone either gets canned or demoted I can't do much more than transfer them.  It kinda sucks, but one day, someone will fuck up, and I'll be there to better serve the company in their place"

"event","At the pinnacle of my beatmania skills, I leave my house just shortly after getting my first AA on a 7 star song to go to my friend's house for a second

I come back, and all that's left of my ps2 and gamecube collection is my beatmania controller and my donkey konga.

I was robbed.

Selective little shits, I thought as I searched around for any missing things.  They left a nintendo 64, various PSX RPGs, and any other games they thought sucked.  They threw my mom's christmas present all over the place, just so they could use the bag that it was in to put more of my games in as they made a mad dash out of my house. 

That pissed me the hell off, but what really got me going is the message that my ""freind"" sent me in regards to it.  here it is, edited to keep anyone's names out of it:

--------------------------------------------
daaaaaaaaaaaaat (this is the equivalent of ha! you got fucked up)

so much for dont know/dont care attitudes

you guys got baaaaad habits from (roomate 1) and with (roomate 2)'s mentality of dont give a damn has made you finally pay the price.

i have a general idea of who it is but i wont say a thing because its not 100% accurate.

if i was still living there, it wouldnt have happened but you can contribute that to (roomate 2).

---------------------------------------------

firstly, why the hell would anyone who considers themself a friend write anything saying ""that's what you get"" the day after you get robbed.  That's pretty damn heartless, and to call yourself a friend?

secondly, what the hell does any of my roomates' bad habits have to do with someone breaking a window and climbing in to steal all of my shit?  I don't really see any price I paid, I mean, my roomates could have bad habits......but really, I don't understand how I could have prevented this.

thirdly, this person has a suspicion of who the person is, but won't tell me?  what kind of secret bullshit is he pulling?  why would he not give me his idea of who it might be, so justice may be served, and I could maybe recover my things?  How could anyone who considers themselves a friend just decide tease you and tell you that he may know who it is but won't tell you?  that's shit that happened on playgrounds. 

and finally, if he was there, he would've most likely went the same place that I went, for me and all of my roomates went there at the same time.

maybe I'll post more about this person later, but for now let this crap set in."

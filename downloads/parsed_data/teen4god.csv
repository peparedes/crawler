"event","so. whats happened in the last 22 days?
well i've been to the dr 3 times, had bronchitis (which i didn't go to the dr about), decided i like Sam (and i think God's meddling in my life), still haven't figured out what i'm doing next year, haven't done any work (in 2 weeks i have 1 essay, 3 essay drafts, and assignment and a seminar due) which is bad.
so i went to the dr (on wed) cos i wasn't sleeping (it'd been like 2 weeks, and i wasnt tired), so i waltzed up said 'i'm not sleeping, its really annoying, and oh i've been pretty depressed the last 10 years', so i nearly got diagnosed with cyclothymia or manic depression, then i had heapsa bloodtests. so the next friday i went back, bloodtests didn't show anything, oh i forgot, they decided to do bloods to check out polycystic ovaries. sleeping pills had only just started working then. so i left the dr with iron tablets, and fluroxetine (aka prozac aka antidepressent) and the dr was going to ring the endocrinologist to discuss my symptoms and lack of bloodwork showing up stuff.
so today (monday) i got a phonecall from my dr asking me to make an appointment, which i did. so i went to the dr, and she said the endo reckoned its PCOS, which kinda sucks. so i'm contemplating what i wanna do with it.
did i mention my parents are in Nairobi at the moment? on saturday they bus to Tanzania.
i also have the interesting challenge of living off $70 a week for the next 8 weeks; my rent is $90 so should be interesting lol.
i think this is a crash course in trusting in God; yet another one for this year. guess i'll wait and see what happens.
everything keeps getting better, i feel good and coping with life, then another curveball hits, but i'm coping pretty well at hte moment. i have a feeling tonight will be hard but i'll manage.
this year has been weird. its weird to like my ex-flatmate. i keep randomly bumping into him (so unless he's stalking me...) when i most need someone to make me smile, and he can actually make me do that, which is weird, cos only Trent's managed that before... and i'm over him now (about 7 months later lol)
but i really need to go write my essay..."

the next one here is on the 28th april - 30th(my bday) april... i'm so excited, mostly because a few years i had a vision of the indoor sports stadium here being packed with people praising God and hearing about Him, and it being a unified citywide church thing, and i so think this is the result of my vision... then its onto our outside one...(or which i also had another vision...) i love it when visions and stuff dont makes too much sense or seem possible, and then u see them startin to happen.

therefore a human spider is where u form that in ur stomach and then expell it out by means of vommitting...
it was funny. i ate like 800mL of vanilla icecream, drunk about 1L of coke, and then jumped up and down, spun round and round, jumped and spun and just tried to mix it all up... we did this(i did it with my flatmate(aka roommate)) for about 30mins... then i was sittin down feeling gross when i started to feel nauseus... got the whole excessive saliva and then i chundered(aka spewed/vomitted) once... then sara(flatmate) vomitted 3 times... it stunk... we have pics and a vid(of bits of it) hehe.. we are gonna be either church freaks or church legends... it will spread too fast.

i love our anthem its so God based... but yet no1 hardly ever sings it all... the 5 verses are awesome, the 1st one is mostly sung alone, and if and others are sung it stops after the 2nd verse. we sung it at a christian conference and they only did the 1st verse, i could just feel the power and presence of God, it was awesome, i really think we should start our church services with it, i mean we are dedicated enough to our national sports 2 sing it before them, why cant we be so passionate that our nations will be God based and sing it in church, revive the God in our country our land our world... unite as one under God and raise up Godfearing and God-honouring people, make a difference in the world..."

Good bye everyone!

So much has changed and I don't even know where to begin. No one is ever there for me. Everyone just stopped talking to me. I don't really give a fuck about anyone anymore and I can't wait to move and start new somewhere else. I hate it when people think they can just come back into my life as if months haven't just passed. Why does it feel like I'm the one trying to establish or rekindle relationships with people? 
This place is so fucked up."

 [x]        [Math]                     [Math]

And if you couldn't guess I have Saturday, Sunday and Monday's off. Which I am pretty happy about. Though I'm sure I will get a job and will no longer have any free time. I'm glad most of my classes start in the morning and don't go too far into the afternoon. It definitely won't be like highschool where we had to sit in a classroom on end for six hours and I am pretty happy about that.

10 more days until I go to California to see my love.
I am so excited."

"event","So today I am going for a hike up to some mountain place that supposedly is known for having a bunch of art sculptures at the top. I am pretty excited for that, well...dreading the hike. But I would really like to see what these sculptures look like. Maybe I will be inspired and start doing my own sculptures. But who knows.

So I guess things have been pretty good lately, I have just been trying to keep myself occupied so the days will go by faster hopefully. I really want to go to California and see Kelly right now. I'm probably going to cry again when I have to leave. I hope my mom decides to stay an extra night, I'm almost positive she will.

In other news August 13th I have to swing by my school and pick up my year book. I'm not really looking forward to that because I really don't want to see anyone I went to school with besides my obvious friends. I probably won't even stick around that long to have people sign it and what not. Well, only the people I care for. The rest of them can go to hell.

"event","So much has changed. Literally. Alex and myself are no longer going out for many different reasons. I am not going to get into it seeing as this journal is on the internet and people who know me but don't exactly know everything about me can easily access it and I don't want that. I will just say that everything happens for a reason and I'm a firm believer in that now. I know I said I was going to marry Alex and all but I'm not. I was young and stupid. We met when we were 15 years old and went out for three years. Of course I thought that I was going to. I didn't know what else was out there, though. At one point I was completely obsessed, my relationship with Alex was sickening on both behalfs and personally I'm surprised it even lasted as long as it did. I mean, we did have our little break up's here and there but still. Our relationship was like taking drugs, in the beginning its all fun and adventurous but in reality it is slowly killing you. Our relationship was slowly killing me. I was slipping quickly into depression, I was desperate for him to love me like he used to and he never did. Till this day he claims that he loves me but I know that if I went back to him within a week it would be the same old shit. Plus, I will never go back to him. I am very happy where I am at right now. I am in love with another who loves me back and things couldn't be better. The way he looks at me and hugs me and even gives me kisses, I can tell that he loves me. I just feel so comfortable around him, like I have known him forever or something. He is everything I want and is everything I need and I am lucky I finally found the one for me. Sure, I have had some fun times with Alex that I will always remember but the bad over ruled the good. We would have fun and then the next day be at eachothers throats. Kelly and myself haven't even been in a fight, let alone I could never imagine me treating him like I treated Alex. Or kelly treating me like how Alex did. Like, I wish I could describe how fucked up it was but I just don't know how to put it into words. I hope people understand though, I know all of Alex's friends probably hate me but oh well what can I do? If you're going to hate me because I wanted out of a relationship then that's your problem. It's saddening how much Alex's friends based their status with me off of mine and Alex's relationship. If I was in a fight with Alex, they were in a fight with me. It's like I wasn't even human to them. All I know is I never want to be how I was before, I've never felt so low in my life. Just the other day I was reading my other journal entries in notebook that I have written in and they were all so depressing. It was hard to believe that the girl who wrote all of those were me. I feel like it was a completely different person...Anyways, I'm sure I will write more in this another time. Hopefully I won't forget about it again."

"event","I am home from my journey to New Hampshire. It was a lot of fun, actually. I think I needed time to just be alone with my family. When we first got to our little cottage, box thing. We unpacked and claimed our beds. There wasn't much claiming to do because there was only two beds. The place was literally as small as my room. Right when you walk in theres a bed then a sink and another small room with a bed, a toilet and a shower. All four of us could barely fit in it. There was no heat and the roof leaked when it began to rain but through it all it was a good time. I went to a fair and pet some animals, ate some candy apples and made fun of a few people. Haha. We ate at some nice places and enjoyed eachothers company.

I must say I am glad to be home, though. In a HOUSE with some HEAT and with my animals. :)

Also, not to mention closer to Alex. These four days apart from him made me realize how much I love and need him. He's the only one for me and no one can compare to his mere awesomeness. Sure, we have had our past conflicts but come April 15th we can officially say that we have been going out for three years and I am rather proud of that. 

Alex if you're reading this I hope you know that I love you! And I can't wait to come over again."

"event","So all day I have been craving to restart posting in this. I actually have quite a bit to say, amazingly.

First off let me say that I was fucking retarded for wanting a job. Perhaps it's just because the job I have at Dunkin Donut's absolutely blows. I hate just about everything about it, it's really not the job for me. So in conclusion, I am turning in my uniform shortly. Yup. And I am going to be working at TJ Maxx with my brother. When I walked into TJ Maxx I felt really comfortable and secure with the environment opposed to Dunkins I always want to shove my head in the coffee coolatta machine and drown myself. Tomorrow I have an interview at TJ Maxx and I am pretty pumped. I am 99% I will get the job and everything will be dandy.

Now let's talk about school! School has surprisingly been OK. The only thing about it I don't like is Mrs. Castner and I have my reasons. Besides that, all my teachers are nice and the day goes by rather quickly since I pretty much have all art classes, minus english. Which happens to be pretty cool, too. Ms. Kis let us watch 300 and the class goes by rather quickly.

And finally onto relationships. Oh woo. So lately Alex and myself haven't been getting along that well. Now, I am not going to go into depth with what happened because 1. I don't really want a lot of people knowing. 2. The person that caused half of can easily access this since we used to be on good terms. All I have to say is that sometimes with Alex I can be absoulutely swooned by the kid. On other days I just want to punch him in the face repeatedly. I'm sure you know which one I have been feeling recently.
In all, I think a break is needed. I do love him and will most likely love him for the rest of my life even if I am not with him and he is perfectly aware of this because I have told him so. I just hate how he can treat me like complete shit and then the next day expect everything to be all sunshine and flowers. Right now I am not too sure what I want to do. And I think I have a very tiny, miniture, interest in someone.

On a more happy note tomorrow I am going to a football game! I've never actually been to one so I guess I will see how it goes. Kim is taking me so I'm pretty excited because I have been wanting to hang out with her more because well, I don't know whats going to happen to me after senior year. I might be moving but my mom is still undecided. Anywho back to the topic at hand. I am also going to hang out with my newly found friends so I'm pretty happy about that too. It makes me realize how much I have changed over the years. If this was freshman year then you very well wouldn't see me at a football game, let alone with new people. I was very anti-social and didn't care to meet anyone new because I was content on where my life was and my life back then could be summed up into one word and that is 'Isolated' I didn't care that I was alone and stayed at home all day.
I'm still really shy, though, which I hate. But I'm sure that will never go away. But at least I am trying! 

Anywho,  I think I am going to watch tv or something.
Byeeee!"

Last night there was a big storm and Luke got out and he came back bleeding. I nearly had a heart attack. Now I know how mom's feel and stuff when their kid comes in from playing outside with a cut or something and they over react.

Well, this was more than a cut but still. I have no fucking clue what on Earth he did to get a cut on his back but let me tell you he definitely got TLC all night.

Speaking of all night, I listened to a whoooooole bunch of oooooooold music last night. So that was pretty fun. Took me down memory lane and what not. 

Aaaaaaaaand unfortunately it is 6:53 and I have to depart for school. Perhaps I shall write more about my school day or some gay shit later!

You would of thought it would be pretty lame but it was really cool. Then we went to walmart and me and my brother just couldn't stop laughing at the dumbest things. But it was nice. Then we came home and we painted a fucking box green. We still have to finish. But that was fun too. 

Then me and my brother watched V for Vendetta. That is such a kick ass movie. I loved the guy who played V, accent. But the movie really does get you thinking.

I was also thinking about cutting my hair up to my shoulders yesterday. I was all for it and I still kind of am. Long hair is such a pain in the ass. It always get's caught everywhere. People always touch it. People always talk about it. It sheds like crazy and overall I'm craving for the lightness. I still remember when I had my hair short in 5th grade and how light it felt. It was like heaven. But sadly, winter will be right around the corner and that's the whole reason why my hair is long. So I could keep fucking warm in the winter. It's also sort of a safety blanket. I'm sure if I cut it I would feel very, very naked.

I have to go to coinstar today. Even though I only have two dollars in coins, it's pissing me off having coins. I want some greens. Plus I won't feel as much lamer. I put the change in bags and marked them and everything. Hah.

All right, someone buy me a scanner. I really need one. I hate having to take picture's of my drawings when I can just put them under a scanner and voila. The picture is whole and on the computer. No, with a fucking camera you have to take the picture. Put it on the computer. Crop it and not get the whole entire picture on. It pisses me off. I just did this wicked cool picture last night. It's this chick holding a sniper rifle. I drew her, her own outfit and everything and I like how her shades came out."

"event","So, the game plan is:

1. Stop fucking talking to people.
2. Fucking schedule driving hours.
3. Fucking get a job.

What I'm trying to do, is tie the old Julie with a kick ass combination of a job and doing something new. 

Talking to new people has only made me: Hate them. 
I just can't do it. I can't talk to new people at all, like, I don't know if there was a point where my brain said ""Ok Julie, you met enough people..you don't need anymore."" But seriously, I can't tlak to new people. I suck at it. I try to be their friend but then everything just goes down the shitter.
So, if anyone who I don't know is reading this, here's an idea if you want to be my friend...talk to me! Because I just can't simply talk to you.

Anywho.

So, my mom calls me over at Alex's and wakes me up and she asks if I wanted to be picked up now, or at five. So I ask Alex when I should be picked up and he says five. So I tell her and everythings dandy. Hang up the phone and I go back to sleep. An hour later she calls back and this is how it went:

Me: Hello?
Her: (Typing on keyboard vigorously)
Me: Hello?
Her (Still.)
Me: (Hang up)
Me: (Call Back.)
Her: Hello?
Me: You called?
Her: I'm very pissed off at you! You broke the bureau shelf!
Me: Ok. I didn't mean to, though.
Her: I'm coming to pick you up so you can fix it!

So, I say fine and go back to sleep for a little more then Alex wakes me up all like ""Mom's here!"" Apparently she didn't even bother to call and just went to the front door and rang the door bell. So, I get in the van and what not and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall the way home we fight. I mean all the way. we didn't stop even when the van stopped. But yea, so I come home expecting to find this broken shelf but, gasp! It's nowhere to be found! 

So I'm searching everywhere for this hunk of shit and ask her where it was and she was like ""I think your step dad has it."" So I went downstairs in the fucking basement to see if he had and this is the part where I sceam ""WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!"" The fucking shelf she was so fucking worried about and was demanding me to fix, has been already fixed by him. So I just fucking go upstairs and tell her, ""You brought me all the way home to fix a broken shelf that has already been fixed."" She just stared at me as if I was talking like a fucking baby. Then when she did talk it was, ""Oh, then vaccum the hallway and stairs.""

The end."

"event","Turns out the chocolate was old. I knew it was too good to be true. Who would leave perfectly nice chocolate out on the table for me to pry at? Fuckers. 
I'm seriously being infested with bugs. Turns out when I closed my book to write the entry before this I managed to snag a bug on the front page. I love bug guts all over my brand new book. Not.


P.S.
The same holds true for Alex.
I will marry this kid and love him forever."

I stopped reading it soley to steal some chocolate off the dining room table. Whoever it belongs to I hope they don't miss it. 
I looked at the ceiling and it was Bug Fest 2006. I grabbed my notebook I am going to be using for drivers ed and killed those bitches. There was a hug spider there, too. His guts are now imprinted on the notebook. I need to clean that ASAP. I'm going to read more and eat some delicious chocolate. I will write more later.


P.S. 
I actually had a conversation with Alex. I love this kid."

"event","Today is my brother's birthday. He is now 23. I got him The Hills Have Eyes on dvd. So I guess I will watch that with him later.
I spent the night at Alex's, it was rather enjoyable. We watched some movies and enjoyed eachothers company. I love him. :)

I really need a job. I guess my brother is going to give me an application where he works so i can check it out, I want to work at Barns and Nobles, though. Somewhere where I don't have to deal with people 24/7 and can just help them when they need to find a book or of that matter. That would be nice. 

The new car I want is 2,450. I am looking into it. Since the other car I wanted has vanished once again.

My mom already payed for some of drivers ed. Now I onyl owe $25 on the first day. Woot."

"event","So I was right, the last day of school was good yet sucked. Good= It was the last day of school and I only went to one class for a final. Bad= Alex was a complete dick head. 
So yea, today is now saturday and all I have been doing thus far is sitting on my ass. Which isn't so bad. I went out to eat at the king buffet and saw Matt Nixon and Michael Marchand. It was funny. I also saw this girl that was in my gym class, I don't know if she noticed me or not it was fun, though. Then I went into walgreens with my brother and mom and I played with this whoopie cushion and people kept on staring. We also bought these two dolls that are like baby cheerleaders and we couldn't stop laughing when we made them sing at the same time. That's mainly why we bought them. Yesterday was a pretty weird day indded, a lot happened....between a. Me and Alex b. school d. people and c. my sister getting kicked out of the house. So yea, I'm really tired..."

"event","Today I slept a good percentage of it away and now I am listening to some funky soothing music which make's me want to sleep like a baby. Friday is the last day of school, which is rather exciting. I am sick of all the retards at my school and what they do to extend their retardedness moreso. I have been eating bubbleyum all afternoon and my jaw hurts.
Jason talked to me today, I guess that was nice. He wants to hang out with me this summer. I don't see that happening really. It would just be too weird plus I don't know how Alex would feel about that nor do I know how I entirely feel about it. 
I'm really sweaty and gross right now. I wish I had AC in my room but this tiny ass fan will have to do for now. 
I got in an argument with someone over the internet today because he just repeatidly spelt WEAPON as WAPPON.
Well it turns out that car hasn't been sold yet and it just mysteriously disapeared. I really want it. It's totally orgasmic and stuff. Lower the price from 5,500 to 2,200 or something damnit!
I love Alex and his face. Today he was looking at something and I don't know, just the way he was staring or whatever was really gorgeous but Alex is always gorgeous and I love him very much. He just better print me out that fucking picture tomorrow. <3"

"event","So, today my mom forgot me at my boyfriend's house. I ended up falling asleep like I always do and woke up to Alex telling me it was seven. So I was like ""omgwtf."" So I call my mom and her cellular device was off. So I'm like ""Ok I will try again later."" Try again still no answer so I call my sister asking where the fuck our mother has gone, I really needed a ride home and my brother didn't have any gas in his car. Alex wanted me to stay later so I just said screw it and stayed until nine ish and then his mom finally drove me home. It sucked so hard. When my mom got home I was like ""WHERE WERE YOU!?"" and turns out she went to some attorney for child support money and I was like ""LOL YOU FORGOT ABOUT YOUR CHILD"" and what's really weird is the fact I was watching the news the other night about this little boy being left at chucky cheese and was thinking how does someone do that and lol it happened to me! So yea, I'm prett pissed about that and stuff. It was nice spending time with Alex, though. He was all cuddly and kissy today and I loved it and I love him and I love his existance at this point. I really hope this continues because that would be awesome. 

Tomorrow is thursday and I need to find a ride home somehow. I guess I will ask my sister to see if her boyfriend can pick me up. I have a feeling tomorrow is going to be terribly boring. I won't get to see Alex after school and this saddens me. :(

Anywho I have to get my dirty ass in the shower and then wash my clothes.

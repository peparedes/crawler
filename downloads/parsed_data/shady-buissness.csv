"event","Ok so I kind of have a lot to say. First off I know I changed my feelings very fast. But i cant just dwell on something that could of been forever. And I didnt say I didnt like you anymore. Its just Im starting not to. Not because your a bad person just because I need to. I cant just sit here and wait for me and you to happen. Cause right now isnt the best time for it and becuase you said you wanted to wait. I cant just not like anyone else and wait until your ready to have a relationship. And Im not just saying I like someone else to get you mad/jealous. I really do like her. And Im sorry if you think/thought that but its not true. For right now I think its best if we just are friends. Who knows maybe when were older we could end up together. Its not a guarntee but if we both want it then maybe it could happen. But right now I dont want it. Everything happens for a reason and that just wasnt suppose to happen. I kind of just want to talk to you. But Im not really sure how. I feel like you pretty much hate me now. 

I really like this girl I like now. I feel like we have alot in common. Shes an easy person to talk to and I like that."

I thought I found that but I guess I was wrong. It just sucks cause I like you so much and I have for a while. And its like right when I think I get over you.... I like you again.

"event","The simplest things annoy me now. Some people I could call my bestfriends I can't stand now. I know one person will read this and think its them but it's not trust me. I don't think anyone really understands me. I have this problem well a few people know about it and now it's worse than ever.
    But aside from my pathetic issues I've been pretty good. I like someone but I know I have no chance with them.. ever.
                Peace."

"event","So, last night, I actually went to sleep with Kiki in my arms. (Kiki is a stuffed bear Kaytee made me when I was feeling down.)  This was a first for me, as all I have done so far is to pick her up and hug and hold her when I was feeling down.  The reason for this is I have always had this idea that Kiki was filled with a reserve of love and caring that Kaytee put in her, a store that would one day become depleted if I were to hug her too often.(Yeah, it's a weird idea, but it's one that got stuck in my head) But after careful reconsideration, I have decided that love and caring are infinite, and thus, cannot be depleted.  So, I slept with Kiki snuggled in next to me, and had a damn good sleep, nice and restful.  I have been hugging Kiki more than usual lately, and the reason for this is I have been having a bit of a rough time, nothing that I won't get through, but rough nonetheless.  Why?  Because last year on the 5th of October, I left for England, after four months of living together with Bryce and Jen.  Two weeks later I returned to find everything had changed while I was gone.  
  I met Bryce when I first started to work at Chariot Carriers (Bastards).  We both shared a commen interest in movies, mangas, anime, and comics.  Plus he was weird with a good, slightly twisted sense of humour, and we soon became friends.  Over the next couple months, I started going over to his apartment he shared with his girlfriend, Jen, and his two roomates, and we used to hang out, get high, drunk, play games, watch movies, you know- fun shit.  During this time I started to get to know not only Bryce better, but also his girlfriend, Jen, who also became my friend.  Jen was a weird little woman, with a quick wit and wicked sense of humour, but also this maturity I have not seen in 18 year olds since.  After a while, I began to notice their roomates were not the good people I had first thought them to be.  They regularly screwed Bryce and Jen out of money and fixed it so Bryce would be paying everything with his paycheques, so he was always broke.  Anyway, one day they both asked me if I would like to get an apartment of someplace with them, and I accepted.  So fastforward the month and a half it took to save money and actually screw up the courage to tell my parents I was moving out (bloody nervewracking it was, and away I moved to our little basement suite on Memorial.  I remember the first night I slept there, I had to sleep on my mattress on the floor of the living room, because my room was so filled with boxes, and my bed wasn't set up yet.  Both Bryce and Jen had to keep telling me that it was MY place too, and I could do whatever I liked there.  But once the idea took hold, the sense of freedom was overwhelming.  
  Anyway, over the months that followed, we three did everything together- grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, sharing of secrets, stories, drunken fun, fights, laughter, tears.  And after a while, we became not jsut friends, but family.  Bryce was my little brother, Jen my little sister, and I became a big brother to them both.  No matter what crap life threw at us, we always had each other to lean on, to talk to, to ask advice of.  There wasn't a problem I could not come to either of them, and they would listen and always make me feel better.  They became my family, my confidants, and I loved them both with all my heart, or at least a good portion of it. 
  So, anyway, Jen worked at a ford dealership as a detailer, but she quickly tired of her boss' behavior, and left.  I, meanwhile was tired of Chariot, and was looking for a reason to move on.  Jen responded to an ad in the paper, and I accompanied her when she went down with her resume.  She filled out an application, and so did I.  We both got accepted, and I quit my job at Chariot, and we both moved on to training for a job selling Kirby vacuums for Winalta Enterprises (also bastards).  The first week of the job went well, as all we had to do was go around talking to people, and seeing if they would let us into their homes for a presentation, and then doing the presentation for any interested parties.  It was long days (16 hrs), and a lot of walking, but it was fun.  Got to meet alot of nice people, and I got to talk to alot of new people every day.  Of course, I had to leave after the first week to go to England, and away I went, looking forward to coming home to a new job I enjoyed.  Alas, this was not to be.
  When the two weeks was up, and I returned, exausted but happy for it had been a good, fun trip, I discovered that everything had changed.  When I got in the door at seven' o clock in the afternoon, I was told by Jen that she had left Winalta after an altercation with the boss woman cunt who had called Jen several names in the course of a fight.  Also, Bryce had quit his job at Chariot, and they had both got jobs on the night crew of the Calgary Sun.  In fact, when I got in the door, they were both just getting up as they had to leave at ten'o clock to get to work at eleven.  And that is when I found out what it's like to be completely sideswiped by change.  
  So, there I was, unemployed, as I did not want anything to do with Winalta after what they said to Jen, and on top of that, I never got to see either of them much anymore, as they had to get up around 8:30 to leave for work at ten, then they got back at around 5:30 in the morning.  It was a rough transition.
  So about two weeks after I got back, I had to beg to get my old job back, one I didn't want to go back to, but I couldn't afford to spend weeks looking for a new job, and I had a powerful need to eat.  So I went back to work, which was now Bryce-less, and saw Jen and Bryce for maybe ten minutes each morning as I left for work, then come home to a quiet house as they both slept during the day until around 8:00, and I got to spend maybe and hour or two(if I was lucky) with them.  
  Most of their free time was spent with Chris now, who was the one that got them the jobs at the Sun, so he would come over in the morning to hang out as I left for work, or come over to hang when Bryce and Jen got up in the evening.  They would always have funny anecdotes about work, or after work, or about how they stole the silverware at Humpty's one day at breakfast, each anecdote and funny story stabbing like needles in my heart, because I was no longer a part of the fun and good times, I was now on the outside looking in.  It hurt.  For nearly a month it was like I was living on my own, and seeing the three of them laughing and having a good time just made it worse.  Then came the end.
  One day I awoke in the evening, having had a migraine all day, and I walked into the living room, and Jen was sitting on one of the armchairs , on the phone, Bryce looking grim in the other arm chair, and Jen looks at me and says ""Oh hi, Guess what?  I'm going back to Lacombe.""  Then she goes back to phoning people in Lacombe looking for a place to stay.  Meanwhile it feels like my stomach is being twisted by a cold hand while at the same time feeling like it's just been punched.  Yeah, not the best way to tell someone you're leaving.  It turns out she and Bryce had a really big fight over something a rather, and they had broken up.  Anyways, that night I cried, I cried hard, and the next night I phoned my parents and asked if I could move back in, as I felt I was in a bad situation, and Jen saying she was leaving was the last straw.  They said yes, and we set the move date to two weeks.  Well, Jen didn't move away, and they got back together a week later, but I still felt that I needed to leave, as I had to something to change the circumstances of my life, which I wan't happy with.  So the date came, went, there was crying, and I was back at my parents.  
  But the worst came later, when I was talking to Jen on msn and she informed me that they couldn't meet the rent that month, so they were both going back to Lacombe the week after.  I was shocked and saddened by this news, but it didn't really sink in until the last time I went over to what had once been my home, and I saw all the things packed away into neat little boxes.  That was one of the last times I cried.  Then they left, and I stayed.  The feeling of abandonment was overwhelming, of betrayal, of hurt.  Like I had finally let two people in as far as they could go, and they had up and left me.  I know that's not the case, but it was how I felt.  The heart is not known for being rational.   
  The month after was the hardest, when the city felt empty without them here, every day was grey, the snow and wind most frigid, but even the chilliest wind couldn't hold a candle to the cold I felt inside.  I felt hollowed out and nothing was left except for a gnawing sadness at the bottom of where my stomach once was.  It's hard to describe, but chances are you've been there yourself.  To the place on the other side of tears, where you can't even cry, can't even feel anymore, when you've lost someone important to you, and all you want is them back.  I got so bad that I went to go see my old psychiatrist, only to find out he was leaving in a few weeks to Ireland to start a new practice.  On the bus ride back, I felt completely exausted both physically and mentally, because I had hoped I would feel better after going to see him, as if one visit was all that was needed to cure me of my depression.  Having found out different, that one last bit of hope had been ripped away, the one thing that was keeping me going.  And without I felt like my entire body was made of lead, and I had no energy left, no hope, nothing.  I was pretty much dead inside.  
  Eventually, the feelings of hurt lessened as the days, weeks, months went by, and the last time I cried was about two months after they left.  I was in the shower and I started to think about it, and it was like the floodgates were opened; I cried so hard my abs hurt for a week after.  
  It's funny, I used to never feel my age, like when I was twenty one I was always waiting to feel my age, I always felt I was younger than what I was, but now I feel older.  I guess that means I finally grew up. 
  It's been a year since I last let anyone get close to me, as it makes me very uncomfortable to have anyone close, and sharing feeling and inner thoughts makes my stomach go in knots and my body to start shaking badly. I keep everyone at arms length now, but I am trying to change this, even though I don't know if I can, and this entry and journal are my first efforts to change things in that regard.   It's actaully pretty scary, so if I should choose to let you in, please don't betray my trust, as I feel I don't have much left.
  Anyway, thanks for reading, I feel better now I've gotten it out.  And remember-  there is no goodbye, Chunky Rice."

"event","When I was a teen, say about 14 or 15(I don't remember which), I was doing my high school through correspondence, at home.  Of course, this meant little to no actual human interaction, as I did not have a wealth of friends, so much of my time was watching people from afar, and wishing that I could go and talk to them.  Of course, I was painfully shy and not at all sure of myself, so meeting new people pretty much never happened.  So, I was out for a walk to the library one day, and I remember looking up and wishing I could go out into the crowd of people somewhere where there was a crowd of people, and just be around people, surrounded by them, hear them talk, watch them as they went about their lives, and just be around them.  I wished for that as hard as I could, but alas, as with many other wishes, it did not come true, as I did not venture downtown, and just kept to the community of Pineridge pretty much all the time.  And even as I was wishing for it, I realized that it wouldn't be enough.  What I really wanted was to interact with them, talk to them, each and every one of them, and find out what each one was like, what their lives were like, and hear the stories they had to tell.  I wanted not to be lonely anymore.  See, I have this theory that the city is in fact, the lonliest of all places, not because a lack of people, but in fact, because there are so many people, walking, talking, laughing, arguing.  You look around and realize that in this seemingly endless sea of people, that there is not one person you could talk to who would actaully listen and give a crap.  It's a sea of strangers, each one only briefly brushing against another person and then going on with their day or night.  And oddly enough that is comforting, the fact that even if you feel alone, you can go downtown and take a walk in the crowds, and be with people who are just another strange face to every one else in a sea of strange faces (if that even made sense).  You know- alone together time.  And to this day, I still want to go into the crowds and meet everyone, know everyone, and although that is not possible, I will always dream of one day being able to do that."

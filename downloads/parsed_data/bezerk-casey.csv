jake was hit by a drunk driver and lost his life. he passed away in intensive care december 24th at 10.42pm.

how can i go on?. the person i was meant to be with forever has gone.

im a dead soul in a living body.

i regret i never told him everything he meant to me.

and people who have loved ones now, i beg you, just tell them all. life works in funny ways. i found out the hard way.

jake, i love you, where ever you are."

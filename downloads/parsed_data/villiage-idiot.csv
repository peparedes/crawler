"event","I have been somewhat behind in my TV viewing this year.  Even though we are supposed to be preparing for baby, I find my self either really busy or really tired.  Neither of which is conducive to productivity at home.  Here are some of the shows I'm distracting myself with.

<b>Chuck</b> - I've really enjoyed this season thus far... up until the last 2 minutes of the last episode.  Well, I should say last week's episode since I haven't watched last night's episode yet.  When Chuck was walking down the hall with his white dinner jacket and rose, I said aloud, ""I hope Bryce isn't going to be in her room"".  Well, spank my ass and call me Judy, there he was.  I shouldn't be able to call TV shows like that.  If they're going for the big reveal, maybe they should think a little harder before going with the obvious every time.  

<b>Life</b> - I'm worried that this show is on its last legs.  They've banished it to Friday night, so it doesn't stand much of a chance at this point.  The makeup artist on the show should really watch some of it before designing for the next episode.  Maybe its the hallmark of HD, but the makeup was horribly noticeable on this last episode - especially on the male characters.  The female characters were better, but I still have to wonder about how ladies can look so polished while supposedly working out.  I thought sweating was more than just glowing.  At least whenever I've been to the gym... yeah whatever.

<b>Pushing Daisies</b> - The only show we watch without HD, thanks to Dish Network who have decided that ABC does not need to be in HD.  The CW isn't in HD either, but we don't watch much on that.  We did watch Reaper last season, so I need to make sure I'm not missing it.  Anyway, we've both thoroughly enjoyed the season thus far.  I hope the show continues to do well.

<b>True Blood</b> - Probably going to cancel HBO sometime soon.  We like the show thus far, but can't justify the price when we could just wait for a while and get the whole season on Netflix.  The accents are a bit uneven and I haven't quite figured out what they're going for here.  I haven't watched the creator's other show, ""Six Feet Under"" yet.  Maybe if I was familiar with that show, I'd appreciate this one more...?

We have <b>Sanctuary</b> recorded, but we haven't watched any of it yet.  Any thoughts on this one?"

"event","So, it's been a week since I've last updated this journal - something that I was attempting to do a whole lot more often.  

Anyway, we've had a somewhat productive week.  We finished moving the sprinkler heads and loading 6 truck fulls of gravel into the newly created rock bed.  It looks nice.  It needs some decoration in the form of tiki torches, solar lights, other big rocks - maybe in the form of a bench, and possibly some succulents or palms.  Not sure about the palms since we do tend to get rather chilly during the winter around here.  There is a store here called ""Cold Palms"" that is supposed to sell cold hardy palm trees that are proven to survive the winters here.  Our winters are not severe in any shape or form, but probably too cold for your average palm.

On cat news, we took all 5 of them into the vet for their annual checkup.  I really need to find another vet.  It was over $700 for the visit.  One of the reasons we went early (the annual was due in November) is that there is a phantom pee-er in the group.  Someone has been peeing all over the back hallway.  We thoroughly cleaned the hallway with the steam cleaner just to be hit the next day with a fresh puddle.  Turns out that Oscar does in fact have some sort of urinary infection - so we have to tackle him twice a day to give him anti-biotics.  Fun.  He decided to pee all over the pet carrier (and his sister, Annie) on the way home from the vet.  So, I had to further traumatize him by trying to give him a bath.  The bath was unsuccessful, but the tramatization was stunningly triumphant.

Another item on the original to-do list was buy a hot-tub.  Well, we did just that the other day.  I swear, tent sales will be the death of me.  We bought a Honda Odyssey at a tent sale last month - now we bought a hot tub at another tent sale.  It's a nice enough one.  Not as large as I would have liked, but 95% of the time it will be just Susie and I.

Susie has made a master to-do list that we have hung on the refrigerator.  Her goal is to work on at least one of the items on that list every day.  Tonight will be steam cleaning the hallway (again) along with the living room because before we caught Oscar, he had walked around the living room with sodden paws for a while.  I don't want the other kitties getting any ideas about peeing, so we'll take out all the furniture and steam clean tonight.  When the carpet is dry, we're going to try out my sister's rug.  We've spent so much time cleaning that thing, if it still smells tomorrow, it's going to the curb.

Someday, I'll have to post from home so I can upload some pictures of the various projects in progress at the French abode."

"event","So close on the rock project.  I had a little melt down this weekend while I was trying to move a sprinkler head out of the rock ""area"".  The drought has made the ground so hard it is almost impossible to dig.  And digging was required to move the sprinkler.  After almost an hour, I had the first sprinkler head dug up.  Another hour and I had the new location dug.  Not fun.  I still have to move another sprinkler before this is all over with.

I need to dig a TRENCH in this impossible soil to run power from the house out to the proposed hot-tub location.  I don't know how I'm going to do that.  I can't rent a trenching machine because the trench is going really near my septic tank.  I can't risk hitting it or one of the pipes with the trencher.  I'm hoping for some rain.  Hoping is all it is since there is no rain in the forecast.

Which leads me to believe that the grass seed I spread last Friday will be dead soon if it isn't already.  

Susie and I celebrated our 2nd anniversary yesterday by going to work all day and going to chorus rehearsal right after.  I was in favor of us playing hookie for the day, but her work ethic won out.  I would like to think I have a work ethic, but lately I wonder.  I'm all about calling in sick or staying home.  Just think - I only have to do this job for another 30 more years or so.  That's just depressing.  By the time I'll have enough money to retire, I'll be too old to really enjoy it all.  I'll have the time to finally hike the AT, but I'll probably be too feeble to attempt it.  I can't see my dad trying the AT at his age.  Ick.  There has to be a better way.  It probably consists of not whining and just accept where I am.

So, with the new bishop installed - I wonder if he is going to put the call out for new deacons. 

Tonight ( I hope ) will be the conclusion of the rock moving.  We need 2-3 more truck loads of gravel to finish out the project.  We're going to pick up 2 loads worth tonight ( with the help of the in-law's truck ) and I'm going to move that last sprinkler.  I may not be able to move tomorrow, but it will be worth it if we finish!"

"event","So, it's the weekend already.  I sort of spread grass seed and fertilizer on the front lawn this morning before work.  I don't know where the extra energy came from, but I try not to question these things too much.  I say ""sort of"" because I didn't have a proper seed broadcasting device.  My broadcaster is still living with the in-laws, so I used a small hand-held one I had in the shed.  Amazing what you find back there.  

The other option for the weekend is to take a small trip.  The next 3-4 weekends are booked with church or concerts, so this would be the time to go if we didn't have so much work to do at home.  We thought a trip would be nice, but we don't know where to go and we really can't afford too much anyway.  We've spend way too much money lately.

BTW.  It will be our 2 year anniversay on Monday.

Between rehearsals and such, we haven't gotten too much done on the ol' stone project.  I think we're going to drop of the van (we got a new van two weeks ago) to get it iPod-able.  Then head to Across The Pond to get more rocks to finish out the wall.  

On another unrelated topic, I find it rather amusing that there is so much graffiti on in the bathroom stalls here.  Rather profane stuff, actually.  Normally this wouldn't amount to much, but this is a secure facility.  Everyone in the building holds a security clearance and yet, we have high-school level graffiti in the bathrooms.  Strange."

"event","As the title sounds, I spent yesterday in Birmingham for the Installation of our new Bishop.  It was kewl.  There were over 100 priests, probably 30 bishops, even a cardinal.  Odd to see such Catholic activity this far south.  I assume they're all getting behind the new bishop because they know how hard of a time he's going to have it down here.

While the music was great (I was in one of the choirs), we didn't make it onto EWTN.  The bulk of our singing occurred before the service.  Out of the two pieces we did during the service, my TiVo only caught one of them because the service ran long and TiVo didn't compensate.  Ah well.  Nothing to show my boss to prove that I wasn't just dicking around for the day.

I have bell rehearsal tonight, so there will probably not be any progress on the dreaded list of chores.  Thursday is community chorus rehearsal, so again... no progress.  Maybe this weekend we will make some headway."

"event","On my list of projects is the ominous one to finish the rock wall around the pool.  I think it was in early May that we bought two pallets of rocks (3 feet long each) to make a rock garden all around the pool.  We were getting tired of grass clippings flooding the pool every time we cut the grass.   This seemed (at the time) a reasonably simple effort.  Cut the sod, install rocks, back fill with gravel, and decorate.  Simple?

So, that was back in May.  We cut the sod out and installed one rock.  One.  Then ""42nd Street"" hit.  We were so worn out by all the dancing and late nights, we didn't touch the rocks again with any fervor until this past Saturday.  We started after lunch Saturday afternoon and continued after church yesterday.  We have both pallets installed with only a half-dozen or so left to buy to finish the installation part.  Next comes the re-grading of the space between the pool deck and the rock wall.  Then weed paper, followed by a shit-ton of gravel.  Maybe we'll have this project finished by next summer.

Moving the rocks had to happen before calling the concrete guy to install the pad for our new hot-tub (which has yet to be purchased).  I think I need to at least know exactly which hot-tub we're buying before we have the pad poured in order to get the dimensions right.

Other fun events this weekend included a chamber chorus rehearsal Saturday morning, steam-cleaning the back hallway where one of the cats has decided to pee repeatedly, and steam-cleaning my sister's stinky rug.  For the 4th time.  If this doesn't get the smell out - it's going on the curb. 

The project list probably won't get any love this week.  We're driving down to b'ham tonight for the Bishop's installation Mass tomorrow and dress rehearsal tonight.  Wednesday is bell rehearsal followed by bbq potato.  Thursday will be the first night back to the project list.  We have a ""slight"" chance of rain on Thursday, so maybe I should fertilize and over-seed the front yard.  Over-seed may be a bit of an exaggeration since the term assumes some grass coverage in place in which to over-seed.  Our front yard is completely dead, so this will be more like ""seeding"", I guess.  My in-laws have my broadcast spreader, so I may have to go buy a better one :)

This week at work is another week filled with just about nothing.  Getting the cockpit up and running again after months of down-time and architectural changes is about all we have to look forward to.  Yip-ee."

"event","Last night was entirely consumed by driving back and forth to Birmingham.  The rehearsal went pretty well.  I don't know what I am expecting out of this choir exactly, but I always seem to be a bit disappointed in it.  It is just a group of non-auditioned people from various churches in the area that are getting together to sing.  Not all super-star choir singers, but people willing to put in the effort to do some more challenging music than what would be the normal week-to-week fare in most of the churches.  Maybe I'm just spoiled.  Singing with the main HCCA is fun, but it isn't what I really enjoy.  Luckily they have started a chamber choir that is right up my alley.  We're only doing a couple of pieces a concert, but it is challenging music with a group of very talented people.  

I guess I just really miss singing with Dr. Sneed.

Anyway - we didn't get back from Birmingham until almost 11, so it was right to bed.  Even the cats were pissed off that we were out for so long.  The fish didn't seem to care."

There is a myriad of things that I would like to accomplish this Summer/Fall and I can't seem to get a handle on any of them.  So, this attempt is going to consist of posting every day to detail how I wasted my evening.  It is going to be boring anyone reading it.  Again, I apologize.

So, my list of things I need to work on are (in no particular order):

1.  Dig trench for electrical work in back yard.
2.  Finish installing rocks around pool.
3.  Schedule concrete work for hot-tub.  (after rocks)
4.  Buy hot-tub.
5.  Run electrical under house, from breaker box into temporary location.
6.  Built-in cabinets in bedroom.  Build them first, then install them.
7.  Clean my sister's stinky rug.  If not, throw it away.
8.  Organize garage (will help with #6)
9.  Rebuild rotting columns on the front of the house.
10. Build refrig. platform for a friend of mine.
11. Refinish buffet into entertainment center.
12. Build new fish-tank hood.
13. Setup vivarium (?)

So, with this list of items, I should be able to work on any one of them in the evenings...

<b>Monday</b> - Chorus rehearsal.  Bed.
<b>Tuesday</b> - Should have been prime working day.  Goofed off.  I don't remember why I didn't get anything done.
<b>Wednesday</b> - Bell rehearsal.  Potato.  New shows on NBC (Bionic Woman/Life).  Neck hurt, so I didn't do too much.

Tonight we have to drive to B'ham for a rehearsal.  The diocese of Birmingham finally got a new Bishop.  Our old one retired almost 5 years ago.  Susie and I are singing at his installation ceremony.  We'll be part of just one of 5 different choirs.  Should be interesting if nothing else.

Maybe I can look back on this journal to see where my time went.  Or I can just admit that I can't get anything done.  Ever."

It's 58 degrees in here today.  The problem has been identified as the breakdown in the water heater.  Apparently to efficiently cool down a building, you first chill the incoming air down to ~40 degrees then warm it back up with hot water.  Since there are no thermostats controlling when to turn the system on and off, the whole thing runs full out.  All the time.  Even if the hot water is off.  My nipples hurt.

It's over 100 again today (with the heat index).  No rain in sight.  Huntsville Water has not issued any advisories.

My voice thus far has been behaving, even though it tried to give out on me yesterday.  I made the mistake of sprinting back to the dressing rooms at one point to get a hat that I had forgotten to pre-set.

"event","So I had finally decided to buy a Dell.  It came down to having built various versions of the same computer three or four times without any success.  I ordered the Dell on Thursday afternoon.  Dell said they expected to ship my new computer out on the 17th - almost two weeks away.  Saturday morning, the office was driving me crazy.  There were computer parts everywhere and probably several unpaid bills lie hidden under the rubble.  In an attempt to have all the computer parts in one place, I put together another computer.  Not really in an attempt to make it all work, but rather a singular focus of my hatred.  I had fully planned on pulling an ""Office Space"" on that mo-fo.  Well, of course - when it was all built... it worked.  Perfectly.  The thing just came up like nothing was ever wrong.  The only thing that didn't respond quite right was the Nero software that was griping that I had replaced the DVD/RW drive.  I guess I need to buy some new Nero software.  So... after letting the thing run all weekend I had decided to cancel the order with Dell when I got to work Monday morning.  I figured I had plenty of time.  Wrong again.  The damn thing was waiting for me when I got home.  The thing that really chaps my hide is that I <i>KNOW</i> that if I had really been anticipating the new computer - it wouldn't have shipped until the afore promised 17th.  Now that I don't really want the computer - it shows up the next day.

So, I'm left with a quandary.  I think my current computer's behavior is somewhat linked to the fact that its replacement is sitting right next to it.  I have a feeling that if I ship the Dell back, my computer will go belly up yet again.  If I keep it I either have two computers (why) or a Dell that is somewhat inferior (except in reliability) to my previous one.  If I assume the second scenario, to whom would I bestow the old beast?

Any suggestions?

On ""42nd Street"" news... I just really don't like playing Billy.  He's the horn dog which could be fun to play - but it just isn't.  I'm uncomfortable which is making my acting (if you can call it such) suck.  I'm also tired all the damn time which isn't helping the singing or the dancing either.  Crapola.  I'm sure the show will come together as it always does, but I'm really hating the journey.

"event","Susie made an interesting comment recently to our respective effectiveness in our given careers.

""It's odd that we have a computer guy and a PT living in a house that has a habitually broken computer and someone with a messed up neck"".

I don't know if those were her exact words, but they are close... which leads to some explanation:

1.  My home computer is dead.
2.  My neck is all f*d up.

I woke up Friday morning to the horrid sensation of my head being ripped from my body.  Well, it was just my neck telling me that something is not right.  Again.  My recurring neck troubles seem to have reared its ugly head... or neck.  Anyway, it hurts.  A lot.  And I have to tap in 42nd Street.  Not a good combination.  

The computer thingy is also confusing to me.  For no reason that I can come up with, it just stopped responding to the power button.  You could press that little sucker all you wanted with no results.  Then a couple of days later... it would come on.  For a while.  Then just shut off and not respond again for a day or so.  So, one (or more) of three items could have gone bad - the case supplying the switch, the power supply or the motherboard.  I replaced all three.  The first attempt failed because of a badly worded marketing statement causing me to think that some of the components would work together when in fact, they don't.  The second attempt failed along the same lines - this time the new components just didn't work together.  I don't know why.  The third attempt must have shorted something because there we a strange buzzing sound... then nothing.  I'm shipping everything back to the respective retailers and giving up.  I think I'm buying a Dell.  Or some other mass-market PC.  I feel like I've been defeated.

This week - 42nd Street rehearsals continue.  Dad comes to visit for one day.  The day with the 42nd Street rehearsal.  A day off (sort of).  More 42nd Street rehearsals.  I'm ready for this show to be over already.

"event","I just watched ""Before Sunrise"" last night and I'm strangely moved by the series.  I had watched ""Before Sunset"" a couple of months ago and watching the first one really brought things together.  It's not so much that the conversations were especially poignant or even remember-able.  I think just the connection between the characters is unique.  Was the connection contrived by their circumstances or were they really destined to be together?  If they were destined, why did ""fate"" seem to conspire to hinder their reunion in the second movie?  

The second movie leaves things up in the air - which is really the only way to resolve it.  The movie would end quite sadly otherwise as the characters are in a situation that requires sadness - no matter what decision is reached.

I'm not that much of a romantic (or maybe I am) so my seeming obsession with this movie strikes me as odd.  I really want to know what happens in the next installment.  I assume no movie would be made, but it would be nice to read a screenplay or at least a treatment of what Richard Linklater intends for the characters.

Alas, that will probably never come to pass.

On to other news... I have to learn how to tap.  Soon.  My character in 42nd street apparently has a big tap solo in ""We're in the Money"".  I can do all the moves thus far as well as the timing of the steps and transitions.  The problem is that the song is wicked fast.  I don't have any idea how I'm going to be able to produce the right sounds that fast.  I'm having to adopt the philosophy of ""do my best"".  I'll do my best with the high notes and the tap and the directors will have to decide what to do with it.

While I'm AD of 42nd Street, I also was bullied into auditioning.  I wanted the part of Julian Marsh (the producer of the show) so I wasn't too upset that no one had come out for that part.  As of the first weekend, the part was mine.

Enter call-backs.  Since we had such a lousy turn out for the first weekend, we called up some more people to come out and audition the second weekend.  Wouldn't you know it... a Julian walked in.  He's a great singer - the same guy that I considered giving the Carmina part to when I was freaking out about it.  He's a good actor as well and will do a great job with the part.

The problem is... the rest of the casting crew wants me to be Billy.  The TENOR.  I'm not a tenor, dammit.  I liked the part of Julian because he was not a tenor.  I don't know where people keep getting the idea that I'm a tenor.  Range wise, I'm not even a decent baritone.  I'm a bass.  Baso profundo, if you will.  The lighter quality to my voice I guess makes people think tenor, but my glaring lack of upper range should be a clue to them.  Aargh.  I, of course, caved and agreed to do the part.  We'll have to do some doctoring of the part for me to sing it, but it's their call.  I'll do my best with the part I've been given.  I was just looking forward to not having to worry about the high notes.

Projects this weekend:  

Install bamboo flooring in the in-law's house.  (with the wrong tools)
Build swing set for Robert.
Open pool.

My inner thighs are screaming at me.  So much so that sitting and walking are quite uncomfortable.  I hope it's not just ""age"".  I shouldn't be feeling this old yet.  I'm hoping that it is just the fact that I have a sedentary job and I'm just not used to that much movement.  

It seems that we have lost Spring and we've gone straight into Summer - as per usual.  The air-conditioning has gone out on my truck (again).  Last time, they just put more coolant in it.  This time, they have to track down a leak.  Sounds like an expensive proposition.  I'm just not in a place where I can live without A/C.  By ""place"" I mean geographically and mentally.  I'm not even looking forward to driving to the shop today at lunch because of the heat.  More so because my ride back from the shop is Robert who has been driving not only without his A/C but also with his front windows locked in the up position.  The boy needs a new vehicle.  

The Carmina performances went well.  They seemed to be well received - even considering that everyone that I know came to hear me so they might be oddly prejudiced.  The one guy that doesn't know me all that well just said, ""I couldn't have done better myself.""  I'm taking that as a compliment.  The Florence concert was harder for the chorus, it seemed.  The acoustics weren't very nice to anyone except the percussion players.  First Baptist was much better.  I'm pretty sure that UAH will not be able to perform there again though.  There were a couple ""elders"" in the audience reading the translation with wide eyes.  I think they assumed that because most of it was in Latin that it would be sacred.  Ah well.  There is something sacred about drinking songs.

The next big event on the horizon is the Chamber Chorus concert this weekend.  We've not really spent that much time on it, unfortunately.  I would have liked a couple more weeks of preparation, but that ain't gonna happen.  The concert will still be good, but it could have been much better.  I'm hoping that our dress rehearsal Saturday morning will tighten up a lot of the rough spots.  I'd like to sing in mixed formation, but we haven't been rehearsing that way and some people get freaked out when moved around.

The next big outdoor project will entail renting a sod cutter to remove about 3 feet of grass around the pool deck.  Every time I cut the grass, most of the cuttings seem to find their way into the pool.  The removal of the grass won't be <i>that</i> big of a deal.  The placement of a block wall around the pool to keep said clippings out will be the task of the summer.  By the end, we hope to have the area filled in with pea-gravel (or the like) and some hearty plantings.  Along with the solar powered lights we found at Costco, it should be another step in the perfect back-yard oasis.  The hot-tub/pergola will be for the fall, I think.

"event","Well, the first concert of Carmina was last night.  I think it went pretty well.  My family was very excited about the performance, but I think they kinda have to be.  Maybe I did do that good, but I'll always be my biggest critic and my biggest enemy.

Other than a minor phlegm episode during a sustained high note, I don't think there were any glaring errors.  I even started out #11 with the right words, Josh.  

""42nd Street"" auditions were abysmal.  We need around 30 to produce the show.  We had 27 show up for auditions.  Total.  We had to disqualify 3 of them because of age.  There is a 16 year old age limitation that apparently two people decided to ignore.  It wasn't like the ""close"" ones that we had talked to.  We'd decided that if the applicant was to be 16 by the time the show opened, it would be ok.  The two 14 year old's that came, we just couldn't cast.  We need them desperately, but how many other 14 year old's didn't audition because they knew the age limitation.

We do have a few more folks coming to audition this weekend, which is officially only for callbacks.  We've had to extend an invitation to some folks in order to cast the show.  We're going to end up with the whole tech staff in costume by the time the show opens.  If everyone we cast accepts and doesn't drop out, we can do the show with the ones that showed up.  We still need a couple of character parts, but I think we can work with it.

Callbacks on Saturday, after a dress rehearsal for Carmina.  Then the concert on Sunday afternoon.  I was so relieved after I sat down following my last solo bit.  All the anxiety just melted away.  I'm sure it will build up again, but at least I have a couple of days to not think about it.

I'm in a quandary.  The Carmina Burana concert is coming up.  And soon.  I've been practicing as much as I can ( which isn't that much at all ).  To sum up - I'm scared.  Which is why I'm scared.  Stupid spiral effect.  If I'm scared when I try to perform, I'll suck.  Which makes me scared.  There are a couple of parts in the piece that I <i>can</i> do but I haven't been able to do it consistently in rehearsals.  I strain or squeak.  There are times when it comes out just right, but then the next time through, I goof it up.  In concert, I'll have to do that same part three times in a row.  There is someone who I know that can do the part better than me.  I think he's available for the performances.  He would probably do it if I asked him to.  He wouldn't even have to split up the parts with the tenor like I'm doing.  Is it prideful to take the part to myself because it's a challenge and everyone says I would be good?  Or is it wrong to punt and try to give the part away?  

If I look at it in one way, I've been given a challenge.  I've been asked to use my talents ( however meager they may be ).  I should have faith enough that God has given me the strength and the vocal talent to pull this off.  

On the other hand, maybe God is showing me my limitations.  Showing me where I should be humble.  I'm afraid if I go forward with this, I will be shown my limitations in the worst way possible - cracking on stage or just a horrible performance.  That would not only be bad for me but for the kids at UAH and UNA that are performing with me.

Alas, there is no easy answer.  There never is.

"event","So, I probably should be keeping tally of my weight whilst I'm on this ""diet"".  I know, I shouldn't call it a diet, but that's what it is.  It should be a life-long eating behavior change, but I'm just too reliant on food.  Some people have alcohol, some have tobacco or pot.  I have food.  It's my only vice (well...maybe).  

I'm not keeping as close a track as I was in the beginning on calories.  Going out of town for two weddings and a business trip didn't help matters.  I just don't know how to count calories on food that is not from a national chain where I can just get the nutritional information online somewhere.  So, besides the wedding days, I did ok during the trips.  Probably nowhere near my 1500 calorie original limit, but better than I normally would have done.  Lately I know I've been keeping to less than 2000 a day.  I should (?) still lose some weight with that plan, just not too sure on how much.

So, at the beginning of the month, my sister got married.  They got married in my now brother-in-law's parent's house.  Yes, it is that big.  Actually, there were only about 20 or so people at the wedding, but the house was still enormous.  Her wedding also brought into the family a couple of step-inlaw-nieces and a step-inlaw-nephew.  They range in age from 15 down to 9.  Kathy's going to have her hands busy.  I guess the sad part for me (and it is all about me, right?) is that I feel I've really lost a sister rather than gain a step-inlaw family.  She won't be coming over for Christmas anymore.  If I want to see her, I'm going to have to make the journey.  I guess that is just the price you pay for living in different parts of the country.  

The other wedding was Susie's cousin from Nebraska.  We loaded into the trusty Accord and made the 14+ hour treck to Lincoln Nebraska for the rehearsal/wedding/festivities.  Much fun was had by all.  Apparently, that family is a drinking family.  Much booze was had.  I followed the wedding up with a drive over to Cedar Rapids for a meeting, then it was the 12 hour drive back by myself.  That drive didn't help the diet much.  We don't have a Steak-n-shake down here and it's a good thing.  Damn, but they're tasty.

Susie and I are starting to look at vehicles again.  Neither of our vehicles will easily fit a car-seat, so if we start a family, we're going to need a new car.  We should have traded in the Accord and kept Simba when we bought the mini-truck, but she really liked the Accord and Simba didn't do soo well with the gas mileage.  I think we traded Simba back when gas first hit $3.00.  It was costing well over $75 to fill up.  Now with a bill less than $30, I'm pretty happy.  I do miss Simba though.  It would have been a whole lot nicer on the long drives.  The mildly ironic part is that most of the cars we've looked at lately won't be that good on gas mileage anyway.

On a more musical note... This weekend, I'm singing in the chorus (of course) for Huntsville Chamber Music Guild's concert presentation of Lucia.  Should be fun, but we're rehearsing every damn day this week for it.  Next week is Community Chorus' Sacred Spaces concert.  This is probably my favorite concert I've done with HCCA.  Some of the music is probably beyond what we ""should"" be doing talent-wise, but it is such great music.  I'm also involved with HCCA's newly formed Chamber Ensemble.  We'll be doing two well known pieces - Salmo 150 and Ubi Caritas.  Relatively easy, but it should showcase what a smaller group can do.  After that, it's on to holy week where we will be a Mass every night.  Then, 42nd Street auditions - which I still haven't decided if I'm auditioning or not.  Somewhere in the midst of auditions, I'm singing the bass solos for Carmina Burana for UAH and UNA.  This will be the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm too scared to think too much about it, but I will be needing to find time (ha) to practice it with a vocal coach before mid April.  Frick.

Last time I saw him was probably over 10 years ago in Atlanta in a building that no longer exists.  During the song, ""Innocent Man"", he had his percussionist sing the high parts - this time he did it all himself.  Falsetto, of course, but it was certainly ballsy of him to give it a go.

The diet consists of writing down everything that passes my lips.  Calories have a habit of adding up unexpectedly over the course of a day.

Interestingly enough ( or not so much ) I've found it very difficult to hit 1500 calories a day.  My first two days were hard and I still ate ~1700.  This is going to be a long lenten season.  The point (of course) is to change my idea of what food is.  I have an addictive personality when it comes to food, so I could very easily get into trouble the older I get.  My metabolism has certainly slowed since my college days and will no doubt slow even more as I ripen.

I may have to use this journal to keep me honest and to give me a place to vent my frustrations with being hungry all the damn time.  Funny how the mind works like that.

"event","As per usual, my latest adventure into building another home computer has been rife with woes.  First off, the fact that I have to build another computer is a point of contention.  My old computer, Fat Bastard died an untimely death.  It had been making an unholy racket and I thought that cleaning out the years of gack would solve some of the noise issues with the fans.  In the process of removing the processor fan, I inadvertently ripped the processor out of its socket - bending a good number of its pins.  After careful realignment and assembly, the damn thing wouldn't boot, so I have either killed the processor or the motherboard... or both.  Not really wanting to buy another of what I already have, I opted (of course) for upgrading.

The pieces and parts all came in a couple of weeks ago.  After careful assembly - nothing.  The fans spun.  No beep.  No output to the monitor.  Nothing.  Having nothing to swap out as I had upgraded everything, I sent all the questionable parts back to the retailer for them to test and send back the ""operational"" system.  The ""fixed"" parts arrived early this week.  Again, after careful assembly - nothing.  Right back to where I started.  After talking with tech-support, I boxed up everything and sent it back to them.  This time, they will assemble the beast and send it back to me WORKING.  Well, that is the hope anyway.  Maybe I will have a computer at home again in the near future.

Work is going fairly well.  The newness has worn off for the most part and it is work again.  It is still pretty cool, but it there have been days of just wanting to go home.  I guess that is just going to be par for the course.  

A couple of annoyances here:

1.  No cell phones allowed in the building.
2.  No personal items (pictures, music, etc) on the computers
3.  The ""closeness"" - 3 to a cube is a bit much.

Other than that, the job is pretty nice.  I'm basically writing video games for the army.  Nothing as cool as America's Army or anything, but still pretty nice.  It's slow right now for my group, but that will change next week as we get a new slew of requirements to keep us busy.

I'm looking forward to Rome next month.  I can't believe it's that close - I haven't been planning enough for it.  

The weight is back.  Fun.  Why is it that when I'm depressed about gaining weight, I'm the most likely to eat more?  Stupid counter-productive body.

"event","Apparently I can update my LJ here at work.  Well, at least I haven't been fussed at yet for accessing the LJ site.  I have to update via the website instead of using SeMagic though.  I'm not allowed to load any software on government computers, so I guess I'm limited to this tool.  It will probably limit my picture posts, but then again, I don't really post picture posts that often.  I don't even post that often, so there you go.

I am all settled here, finally.  It actually didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would to get all my paperwork in order.  I'm on the network and I have a key to get into the building and the lab, so I guess I have no excuse for lack of productivity.  

So far, the job seems to be quite interesting.  There is certainly the opportunity to learn just about anything I would want to get into here.  The building itself is rather... old... but it does have its charms, I suppose.

As it takes my machine <b>forever</b> to build, and I have to build between each and every little change I make, there is the possibility that I will post more often... ?  We'll see.

"event","Notice is in.  I've been called ""short timer"" and ""ass hole"".  My real boss (as opposed to my project manager who is actually my boss's boss) came by to say that she'd miss me.  Even though I've felt lack-luster about this job, I have enjoyed most of the people I've worked with.  Honestly, I am really scared about this new job.  I have no idea what to expect.  Coming back to Intergraph, I knew exactly what I'd be doing.  It's an industry that I'm familiar with and I knew what would be expected.  SAIC holds a very large unknown.  Robert (one of my groomsmen) loves it, but I don't know if that is enough.  Now knowing what I want out of life is making it difficult to know what I want out of a job.  

There are an abundance of theories out there as to what I'm looking for.  Robert (well, mostly his wife) thinks that I just need kids.  That will solve all my problems.  Or rather make me so worried about them that I won't think about my own wants (or lack of clarity).  My mom and my mother-in-law think that I need to get involved in theatre again.  While I'm not opposed to doing a show again, I don't think that will solve anything.  I was in theatre mostly because I had nothing else to do.  Now that I'm happy in my home life, I don't want to give up that much of my home time for a show.  It would have to be a really good show.  ""42nd Street"" is coming and holds promise.  I'm getting a bit long in the tooth to do that show though.  I'd probably only be random dancer guy (I can tap!), but it sounds like a fun show.  My favorite director is back in town after almost 10 years and is directing again, so there's another plus.  Some people think I need to pursue the PA career.  Others think Nursing is my bag.  Susie is probably more in Robert's camp than I would care to admit.  If only I'd met and married Susie 10 years ago, I would have the time to change careers if I wanted to instead of being up against the ever increasing din of a biological clock.

My going away lunch is going to be on Tuesday of next week... I find that strange.  Everyone will be saying goodbye, but I'll still have the rest of the week before I go.  Strange.  We're going to Edo's - not everyone will be excited about that.  Not everyone likes sushi or other Japanese cuisine.  I suggested going for BBQ since everyone likes that, but my boss likes Edo's as well, so she picked it.  I do wonder how many people won't come because of that though.  I'll have to arrange another BBQ outing on Friday.

"event","So, I have to turn in my 2-week notice today at Intergraph.

I've been going back and forth about this for about two months now.  I had an interview back then with SAIC. They gave me a job offer within hours of the interview.  I turned them down.  The offer wasn't any more money and I was really unsure about leaving Intergraph.  I don't really like it here, but I don't hate it either.  It seemed like a bad idea to leave here after only 7 months of employment.  Shortly after I decided to stay here, one of my work friends who I have known for 12 years decided to quit and move to B'ham.  Ever since then, I've been wondering if I should give SAIC a call back.  I pondered this for a while, then as if in response to my questions, they CALLED ME.  They upped the offer and added a sign on bonus.  Now I have to take the job, I think.  I hate leaving here so soon.  It has been made harder of late because my boss is petting me lately.  I got a ""dinner for two"" bonus recently for my ""outstanding efforts"".  It makes it harder to turn in my notice (I probably won't get the dinner) but I think I should.

The PA thing has hit a snag as well.  To stay on schedule, I need to take an A&P class this coming semester.  UAH and Calhoun are both full.  Nothing available.  There is a class at A&M, but it's during the day and I don't even know if it is available.  If I'm on base all day with a brand new job, I don't think I'll be able to leave for a couple of hours every day.  Crapola.  Now it looks like either the PA thing is not going to happen or I need to take a Biology class or something else to stay on the path.

"event","Not so much a revelation maybe.  That is probably too extreme.  

Just a story then.  Friday, I had a bad day.  Really piss rotten day.  Nothing overly horrible happened, but everything that did happen hit me in just that wrong way.  Low self confidence day.  Low coordination day.  Low positive outlook day.  All self inflicted, mind you, but still crappy.  I am officially losing my office next month.  I saw the plans and sure enough - no office for me.  Offices for a couple of folks that I thought would be out in cube land with me, but they are apparently sucking the right dicks or tweaking the right nipples.  Anyway, there was that.  Then it was off to Donnie's Diamond gallery to pick up my mom's Mother's Day present.  No luck.  They had ordered the wrong thing. (it, of course, turned out fine - they over nighted the right one and Donny worked tirelessly to fix it before the big day).  Then it was home to do the lawn.  Everything I touched turned to crap.  The edger kept screwing up.  The string trimmer kept digging into the dirt too much, the lawn mower ran out of gas.  Just a shitty day.  Then, knowing full well that it was too windy to attempt it, I pull the solar cover off the pool and lay it out on the driveway to clean and dry.  Yup.  I'm an idiot.  And of course, I took the wind blowing as a personal affront to me and my ""very important"" task of cleaning the pool cover.  I was in a serious case of the ""why me?"" which lasted until dinner.  Nothing that a good glass of wine (or two) can't put a dent in.

So, the weekend went pretty well after that.  I calmed down (with no small help from my lovely wife) and ended up having a lovely weekend.  Cleaned the house, re-arranged the still dormant shop (aka garage), grilled hot dogs over the fire-pit with Damon and <lj user=""willowesque"">.  My rather extreme case of ""why me?"" still weighed on me though.  Not so much guilt, but just regret in reacting so badly.  It really hit me at Mass Sunday.  Just singing in the choir just like any other weekend Mass.  There was one line in the Mass that resounded with me though.  It's during the consecration of the host when the priest says, ""The night before he was given up to death,<i> a death he freely accepted</i>, He took bread...""  The freely accepted part struck me for some reason.  Fr. Phil didn't emphasize it but it sang out to me and made me feel at peace.  I'm not sure how long it will last, but I will enjoy it whilst it does.

On another good note, I was supposed to be in Tampa all week, but at the last minute Friday, the trip was canceled.  I've also been asked to go on a pre-sales call sometime next week.  It might be a dog and pony show, but at least it is not Tampa.

Other than LJ distractions, I am going to try really hard to stay productive.  I know I say that  lot on this thing, but I truly am happiest at work while I am productive.  My crappiest days are the days that I just sit around and waste time waiting to go home.

Speaking of jobs... I still haven't seen the signs yet.  I've been really praying for some direction, but nothing as of yet. I am going to try to start a class this summer term, but I may have waited too long.  I am currently on hold with University of Phoenix, on line to see if I can take something there.  If any of you know how to read tea leaves or stars or something that will give me some direction, let me know.  Thanks.

"event","It's official.  Intergraph has lied to me.  Or at least pulled a bait and switch.

In my original offer from Intergraph, an office was promised to me.  When I started here, sure enough - I got an office.  Something that I really wanted and I actually enjoy not having to wear my headphones all the time.  Now, however, they are moving me back into a cube.  Dammit.  All in the name of cost savings.  Halsey Wise, our new CEO has decided to rent out half of the Huntsville campus to save money.  He can afford his gargantuan salary, but he can't afford to keep his employees somewhat happy?

It's really becoming a frightening reality that Intergraph is going to start making more money on real estate than on the software it writes.  We are shortly going to be worth more for the land that we are on than the software we are supposed to be known for.  Our division has 4 buildings (more or less).  One is used for federal contracts and has a bunch of security measures that we really can't mess with.  That leaves three buildings in various stages of decay.  The oldest of which is also the largest.  The two newer buildings that remain, while ""newer"" is really misleading here as they over 20 years old and haven't had any capital improvements - ever.  Halsey has decided that his employees would be best served by packing us all into the oldest, crappiest building on campus and renting out the two ""new"" buildings.  He will most likely spend the money to re-fit the rental units and leave us in flickering florescent and peeling paint.  Fucker.

There has to be something wrong with offering me a job with an office, then ganking it away from me 6 months later.  The other concern is that we will be packed into this building like sardines  How we be able to ""grow the business"" as has been promised by Mr. Wise?  There won't be room to hire anybody else.  It seems that I may have jumped from one sinking ship onto a larger, but still doomed vessel.

I traded in the Tahoe last night for a 2001 Nissan Frontier.  In the exchange, I gave up a really nice Tahoe, but I also gave up having a car payment.  The savings account is drained, but I can fill that back up faster now that we're not paying for a car.  The little truck is pretty nice.  I'm hoping to save quite a bit at the gas pump as well.  Simba (the Tahoe's name) was a good truck and I will miss it, but I'm looking forward to new adventures in the yet to be named vehicle.  I'm also looking forward to paying off the second mortgage and finally being ""almost"" debt-free.  Stupid Dave Ramsey.

Of course, I drain the savings at the same time that the bill for our planned Rome trip comes in.  Ouch.

"event","For no apparent reason last night, Oscar and Seamus decided that they were now sworn enemies.  It all started right as I was about to drift off to sleep.  You know, that very elusive drifting state in which you're supremely comfortable, snuggled up and ready for whatever dreams may come.  It was shattered by what sounded like 15 cats breaking into the house by means of a tin roof that I don't even have.  I sprang out of bed (which is really hard on a Tempur-pedic mattress) ready to oust the intruders only to find that Oscar has pinned the much smaller Seamus behind the trash can and is growling something which I can only assume is really foul language at him.  I break it up and try to catch Oscar to calm him down some.  I'm walking around the house with him, but every time he even smells Seamus, he starts growling and howling.  Seamus, meanwhile makes a hasty retreat under the bed.  I finally let them fend for themselves and luckily only have to put up with some minor growling and every cat really tense for the rest of the night.  Of course, my sleep was ruined.  I finally gave up around midnight and took a sleeping pill.  The alarm was way too early.

Now, I'm trying to work through the haze of left over sleep meds.  On a Monday.

I went to UAB this week to talk to the PA program folks about my possible career shift.  Pretty discouraging meeting on the whole.  I have at least 9 classes to take in order to meet the bare requirements.  Thing is, they only accept the top 15% or so of the applicants.  Meeting just the bare requirements probably is not enough.  Another disturbing factor is that the average accepted candidate this past year had 2 years direct patient care medical experience.  Me?  1.5 days of shadowing a PA.  Probably not enough.  So, not only would I have to quit the job for PA school, I would also have to quit at least a year earlier and get some medical experience, most likely volunteer.

I'm meeting with the UAH nursing folks later in the month to talk about that path.  I'm not necessarily giving up, but it is looking a whole lot less likely.  I know that if I give up on this now, 2 years from now I will question my decision and regret it.

On to other matters... I have about a million projects to accomplish this weekend.  Open the pool, insulate the garage attic (which includes renting an insulation blower), cut the sod out of the new flower bed (which includes renting a sod cutter), install the attic fan (which includes building the baffle box in the joists) and planting the rest of the plants we got from the nursery.  Each one of these tasks is a weekend project.  I was going to take Friday off to get a jump start on some of it, but now it looks like it will rain like a bitch Friday night.  Crapola.  Looks like at least the sod cutting will not get done.  I can't imagine anything messier than trying to cut sod out of that bed when the ground is wet.  Ick.

So, back to work.  The work that I'm stuck at.  Forever.

"event","I broke down and ordered DirecTV with the DVR option.  I just had to watch ""The Sopranos"" and ""Big Love"".  I was lying in bed in Tampa, FL watching the re-runs of the season premier and the series premier (respectively)... afterwords, I rolled over and called DirecTV.  I enjoyed both openings so much that I have to spend an unjustifiably large amount of money every single month to satisfy my urges.  Granted, patience would have allowed me to spend the same money as a month's DirecTV service to get the DVD when each series came out, but where's the fun and spontaneity in that?  Speaking of spontaneity... it took the DirecTV installer 5 hours to install my one-dish, one-receiver setup.  And he was sporting an inordinately large amount of butt-crack and his overall aroma spoke of larger amounts yet to be seen.

I have some organism growing on my wrist.  I can't identify it, but I've finally started to put Neosporin on it now that is has grown to the size of a dime.  If it gets to quarter size, it's off to the doc for me.  At least, that is what Susie is telling me.

So... 10 days of Amoxicillin cancels out Seasonale for a total of 24 days.

Onto other news... I worked ""Nickelback"" Saturday night after loading and delivering 3 refrigerators to Salvation Army, cleaning out the attic, and singing at <lj user=""Everest"">'s and <lj user=""daskolos"">'s wedding.  I'm still a tad bit sore and tired.

The wedding was fantastic.   <lj user=""daskolos""> was gorgeous.  Fun was had by all.  It was certainly fun being at a wedding without having to worry about participating in the garter toss.

"event","For some unknown reason, I checked 2 ""Spicy Tuna Roll"" instead of 2 ""Crunchy Shrimp Roll"" and I didn't even notice it until they brought my lunch.  While the spicy tuna roll wasn't bad, exactly, it wasn't really good either.  Also, the spicy portion of said rolls are sitting in my not quite healthy tummy like a bag of bricks.  No doubt they will make their lengthy trip in record time and scorch my anus as a final ""DOUBLE CHECK YOUR SUSHI ORDER"" middle finger to me on the way out.

I really want to watch the Sopranos this Sunday, but I don't have HBO.  I've been thinking about getting it just for the Sopranos, but it seems a little silly.  There's also a show called ""Big Love"" on HBO that I want to catch as well.  Maybe I can get the finances in line... probably not though.

Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way.  I've spent most of this week curled up on the couch or hunched over the toilet.  And I was being so careful not to catch it from Susie.  We were even sleeping on separate sides of the house, dammit.  Ah well.  $35 to Tamiflu later and I'm back at work.  Not really feeling all that great, but I'm back at work anyway.  Mostly because I don't have any sick leave acquired yet.  I have to stay healthy for a couple of years before that happens.

"event","To follow up on the other day's topic...

I went yesterday to Crestwood and observed a total knee replacement.  Much messier than any of the 6 surgeries I witnessed on Tuesday.  Also with a different PA who takes a lot more active role in the surgeries.  He did a lot of the pounding and such as well as when it was time to sew up, he did all the work.  The surgeon put the first stitch in and walked out of the room.  The PA closed up and did all the bandaging.  It was also at Crestwood, which is way different than the Surgery Center.  Just a lot bigger rooms with a whole lot more people.  

So, I dug up my old transcript from Auburn to get a better idea of what I would need to do before October this year.  After looking at it for a while, I'm scared that even if I could pull off all the other things needed for this career change, I don't think I can do it for next school year.  It would have to be for the following year.  I need 2 classes of psychology, 2 classes of biology, 1 or 2 classes of micro-biology, a human physiology class along with an anatomy class (not gross anatomy).  I may even have to make up more statistics classes as well.  I don't think I have enough hours to qualify.  This along with studying for the GRE and somehow maintaining my work and travel schedule up until I quit to move to B'ham.  Probably not possible.  I'll still look into going to the ""talk with the staff"" shindig at UAB sometime in April, but I do feel like I've had the wind knocked out of my sails somewhat.

In another twist, there is a management position available at work.  I haven't applied for it as of yet, but maybe I will just to see.  Maybe some doors will open up and I'll finally find what I'm supposed to be doing with my life... instead of bitching about it's direction, that is.

"event","So, yesterday I didn't go to work.  I went instead to Huntsville Surgery Center to observe 6 surgeries, followed by shadowing a couple of PA's during their office hours.

The question, of course, boils down to - is the risk (effort) worth the reward.  The reward in this case would be minimum 50 hour weeks spent half in surgery and half seeing patients in the office.  Starting salary (after the break for school, of course) would be comparable to what I'm making now (if not a little more) and can go up with more experience.  Everyone works on base salary plus a percentage of what gets billed to (and more importantly, paid by) insurance as a quarterly bonus.  

It's probably a little too early to really list out pros and cons, but it's really hard for my overly analytical mind to abstain from crunching the entire situation into logical blocks.  At this point, while the career seems interesting and (probably most importantly) rewarding, I'm not sure of two things - the exact path from point A to B and the commitment to work factor.  That last part probably needs a little more explanation.  PA's do not have sick leave.  They have vacation (sort of), but no sick leave.  If I wake up in misery, it's my responsibility to find someone to cover for me.  The problem with that is there are no part time PA's.  There's no one to call to cover, so I <b>have</b> to go to work.  On top of that - I'm not sure how things would work out with children and the like.  What if a kid is sick and I need to be home?  Not sure how that would play out.  The two guys I talked to just didn't take sick or personal leave.  They just didn't.  No matter what happened.

I was really going to post more about all this.  I started this entry at 7:20 this morning and now it's after 4 and I have to scoot.

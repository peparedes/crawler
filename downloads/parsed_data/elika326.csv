"event","So! Today my life took a definite upswing. I got two great ""jobs.""

First- There is a 6th grader at Anderson Open who only speaks french and I got an email on my french department listserve that they were seeking a tutor for her, to teach her english and 6th grade curriculum. So, I applied yesterday and I start tomorrow. The only downside is that it's a 7:15-1:30 school so to be there at all I have to go before my classes, which basically means that I have to be there at 7:15 every day. For those of you who know me and how NOT a morning person I am, we'll see how this works. I'm thinking of trying to work out a deal so I don't have to be there every single day. We'll see. 

Second- I hadn't heard anything for a couple days so I assumed that I hadn't gotten in to the play I auditioned for (the third one I've auditioned for this fall) this week. BUT turns out I was wrong. I got an email today. I'm going to be the Speaker in Artistic Types which my friend Sass wrote and my other friend Lisa and he are co-directing. Should be awesome. I haven't been able to be in a play since Laramie at South so this should be kick ass.

I also had my first rehearsal of my own scene for the directing class and it went really well. I was nervous but it turns out that I shouldn't have been. Katie and Sam are gonna be really good to work with. My other classes are going well. I still love my advanced physical acting class and I'm not sore after every one now. It's only the third week but I already feel like I've learned tons.

Journey begins this weekend again and that'll be really good. I was glad to be there last month but my first time was the last summer one and so then I didn't have it for a month. But, it is starting again and I'll be glad. I've really been feeling my two worlds kind of really really seperate and imcomplete lately. I dunno what to do about it. But I'll find a way I think. We'll see.

As for now. I have to be at Anderson at 7:15 tomorrow so I should go get some shut eye, at least I can say that I can come home and go back to sleep afterwards. Yay for that."

Please don't be like me and google them, it ruins it for everyone (and for the record I only do it with the ones I don't know so I can know, I don't google then post as if i'd known all along.) THANKS!!

1-Everday it's the same thing/Another trend has begun/Hey kids, this might be the one/It's a race to be noticed/And it's leaving us numb/Hey kids, we can't be the ones

2-You slip your hands inside my pockets../..you slip your heart into my chest

3-Since then it's been a book you read in reverse/so you understand less as the pages turn/Or a movie so crass/and akwardly cast/that even I could be the star

4-You take my hand just to give it back/no other lover has ever done that

5-i sang your songs/i danced your dance/i gave your friends all a chance/but putting up with them wasn't worth ever having you

6-My windows look into your living room/i spend the afternoon on top of you/.../my windows look into your bathroom/i spend the evening watching you get yourself clean

7-what really hurt me is i broke your heart/baby, you a good girl and i had no right/i really want to make things right

8-you are the bearer of unconditional things/you held your breath/and the door for me/thanks for your patience

9-knew there was somebody somewhere/like me alone in the dark/now i know my dream will live on/i've been waiting so long/nothing's gonna tear us apart/.../in the end i wanna be standing at the beginning with you.

10-But with demons sitting at my side/An angel's come to ask me why/And slowly I give up inside to say/To feel alive, I'd give it all away

11-Light up, light up/As if you have a choice/Even if you cannot hear my voice/I'll be right beside you dear/To think I might not see those eyes/Makes it so hard not to cry/And as we say our long goodbye/I nearly do

12-You stand in the line just to hit a new low/You're faking a smile with the coffee to go/You tell me your life's been way off line/You're falling to pieces everytime/And I don't need no carryin' on

13-I believe in the wonder/I believe I can touch the flame/There's a spell that I'm under/Got to fly, I don't feel no shame

14-Your faith like the pain/Draws me in again/She washes all my wounds for me/The darkness in my veins/I never could explain/And I wonder if you ever see/Will you still believe?

15-Patience is a game,/and every night I say your name,/Hoping that you'll answer/'cause I'm going insane. 

16-One lie tells a thousand stories/the greatest stories that were ever told. 

17-Tell me why you're looking so confused/when I'm the one who didn't know the truth/how could you ever be so cold?/to go behind my back and call my friend/boy you must have gone and bumped your head because you left her number on your phone.

18-But I won't give you up/I won't let you down/And I won't leave you falling/If the moment ever comes

19-Everybody is just a stranger but/That's the danger in going my own way/I guess it's the price I have to pay/Still ""everything happens for a reason""/Is no reason not to ask myself/If I am living it right

20-A song of you/Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines/Other arms reach out to me/Other eyes smile tenderly/Still in the peaceful dreams I see/The road leads back to you

21-Sun's up, it's a little after twelve/make breakfast for myself/leave the work for someone else/people say that it's just a phase/they tell me to act my age/well i am

22-It's not like you didn't know that/I said I love you and I swear I still do/It must have been so bad/Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

23-Have you seen the well-to-do up and down Park Avenue/On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air/High hats and Arrow collars white spats and lots of dollars/Spending every dime for a wonderful time 

More to come...have at it. :)"

"event","I just gave what I feel was a great audition tonight. The director was glad to see me, knows my name, and complimented my contrasting speech saying that it 's a very difficult speech and I did it well. He had me do part of it again with a direction that he wanted to see and then I went on my way. I will say again, it went very well in my mind, I think it's one of the best auditions I've given this year. Then I was talking to Donny and some girl came up to me radiating energy and interuppted saying that she was sorry but she just had to tell someone, she got a callback, he told her in her audition. Well, crap...there goes my weekend. Now those few little words that she said have thrown me completely through a loop ""why didn't he tell me that I get a callback? Granted it's really rare that directors do that in an audition, I think...but still. That pisses me off because now I'll wonder all weekend until monday and if I don't a callback I'm gonna be really upset because, I did my best, I did really well and if I didn't get a callback then, I don't know. I don't know what they want other than not me apparently. I need to calm down, feel like calming me down or reassuring me, call or IM me it would be mucho appreciated-o...much love to all of you."

10:10-arrive at Intro to Linguistics to find out that I didn't really need to come but the professor just forgot to email us and tell us...thanks man...So gigi and I go to Starbucks and then walk to the west bank.
11:15- French history class. Interesting class, gonna be a lot of reading in the near future but it's in english so it should be fine. A lot of people in the class speak french/have been to france.
12:30-my one hour break begins. I find out that there is a mandatory practicum meeting today...crap.
1:25-Intermediate Stage Direction with Stephen Kanee. This is gonna be a really interesting class I think. I think I'm going to really really like it but it's gonna be work and he's gonna be tough on us, good. 
2:30-having been released from class an hour early I check my email to find out when they sent out an email about the practicum meeting (11:38 am. Well if I wouldn't have been in Rarig today then I would never have known about it as I started classes at 10, way to go practicum organizers...) and notice there's an audition reminder. I screamed a little bit right in the middle of rarig. ""Due to unforseen circumstances"" Aleks Wolska isn't going to be directing Midsummer anymore...well there goes my little fleck of hope of getting in because the director knows who I am, I thought (I believe it throughly hurt my chances last fall for laramie that I didn't know bonnie) but then I kept reading and it said Stephen Kanee is going to be taking over. Well that's at least good, he's been retired for several years and is only teaching one class right now (my intermediate stage direction class, and there are only 10 people in that class, only a few of which act as well) so I was a little more cheered up after that though I don't know what he'll be looking for...:( It should be good though, at least it's better than switching to someone I have never met...that would suck.
3:35-Shakespeare:voice and performance. This class is gonna rock. It's gonna be a lot of work but it's gonna rock. Barbara Berlovitz did some warm-up type exercises with us today and at the end i felt sooo much better (we had done w/ text in the beginning and at the end of the exercise, at the end it was just easy to say the text, natural, right, whereas at the beginning it was one more thing to think about in addition to my body which i was making do several other things she had requested) and lemme tell you something else, walk a certain distance (about 20-25 feet), go back and walk it w/ your eyes closed (and have someone at the end to stop you at the same point as the first time) and then run with with your eyes closed (having the person stop you again). It is such a rush, and freeing and...I can't even really describe it. Scary and thrilling and amazing at the same time?? Try it. Trust me.
5:45- Practicum meeting. Thank God I got to leave after 15 mins. If I don't get into the show then I'm gonna have a practicum assignment that I will hate but...hopefully I'll get into the show.
6:00-6:35-U campus to home to Carbone's
6:40-Dinner w/ Jamin, Bree, Grams and the 'rents.
7:26-Took Jamin and Bree to the airport. 
8:33-Writing this. Being exhausted. Thinking about the food that's waiting for me in the kitchen. In fact, I'm gonna go eat that. Back later. Much love!"

""I'm sick/ I'm tired/ I can't sleep 'cause I'm so wired/ I don't know if I can take this/ I don't know how to love you./
Tick/Tock/Inside/Tossing, turning, I feel blind/ Sun is up, rain pours in/ another day another wind
grab it kick it smash it love it lose it yea yea hold it throw it crave it/ searching for my solace...
my eyes red, my tongue is dry, these long nights are never kind..."""

"event","So...I'm thinking about dropping the French Civilization and Culture I class I'm signed up for with the french department for next semester and taking the intermediate directing course instead...Here are pros and cons, tell me what'cha think:

Pros-
-I could take the advanced directing class in the spring if i want to.
-The french course I would be dropping has been described as incredibly easy and an automatic A, so while this might appeal to some I would rather not waste my time.
-One less trek I have to make all the way across campus from Rarig to Folwell if I drop it.
-More theater.

Cons-
-I wouldnt be taking a french class next semester if I dropped it and though I am bilingual now (so says my french family) I still dont like the idea of not having a french class in my schedule
-I might lose some of my french skill not having a regular forum to speak it in...

Grr...I dunno what I want to do...

In other news I will be home in 51 hours and 27 mintues :)

Ugh, I am in one of my moods where every little thing seems incredibly annoying...I have managed not to snap at anyone yet though, so that is definitly a good thing..."

"event","I'm sorry! I totally forgot about this until I read everyone else's new ones...so hear goes...questions from miles...
1) Do you miss the LAN party kids?
     Yes I do. I never get to see you guys anymore...and YES I'm perfectly aware that it is probably completely my fault...perhaps this weekend will break the streak of my absenses.
2) At one point, did you want to date me? (curiosity. Laura brought it up quite some time ago.)
     I don't know. There was a time when I thought that you wanted to date me and I started thinking about wheter I wanted to date you or not but I got distracted by something shiny and I never decided one way or another.
3) What job would you like to have?
     I would love to act, ideally. If I couldn't do that I would like to direct or teach. I also am thinking of some sort of translator job would be fun or maybe I could be a tour guide for all those horrid tourists (they make suprisingly good money)
4) What makes French so appealing to you?
     Their culture and their language is so old and so developed. They've gotten through all the crap that we (as a fairly young and very headstrong/agressive nation) are still trying to figure out and therefore their culture is more distinguised and I like that. I love that they have their values figured out (they won't let work come between them and their family, they have a HEALTHY appreciation of food and diet/exercise, and their history is very important to them)and I've just always had an attraction to their language, when I took spanish I wanted to take french, I just always felt like it was the thing I was supposed to do, plus, it's a language filled with rules but also things that you just have to memorize but I think it's also an easy language because you can easily work around holes in your vocab...now i've written a nove to answer...not good...
5) Whats your favorite movie, other than Shrek and Shrek 2?
     I don't know, there are too many good ones. I really like Sabrina (the one with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart) though."

We spent all day at the house and I went shopping with the girls for a while because hey, I had all day right, my flight didn't leave until after midnight. For some reason it wouldn't let us check in online for our flight but we figured, whatever, screw you technology. Well we quickly figured out why we couldn't check in online, and why it wouldn't let us check ourselves in at the airport either. 12:40am Sunday, May 15...we got there at the end of the day Sunday, May 15 alright, unfortunatly 12:40am at the end of Sunday, May 15 is actually Monday, May 16...we were 24 hours late...THANK GOD they had three seats blocked off which they unblocked for us and booked us for that flight for no extra cost. We had to sit in the back row where we couldn't recline our seats and where I had to listen to the flight attendants gossip and complain and talk about Survivor for 3.5 hours (that pissed me off sooooo much) but at least I got home.

Today we're having our Cinco de Mayo party/family reunion (all of you who are thinking that we're ""a little late"" SHUT UP...sometimes it's hard to get all together on the exact day, gimme a fricking break) I just got done making chocolate covered strawberries and they look gorgeous. Usually I don't like strawberries but i was in the mood for them, I guess. 

I'm off to spend time with the Family now...hit me up next week if you wanna hang out or something, I'll be home on Monday. Much Love!!

P.S. I really wish my profs would put up my final grades...I've been checking a lot, all week..."

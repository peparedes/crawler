"event","I copied this over from a book we're reading in my humanities class. I love my professor because he starts at the beginning. Wendell starts at the beginning too. Read!<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""the hidden wound"">From other stories that have been handed down to me I know that my people, like many others in the slave states, went to church with their slaves, were baptized with them, and presumably expected to associate with them in heaven. Again, I have been years realizing what this means, and what it has cost. <br /> First, consider the moral predicament of the master who sat in church with his slaves, thus attesting his belief in the immortality of the souls of people whose bodies he owned and used. He thus placed his body, if not his mind, at the very crux of the deepest contradiction of his life. How could he presume to own the body of a man whose soul he considered as worthy of salvation as his own? To keep this question from articulating itself in his thoughts and demanding an answer, he had to perfect an empty space in his mind, a silence, between heavenly concerns and earthly concerns, between body and spirit. If there had ever opened a conscious connection between the two claims, if the two sides of his mind had ever touched, it would have been like building a fire in a house full of gunpowder: somewhere down deep in his mind he always knew of the danger, and his nerves were always alert to it. <br /> But also consider this congregation of masters and slaves from the view of the pulpit. How, facing that mixture, and dependent on the white half of it for your livelihood, would you handle such a text as the Sermon on the Mount? It would be very desirable, and very practical, to preach to slaves such imperatives as these:<br /><i><br />..resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br /><br />Love your enemies, belss them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you...<br /><br />Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth...<br /><br />...all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them...<br /><br /></i>But what about the masters? Will they stand to be told such things in the very presence of the most damning evidence against them?<br />    Or could you even acknowledge the existence of such passages as these from the First Epistle of John?<br /><br /><i>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br /><br />But whoso hath this wold's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.<br /><br />If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. <br /><br /></i>Clearly, it would not do. If a man wanted him to remain a preacher he would have to honor that division in the minds of the congregation between earth and heaven, body and soul. His concern obviously had to be with things heavenly; unless he was a saint or a fool he would leave earthly things to the care of those who stood to benefit from them. <br /> Thus the moral obligation was cleanly excerpted from the religion. The question of how best to live on the earth, among one's fellow creatures, was permitted to atrophy, and the churches devoted themselves exclusively and obsessively with the question of salvation. <br /> How do you get to heaven? Well, I have quoted some passages, and there are many others, that say you get there by obeying the moral imperatives of the Scripture, by loving one another ""in deed and in truth."" But the churches, with their strong ties to the pocketbooks of racists, felt obliged to see it another way: the way to heaven was faith; one got there by <i>believing.  </i>And to this day that continues to be the emphasis of such denominations as the Southern Baptist: to be saved, believe! The mystical aspects of Christianity completely overshadow the moral. But it is a bogus mysticism, mysticism as wishful magic, a recipe by which to secure the benefits of eternal bliss without having to give up the benefits of temporal vice: corrupt your soul and save it too! The favorite texts of such churches are John 3:16:<br /><br /><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <br /></i><i><br /></i>and Acts 16:31:<br /><br /><i>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved...<br /><br /></i>I have heard these passages quoted with obsessive reiteration all my life. When the ministers of these churches turned their attention to the world, they did so with the puritanical passion of St. Paul, violently opposing such ""sins"" as drinking, failure to attend church, and ""immorality""--sins of somewhat questionable status in the first place, and which the church found it easy enough both to condemn and to live with, and to the practice of which its condemnation added a little more than certain spice. The great moral tasks of honest and peace and neighborliness and brother hood and the care of the earth have been left to be taken up in the streets by the ""alienated"" youth of the 1960s and 1970s.<br /> Detached from real issues and real evils, the language of religion became abstract, intensely (desperately?) pious, rhetorical, inflated with phony mysticism and joyless passion. The religious institutions became comfort stations for scribes and publicans and pharisees. Far from curing the wound of racism, the white man's Christianity has been it's soothing bandage--a bandage masquerading as Sunday clothes, for the wearing of which one expects a certain moral credit.<br /><br />(<i>The Hidden Wound</i> by Wendall Berry)</div>"

i'm on break at work. it's not very fun. i call people who have purchased tvs with best buy and try to schedule their installation in a timely fashion. you would be suprised how much this upsets people.  

i felt really bad for one of the guys i called today. he bought a dvd player and had to wait so long to get it installed with us that his warrentee ran out. when he got it, he used it once then it broke. best buy wouldn't return it or fix it wihtout charging him. then he bought a sound system that doesn't work. he can't hear people talking on television so he keeps the volume up but if they fire a gun it knocks the pictures off his walls. he went in and the best buy rep sold him a fucking consultation. not an installation. not a service package. a consultation. consultations are for people who need to buy sound systems or flat screen tvs. not for people who already bought these things. i thought he was going to cry when i told him that a consultation wasn't going to help anything. he asked to talk to my supervisor but she was outside smoking.

i wish i didn't have to work on sunday. it's nice to only have to work two days before i get another day off though. i like that.

i was at some holistic camp thing for free spirits. i wanted another massage but i didn't want to pay for it. everyone was pretty nice but they kept a bunch of lobsters in big glass tanks like the ones at wegmans and that made me feel kinda sad. i took a lobster out and was carrying it around in my teeth for a while, scaring the hippie girls with it. the rooftops were really steep and the hippies made us sit up there for some reason. i snuck away and was drinking cranberry juice out of the carton until one of the older healer free spirit hippie ladies scolded me and made me throw away all the juice.

had a fun time at the partay.
did a lot of dancing to little dipper and only hurt myself a little bit.

was in my way. 

i thought it was a wild turkey at first. peacocks are BIG! it was eating things out of my bushes and i said, ""hello turkey"" and it turned it's head and looked at me. i offered it some bread but it was just startled at my tossing things in it's direction. then it walked down the driveway and up the sidewalk. like a dog. or more like a lady on an afternoon stroll. it kept right to the sidewalk. i walked after it for a while--i was very excited. At that point I still thought it might be a turkey. when i told mike, he said that they'd found the peacock near my house. how exciting. female peacocks aren't as pretty. still cool though.

3. mike and jenna do dances.
4. head on over to the peter and russ and david!
5. quality time avec russ and his parrotlet titled 'lil russ.
6. lots of walking to the co op house party, woodland creature themed!
7. seeing ROBYN! it had been so long.
8. more friends and more friends that i hadn't seen in aaaaages.
9. Flying Bison, kegS! plural!
10. and then DANCING. DANCING A LOT. 

it was so wonderful. and then

saturday day/night:
1. sleeping off my hangover. 
2. america's next top model. MARATHON. of my favorite cycle. 
3. Gnocci with sun dried tomatoes and white sauce. delish.
4. mareike and josh!
5. absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary amounts of sparks consumed. 
6. molson 22's which remind me of summer in bidwell park.
7. gab gab gab
8. the mohawk place for Transmission. my favorite dance party.
9. everyone is there. everyone everyone. dancing.
10. mike and i return home. order chicken finger subs and then fall asleep before they arrive. ha.

Here is your horoscope
for Thursday, March 8:

 The Sun, ruler of our ego, is in zodiac harmony with Jupiter, the most generous planet of all. Look to make a big move on the romance front, although someone new may enter the picture with a tempting offer. How many balls can you juggle at once? No pun intended!"

"event","today is monday monday and i'm going to get everything everything done! and man, there is a lot of everything that needs doing. i can't wait to swim on wednesday morning!

i made a booty load of money on saturday night. work almost made me cry but i'm buying myself a new bathing suit and some new paints and canvas today so it was all worthwhile. 

UB is trying it's hardest to screw me over with my science credits. i am going to see my advisor tomorrow. i will not be screwed. i refuse. i will make lots of noise. they'll fix it.

spring break is next week. YES! i can't wait to lie around all day.

the sixth cycle of america's next top model starts wednesday night. two hour premier. i'm psyched. i'm going to dedicate my wednesday nights to this show. i'm paying for cable damnit, i need a SHOW. a SHOW!

mike and i want to get this dog this summer. we've also been talking about getting a place together. having a roommate is cheaper and i hate living with girls.  :)  i like the girl friends i have right now too much to trash the friendships with ""shared"" utilities and ""borrowing"" eachothers stuff, etc. i'm done living with grrls. eff that. it would also be nice for mike to have his stuff in the place he spends most of his time. does it sound contradictory when i say that mike and i want to move in together so that we have more space? probably. i think it's a good idea. we'll see. summer is still almost 3 months away. 

anyway, if we do end up getting a place together (assuming said place is bigger and has a yard) our new bff will look like this:

he's hypo-allergenic. he won't make mom sneeze so when we go home for a weekend or go up to my parents camp we can just bring him. he and bailey can be BFF. i wonder what we'll name him.

(i am still really sad to see the cats go but when i took them their original owner and i both knew that their stay was a sort of trial to see how we all got along. it didn't go well. it sucks to have to admit that and to force myself to make the change that i know will be for the better. fucking cats. if they weren't so cute it wouldn't be a problem. i will miss them. but i won't miss their hair all over my shit. and i won't miss them eating my houseplants. or destroying my furnature. fucking cats.)

there is a bottle of little penguin wine in my apt. right now. oh joy."

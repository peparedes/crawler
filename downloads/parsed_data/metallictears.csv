So my birthday party was fun. Oddly everything was matching. Some people got very annoying *cough*ariel*cough :) 

The fourth was fun..we went downtown with DJ and Laci and rode the octopus and then we got curly fries and sat where the fireworks were supposed to be shown and then they were late starting. Then some houses by it were shooting off fireworks so it was like a pre-show show lol but yeah I bruised my shoulders on the octopus because Laci and I were sliding all around, I can't even touch my right shoulder. 

Ok I think that was enough of an update..maybe I should get better at updating this thing more often.

PS: Emily we need to talk about the palmyra carnival ;)"

"event","So we only have 1 and a half day left and I'm super excited.. AND emily is getting her car fixed and we finally get to go to Quincy by ourselves on Tuesday!!!! :D 

I had quite a busy weekend..

1) On Friday, Emily and I went to Walmart and such, got some matching flip flops. Also had the bathroom changing accident! :P

2) Spent Friday night with Emily, I did her biology homework and her teacher didn't even know the difference. That was hilarious. Then we went to the hot dog thing lol.

3) Saturday night, we had supper over at Laci and DJ's. Also watched 13 going on 30..good movie.

4) Sunday I got to drive a tractor down to Hydesburg Church. Before that I had to mow..got darker, (Like I need anymore! on my arms anway.)

Then Monday was boring..but I've been rather happy all week seeing as it is the last week of school. We watched Tommy Boy in Marketing and took a test. Then in Biology we took the final, which I don't think I did so well on because it was the end of class and I was rushing. Then in Spanish we watch Field of Dreams and it actually WASN'T IN SPANISH THIS TIME!!! shocker I know, but it did have spanish subtitles, but after awhile you just block them out.

Tuesday was realllly boring. I had IBS, but I was in the Patterson because so many people are in IBS they have to have two rooms. Sad really, and who gives IBS on the last week of school anyways? I didn't have anything to work on either so it made it worse. At least I got to go up and finish my final in Geometry. I was actually happy to be up there for once. Then I had to go back down and then I had to come back up and take my English final. I think I actually did pretty good on it. Then for the next 3 hours I was bored out of my mind and half asleep. But I couldn't sleep. Then for lunch we only got to eat for 10 minutes because we were in between shifts, isolated from everyone. Pretty pathedic if you ask me. Megan and I were writing back and forth and playing tic tac toe. 

Well gotta go, bell's about to ring."

"event","wow this weekend was bizzy. Well Friday wasn't, I felt like shit. Then Saturday, Emily and I had some fun. We went to Subway and then we went to Walmart. Then we went to Fashion Bug and Emily had a <u>Miss Congeniality Moment</u> :D Shoe shopping is so stressful these days lol. Then we went to Walmart again and we were looking for Cruel Intentions 2 and we couldn't find it, they had 1 and 3, we didn't even know they had a 3. Then the old man kept following us. Then we got A Perfect Score, and some chips. Then we picked up my sister from her friend's house and talk about hyper we were screaming out the window. Emily came back to my house, and we watched it. Then she went home. Wow, then yesterday, Laci and DJ came down. DJ was wearing my light up flip flops and he was like ""I think I like these"" and I was like <i>wow</i>. I was outside a lot yesterday too and I got really tan. Then today my stomach still felt like somebody was pounding inside with a hammer. So I stayed home. Yeah, so there's my wonderful post, I know you all missed me. :P I don't feel good yet I'm still in a good mood. I <b>love</b> this weather!"

Stability results were moderately low which suggests you are worrying, insecure, emotional, and anxious. 

Orderliness results were low which suggests you are overly flexible, improvised, and fun seeking at the expense too often of reliability, work ethic, and long term accomplishment. 

Extraversion results were medium which suggests you are moderately talkative, outgoing, sociable and interacting. 
 

trait snapshot:

messy, disorganized, not rule conscious, rebellious, rash, weird, ambivalent about chaos, likes bizarre things, anti-authority, not good at saving money, not a perfectionist, leaves many things unfinished, low self control, strange, desires more attention, romantic daydreamer, abstract, impractical, unproductive, leisurely, likes the unknown 


wow the trait snapshot is pretty accurate. :)

OK I got a new keyboard that has like 160 keys on it. The makers definitely had the lazy in mind. It's one of those Web Office Pro ones. Anyways that's all I have to say.

PS: The Map testing is relatively easy, better than I thought it would be at most."

"event","so it's been awhile, but I'm sure none of you missed my lame posts on here. I got my hair done on wednesday night. I got lots of blonde against my will. I told her I wanted brown highlights to make my hair darker. She was like oh you wouldn't look good with brown so she gave me blonde, but she didn't tell me until after she already did it. Plus she didn't give me just a little blonde, she gave me a loooot of blonde. Then I have reddish brown underneath. Oh well it took some getting used to and I think I've adjusted. I've been wearing it up a lot to hide the blonde. :D But most of you who know me already know about this.

Don't have much else to talk about..except just a few little random things I wanna throw in here just to let them out. My cousin's gonna be a daddy again, I gotta B on my Biology test which I'm happy about..and Mrs. Conrad is a BITCH!! ok I'm done.

haha wow my love is one of a kind? didn't know that


hmm so I took the baby home. I got a 98% on it, my mom tipped the head back twice so I got 5 pts. off every time. So all together I missed 10 points, but it was worth 500 so it wasn't as bad as if it had been worth less points.

So the Superbowl..I hope Eagles win :D I hope it's a close game though so it's worth watching.

Well I better go I still have to do my jot outline for english and my geometry homework.

By the way, Rebecca you better be supplying me with some chow tomorrow ;)"

"event","God all day I have been popping cough drops like candy.. I have a cold and all my allergy shit isn't helping.

So anyway I watched Rose Red this weekend. It's freakin 4 and half hours long. But it was really good.

I have a biology test tomorrow, that I didn't study for and I have to take the fucking baby think it over baby home tomorrow, and I have to take it home on Thursday. I wanted it on a weekend so I could actually do my homework through the week but hell no of course not; and what's worse is Summer has to take hers home tomorrow, too. So it's double the joy.

We got our course descriptions for next year. The only 2 classes for my electives I know I'm taking are Art 1, Word Processing (half semester), and PE (half semester), because those are my only required credits I have left, besides my other electives. So I don't have to worry about that when I'm a senior. So I still have to think about 4 other classes I want to take next year. We have to take English 11 and American Studies. They have a new class called Young Adult Literature, but I read the description and you have to give lots of oral presentations..bleh I'll think about it.

Oh yeah we got a new dishwasher finally. Totally unrelated, I have a big Marketing presentation tomorrow. At least my Spanish test isn't until Friday, because then I would have something big in every block tomorrow; that would majorly suck."

Hmm I think that suits me for the most part.

"event","Ok today was the longest day ever. I wish we didn't have block scheduling. I would rather have more, shorter, classes than 4 classes a day that are an hour and a half each, especially Study Hall. It takes forever, and usually I don't have any homework to do in there so it takes even longer.

So last night I watched Catwoman, part of King Arthur, because I was doing my homework when they put it in, and I watched some of Van Helsing. Today I watched The Mothman Prophecies, I didn't really like the ending though.

I'm reading 3 or 4 books at the same time. I'm reading Of Mice and Men for English, Silus Marner (I think that's how you spell it.) for English, that's for extra credit though. I'm also reading The Notebook, I started that before I started any of these others and I'm only on the second chapter still; and I started another book today, I don't remember what it's called. Lots and Lots of READING. 

A word of advice: Don't eat Chex cereal and Juicy Fruit gum at the same time. Very Nasty and it tastes like bologna :D"

I don't have much to write about really. Anything important has came and went already. I got in a major fight with my mom yesterday. It all actually revolved around geometry, well that's what it started out as. Then I was like, ""I don't know why I even live here anymore."" Then my mom said, ""Good, then pack your stuff and leave."" Not surprisingly, I didn't. That's all I remember from the past few weeks really, and only because it was recent.

I don't know why I wrote every different subject in a new paragraph. Probably to take up more space? Yeah, it sounds like something I would do.

Anyways I'm leaving, see ya."

"event","So I changed my colors, if you haven't noticed. I was getting tired of the other colors. I also changed my mood icon. I don't remember the last time I updated. But I'll just tell you what has happened recently. Finals are over. I'm really glad about that. Creative Writing is over, and that was one of my most stressful classes. 

Yes Emily, Friday was fun! :P That lady was rude. I washed my hands when I got home. lol Finally got the smell off. 

Hmm I went to my aunt's yesterday for my cousin's graduation party. He has a master's degree or a bachelor's degree, I don't remember which. But he's going to graduate school, because he still has 3 credits to get. 

I watched Princess Diaries 2 yesterday. I think it's better than the first one, but then again I haven't seen the first one in a while.

"event","Wow it was so hot in Marketing today. It's always really hot or really cold; and it was rather warm today and it was making me sleepy. Then in Creative Writing we had to give our presentations and that was pretty much all we did in there. In biology we had our final which was pretty easy I think. In Spanish we had our listening comprehension final. Part of it was easy but I don't think I did very good on it.

Hmm so yesterday I had geometry, and then in English we had a sub and we were supposed to be studying for our final that we have tomorrow but I was studying for the Government pre-test that was the next block. I memorized the amendments in an hour, and the rest of the time was spent talking. I couldn't believe I memorized those so fast since I have never learned them before. But yeah on the pre-test I didn't miss any of the amendments. But I missed some on the other parts. I got a 76 which was 10% away from not having to take the final. If we got an 86% or above we didn't have to take the final. But yeah I have to take it and at least I know what I missed, but I'll probably miss it again tomorrow. :P

So anyhow I have 2 finals tomorrow and then I'm done thank god, and then we don't have school on Monday! Woo hoo I'm so glad, although I wish we had a  three day weekend every weekend and then just have 4 days a week :D

There's your update on my wonderful day for all you that care :D I'm out.

PS: lol I don't think I've ever done a ""PS"" on this before..anyway there's lightning outside and it's pretty! :D"

wishing everythng would be okay, even though I know it won't

I just let all the anger build up inside me, until I can't take it anymore and let it out in stupid ways.
I'm sick of all this pain and anger that no one understands.
I just want to scream but I can't,
my throat is hoarse from the angry sreaming matches everyday.

I'm breaking down and no one cares.
I have so much pain in my heart, I don't think it will ever heal.
I may be happy on the outside, but the hurt, pain, and anger will always haunt me.

I've grown numb to any feeling
I don't know why I'm here anymore
I'm sick of everyone thinking my life is perfect, like I don't have any problems.
Everyone thinks they know me.

No one knows that my heart bleeds slowly everyday, that I won't have one sooner or later, and I won't have a purpose anymore.

This wasn't for pity, I'm just stating how I feel."

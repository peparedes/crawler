"event","<p>I know, things haven't been very exciting in England, apparently. I blame it on the far fewer amount of travel this term. It doesn't mean I'm not having a fantastic time, it just means it's not so drastically exciting that I feel the need the write about it.<br /><br />If you are in fact interested in what's going on over here, here you are:<br /><br />I have 15 days left in England. Today's the last day of school, and I only have one class. My exams start on Tuesday and end the following Wednesday.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am both incredibly excited and morosely sad that I'm leaving.<br /><br />My biggest problem in life right now is trying to figure out the best way to send my fencing stuff home.&nbsp;<br />Option a) Air Canada. Will cost about $140. Have no idea how will carry. Probably charge for those luggage carts, no? Can't be too much. b) Shipping. Unknown costs. Must transport to post office (additional costs $70).<br />My laziness will probably win this round, and I'll somehow lug it with me to the airport. Thing is, the strap on it broke, and&nbsp;I only have two hands, so one of those cart thingies is supremely necessary, unless I can perfect the art of balancing it on top of my one piece of luggage with wheels.<br /><br />My second biggest problem in life right now is trying to figure out the best way to fit all the rest of my stuff in my two pieces of luggage. I have way too many clothes and books.<br /><br />Third biggest problem in life is staying focussed to study for exams. The&nbsp;aforementioned&nbsp;melancholy mixed with euphoria is incredibly distracting.

Buy a laptop.&nbsp;Buy house things&nbsp;and move in.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps now I&nbsp;will try to find a way to re-attach my fencing strap.&nbsp;<br />Ciao&nbsp;</p>"

Fencing's been going great! i had an early-morning lesson on Wednesday at 10 AM, immediately following my English class, and strangely had loads more endurance than ever... even though breakfast was sparce and I felt like I'd slept too little. The rest of the day I felt energized too, so maybe I'll ask Christian to make this a permanent thing?
I'm improving by leaps and bounds too... Christian's a fabulous coach. We've been friends long enough that I don't have an inferiority complex, and he's so sporting he thinks nothing of superiority. And instead of having just my technique broken down and polished up like with Steve, and then dealing with my head with John, Christian can easily talk about both aspects of fencing, so that I feel very well-rounded. When we do get down and fence, the points I do get he never resents or accounts to luck (as is common with more experienced fencers against less experiences ones) but actually says things like ""Great!"" ""That was perfect!"" ""I didn't see that coming at all!"" so that I've taken to leaping with glee when I do get one, instead of feeling sort of sheepish. 
I got six points against him yesterday (up from 1 :D) and they were all beautiful.

I've got a few things coming up next week. My religions midterm is Tuesday (fortunately my only midterm) I have a presentation for English on Wednesday, and an Art history essay due on Wednesday too (Happy Valentine's Day to me!)

The other more significant factor contributing to stress is money. I calculated that it'll cost me $26,100 just to break even next summer. The rounded-off breakdown is $10,000 owing to OSAP --which I technically don't have to pay back until I graduate, but I'd rather pay back as much as I can so that I don't end up actually living in a box made out of my laminated diploma. I still owe my parents about $5,000, rent next year comes to an estimated $6,000 with furnishing $300 + food, laundry, clothing, and entertainment. Adding tuition, at an estimated $4,000 and books at about $800, that should come to the lovely total I mentioned before. 
Granted:
I don't *have* to pay back OSAP right away, so I *could* consider it $16,100. I will be earning money over the summer as well, and if I can get a job with tips that could mean good money. Assuming I don't, I can get about 4 grand, so that's $12,100. OSAP may give me money again, let's say $4,000 (which albeit adds more debt! yay! but will provide temporary relief) brings me to $8,100. If I can get on the list for Queen's Work Study Program, I can work during school to earn as much as $2,000. Down to $6,100.
I have about $3,000 right now, so provided that stays more or less intact we come to $3,100.
The plan for that? Apply to every bloody scholarship/bursary/grant offer I possibly can, cross my fingers, and hope for the best. Twitch. In for one fun summer.

The stress of that combined with the minute detail of having mysteriously lost the jump drive I got with this rented laptop from the ISC at some point this last month has actually led to me waking up this morning with an eye twitch. This hilarious condition I've experienced only when I'm very stressed out, so it's nothing serious, if not amusing and weird.

The jump drive i'll continue to look for. I was so good about not losing it all last term, I'm quite disappointed that I suddenly have, at some point, without being aware of it, lost it. I do have another jump drive with me, but when it comes time to returning this laptop I'll ask them if I can either trade that in in recompense (provided I haven't found it yet) or pay for it to be replaced.

The weather's looking fabulous here. Mornings are cloudy and frosty, but by noon the sun is blazing in a clear blue sky and it's actually warm and green. Apparently spring here starts in about mid February.

Yesterday a little daschund puppy was found wandering the little path to the Castle. I was lucky enough to be the first to see her as one of the maintenance guys brought her in from the cold. She was shivering and absolutely adorable... a few of us including Christian put her on a cushion and showered attention on her until the receptionist located her owner: one of the farmers ""next door."" We'd talked so much of adopting her as our mascot and calling her Alfred (we'd thought she was a he, being of the strange condition of generally automatically calling small animals ""him"" instead of ""she"") after Dr. Bader.

Well, it's back to the grind. The sooner I finish this work the better. Yesterday I was so intolerably unmotivated I rented Bridget Jones' Diary and Raiders of the Lost Ark simply to waste time while my brain had turned itself stubbornly to mush.

Good luck to all with assignments due soon!

Over and out."

Ok, Christina and I are taking the place we got from the lottery.
It's a brick student house on Barrie st., with three apartments. The bedrooms are nice and big, and one even has a kind of triple bay window deal--gonna have to fight over that one. 
Rent's decent, considering everything is included except for laundry (in the building) and food.
Our backyard is basically Queen's.

The real question now is, what to do about the summer. I want to live at home so I can at least have 4 months ""with"" Kyle (we'll both be working like mad I expect) before I leave him for another 8 months away--although this away is much closer. A cell phone might help considerably. On the down side, I cost the parents money if I'm living at home, and me too: that's 4 months rent, and even if we could sublet it I'd feel bad for Christina and that would be a lot of hassle too.

On the other hand, I'm excited about living ""on my own,"" and if I can get a job in Kingston I might be able to work there some of the time when I'm at school. I love the idea of settling in over the summer and taking time to acquaint myself with the city and the apartment. 

I'm really very torn. But there are still a couple months to think it over, so hopefully I'll draw up enough pro and con lists to sort it out.

In the meantime, YAY for not living in a cardboard box on the sidewalk!!"

I've ""won"" a housing unit from the Queen's May Housing Lottery! 
This means Christina and I have first dibs on a place on Barrie Street, that she's checking out for us on Monday, and then we decide if we want it.

I'll be getting two lessons a week now from Christian, starting next week!

I'm back from Bath and the Tate, pictures from both are up on Facebook. 
Bath was very cute, and the Tate was wonderful.
I don't have another field trip until the end of February, though."

"event","First, to clear my head: 
Just came back from Pilates! A pleasure as always, especially with Maria doing classes now, she's most awesome. 
OSAP has come in! I've paid off the credit I owed (until the hotel bill comes).
Venice photos, in two parts, are now up on Facebook.
I've done all I can for the application form for the new house Christina found (the other was snatched up) which I am in love with but shh, don't tell Fate, it likes disappointment, until I have to fax it tomorrow morning. Again, expecting it to be sold. [UPDATE: it's sold.]
Things with Kyle are wonderful. He's planning something for me for when I come back, a trip I've deduced. A game has resulted in which I have two official ""Are we going here?"" guesses allowed a week, and one definite yes or no guess a day. I get an extra prize if I guess it before the end. 
School is rushing along at an alarming pace. The essay for Art History worth half of my mark is due in three weeks. We're going to the Tate this friday, and to Bath on Saturday.
Money must be taken out at some point by the end of that weekend to pay up the small debts I've collected.

And now you are wondering about Venice, no?

Here goes.
We left Thursday afternoon to a Severe Storm in England. The airport website mentioned no delays or cancellations, so we took our chances and trained to Gatwick. Upon arrival, we checked in as usual, only to discover that security was not letting Easyjet passengers through, and would say no more. Confused and clueless as to what to do, the regular airport ritual having been disrupted, we could do nothing but wait. Slowly, more and more people accumulated in the Check-In area, mysteriously. Finally, an airport official called down to the masses, explaining he had personally suspended Check-In, for safety reasons, because the airport would be clogged with people if flights were cancelled. Much frustration (happily not for us) ensued. 
Eventually, we got on our plane, to only half an hour's delay. Despite Stanstead and a couple other airports shutting down, only two flights in Gatwick were cancelled: one to Toulouse, and another to Milan.

We arrived in Venice at about 10 o'clock P.M., and walked 5 minutes to the pier, where a water bus would take us to the island. That was a bit sketchy, waiting on an empty dock in the middle of the night, but more tourists came in as the departure time approached, and we made it to our stop outside Piaza San Marco alive.

I have to say here that this night was not particularly enjoyable. We were both miserably cold, it was dark, the streets were deserted, and we could not for the life of us find our hotel. The directions, after spending hours on the internet trying to find better ones, were misspelt and vague, and began with ""turn wrghit (sic) and cross three bridges,"" which seemed simple, except that S.Zaccaria has three stops. We later realized our troubles stemmed from the fact that we had been dropped off on the last S.Zaccaria stop, which had already crossed one bridge, so we had been going one bridge too far. 
After finally finding a nice looking Italian man, I asked him for directions and he kindly led us to the square we needed to get to, and showed us our hotel.
We opened the door, to find 4 flights of extremely tight-winding staircase to carry our luggage up. Once we got to the top, 2 hours later than when I said we'd check in, we were met by the concierge, who looked like the Ministry of Magic's Igor-like assistant in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, sporting a very pretty cocaine nail.
After an awkward exchange of broken English, he showed us to our room, which was a very pretty little pink room with a bed, a sink, a lovely window, and a big closet.
Except--that's not what I had ordered.
I showed him the printed off credit receipt, plainly stating that I had paid for a 4-person hostel room to be shared, he sat back down at his desk and made a number of phone calls. Finally, I talked to someone who spoke English, and explained the problem. Too tired to fight for my original purchase, I told him I'd take the room as long as he didn't charge me more for it. He happily agreed, and we collapsed, stressed, frustrated and unhappy, into the bed, hoping that the next morning we'd feel better about being in Venice.

And so we did.
The minute I walked outside the door of our hotel to the bright (albeit cloud-covered) morning, I loved Venice instantly. I hope the pictures speak for themselves. 
It *was* bitterly cold, I had to buy a hat (very warm and very cozy) and a scarf out of necessity, but both were cheap and will be put to good use. 
We did everything we could in Venice: Piaza San Marco: St. Mark's Cathedral, fed the pidgeons, the Doge Palace, the Museum of Venetian Civilization, we would have gone up the belltower but it was closed for construction, and then a gondola ride, the Rialto Bridge, and of course bought some of the famous Murano glass. 

St. Mark's was absolutely breathtaking. I loved it in Art History when it was just a slide, because it's so Eastern looking, but it was so much more gorgeous in real life. The marble is incredible. We got to go inside too, but the nave was closed off for a military ceremony, and no pictures were allowed. We also got to go out onto the top of it, to a balcony.

The Doge Palace was ridiculously extravagant. The ballroom, one of the largest rooms in Europe, was mindbloggling. We couldn't take pictures of anything inside it either, you'll have to take my word for its luxury.
I loved the Armoury collection they had too! Again, rooms of cases of weapons.
One of the more memorable things they had on display too was a chastity belt--I'd never really thought hard about how those things might function. Definitely NOT a pleasant thing to see in person... very... spiky.

The Museum of Venetian Civilization was good, a little pompous, but good. It had an awful set-up though, a real maze. 

Feeding the pidgeons was FUN. At the start, I didn't really think it would be... but I came to love pidgeons, and found them to be adorable. There's something irresistably charming (unless you hate birds) about just putting your arm out in the middle of them, even if you don't have food, and having one or two fly up onto your arm and look cute at you. 
But if you DO have food.... wow. they know. And once they know for sure, they just come swarming on top of you. It sounds like it might hurt, like they might claw you or peck you or something, but they're actually very gentle towards you. They fight *each other* a bit, but when they're on you the worst you can get is a bit of a wing buff. It's one of the strangest feelings, I definitely recommend it. And one of the oddest attractions I've witnessed. You could be infront of St. Mark's Cathedral all day, this huge, gorgeous, ancient building, and people will seemingly flock to these pidgeons, shrieking in amusement because they got the chance to feed them. Never mind the Cathedral.

The Rialto was good, a great view. We had gelato and sandwiches for lunch beside it.

The gondola ride was absolutely lovely. We were afraid it would be too expensive, but we got it for 30 Euros each, down from 40 due to our excellent bartering skills ;)
I hope the pictures from that ride speak for themselves too. The gondolier gave a bit of a tour, showed us the house where Casanova lived, and Marco Polo. 
The funniest thing was when his cell phone started to ring, and he began talking on it for a good while. A man on a bridge above us shook his head at him at his rudeness, although I was laughing, and he promptly ended his conversation.

There was, overall, this feeling of dormant magic in Venice. This was because of the Carnival costumes and masks on sale at nearly every store and vendor's stall. The Carnival is coming up, and I can't even believe how amazing and wonderful it would be to have all the little streets of Venice full of people dressed up in the masks I saw on sale. Absolutely beautiful creations.

We left Venice very sad to go, we had a fabulous time, I recommend it for sure."

"event","This morning was completely unprecedented.
I woke up from a dream about being up in the top of a huge, dark house, and don't remember much other than Kyle running up the stairs to make sure I was ok.
But within a few seconds from being up and awake, I was back in bed, curled up and literally trembling in fear. The thought of going out in my hallway terrified me, of walking to the castle, of being in class, of anything and everything. It was the hugest wave of insecurity I think I've ever had, and it scared me even more that I was actually paralysed by it. 

Happily, it passed. Or rather, I forced myself up and forced it to pass. But I'm still pretty disturbed by it, even though now I can rationalize it to the point of it being explained:

Very recently, Christina Sun and I have formalized plans to live together, so literally within about a week and a half she's gone house shopping, and we are cementing the decision on Wednesday. In two days. The whole idea of living in an actual house wasn't scary at all to me, while it remained an abstract: it was a symbol of freedom and independence. But as it's clarified itself into a reality, I'm quite scared. It comes with things attached like monthly rent and utilities payments, groceries, furniture... all things Naomi I'm sure you consider old news. It's stressing me out. Even if I declare that these are normal things any approximately 18 year old has to calmly deal with anytime they move out, they're still frightening. I know I'll settle into them well, and that they will be dissolved into normal comfortable things as soon as I actually have to do them... but as they stand right now they're looming and intimidating. 
The only thing I can really think of as to *why* it's so scary is because it's a House. A Big House. And to my childhood mind, a House is the last thing in the step to adulthood (ok, other than say life insurance and a minivan etc.), the last resting place of the Mature and the Competent. 
A place you go shopping for once you marry someone.

Which leads me to the underlying reason for my fear.
I'd like to call myself a fairly non-traditional girl. I'm not the type that wants to get an education in order to get a good enough job to support my family and find a good enough man to settle down with and have kids. I'm getting an education for me. I love my independence. I have yet to see the appeal of marriage beyond monetary perks. 
But yet...
Why is there some sad lament in my heart that I'm moving into my first House with the boy I love 4 hours away? That I am doing anything but leaping for joy at the thought of coming back from 7 months in England, only to leave 4 months later for another 3 years of a 7-month long, long-distance relationship? YAY (?????) What happened to my thirst for independence? I thought I was perfectly happy with living my life and he living his, and us meeting in the middle when we found it delightfully convenient, with his love in the back of my mind and his in mine. 
But why does this feel so perfectly un-ideal? Too difficult, too challenging, too sad and too stretched? And yet, there is no other option!
Do I need more? Should I need? 


And this is what finally got me out of bed this morning.
Yes I feel safe and secure and loved in his arms...
but no, I don't need him. 
Some nights, and apparently some mornings, it would be a world easier to have his arms around me for just one second of a hug, but Life ain't fair.

And so knowing that these next 3 years of my life will not be perfect or easy, I accept. 

And resisting the temptation of feeling nostalgic about the simplicity of life in highschool and the luxury of time and something other than a (what? how strange!) long distance relationship, I have to admit I would still change nothing. 
The trade-off is definitely worth it.

Special thanks goes out to my mom, who wrote me an awesome rational email and made me feel tons better.

And much love to the K Dub, and those who are in it!"

"event","Today was my second day of classes. It's a bit later than I originally wanted to have posted, but it's just honestly taken until now for me to be in a bright enough mood to post. The days that need nothing done are the ones that pass the most painfully, but those are over until the mid-term break. Now that I have work to be done every day and night, missing home can more easily slip my mind.

I'm taking the same courses as last year. They are all full year courses except for two, which carry-over.
We got our marks today for all but one, my religions class, because the Queen's board was upset at our teacher for giving us all higher grades than the status-quo. Rumour is, they're dropping our marks because of it, and he will begin marking differently.
I'm content with my average. It's definitely not what I'm used to seeing on my highschool report card, but I'm just as if not more proud of the work I did to get these marks so they might as well be 90s.

My classes this year are looking pretty good. With a little moving around tonight I should be able to arrange them to be done on Wednesday again. 
History this year looks to be easier: no big term paper, it's a ""creative"" project that I've got a brilliant idea for already.
Art History is very interesting this year, it's less about beauty and perfection and more about politics and society.
Religions, thanks to our apparent mastery of it last term, looks like it will have a bit of a challenging twist this term.
In English our reading list is composed entirely of things I haven't read, and
French I haven't actually had yet, it's tonight, but it will probably be just as fun as last year.

Some of the trips we'll be going on include Paris (the Eiffel Tower, Napoleon's Tomb), Brussels, The Tate Britain and Tate Modern, the Jane Austen Centre, the Nazi's V2 Rocket Factory, Ypres and Versailles.
There are noticeably less than last year, but I'd like to make up for it by going to Oxford for a few days.

Most importantly, I'm leaving for Venice in 9 days! We've found a hostel that's in ""the heart of the city"" (aren't they all?) and for about $100 for 3 nights. We're not really sure what we're doing there, other than walking around and going on a gondola ride. I also have to bring back some glass for Jelena.

The last thing that I should add, which is the reason I'm in such bright spirits to be typing this, is the fact that I was talking to Christian Petrozza, the other Queen's fencer here, about fencing, and it occurred to me that I might ask to take lessons with him! He has very pleasantly agreed, so as soon as we arrange a time and some payment, I will have my fencing fix and should have motivation to train regularly!

"event","I've very little else to do here before I leave, so I think it's time I write about one of the more interesting incidents here at the ISC.

I'm calling it the tale of Miss M., who will not be fully named for reasons of confidentiality.

Miss M. was probably the most innocent girl any of us knew here. Exceptionally tiny, with huge doe eyes and a quirky sense of style, she was 17 and had, amoung other accomplishments, produced an independent film called ""Cries of Innocence,"" which documented the months she spent living with homeless orphans in railways stations in India.
She was also the co-editor of our paper here, The Keep. Brilliant, funny, and sharp, no one suspected in the least what would happen next.

Things began to go missing at the ISC. Expensive things. Someone's iPod, some else's $500 earrings... rumours started to swirl and suspicions were handed out left right and centre. 
This is about the same time that another girl at the ISC had to leave, because of a serious illness that she wasn't able to cope with while travelling and living at the ISC, because the right food just wasn't available all the time. For a few days, her room was left with no one in it, and she sent out an email declaring that what possessions she had left could be taken for free, or at a little cost. 
This is when Miss M. re-entered the picture. Someone claimed to have spotted her at least twice coming out of that girl's room, which was strange, because the possessions she'd left to be taken were in a box outside of her room. We all knew that her door didn't shut properly, but no one actually went *in* it.
Shortly after, the iPOD and earrings went missing. 
A stern email from administration was sent out, warning against future thefts.

At about this time, I was going to leave for Amsterdam. But the night before I left, Ali came into our room to tell me that there was some serious drama going on upstairs. Tom, one of the sort of dons here, had been heard outside Miss M's room, asking her if she knew the whereabouts of the iPod. She said no, but he pushed the question, asking her if she was sure. She said Well, it might have gotten mixed up in her things, so she'd look around for it but didn't think it was there. Tom attempted to gain entry into the room, but at her refusal he told her he'd be back in about 10 minutes to see if she'd found it.

I heard nothing else about this, because I left for Amsterdam. But when I came back, I noticed that Miss M wasn't around. A week went by, and I began to be concerned. I asked around about this and, apparently, Miss M had completely vanished.
The dons had been keeping it quieted up, but someone knew something about her living in London, that she had told someone she was thinking of dropping out of school...
no one has seen her since. the thefts have since stopped.
Whether or not she is innocent or guilty, no one knows, but for some reason or another one of the brightest students here has disappeared."

We found King's Cross station too, and Platform 9 and 3 quarters. Photos are on Facebook.

"event","Two exams down: Art History and French.
Feeling Very good about them, that I wish I could celebrate for kicking ass... but it's back to the grindstone. I have a History exam tomorrow, and English the next day, both of which have never heard of Yes or No answers.

There should be a sweet update on Thursday night.

Speaking of Friday! Although I wasn't. The trip to see Wicked has turned into an epic Harry Potter day as well. Stacey and I are planning on going to Platform 9 and 3 quarters, at King's Cross Station, but only before visiting Hadley's Harry Potter section and hopefully picking up a scarf. If I do get one, it just might be the happiest day of my life. And just when I thought the trip couldn't improve more, turns out Jess was planning to go to London anyway on Friday, so she's coming along for the ride. I love both of them, so this should be a killer ""I Have 7 Days To Study For a Religions Exam"" adventure.

The Oxford Tolkien Pilgrimage (see a previous post) is unofficially still on for Saturday or Sunday.

And then, guess what kids? I'm home next week!"

"event","Last night was definitely one to remember.

The End of Term ceremonies were short, but very sweet.
The choir sang, and with 60 members, ""Hallelujah"" was stirring, even to an atheist.

There were 3 very special highlights, however.
The first was Shirely Wang, who was one of 2 students talented enough to take lessons with Shelley Katz, one of the musicians in Residence. She played the last movement of the Moonlight Sonata brilliantly, and earned a standing ovation.

The second was Libby, who sang (the only I've seen at an ISC function) accompanied by Shelley.
She opened her mouth, and I literally looked beside me to see where the speaker was. 
It was the most beautiful, most effortlessly penetrating voice I have *ever* heard. 
While most singers I can admire for trying really hard and taking many lessons to get their talent, it sounded like Libby had just been born with this sultry and smooth-as-butter voice. It was incredible.

The last highlight was when Sandy the groundskeeper stood up to speak to us with a pint of Guinness in his hand.
Clearly already tipsy, he proceeded to give the most lewd and crude speech I've ever heard at a school, which had the whole school rolling in the aisles... there's no way I can repeat anything he said, it wouldn't give his comedy the justice. Suffice to say I haven't laughed so hard in a very long time.

After that we had a slideshow of pictures people had sent in from the past 3 months. Definitely brought everyone together. Well, that and the dozens of bottles of wine. 

I love this place. 
I do.

(I'd also like to document this date as the day I got my history essay back. History has probably been the most stressful course I've ever had--but I got a Damn Fine mark on this essay, and I am Very proud.)"

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">An idea of what it's like to live here: <br /><br />From the Facebook Group ""You Know You've Been at Herstmonceux Too Long When..."" <br /><br />+ Explanations! <br /><br />1) <strong>Thursdays make you thirsty</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Thirsty Thursdays"" get their name because Thursday is the last day of class before the weekend for everyone, so most anyone can be found at the campus pub.</em> <br />2) <strong>ATM's are god's gift to humanity</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no ATM at the Castle, money can only be taken out from the ""Financial office,"" only open for half an hour a day and only on certain days. </em><br />3) <strong>Dormcest isn't in your vocabulary, only blockcest</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We only have one dorm, and it's arranged in different lettered blocks</em>. <br />4) <strong>Forgetting your key in your room is totally fine as long as Andy is there <br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy is the insane but very friendly security guy who sometimes works reception</em> <br />5) <strong>Dr Scott is more than just a character in Rocky Horror</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history teacher insists on being called Dr. Scott <br /></em>6) <strong>Quiet hours actually mean something</strong> <br />7) <strong>You have no idea how to use a meal card</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guests at the Castle have to use them, we don't</em> <br />8) <strong>You shower in the dark</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bathrooms have motion-sensor lights... so if you shower for too long.</em>. <br />9) <strong>You know exactly how bloody loud ducks and cows can be</strong> <br />10) <strong>D-Block has meaning to you</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D-Block is where the parties are</em> <br />11) <strong>You know the beauty of ASDA and know that it is asda not A S D A <br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASDA (""asduh"") is the nearest large store</em> <br />12)&nbsp;<strong>You've gotten to a point where london isn't all that special any more</strong> <br />13) <strong>You eventually find a past connection with most people at the ISC </strong><br />14) <strong>You call it a coach</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than a bus <br /></em>15) <strong>You know what 18 hours on a coach feels like</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our midterm trip to Scotland took as many </em><br />16) <strong>You have photos jumping on Hadrian's Wall, Outside the Cavern, doing something you shouldn't do with a canon, and with your face in one of those cut out photo op things. <br /></strong>17) <strong>You know the bartenders and they know you</strong> <br />18) <strong>Open door policy includes leaving your door open OR dead bolting it </strong><br />19) <strong>You avoid the moat like a rabbi avoids shellfish</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can only guess what's in there..</em> <br />20) <strong>You know that everyone will know about everything you have ever done within a week </strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Gossip gets *around</em>* <br />21) <strong>A-Wing is a mystery</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The faculty hall, we're forbidden to enter</em> <br />22) <strong>Thanksgiving is the same food as every other day</strong> <br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kitchen staff do try... <br /></em>23) <strong>Foam soap</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bar soap is so impractical!</em><br />24) <strong>You have SLC's not RA's</strong> <br />25) <strong>You haven't watched TV in months</strong> <br />26) <strong>You can do a mean british and/or scottish accent</strong> <br />27) <strong>18th Birthdays are bigger than 19th&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>Drinking age is 18</em><br />28) <strong>Mail makes your day</strong> <br />29) <strong>You have two lives: At home, and at Bader <br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bader is our rez</em> <br />30) <strong>Peanut butter is gold <br /></strong>31) <strong>You have mixed feelings about calling Bader home</strong> <br />32) <strong>The Ratio is a horrible horrible thing (unless you're a guy) <br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 girls to 40 boys</em> <br />33) <strong>You know how expensive laundry can be <br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>2 pounds for a wash, 1 pound for a dry: about 7 bucks</em> <br />34) <strong>You have a four day week max</strong> <br />35) <strong>You realize that Crunchy Nut IS ludicrously tasty</strong> <br />36) <strong>You take the tube</strong> <br />37) <strong>You can give directions in London and find Cleopatra's needle with your eyes closed<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Whenever we go to London we're dropped off there</em>&nbsp;<br />38) <strong>You consider having a ballroom, grand hall, moat and ghosts no big deal and wanted to upgrade when you went to Scotland <br /></strong>39) <strong>You own one or all of a beatles shirt, a scottish scarf, union jack boxers, an ISC sweatshirt, and/or a scotland sweater</strong> <br />40) <strong>You don't do your essays and instead make stupid lists in an attempt at procrastinating just a little longer</strong> <br />41) &nbsp;<strong>When the fire alarm goes off (which is does ever 2 hours) you take a few minutes to get bundled up and make sure you have your room key before heading to the parking lot</strong> <br />42) <strong>No longer consider Daphne's soft core porn references in Arth to be disturbing</strong> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Our art history teacher, Daphne, delights in commenting on the attractiveness of the bodies of naked statues</em> <br />43) <strong>Have Gooblar on your most played list</strong> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One of the English teachers was recently discovered to have his own band</em> <br />44) <strong>When ""good"" food becomes ""anything with flavor"" <br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the kitchen staff do try...</em> <br />45) <strong>When you know that even though you woke up early enough and got on the ""safe"" coach, you end up with Lisa Ross reading the itinerary word for word an hour before you get into London...it's on the sheet and we're in university: i think we can handle it. (Although props to her for making some pimped out trips)</strong></p>"

The week I'm stuck here supposedly studying for 1 exam is over a weekend, so I've decided to take a train to Oxford to spend a day or two there doing the nerdiest thing I think I've ever done (other than, perhaps, Trilogy Tuesday) : A Tolkienite Pilgrimage. The plan is to see Oxford, Tolkien's grave, Tolkien's house (if it's still there?) and the pub he went to with C.S. Lewis. 
You'd think my geekyness would be satisfied with the Legend of Zelda coming out the day I get back but... nah :D

in other news..

I GET TO SEE ERIN TOMORROW!

I leave here at 0600 hours for Amsterdam, and won't be back until late Sunday night.

SO excited.
SO."

"event","We got back from Paris about 3 hours ago. Well, technically, from Ashford Train Station, but you get the idea.

Quick run through? 

Places visited:
- Notre Dame Cathedral
- The Rodin Museum
- Place des Invalides, including:
   The Arms and Armour Museum (""OMG DROOL"")
   Napoleon's Tomb
- L'arc de Triomphe
- The Eiffel Tour
- The Cluny 
- The Catacombs
- The Pantheon

Impressions:
Notre Dame was very.. white. I imagine it was because it has (I think?) been patched up. It's crazy to think that originally, these austere white buildings would have been completely covered in exceedingly bright colours and gold.

The Rodin Museum I can't describe other than it being a nightmare. Beautiful, but still a nightmare. It's arranged as an outdoor garden with bronze statues placed all through it, and then a manor house with the more delicate statues inside. 
I hadn't really seen much of Rodin's work, other than the famous one of the embrace and the other of the two hands, but there was something very disturbing about his work. The level of expression he could sculpt was unnerving. And the kind of mottled, lumpy flesh on many of the figures reminded me of grotesques. What I considered his best pieces conveyed such horror of condition or emotion, whereas his more peaceful pieces seemed to be side-projects to please critics. I'd recommend it still, it's definitely a very personal experience.

The Arms and Armour Museum!!! I practically fell on the ground when I walked into this. The first thing you see is a dummy in full knight's armour mounted on a horse, frozen as if charging towards you. The whole exhibit was absolutely drool worthy for an arms&armour geek, there were literally ROOMS FULL OF CASES of armour and swords. There were bows, crossbows, quivers, bow-cases, halberds, sabres, rapiers, epees... and a whole *hallway* gallery into a sort of store-room with *shelves full* of gauntlets, helms, chest plates, and the like, and even knight's armour assembled on wooden stands so that there were little armies of them, each individual. I would have spent days in there if I could have. 

Napoleon's Tomb. This was ridiculously impressive. I wish I had brought my camera, but pictures are easily available on the web if you can't call up an image to the name. 

The Arc de Triomphe was equally ridiculously impressive. There is so much of the monumental in Paris, I felt so small all the time in comparison. 

The Cluny. I didn't actually know about this place until our tour guide took us into the esplanade. It's a Medieval Museum, and was a lot bigger than I expected. It didn't exactly have what attracts me to the medieval era, namely what was in the arms&armour exhibit, but it was still interesting as a backdrop if I do actually want to major in that period. I enjoyed the looks the majority of people there (namely, elderly men) gave me in what seemed to be surprise mixed with admiration to see a young, blonde, foreign female student doing in a dusty museum about tapestries and altar pieces. The most interesting piece was the Lady and the Unicorn series of tapestries, which was absolutely fascinating. The meaning behind it is unknown, and there was a whole room dedicated to just sitting down and staring at the strangely amusing characters in it and wondering what the devil it all meant at the time.

The Eiffel Tower. I actually, if you can imagine, forgot about the Eiffel Tour when we got to Paris. I saw it on the subway map and thought ""Oh, yeah."" Maybe because the history attached to it isn't the kind that would attract me? I don't really know.

The Catacombs! Creepy as all hell. Yet somehow, walking for several kilometers underground with walls stacked with skulls and bones didn't scare me as much as it should have. But it's death definitely shoved in your face, so if it floats your boat to muse on mortality, I would recommend it. But watch for the dripping ceiling, and bring a flashlight :P

The Pantheon: unfortunately, I only got to see the outside of it, because we ran out of time. But we're going back for our midterm trip in February, so I hope to go back and see that. We'll also be going to Versailles, the Museum D'Orsee, and the Louvre, which are apparently essentiels. I hope to go back to see Saint Chapelle and St. Deny, as well as go into the Pantheon. 

Paris as a city, though, had strange vibes for me. Other people I talked to adored it, but there was something not right with me when I went. I had the French riots in the back of my mind when I went, because I was wondering what would possess people to smash and burn the cars in their own neighborhood in protest. But it definitely became apparent that there was something... not right between people in Paris. Costumer service does not seem to exist. You walk into a restaurant and you are invading on their territory. That sort of indifference mixed with the whole monumental grandeur of the attractions (Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, any of the big domed churches) mixed with a bloquade of communication and by the first night I felt impossibly insignificant. 
Yes, it was beautiful, yes it had great cafes and food, yes it has a rich history.. but I did not feel welcome. I didn't feel like I could ever amount to anything in Paris, swallowed by what Robert Pirsig called ""the Giant"" of the legends of Napoleon, the Louis, Antoinette, Moliere and the rest. It occurred to me that maybe the French riots occurred just so that they could finally be noticed in Paris. So that they too could be part of history. 
There was also something hostile in a class division of ""Nous, les Parisiens"" et ""Vous."" I noticed the majority of lower-paying jobs seemed to be held by people from ethnic backgrounds. I noticed this look, from up-to-down that is so critical, so analytic, I wondered if the make of my shoe registered a judgement with some people. 
This doesn't seem to be the opinion of most people I talked to about Paris. Ali, my roommate found it ""warmer"" than London. But for me, when I read that Sherraine McKay and her husband Geordie were thinking of leaving Paris for another country because of how they felt treated, I didn't understand at the time... now, I think I have an idea of why."

"event","Tomorrow I leave at the ungodly hour of 4AM to get on a minibus for the Ashford International Eurostar station. We're taking the train to France, and bussing to the centre of Paris for a 2 hour walking tour of Notre Dame and the Latin quarter.

I don't know how awake I'll be, but I have every intention of taking as many pictures as I can. We have lots of free time too, so I should be able to find an internet cafe sometime before Monday and throw in an update.

Saturday we virtually have the day off--we go to the Musee Rodin in the morning but have the rest of the day free until the evening when we go to see a popular musical about Louis XIV called Le Roi Soleil.

We come back Sunday night, I hope to update soon!"

"event","I had my first yoga class last night!
It was, unsurprisingly, incredibly relaxing, and I recommend it for anyone who's stressing out over school right now. 

I kind of came in on this several weeks into the classes going on, but to my pride I had no trouble at all with balancing. I think it has to do a lot with fencing (you know: the lunge, and generally moving around like a bizarre crab at high speeds and leaping at people and expecting to land without falling over, hurting oneself *and* hitting the other person... and then recovering back to en garde) and as well with the physio I had to do when I sprained my ankle ages ago. I found it was like an old training habit to focus on exactly what I needed to, to stabilize my centre of gravity. 

The French trip to Paris is rapidly approaching, it's this Friday until Sunday. 

Then the next weekend I get to see ERIN! Our Awesome Amsterdam trip is zooming up fast, and the kids I've talked to here who have already been over to Amsterdam are telling me I'm going to adore it.  

I digress. Back to essays!"

"event","Last Saturday was yet another trip to London.
--Funny how these days all the kids are like ""Yeah, London again, but what you gonna do?""

I had two course-specific places I had to be in at two points in the day. The first was the British Library for English. The exhibit we went to, actually the only one we really could go to, because the rest required ""reference passes"" or some such silliness... was a little room filled with Really Old Books. 

The highlights of the exhibition sound very impressive in concept: The Guttenburg Bible, The Magna Carta, some of da Vinci's drawings, the original Alice in Wonderland, the original Homer translation, the original Chaucer, original Beowulf, some of Shakespeare's earliest printing etc.
But in reality, they were all very very small, slightly yellowing books open to a single page that one peered over a thick glass display to look at.

Was it wrong that the most delight I took from all such precious masterpieces was the original copy of ""Rikki Tikki Tavi"" by Rudyard Kiping, and not because of the genius of the work but because it was one of the earliest favourite stories I had as a kid?

A girl beside me was staring in rapture at Homer for a very long time, uttering over and over again with no loss of awe, ""Such a *brilliant* translation!!""
Yes, yes it certainly is, but why praise for the brilliancy of work that--unless she was reading it for the first time, which I find unlikely--she could only have known before, that I can't imagine becomes any more apparent by looking at one open page in ""the flesh""? Was there some flick of a penstroke or side-margin scribble that showered new insight? Why people feel the need to ""see"" the Magna Carta or ""see"" other original works I no longer understand. Read them any way you can, and understand them, their importance is in their ideas not their form. The way I felt, one gains no new perspective or glimmer of better comprehension by blinking at a less legible though slightly more quirky version through layers of glass, only a checkmark beside a (possibly? probably?) pretentious List of Accomplishments in Life. I sort of imagine two people sitting across from each other in large easy-chairs and a fireside smoking on pipes, having a contest of ""Well, I've seen...""
On the other hand, what is life other than a checklist of experiences? And some may only be here for a little while longer, as they say, Venice is sinking into the sea...


The second place I had to be in was the Victoria and Albert Museum, to see the Islamic Art exhibit. This too was a very small room, but filled with such beautiful intricate design, colour, and detail that I adored every bit.
I was supposed to be sticking with my class and following my teacher around to every piece while he ""lectured,""--rather, half-read off the little sign in the case and repeated the same things so quietly nearly all had abandoned taking notes. Instead I walked around on my own, giving the museum a chance to do what it was supposed to do, which was teach me. In the process of ambling, I met another ISC student who had also abandoned traditional methods, an upper year, who of all things offered to give me some tips on the assignment we had been given, and turned out to be a Medieval History major! 
I did have a surge of excitement when I saw the signs for the Leonardo Da Vinci notebook exhibit, but when I rushed to go buy a ticket I was informed they were ""sold out"" for that day.

Getting from the British Libary to the V&A museum did take some time, but Stacey and I took Oxford Street (which I had yet to be on) down Park Lane next to Hyde Park. I'm actually getting to know London well from walking around it, which is a great feeling. 

This last Sunday was another trip to the ASDA (Walmart) for some essential snacking supplies and a couple warm sweaters, and then to the University of Sussex library for some research on Scotland for my History paper.

Only a few more weeks until exams!"

"event","Tonight is Isabel Bader's 80th Birthday Bash.
  well, formally ""An Evening of Celebration"" :P
She's the wife of Dr. Bader, the one who gave Herstmonceux Castle to Queen's. They actually have a house in the neighborhood during the summer, and visit on a semi-regular basis. Some of us were waiting for the caf to open yesterday afternoon, and they just strode down and struck up a conversation with us. 

We're all pretty excited about it, not only because we get to dress up a bit, but I think we've all developed a love for the Baders, and not just because we have them to thank for the Castle
(although remarking ""our castle is prettier than this castle!"" in Edinburg shouldn't be taken for granted ;)).

We also get to see the Musicians in Residence perform, along with the Chamber choir. If i hadn't told you about the time we met the Musicians in Residence, they struck up an impromptu rendition of Mozart's The Night Queen at our request. 

I'm not sure what else is in store tonight, but I'm definitely looking forward to it!

On another note, I've decided to join at least one class a week at the Hailsham Leisure Centre, so at least I'll be in shape for fencing at Queen's, if I can't be trained. 

Hope everyone had a great hallowe'en!"

Wondering what i did for the past 5 days? Confused by facebook pictures and want to know what they're about?
You're in the right place. 

The Midterm Trip.. in brief.

Sunday!
This was an 18 hour coach ride beginning at 5:30 am. granted, it definitely didn't feel like it, because we had occasional rest stops and movies, and a big break when we stopped at the National Coal Museum of England. 
This was actually pretty fun.. not as fun as the salt mine in Salzburg, but fun nonetheless. I don't have pictures, because they were pretty hardcore about not bringing anything with a charge--including watch batteries--down inside.
we arrived at our Travelodge hotel in Edinburgh at 10 pm.

that night all the kids from the ISC basically spilled onto the streets of the Old Town, because we'd been so restless on the coaches, in search of pubs or locals to get in fights with (apparently this is true with the guys--getting in a fight with another scottish guy is actually a goal).

it was a little odd, because there were so many tourists including us that in asking someone for a pub they'd recommend, you were just as likely to have ""Sorry, I'm from Norway"" than ""turn right.""

Monday!
The art history kids got to tour the National Gallery of Scotland. It's a really pleasant gallery, usually described as someone's living room because the floors are carpeted and the rooms are so small. there was impressionist art as well, which was a nice change from all the renaissance glory.
i have a lot of pictures from the area around the gallery, which was heavy with parkland and old parliament-looking buildings (the actual scottish parliament is a very modern building). the gallery was also right beside my favourite part of Edinburgh: a gothic tower monument to Sir Walter Scott, as well as Edinburgh Castle.

That day was also the tour of the Castle, which was much more rugged than Herstmonceux for obvious reasons :P
It was still beautiful in its own right, if not creepier ;)

Tuesday!
There was a trip to New Lanark for the poli-sci students, but it was optional for the rest of us and i went along too. I'd never heard of this place before, but it's a World Heritage Site and turned out to be exceedingly important for socialism during the industrial revolution. it was a little town built up around the River Clyde's cotton mills. the first owner had populated the factory with orphans and families who didn't make it over to the U.S. from the highlands. the second owner, Robert Owen, introduced social reform by disallowing children under 10 from working in the factories, and building a school for them. conditions in the little factory town were leagues ahead of conditions in other industrial areas, and New Lanark became the most successful cotton factory in Britain, and with Britain the leader in the Industrial Revolution, this made Robert Owen a very rich man.
it was also incredibly beautiful there, and the forests reminded me a lot of Canadian wilderness scenery.
something was a little creepy about it all, however... there were definitely some personality cult vibes.

ooh, as a side note, this is the place that produced Ron's ugly sweater in Harry Potter that his mom is supposed to have knit for him. they also sell Dumbledore's favourite candy, sherbet lemons.. clearly a marketing ploy but hey, i was sold.

This night i was invited to see The Rocky Horror Picture show at the Edinburgh Playhouse. I'd never seen Rocky Horror... but i've never, ever had so much fun at a show before!! I loved it. Loved! It was amazing.

Wednesday!
We left the hotel in the morning and coached to Hadrian's Wall. this was built by the Roman emperor Hadrian to control the entrance of the Picts into his territory. we visited a fort next to the wall, one of 13. if an invasion happened, they would light signal fires at these forts to warn a legion that was camped more or less closeby, which would be deployed.
there wasn't much left of the stones, most had been stripped by farmers for their foundations, but it was still incredible to be climbing and walking through the skeletons of Roman barracks and imagining the smells, the food, and the men who lived here.

we arrived in Liverpool that night to our youth hostel. I don't have any pictures of Liverpool, because it reminded me so much of Kitchener! It was like that one stretch between downtown and uptown that's industrial and full of abandoned warehouses. 
we went out for Italian food, which was absolutely to die for, since none of us had actually been to a restaurant in such a long time.
as an added bonus, my friend bekka, who also has a boyfriend, in boston, that coincidentally enough just celebrated her 6 months a few days ago, offered to lend me her phone because she was trying to use up her minutes, and i got to call Kyle for about 4 minutes.

Thursday!
We had walking tour of Liverpool in the morning. the weather was awful, it was windy, cold and rainy, but by noon it was actually starting to clear up! we had from 11-4 to do whatever we wanted, and i had such a great time in the shopping district buying christmas presents. they call liverpool ""the world in a city,"" and in a sense it feels of true. you can sit on a dock overlooking the city and the Mersey river that leads to the sea, and feel connected to everything.

the coach ride back was about 8 hours, and we were all SO glad to see bader hall that night!
it really has become a home here."

"event","Wow, so even more catching up to do!

There was a huge art history midterm paper that was being written since my last post, worth half of my mark, but now it's all over and i have a whole week of no-stres and a trip to Scotland! but i'm getting ahead of myself.

Canterbury!
The city was so beautiful! It had that awesome winding cobblestone street medieval town feel. There was also a festival going on so there were locals all over the place. it was great to see a change from the london posh to a cool gypsy/bohemian indy culture. a band was playing the chili peppers, and gnarls barkely which made me so happy :P

And the cathedral itself.. I think i literally stumbled with my jaw dropped when i first looked up. it was positively huge.
I've been used to churches with, say, a single nave and some side-aisles but Canterbury goes off in every direction! There are *two* huge naves, *two* transepts, a CRYPT from the Romanesque period, two towers, many little chapels that branch off, and the cloisters!
I've never been anywhere so magnificent, and detailed. vertical gothic architecture blows my mind ;)

Our next trip is the midterm trip to Edinburgh and Liverpool. we leave on monday at 4am (AAH) and won't be back until thursday night.
Since my camera fits 22 pictures at a time, I'm bringing my laptop along (no worries, it's locked up) so that i can a)communicate quicker and b)be able to take tons of pictures! the only other fear is that my batteries get used up :D

if anyone has any special requests for scottish christmas presents, or things they want brought back in general, now's the time!"

I don't even know how to express how happy I was to receive the care package the other day!!
I got it while writing my midterm so as much as I was dying to write everyone who sent me such thoughtful things gushing letters of gratitude, i couldn't until now!!
if you haven't received an email yet, don't fear, it's coming.. but for now... thank you all SO much!!!!! I don't know who came up with the idea, or organized and collected the letters, cards and presents... but whoever you are... you're being written in on the top of my will ;) 
it was actually the nicest, most thoughtful thing i have ever received.. if you are that mystery person/persons...THANK YOU!!!
I've never been so happy :D

"event","Woo, just got back from London.
Friday was spent at the National Gallery, which although not as divinely presented as the British Museum, it was a dream come true. Seeing things like da Vinci's second Madonna of the Rocks, Rembrandt's portrait of a man, Velazquez, Vermeer, Rubens, Raphael, and Durer was so surreal.

Today was a trip to an Armenian church, which was pretty unique and interesting. I walked through Kensington market and gardens to get there, and it was such a lovely perfect day that it was amazing.

There are a few new London pictures, but Friday was so overcast and dreary the lighting doesn't do the subjects justice.

Tomorrow it's another early morning to the Nelson Museum in Porstmouth.

keep on rocking in the free world!"

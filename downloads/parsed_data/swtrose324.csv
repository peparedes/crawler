some guy who is also concentrating in finance sent emails to all finance students and it said something about there are only two courses offered for finance electives next semester and for those who need those classes to graduate and did not get in b/c there are only one section for each class...well they can basically forget about graduation...i guess i feel really bad for those who couldn't get their classes...but i'm glad i got into mine...but i was told that the professor that is teaching my section is leaving and they weren't gonna hire some1 else to teach that b/c of the high costs...what the hell is our tuition for?...i mean we're paying lots more and our classes get cut?...that really isn't fair at all...luckily the professor i have now who is suppose to be on sabbatical starting next semester will teach that class for us...so at least some of us can still graduate."

Evertime

Come notice me
And take my hand
So why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song is my sorry

Ohhhh

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby"

A kindergarten pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat, but it was dead.
""How do you know that the cat was dead?"" she asked her pupil.
""Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move,"" answered the child
innocently.
""You did WHAT?!?"" the teacher exclaimed in surprise. ""You
know,""explained the boy, ""I leaned over and went 'Pssst!' and it didn't
move.""

A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later....""Da-ad....""
""What?"" ""I'm thirsty. Can you bring drink of water?""
""No, You had your chance. Lights out.""
Five minutes later: ""Da-aaaad....."" ""WHAT?""
""I'm THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??""
""I told you NO! If you ask again, I'll have to spank you!!""
Five minutes later......""Daaaa-aaaad....."" ""WHAT!""
""When you come in to spank me, can you bring a drink of water?""

One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking
her son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with
a tremor in his voice, ""Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?""
The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. ""I can't dear,""
she said. ""I have to sleep in Daddy's room.""
A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: ""The big
sissy.""

It was that time, during the Sunday morning service, for the children's
sermon. All the children were invited to come forward.
One little girl was wearing a particularly pretty dress and,
as she sat down, the pastor leaned over and said,
""That is a very pretty dress. Is it your Easter Dress?""
The little girl replied, directly into the pastor's clip-on
microphone, ""Yes, and my Mom says it's a bitch to iron.""

When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my three year old
came into the room when I was just getting ready to get into the shower.
She said, ""Mommy, you are getting fat!"" I replied, ""Yes, honey,
remember Mommy has a baby growing in her tummy.""
""I know,"" she replied, but what's growing in your butt?""
____________________________________________

A little boy was doing his math homework. He said to himself, ""Two plus
five,
that son of a bitch is seven. Three plus six, that son of a bitch is
nine....""
His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, ""What are you doing?""
The little boy answered, ""I'm doing my math homework, Mom.""
""And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?"" the mother asked.
""Yes,"" he answered. Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next
day, ""What are you teaching my son in math?"" The teacher replied,
""Right now, we are learning addition."" The mother asked, ""And are you
teaching them to say two plus two, that son of a bitch is four?""
After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered,
""What I taught them was, two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.""

One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of ""Chicken Little""
to her class.
She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little tried to warn the
farmer.
She read, "".... and so Chicken Little went up to the farmer and said,
""The sky is falling, the sky is falling!""
The teacher paused then asked the class,
""And what do you think that farmer said?""
One little girl raised her hand and said,
""I think he said: 'Holy Shit! A talking chicken!'""

The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes"

"event","i dunno if i'm being unfair or wat but last night no1 knew my bastard uncle and his hoebag gf was even coming over...but when they did i got really pissed and just left the room b4 i ate dinner...i mean wat i think is that it would be nice if he had the common decency not to bring her over where he knows i live...then he saw the dtv card phu did for us and wanted my dad to get phu to do it...my dad said he'll ask...i told my dad when i found out... that if the bastard doesn't care to acknowledge me...then don't ask my bf to do things for him...i hate how my family always gets phu to do things for them...like when bac thanh needs a ride to house parties...or when some1 needs some thigs delivered...i'm happy they all really like him...but i hat how they all make him do things...sometimes i think that if something ever happened between me and phu then my family would be sad...they would probably have no1 to do favors for them...well gotta go study a little b4 class...i got two tonight...i think i shoulda just taken strategic management over the women's study course..oh wells...better get going...have a good day!!!"

"event","i'm up...gotta come to school today to meet with my group to tie up loose ends on our hw...then i gotta start studying for exams...i got three in a week...and i haven't really read much...mostly just using the notes to do hw.

last night's class was a drag...the guy tells us our exam in coming up soon...no review...we are allow a calculator...no notes...and one page of formulas...he won't even be giving the exam that day...but this chap 7 that we're on...man o man...it's freakin hard...we go through like one chapter a night with this guy and he makes us do hw for each class...without even going over how we suppose to approach a problem...so i sat in class attempting to get the problems and then anh sitting next to me asking what this and that means...it suprises me how she even passes the prerequisite for this class really b/c we had to use almost the same formulas...except now its an extended version with more crap to learn...and she lived through the prerequisite without a financial calculator...i dunno but i think some of the problems are pretty hard to do without that calculator.

well gonna go do some hw and then get ready to leave for school...i think i'm getting sick with this sudden weather change...well at least i only gotta be in school for a couple of hours...i don't think the meeting will take long...well have a good day and thank God its friday!!!"

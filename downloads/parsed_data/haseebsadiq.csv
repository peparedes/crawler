"event","As we grow older, we develop a better understanding of what life is based on our own unique circumstances. We develop an understanding of who we are and what we want to accomplish in life. We, all of us have an innate desire to achieve our goals which in turn are shaped by our dreams. Undoubtedly, there are some who feel lost and live their entire lives without direction but fortunately for me, I am not one of them. Our dreams or more aptly our preconceived notions of how life ahead of us is going to be like, are very different from what reality has to offer. Not that our dreams do not shape our destiny but they do so in a very subtle manner provided we value our dreams to that extent.
As I grow older and experience more of life, one by one my dreams turn into dust after the subtle effect they influence becomes a part of my reality. I have always been a dreamer and I have always looked to the future with excitement and the past with nostalgia. My past shapes who I am and my future is shaped my dreams. Most of what I desired in my dreams has come to pass if not as exactly and most of my past is worth remembering. Does that mean I have lived a good life? the answer to that I do not know. 
I have a vision now. It is as real as it gets because it isn't entirely idealistic nor is it entirely objective. It defines who I am and what I want to be. It is who I am and who I will be. It serves the purpose of my existence and if I can accomplish it, I will be content. However, this acceptance of reality comes at a price. The price of growing up and leaving behind those little gems that I call my dreams. Those little fantasies that have shaped who I am now. I feel sorrow at this loss. Some of them I still cling to but some of them I have rejected and I have put in a box sealed and left in the attic forever. 
I always thought I would like the US. I always imagined myself living in the US with glee. I always imagined finding love here with a white man with blue piercing eyes, black hair and a physique of a greek god. I always imagined finding fame and fortune here. It was a dream inspired by what I perceived life to be here. It was hope and thinking about it made me happy. It was an escape. How wrong did it prove to be! It is nothing as i had imagined it to be and the people are not like what they show in the movies and the books. My dream is shattered into little pieces, giving way to another one. One that involves pain and hardship of bearing the political instabilities and the lack of buying power. I want to return to my beloved home land. I want to lick its wounds and try to make them heal. I want to do that dearly even though the selfish side of me still relents and may perhaps prevail. Its strange how we humans know and still don't follow."

"event","<p>I am finally where I wanted to be all this time! I am finally in the US and for a while, I thought I had it all. Apparently that is not how life is and today after spending four very peaceful and rather merry weeks, I finally experienced an eye opener today. </p> <p>My room mate here at the university happens to be a white Caucasian male who also happens to be a little hard of hearing. Ring a bell? Yes history does have a way of repeating itself. Another Harris Mansoor in the making. Coincidentally, I am making the same mistake again by actually trying to befriend him like I did Harris Mansoor. Four weeks of peace and harmony and today all that harmony was shattered, when we got into a verbal brawl. Of course I am not the same Haseeb that would fight to the death in any verbal combat like I did with Ali back in college, nor am I in the relative safety of my home, so I quelled the situation in the best&nbsp; way I knew how to. He isn't wrong. He told me that I cut him when he's speaking and that is a negative habit I am aware of and should get rid of and that I try to impose my opinions onto others which is again something that I know is true in my case. That is my intent normally in every argument that I make. The way he handled it however, put me totally off balance. Not only did I feel degraded and belittled, I also realized my mistake. My mistake is to give into the temptation of fulfilling my childhood fantasy of befriending a ""superior"" (and consequently much more attractive) Caucasian male (and that friendship does include the prospect of going to the highest possible level). I cannot be friends with these people. They are different. They are colder, more private and more messed up than they appear. They are polite enough to ignore your transgressions ( the way they see it) but would give you a piece of their mind if you go too far (in their opinion). Life is cold and mechanical here and these people have adapted. They don't rely on humans for emotional support and comfort and they are generally taught to mind their own business which basically prevents them from being there emotionally for anyone but themselves because of the fear of infringing in someone's privacy. The worst bit is that I am the alien. I don't have rights here and I am not the part of the crowd. Like any realization, this realization has shook me up. All of a sudden I miss home more than I have missed it up until now. I miss and cherish my friends back home more than I did up until now and I generally know that I cannot really fit here because I can never leave a friend without giving emotional support that comes from the heart and the heart alone which is something people seem to do here. I am not saying that my room mate is a bad person. He is a lot better than most of his kind perhaps but I need to be more careful and gradually but surely increase the distance. Perhaps its not as bad as it seems and perhaps things may improve. I am not denying that eventuality but I cannot have another Harris Mansoor in my life especially when I am 25. I need to change tact as the situation requires it. I need to be the listener more than the talker and I need to stop giving out my opinions freely, stop cutting people in the middle of their speech and I definitely have to be more careful of how involved I get my room mate into my other affairs. I need to find a separate group of people to befriend from whom I should keep James (my room mate in question) at bay. Is that possible? Not now no but perhaps in a while.</p> <p>There is also the question of this new friend named Nabeel. I don't trust him for some odd reason. Apparently he seems like a nice guy and I have made the mistake of introducing him to James but I know that without me James would be pretty clueless as to how to deal with Nabeel and vice versa. There is a get together tomorrow at Nabeels place and I am unsure as to whether I should go or not, as to whether James would still go if I decide not to go and how to avoid offending Nabeel or any one of his friends because according to James, I did get annoying today with something that comes very naturally to me (a part of the fight we had today). I think I need more insight into the working of a typical american mind. Maybe from someone here but the question is who? Oh how I wish my friends were here and if they can help me even now. Lets see how things with Nabeel and his friends turn out. At the end of the day if I don't end up saying anything politically incorrect, they would be relating more with me than they would with James. I shouldn't feel insecure. I should go to the get together as well because I never back out and this will be a part of my learning and I will test my new resolutions tomorrow. </p> <p>All these matters are essential yet secondary. I should be putting more effort into my studies anyway which I am not doing right now. I am slacking and I will have to pay a price because of that. I must keep studies my priority and everything else a secondary priority. That's why I am here for. I am glad that I know now I would never want to stay here. I want to go back home once I am done and I can hardly wait even if this is rather prematurely said. My intuition tells me the lessons I learnt today are there to stay.</p>"

"event","<p>When your entire future hangs by a thread, when everything depends on just one thing, a strange sense of calm dawns on ones soul as helplessness prevails. Its just one more sign that humans cannot control everything and that there is a higher presence that signs an approval on even the most best laid plans before they are actualized. Just one thing stops me from being totally relieved and get a surety of what lies ahead. </p> <p>As I wait for my destiny to unfold, I am awestruck by the helplessness of us mere mortals in controlling their lives to the absolute detail. I am sure there must be many who would disagree and still believe that everything lies in ones own hands even destiny. I wonder how they deal with situations such as these. I am very close to fulfilling a major goal in my life and that is to procure a masters degree in a field of my choice i.e. an MBA. I have upgraded my initial focus from getting an MBA from LUMS to getting it from a university from the states after I got the approval from my mother and chief financier. I am going two weeks later than when I was expected due to not having the visa. I finally get a call from the embassy when I had lost all hope and returned home planning the next course of course of action. One small mistake made on the phone with the embassy officer and I've caused an inevitable delay and a lot of uncertainty. Now I have the approval of the university, even a seat but no passport. And every minute that passes leads to an eventual delay as the booking cannot be confirmed without a passport. If I don't get it beyond tomorrow, I will be delayed another two days and that is something that would make me extremely uncomfortable. I can only pray to God that I am not delayed beyond 17th. There is nothing that I can or cannot do to change the situation. On the other hand I can do a few things to get my mind off of this. Go out perhaps. Afshan Khalas house is extremely taxing on the nerves because of its emptiness. Then again that is my fault. Will I ever stop making mistakes? Mistakes that would have a direct consequence on my life? I am getting very sick of this. I am so anxiety stricken because of this passport issue that I cannot even ponder as to what lies ahead. I must calm down, leave everything on god and go relax. If only I had a car or something. I shall dine out with my brother and my sister in law. Afshan Khala sleeps serenely downstairs. Ill go pay her a visit and let my mind get free of this tension. </p>"

"event","<p>The time to spread my wings and fly draws near. It is the last month of fall of the year 2007 and I eagerly await the US student visa to be stamped on my passport and returned to me in one piece. I cant believe that I am finally going to the US! It has finally happened although I can very well get delayed because of the embassy.</p> <p>I had wanted to go to LUMS initially for an MBA but I wanted to go to the US long before LUMS and MBA. Long ago when I was small I was introduced to the American pop culture and I have been in love with it ever since. There were the cartoons, the comics, the movies and the Pakistanis returning from that country as kings. I developed fantasies of how it would be like living there reinforced by what I saw through the aforementioned sources. The sun shining differently, good looking men everywhere with great bodies shining under the sun, the rolling hills, the clothes, the snow, the wealth and the prestige! would it be all that I ask myself? would I come back? (many people including my own parents think I wont), would I want to come back? God has been very good to me in my life here...I couldn't ask for better parents, better siblings, better family, better friends and better memories so would it be all that good? Would I not want to return to the things I cherish the most in my life after God? I for now say nay. I shall return to all that I shall leave behind. </p> <p>It couldn't get any better. A university in the states that is relatively well ranked, on campus living and dining, affordable, an American education, an MBA, big hammad going with me! life couldn't be better in my opinion and I pray to god it remains so. I hope this is what has been destined for me. I feel it is. I trust god and my only regret is that I am not thankful enough and I don't pray as often as I should. I couldn't ask for more. I have my fingers crossed and god willing I shall be in the US in the first week of January for a two year long adventure! </p>"

<p>You? Lazy? No way. Ambitious and competitive, you're goal-oriented and make sure to keep your eye on the prize. You know that no one's big dreams ever came true by sitting on the couch or twiddling their thumbs.<!-- br--><br /><br /> If you're the subject of water cooler chatter, it's only because people are trying to plot your next power play. After all, just because you have ideas doesn't mean you're gonna publicize them. You know you'll never get that corner office or funding for your own business if someone else beats you to the punch. So until you're ready to show the world what you're up to, keep that secret, well, a secret. There's a strategy Bill Gates would endorse!</p>

<br />Ever thought about buying an SUV and joining a tennis club? You should, because you were made for the elite. We can tell that you enjoy many of the finer things in life, but for some reason you just can't make the leap to ""millionaire material."" Sure, that's a step down from the top of the money pile, but it's probably all for the best. Why? Perhaps because, when it comes down to it, you enjoy fun more than money. Cash is all well and good, and we can tell that you're pretty good at saving your dough when you put your mind to it, but you'd rather spend time outdoors, hang out with friends, or plan your next big trip than drool over your bank balance. After all, what's money for if you can't enjoy it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50669/tests/soapoperalife/index.jsp?testname=soapoperalifeogt&amp;resultid=C""><img width=""120"" height=""115"" border=""0"" alt=""Take this test at Tickle"" src=""http://web.tickle.com/cv/50669/http://i.emode.com/tests/soapoperalife/images/romantic_s.gif"" /></a><br /><br />  <br /><strong>          If you were on a soap opera, you'd be a Hopeless Romantic</strong><br /><br />  <br />         <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50670/tests/soapoperalife/index.jsp?testname=soapoperalifeogt&amp;resultid=C"">Is Your Life a Soap Opera?</a><br /><br />           Brought to you by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50671/"">Tickle</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50669/tests/troublemaker/index.jsp?testname=troublemakerogt&amp;resultid=B""><img width=""120"" height=""115"" border=""0"" alt=""Take this test at Tickle"" src=""http://web.tickle.com/cv/50669/http://i.emode.com/tests/troublemaker/images/determined_20041118_s.gif"" /></a><br /><br />  <strong><br />          You're a Determined Dissenter</strong><br /><br />  <br />         <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50670/tests/troublemaker/index.jsp?testname=troublemakerogt&amp;resultid=B"">What Kind of Troublemaker Are You?</a><br /><br />           Brought to you by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50671/"">Tickle</a><br />          <br />          <aa target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50665/tests/stardouble/index.jsp?testname=stardoubleogt&amp;resultid=F""><img width=""120"" height=""115"" border=""0"" alt=""Take this test at Tickle"" src=""http://web.tickle.com/cv/50665/http://i.emode.com/tests/stardouble/images/intellectual_m_s.gif"" /><br /><br />  <br /><strong>        Your movie star double is Ethan Hawke</strong><br /><br />  <br />       <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50666/tests/stardouble/index.jsp?testname=stardoubleogt&amp;resultid=F"">Who's Your Movie Star Double?</a><br /><br />         Brought to you by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50631/"">Tickle</a><br />        <br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50669/tests/bridgetjones/index.jsp?testname=bridgetjonesogt&amp;resultid=A""><img width=""120"" height=""115"" border=""0"" alt=""Take this test at Tickle"" src=""http://web.tickle.com/cv/50669/http://i.emode.com/tests/bridgetjones/images/foot_s.gif"" /></a><br /><br />  <br /><strong>          Your Bridget Jones moment is Putting Your Foot in Your Mouth</strong><br /><br />  <br />         <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50670/tests/bridgetjones/index.jsp?testname=bridgetjonesogt&amp;resultid=A"">What's Your Bridget Jones Moment?</a><br /><br />           Brought to you by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://web.tickle.com/rd/50671/"">Tickle</a></aa>"

You are a Rock Star which means you are a Success / Seeker Your primary sub-type is defined by ""Success"" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by ""Seeker"" characteristics.

That means you crave attention, the limelight, and the fawning admiration of millions. Chances are you have a bevy of fans and friends, and you like knowing how much others appreciate you. On top of this, you're a go-getter and you really shine under pressure."

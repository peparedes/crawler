so i got back from my california trip. we were supposed to go whale watching, to the Wild Animal Park, and to Magic Mountain but at the last minute my dad didnt really want to go to the animal park. and then we found out the six flags was closed to the public. which was totally LAME. i was excited for that too. wah! o well. i can wait til' next year when we go with church. that always so much fun! 

so i pretty much have no plans over break. except for a broadway show on sunday night. i was going to go to the switchfoot concert, but i wanted to hang out with friends more, especially since i just got back from my trip and all. so yeah... i pretty much wrote a lot.

"event","CDO WON!!! I'm kinda sad in the fac5t that my school lost, but im kinda happy we did because we were way to cocky before the game! And CDO deserved it. They played hard and earned the win. Well just about everyone was there! There was Me, Sarah, Emily, Heather, Andrea, Aaron, Ben, Paul, Austin, Josh, Garret, Gabe, Phil, and of course Jeremy!!! And I convinced Max to come to this game and he did! i was so happy i havent seen him in like, a half a year! I think Gabe might be mad at me for inviting him. maybe. Well it was really fun!!! And crowded!!!

I made the soccer team! yay! JV. but JV is much more fun than V. And the coach seems much nicer. Emily made it too, along with a lot of our old players on JV last year. which is good because we already know how to play togther as a team! I'm so stoked for the season! Well g2g watch The sisterhood of the Traveling Pants!!!

so basically my life s dull, but magic mountain is coming in 10 days and im super excited!!!! can't wait, going to pop a blood vessel in brain and die from anticipation."

"event","Well school was fun today!!! I got to all of my classes fine and i knew at least a few people in each of them. My english 10 teacher is really cool! But my Honors Geometry teacher is dislexic??? How ever you spell it. But how the heck is he supposed to write on the board if hes dislexic??? Anyway... Sam is in my Spanish 2 class and thats cool cause she was in my Spanish 1 class last year. We are learning Spanish together!!! Hmmm... I have Aerobics with Emily and Hannah so that should be fun!!!

I saw Yarrel at lunch today... I turned around and walked away. I guess i'm too much of a pansy to walk by him with all that happened and all. It was good to see Ryan today. he was being very friendly and I think he would definitly mak ea good friend. Hmm... Haven't seen Brandon around. Kinda miss him throwing staples at me though... haha that was sarcastic!!! For those of you that didn't know.

The bus was late today. we were all standing there in the hot heat for like a half an hour!!! It was horrible!!! Ryan and Tracy drove by and were laughing at me!!! It was funny. The not so funny part was sweating to death in the heat! gosh it was horrible!!!

Well thats enough of my first day!!! It was actually my first first day of High School. I was sick last year on the first day!!! I know IRONIC much!!!

 

See you all tomorrow!!!"

My grandpa let me and Sarah drive the golf cart around to get a feel for the wheel. haha that rhymes. anyway, ya i backed out of the garage garage pretty good then&nbsp;i over corrected&nbsp;and crashed into the bushes&nbsp;next to me so hard that Sarah almost flew out of the car. hehe. well the rest of the way i did fine. When it was Sarah's&nbsp;time to go she was all no i dont want to. well w/e. so ya that was basically my day.&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Today we hung out at the house. Then we went to see Batman Begins, again for us but my grandparents wanted to go so yay! I dont mind watching a movie i have seen already when Christian Bale is in it. haha. just kidding hes not that cute. hes ok. so after that Sarah and i went with my dad in the&nbsp;golf cart and Sarah drove! wow! CONGRADS SARAH! and then i drove again. The battery was low&nbsp;so my dad had to get out and push up the hills sometimes. but like only twice. Well today was fun. im gonna go eat some homemade cookies now. hehe. i'll talk to&nbsp;ya'll later.&nbsp;</STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>Well today was my first day of vacation. everyone was stressed when we were packin the car. (and by everyone i mean my dad) haha. well i love him. anyway. the drive to the airport was really short, probaly the only short drive i will have in the next two weeks.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>We waited at the airport for an hour at the gate. while we were there we met this young man. probaly just out of college. He was stationed here in tucson and was flying back to Rhode Island to go to his family's funeral. He told us that they were all killed in a car accident. All of them. hi mom, dad, and younger brother. so my parents talk to him while i sat there listening to music (secretly eavesdropping) it was hard to hear though so there's nothing else to say. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>Well the plane ride was long and boring. it was 3 1/2 hours long i think. or 4 hrs long. i dont know. but whichever it was, it was long. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>We flew into Chicago and there we had 45 min to wait at our other gate to fly to Raliegh. or however you spell it. so we boarded that plane and that flight was much shorter. i slept the whole time. i dont ever know why but i did. haha. when that flight was over it was like... 8:00 in North Carolina. well im wide awake. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>When we went to go rent a car we had some trouble. which is gay. the people were saying we couldn't get the car we had rented and we had to get another. but it wouldnt fit our luggage. so then they said that if we wanted a bigger one we had to pay $15 per day extra. so my dad started threatening to sue and stuff so we got the car. haha. but for $10 extra per day. which is still gay. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>In the car ride to my grandparents house (one hour long) emily and jon were really wild. it started to get annoying. so i listened to music the whole time and stared out the window. it started to get dark and i only saw one star. :'( tear tear. kinda depressing. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>Well now im at my grandparents house and im writing this entry for all of you guys back home. i really really miss you! and i will try and call you once i can find somewhere with a signal. which i cant right now so be patient. i miss you all and i love you! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>Please please comment because this might be the only way i can talk to you and myspace. please pray for the man we met on the plane, and for phillip's leg! haha. </FONT></STRONG></P>

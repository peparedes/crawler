"event","i am sick of people fucking judging me.  i had people at work calling me a ""thug"" and a ""psycho"" amongst other things.  what the fuck is that?  i mean, just because i look, walk, talk, etc... a certain way means that i fit into some kind of group/label/stereotype?  For instance, last night i was asked what i wanted to do with my life in a condescending tone because i asked for inmate clothing when he/she mentioned they had a friend that works at a pen. what is wrong with wanting inmate clothing?

i guess what i am trying to get as is that i love to prove people wrong and to fuck with thier minds.  our culture has labels and stereotypes for everything.  And all it takes is a visual or aural clue to set it off.  i dunno, i just confused myself, i don't even know what i am talking about anymore...  maybe i will sort it out some other time... for now it's bed =oD"

i thought i was so fucking smart
with these plans i had from the start
i thought i was so fucking smart
to use you then break your heart

time passed and i grew closer then i thought i would
i had feelings i wanted to share, but didn't know if i should
time passed and i grew closer then i knew i could
if i hadn't ruined things already, it's only a short time before i would

we had just met, but it's seemed like an eternity
i saw things in you, things only my soul could see
i didn't know where we were, but knew where we could be
i saw you trapped inside yourself, and thought i could set you free

but that's all over now, it's all been said and done
all we can do now it sit back and remember the fun
i didn't want it to happen, but my premeditation won
i went fucked things up again, before they had begun

so keep flying if you are one that got away
and consider yourself lucky, cuz not many ended that way
most i Put In My Pocket, to play with another day
i know it's not right, but i can not help things things i do or say"

"event","my fingernails are dirty cuz i rather dig in the crates
then stuff my fingers between the legs of some girl
i don't have a girlfriend, i don't go on dates
i would rather spend my time making the vinyl twirl
i don't know why it rhymes when i get this shit off my chest
it just comes out like that i guess
the one and only love of my life is music to which i am wed
i cut and cut and cut up tracks until the vinyl bleeds red


it's 330am and i can't seem to get a wink
i could really use a shower
cuz my balls itch and my pits stink
but that don't matter cuz i still can't sleep
right now the world is silent
but the road to bed is too steep
i stare at my eyelids and let my mind wander
maybe that's why i can't sleep
there is too much for me to ponder
if i thought it all through it would take forever
that's surprising for me
especially since i am so clever
that can't be right, there is no way i'm a one six five
i don't know why i dwell on that shit
when i should just be thankful i am alive
afterall it's only some gayass number
i don't take it as truth
because sometimes i can't even outthink a cucumber
i don't know why i wasted my time with that stupid fucking test
all i ever wanted to be was average
and now it's telling me i'm better then the rest
it's gotta be full of shit, i know it's not right
one six five
i am sick of that shit, it's so fucking trite


okay now i am tired
i think i can get some rest
sleep is one thing
that i can't do best

"event","so i left ryan's at 10 to go home and get some sleep for work tomorrow at 7am...
but instead of sleep, i decided to finally put that cd changer i got off tuna in.
talk about a serious audiophile, i was out there from like 1030 to now gettin that fucker in.
works like butta though.  and can't see no wires either.  i should open a damn shop and do this shit for a living.  i love to work on cars, especially car audio.
so on top of my new sony deck that plays mp3 cds (300 songs on one disc!!!) i also have a 10 disc changer.
all i need now is an amp to run to my highs and i will be done with the audio project.

then comes project rx7 (project P747 as Kenichi Yamamoto called it).  i am itching for something to do with the little free time from school and work (i am ready to throw the ""partying"" towel in for a car to work on).
working on cars takes my mind off cigarettes too.

fuck, this kinda is becoming a real ""journal"".  gotta make sure i don't type in it for the next week or so.  two days in a row!!! jeez.

anyways, today was fucking awesome.  got to work on time, finally fixed the broken window in my car [heroine addicts you are next up for deportation], and got the cd changer in!

""gotta say it was a good day"""

like my dream car that is just outta touch.
i have the money, the resources and the time,
but for some reason that is just not as much
as i need to make this thing happen.
i first need to find the fucking thing.
before i can even start to trick her out and fix her,
then give her a new coat to make her gleam.
i will get this beauty, that's for sure,
in her i will ride as a mother fucking king!!!
cruising up and down the streets
in my newly crowned queen.

so if you are the rx7 in my dreams
stop fucking teasing me

"event","So last night i was on my way home from Ryan's and i see this whore/hooker/prostitute/crackhead whatever you wanna call her on my block...
she used to be across high street a ways down more towards 4th, but i guess she migrated closer, into my neighbrohood.

so what should i do??  a crackhead/heroin addict slash hooker is invading my neighbrohood... call the cops?? on what evidence?  they couldn't do shit.  time to take the law into my own hands.

i flipped on my right blinker and pulled to the curb.  ""you need a ride?""  i asked.
without a word she opened the car door and got in.
i began to drive off and she muttered ""what can i do for ya?""
""well, first we gotta take a lil ride, then i will tell ya, i don't wanna do it near my neighbrohood in case neighbors or someone see""

so i drove down 5th, all the way to the highway, and got on 71 north.  this is when she began to get suspicious.
""where are we going""
""this might surprise you a bit, so if it does, stay calm, cuz there is nothing you can do anyways.""  i paused.
""i don't want you crackhead whore ass in my neighbrohood so i am removing you.""
""what?""
""yeah, the next time i see you on the west side of high street i will have a friend do the same thing i am doing""
""what are you doing"" i think she said, it was hard to understand her i think she was fucked up.
""well, i am gonna take you about 10miles past the outerbelt and kick you outta my car.  that should keep you outta my neighbrohood for a while.""
she was shocked.
i turned up the music and continued to cruise at 65mph for another good 5-10minutes till i reached what i thought felt like the end of the road.
my right blinker went on, i pulled over, unlocked the door, and sternly said ""now get the fuck outta my car""
not sure of any other option she had, she readily complied and exited the vechile.

the whole ride back i couldn't think of anthing but the astounding act of community service i just did.  i was happy with what i did to help clean up my neighbrohood.  and somehow i doubt i will see her back on the west side of high anytime in the near future.

see kids, drugs are bad.  mmmmkay?"

"event","so i went out to marysville for the weekend, this past weekend.  My phone was almost dead so i turned it off so i would have enough battery to make one phone call incase of an emergency.
i live with my 2 brothers... one a year older and one 2 years younger.  the latter just moved in about a week ago.
now that it's monday, and i am back in columbus and could get to my phone charger i plugged it in.  7 new messages.  each one was from a family member, all of the bitching at where i am and that they are about to file a missing persons report.
now the only thing i see i have done wrong here is my failure to let someone know where i was gonna be.  and that is not totally my own fault.  i mean it is... but the situation was understandable.  i use a cell phone, and those of you who do the same know that once you start using a cell phone you no longer know anyones number.  you rely on your phone to keep those for you.  so since my phone was dead.. i couldn't get any numbers to call them.  and the one number i did know... the home # to my parents house in chicago i couldn't call cuz i had know way of dialing long distance.
that just there said i explained to everyone who was bitching at me and they fail to see the situation as it was.  they were still bitching about what if something happened to me and whatnot.
well... i am not one to dwell on the past (obviously unlike them) so i told them ""well nothing did happen to me, i am home now, you know where i am.  i am sorry you got worried.  i now know that i have to keep the numbers written in my wallet in case a similar situation occurs.
now, the parent i want to be, the parent i think i will be would sit okay with that.  but not mine.  my mom kept going on about more bullshit on how i am 21 and need to start acting my age and being responsible.
well... tuff fucking shit!! i can't change the past 3 days!!! trust me, if i could, i would... but it is all said and done.  so get over it.  i apologized and explained on how i am going about seeing it is not going to happen again.  so shut the fuck up!!!!!! plz
and mom.... taking about how me and my older brother are acting like little kids playing games.  who is playing the games here?  i am the one to owned up to what i did wrong, apologized, explained how its not going to happen again, and you are the one who is still clinging to the incident.  GROW UP!!!!  it's over.  stop clinging to it like a child would do.

what go me the most was here saying ""i did not raise a child like this""
well fuck... last time i checked, you raised me, so that's a oxymoron if i ever heard one.  why can't you accept who i am/ who i turned out to be and learn to interact with me on an adult level.  you obviously don't understand me... so why not try to learn instead of bitching and moaning about something that cannot be changed.  let's look to the future instead of dwelling on the past.
you are my mother, i love you dearly, and if you want a phone call every time i am gonna be gone for more then a day, then fine... i will try to do that.  but personally, i see that as a kind of ridiculous request being that i am 21 years old.  do you call and tell your parents everywhere you are going?  does grandma get worried when she hasn't talked to you in 2 days?
i dunno, maybe your family works differntly then the way i work.  i don't expect to call everyone i know everyday and let them know what's goin on... i am not like that.  i don't talk about bullshit over the phone, never have never will.  i call when i have something important to say, when i have something to get off my chest, and if that is not good enough then i suppose i am not good enough for you.

i am fucking crying right now.  and instead of talking to someone i care about, i am pouring out my guts to a fucking webpage... how fucked up is taht?  obviously there is something wrong with our communication here.

why am i crying???  cuz all this shit about you worrying about me brought back memories of the cruise ship.  we were on a boat... where could i have gone....
you searched all over and couldn't find me, so you worried that i threw myself overboard???  WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT??  that really fucking hurt me mother... it hurt me bad.  it told me exactly what you thought of me.  you think i hate myself.
well that is not the case, i love myself more then anything in the world. so the only thing i can think of, which i pry to god isn't true.... is that you are the one who hates me... hates me to death.  you dislike me so much that you ""worried"" i threw myself overboard.  seems more to me like you were hoping i did so.  so you can be rid of me for the rest of your life.  if that is the case then fucking say so.  if it is not, then tell me what the fuck is wrong with me???

i don't see a god damn thing wrong with me... i am being myself, who the fuck else can i be?  i will not live my life being the person you want me to be.

i don't see how a mother who loves her child could think her child could commit suicide???  do you realize how fucked up that is??? and how much it hurts that child???

and i don't know what the deal with dad is...
he always snaps to your word that i don't even know who the real him is.  all he does is support you, never gives his own opnions, advice, or ideas on the matter.  he is just your puppet.  and if he is truely worrying about me... was it before or after you brought it up???  the worst thing you can do is get that shit into someones head, it is contagious and spreads like wild fire.

it's like supervisor at the zoo... we are hanging lights and he says ""don't fall""
why the fuck would you say that???? now i am worried about falling when before it wasn't even in my mind.
people need to know when to bite thier tongue when it comes to panic and worry.

i don't know what the fuck else to say.... i mean FUCK YOU for thinking i would throw myself of a ship
that is a TOTALLY FUCKED UP THOUGHT to have about your OWN SON.  don't take this the bad way, but maybe you need your head checked.

ohh and another thing i have to get off my chest.  the whole depression/anxiety shit is your fault.  instead of letting me be who i was when i was a kid you always made me worry about other people.  FUCK EVERYONE ELSE!!!!!!   who cares if the neighbors can here, fuck them.  who cares what other people will think, they are thier thoughts.  you can't go around pleasing everyone all the time.
sure enough when i moved out and was trying to make it on my own that is all i thought about....  your voice popped into my head saying ""what will they think""  or ""the neighbors can here"" or ""people are watching""
FUCK THEM, my life shouldn't have to be put on hold or stopped for them.  i shouldn't have to refrain from saying something because of them>..... FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  fuck em if they don't like it.

i really hope you find this and read this... since we can never converse like adults.  it is what i needed to say to you, but you say what you have to say and then hang up.... fuck it  i am done bending over backwords to try to please you.  it takes too much time and energy and still never wins you over."

"event","So being the nice guy i am... i decide to drive basement dan home at 1am so he doesn't have to walk.  As it turns out, when i return home there is no parking spots on the street due to ladies 80s night at skully's... 
""no big deal, happens every thursday"" i thought.
so i hang a right into the alley and procede to pull around to the parking lot in the rear.
Some fucktard parks his gay black dodge ram right in the entrance to the lot.  What an inconciderate fuck!!!  i mean... what the fuck was he thinking parking there?  when he pulled in, he had to have seen the cars parked in the lot, and that where he parked was the only way in and out...   could he really believe no one out of the 30+ people that park in that lot needed to get in and out of there... could he have thought no one but him would be up at 130am?????
this really pisses me off... how stupid and inconsiderate could a person be?  if there weren't 2 police officers within 10 yards of the truck patrolling the thunderpussy magnolia lot i would have slashed his tires... all four of the fuckers and feel absolutely no remorse.

just then i spotted the cam car phone number dangling from my rearview on the back of my parking pass.  
""this is were free nights and weekends come in handy"" i thought with a sheepish grin.
8 keypresses later a towtruck was on its way to get rid of the son of a bitch,. or so i thought.

10 minutes pass and now a little red car pulls up to the front of the truck, someone is trying to get out of the lot.  after no more then 30 secs, an attractive slender darkhaired female emerged from the drivers seat of the car.  she was wearing washed out jeans, and a short white t-shirt that just barely exposed her navel with a brown button up sweater ontop. Hurridly, i hopped out of the car and casualy walked over.

""i called a tow truck about 10minutes ago, so it should be here soon.""
""you trying to get in?"" she said back with a smile.
""yea, can you believe this inconsiderate asshole?""
""hell of a place to park huh?""
""sure is, i never would of thought of myself as someone to call a tow truck, but this is just ridiculous""
""yea, he deserves it, that is for sure""  she replied, rubbing her arms, trying to warm up as she headed back to the car.

20 minutes passed and still no tow truck.
""hmm, let's redial and see what the situation is""

""cam car towing""
""yes, i called about a towtruck for the skullys parking lot about 20 minutes ago and i was wondering what was going on with that?""
""oh yes, we no longer tow that lot""
""so you can't come tow the car that is blocking the entrance to my parking lot?""
""no, like i said, we no longer tow that lot, as of about 2 months now""
""so if someone parked in my driveway, would you come tow them away?""
""yes, but that is a different situation, you would be the property owner, and would have your consent to tow the vechile""
""but i own the space it is blocking the path to""
""yes, but not the property the vehicle is on, we need permission from the property owner to tow the vehicle""
""thanks, bye""

so now i had to track down the number to lakota investments, the owners of the property.  a quick call to 411 and i was in business.  but it wasn't that easy, at the number i got, there was no answer.  however, the 411 lady said that the address was a P.O. box so i knew it was a home number, or a cell phone or something.
""time to wake this fucker up""
about 12 calls of 5 rings before the voicemail box picked up and 10 minutes later i got an answer, he sounded pissed.
""hello, hello""
""yes, this is <my name> from <my address> and someone is parking on your lot right in the only path to get to my parking spot.  i tried to get it towed, but cam car won't tow it unless they have permission from the property owner, which is not me""
""you need to call 228-5547""
""who is that?""
""that's <company name> they are the property managers... they have one of those 24 hour things.""
""thanks, sorry for calling so late""

finally, some progress and a few button pushes later i had the 24 hour ""emergency"" number.  a lady who sounded very sleepy and/or preoccupied answered and took down the make, model, color, plate and location of the vehicle and assured me she would contact a towing company.  atlast, a resolution, i could finally rest!!!!!"

It has come to my attention that I never update. Dont screw at me, im just a lazy bugger. Anyway, thanks to Pand for reminding me.

Current Affairs: 
1) I fancy someone, hopeful of further news on that front tomorrow.
2) Coursework and Work Experience are a fucking pain. I dont even have any work experience ATM.
3) For those of you who dont know, I have a new PC. I broke the old one :S I was pressing the reset button with a leaky pen. Oh well..
4) I am going to see 36 Crazyfists on the 14th October. They truly rule.
5) Its sunday today, so i'll recount what happened today.

Well, i got up, put on my new dressing gown, which is well cool. Big and heavy and black. Then I went downstairs, was going to have some cereal, then refrained. I am addicted to coco shreddies. Then I watched some TV. Twas ok. Then I came on the PC for a while, listenin to music. Fun. Then, about lunchtime, I went to my Grandmas and planted a tree. The treehouse at my grandmas is rotting down. It is funny. We have to do something about that sometime... It could be really cool if we did it up. Oh well...
Then I came home, came on the comp again. I really love ---- --------- and got Mr. jonny anonymous to ask her friend Miss. X to find some stuff about her. Gah... Then I played trivial pursuit (20th Anniversary Edition) with my parents and kicked their asses for the 2nd evening in a row..

This has been a really shit day. I will update tomorrow, I always have more stuff to say on a weekday, probably cuz I get to talk to mates and observe retarded teachers' antics. Oh well...

Catch ya later Bill and Ted!
I mean... Guys.

"event","Evening, My Fart Smellows,

I am now about to recount to you the tales of my magical school day. Hold onto youre seats, you are about to embark on a tale of magic and mystery, wonderful delights are in store. blah blah blah, sarcasm sarcasm, blah blah, sarcasm.

Before school: Got up, went to school. The fun never stops! Then I bought some milkybar buttons, which was nice. Then I threw a few at some ducks (sorry ducks, I didnt actually hit you, but I am sorry!) and then we went into school. Unfortunately, to my delight, I sat in some bird shit! Wonderful. Erm.... Wandered around a bit then went to registration.

Registration: Its always shit, I dont know why I even put it.

Lesson 1: Physics with the cockney facker, finished my assessed practical AND did my german homework, with time to kick Johnny Wing to spare! It was this lesson that I realised I had sat in bird shit. Fun Fun Fun!

Lesson 2: German with Mr. Rae the pilot. He is very weird, and got very stressy, saying that he wanted complete silence for 2 minutes. But he started talking to people after 5 seconds. Oh well. Limes.

Break: Cant remember.... something about... oh yeah, sitting on a bench. Riveting.

Lesson 3: English, watched more of R + J... nuff said.

Lunch: More Sitting on a bench. And crowdsurfing along the benches. And something about fighting a yellow bush for some food. Thats probably the highlight of the day.

Lesson 4: PE- Cricket... We kicked ass (fielding), I didnt do much. Great.

Lesson 5: RS- Mr Howarth, the NOTHERN FOOKER, kept telling us the internet password was respondent, for about half an hour. It turned out it was respondents. Tit.
Then the firebell rang later on, so that was an adventure in itself :S
Then we came back and stuff. Woop de doo.

Then, I went home. Now its the weekend. WOOHOO!

So I hope you have enjoyed this riproaring rollercoaster ride that is my day.

Quote From Snatch
Some young Jewish boys are haning outside the doorway of Dooug The Head's Jewellers Shop:

Doug The Head: What are you doing here?
Random Jew: 'sa free country ain't it?  *spits*
Doug: Well it ain't a free shop, is it.     So FUCK OFF!

I love that.

You heard him, fuck off.


Only joking, have fun alla yous.

Beat Up Johnny Wing
Been To aMeRiCa
Been to Talton Owers
Pissed about in random places
Pissed people off
Stuff... etc...

Anyway, I thought i'd start with today, since I cant remember much. Now I know how much you have been looking forward to this, so listen tight my little.... ah fuck it, I cant be doing with all this random chit chat shit. So basically, in a nut shell, I will be updating regoolarlay from now on.

Today:

Before school- Random chit chat about some shit as usual. Recounted how I am going to die tonight since I pissed off Allan, (which I am so fucking sorry for dude, I really am!) and then went into school.
Registration- Random bollocks.
Lesson 1- RS- Downloaded some fonts, made rude impressions of Mr. Howarth asking John to suck his penis less hard. (only joking mate, you had to be there didnt ya :P)
Lesson 2- Engemelish- Watched the modern day Rod + Julez, which by the way is fucking weird, since its American, and tybalt is rather fucking slick. Gutted. NEwayz...
Break- Ate a cheese baguette. Cheesey :P:S (soz rhi, have you forgiven cheese yet?)
Lesson 3- CheMystery- had mrs ""london fackin' cabbie"" Darby for some reason... kept argueing with her that ""but  Mr Beaumont says.... etc"" and threw cheese at Johnny. And kicked him. And sellotaped his head. The magical wonders of sellotape.
Lunch- Hung around on some benches, eating yet ANOTHER cheese baguette. I think I have forfilled my cheese requirements this week. Wehey.
Registration- Got my report, so ahm majorly pissed off with ma teachers now. Not ONE A*-B predicted! I AM NOT A TARD! I WON THE INTERHOUSE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE QUIZ IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.... *ahem*....sorry... MR RAE, I AM ASHAMED OF YOU! I WORK MY ASS OFF! AS FOR INSUFFICIENT HOMEWORK AND NOT HANDING MY BOOK IN, ID DO BOTH IF YOU ASKED YOU FUCKING PILOT LOOKALIKE! *ahem* I am tres sorry you had to witness that.....
Lesson 4- IT- Spent most time setting up the command prompt for people to use net send, and sending messages. I got all ticks in excellent for ICT, yet predicted B-C! WHATS UP WITH THAT BRUCEY, YOU TART! woops.... sorry mate. Get a beard cut!
Finally, LESSON 5- Music- Did ensemble piece with John, we fucking kicked ass.. JB Wearmouth, IF I DO NOT GET AT LEAST A B FOR THAT PIECE, I WILL PERSONALLY FORCE FEED YOU SHATTERED GLASS WITH WEIGHT LOSS POWDER! YOU TART!

Cheers for listening to that all, I will update tomorrow.

"event","I went bowling which was great, I got two strikes. Mr Wearmouth was really twattish in music today, being well out of order to a load of people (lodge, lou, finch) but the lesson was funny...

Other than that, pretty uneventful to my recollection. Except the car journey to Dunstable with my mate Allan driving. The seat I was sitting on came off! Proper burned it down some long twisty roads.

later guys,

"event","First day back. Got to school. Everyone seemed cool but realy tired and cold. Rhi got in and ripped the piss, but s'ok, I know what I looked like. *cough*fucking terrible*cough*
;)

Then went into school, had crap lessons, but first 3 were doss lessons (PSR, Music and IT!) Which was nice. I hate Mr. Heather. He's alright but hes a bit of a spoon most of the time. Its not Matt's fault that he couldnt give a fuck about PSR!

Hmm. Mr. Rodgers for IT. Couldnt do anything cool. Never knew how much frontpage SUCKS...

Music was funny as... Mr. Wearmouth had his haircut! HES STILL NOT BALD!!
Hes an arse. He shouted CUM really loud, and shouted WELL YOU DO NOW! at Louisa. I think he has turettes. The twat.

so this is Captain Bowl-cut signing off.

So. Erm... Did my English today, I hope it will do well. Bloody Gulliver and his STUPID FECKING TRAVELS! ARSE!

"event","Half term is steadily drawing to a close, school is drawing nearer and the prospect of the boredom is frightening. But on the bright side, ill see ma mates (for those of you who didnt talk to me during the holidays, I am too lazy to go out. Half term is sleepy-time)

Flooded the kitchen today when water leaked out of the shower.
:S
The water went through a hole in the ceiling and straight in the toaster. Bugger. :S

Got a bollocking, and then came on the net.

Good day I guess, I liked it.

Hmm... School. :P

One thing, I CANT DECIDE TO WAKE UP AT 12!

oh well, later guys

"event","As you may know or not know, I had a journal on another site which will remain nameless (and crap) and ive decided to move here, where most of you people do this. So here it is. Ill start with today ok?

Hmm, not a bad day today, but all the days of holidays seem to run together into one lazy, boring blur. Better do something soon. (:[)

Now, today, was a special day in every boys life. Oh hang on a minute, it wasnt.
Got up, persuaded mum to watch snatch, watched it with her. If u havent seen this, you must. It chainsaws ass.

Erm, had some marmite on toast, but put too much on it so it gave me a bloody headache. (:())
Guess it serves me right. (:P)

Drank some lager, came on the net. Came off the net, went on PS1 (im so deprived)
Drank some more, came on the net again. That was my day.

I hope I find something to do for the other however many days there are left of half term (:S)

See ya later dudez!

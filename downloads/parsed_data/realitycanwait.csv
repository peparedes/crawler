I am pretty positive that I will change all my passwords again ><
<b>And now he is listening to my phone conversations.</b>
I just have to ask, <b>what the fuck did I ever do to you to deserve this shit?!</b>
I have not remourse anymore, I feel no guilt even though I can see how <b>cruel</b> I can be if I am hurt. He wants to listen to my phone calls?
<i>Fine.</i>
Then he can hear how bad I want to get the hell out of here, how I am going to Disneyland with Sean and not him, how I have two strapping men waiting for me in hawaii to show me a good time. He can listen to me <b>free</b>ly flirt with any man I please and to feel no remourse.
Look I am no angel, but I wish his friends could see both sides to the relationship, instead of chase making me out to be a cheating self centered whore.
God, it kills me how blind and stupid I was to all his bullshit.
Soon he will see I was the best girlfriend I could possibly be, but he just fucked that.</lj-cut>

"event","Each passing day I get more and more excited that I get to get out of this town, and move on to better things.

So I have been high out of my mind the past 2 days, which is a nice change. I am not going to smoke today, I rather get shit done. But my friends have hijacked my car!
No not really.
Someone slashed poor KC's tires! So I lent them my car to get home, get some rest (it was like 4am), and get some new tires. But the thing is it was only KC's car who got slashed.
So Walter is planing out scenarios,
<lj-cut text=""The Suspects"">
<b>1)</b> His needy girlfriend was looking for him, heard me and him talking and having a good time on the porch, flipped out, and did it.

<i>-or-</i>

<b>2)</b> It was chase, (and he is slightly convinced it was anthony, but I find that hard to swallow) who heard us, got all jealous anbd did it, which I would not be surprized. Except I am pretty damn sure chase doesn't know which car is KC's. But it would figure that he would not want me to have contact with someone as hot/attractive/nice/dropdeadgorgeous as KC even though I am pretty sure he was the one who did the dumping this time.
</lj-cut>

Anyways, I showed enough forgiveness last night when I let him sleep in MY bed on MY matress. I hope he gets used to the fucking floor. I don't care anymore, I offered to leave all my furniture here if he promised that he would just take it to my parents house after the lease (literaly 2 mins away) but he insisted no. 
So fuck him.
Take something nice that I am trying to do and spit on it.

Ugh.
I need to get laid."

<P>And let me tell you, he doesn't give two shits about them unless I am out with some friends, or if we fight. If I was like him and stayed at home abolishing all contact from the outside world, he would never find a need to see them. I guess on some level his friends should thank me for ripping his head off, because otherwise they would never see him. </P>
<P>But, <B>back to the point</B>... I think I am moving all my shit to my parent's house, that is if he doesnt ""forgive me"" but whatever. I am kinda hoping he wont because this shit has been going on for WAY too long. I just feel bad for taking the living room set from walk and caroline, but then again there is no way he is sleeping on my microfiber couches, because I am taking the bed too. He did not want to be civil with me, so right back at him.</P>

But otherwise, yesterday we finnaly took care of our touchups, and <b>oh my god.</b>
We had some clogged pores, looked like whiteheads, on our neak. Which is wierds since we BOTH got it. So we went in expecting Danny to just pop it with the needle and fill it up with ink.
Wrong.
He went over everything but the eyes.
I took the pain much better this time, but I still felt like I was going to throw up afterwards (ended up going to the restroom and drinking water and taking a breather.  
Good thing is that the black is MUCH darker than before, bad thing is I have to resist picking off the scabs and lotion it once more.

He also pierced Rachel's eyebrow, and removed my rook (thank god because I honestly thought I could never get it out) and replaced it with a smaller gauge horseshoe so I could take it out easier. I can already notice the hole healing around the horseshoe. Danny told me that it shouldn't of been pierced with a 10(+/-) gauge in the first place, expecialy in the cartlidge. Hopefully with this smaller gauge it will stop getting infected. 

Otherwise life is going well, even though I keep getting mixed feelings about leaving, so I am trying hard not to think about it. I noticed I am playing final fantasy online less.

I am glad that tonight I was sober.



Chase went out to eat @Dennys with my friends from highschool right? <b>my friends</b>, those who have been with me through thick and thin. The ones who helped me through some desperate times, and laughed with me through good times.
He is miserable.
I just want to tear my hair out in frustration, I mean, just hang out with them, laugh at a joke or two, and what does he do?
Clam up and twists the straw paper into a ring, or some kinda joke of a satanic symbol.
I take him home because OBVIOUSLY he doesn't want to go to the after party with us, and in the car I ask him:
<i>""Do you not like my friends?""</i>
and he goes on about some crap on how he can only take them in small doeses, or one at a time, and that they wern't mature enough for them.
Made a crak about them being 8 or something.
He is the one who plays fucking Super Smash Brothers, and watches anime.
Watches fucking cartoons.
And who's life consists of:
<u>1)video games.</u>
<i>escaping reality and the outside world through some fucking pixels.</i>

<u>2)Toilet papering.</u>
<i>Aren't you supposed to grow out of then when... you know... you hit peuberty?!</i>

<u>3)making reigndeers at x-mas hump.(and deflating those giant snomen</u>
<i>OoO der teh light deers are having teh sex! har har. lets vandalize someones x-mas spirit and take pictures!""</i>

<u>4)changing the ""god loves you"" signs at church lawns to say something profane.</u>
<i>ah, moching someones religion and humliating the church who tries to proivide a haven for those who need it.</i>


Ugh.
I mean sure, I find that shit funny. I mean he can do all of that and I will look forward to his stories and pictures, and laugh along with him. But it is NOT mature, so don't fucking call my friends immature because they have a couple inside jokes that YOU are not a part of.

It just disgusts me that something he knows that is important to me gets blown to shit.
I guess what I want, what I care about never matters...

Someone started talking directly to me telling me that love is unconditional, that it is a comprimise, and that after 4 years of her previous relationship she realized that she was just ""comfortable"" and ""compationet.""
She was preeching to the choir.
And she is right.
Chase is just comfortable with me, if i make one more big mistake with him, its over. No love, no forgiveness.
He could go to jail for murder and I would still love and care for him.

God this realization that I am so desperate to be loved is making me sick...

Chase was right, once I move to hawaii my stomach problems (related to stress) will go away, and I will be free once more.
Maybe find a guy who wants more in life than to just settle, than to just be comfortable. Someone who has the same thirst for more as I do.
Maybe I will find someone who doesn't want to change me, ever. Who will love me for all that I am. Unconditionaly.
the Good and the Bad.
Until I guess I will be like him and be ""comfortable"" with my current situation.
and I will wait for the day where I can go to hawaii and be free..."

I just hope they keep me to go about my buisness online and prolong the data entry.
Real work?
No thanks.
Well im getting paid 10 tax free bucks an hour to sit on my ass, which means i make 80 a day, for a month thats a 1600 paycheck. That is a nice chunk of change.
It kills me that it's money that really drives us, that forces us to succeed.
I don't know what I like more:
sitting on my ass playing video games,
or making a good amount of money again.
I guess it would be nice for chase and I to afford nice things again.

I just had a thought.

We can go to disneyland before I go, and actualy not have to worry about money! i mean maybe even stay the night in a nice hotel, just th two of us and a two day pass? Hmmm.
I'll bring that up to him and see what he says, lets do the math: 
(i hate this part)
$642 for rent, x2 for the two months that I will be here for the two of us
around $150 in bills (satalite, dsl, phone, gas and electric, sewage) between the two of us, max.
and our paychecks, determined for 1 1/2 months of work:
 $2480 for my paycheck alone. (IF i decide to work 5 days a week, 8am-5pm)
+$2400 apx. from Chase (if he works 30 hours a week, taxed, not including comission)
-$1584 for two months of living there, between the two of us.
=$3216 for us to spend on food, gas and luxuries for two months.
Wow.
Hmm, it is also a nice chunk of change to have for moving out...




This isn't looking two bad, this whole working thing...

So yeah my pregnant bitch of a boss fired me.
Because she thinks I deliberately defy her.
A bunch of BS.
I guess that she would like to flatter herself and think that I put that much thought into her.
bleh.
I hated that job.
But what sucks is I needed it.
Another slap in the face is that she gave my position to my best friend Caroline.
I don't blame caroline in the least, fuck she deserved it.
But still...
It gets under my skin.

So I am jobless with rent due and bills to pay.

I also got food poisoning awhile ago,
yeah that sucked.
Not really looking for a job cause i have come to terms that I much rather sit on my ass.
It is much easier to sleep all day than face the world out there full of rejection.
Example: I go to a sushi bar across the street and see that they are looking for a hostess, I am thinking ""wow it's not bad pay, really close to the house, and i can learn some japanese!""
Wrong.
Even though the woman there (owner's wife?) was very forthcoming about me turning in the application, introducing herself, and telling me what time she will call me.
I never got a call.
I dove by the restaurant only to see the the ""looking for a hostess"" sign taken down.
Is that rejection or what?
What a tease.

I am gunna apply at game stop, just for something.
Just until the lease is up.
something...

Yeah I have desided I am officialy going back to hawaii for college for a number of reasons.
No I can't really go to college here for a number of reasons, which I am not getting into because I have explained them so much my brain has become mush.
The only problem is:
Chase.
I love him so much, I want to be with him for the rest of my life.
But I know myself all too well.
Long distance relationship over a period of four years is NOT going to work.
I am a realist sorry.
Another number of reasons, and I am not getting into that... 
brain=mush
My dad is paying for everything: free ride.
Does he want to live in Hawaii rent free for four years or less?
No.

<b>My whole apartment situation:</b>
I was the one who was looking for an apartment, I was the one who was out there, and when me and Chase's time was running out to move, I was the one who found a place.
Me.
No one gave a fuck.
Everyone gave me these impossible guidelines.
""I want a nice place""
""I want to live close to Caroline so she can come see me whenever she wants."" (she moved in shortly after we did.)
""I want to pay less than 1200 a month.""
""I want a pony.""
I did my best to fufil those guidelines, within the short amount of time that I was given.
Do I get a thank you?
Do I get a single note of gratitude?
No.
6 months into the lease my roomate wants to move out because he is too busy spending his money on hydroplonic kits for his fucking pot plants. He is 30 years old, and wants to move into his Girlfriend's (who is more than 10 years younger than him, and also my best friend.) mothers house.
If he doesn't have money to spare then cancel your fucking Satalite TV. There. $40 back in your poket.
Does he?
No.
He goes behind my back and plans to screw Chase and me over.
There is only one person who could make his rent, that would not drive me insaine.
Steve.
But damnit, he has car payments until october, so he can't cover rent right now.
Jamie, his girlfriend, is also saving up for a car. So bad time for her too.
Did I mention the whole living room set, dining room set, and 90% of the kitchen is <i>mine</i>?
Does Walter respect that?
<b>No.</b>
He fucking acts like it's all his. That <i>he</i> bought it.
That because he and Carloine pay the same amount of rent me and Chase do, he has more right to use it all than me.
He uses my 10 lb bag of cat litter and 10 lb bag of cat food for both our cats.
I ask for him to pay for half.
Does he?
No.
He goes on a rampage about how I am trying to take money from him and blah blah blah. He also has the NERVE to suggest that I use HIS food and litter, and I mooch off HIM. Also goes on about how I don't take care of my cat.
That's none of your fucking buisness.
If I want to starve my cat I will as I please.
I see his little black fluffbal eat my catfood, and shit in my litter every god damn day.
When bills come around which are in Chase's name, it's the same story every day.
""I don't have the money.""
Bullshit.
I see him eating fast food, buying pot, new clothes, new shoes.
He just doesn't have money to spare to his starving roomates.
Fuck him.

I just want to dissapear off the face of the earth.
I just want to take my parent's offer and move to hawaii on their tab.
I just want to take chase with me and live in paradise.
Does he support me in the least?
""I can't move to Hawaii.""
All I hear is:
""I don't care about your dream to live there.""
""I don't care about your dream to go to college and become a writer.""
""I don't care that San Diego is slowly driving you insaine.""
I couldn't leave him behind...

Damed if I do, damned if I don't.

my 7 year old cousin [girl]...

the boy (introverted, REALLY sweet, fucked up child hood, almost died once, suffered GREAT abuse; physicly and sexualy from his mom's/my sister's boyfriend) will now either continue this because his father/my brother-in-law is in denial about this, or he will always find himself some sort of pervert and always carry this wieght on his shoulders.

the girl (outgoing, loving, accepting, popular) will now either sleep around because she feels she is dirty/has no self worth, or end up with somewhat suicidal tendincies and or a drug problem. 

No matter what, they will have some issues with sex. 
They will hate their cousin/family because of the issue. (girl's side against boy's side)
They will make bad choices because of it.
It will take alot of therapy to get over any of those issues.








This is why i do not belive in god.

 ANYWAYS i look pretty hot but no camera or anyone to appriciate it.
how depressing...

Chase is pissed cause I mentioned that I would appriciate if he didn't read this.
I mean this is like therapist for me.
A confessional booth.
And he is pissed because he isn't included in my every waking moment?

~.~

Jared called... he wanted to know if Rachel thought he was hot.
Doesn't he get that I don't want to set him up with my friends?
He <i>was</i> drunk...

"event","ok everyone can blame anthony for me updating. 

life is good.
It consists of:
Work at a small san diegan company called ""Chuao Chocoliatier,"" as a full time ""shift manager"" aka glorified cashier.
My nice apartment, with my caroline and her boyfriend, and my man <b>Chase</b>
 (a year and five months and I am still in love with him)
and Final Fantasy XI.

So what if I don't have a real life?!


I'll update more into detail later, my minion Kimberly is bitching that I am lazy.
Which I am.
But that is besides the point.

<b>""how did you get this nuber?""</b>
I am with a customer who just bought an <u>MVP card</u> off me ($4 comission), wants to <u>pre-order</u> Madden 05 ($1 comission), and just might be interested in a warranty, ($3 comission) so right now <b>he is my best friend</b>.

puta.
(puta= whore in espanoli)

"event","ok so about every other entry is gunna be friends only
yay
who gives a shit right?

so right now I am STILL going out with <b>Chase</b> for almost nine months strong.
been clean and <b>sober</b>
for him really... I guesss pot, shrooms, and E bothered him so much that eventually I got disguested with myself and up and quit without him asking.
I guess he filled the void that was previously there for my drugs.
You know you do that shit to be happy, and being with him I realize he makes me happy enough.
He IS my drug.
Though the fact he is, and will be in Maine for another 8 days isnt comforting... So i got drunk (for some reason he has no problem with that) for the first time since new years. 
Drunk right now...
Did i mention that I was living with him?
So yeah since im off in chasey-land I kinda miss my friends. I see matt but it doesnt seem like he cares about anyone else but his new older Gf. (who happens to be his little ""sister's"" bf's ex, wtf?) She is cool and everything but whatever, who the fuck am I to judge?
I am worried and wondering about Rachel... wondering what the fuck she is doing...
should proly read her dead journal and see wtf is up...
Yeah....
I wonder about Dan and Jared and Brandon, wanna im them and see how their lives are going, but the proly just see me as the annoying EX who wonder wtf is up.
The only ex i keep in contact now is steve.
We hang out every so often, and talk about drugs and sex, my two favorite topics btw.

ITs cool, even though chase gets bothered since steve IS an ex.
but he was a friend first and after, doesnt he get that?
oh well...
I guess i would feel the same way if he talked to his ex or hung out with her... i wish he could just meet him and see how cool he is...
but my versian oof a perfect world doesnt exist...
ignore me im drunk
-blah-
im gunna go play final fantasy XI and let it take over my life once again
damn mmorpgs"

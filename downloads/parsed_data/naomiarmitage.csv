Funny this is now the people who were at the root of this crap are working the evening shifts and we work the morning!

I was talking to J ( yes im codeing this lol ) that I ran into D & M. D forgot my name so M told him then I overheard M saying the she didnt think i would make it here...SOUND FAMILIAR???? J had a laugh at that then A laughed and said yea that sounds like M.  OHHH D was my old supervisor who is married w/ 3 kids and is sleeping w/ M. M got J fired by saying she called her something..J said it was BS but was fired anyway. I noticed our old place has an help wanted in the paper offering a $200 signing bonus. I laughed told J, she also laughed and said she doubts they will even honor it. I laughed and said yea your prolly right. 

Arent you glad i shared all of that. J and A both thought my firing (sp?) was BS but hey now we are all working together again w/ MUCH less drama so its all good.

The tech had trouble finding a good vein b/c I have small ones so she had to have help. ( bet you can see where this is going allready ) So the needle goes in everything seems fine till I get dizzy and the vein slows down. They lay me down, ask if  i still wanna donate I said yes, so they reposition the needle, which hurt! Then it starts going good again but I go pale and feel even more light headed/dizzy and the blood flow slows down again. The tech ended up pulling the line b/c she said it wasnt worth be getting any worse to donate :( I was upset/embarrassed/frustrated. Upset b/c I wasnt able to donate and they needed my blood type. Embarrssed b/c those who were in there donated where watching me I guess there was nothing else to do lol and frustrated b/c i had went through all that and they ended up tossing the bag since it wasnt full and couldnt use it. I got cheered up when a guy that was in there donating said "" that little girl is my hero"" I smiled and thought ""little gir?"" what am I  a 7yr old. I ended up staying an extra 45min or so b/c they wanted to keep an eye on me to make sure I was ok. Everyone kept asking me if i had ate/drank that day and the day b4 I said I had. I think what happen was I am on the end of my cycle and well you get the idea.  Spent the rest of the day tired/groogy w/ JB forceing water in me. Today my arm is swore but i am thinking i cant wait till June 1st so i can donate again lol! This was the 2nd time i had donated Jb goes all the time but i was Iffy b/c i have been anemic in the past, the tech said she was suprised I had passed my iron test b/c I looked pale when I came in. I thought nope I am naturly this white-- have very fair skin like most people w/ red hair.

BUT I did have a cute Alexander Moment wednesday that I just have to share. We took him to school he walked into his classroom and said "" this is my mommy"" everyone started smileing and laughing it was so great!"

I just started laughing I mean what point are you trying to make???

"event","is 8hrs of crappy dozing in a 48hr period bad? I hate my ""natural insomnia"", yea sure i'd love to just ""lay down"" and go to sleep but that doesnt work for me people... SO instead I stay awake playing World Of Warcrack trying to lvl up my honor kills (got 1000 ) ...OMG HOW LAME OF ME!!!!!!!! I'M BECOMING ONE OF THOSE GAMERS I USUALLY MAKE FUN OF!!!! Though I was pokeing fun of the "" leader"" of our raid for AV if you have no idea what that is...thats actually a good thing...I mean how do you loose AV when you are in the Horde's freaking base past their towers...and on your way to their gen...I KNOW I KNOW Abandon your base so they can march right in and take it!!!!!!!!!!! Then yell at me for ""backing up, running away"" Hello Nooblet...Huntes are RANGED!!!!! we dont run away/back up ANYWAYS...

SO back on topic yea I look like sh*t my eyes look like one of those High School stoners whose out of eye drops skin looks like hell i am shaking soooo much, my options...1. Take my meds and take a sleeping pill to bring me down 2. dont take meds and be all weird and non functional today...Given I have 3 kids and things to keep track of I choose option 1. SOmetimes being responable sucks...

OMG I have so say Dazed and Confused is one of my fav movies!!!!!! Seriously go rent it and rewatch...Milla looks hot as always has she even aged?  Yes I just said a chic was Hot as i said many time I refused to lable   my self as straight/bi I preferd to just say Im sexual. 

Hmm how many times can I go off topic...lets fine out...."

"event","I had to post this hilarious review dont by my buddy and very talented writer, Josh Pierce

The holes in The Village: 


Of all the places in the village, the one place where it is most likely that the floorboards will be pulled up is the Quiet Room. And that is exactly where one of the costumes is kept. 

When the Elders become the creatures and kill ALL OF THE ANIMALS, what, therefore, are they going to eat in the village? Wheat? A few animals being killed would be an adequate message. Or maybe, some other imaginative punishment. Perhaps the kidnapping of a villager? Or a        ? That would be compelling, scare the viewers, and reinforce the fright in the minds of the villagers. 

Adrien Brody, when in the costume chasing Ivy, stares off into nothing sideways, watches Ivy silently before moving, and he does this why? No reason, except to make it scary for the viewers. 

How can Noah so p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y replicate the exact same sounds of the red creatures as the actual red creatures? Is there a voice box? 

Ivy can see colors and can see reasonably well in the village AND in the woods, yet when leaving the reserve, she becomes absolutely blind and can't see the siren lights. Also, she's blind, and she can make it around the village with amazing ease and skill, and of course, this is over a grassy terrain with hills and dips. 

The one man who would notice that there were people in the reserve (Shyamalan's character) and probably be paid to keep quiet is completely oblivious. 

Without Luscius telling the Elders, how are they to know that the boundary line has been crossed? This is obviously the film's biggest hole and in fact negates any chance of the story holding any weight. 

What are the Elders doing in the woods, that Adrien Brody can see them doing? They can't be eating anything. They can't be         anything. And how can the Elders predict that Adrien Brody will go into the woods so that they can be ready to wait there for him to see them? 

There are no boundaries blocking out people who come into the reserve. And how would such a thing as that be explained, if someone did come by? Wouldn't William Hurt's character use his money to pay for more guards? 

Did they just run out of medicine or did they actually need it? If they ran out, okay, that's fine. If they never brought any... 

Explanations: 

The reason why they talked strange in the village (as if they lived in the 19th century) was to trick the viewer, and for no other reason. 

Inbreeding isn't a problem because of how many villagers there are. 

Ivy's father sent her to the towns even though she was blind because she wouldn't see anything. He probably did know there was a risk she could be hit by a car, abducted, or     d. 

Flaws in the movie The Village: 

There was no enough time given to the history/explanations of the village itself. 

Adrien Brody's character is a total joke. His acting is awful. 

The dialogue is laughably bad. Even if people did speak like that back then, it's still laughable today and can break the somber tone of the movie. 

There isn't adequate coverage given to      s other than the Elders. There is maybe one other       present in the movie (during the interrogation) who is not an Elder. Why? Is it a village of children? 

At the end, all of the      s standing up signaling to keep the village operating is cheesy beyond belief. 

The overabundance of the music kills any real emotion we may feel towards the characters. This is a mystery given that Shyamalan's past movies have been very quiet. 

The characters are all one-dimensional (and all the actors besides Brody give a one-tone, one dimensional somber performance), except perhaps this is a given for the children, who grew up in world of innocence, therefore they would be stupid and naive, but this wasn't given enough coverage for this to be a reasonable point. 
To Sum It Up: 

Truth be told, the most interesting concept in the movie is the premise, that the village was created in order to keep out the evils of the modern world and the creatures were devised to keep them from leaving, although that immediately makes the scares drop flat upon second viewing. It's a good sci-fi twilight zone concept, but the           is     -poor. The curious part? Why did he make the last twist (that the setting was the present) hints in the beginning and the middle of the movie? Why not leave it as a shocker? 

Moreover, why didn't he raise the point that keeping people in a constant state of fear is wrong? He made it seem like the village was a good idea that just went wrong because of a village idiot. 

Ah well, at least we have the trailer. 

The Village is the opposite of an M. Night Shyamalan movie. The twists are the best part. The rest is the mess."

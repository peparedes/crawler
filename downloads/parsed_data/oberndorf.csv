Normally, I'd rant about politics, or the state of the nation, or idiot drivers.  However, my current pet peeve involves something nearer to my heart.  Used book stores.

My favorite used book store closed years ago.  The owner was a slightly crazy old guy with more hair than an 80s metal band who would chat about the state of the book selling industry, discuss the quirks of authors, and occasionally simply forget to charge sales tax.  Actually, he reminds me of an older, hairier, male Rollick in a lot of ways.

So I've been making do with other places.  John King Used and Rare Books (only about 20 miles away via the Lodge) is, as always, something of a bibliophile's Mecca, except that it's overpriced and a bit of a drive.  Not to mention the parking lot's claustrophobic, and the fact that the fence is of necessity capped with barbed wire.  Still, I try to stop by every couple of months and bury myself in books that are in some cases older than this country.

There's a batch of places on Woodward, between 9 Mile and 13 Mile.  (I suppose I should add, for the benefit of the non-Detroiters out there, that the major east/west streets in the Detroit area occur every mile, and are numbered as such.  Sometimes they have names, but the numbers are used as distance markers.  Yeah, 8 Mile is an actual road, one mile south of 9 Mile.  Convenient, eh?)  Their selection isn't always great, but they usually have at least one or two interesting tomes kicking around.  Still, it's a half-hour plus drive out there, so I only stop in every couple of months at the most.

That pretty much leaves me with the Books Connection.  7 Mile and Middlebelt, and right next to my local comic shop.  It's only about 10 minutes away, too, which means I used to stop by pretty regularly.  The real kick, though, was that they used to have a good selection of gaming books, and at 10% off, they were a great deal.

Sadly, Books Connection's selection of gaming material has basically fallen apart.  They've failed to get anything new in the past six months, and despite my ordering books from the place months before the books hit the presses, they failed to carry the books for me.  Okay, they're on the low end of the book store food chain.  I can buy that.  

The next nail in their coffin happened a couple of weeks ago.  I walked up to the storefront about 3 minutes after closing time.  There were still customers browsing the shelves, and the ""open"" sign was still up.  As I reached my hand out to grab the handle, the shopkeeper locked the door in my face, and waved me off.  Now I know that they have the right to close at closing time, but the fact that they locked the door in the face of a potentially paying customer pissed me off.  Strike two.

The final nail was a pair of events, one this past summer, and one just yesterday.  This past summer, I cleaned out my closet.  Four shoeboxes full of novels I'd last read in the eighth grade went into my car, and down to the Books Connection.  I traded them in for a pittance of store credit.  When I questioned the tiny amount of credit, they informed my glibly that ""our landlord doesn't take books"".  Which is true, but he does take the money you get for selling my books to other people, yes?  Ah well, not such a big deal.  So I have something like $30 of store credit.

Yesterday, I stop by the Books Connection, and decided to pick up a used paperback that they were selling for three dollars and fifty cents.  $3.50.  I walk up to the counter, give them my account, and expect to walk out with the book.  What am I told?  I owe $2.58 for the book.  Excuse me, what?  When I questioned this, they repeated the same tired bromide.  ""Our landlord doesn't take books.""

I left (without buying the book, as it happens), mildly disappointed.  Then it hit me.  They used the same line when they didn't give me any credit in the first place.  They gimped me twice on the deal, giving me something like 10% of the resale price of my books, and then not letting me use my credit to cover the full cost of a book I wanted.  Strike three.

 I figure the next time I stop by, I'll request my credit either in books or in cash (because unlike their landlord, I do take books) and wash my hands of the bastards.  And through small increments (and the minuscule amount of shitty press I generate here) so dies another used bookstore.  For screwing me.

"event","Okay, look.  Everybody and their brother has heard about the John Kerry potential intern thing.  I heard about it a couple of days ago.

As I understand it, a lot of this mess started when Wes Clark made an off the record crack about, ""Kerry will implode over an intern issue.""  So already it's pretty suspect as a pure political attack.  So far, I haven't heard anything more than free-floating scandal-mongering about it.  Heck, the right wing news sources I check out are scrambling as hard as they can to be nowhere near the story, solemnly opining that they shouldn't touch this story with a ten-foot pole until it's more confirmed.

Okay, so looking at it, we have a tabloid-style smear.  Oh look, a Democratic politician (who sorta suspiciously has married two rich heiresses) has self-control issues.  At one level, after Big Bill, it's not that surprising.  On the other hand, can we please, please not blow this out of proportion?  So far as I can tell, there's nothing substantive there.  Sounds like a great deal of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Give it a rest, folks.  No sleazy scandal this time, I devoutly hope.  

About the best I can say, at this point, is that it's pretty obviously not a partisan smear.  I don't know where Wes got his little tidbit, and I really don't care.  The Republican side of the aisle has (from what I've seen, and I'm going to admit I'm not glued to the news channels) basically said: ""Hold on, this is a pretty tenuous allegation, let's not get bent out of shape about this just yet.""  So it looks from where I sit like an attempt to drum up a few more cover stories about the primary season after the competition is largely over.

Can we please wait for some proof, like maybe a statement from the woman in question, before we jump all over this?  Please?  End of rant."

"event","So on the strength of a discussion this weekend about good words to describe breasts, I had a line of thought.  I wish there was more censorship on TV.

Yeah, I know.  It makes me either a leftwing looney out to eliminate all sensible political discourse or an evil jackbooted fascist thug out to repress the artistes in Hollywood.

Except that I'm neither.  What I do think, thought, is that censorship would make both groups (and the consumers in the middle) a little happier.  Certainly, flatly forbidding, say, nudity and overtly sexual conversations, would make the Morality Police happy.  The fun thought I had, though, was that it would also save us from cheap sensationalism, (Look at my breast!  Aren't I naughty?  Please, talk about me some more, it makes people want to buy my CDs.) and force artists to be, well, creative.

Artists have been subtly subversive for ages.  The fresco behind the altar in the Sistine Chapel (by ""I'm not a painter, I'm a sculptor"" Michaelangelo) is a beautiful piece of work with a decidedly religious cast.  On the other hand, it has a decidedly political bent.  One of the guys depicted in Purgatory with asses' ears was in fact the papal accountant who tried to skip some payments to old Mikey.  The vast majority of the world thinks it's a beautiful, uplifting artistic treasure.  The people Michaelangelo was really talking to, however, get the joke.

That, I think, is really what bothers me about the cheap and bawdy crap on TV.  You don't have to think to get it.  Just quick, easy gratification.  If that route was forbidden, the writers (who presumably would still be interested in selling sex) would have to be clever about it.  Double entendre would come back in vogue.  We would get vague allusions, cryptic puns.  Writers would be forced to work at their craft.  The people tuning in for the lowbrow stuff would learn to make do with less tawdry entertainments, and the more clever folk would get not only (putatively) better programming but access to the clever gags concealing the T&A.

I don't know if it would work, but it would sure be interesting.  End of rant."

"event","So, a certain friend of mine with a certain color of hair has shamed me into updating.  

Anyway, I've been quiet because I've had a local panic about my master's thesis.  It's under control now, and life proceeds.  Hopefully, I'll get back into the swing of this.

At any rate, the Iowa caucuses have come and gone, and friend Howard has gone from serious (but angry) candidate to just plain loony (but still quite angry) candidate.  Now, I'm not terribly down on the scream.  It's a tradition where I went to college to have a big, campus-wide primal scream before finals week, so I'm kinda used to it.  I will say, though, that it sounded a lot like a put-on voice, like Howie was channeling Mel Blanc or something.

So off we go to New Hampshire, and sadly, my Democrat of choice (which is to say, my least painful result of choice) looks like it's going to be his last stand.  Ah, poor Joe Lieberman, we'll miss you.  As much as the guy was a lousy public speaker, he was still the only one that didn't sound like a slightly less hacked-off Howard Dean.  (Well, Sharpton and Gephardt didn't either, but Dick's gone, and Al is just doing this 'cause it's cool.)  Anyway, I have no idea how anybody would pick a candidate from this  field.  Seriously.  They don't seem all that different.

On the other hand, I suppose it's sort of a good thing.  After all, if there's one thing Dean was, it was the anti-Bush.  Now, I've not been a Bush fan for the past few weeks or so, starting with his damnfool medicare plan, and moving through his immigration policy.  (Dude, you're a Republican.  They're not supposed to spend that much money.  That's the whole point, really.)  Still, it's a refreshing change from the two parties splitting hairs between themselves.  Maybe a real choice for once.

Let's see. . .   The other thing I sorta want to talk about is the weather.  Yeah, I know.  The most boring topic on God's green earth.  Still, it's been kinda dramatic this year, have you noticed?

I'm pretty well known as a guy who likes the cold.  I don't wear anything but jeans and a t-shirt until I can see my breath, for example.  I've been lamenting for the past couple of years that all we've had are wimpy, autumnal winters.  Well, I finally got what I wanted.  It's bitter flaming cold, and we're actually getting more than a couple inches of snow.  Okay, so it's so crappy out that I have to miss a LARP that I try mightily to catch.  Small price to pay to have my bleeding seasons back, dammit.

Anyway, I'm going to maybe go and take a nap or something.  End of rant."

"event","So over the course of the holidays, I watched a little TV.  Real shocker, there, isn't it?

Anyway, after scrolling through ""Spike TV: The Network for Men"", ""The Man Show"", ""Movies for Guys who Like Movies"", and the like, I begin to wonder exactly what kind of man I am.  Sure, I like a pretty girl as much as the next guy, and I do enjoy a good action movie now and again, but I wasn't really into a whole lot of their stuff, which seemed a little sophomoric at the time.  All style and no substance, perhaps.

Anyway, having noticed this, I've also noticed a recent (to me) deluge of ""women's TV"".  WE, Oxygen, Lifetime. . .  All of these channels supposedly showing what women want to see on the idiot box.  So I'm forced to ask the ladies out there(not that I think I'll get a broad response or anything) what they think of this.  Are these channels, in fact, catering to a feminine television aesthetic?  Or are they just trying to carve out a niche for ""girly-girls"" the same way Spike is marketed at ""manly-men""?"

"event","So it's been awhile since the last angry screed.  Once again, bite me.

Anyway, the state of the world has changed pretty dramatically since last I vented my spleen here.  Primarily, the Big, Bad, Saddam is now a resident of the American Military Penal System.  So now that we've got him, what do we do with him?

First off, we interrogate the hell out of him.  I've heard WMD (I hate that term.  Biological weapons are deadly, but not destructive.  Anthrax won't put so much as a dent in my fender.) rumors in all directions, including a particularly good one about Saddam buying nukes and getting junk, and then being too embarrassed to admit it, but it would be nice to hear what the man himself has to say about this.  Plus, interrogation, even nice, gentle, American interrogation, is pretty harsh, and it'd be nice if we can dispel the rumors of ""Saddam Hussein, Neo-Saladin"" a little more with some TV photos of him in an 8x10 concrete hole.

Of course, once we've milked him dry of every possible tidbit of information, and paraded him to the world as a broken man, what do we do with him?  The obvious answer is to give him a trial.  Still, we have to ask where.

Ideally, once his mystique is eroded away by 24-7 CNN coverage of him badly needing a shave and shower, we could try his ass in Iraq.  After all, they've suffered under him, and thus have a right to kick his ass.  I've heard speculation that he might be able to weasel out of a guilty verdict through intimidation or bribery, but I tend to suspect that with the world watching, it will be rather hard to pull off.

I don't think that the US military (or civilian courts, for that matter) have any right to try him, since he's an Iraqi concern.  Especially since by letting the Iraqis have him we can make another dent in the rumor that were in Iraq to run the joint ourselves.  Let the locals handle it as a gesture of goodwill.

Those that think the ICC should have him are dim, drunk, or delusional, take your pick.  First, the ICC, by its own rules, doesn't have jurisdiction over most of the crimes he committed.  The deal is that the ICC can't try crimes committed before it was founded, and since it's only a couple years old, we'd miss most of his evil.

Second, the US (for a number of very good reasons, elaborated better than I can do elsewhere, I'll provide the link when I dig it up again) isn't involved in the ICC, and thus has no say.  You really want to give control of the trial over to people who had no involvement in the war, and in fact actively opposed removing him from power?  Didn't think so.

The third reason is pretty closely related.  The Iraqis bled to bring him to justice.  The British bled to bring him to justice.  The Poles bled. . .  And we bled.  Did the ICC?  Did France, Russia, or Germany?  Hell no.  So why should we let them handle it?    It's our business at this point, and if they don't like it, tough.

So now that we've interrogated, de-mythologized, and convicted the man, now what?  Imprisoning him seems almost trivial compared to the magnitude of his crimes.  Bloody hell, we tried to execute Goering, and if we could have caught them, we would have hung Hitler and Himmler.  Saddam is only less guilty because he was less powerful.  He, too, was a mass-murderer.  Only unlike Hitler, Saddam had the stones to do some of his own torture, maiming, and killing.

On the other hand, by killing him, we risk martyring him.  I think de-mythologizing him will help with that, as the Arab culture is largely a ""face"" culture.  With the loss of face he took being captured without firing a shot, he's not looking terribly martyr-like.  But even if he won't be a martyr, how do we go about killing him?

I think the best suggestion, by Kim DuToit (www.kimdutoit.com), was to release him into Kurdistan and let the Kurds have their way with him.  Sadly, it's not terribly well controlled, and the last thing we want to do is have somebody or other pissed off because they didn't get a whack at him.  So clearly there needs to be some sort of formal affair.  Firing squad?  No, that's a good, military death.  I think hanging, though, is an old classic we could all get behind.

I guess a hanging is as good a place as any to stop, so we'll call this the End of rant."

"event","So I haven't updated in forever.  Bite me.

Anyway, today was a day for local elections.  Being the good citizen that I am, I read through the candidates' propaganda yesterday, and skimmed the local paper's article on the topic.  Feeling duly informed, I went off to vote.

I went at about 10:45 in the morning, since I was done with my classes for the day.  I was the 23rd person to vote, out of about 3,000 in the precinct.  That's not so bad, I guess.  The polls don't open until 8, and that might not be early enough for people to vote before work.

On the other hand, the poll workers freaked out when I showed up.  They acted as if they'd never seen a twentysomething male before.  I heard from a friend that I was the youngest person to vote there today.  Apparently by a wide margin.

On the surface, it doesn't really bother me that young people don't vote.  They usually don't bother to inform themselves about the election.  Even when they do, a lot of it seems to be the biased drivel one hears in political ads, not exactly the basis for an informed decision.  So the fact that they're not casting ignorant votes doesn't bother me a lick.

What does bother me, and deeply, is that people my age don't bother being well-informed.  Partially it's because I think that eligible voters have an obligation to vote, and vote wisely at that.  It's a civic duty.  That alone is reason to be righteously pissed off about the situation.

The other problem is that since none of my demographic votes, politicians don't work for us.  They push for benefits for senior citizens, since they all vote.  They push for trendy interest groups (entrepreneurs, homosexuals, minorities, school teachers, union workers) since they have PACs.  Nobody panders to the teenage vote.  (Which, my bitching aside, is probably a good thing, when you get right down to it.)

So come on you bleeding slackers.  It takes fifteen minutes to read the paper, and a half an hour to vote.  It's really not that hard, and you feel good about yourself afterward.  Easiest thing on earth.  End of rant.

Edit:  The local paper informs me that roughly 10,000 people voted.  In a community of over 80,000 total people (including ineligible voters).  Sad."

Personally, I think we have about 6 Indians too many, if only because at this rate they're debating with sound bites, and the one with the best one-liner wins.  So who do I think should drop out?  I'm so glad you asked.

Carol Moseley-Braun:  I'm sorry, Senator, but you have no money, no coverage, and not much of an organization.  This seems to be a big ego trip for you, and you don't seem to be adding anything to the mix.  I don't really care that you're a woman, or that you're black, it doesn't add to the discussion if you sit there and spout the same as all the rest.  Plus, you're barely registering in the polls.  Bow out, and endorse somebody so your two or three supporters will have an impact.

Wesley Clark:  Wes, buddy, you're done.  You were a media flash in a crowded pan, and the media doesn't care anymore.  You flipped and flopped more than the steak I had for dinner on the Iraq war, and since that's supposedly your strong point, I think you've about had it.  By the by, Wes, wasn't the war you commanded waged without UN approval?

Dennis Kucinich:  Denny, you're such an unknown I had to look up the spelling of your name (which is a pretty cool name, incidentally).  Nobody cares anymore, Dennis.  Go home.

Al Sharpton:  Al, you've achieved the near-impossible so far.  By keeping your mouth shut, I've almost forgotten that you're a demagogic, race-baiting anti-Semite that shouldn't be allowed within ICBM range of the Presidency.  But you did make a point a few weeks back, saying that the Democratic Party treats the black vote like an ugly prom date.  Do something radical, pull out, and throw your support to a third party candidate.  Make the Democrats work for the near 80% of the black vote that they get for a change.  Otherwise, this is just going to be a backrub for your ego.  Sorry al.

Dick Gephardt:  Dick, I think I feel more sorry for you than anybody else in the race.  You've been a loyal Democrat for years, running the Senate, and generally being something of a go-to boy for the party.  Sadly, you're just not sexy enough to get the nod.  Really a shame, since in the Republican party you'd have paid enough dues to get at least a sacrificial run like old Bob Dole.  Still, Dick,you're ash.  Give it up.

John Edwards:  Look Johnny, if Dick Gephardt can't get it, and Bob Graham was honest enough to admit he was done, you should too.  Your ""Bill Clinton II"" routine might have worked if you were a governor, and if you weren't so forgettable.  Sorry.

That leaves us with Dean, Kerry, and Lieberman.  I'm keeping Kerry around just as a third guy, because he seems the least pathetic.  Really, I think this is between Dean and Lieberman.  Sadly, I haven't heard Dean say anything really interesting policy-wise other than ""I will undo everything George Bush did"", which isn't really a policy, and isn't going to happen and you know it.  (Like anybody is going to win campaigning to raise taxes.)  Lieberman, who is my personal pick of the field, looks a little sick next to old Dean, though, so we'll see if energizing the party fringe can beat appealing to the wide middle ground.

To be fair, next November I'll be voting for George, since as little as I like him, I like him better than any of these guys.  Still, I'm thinking about voting for Joe in the open primary.

"event","Okay, that's a horrible, horrible misnomer.  Still, I spent the weekend watching movies with my mom, since it was her birthday.  We caught The Princess Bride, Young Frankenstein, and Animal House.  All three are wonderful movies in their own right, but a little schizophrenic when put together.

Still, I finally noticed something in Animal House that I'd never noticed before, and suddenly a scene made a lot more sense.  Y'see, at the beginning, Flounder and Pinto are touring the various fraternities.  They head to Omega house, home of the upper-class preppies and pretty-boys.  There, these two losers are quickly bounced to the reject couch.  Care to guess who's on it?  An East Indian, and Arab (I believe), a nerd, and a blind guy in a wheelchair.

Now, as a kid, I never got that scene.  It finally struck me that the foreigners were on the reject couch because they weren't white.  Mind you, there weren't any other non-whites in the movie. (Other than Otis Day and the Knights, which was another joke in and of itself.)  When I was a small child, I saw the impressive multi-cultural couch, and wondered why the losers were shunted in with the sure-fire pledges.

Now, I'm not suggesting that we turn back the clock to the days when pretty white boys excluded ""those brown people"" on principle.  That would be abhorrent.  On the other hand, what kind of world is it where kids automatically assume that minorities are sure-fire winners?  It's not like Hoover would have gotten into Omega house, and he was whiter than me.  Why is it that as a small child I saw colored skin and automatically assumed winner?  That's some pretty awful stereotyping, there.

I think that's part of the problem lately.  Martin Luther King spoke of a world where his children would be judged ""not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.""  I can get behind that.  Heck, I'm a huge booster of meritocracy.  So why are we granting special treatment to people based on the color of their skin?

Actually, that's probably not correct.  People are getting special treatment based on who their parents were.  And I think that's a far more horrible thing.  One of the major principles this country was built around was that it didn't matter who your parents were; there would be no aristocracy in our new nation.  Joshua Chamberlain, Union commander at Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg put it this way: ""This is free ground.  All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean.  No man has to bow.  No man born to royalty.  Here we judge you by what you do, not by what your father was.""

I'm attached to that notion.  I consider it pretty essential to the American system.  So where do we get off giving rewards to people based on who their parents were?  On what may have happened to them?

I'm sure somebody's going to bring up the three-fifths clause.  ""Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.""  (Article I, section 2)  

This is famously interpreted to mean that the Founders considered a slave (and therefore a black person) only 3/5 of a person.  This interpretation is wrong.  Very wrong.  Flat wrong, in fact.  The clause was intended to minimize the political power of the slave states, preventing them from counting their slaves (who could not vote) for purposes of getting Representatives in Congress and electors in the Electoral College.

I've digressed from my original point, but I'll just sum up.  Dammit, people are people.  If you're not a felon and you're not a genius, you should have the same chances under law anybody gets.  No special treatment, no free shots.  End of rant."

I suppose I could write about Rush Limbaugh and his drug problem, but let's face it.  When the fat man gets back, we'll hear all about it, ad nauseum, from him.  Why should I pre-empt it?  Besides, he's some rich talking head addicted to drugs.  So what else is news?  I suspect I could walk onto any movie set I chose, close my eyes, point, and hit a drug addict.

I could discuss the Rumsfeld memo, I guess.  Mr. Gung-ho, all is well having private doubts about how well all is.  Again, no real surprise.  He's got to simultaneously orchestrate a war, and sell it to the populace.  So on one end he's got to be an ad man, and on the other, he can't afford to miss a single trick.  This whole deal is about what I'd expect.

I could talk about the Iraq situation in general too.  Interesting to note that in WWII, we could lose more troops in a day than we've lost since 9/11.  (Very particular days, but the fact is the same.)  Apparently, most Iraqis have power again, at least those that had it before the war.  Also apparently, other than the shooting of GIs by Saddam loyalists, Iraq is pretty peaceful.  At least as peaceful as the rest of the region, which isn't really saying much.

I could talk about Israel.  No really, I could.  I feel the best solution is to make Muslims second-class citizens, to herd them out of Israel, and to randomly brutalize and attack them.  Then, when Israel's Muslims were being treated as badly as the rest of the region treats their Jews and Christians, then maybe Yassir would have something to bitch about.

Failing that, since 74% of Palestinians don't think suicide bombings that kill Jews are acts of terrorism, let the Israelis show the Palestinians what terror is really all about.  Let's drag them from their homes, pack them into rail cars, ship them for hundreds of miles, strip them, pack them so tightly into warehouses that there's no room to move, and gas them to death.  All of them.  That's terror.  

What, don't like that?  Then how 'bout for every Israeli killed by a suicide bomber, the Israelis flatten a Palestinian block.  They don't even have to kill anybody.  Pure property damage.  So eventually the Palestinians will begin to starve.  Sounds like a good incentive for them to move somewhere else.  Maybe someplace where they can be on the Knesset.  Oh wait, that's Israel.  My bad.  Then they should hie themselves off to Jordan.  Or Saudi Arabia.  Or Egypt.  Or one of those other Arabic paradises.  Hell, the Jews learned the trick of moving around, and if these people who ""rule the world by proxy"" can do it and make it work for them, why can't you?  (Quote from Mahathir Mohamad, President of Malaysia)

You know, there's just no good way to defuse the situation.  Personally, I think Israel should fight back.  Hard.  The only way this is going to stop is either when Israel completely surrenders (God forbid) or when they administer sufficient violence to the right people so that nobody particularly wants to fight with them anymore.

"event","Normally, I treat the local news the way most people treat Jerry Springer.  You watch and learn what idiots need to get the ""point and laugh"" treatment tonight.  Local 7 (WXYZ, best call letters in the business) is usually one of the worst, with ""consumer advocates"" who hassle people who didn't perform services they weren't paid for, on behalf of semi-literate morons.  Tonight was a whopper, though.

We got a look at the Detroit Public Schools headquarters.  Apparently, Channel 7 had trouble getting in to film the place because it was ""a security risk"".  Like people have nothing better to do than blow up school administrators.  How 'bout the GM headquarters, directly across the river from Canada?  No?  How 'bout the Federal courthouse, only about a mile away?

Stonewalling and obfuscating aside, these guys are seriously fucked up.  In a district that doesn't have enough books, the Board of Education spent over 3 million dollars refurnishing their office.  What these people need with expensive (and I mean expensive, this was quality stuff) cubicle partitions, LCD computer monitors, and apparently top-of-the-line Macs (I didn't get a good look at them) I don't know.  Come to think, why did they pay over $1.5 million on rent this past year?  Surely one could get cheaper rent elsewhere in the city.  Of course, then you wouldn't get all the window offices, but hey, you're civil servants.

I think this is more fuel for my contention that most government employees shouldn't get pensions, with the exceptions of fire, police, military, and possibly teachers/professors at public schools.  But not pencil pushers and bureaucrats.  If nothing else, we'd hopefully get enough turnover to keep the bureaucracy from ossifying behind make-work, cronyism, and nepotism.

Of course, in this town, that'd just mean everything would take twice as long while the new guy figured out what forms he needed to fill out to get the forms you need to fill out to get service.  I've been there, and I'm not kidding.  

Hell with it.  Line 'em up and shoot 'em.  Try to get more than one guy per bullet if you can.  End of rant."

Oh sure, I have to drive in the snow, and I hate it.  I have to shovel the snow, and don't care much for that either.  But I don't feel like the air outside is a fat man, sitting on me, and I don't break out sweating doing nothing but sitting quietly in the shade.  

Also, the cold really should cut down on the spiders around here.  I mean, I like them and all, but when I pass through a spider web on my way to the toilet I think things have gone a little too far.  I don't know where all the little buggers have come from lately.

I have to admit, though, that I really like the winter around here.  I like being inside, bundled up, on a grey, rainy day.  I like feeling the wind cut through me like a knife.  I really enjoy making fun of the people bundled up on even the mildest days.  There's nothing like a chill winter's day with the thin sunlight streaming down, even if I have to rinse my windshield off every couple miles because of all the road salt.

I think my only real problem with the winter is that all the local mammals try to sneak into the house.  We had a mouse (or two, I don't really know) in the ceiling a week or so ago.  We left some fun food for them, and they died.  The trouble is, we tried to find them, and failed miserably.  So up until last Friday or so, I could smell the little buggers decomposing somewhere nearby.

These are all minor quibbles, though.  Suffice to say that after a good weekend, and a good fall/winter day, I'm in a good mood."

"event","I spent the past weekend in Chicago catching up with old friends, meeting new people, and engaging in conspiracy and merriment.  Part of that merriment involved running through a friend's collection of old Nintendo games.  As the list of games scrolled by, the people assembled in the room shouted out praise and damnation of the games that caught our eyes.  Most of the games that caught our eye wound up getting played, at least until we got killed off.

Good games, like 1943, TMNT 2, Duck Tales, and Street Fighter, and bad games, like Punisher and Ikari Warriors.  Hell, we even dug up a copy of Custer's Revenge.  Something tells me about half of the people my age recognized at least one, and probably more than one.  It was good reminiscing about the old days.  We had stories about it, laughed at each other's choices, the whole deal.

I've seen behavior like that before.  Of course, that behavior was my dad and his brother, at the Ford Centennial, or him and his brothers-in-law at the Detroit Auto Show.  A bunch of guys looking at things that reminded them of their youth, remembering old times, soaking in the misty warmth of nostalgia.  

So these guys are remembering ""the good old days"" when they were 16-20, cruising up and down Telegraph, getting burgers, and dating women, plural.  My friends and I were remembering ""the good old days"" when we were 7-13, cruising up and down the block, getting Frosted Flakes, and fearing cooties.  Why is it that the same golden aura surrounds such different periods in our lives?  It's not like my dad couldn't relish neighborhood baseball, or causing trouble in high school.  Why are my golden age memories of 8 bits and his of 8 cylinders?

I occasionally feel guilty about playing video games and watching cartoons (okay, mostly anime, but I don't think the Powerpuff Girls or Samurai Jack count) in my 20s.  I've never felt quite this guilty about it before, though.  I don't know why my generation clings to its youth with such vigor, but I'd sure like to find out.

On the other hand, I wonder if I'll still be remembering those games in 30 years, or if I'll be remembering road trips to Chicago and grad school instead.  End of rant."

"event","Before I get into my topic of the day, I'll apologize for tomorrow.  I'll be on the road most of the day, and thus won't be posting.

Anyway, I've been thinking about racism.  It strikes me that it's a horribly misused word.  For example, when was the last time you heard about an Asian being racist?  Or a Hispanic?  I've only heard white people called racists.  That sounds pretty unusual, doesn't it?

Let's take a look at ""racial profiling"", everybody's hot-button issue.  If one knows that the local criminals (or terrorists) overwhelmingly fit a given profile, why not give people who fit that profile the once-over?  Sure it's hard on the innocent members of that group, but hey.  I've been accused of being a racist on account of my skin before, welcome to the great mass of falsely accused.  Decent cops, who are trying to catch criminals, will just let you go once they're satisfied.  Remember, Rodney King wouldn't have gotten beaten if he hadn't tried to pick a fight with the cops.

As a white guy applying for graduate school, I encounter a brand of racism myself.  Half of the schools I apply to want a 2x2 picture.  Now, unless they're practitioners of the dartboard school of decision, they don't need to know what I look like to grant me an interview.  Or unless they want to know about the color of my skin.  As the University of Michigan proved, race matters in admission.  If you're white or Asian, you become a low profile, and have to reach a higher standard than a black person.

(Incidentally, why can't we just stick with the term ""black""?  African-American bothers me, partially because it's so long-winded.  Or can I call myself a German-Polish-American, and cry when people don't use the proper term to refer to me?)

Recently, the best idea I've heard on the topic died in California.  Proposal 54 was supposed to eliminate the collection of racial data by the state government, with exceptions for health statistics. (I worked with a gentleman doing a survey of the causes of MS in blacks vs. the normal population.  He only had 13 cases last I heard, but he was working on it.)  That's probably the best way to get rid of racism, whether it's of the hood-and-cross variety or the checkbox variety.  Simply don't care.  

If, as everybody says, race doesn't matter, then why do we keep asking about it?  I know that stereotypes have positive effects, (assuming that, for example, gentlemen in turbans don't drink, saves a hassle when you offer them wine.) but that's only on a personal, individual level.  Further, the only time I want to hear ""a black man"" or ""a white woman"" or ""Hispanics"" is when somebody asks me: ""Do you know the name of that woman over there?  The Indian one?""

Let's just stop drawing attention to it.  Once we do, people will stop assigning meaning to it, and we can get on with our lives.

Oddly enough, the first few things that inevitably come to mind are traffic-related.  Since I already covered that topic awhile ago, I keep rejecting them as unsuitable, or at least redundant.

Eventually, enough other stuff got off my mind that I began to question why traffic keeps occurring to me.  I've somehow acquired a rep among my friends as a car guy, for no apparent reason.  Coming from Detroit does not burn automobiles into your brain.  Then it hit me.  Really, our only contact with ""the populace"" happens in cars.

Think about it.  The stereotypical ""normal Joe"" wakes up, shaves, showers, and hits the road.  He drives for some length of time (I would guess between 20 and 60 minutes offhand) and then gets to work.  He works with pretty much the same 5-10 people all day, possibly getting some input from the radio, and then gets back in his car and drives home.  Maybe he sees a movie or goes out to eat, but even then he's dealing with a fairly narrowly prescribed section of the general populace.  (Check how many people actually saw that last flick, or ate at that joint down the street.)  Then Joe eats something, watches possibly some TV, and goes to bed.

No contact with the unfiltered masses, except on those two automotive stretches.  So the vast majority of strangers you meet are on the roads.  Making it worse, we (or at least I) characterize the people I meet by the way they drive.  Crazy old ladies, drunk guys, jerks on cell phones. . .  So you get to meet an unfiltered cross section of society every day.  That may be why my drivetime is so central to my thoughts.

"event","As is probably well-known, I'm in the process of applying to medical school.  This means that I have to write essays on essays.  Essays for the initial general application, essays for the MCAT, and essays for the secondary applications unique to each school.  All this is, hopefully, topped off by an interview with one or more members of each school's admissions committee.

This compels me to ask why.  Clearly, from the AMCAS essay, they should be aware if the applicant has a reasonable grasp of the written english language.  In fact, it should be pretty apparent from the multiple-choice Verbal section of the MCAT.  I put the MCAT essay down to a desire to stress the applicants and check their performance, but that's just me.  This final batch of essays, though, astounds me.  Mainly, I suppose, because the secondary applications otherwise seem to be a recapitulation of the general application that they all received.  My name, address, GPA, and the like.  The only new things they seem to ask for are a check (well, that's a scam, but I expect it), my letters of recommendation (that's reasonable), any alumni or employees I'm related to (also reasonable), and the essays.

So they're actually going to read these things?  U of Chicago requests four of them.  That's a fair deal of reading by people who undoubtedly have other things to do.  It seems an awful lot of work on their part, for not a lot of gain.  The interview is, in theory, going to test my verbal fitness, as well an any intangible sense that I'm either the second coming of Dr. Schweitzer or a closet child-molester.  So what's the deal with the essay?

It's not like the essays are any particularly interesting questions, either.  ""Discuss a crisis you have been a part of,"" ""Why did you choose to go into medicine,"" ""Discuss the foundation of your value system,""  These are all pretty bland questions, and they've got to get a lot of the same answers.  Although I will admit to a tiny voice begging me to repeat Hugh Gallagher's joke and just mess with these people, I suspect it would be much harder on me than it was on Hugh (who got into NYU with his spectacular chutzpah).

Making it more acute, I actually got an application (from Drexel University) that didn't ask for any essays.  Drexel's the only one, though.  So clearly it's not mandatory.  Maybe Drexel's just a little more honest, and doesn't feel the need to lie to me about these stupid essays.

It's not that these essays are going to keep me from applying, either.  I just don't see why they go to all the trouble of asking for them (and either the bandwidth of transmitting them or the hassle of hauling in the envelopes).  Ah well, that's why they're on an admission's committee and I'm not.  End of rant."

"event","It probably doesn't surprise most of you, but I'm not a big fan of the French.  Their language grates, their cooking is vastly overrated, their hygiene is appalling, and their manners are terrible.  This is not, by the way, a stereotyped generalization.  The Frenchmen I've met hold pretty closely to most, if not all, of the above categories.

So it was with some degree of pleasure that I read an article in the <i>Guardian</i>, here:  http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1061130,00.html

I would make that an active link, but my limited html knowledge doesn't allow me to.  To summarize the article, a chunk of the French literary elite are beginning to think that France is in decline, not least of which because, in the words of Romain Gubert and Emmanuel Saint-Martin, ""'With our sermons, our empty gestures and our poetic flights, we [the French] have pissed off the planet. Worse: we make them laugh. ""

Okay, it's all well and good to pick on the French.  But I think they're exaggerating just a little.  Sure, their economy makes ours look Edenic.  Sure they have labor unrest that just won't quit.  Sure, the Froggies are protesting their imminent loss of a 35 hour work week.  But they're not the only ones with troubles.  

Anybody, anywhere, that I ask, will say his country's going down the tubes.  They'll have a laundry list of dumb, immoral, possibly illegal things their government is doing, and they'll be right on about half of them.  This is true whether I ask an Iraqi about the American occupation, or an Israeli about Sharon, a Russian about Putin, or even a Roman about Claudius.  You'll note, here, that despite the universality of complaints, there isn't a sense of the imminent destruction of civilization and the nation-state.

I have limitless faith in the French ability to screw things up.  They've been doing it for years.  Even they, however, aren't going to go the way of Ur, Babylon, Rome, Carthage, or Timbuktu any time soon.  Relax Froggies, the sky isn't falling.

"event","So I read in the news today that the German populace is divided on the notion of Governor Arnold.  Some of them seem to be saying that his plain style and forceful manner are just what Germany needs.  The rest of them are reminding folks what happened the last time an Austrian mobilized popular support in Germany with plain talk.  On the whole, I think it's overblown.  See also my last commentary on comparing people to Hitler.

Now that the recall is over, there's really no single story captivating the country.  Fox and CNN must be crying in their beer.  The Drudge Report leads with Rush Limbaugh going into therapy for a painkiller addiction.  Fair enough.  Get thine ass to rehab, Mr. Limbaugh, and stop being an addict.  I feel compelled to say something positive about Rush, but I really find it hard.  I used to listen to him, until he became almost a parody of himself.  Maybe this will be a wakeup call for the man, maybe not.  Either way, not exactly a world-shaking story in my opinion.

Closer to home, the Detroit News leads with a story saying the economy is getting better.  I'd be far more encouraged by this news if the paper hadn't spent the last week or so waffling on whether the UAW was doing well, or doing poorly.  My cousin, who's been in the UAW for years and whose parents are devoted and committed union supporters, has been sending my father (and by the miracle of forwarding, me) screeds on how the union keeps trying to take a bigger and bigger bite from the workers, while not delivering the goods to the workers.  Of course, my cousin may be a bit biased since Daimler Chrysler is on the skids.  I could go on a rant here about what Mercedes has done to Chrysler, but I'll let it rest for now.

All this brings to mind, however, the basic flaw of modern telejournalism.  Accusations fly back and forth about liberal bias (of which there is plenty) and conservative bias (of which there is a small but growing amount).  Personally, I take everything I see on the TV news with more salt than I take on my french fries, but then I'm a nasty, mistrustful cynic.

The problem is that there's so much time devoted to news, and so little real news involved.  This leaves CNN and Fox like the bored college student, anxiously checking his e-mail every third minute, and reading the profiles on his Buddy List in the meanwhile.  Sure, there's a lot happening in the world, but it all happens at its own pace.  The events of the day don't time themselves around commercial breaks and commentary segments.  So somebody's got to fill the time.

What winds up happening, is the talking heads on TV let fly with whatever's on their minds.  I suppose that's not so bad, but this is supposed to be <i>news</i>, not ""whatever my blow-dried brain can spit out.""  Even so, it wouldn't be so bad if they could draw a clear line between their opinions and their facts.  Trouble is, they can't seem to do that.

I suspect part of it is habit.  They're so used to spouting off to fill time, that when they have actually have something to say, they've forgotten how to say it objectively, without adding their own commentary to it.  The classic example, of course, is how often republicans or conservatives are labeled as such, and how rarely democrats and liberals get the same treatment.  As if conservatism was a wholly aberrant behavior, and liberalism is the way of all thinking people.  

(As a side note, the inability of much of the modern politico-media class to see tolerate dissent and discussion without seeing it as an attack, a symptom of eeeeevil, or some kind of neanderthalic imbecility is disturbing, whether it comes from Jerry Falwell or Tom Brokaw.)

There is, of course, a reason for the abundance of news programs.  They're cheap, and they attract advertisers.  A good example is Detroit Channel 2 (WJBK).  In my youth, channel 2 was CBS, and got all kinds of network programming, from game shows to sitcoms to soap operas.  The station didn't have to provide a whole lot of stuff, and there was only five, maybe six hours of news a day.  Then they switched to Fox, which didn't have any daytime programs.  Sure WJBK picked up some syndicated stuff, but they suddenly began to run a whole lot of news.  Likewise, Channel 62 (WWJ-TV) switched to CBS at the same time, and as a small channel elevated to greatness filled the gap with news.

Local news shows are really cheap.  A couple pretty people behind the desk, some equipment, a few reporters, and a design guy (for all the pretty graphics) are it.  Contrast that with a sitcom, where you need writers, actors (who can get some serious bucks if the show does well), costumers, more sets. . .  So it's easy to see why channels do news.

I don't really know what to do about it, of course, which is why this is a semi-regular rant and not a syndicated column.  Still, the rise of opinion masked as journalism needs to stop.  Maybe if we cut down on blow-driers?

"event","Yet another Thursday, and nothing at hand to scream about.  While it makes for a boring commentary, I suppose I'll go along with the ancient Chinese.  

Actually, I suppose there is something to talk about today.  The Israeli cabinet, as well as at least one Jerusalem newspaper, has pushed to have Yassir Arafat either expelled or exterminated.  That touched off a long debate about what to do with the man.

If you exile him, you remove him from your watchful eye and let him gain shelter with whoever would have him.  Not exactly a good option to take with a guy who reputedly has somewhere upwards of 6 million dollars in various Swiss accounts.  Plus, he gets to be a traveling celebrity.  Generally, then, you'd want to at least keep him where you have a modicum of control of his media access, as well as his comings and goings.

So we could kill him.  Well, no.  Martyrs are in vogue in that part of the world.  Should Uncle Yassir get his from a Mossad Uzi, the resulting wave of violence might well make the intifada look like a squabble in a pre-school sandbox.

So we can't kill him, and we can't kick him out.  We could try living with him.  Except that the man does, at least tacitly, encourage terrorism and attacks on the Israeli populace.  Were he an American citizen, his ass would have been in an execution chamber long ago.  Heck, Israel can't even seem to get a decent replacement for the guy when most of the world leans on Arafat.

Thankfully, the guy is doing us all a favor.  According to some reports (hotly disputed), Arafat had a heart attack recently, and he may or may not be suffering from stomach cancer.  Good.  Nice, internal causes of death.  Hell, if he hadn't come down with this stuff, somebody would have had to make him come down with it.  Hook him on Camels or something.

Of course, this probably isn't the end of the man, not by a long shot.  Castro's been around forever, and he's not going anywhere.  Pope John Paul II has been putting up with rumors of his imminent demise for years.  (Not that I'm comparing the Pope to Arafat, other than as a fellow sick old man.)

However, be that as it may, we can finally start to contemplate a world without Yassir.  What are we going to do when the old guy kicks.  As much as it will be nice not having that particular viper spewing venom in the region, somebody's going to have to replace him.  While I have to believe that there's a moderate element out there, one doesn't have to look much further than American politics to know that this isn't a good time to walk the center line.  Making it potentially worse, the likely candidates to replace him are the people he's gathered around himself; meaning people who largely think the same way he does.

Now it's true that these guys (and I would bet money that they're all men) won't be as entrenched and won't have the past record of Arafat to keep the people in line.  Heck, this next guy might even be willing to actually compromise, instead of treating negotiations as a way to buy time between rounds of bloody, bloody murder.

Sadly, I kinda doubt it.  End of rant."

"event","Yeah, it looks that way.  Ah well.  I don't know that it's a good thing, for a bunch of reasons, but Arnold is almost certainly going to be the next governor of California.

We'll skip over the ""what does he know about politics"" bits, because they're trite, overused, and quite possibly irrelevant.  After all, Arnold can't just muscle his proposals through the legislature, and I suspect the large Democratic majority in California's legislature isn't going to give him a free ride.

Personally, I think that lack of free ride is going to be the big problem.  Not that I defend Gray (Grey?) Davis, but I know for certain that California has some pretty big problems, and I know Arnold won't be able to just wave them away.  Of course, that seems to be what the California electorate wants of him, and when he doesn't deliver, there will be trouble.

I imagine Arnold could probably ask somebody to propose overturning the law allowing illegal immigrants the right to get a driver's license, and it could probably get solved pretty quickly.  I also suspect he can quickly repeal the raise in automobile registration taxes.  That's two of the most recent irksome problems in the state.  Now how about the rest?

California, more acutely than the rest of the nation, has a problem with their electrical system.  The trouble is, that there's no incentive to build more power lines, and upgrade the lines that currently exist.  The system is strained pretty heavily as it is, and I don't really forsee that load getting easier.  (Unless, of course, businesses keep leaving, in which case the load might well drop off.)  There are ways to address this problem, but they're a little technical.  Not exactly a sexy issue.  

Moreover, they will probably involve cutting Federal regulation on power distribution networks. (Deregulation only covered part of the power grid.  I can now sell power to whoever I want, but I have to distribute it in a very particular way.)  This is going to require a bruising fight, and I'm not sure Arnold's ""please everyone"" style is capable of entering this fight.

California has a crushing budget deficit.  The last number I heard quoted was about $8 billion, and that's before Arnold repeals the auto tax.  There are only two options available to the Governator.  He's either got to raise taxes or cut spending.  Neither of these are going to win any friends.  Nobody wants to pay more taxes (least of all the corporations, already leaving the state), so that option is probably out.  Not to mention that since that Arnold has come out so strongly against taxes he'd be politically suicidal to even consider raising them.

Cutting spending is equally hard.  Somebody's ox is going to be gored, and they're going to yelp.  Loudly.  If Arnold cuts benefits to illegal immigrants, he's a racist.  If he cuts benefits to the poor, they'll call him elitist, uncompassionate, or possibly racist there too.  I'm not even sure he can cut the state payroll, since everybody's union.  Plenty of rocks and hard places.

Let's look at Arnold's plan to ""Terminate"" special interests.  Like, how, chief?  Nobody in politics turns down free money, and none of these interests are inclined to stop trying to spend money to buy a voice in government.  (Come to think, it's not such a bad idea for these groups to be able to spend some money, because it's probably a good way for these groups to make a point.  Tune in sometime later for a potential way to eliminate special interests altogether, I don't have time now.)  Campaign finance laws are ineffective at best (remember the post-Watergate reforms?  How 'bout McCain Feingold, where the people that screamed the loudest about it are hurt the least?), unconstitutional at worst.  I suppose Arnold could pledge not to take any money, but he's just the chief executive of the state.  All those guys in the California Congress still need to finance their own re-elections somehow.

Bottom line, Arnold promised a magic-wand fix to California's problems.  The people wanted that, and they voted for it.  Now Arnold's got to deliver, and I just don't think he can.

I hope I'm wrong, though.  End of rant."

"event","Frankly, I've been hoping that if I ignored it, it'd go away.  Sadly, sticking my head in the sand has gotten me nothing but grit in my teeth.  So I'm going to chip in my two cents on the Joe Wilson deal.

A quick recap of the facts as I've heard them.  Joe Wilson, one-time ambassador to Iraq and general State Department flunky.  Apparently his last visit to Niger, at least prior to his investigation there, was in the ""early 80s"".  So clearly the guy didn't have his finger on the pulse of the nation.

Be that as it may, the guy gave a quick oral report to the CIA, it didn't get fact checked, and Mr. Wilson has since been claiming that ""those 16 words"" were a horrible lie and manipulation.

(As a quick parenthetical, they were neither.  The British government did claim, at the time, that the information was true.  Since then, the CIA has disputed it, but the Brits are sticking to their story.)

At any rate, the guy now claims that ""two senior administration officials"" revealed his wife's identity as a CIA ""operative"" to a conservative columnist by the name of Robert Novak (although I think he signs his columns ""Bob Novak"", I'll stick with Robert for now.  Since then, Mr. Wilson has been claiming that Karl Rove is responsible, and that he should be ""frog-marched"" to jail.

Okay, fine.  But there are a couple problems with Mr. Wilson.  First off, the guy worked closely with Al Gore when Al was in Congress, and has donated money to the Democratic party.  Still fine.  But why would you send a guy you knew worked for the opposing party to perform an investigation when you wanted one, presumably (in this scenario) politically-minded result to come out?

Further, apparently Mr. Wilson himself failed to sign a fairly standard agreement with the CIA.  The agreement is a sort of gag order that allows the CIA to censor everything you write (and say publicly) for a good long while, so that whatever secrets you were involved in don't get spilled.

Finally, Mr. Wilson's wife's status is in some doubt.  She's been called everything from an agent (undercover), an operative (under some cover, doing shifty spy things), and an analyst (sits in Maryland and looks at maps and documents).  If she was, in fact, either of the first two, and hence ""undercover"", wouldn't she be able (and quite willing, given the possibly physical danger she would presumably be exposed to) to point to a perfectly believable cover story?  I mean, that's what ""undercover"" is supposed to mean, that you have some kind of plausible story for doing what you're doing.  Hell, even James Bond used to pretend to work for ""Universal Exports"".

Either way, Wilson smells funny.  He wasn't intimately familiar with the local officials, he wasn't a trained intelligence operative/analyst/agent, he doesn't (to the best of my knowledge) have any sort of background in uranium mining, nuclear weapons, or nuclear power, and he was a clear political enemy of the present government.  So why'd he get picked by the CIA to go nosing around in Niger after some shady uranium sales in a delicate political climate?

I've got an answer.  Before I give it, I want to let it be known that I'm not the sort of conspiracy nut that sees the NSA under every rock and the FBI stealing my missing socks.

However, since the CIA is composed at least partially of professional spies and liars, and since they had at least some interest in finding out what's going on, how about this?  Suppose they sent in two agents.  One was very obvious.  His name was Joe W.  Wait, that might reveal his identity.  We'd better call him J. Wilson instead.

Anyway, Joe goes to Niger, mucks about, lets everyone know where he is, and generally screams: ""Look at me!  I work for the Americans!  I want to know if you're selling illegal uranium to America's enemies!""  Meanwhile, the other operative is sniffing around carefully.  While everybody's watching Joe Wilson's Keystone Cop routine, the real operative is getting some real information.

Heck, even this scandal could be part of the misdirection.  Leaking the man's wife's name, (and this is assuming she's an analyst, and thus in no real physical danger) is a good way to focus the press on the one issue, making it double-damned certain that everybody and their brother knows about the Wilson job.  So now everybody gets cocky about what the silly Americans don't know, while the real CIA spook is busily gathering all sorts of incriminating goodies.

Of course, this is so much semi-paranoid speculation.  Kinda cool, though.  End of rant."

"event","So the weekend has come and gone again.  And over the weekend, the big story was either Northwestern's shocking collapse against Minnesota, or Arnold pawing women.  Take your pick.

Now, I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't grope women.  Not at all.  On the other hand, it's really funny listening to the commentary on the story.  The Democrats are saying that groping women disqualifies Arnold from the office of Governor, and the Republicans are saying that it was a long time ago, and he's sorry now.

Anybody else find that screamingly funny?

This is just about Monica Lewinsky/Paula Jones/whomever in reverse.  Now, McClintock has stood up and said it's a bad thing.  I don't want to say that he was shamelessly scoring points on a major electoral rival, but it sure looks that way.

At any rate, I wish that the Big Two would take a position and stick with it.  The Democrats spent eight-plus years saying that ""sex didn't matter"", and the Republicans spent the same amount of time saying that a sleazebag like that didn't deserve to be in public office.  Come on, guys.  Somebody has to have some principles out there.

Now, let's look at this again.  Clearly, sex (and sexual misconduct) does matter.  Otherwise, people wouldn't be falling all over themselves to either point it out or say it's irrelevant.  Nobody would spend the money on the coverage if they didn't think it was damaging.  So why does this discussion keep happening?  

Clearly, the populace in general disapproves of this kind of behavior at this time.  Clearly both parties know this.  So why bother with all of this?  If the Republicans want to take a strong moral stance, do it, and disavow Der Arnold.  If the Democrats want to say that this sort of affair is irrelevant to the job performance of an elected official, be silent about it.  The hypocrisy here is painful.  Reminds me why politicians and lawyers are widely regarded as dishonest folks who'd say or do anything to make a buck and win a vote.

Look, I know the name of the game is to slander your opponents while making yourselves out to be saints, but it's a dumb game.  This isn't chess, where you can be black one game and white the next.  The sides aren't interchangeable here.  Even if it isn't politic to stick with your principles, why don't we try it?

After all, if nobody ever defends this sort of behavior, we'll see a lot less of it in public, eh?  End of rant."

"event","Sorry I forgot to rant and rave yesterday.  Suffice to say yesterday was not the best of days, and I promise not to do it again.  Or something.

Anyway, the astute members of the audience will remember a topic about a week ago that involved charter schools in Detroit.  Well, it turns out that the impetus for the debate was that a local businessman (I believe he made asphalt.) had provided two hundred million dollars to set up charter schools locally.  Today, the Detroit News informs me that this fine gentleman has decided that it clearly isn't worth the hassle, and has rescinded his offer.

Two hundred million dollars.  The man, quite frankly, could have done anything up to line the kids up against the wall and shoot them, and not done any worse than Detroit Public Schools are already doing.  And, because the city couldn't just shut up and say: ""We thank you, the parents of Detroit thank you, and the children of Detroit thank you,"" it's all gone.  Why was this done?  

Heaven knows the next time Detroit Schools cry about money, I'm going to laugh at them.  Loudly, and rudely.  And I don't care how much the mayor blames ""the suburbs"" this time, he can take a flying leap.  He had TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS to spend on schools, and he blew it.  Totally threw it away.  Just can't take the mayor, (or the governor, who had announced her plans to veto the bill permitting this project to move forwards) seriously anymore.

I just don't get it.

Another thing I don't get lately is the tremendous overuse of the word ""Nazi"".  Now does everybody know who the Nazis were?  The National Socialist German Worker's Party.  Believed in a national, socialist, state by and for ""Die deutsche Volk.""  Which means for the German people.  Just the German people.  Everybody else could get bent.

These National Socialists were seriously nasty SOBs who killed upwards of nine million people, solely on the basis of their race.  They lead a war of aggression that killed many more millions.  They aggressively nationalized art and architecture, forcibly establishing a ""German culture"" that conformed solely to the leader's artistic vision.  They dictated to German industries exactly what they would and would not produce.  They engaged in censorship, propaganda, and state-sanctioned seizure of private property.

Now where do we get off calling anybody else Nazis?

At best, things like the ""Soup Nazi"" are mildly funny, and subtly degrade the unsullied evil the Nazi party represented.  Even I make jokes like this.  I shouldn't, but I do.

But comparing any even vaguely authoritarian person or idea you disagree with to a Nazi is not only extremely offensive to the person you slander, but diminishes the awful reality of what the Nazis were.  

The Nazis were not the political party with which you disagreed.  When they gained power, they abolished all other parties.  

The Nazis were not the religious organization you oppose.  The Nazis established a state church to whitewash some of their propaganda.

The Nazis weren't the people that politely and professionally dissuade you from doing whatever the hell you please.  The Nazis would arrest you, interrogate you, and possibly imprison you in a concentration camp; a camp which makes the Guantanamo Bay detention facility look like the Waldorf Astoria.

There is virtually no person, place, or thing on this earth today that even comes <i>near</i> the virulence of Nazi evil.  No-thing.  No-where.  So let's stop using the word ""Nazi"" except where it's really appropriate, alright?  Let's stop using ""reductio ab Hitler"" arguements to demonize and denigrate things we disagree with.  Let's not use ""Nazi"" as shorthand for ""bad"".  Please?

"event","My car has a computer in it that calculates my gas mileage.  Frankly, I think this is a pretty cool thing.  It even tells me, roughly, how much distance I can drive before me tank is empty, computing this based on my average MPG and the rough amount of fluid in my tank.

So when I left this morning, I checked the computer.  It told me that I had 96 miles left on my tank.  More than enough.  You can imagine my shock when the fuel light came on, 20 miles later as I pulled into the parking space.  I checked the computer, and it told me I had only 38 miles to go.

Traffic was actually quite pleasant on my way downtown this morning.  No jams, no tie-ups.  I made good time, I avoided my brakes, and generally I drove in as efficient a manner as I know how to do.  So how did my mileage get that bad, that fast?  Confusing me even more, I ran into traffic on my way home, and 20 miles later had 56 miles left in my tank, about what I would expect had I only checked it this morning.  Even more fun, the fuel light didn't come on as I pulled out of my parking spot this evening.

I suppose it could have been a glitch in the system.  Heaven knows I've seen those before.  Even had my car die on me once when the computer fried.  (In an 88 K Car, no less.  I didn't know those things had them.)  Still, it seems there's something else wrong here.

I've known for years that the fuel gauge in my car is based on a float in the gas tank.  As the fuel level falls, the float drops, pulling down the lever it's attached to, triggering either an electrical or a mechanical signal, and moving the gauge on my dashboard.  That's why the fuel gauge goes up and down as you drive over hills.

Now, it's a fine system, if a little susceptible to the terrain.  But I'm sure at this point we can do far better.  So here's my little idea.  Why not put a mass sensor on the fuel tank?  Put a pan beneath it, and just weigh the damned thing?  Gasoline has a relatively constant weight, and even if some of it is gas phase, the tank still has the mass inside, so the weight doesn't change.  Should be too hard, should it?  It'd even eliminate the stupid error readings on my gas gauge, and leave me a little less panicked downtown.

Ah well.  I'm not with SAE, so I guess I get no say in the matter.  End of rant."

"event","I hate telemarketers.  Really.  The above subject line is probably one of the more polite things I've said to them.  I really hate the ones where I pick up and get a tape recorded message, since I can't even abuse them.  Come to think, the only telephone solicitors I encourage are the Red Cross, and that's helped by the fact that once I give them what they want, they leave me alone for 8 weeks (and give me a cookie and some OJ).  

My father is even more cruel to them.  He's been leading on this window salesman for months.  He gets some perverse pleasure out of jerking the guy around, and since as a telemarketer the guy has ceded his rights as a human being, I can't really complain.

As you can imagine, therefore, I derived a great deal of pleasure from the Do Not Call registry.  Imagine, a world where nobody would call me at 5:30 to hawk insurance, or a credit card, or a Florida vacation (with apologies to Floridians, your climate sucks).  The only downside was that I'd lose an entire class of people who I could demean and abuse with impunity.

So when the DNC registry was voided by a Federal Judge, Edward Nottingham, I was rather upset.  These jerks would be able to keep pestering me, and I couldn't do anything about it.  Something so unbelievably publicly popular as the DNC registration had been yanked by a federal judge.  And then I stopped to think.

The judge said basically two things.  First, that the DNC list was an unjustified abbreviation of free speech - but only because the rule had a loophole for politicians and charities.  That's rather encouraging, actually.  I'm generally against restrictions on political speech, like, say, the McCain-Feingold bill.  So I can get behind this.

Second, the judge said that the FTC had no authority to regulate that sort of thing.  When I thought about it, I actually cheered.  A federal judge striking down a government program because the agency <i>had no authority to administer it</i>.  (apologies if I screwed up the html just then)  Restricting the growth and ""mission creep"" of the Federal government is music to my Federalist heart.  Hopefully this sort of thing will continue, and the EPA, and IRS, and all the rest of those bothersome bureaucracies will get their wings clipped.

If only I didn't want those damned telemarketers gone so badly.  Still, no matter how much I want those pests banned, I had probably better stick with my principles on this.

"event","After having great raging topic ideas for two or three days last week, I seem to have forgotten them all by now.  In the future, I suppose I'll have to write them down, although that can be a little hard since I do most of my thinking on the Lodge Freeway.  Sadly, I've already ranted once recently about people doing dumb stuff on the road, so I'll leave that topic for now.

I'm actually still a little unsure of what constitutes proper blogging.  I mean, I understand that it's supposed to be a ""web log"" but I'm unsure what constitutes a proper log, and what separates it from the standard flood of self-indulgent whining that pretty much characterizes LiveJournals the world over.

I don't suppose it really matters.  It's not as if there's some sort of LJ police watching over my shoulder to smite me like a naughty Israelite for violating Divine Writ.  Just a personal sense of shame, I guess.

So, after checking the news, it appears that there are two big national stories lately.  The first, and probably most interesting, is the California recall.  I can't keep up with the thing, and that's not just because I can't casually spell Schwarzenegger.  I hear polls saying the recall is losing popularity, I hear polls saying Davis is a guarantied loss.  Polls tell me Cruz will win, or Arnold, or McClintock, or Arnold if McClintock drops out, or vice versa, or whatever. . .

Point is, everybody's taking polls, and clearly they're all, in R. Lee Ermey's immortal words ""equally worthless.""  I've always more or less been of the opinion that the only poll that matters is one in November (or October as the case may be).  It's actually the reason I hate focus group politics.  Too much whining about how every little decision affects your ratings, and no thoughts about any kind of long term plan.

Coming from Detroit, I have another reason for hating focus groups.  Design (and policy) by focus group means that every loud, obnoxious segment gets their own part of the pie, and the whole thing looks like crap.  Take a look at the Pontiac Aztek some time for a good example.

Anyway, I mentioned two stories, so I may as well cover two stories.  The second is this business with Ambassador Wilson and his wife who apparently works for the CIA.  I recall this came up originally a couple months ago (I don't recall the exact date), and I thought it was a typical government screwup that would go away in a couple of weeks.  At the time, I was correct.

Now, of course, everybody is either blaming somebody, or citing excuses.  I've heard from some sources that whoever first leaked the story (no two sources seem to agree on this, to the point of at least two of them claiming to have heard it from each other) thought Mrs. Wilson was an analyst not an agent.  I almost don't care.  Clearly, the woman was doing something sensitive, and clearly the whole world found out about it.  

This is not, generally speaking, a Good Thing.  On the other hand, it's freaking Niger.  Any grown-up nation realizes that even their close allies spy on them.  I'd be willing to bet that somebody working with Tony Blair is actually working for us, and I suspect that Ari Sharon is mailing paychecks to some guy in DC.  It's just the way things work.  Nigeria is hardly a close ally of the US (Check out the new rigid enforcement of Islamic law there these days.  Might wind up the New Taliban.), and so they know now we spied on them.  What are they going to do, starve a little more in protest?

Yes, there was a screwup.  Yes somebody leaked.  Yes when we can pin down who, we ought to fine/imprison/punish the hell out of the person responsible.  Do we need to keep harping on it?  No.

"event","So I've had the History Channel on lately, and I've seen some stunning movie commercials.  No, I don't mean ""Underworld"", although that was a good enough film.  I'm talking about ""Luther"".  

Now, Martin Luther is a man with ups and downs.  For the ups, he challenged the pseudo-theocratic orthodoxy of the medieval Catholic church.  He analyzed their teachings, compared them with the Biblical source material, and found them wanting.  He started a movement that expanded religious freedom, caused the Catholic Church to reform their own mistakes, and enabled people, through use of Gutenberg's printing press, to read the Bible for themselves and make their own informed decisions.

On the downside, his actions caused a chain of events that lead to centuries of war, persecution and murder.  Likewise, then man was about as anti-Semitic as you can find in a church setting (The Jews killed Jesus, they're unbelievers, yadda, yadda, yadda.).  As a Lutheran myself I'm somewhat biased, but I suspect that on balance (given that the modern Lutheran church is as anti-Semitic as Temple Beth-El down the road) Luther was a net gain for the Western world.

As such, I don't really mind a movie about the man, although I'm going to withhold judgment on its historical accuracy (and its portrayal of Lutheran theology) until after I've seen it.  However, I've got to ask what's up with all the Bible movies coming out these days.

Mel Gibson's film ""Passion"" is coming out soon, amid a storm of controversy.  I've heard Rabbis say it's not anti-Semitic, and Rabbis say it is.  Frankly, I suspect that the only Jews portrayed negatively in the film are the religious leaders who saw JC as a threat to the orthodoxy and/or their personal power  (Likewise, we're probably going to leave the film with a certain negative opinion of the Roman Empire.).  Given that the protagonist of the film is, himself, a Jew, I don't think there's going to be much overall anti-Semitism.  (Or could we say that ""The Magnificent Seven"" was anti-Latino since the villains of the piece were Mexicans?)

That's not all, either.  ""The Gospel of John"" is in production, and from what I hear, it contains virtually the whole book in there somewhere (the exact quote I heard was from Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who said: ""(T)he soundtrack includes virtually every word of the Gospel. . .""  (He was commenting that nobody was objecting to anti-Semitism in that film, but since it's beside the point, I trimmed it.)

I don't mind all the Christian-themed movies out, per se, but I'm both a little worried and a little confused.  Confused, of course, because Hollywood isn't known for its love of religion generally, much less Christianity in particular.   I'm also tempted to point out that pretty inevitably, the book (the Book?) is better than the movie.  So I'm not entirely sure what's prompted this sudden surge in faith-based films.

That leads to the worry.  I'm not sure what's going to happen, but I'm a little worried that these films are going to give some unflattering and possibly wildly incorrect views of my religion.  Given the irreverence with which pop culture treats everything else it gets its hands on, I'm not convinced that the sacred will be any less, well, sacred in the hands of Hollywood.  I mean, by all accounts this is some kind of personal expression of piety by Mel, but since I hear that the other two are produced by Jews, I doubt personal piety is the motive for ""Luther"" and ""John"".

I want to be really careful here.  I'm not saying that because anybody's Jewish, or works in Hollywood, they're out to smear Christians.  What I am saying is that I'm unsure of why these movies are being made, and in a culture that seems bent on removing JC from public discourse (when was the last time you heard Him mentioned by anybody on TV?) I can't help but remember ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and think this isn't some way to sneak in a cheap shot.  

Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I can't really fathom a reason for all of this sudden celluloid celebration of Christianity.  Maybe somebody listened to Joe Lieberman's endless cries about the immorality in Hollywood, and decided to to something about it, but I kinda doubt it.

"event","Well, I'm filling out one of the neglected topics from yesterday.  

For those not from Michigan, we have a long-running fight in the state.  On one side are the teachers unions, and on the other the Republican party.  It started about 12 years ago, when the then-candidate for governor John Engler noticed that the union gave primarily to the Democratic party.  So John started a campaign designed to break the political power of that union.  In retribution, the union has stepped up its efforts on behalf of the Democrats.  That's just sort of a prelude to today's bit of fun.

See, one of the big ways Engler tried to break the union was the aggressive promotion of charter schools (which happen to be, in my opinion, a shockingly good idea.  We'll get to that later, probably.).  Well, today, there was supposed to be a discussion in Lansing (the state capital) on the issue, so nearly all the teachers in Detroit Public Schools took the day off to attend.  Since there were no teachers, classes for the day were canceled.  According to the radio, 153,000 kids had no class today.  And they wonder why the kids can't read.

Come on, Detroit has among the worst schools in the country.  Now, there are a whole lot of social pathologies that don't help here; single mothers, poverty, crime, apathy, and a resistance to ""acting white"" (which I don't understand at all, but there you go).  However, I've got to think that the if the teachers in Detroit were truly concerned with helping the kids, they would have spent the day educating them - perhaps even discussing this policy and its possible effects with them - instead of traipsing to Lansing to protest school choice.  (By the way, I hear that the discussion got canceled on account of the planned protest.)

I happen to like unions, in small doses.  They're certainly an antidote to abuse by management, and they serve a valued and definite purpose.  However, I feel that they've passed the point of usefulness and become a general problem.  Part of it is the innate assumption that the unions are the ""good guys"" and the corporations are the ""bad guys"".  While that was probably true back in the day (my knowledge of this period is lacking, so I'll be as generous as I can), it's not so true now.  

Think of Jimmy Hoffa (a good local boy.  I pass by the last place he was seen alive on my way to church every week.) and the mafia corruption of the Teamsters.  Think of the perks of the teacher's union in Florida (I think Miami-Dade) that just got pasted for junkets to Africa among other things.  The leadership of the unions can be just as corrupt as the leadership of the corporations, and now that the gross injustices have been ironed out (forty hour work weeks, benefits, and all), either side of the management/union debate is likely to make ridiculous demands of the other.

Sadly, combined with the public perception of ""goodness"", the unions also have the whip hand contractually.  For example, should the UAW have decided to strike, the automakers would be subsidizing the strike pay of their striking workers.  Why is this?  The loss in production is sufficient inducement to end the strike.  The company shouldn't be forced to pay you when you're refusing to work.

In the public sector, of course, it's even worse.  The government is paying with my money, and they're notoriously slow and inefficient (I requested a transcript release two weeks ago from Wayne State, and it still hasn't been processed), so they have no incentive not to end the strike by giving the workers whatever they ask for.  It's not as if the state can go out of business, after all.  We can't shop elsewhere with our tax dollars.

Hence, I'm going to make the assertion (tying the whole mess together) that government employees shouldn't be allowed to unionize.  If you don't like working for the state, work for somebody else who pays better.  Might help trim government bureaucracy too, if nobody really wants to work there.

Anyway, I promised to get to school choice.  It's probably not a surprise to any of you by now that I'm pro-market capitalist.  Hence, I have the nearly axiomatic Darwinist belief that competition makes things better.  So why shouldn't schools have to compete?

I think we can all agree that a monopoly gets sloppy.  They don't have any reason to do better, because nobody can go anywhere else.  Hence the best way to squeeze more performance out of the schools is to compete.  I've heard statistics that the few charter schools in Detroit have performed much better than the general public schools, and that there are long lists to get your kids into them.  So why not expand the process, and get more kids to do better?

I know it's supposed to siphon money from public schools, but I've gotta say, who cares?  Schools get money (and spend it) per-pupil.  Cutting the number of pupils (by sending them elsewhere) and giving that money to the parents to spend on another school doesn't harm the kids still in the old system.  In fact, if anybody leaves the old system for the new, it's a pretty clear indication that the old system sucks eggs.

I'm of the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school, but it's pretty clear the current system is broke.  Badly.  According to a survey (it was in the paper over the weekend, but I forget the source) America spends more money per pupil than anybody else, and yet we average about 20th in student achievement.  The Czech Republic outperforms us, for Pete's sake.  Charter schools seem to work on the small scale we've tried them, and private schools habitually do well.  Let's let them compete directly with the public schools by allowing even poor parents to afford them.  Let's provide scholarships in the amount of the per-pupil expenditure of the local school districts, and let the parents decide whether to put their kids in public schools with the money or put them in some kind of private school.

If it doesn't work, we go back to the old way.  Besides, it's not like we could do a much worse job than we're already doing for those kids.

Ah what do I know.  End of rant."

"event","Man.  I had one topic in mind for today originally.  Then, I got two more for free.  I'm really torn, but I suppose I'll start with the flukiest one first.

On my way to class this morning, I passed three, count them three, Hummer H2s within the space of a mile.  I suppose I should take this as a good sign.  Those things are expensive (About $50,000 give or take), and to suddenly see so many is probably an indication the economy is moving upwards.  On a more local level, it means more people are buying cars from GM (yeah, GM distributes Hummers now), and hence the local economy is getting a particular boost.

On the other hand, I'm generally deeply ambivalent about SUVs in general.  I generally support people's right to buy and drive whatever car they can afford (and afford to fuel).  Further, an estimate from the GM Jamestown manufacturing plant about 5 years ago indicates that an SUV is about $10,000 of pure profit for the automakers.  I'm a huge fan, again given that I live in the automotive capital of the known universe.

But I gotta say, SUVs piss me off something fierce, particularly the Hummer.  For starters, you can't see around them.  I drive a sedan, so I can't see through their rear window to the street in front of them, and they're too wide to look around unless I wander into somebody else's lane.  

Second, they're nearly invariably driven by two classes of people: male jerks, and female idiots.  The jerks cut me off and slam on their brakes (don't you know?  They drive an SUV, and that means they own the road.  Silly plebeian.), they take up two lanes, they park across three spaces, they go straight in turn-only lanes. . .   Okay, deep breath.  The idiots, meanwhile, are sure that the green light will change any minute now, so they have to go really slow or ride their brakes so they don't run it yellow.  Except that when the light does turn yellow, they gun it and leave me stopped at a light that I (and two or three people behind me) could have made if little miss moron could possibly go the speed limit.

Minivans are offenders here, too.  Not only are they hard to see through (one of the few new government regulations I think I'm going to endorse here is the banning of tinted rear windows on minivans.  Some of us like to see the whole road, for reasons I'll get to in a minute.), but usually it's mom and a couple of kids.  The canonical example was the woman I saw with at least two kids waving helium-filled balloons in the back, a burger in one hand, a coke in the other, and a cell phone between her cheek and shoulder.
 
Man, why can't other people drive?  Seriously, when I grab hold of that plastic ring I have three goals: to get where I'm going, be a minimal hassle to my fellow drivers, and not waste gas, in about that order.  Sadly, those goals don't seem to be shared by about 60% of the yahoos out there, primarily in those SUVs and minivans.  (although old guys in Cadillacs or Lincolns are hardly innocent)

When the light is green, you go.  You might want to make sure nobody is running their light red, but you should probably be off your brakes before I can slow-count one.  If two guys in the other lane have cleared the intersection before you start rolling, you're a jackass and should surrender your license and automobile post-haste.

Second, that speed limit thing.  I confess, I kinda consider the speed limit more of a minimum, but that's basic manners.  Some of us aren't fascinated by the shopping malls or suburban condos, and would really much rather travel, than follow your sorry ass dragging at fifteen under.  If you can't at least go the speed limit on a clear road on a clear day, stay at home.  We won't miss you, promise.

You jokers that take two lanes, or wander back and forth, PICK ONE.  I don't really care which, but you only get one.  It's even worse on a when you jerks do it on a two-lane road.  The rest of us get to use the road too, jerk.  You chumps that need to make a right turn, but hang out in the left lane until the last minute, tough luck.  I had to hit my brakes to squeeze right for my own turn, I'm not going to jam on them for you.

And by the way, nice use of the turn signal, jackass.

Finally, to you people who ride your freaking brakes, who slow down approaching green lights, and who tap your brakes for no good reason, I say ""MOVE IT.""  I burned fuel to get this speed, and it's a hell of a waste to use that energy heating my brakes.  Come on, gas is a buck fifty-six out there, have some consideration, Hummer boy.

One of these days, I'm getting a big old snow plow on my front end and just shoving you bastards out of my way.  End of rant."

"event","I was listening to news radio this morning over my orange juice, and I caught a couple of stories.  The story that struck me most of all was one about some medical study that found amounts of ""fire retardant chemicals"" in breast milk.  Sounds like a crisis, right?  Wrong.

First, and most damningly, they found this little problem in 20 women across the nation.  Twenty.  That's all.  I have more or less a standing policy on medical surveys.  Unless they're talking about a narrow disease state (Say, von Willebrand's disease or something), I drop any study that has less than a thousand samples.  Out of hand.  With twenty women, nearly any common factor could be present.  They only controlled for socio-economic status and geographical location, which is trivial.  No mention of whether any of these women lived near a building that burnt down, or a forest fire, or perhaps worked in the chemical industry somewhere, or any other of the million factors that could be involved.  Just that they had chemicals in their breast milk.

Second, and I'm going to show some ignorance here, so pay attention, to the best of my knowledge there are two primary fire retardant chemicals.  I know there are others (plastic foams, mostly), but in general use there are two compounds.  Any guesses?  That's right, CO2 and H2O.  Carbon Dioxide and water.  Now, I would treat water in breast milk about the same way I would treat paper in a book.  It's the medium in which all the goodies can be found.  CO2 doesn't bother me, particularly, given it's in the air, in the blood, in the tissues. . .  It's a pH buffer, folks.  

Those two probably aren't what they were worried about, but even then, how common are those chemicals?  Particularly around the women who are probably buying fire-resistant jammies, play-pens, and the like.  Even if these twenty are representative (and I doubt it highly), how big a problem is it?  And how unusual is it?

Hell, don't get me started on anti-microbial everything around children.  Other studies (and my own gut) tell me that it contributes to asthma and increased infection when the poor sheltered dears get out into the real world.  Hell, these are the same folks who freak out about kids eating dirt with lead contaminants (from leaded gasoline).  If they eat FREAKIN DIRT, cleaning your countertops isn't going to help much.

Looking back, that paragraph was incoherant.  I definitely spoke out of both sides of my mouth.  I oppose the excessive cleanliness (and the freakish obsession with sterility, and not playing in the dirt, and the mandatory violin, piano, dance, and French lessons, and. . .) and over-mothering.  Man do I hate over-mothering.  

Take school buses, for example.  They've got seat belts, these days.  Now, with one exception, I never rode on a bus with seat belts, and I survived just fine.  (That one exception, I was accompanying a handicapped kid on a field trip, and lemme tell you, the short buses are a hell of a lot of fun to ride without the seat belts, but you'll slam your head into the ceiling if you're not careful.)  You know what else?  You didn't used to have to stop on both sides of the street when a bus was picking up and dropping off kids.  You still shouldn't have to.  The kids aren't supposed to be crossing the main streets anyway.  Hell, my route had a two stops, directly across the street from each other, because the kids weren't allowed to cross the road.

How 'bout playground equipment, too?  (This is shaping up to be some kind of ""when I was your age"" argument, which I'm far too young to make.)  I played, with joy and abandon, on wooden play structures.  If I got a splinter, it was because I wasn't careful, or dumb.  Now they have to have metal structures.  PLASTIC-COATED metal structures.  Why is this?  Come on, they lack the feel, the vibe, of the whole thing.  Plus, they're a loathsome playground pink.  I can think of no better way to keep the boys off of the structures than to paint them pink.  Come on, I'm a big sissy, and I would have been embarrassed to play on a pink thing.

I don't know, it's probably futile.  End of rant."

"event","Right.  Well.  If you're here, you either know who I am, or have far too much free time on your hands.  Hence we'll dispense with the tiresome bits, and get to the point.

It seems that everywhere I turn lately, there's a blog.  Here a blog, there a blog, everywhere a blog, blog.  Old MacDonald. . .  Wait.  Try that again.

Anyway, since the things are so prevalent, I decided to get with the program (or climb on the bandwagon, depending on your attitude) and get one of my own.  So.  Herein will be daily (more or less) stream-of-consciousness babble about whatever's on my mind.  Religion, politics, personal stuff, ranting and raving.  Whatever.  So bear in mind, the stuff you see here is uncensored, unjustified, and unPC.  Just the way it ought to be.


And now the news, don't touch that dial.  Actually, since I didn't watch the news today, I don't have any real comments on that.  I mean, I do have some thoughts on general issues of the day, but I'll wait until something burbles to the top before shooting off my mouth.

Lessee. . .  Other than that, I spent about half my day in downtown Detroit.  The first chunk was in class.  The usual stuff, although I've never had a prof so blase about bullet wounds and knife fights.  After class, I met my folks and some people from church to go to dinner in my favorite, probably mobbed-up Italian place, down in Eastern Market.

We had some time to kill before we were supposed to meet them, so we wandered around the area.  Now, for those who don't know, Detroit has been gradually abandoned by anybody with enough money since probably the race riots in 64.  (My folks attribute it to forced school busing breaking up neighborhoods, and I wasn't there, so I won't argue the notion.)  

So the area we went through was originally a high-rent district.  Nice brick houses, some vaguely colonial, some vaguely Victorian.  One had the original owner/builder's name carved in the stone lintel above the door.  Most were two or three stories, generally very nice.  With one or two exceptions, they were all abandoned.  Graffiti, boarded-up windows, bricks broken, one house had been dug out to the foundations, and huge chunks of the brickwork had been removed.  I could see the interior of the basement from the back seat of my parents' van.

From there, we took Woodward from the DMC (a reasonably nice area, more or less) down past Grand Circus Park, Campus Martius, and within a block of the river.  My parents gave a running commentary.  We passed the former site of the largest retail establishment in the country (slightly more floor space than Macy's in New York, and I think much larger than Harrod's in London, but don't quote me on that), upscale men's and women's clothiers, clubs, theaters, the whole bit.  Almost all of these places were abandoned.  Vigorously so.  Bricks torn away, marquees caved in, the road torn up.

Now, I'm going to add that we passed the new stadium for the Tigers, which was nice, the gorgeous Fox Theater (still in operation), the Detroit Opera Hall, a club or two, and a couple of restaurants, and the brand new headquarters of Compuware (multi-million dollar computing firm).  Now, I'm from Detroit.  I'm even proud of the fact.  But dear Lord, the place is a mess.  Such beautiful buildings, such potential.  All left to rot.  All abandoned.  Why?  Why did anybody not see the slide?  Why didn't anybody try to stop it?

It's really too damned late now.  Stadiums, a few companies, a couple of casinos?  What are they going to do?  Detroit has been the headquarters of two of the largest companies in the world for years.  I drive by the monolithic old headquarters of GM (very nice building, my poor architectural training leaves me bereft of a style, but I'm inclined to say Romanesque) every day, and I can see the gleaming Renaissance Center (GM's new HQ) from the freeway.

The city's dead, and I want to know why.  It certainly can't be the Rust Belt thing.  The Big Three still measure income in the billions of dollars annually, to say nothing of all the subsidiary firms (thousands of parts per car, probably 20-30 different models with varying bodywork, requiring molds and presses, all the different sub-assembly processes, windows, rubber, or, like my dad once said, how much do you think the guy who sells steel to GM gets on comission?).  

We've got one major university and two reasonable ones in the immediate vicinity if not in the city proper, as well as a superlative hospital system.  

We certainly have the people to do it, last numbers I heard (and that some years ago) was that there were about 6 million people in the metro area.  

It can't be the money, either.  A couple mayors ago, we blew millions on a stupid mass-transit system with six stops that goes one way only.  What the hell is wrong out here?

I know the mayor sucks (although I did rather enjoy the last one.  Rock on, Dennis.) and the city is corrupt as all hell, but hey, it didn't kill Chicago.  Come on.  Something.  This shouldn't be happening here.  Not in this country.  

Bah.  End of rant."

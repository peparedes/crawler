"event","Does anyone still use LiveJournal? I haven&#39;t posted here in over 2.5 years. I think Facebook killed the LiveJournal. Which is sad, because I used this fucker for YEARS chronicling my life and thoughts. I&#39;ve got posts on here I&#39;m embarrassed to have written I used it for so long. 7 years. That&#39;s how long I used LiveJournal. I started using it over 10 years ago. Man a lot has changed in that time.

I feel like I should save all of my previous posts somewhere for the future in case the site goes down. I can&#39;t imagine enough people still use it for them to make much money anymore these days.

This leads me to the problem with Facebook. Micro-blogging allows for so many posts throughout the day that it becomes close to impossible to really go back and relive your previous posts in a coherent way. The new Timeline feature make it POSSIBLE (whereas it was previously incredibly difficult to see past posts), but it&#39;s still not really that easy. (*Ok, so I just went and played with Timeline... it&#39;s not bad.)"

"event","I'm at a complete loss right now. My dog, who is a sweet, loving puppy to us but no one else, I think has some sort of disorder or brain damage... or just is unbalanced in some way. As many of you know, he is NO good with strangers, but he seems to be getting worse and worse as time goes on. Last night we gave him a tasty dog treat shaped like a bone and he growled and protected it like a vicious wild animal--this is something he does with stuff he REALLY likes, but this time felt different because he would growl and get defensive of it when we just moved on the couch (he was on the ground). It was the most extreme he's ever gotten. And then, when we went to bed, with absolutely nothing to protect, I leaned in to kiss his forehead and he snarled and growled at me. If I pushed and got in close anyway, he gave in and licked me... I wasn't happy but I went to bed.

Then! This morning! We did our normal routine of him going pee and getting breakfast, then we went back upstairs to sleep more. I reached down to him to pet him and he did the protective growling again with NOTHING to protect and even nipped at me!! He didn't bite me though, because so far that's not what he does, but I'm no longer sure he won't. And now that it's for apparently no reason, I can't assume he's ""just a sweet dog"" anymore. I think there is seriously something wrong with him that is beyond any training."

Here are three of them, out of five. One of the ones I'm not posting, while what the woman was looking for, kind of lacked any sort of art to it. These other three though, I think turned out pretty well. I'm posting them in the order I shot them, so you can get an idea for how I improved as I went along. The fifth shoot isn't done yet. There will be a re-shoot and more going through them first.

Athena saw an ad for ""office / service space"" available for $450 a month in the building Mr. Mike's is in, on the second floor (On Main, near S. Winooski). Now, it's pretty small, only 425 sq feet, which is like a large living room, but the ad said it has a large window for plenty of natural lighting, which is great for photography! If it has brick walls and hard wood floors (which is common in Burlington, especially that area) then I could probably really easily turn it into a personal studio. I would need props and equipment of course, but that would come with time.

I did a boudoir shoot the other day with a very attractive girl (photos may/may not come later after she's looked over and approved web-content) and I feel it was pretty successful! I'm considering expanding and making boudoir something to make a career out of. Also, the portraits I've been shooting recently have been turning out really good. 

My goal, if I get the studio space, is to shoot boudoir for about $200-$400 depending on the package (36 shot book, 1.5 shooting time; 72 shot book, 3 hours shooting time; etc) and portraits for around $50-$100 for personal head shots, baby portraits, family portraits, and engagement portraits. Engagement portraits would probably be more though because it would take much more of my time and I'd probably want to present a book to them as well.

Anyway, the point is, while it would be hard to pay for the studio rental space I think that if I make an extra $25 a night in tips from Papa John's, I could pay for it even if I get NO paying business. Then, if I DO get paying business, any cent I make from it would go toward equipment and props. I need lighting equipment, backdrops, upgraded lens, possibly an upgraded camera, boudoir props like old phones, chairs, couches, etc. I would want to make the studio have a different feel or look depending on the wall you look at.

I currently need to make $40/night to pay for bills and groceries and make that without a hassle. Also, Athena and I have been putting away $10/night to a savings account. While some nights I don't make this, the week has always averaged out to make it so there was no issue. I feel an extra $15/night would be difficult, but not impossible. Basically it would mean NO spending cash, at all. This puts extra pressure on Athena to pay for the fun stuff we would like to do, otherwise we become hermits and sit at home watching movies or downloaded TV shows.

In more photography news, we stopped at a local gallery/art store, <a href=""http://www.froghollow.org/"">Frog Hollow</a>, and checked out the photography work they have there... and I feel my current Vermont landscape shots are on par with or better than most of the photographers in there. There were two though, <a href=""http://www.johndavidgeery.com/"">John David Geery</a> and <a href=""http://www.froghollow.org/store/manufacturerview/43"">Alistair McCallum</a> (<a href=""http://www.alistairmccallum.com/"">official site</a>) that stood out as much better than I am.

I wouldn't say that any of the other photographers had the potential to create more interesting or dynamic photos than me, but these two had. I aspire to create what they have."

"event","I feel like my photography, while getting better, is also getting stale. I feel like I'm just getting better at taking the same thing over and over again--nature, beautiful, bokeh--and that I'm not taking real ""art."" 

I keep looking at some streams on Flickr like <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/vorfas/"">'Vorfas</a>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/piero_marsili_libelli/"">Piero Marsili Libelli</a>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/xylonets/sets/72157613393726688/"">Xylonets</a>, and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/milkgarlictoast/"">Mike Garlington</a> and realizing how much <i>art</i> is injected into their photos that seems to be missing from mine.

I want to be called an artist, not just a photographer. 

I'm branching out and setting up appointments to shoot head-shots and portraits, which is an area I need major practice at, but I think I also need to work on my artistry. I'm not sure how to do this though, other than just going out and shooting.

The problem I'm facing is that most of my shots (if not all) are found. I come upon an image I want to capture, and I shoot it until I'm happy with it. A lot of the above referenced Flickr streams are created photo shoots. They are crafted much like an artist with a paintbrush decides what he/she is going to paint. I need to do this, but I also need inspiration to do so. 

Even though it will basically be ""found art"", I'm going to remedy this dilemma by going out and shooting today before I have to go into work. I'm going to go to the traintracks, and other industrial areas instead of my normal haunts of nature and ""pretty"". I'm going to attempt to find more gritty and dirty scenes to capture. 

Wish me luck! If there are any worth while results, you will of course see them here."

"event","Is LiveJournal dead?

While the website is celebrating it's 10th year, I'm noticing that more and more of my friends are leaving it for sites like MySpace and Facebook and not updating their LiveJournal accounts nearly as often. It's like this has become the place for the old fogies. This is the social networking site for those less ""hip"". 

Why though? What's wrong with good old text based updates? What's wrong with talking and engaging in a dialog with someone via comments? What's wrong with getting wordy and expressing yourself in a long entry? Are people getting even *lazier* than in recent days with 160 character updates?

It annoys me so much to have to go to multiple sites to check up on my friends updates to the point that I almost don't care to connect with anyone via social networking sites anymore. I'd much rather have one on one conversations with these people via text, IM or *gasp* over the phone.

Communication via voice will make a come back. Or, maybe, ya know, even in person!"

"event","Thank you to those who took the time to let me know what they thought of my site.

Adam had a few suggestions for me that I've been working on and I think I've got it pretty good. There is still one more suggestion I want to implement though, I just have to figure out how.

Previously, the site imported my Flickr favorites to the ""favorites"" link and it made people assume they were photographs <i>I</i> took. Well, this was misleading and not what I wanted on my site so I spent ALL of yesterday (literally) figuring out how to put MY favorites in that spot, and I finally succeeded. 

I also changed the link ""recent"" to ""portfolio"" and then later to ""all"". I think all works well because when you see a link that says all, you assume it's all of whatever is on the site, right? In this case, all of my photos. It's only partly true though, as when you click you only see 40 of my images by most recently taken. (I may change it to most recently uploaded so when people view the site they don't have to shift through to see what they already saw if I upload things out of taken order.) They can then click on ""prev"" to go back to the next page of 40.

This brings up another question: How many images should I display at a time of my ""all"" tab? It's in rows of 8, so 40 is 5 columns. Should it be 3, 4, 5, 6, or ""all""? (24, 32, 40, 48, 80 or 96...for now)

Another thing I did was add an icon to the url/favorites. :-) It's pretty crude and I challenge anyone to make me a better one. Adam? You're awesome at that stuff, want to create me an icon when you get a computer? And then scale it down to 16x16 for icon stuff? (Well, if you send it to me, I can make the icon, but I need something that looks good at 16x16.)

And that's all for today. There's probably more I'm not thinking of.

"event","Athena and I have determined that there are 5 basic styles of Mexican food in the Los Angeles area. You can argue that there are more flavors, or that there are more styles and types, or you could argue that they break down further than I have done; but, let me explain my vision of each first and hopefully you will be able to see what I mean.

<ol><li><b>The Burrito Joint</b>

This should be obvious to most Angelinos, and hell, most of the rest of the country. This is the type of place you order to go or to stay and you get a burrito. Sometimes they offer salads or quesadillas, but their main fare is the burrito. 

They taste fresh and can range from heavy to healthy, but usually fall somewhere in between.

<li><b>Baja Style</b>

This includes places like Baja Fresh (obviously), Rubio's and other healthy, light fare. Yes, they have burritos. Yes, they have salads. Yes, they have chips and salsa. The difference is that everything they serve is light. Not necessarily healthy, though they usually are healthi<i>er</i>.

If you have eaten at one of these joints you know what I mean.

<li><b>Fast Food Mexican</b>

Del Taco, Taco Bell, Taco Bueno. Well, I don't know about that last one, but I would assume based on the fact that it is a chain and fast food. (Could be wrong. Might fit into the next category.)

These are the places that you can drive through, that are fast and convenient. They are the bastardized, American versions of what was once considered Mexican food. They are lacking in complexity and heaviness, they are lacking in healthy flavor, they are lacking in any quality trait that is associated with Mexican, but they come with all the bad ones. 

I have a place in my heart for these places, but most wouldn't even call them Mexican food.

<li><b>Greasy, Heavy, REAL Mexican Joint</b>

These come with no description necessary, but I shall give one anyway. These are the fast places run by actual Mexicans with real Mexican spices and ingredients. The food may not be 100% fresh, but it doesn't come in a can full of preservatives either. No one would ever claim this food to be heart healthy or South Beach friendly. You won't find it on any diet website. 

They are usually loved by the locals, and unknown to anyone else. They are tasty and do funny things to your stomach afterward. Classified as heavy, greasy, unhealthy. Oh, and damn tasty.

<li><b>Restaurant Style</b>

This is the high cost blend of Baja and Real. It usually takes longer to prepare, they have fancy names for the dishes, and it is often quite good. It generally takes on a more healthy taste of real.</ol>Athena and I, having thought about this and Vermont's eateries, have determined that Vermont has the Burrito Joints, they have the Fast Food places, and they have the Restaurant Style places--but what they don't have are the Real places and the Baja places.

We miss both."

"event","It's now been over a year since I've lived in Vermont, and I'm just now starting to feel the pain of not being able to just stop by my mom's house.

It's not homesickness I'm feeling, because I really do feel like Vermont is home now. And it's not missing my mom or family or friends that's doing it, because I talk to them on a fairly regular basis (my mom mostly via email and text messaging). It's the inability to just stop by to say hi, the inability to give my mom a hug, the inability to bring my dog over to meet her dog, the inability to stop by and check if their TV is capable of receiving high def. 

The physical presence really does matter when it comes to people you care about. My mom came and visited me in September, which was great and I would love another visit, but being able to stop by her house is something I really miss.

While my mom is the main source of my current pining, I also miss my friends. I don't talk to most of you nearly often enough, and I know that's completely my fault. Marc calls me every once in awhile, as does Adam. Kevin sends me a random text message now and then. I talk with Remy on the phone and text with him all the time. None of this is the same as hanging out though. None of it is the same as friends just stopping by the apartment/condo/house to say hey and chill. 

If we were still in California, I bet most of my friends would have been by the house to celebrate Cinco de Mayo tonight. We would have had beer and made margaritas. Or at least attempted to. 

I did nothing to celebrate the holiday. No friends came over. I got a text from Kevin and that was it.

Again, it's not homesickness I'm having, because it's not California I miss. It's the people there. Maybe I should go visit sometime. I thought I'd never step foot in Santa Clarita again, but it will probably happen. More than once. Sadly."

It really is sad this image ever got a bad rap. Originally, in it's square orientation, it stood for ""Luck, Love, Light and Life"". The four ""L"" shapes from each word. 

Of course, turn it on it's side: 
<img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Nazi_Swastika.svg/200px-Nazi_Swastika.svg.png"">

And it's two ""S"" shapes overlapping and changes it's meaning completely.

Try to look at the first image disassociating it from any of it's negative uses and admire it for it's simplicity, it's childlike image (pinwheel) and it's meaning. Wouldn't it have made for a nice ""good luck"" and happiness in life symbol? The four words it stands for bring forth great feelings.

I want to bring the Swastika back, but I highly doubt I could convince people it was for Luck, Love, Light and Life rather than racism and intolerance."

"event","I decided to download an eBook reader for my iPhone the other day and remembered... I love reading!

I installed it and then downloaded ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" because I had been meaning to read it since long before I heard that a movie was coming out. Now that the movie is on DVD, I felt it was finally freakin' time to make that happen. Since it IS a short story I was able to read it in an evening. 

My first ""paper"" book read and completed this year! Outstanding! I've already queued up plenty more books to start reading. With torrents, I can pretty much find anything I'm looking for, and for free. Well, illegally for free.

So then I thought, ""why stop at books?""

I found and installed a comic book reader. Oh my Buddha this is the most amazing thing I could have done with my phone! I have downloaded and synced all of Preacher, most of Hellboy, all of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, V for Vendetta and The Dark Tower. I'm downloading Hellblazer and Marvel Civil War! This is going to rock. Hard core."

<i>I answered this in Remy's blog, but I'll answer again here for the rest of my friends.</i>

I agree with Remy when he says he trusts the BBC's selection. After all, we loved Christopher Eccleston and didn't want David Tennant to have to take over, but then David grew on us and we're very sad to see him leave. I think Matt Smith will do a great job and I look forward to his portrayal.

With that said, if they had gone another route here are the actors I think could have done an amazing job:

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/"">Simon Pegg</a> - You know him from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. He's about to be in the new Star Trek. Yes, he's been on Doctor Who before, but who's to say they can't recycle the actor like they did with Freema Agyeman?

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/"">Bill Nighy</a> - You know him from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies (2 and 3) but he has also been alongside Simon in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and <i>really</i> showed his ""Doctor-ness"" as Slartibartfast in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He would be and older Doctor and after all of these younger men, I think it's about time they go back. Then again, Steven Moffet said it well when he said that now that the Doctor is getting older, he wants to seem younger.

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293509/"">Martin Freeman</a> - You know him from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as Arthur Dent and BBC's The Office. While he's got a nice long list of IMDb credentials, he's not very well known in the US, which to me makes him a great choice. He also had a cameo in Hot Fuzz.

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202603/"">Jack Davenport</a> - You know him from Pirates of the Caribbean (all three) and he is the only one of my choices that was not in Hot Fuzz. He was also in a very unknown American show called ""Swingtown"" (of which my wife and I are huge fans) and in the BBC version of ""Coupling"" (which is the BBC equivolent of ""Friends"", but better.)

I think any of these men would do a fine job if any of them were willing to commit themselves to the show. I know Simon Pegg recently said in an interview he wouldn't want to play the Doctor because he loves sitting down every Saturday to watch as a fan and is enjoying doing movies at the moment. This doesn't mean he couldn't be convinced when Matt Smith moves on."

I've also decided to make books a key part of my new year. I'm adding a resolution to top this list with listening to 20 audiobooks and reading 1 printed book cover to cover!

<li>The Hobbit
<li>Fellowship of the Ring
<li>The Two Towers
<li>Return of the King
<li>Contact
<li>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
<li>Through the Looking Glass
<li>Curious Case of Benjamin Button
<li>Peter Pan
<li>(unabridged) Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Listened to the abridged version accidentally)"

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">In 2008:

    * I will learn to exercise regularly.
    * I will keep off all weight I lose this year.
    * I will keep one job in Vermont.
    * I will keep up on my house chores.

In May 2007 I weighed 327 lbs.
In December of 2007 I weighed 295.5 lbs.
My car was broken into and then shortly after I got fired.
This morning I weighed 316 lbs.</font></blockquote>So today I would like to review those statements.

* I exercised more than I had in the previous year. More regularly as well. Not ""regularly"" like I resolved, but more so than in the past. I count that as a win.

* I started the year at 316 pounds and ended it at about 328. That is a fail. I made it up to 340 and once I started going down I did not go back up, so at least that's a partial win. Still counting it as a fail.

* I did not keep one job in Vermont... not exactly at least, but when I did get the job I kept for more than a week, I kept it until the end of the year. (First job: TrueGreen, lasted less than a week in the field on my own. Second job: Dishwasher, lasted about a week and a day.) I got the Papa John's job on the day I quit TrueGreen. In fact, I quit TrueGreen because I got the call for the Papa John's job. I'm still at Papa John's. That's close enough to a win for me.

* Fail. I am a horrible husband. I'm still trying for this one though.

2008 Resolution Recap: 2 Win, 2 Fail

<b>2009</b>

This year I would like to present new resolutions... 

* <b>Follow my meal plan.</b> Even if I waiver, to jump back on. To not give up on it because of a bad day, week, or even month. The only exception would be if I decide to change the diet I am following, but the rules still apply to the new diet.

* <b>Follow my exercise routine.</b> Same deal here. If I miss a day, week, or month, to not give up and just get back into the swing of it. I'm starting it out easy, and will add more difficulty and regularity as I get better at it. If I'm still only walking 3 days a week by the end of the year, but I've kept it up (and gone back to it when I stop), then I can count it as a win. I get an extra point if I'm giving myself a rigorous workout 6 days a week (possible example: riding my bike for 1.5 hours each day).

* <b>Get Shit Done.</b> This is the new motto of 2009 for me. I don't know what's going to get done, but whatever it is, better get done. Some possible things to get done: Get Zinfandel Photography going, get accepted to and begin classes at UVM, get a job that I enjoy and pays well, et al. One or all of these can fall out of my awareness, as long as something meaningful gets done. Bonus point for each major thing that gets done. 

There we go, 3 resolutions. All lofty goals, but all attainable. Notice I'm not including ""loss weight"" or ""get fit"" on my list because those should be the outcome of the first two goals. I don't care if I don't lose weight, but I do care if I form a positive daily routine. All three of these are to promote that. 

I also won't say, ""Take __ photos a day"" or ""Get Zinfandel Photography into _____ arts & craft fair"" because those aren't necessarily where I'll want to take my photography in 2009. I believe both above statements will be goals along the way to ""get shit done"" with photography, but I can't say that's the way it will happen."

 WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A number of atheists and non-religious organizations want Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to God and religion.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington, the plaintiffs demand that the words ""so help me God"" not be added to the end of the president's oath of office.

In addition, the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss God and religion.

An advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by Michael Newdow, a California doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005.

Joining Newdow in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism, including the American Humanist Association, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and atheist groups from Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Florida.

The new lawsuit says in part, ""There can be no purpose for placing 'so help me God' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God, other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists.""

Newdow said references to God during inauguration ceremonies violate the Constitution's ban on the establishment of religion.

Newdow and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television. As atheists, they contend, having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized.

""Plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny,"" according to the lawsuit.

Among those named in the lawsuit are Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, who is expected to swear in the new president; the Presidential Inauguration Committee; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California; and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander, Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe Jr.

The two ministers scheduled to participate in the ceremony also are named: the Rev. Rick Warren and the Rev. Joseph Lowery. The document includes a quotation from Warren on atheists: ""I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, 'I don't need God.' ""

Newdow told CNN that he didn't name President-elect Barack Obama in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony, he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs.

""If he chooses to ask for God's help, I'm not going to challenge him,"" Newdow said. ""I think it's unwise.""

Newdow said that as a member of a racial minority, Obama should have respect for atheists, who also are members of a minority.

Newdow said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers.

""The message here is, we who believe in God are the righteous, the real Americans,"" he said.

Newdow said it's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good.

He acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful.

""I have no doubt I'll lose,"" he said, adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references."

"event","Mat and I, on the eve of 2005, decide that it was to be ""a whole new year to fuck shit up"". We succeeded. He both got married and divorced, I met and got engaged to Athena, he met V, I got my first apartment with Athena, and in all we totally fucked up our entire lives perspectives. It was the beginning to new lives. Lots happened that year.

Now, with 2009 approaching, Mat has been talking about the new saying for this year. He threw a couple at me, and I think he personally ended up with a different one, but the one that stuck out to me was, ""2009 - A year to get shit done."" 

This seems to ring very true for how I want this new year to turn out. Mat is graduating from college this quarter so he'll be entering the real world finally and it's about time for him to take that first step toward what he wants to do with his life; while I intend to finally get back to school. I'm scared, and not sure how this endeavor is going to turn out (or even how it's going to happen), but I'm turning 28 at the start of the year, so it's really about time that I get my B.A. I graduated high school at 18, so this will be my tenth year out of high school without a B.A. I do have my Associates (also something from 2005), but I kind of stopped there. Maybe it was because I was in the process of falling in love and being married. I don't know.

I also want to find the motivation I've been lacking for all these years to actually ""get shit done"" that I have been putting on my to-do list for a decade--like, get in shape.

This isn't really a New Years Resolution, but more of an outlook on life I would like to adopt. If we really must put it into resolution form, this is mine: To Adopt the ""Get Shit Done"" mantra for the new year and put it into motion. There are no specifics of what needs to get done, but at the end of 2009 I want to be able to look back and say, ""Yeah, I got shit done."""

"event","Bruce Campbell has made a new movie called <i>My Name Is Bruce</i> where a town mistakes him for Ash from <i>Evil Dead</i>, <i>Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn</i>, and <i>Army of Darkness</i> and asks him to stop a creature. 

Sounds a bit like Three Amigos, Bruce Campbell style, and I can't wait to see it.

I just found an interview with him regarding this movie that all my fellow BC fans will be sure to enjoy. <a href=""http://www.cinematical.com/2008/11/03/interview-bruce-campbell-my-name-is-bruce/"">You can check it out here!</a>

And after you read that, don't forget to check out his <a href=""http://www.bruce-campbell.com/"">official site</a>.


Oh, and one last thing:

<b>Bruce will be making a stop at the Nuart in Los Angeles with a screening and Q&A!</b> So! All my Southern California friends, please go and let me know how it is. 

(And Zach, you aren't left out... he's hitting up Chicago as well.)

Check out that official site for more info."

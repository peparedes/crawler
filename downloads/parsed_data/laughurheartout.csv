"event","<strong>I believe in love, the feeling almighty, creator of heaven and earth<br /><br /></strong>This is from Sir Yol. He is my Fil 12 teacher.<br /><br /><strong>1. One book that changed your life</strong><br />I really could not say that any book changed my life, but one book that did inspire me was Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in heaven. Yes, it is quite a stereotypical answer. But if you have read it, you will no longer be scared to die. I am not saying that you will want to die(only accounting textbooks can do that.) but you will gain comfort, knowing that in death, before you live again, you will have the chance to meet the important people in your life whom you have taken for granted when you were still flesh and not ash.<br /><strong><br />2. One book you have read more than once</strong><br />There are many. I have read all four Dan Brown books more than once, and all Harry Potter books more than ten times.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />3. One book you want on a deserted island<br /></strong>There is this book called The Egypt Game. If I am not mistaken, the author is Zilpha Keatley Snyder. I want a book that is not boring yet not too heavy. Goodness knows how much there is to see in a deserted island, and how many times I have to walk around carrying all my stuff. I suggest you read it too.<br /><strong><br />4. One book that made you laugh</strong><br />I laugh when I read my French textbook, mainly because I have not a clue on what i am reading.<br /><br /><strong>5. One book that made you cry<br /></strong>Accounting textbooks always make me cry and want to die(hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br /><strong>6. One book you wish had been written</strong><br />I wish there was a book about a girl who lived during the Holocaust and how she lived through it all. Oh wait, there is.<br /><br /><strong>7. One book you wish had never been written<br /></strong>I wish that Confessions of an Heiress was never written. It's highly impractical. if we want to see the real confessions of Paris Hilton, pick up a copy of National Enquirer, or other dailies and tabloids.<br /><br /><strong>8. One book you are currently reading<br /></strong>None, for now.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />9. One book you have been meaning to read</strong><br />Memoirs of a Geisha.<br /><br /><strong>10. Taya! Ikaw, oo, ikaw na nagbabasa. Gawin mo naman ang ehersisyong ito o. Babasahin ko.</strong><br /><br />"

at 1 second before the final bell, Doug Kramer pulled a really fantastic shot, just when the Thomasians thought that they had it. You could see the shock.

and the euphoria for the Ateneans!


GO ATENEO!!!!"

"event","Darn, I'm a sucker when it comes to thinking of titles. You might have noticed that the titles of my previous blogs are mostly Hahaha, Harharhar, Bored, etc. Haaaay, help me think of better titles would you? Okay. New Year's Resolution number ONE: Think of better titles.

I really have lots to thank for in 2005.
First of all, it was in January 2005 that I got my acceptance letter in Ateneo. I never thought that I would be accepted to this university mainly because I guessed most of the answers in the entrance exam. Hahaha. Oh, it was also in January that I bought my N6600 phone. Yes, I know it's not all the fad anymore today, but hey, my phone's my life.

February was not very eventful, except for its last day, Feb 28, 2005. This was the day that we had our thesis defense. Yes, I was really really nervous that time. There were two (or were there three?) other groups that defended their theses as well, but I just feel that I am not yet prepared. Well, I am very happy to tell you that it was very successful. We actually shouted and embraced each other after the defense. No one minded the noise; it was already closer to six in the evening and the school was practically empty.

I had my last quarterly exam in March 2-4(naks, tanda?!) and I should say that I have done pretty well. The best part was the two-week break after the exams before graduation practices. Then, I was told that I was a first honor and was third in the batch for the fourth quarter! yay. Also, the Top ten graduating students were announced and I was among them. What made me really ahppy about this is the sense of accomplishment; you see, third year and fourth year grades are computed 50-50 for graduation awards, and I was 23rd in the class(not the batch) during third year. During graduation, I was 6th during graduation. Gets?

April and May were fun, mainly because it was vacation. The main event was the arrival of the yearbook. It was highly commended and I was editor-in-chief. Need I say more?

June started a new life for me, very far away from the walls of my high school. From June until December, I have met new friends and missed old ones. I survived tough classes and aced others. I joined orgs and actively participated in some. I made feature articles, studied Botany and Physics, cursed my way through Math 11, wrote reaction papers, evaluation papers, literary papers and other kinds of papers. But the best part of course, was learning to be independent and patient. Developing myself in many, many aspects(okaaaaay, going cheesy here).

I just want to thank my friends, special mentions to my ever laughtrip blockmates Geoc, Gela, Pauline, Drea, Leinard, Jelai, Kat, Den, Telle, Sunshine and all of G2, my sweet English blockmates Cla, Joyce, DJ, Bea Arcega, Bea Torricer and all of R07, my high school friends, and everyone else.

Wish me luck in 2006."

The good thing about Physics was that it lasted only 30 minutes and all who came were given extra points.

I had a fun time kanina with my laughtrip blockmates...We met because of our barkada exchange gifts and you know what i got...nobody knows yet. It turns out that Jelai picked my name and she was not able to make today...Okay. I picked her name too! What a coincidence! See you next year Jelai! and of course my other blockmates. After the gift-giving, we went to eat lunch at World Topps. The chicken curry was spicy, but so?...

Hahaha...what a day, after lunch, we walked all the way to Pauline's dorm in ISO, gosh too far, legs ache...And now, I'm here sitting once again in front of one of the 80+ computers in RSF...hehehe...

Blockmates, let do this again some other day, okie...Maybe by then we will be able to go to Gela's house...hehe...

...END...
wELL, first of all, I went to school at 10 against my will. Because of Cla. Because I am uto-uto. Because of the stupid handouts. When I got here, I realized I will be here without Cla because the skank fell asleep again... #&*^($#*(*?!
Anyway, i just decided to write the Filipino paper to kill time. Good thing I met Leinard at the RSF, so I had some help in making the paper. It was already 12 noon when I met Cla. What happened to the 10 am call time Cla? Haha, just kidding. So I gave her the handouts, which I paid, thank you very much and then I went back to RSF where Leinard was still making his paper. Since the room was already full, I decided to eat lunch first at Kenny. I then spotted the banana split and therefore, decided to enjoy it. Yum! At about 1:45pm, I decided to go back to AdMU and try coming back to RSF. Leinard was already gone(making a two-page, double-spaced paper in 3 hours? unthinkable for me) but Nica was still there.

That's it. Oh, I wish I could cut physics tomorrow, did you know that nobody in our class got the twenty point problem? Yikes! Wish me luck as I get the paper tomorrow! Wish I could have a good Christmas. Now, I need to stop here because I have to enjoy the Net's other amenities...haha.

"event","because of incessant demands for more details(and because I have nothing to do), I have obliged to write the details of my ultra-fun christmas party last Monday...

I arrived in front of De La Costa at about 7 in the morning and then the driver helped me carry the cakes I brought for the party. Ana and Wix were already sitting outside and Jiza has arrived as well. We decided to fix the room (I think it's called Galang Fajardo Room) for the party... We were amazed (exaggerated) at the grand piano located inside. Some of us who knew how to play it (yours truly NOT included) mesmerized us with their talents. i had a feeling this party was going to be fun. More and more people soon arrived (Sabina, Bea Arcega, Juapao, Bea Torricer, Dino, Nina, Denise, and others) until the whole class (ooops, not whole pala because some were not there)was complete.(incomplete pala...anyway, all who planned to arrive were already there...ayan.)moving on...

Of course, we started the event with a prayer, by Sabina...

Then Ms. Quong gave some announcements regarding the English ARP. And then. the Fun started. THE END.

Bitin?

Okay, Ms Quong sponsored the first game, which is, of all games, Human Bingo. It was really really fun, with everybody shouting and running arround the room, waving pen and paper. Anyway, Mhe-Ann won the game and she received a bag of Doritos, care of Ms. Quong. the next game was longest line and the class was divided into two.  We did not win(how sad) but it was really funny...because, the room was not long enough, the line kept curving until no one was sure how long the lines were.

I don't remember if there were other games(damn the short attention span) oh before longest line was longest voice, and Karl won the game with a very long, record-breaking nine seconds.

The most favorite game however was Newspaper dance...the pairs were(incomplete), dino and jiza, peter and monique, elise and raymond, karl and jay, dj and juapao, amor and ...ooops, forgot who amor's partner was... and some other pairs I forgot to mention. Apparently, I no longer need to explain how and why this game was fun.

yay, eating time...lots and lots of food, hard to enumerate...

oh and then missy distributed lit handouts and gave announcements...

and then exchange gifts, and then it's over.(How sad)

but before everyone left, there was a block picture taking...sorry na lang ung mga wala, u really missed a lot. these are just some of the events that make you proud to be part of a class, everyone was cooperative and the party was no bore...I'll definitely miss this day...

R07 rules!

Hahaha!"

"event","I enjoyed my English block's Christmas Party this morning...hahaha! Yay! I'm definitely going to miss these people next year when we are no longer classmates in English and Lit...haaaaay.
What a way to start the day! it is so fun and ... well, fun...no other words can describe it. The best part however was the cancellation of classes for Wednesday...Oh, and did mention that Lit long test is no longer a problem coz it's cancelled...Yay! Oh well... There are downsides, however, like the fact the Xmas break is not really break...More of a study period...Really!

Well, Physics scores were not yet given and it's kinda not a good news...I wish i could have gotten it sooner, and did I also mention that nobody got the correct answer for the 20-point problem?...What a test, and in the other class, someone got a 49/50, wonder who the hell that was...want to strangle that person for being so damn good...grrrrrrr ... @%^&$%#!

haha...

I wonder if I got a good score, and by good I mean a passing score, kelangan nang babaan ang standards ko for this subject..It's so damn far from Botany, which I nearly aced. Ayan, na-miss ko tuloy ang mga plants na pinag-aaralan namin noon...

It's almost Christmas...am already expecting lots of gifts!

Oh, by the way, Joyce, thank you for citing an excerpt from my previous blog entries to your blog entries...I'm quite flattered.. haha...

Hoy Cla, sayaw kasi ng sayaw kaya nagkakasakit...hahaha! 
You missed a lt during the Christmas Party...

Smile!

"event","Eeeeyow. due to the disaster of the physics exam yesterday, i wasnt able to write well, not that there was anything worth writing anyway...I'm here now in pasay, waiting for my mother who will come from Batangas. hehe...

oh did i forget to tell you that something funny (and ouchy0 happened) yesterday morning? Haha... i fell off a trike! Yikes...My back hurt and my head ached for hours after that, but hey, it's a learning experience...hehe...

Cla looked haggard when I saw her, haha, sleepless ba? She had a ballet recital yesterday, with Joyce. Wawa naman sila, juggling schoolwork and ballet. You should have seen their faces, looking like drugged out bums. Anyway, we had day 2 of reporting in lit and missy's sister shared some insights on Emily Dickinson's poem. She's really good! Anyway, we talked about the class play Missy is planning to organize...hehe...wink*

Well, after the disaster of Physics, I had no longer any intention of enjoying life, but hey, what the heck!
I just really really hope that Sir gives partial points haha... see, i am so over it I can laugh about it now!

The Physics test was excruciating! I was totally blanked out that's why i did not get the solution to such an easy number. Oh you idiot! Dudders, 20 points down the drain, and what if i did not get the answer to all other numbers? I hope sir gives partial points...What a way to end this horrible, horrible week.

I can't stop thinking about the test... Okay, keep your calm... Oh no! Aaaaaaaaaaaaarggghhhhhhhhhh! (Total panic mode...) to think that I have studied almost all night. And what? for nothing! Huhuhu...

I just want to go home.

I can't live like this.

"event","Hahaha... I have no more classes today! Yeah...
Oh yeah, yesterday had been fun, we watched the continuation of Bayaning 3rd world in Filipino. Yes, and because we did not like the movie, it served as a venue fopr more hirits and British Accent impersonations from yours truly...hahaha...The blockmates just love Bracken's lines...hehe. 

I hate Math. Since this sem. Well, 95% of the hate factor comes from the prof. I won't tell you who...Yesterday's lesson is a very good example. Do you know that we spent 20 plus minutes discussing one number alone!? I mean, it's not even the biggest deal. We spent half of the veinte minutos staring at each other because, well, none of us knew the answer and the teacher wouldn't share hers...Doesn't she understand that when we are quiet for more than ten minutes, apparently nobody knows the answer? 

Anyway, Math ended well despite this commotion, because the teacher had enough sense to return our long test papers. Yours truly got a B+ (Yay!) with the mistakes being focused on the last number. Not bad for the first long exam. However, the real deal here is my friend Gela. Congrats Gela! Hahaha!

Today started out quite fine. English was fine. Lit was ,as always, fun(although Cla won't agree) and Physics was short. PE, however was even shorter...haha! I ate lunch with Joyce and then Cla sat down with us for PE, and we went to Starbucks where we met my blockmates and all was fine and now here I am typing this blog. Not much of a day huh?! We'll see...hehe.

"event","I told you yesterday that although the day was pretty uneventful, there is still a lot of time for something to happen...and surprisingly, something did happen. You see my friend, last night, as I was enjoying my two-piece burger steak and large fries at jollibee, who else should walk in but two close friends from high school! Yay, JOY and JEAN! I think I last saw them, like, three or four months ago...I really don't remember, but it was really a night of kwen2hans and kumustahans. Yes. A little short, of course, because Joy had to go study for a long test (Physics, I think) and I was still in panic mode because of the Math long test.

That was that.

Anyway, I slept early last night because I had no choice...hehe...Really! I just fell asleep and when I woke up, it was already 4:30 in the morning. Yes...Since, my dorm room is not really conducive for studying, I decided to sleep a bit more and wake up at 7:30 to study in McDonald's. Well, I slept maybe a little later; hence, I came to McDo at 8 and ate my breakfast. I tried to study, but really, I think I've had enough of this lesson...It was too easy, it's scary... I stayed in McDo for 3 hours, trying in vain to open my notes but always ending up perusing some other stuff. At 11 I decided to go to Ateneo, where I've had to endure about twenty minutes of solitude until Sunshine and Gela came over from their PE class. Well, did you think we would study? NO. WE chatted and chatted until Leinard and Pauline arrived and it was time for Filipino.

Filipino time was not bad, we had to go to the Faura AVR to watch a film...I think it's entitled Bayaning 3rd World. Yep. Well, we were not able to finish the movie straightaway since it was tad too long. But not too hard to endure. There are quite some comic moments and some OA fight scenes...reasons for coming up with stupid hirits from yours truly.

Another one and a half hour break would mean that I was, after all, able to study for Math. Wrong. We did study for a little while, but being the group of ADD-inflicted people that we were, we ended up playing cards. I was waiting for Cla's text to arrive so I would have an excuse to study, but my phone was in one of its ""rejective"" moods. Du-h. Well, what the heck, playing cards is FUN! FUN! FUN!

Finally, math time. Groan. Test time. Surprisingly, though, the exam was quite doable, if not very easy. I managed to finish this one before 4pm, which, like, was just an hour. I took the time to review though, since I don't want careless mistakes to ruin the supposedly-easy exam. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for at least a B, and if good fortune really permits, might be an A. 

Haha. what a day... In the long run, it's not entirely bad...save for the three boooooooring hours in McDo. Im quite glad I had the opportunity to share the day with my blockmates. It's not everyday that we play cards. Hehehe....."

Last weekend was pretty boring, we just went to Batangas to visit family...
Yesterday, I spent the night watching television...I slept early...
This morning, I woke up early for school...

Yeah, like that's so important...
Whatever...anyway, I was here by 6.30 with nothing to do. Cla promised that she would meet me, but I could not find her. Maybe she went to the chapel... So I just went straight to the classroom even if it's apparent that I am the only one there since we have a free cut for our first period. I was just sitting there, sipping by Peppermint Mocha Frap like some good-for-nothing loser. I thought about reading our Lit handouts, but I was too sleepy and bored to do so. Just as I was about to go crazy in the very welcoming atmosphere of the classroom, Bea Arcega arrived. Yay! Now, I have company. We went to the caf and ate our favorite potato salad...where we also met friend Geoc. After eating, we found Cla in the classroom.

Lit was fun yadda yadda...

Physics was more fun blah blah blah...
 
PE was okay lalalalala...

Physics Lab was...(okay, I don't really know what Physics Lab was because we focused on the experiment)

now, i am sitting here in front of this computer...

yeah, boring day, isn't it?

well, the day has a few more hours left...maybe something worth writing about will happen while I enjoy studying for Math...hahaha

Long Test for Math tom...

How would those who once treaded the Math classroom with auras of pride and optimism fare as the lesson concludes?

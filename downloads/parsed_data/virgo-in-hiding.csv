"event","the Romantic
Test finished!  
you chose BY - your Enneagram type is FOUR. 

""I am unique""

Romantics have sensitive feelings and are warm and perceptive. 

How to Get Along with Me 

Give me plenty of compliments. They mean a lot to me. 
Be a supportive friend or partner. Help me to learn to love and value myself. 
Respect me for my special gifts of intuition and vision. 
Though I don't always want to be cheered up when I'm feeling melancholy, I sometimes like to have someone lighten me up a little. 
Don't tell me I'm too sensitive or that I'm overreacting! 
What I Like About Being a Four 

my ability to find meaning in life and to experience feeling at a deep level 
my ability to establish warm connections with people 
admiring what is noble, truthful, and beautiful in life 
my creativity, intuition, and sense of humor 
being unique and being seen as unique by others 
having aesthetic sensibilities 
being able to easily pick up the feelings of people around me 
What's Hard About Being a Four 

experiencing dark moods of emptiness and despair 
feelings of self-hatred and shame; believing I don't deserve to be loved 
feeling guilty when I disappoint people 
feeling hurt or attacked when someone misundertands me 
expecting too much from myself and life 
fearing being abandoned 
obsessing over resentments 
longing for what I don't have 
Fours as Children Often 

have active imaginations: play creatively alone or organize playmates in original game s 
are very sensitive 
feel that they don't fit in 
believe they are missing something that other people have 
attach themselves to idealized teachers, heroes, artists, etc. 
become antiauthoritarian or rebellious when criticized or not understood 
feel lonely or abandoned (perhaps as a result of a death or their parents' divorce) 
Fours as Parents 

help their children become who they really are 
support their children's creativity and originality 
are good at helping their children get in touch with their feelings 
are sometimes overly critical or overly protective 
are usually very good with children if not too self-absorbed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alot... well, 2 main things have happened. About 2 weeks ago&nbsp;there was a Incident with the owner of these apts. I was at work at the time, But this is what happened. John took out the trash for us. And while he was doing this, he smoked a ciggarette, after dumping the trash he wallked to our door, took the last few drags and put it out and put the butt in his pocket. Before he could get through the door the owner was at his back yelling, what are you doing?! Who are you?! You've got no right to be out here.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wyn comes otu to see whats going on and the guy starts yelling at wyn. Wyn sarts asking whats going on, and the guy shots off says the are loittering and that we are going to be evicted. Wyn ask what grounds and the only response the guy gives in that he is going to call the cops.
&nbsp; so, I'm at work right? My neighbor comes out to see whats up and the owner starts yelling at her. who are you?! where do you live?! Go Back in your house! So she comes to get me.
Last night we were served with not eviction papers but a search and detainer warrent with nothing more than Names of the plantiff(porter realities)&nbsp;and defendents(us), a date to appear in court, and a PPSV serv fee&nbsp;$45&nbsp;stamped across the top. Nothing about eviction or even&nbsp; specifiying why we are being called into court.
&nbsp;Needless to say i've been on a brand new level of pisstivity for the last 2 weeks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope all is well with all in the universe.I'm wiating to go to court."

<P>I've always felt like a rasin in the oatmeal. Harrassed growing up for haveing a white sounding name.&nbsp;&nbsp;Told i actted to white.&nbsp; I stood by and watched&nbsp; tothers suffer the same thing.&nbsp; 95% of the time, those doing the harrasing were not white. They were black.</P>
<P>&nbsp; A local bus driver told me how growing up he coudlnt even buy a coke. When he tried the store fell dead silent , the mostly white customers fell silent. When a few guys started to shout at the kid the store clerk took him&nbsp;into the store roomed, dragging him, and asked&nbsp;who sent him there.&nbsp; He said no one i just was thristy. The clerk asked why did you ask for a coke. The bus driver said he was so scared he was almost cring. He&nbsp; had just seen&nbsp;other kids(white) with it and it looked good. The clerk told him&nbsp;to take it and get his lil nigger ass out of his store and never come back, and&nbsp;Never to ask for a coke again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, i can walk into the grocery and buy whatever i want. It wasnt like that less than a century ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;Today,&nbsp; I can basically go wherever i want. But racism i s still&nbsp;&nbsp;alive and well.&nbsp; We experince freedom without equallity everyday and i dont mean blacks alone.</P>

You are brave in<br>the sense that you always do what is right and<br>are not afraid to take the harder, more<br>peaceful path. Material things mean little to<br>you because you understand that there is so<br>much more to life than them. You are generally<br>very open minded and serious, but arrogance can<br>creep in (be wary of that). Though you are a<br>very loving person, relationships do not<br>interest you (though many admire your<br>attractive inner light and beauty). You are a<br>good advice giver, moderator, and teacher. In<br>tense situations you tend to stay calm and<br>centered, not leatting your emotions get the<br>best of you. Truley you are a  follower of the<br>Light.

"event","<CENTER><B>Virgo</B><BR>August 23 - September 22 
<P></CENTER>Virgo is ruled by the Planet Mercury, and as portrayed in ancient Roman mythology, Mercury wasn't one to sit still for long. This swift-footed god was a bundle of energy, both physically and mentally, and that pretty much sums up the Virgin's makeup. A Virgo's brain is in overdrive most of the time, which is why these folks get so much done. Those born under this Sign are also able communicators and use their mental acuity to maximum advantage. All of this brainpower can make Virgins prone to skepticism, and can even lead to the kind of overthink which surely leads to overkill. Thankfully, though, Virgos are also a studious lot and can temper their worst impulses with a bit of careful analysis. Virgos enjoy studying a situation in great detail, whether it's a work project or a friendship. Virgins are truly interested in understanding things. The bane of many Virgos is the perfectionism which can get in the way of their usual clear thinking. 'I'm not a perfectionist; I'm discriminating!' a Virgo would say, happy in the knowledge that their taste is unparalleled. Along those lines, Virgos are also neat and clean, save for the occasional sloppy Virgin <FONT size=4>(they do exist).</FONT> Virgins are also reliable and practical and oh-so-useful to have around.

 The Element associated with Virgo is Earth, and in keeping with that, most Virgos are grounded, salt-of-the-earth types. The flash and dash can go to others, since Virgos would much rather be humble and easy-going. That said, Virgins do enjoy material possessions and are (dare we say?) picky about what they bring into their lives. Some might even go as far as calling them self-centered, but it's really more of a desire to surround themselves with what's right -- for them. This knack for discernment also serves Virgins well in business, where their decisions are usually dead-on. Those born under this Sign are eminently sensible and use their critical eye well. While Virgins can be worrywarts, they do their best to temper these impulses. However, if this nervousness goes unchecked, it can lead to hypochondria, that ugly skeleton in the Virgo's closet. For that reason, Virgos are extremely health conscious, to the point of being storehouses of information on diet and hygiene. Many Virgos even choose a health or medical career so they won't miss a beat. </P>"

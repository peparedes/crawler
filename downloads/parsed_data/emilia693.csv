I think it's safe to say that I haven't written a live journal in about a year...
I think it's sooo interesting how we have all changed so much in the last year or so. I know I have. And i think it's a good thing. I'm just trying to figure out who I am... cuz just when I think i have it, a whole new side shows itself or I get a whole new emotion that i've never felt before. Keeps me on my toes I guess... but whatever..
To anyone who is accually reading this... I hope life is good and that you find something in your life that makes you unbeleivably happy! Remember... LIFE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT FOR EXPEREINCE.

Jason Mraz - I'm Yours

Well you done done me and you better felt it 
I tried to be chill but you so hot that i melted 
I fell right through the cracks and i'm tryin to get back 
before the cool done run out i'll be givin it my bestest 
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention 
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some 

i won't hesitate no more, 
no more, it cannot wait i'm yours 

Well open up your mind and see like me 
open up your plans and damn you're free 
look into your heart and you'll find love love love 
listen to the music of the moment maybe seen with me 
Ah, la peaceful melodie 
It's your god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved Loved 

So, i won't hesitate no more, 
no more, it cannot wait i'm sure 
there's no need to complicate our time is short 
this is our fate, i'm yours 

*scat* 

I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror 
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer 
my breath fogged up the glass 
and so I drew a new face and laughed 
I guess what I'm a sayin'is there ain't no better reason 
to rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons 
it's what we aim to do 
our name is our virtue 

I won't hesitate no more, no more 
it cannot wait, i'm sure 
(there's no need to complicate 
our time is short 
it cannot wait (this is our fate), i'm yours 2x 

no please don't complicate, our time is short 
this is our faith, im yours. 
no please don't hesitate no more, no more 
it cannot wait, the sky is yours!) 

well open up your mind and see like me 
open up your plans and damn you're free 
look into your heart and you'll find love love love love 
listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me 
i love one big family 
it's our god forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved 
open up your mind and see like me 
open up your plans and damn you're free 
look into your heart and you'll find love love love love 
listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me 
i love happy family 
it's our god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved 
listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me 
i love peaceful melodies 
it's our god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved..."

"event","Wowwwwwwwwww...
I almost forgot about this thing, can you beleive it?
Summer has just gone by soo fast and i've been really busy... But i've definatly learned a lesson over the past few weeks.. The only way to live is to live in the moment.  I had some close friends who were on the plane the skidded off the runway at peirson, and after that i realized... Living in the past is usless..but so is living in the future... How can u appreciate and learn from the past and at the same time look forward to the future when you dont even stop to appreciate wats right in front of you.  I've realized that life is a journey of learing and that learing is the thing we take for granted the most.  If it werent for learning, no one would be alive today.  So, this is why learning has become my main objective in life.  I'm not saying that im gonna become a hermit and read all day...cuz you definatly dont have to read in order to learn.  Im just gonna be paying more attention to everything in my life and appreciating it.  So next time ur angry or frustrated or even happy...stop and think how you can learn frmo this and you'll find urself relaxed and sincerly enlightened...

I kno that this all sounds a little philosophical...but its the only way that i was able to communicate this breakthrough...  And i just want to share it with everyone...

Live in the moments you create and just be...

Thrice - ""The Artist In The Ambulance""
 
 late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
 red light, can't stop so i spin the wheel
 my world goes black before i feel an angel lift me up
 and i open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white
 they flip the siren, hit the lights, close the doors and i am gone
 
 now i lay here owing my life to a stranger
 and i realize that empty words are not enough
 i'm left here with the question of just
 what have i to show except the promises i never kept?
 i lie here shaking on this bed, under the weight of my regrets
 
 [Chorus:]
 i hope that i will never let you down
 i know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound
 
 look around and you'll see that at times it feels like no one really cares
 it gets me down but i'm still gonna try to do what's right, i know that there's
 a difference between sleight of hand, and giving everything you have
 there's a line drawn in the sand, i'm working up the will to cross it and
 
 [Chorus]
 
 rhetoric can't raise the dead
 i'm sick of always talking when there's no change
 rhetoric can't raise the dead
 i'm sick of empty words, let's lead and not follow
 
 late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
 red light, can't stop so i spin the wheel
 my world goes black before i feel an angel steal me from the
 greedy jaws of death and chance, and pull me in with steady hands
 they've given me a second chance, the artist in the ambulance
 
 [Chorus]
 
 can we pick you off the ground, more than flashing lights and sound"

""Breathe (2 AM)""
Anna Nalick

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake,
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?,
I don't love him. Winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize,
Hypocrites. You're all here for the very same reason

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl.
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe... just breathe,

In May he turn 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day"", he sat down to the flask in his fist,
""Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year.""
Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while,
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles,
Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.

Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.
No one can find the rewind button, boys,
So cradle your head in your hands,
And breathe... just breathe,

There's a light at each end of this tunnel, 
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around.

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me, 
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand.
and breathe, just breathe
woah breathe, just breathe,
oh breathe, just breathe."

Well lifes kinda weird right now...getting back into the swing of things is a pain in the ass...but someone has to do it..lol..
Its scary to see people change around you...sometimes its for the better...sometimes for the worse...but it just reminds you that most of the time you cant help the change...and you feel helpless...
I dont like seeing some of the most important people in my life suffer...i want to help but i cant...im not trying to turn this into my problem or anything...its just how i feel...

So, all im gonna do is keep the love...thats a constant between friends...

On a happier note...i think optimism is wat im concentrating on right now...cant go wrong...

love you guys

p.s. I'm obsessed with this song right now...download!!!!

Goo Goo Dolls - Big Machine

Ecstasy is all you need
Living in the big machine
Oh you're so vain
Now your world is way too fast
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
And I'm aware
I'm in love and you don't care
Turn your anger into lust
I'm still here but you don't trust at all
And I'll be waiting
Love and sex and loneliness
Take what's yours and leave the rest
So I'll survive
God it's good to be alive
I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for you
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you

Still in love with all your sins
Where you stop and I begin
And I'll be waiting
Living like a house on fire
What you fear is your desire
It's hard to deal
I still love the way you feel
Now this angry little girl
Drowning in this petty world
Oh who you run to
Swallow all your bitter pills
That's what makes you beautiful
You're all or not
I don't need what you ain't got

I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for you
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you

I'm blind and waiting for you
I'm blind and waiting for you"

Think About Me
(John Rzeznik) 

You take a lot of chances with your feelings
No one really knows what you feel
And fiction is the only way you're dealing
You turn your pretty head if it gets real

You take it so slowly
And your eyes look so lonely
And it's only when you think about me
Oh yeah
When you think about me
Think about me

I got head don't let me sleep
You got secret I can't keep
You see a little stranger in your mirror
The girl you never know is what you fear
You take is to so slowly
And your eyes look so lonely
But it's only when you think about me

Oh yeah
When you think about me
Think about me
All you want is something I can't be
All you want from me is what you need
And I'm saying

You take it so slowly
And your eyes look so lonely
But it's only oh you, take it so slowly
Now it's only 'bout me
When you think about me
Think about me
When you think about me
Oh yeah
When you think about me
Think about me

I am the water, I am waves crashing onto you
I am the blank wave, I am the madness, the dark, the hunt, the cage, the race

I am desire for obligation, I am forever, but I could be never if thats what you want.
I am the desert, I am oasis for strength, the weakness for arguments sake
I am rejection, I am redemption, I am desire for obligation, 
I am one step closer for you
Please tell me when you're through, 
because I may not be through with you
You're loss to sustain, but I will remain and true to form. 
If this was the last breath I ever took would you take the time

Or would you know?

Becuase I am the water, I am waves crashing onto you
You could pretend to be, but you will kill me when you're through.

""Bohemian Rhapsody""

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows..."

I tried to show you, i loved you
but you turned away and i faced the cold
i tried to tell you how i feel
but this predicament was too much to hold

and everything everything, that i knew
i was forced to face again from the start
little pieces of my memory all were focused on
the belief that you would come back

im naked, im changin, im trying to find myself
in this mess of misconception and devotion to redemption
as i, 
turn my back to the mirror

you were the sparkle in my eye
but this curtain of tears changed it all
i didnt understand how you
could go from hot to cold so fast how could u

make me, tease me
pull me away from wat was rightfully ours
i tried to cover up the pain with smiles and goodbyes
but you changed it anyways

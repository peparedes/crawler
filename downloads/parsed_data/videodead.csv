Babe I got you bad
Dreaming blood-wet dreams
only madmen have
Baby I got you bad
I wish to God I never had
And it makes me feel so sad,
O, Baby I got you bad
Yeah, Babe I got you bad

I long for your kiss,
for the turn of your mouth
Your body is a long thing
Heading South
And I don't know what I'm talking about
All of my words have gone mad
Ah, baby I got you bad

Seasons have gone wrong
And I lay me down in a bed of snow
Darling, since you've been gone
well my hands, they don't know where to go
And all of my teeth are bared,
I got you so much I'm scared
Ah, baby I got you bad

With the sweep of my hand
I undid all the plans
that explode at the moment I kissed you
on your small hot mouth
and your caramel limbs
that are hymns to the glory that is you.
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Baby I got you bad

Smoke bilowing from the bridges
and the rivers we swim in are boiling
My hands are reaching for you everywhere
but you're not there, or you're recoiling
and a weary moon dangles from a cloud
Oh honey, I know it's not allowed
To say I got you bad.

I got you bad...
I got you bad...
I got you bad...

Once upon a time, my advice to you would have been go out and find yourself a whore
But I guess I've grown up, because I don't give that kind of advice anymore

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt

I was 27 when I figured out that blowing my brains wasn't the answer
So I decided, maybe I should find a way to make this world work out for me
And my good friend Paul was 83 when he told me; that ""To love is to feel pain""
And I thought about that then and I've thought about that again and again

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt

""To love is to feel pain"" there ain't no way around it
The very nature of love is to grieve when it is over
The secret to a happy ending is knowing when to role the credits
Better role them now before something else goes wrong
No, it's a wonderful world, if you can put aside the sadness
And hang on to every ounce of beauty upon you
Better take the time to know it there ain't no way around it
If you feel anything at all

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt

So if what you have is working for you, or you think that it can stand a reasonable chance, and whatever's broken seems fixable and nothing's beyond repair
If you still think about each other and smile before you remember how screwed up it's gotten or maybe dream of a time less rotten
Remember, it ain't too late to take a deep breath and throw yourself into it with everything you got

It's great to be alive

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt"

We were drivin through West Texas
The land of beef and pork
Where they tend the hides of leather
We wear back in New York
In a pasture, along a roadside
Behind a brokedown shack
On a dusky side of evening
We saw a figure dressed in black

And we don't mean to sound like we're trippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Hey Lou, ""Is that you?""
She said as we pulled to the shoulder
He just said, ""Go screw.""
And then he turned and tipped one over
Under a spitshine Western sky
The color of blue varnish
Hey it's like Fellini
Actually I'm thinkin more like Jim Jarmusch

And we can't say how much we've been sippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

I got cops on the cell
I said I got a little story to tell
Lou Reed is in the cow pen
They said, Oh no! Not again!

And we hope our perceptions isn't slippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Cow tippin
Cow tippin
Cow tippin
You really think that was Lou Reed?
Cow tippin
I'm sure it was, he was wearing black Levis
Cow tippin
I thought he was a vegetarian
Cow tippin
He's just tippin them over, he wasn't eating them
Cow tippin
Oh
Cow tippin"

Well Nashville had country music but Memphis had the soul
Lord, the white boy had the rhythm and that started rock and roll
And I was here when it happened don't you all think I ought to know
I was here when it happened, yeah, yeah, yeah
I watched Memphis give birth to rock and roll, Lord, lord yeah.

Well the cat named Elvis Be-Bopped in to sun right off the street
Sang 'Blue Moon' of OKY but he did it with a brand new beat
Guess he sought him a sleeping world and out there by surprise
Jack 'em up, you rang them out and he' hung 'em out to dry
I was there when it happened, don't you all think I ought to know, lord, lord
Yeah I was here when it happened I watched Memphis give birth to rock and roll
Here's kinda the way it happened

Well the drummer boy was the beatin' on the drums a rockin' and a goin' wild
The real city slicker was clickin' and clackin' and doin' it in a different style
hit car strumming a beat and a pumpin' and the lead man picking out the blues
hip-shaking singer was a swinging and a swinging saying some style blue suede shoes
and I was here when it happened, Lord I think I ought to know, yeah, yeah
Folks I was here when it happened I watched Memphis give birth to rock and roll
What you think about it little guitar c'mon son

Some folks called it the devils music others said it wouldn't last long
31 years since we started shakin' proves somebody was wrong
the 64's, the Beatles and the four were rock and roll's best friends
The Beatles and The Stones brought the old beat home
And world went crazy again I was here when it happened
My friend I think I ought to know, yeah , yeah
Well I was there when it happened
I watched Memphis give birth to rock and roll
Lord yeah, c'mon"

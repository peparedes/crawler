"event","i really didnt think that these critters existed, but boy was i wrong. i just thought it was an expression they say to scare the shit out of little kids before they go to sleep. but they came after me. the bed bugs. for 4 weeks now they have been in my room, near my bed area. they first time i noticed something was when i was waking up with bits all over my arms. my first though...hives. and so did my parents. so i was taking all my old allergy stuff, but it wasnt working. then one night at 3 in the morning, i turned on my light, and there it was. the bed bug in the flesh, on my sheets. i freaked. the second i saw that, i went on my laptop and went to google and typed in bed bug. and there was the picture. i searched my bed and killed more. my parents called the bug people, and for 4 weeks, every wednesday they have to come and spray the house. this isnt an easy proses either. all of my clothes are in the bottom of my bed, cause i have the captains bed set. so i have been living out of giant black garbage bags. every week i have to strip my sheets, and my matress must come out of my room. this goes for maureen and jack too. jack had some nests in his bed. maureen had one bug in her room.  well today is 9-15 and the treatments are all over with....well at 3 45 this morning, i found 11 in my bed. i almost shit my pants, i was killing them left and right. so i went to sleep on the couch. my mom found me there and asked why, and i told her bed bugs, and her and my dad ripped apart my bed room. we are getting rid of my wooden captains bed and my desk and everything. i dont have a bed set in my room as im typing this. its ripped apart into pieces sitting on my back porch. were tossin that bitch. we found dead ones on the floor under my bed when cleaning up. so i dont know how long i will have to sleep on the couch for, hopefully not for long. god i feel like when i was in ninth grade, when i had to sleep on the couch for 6 months cause the hurricane destroyed my room. =/ 

p.s.
dont let the bed bugs bit."

I plan on doing the IRCC thing for 2 years...nothing wrong with that. I dont plan on living at home though...Ive wanted to get out of her pretty much since middle school. Anywho....I hate my job so I need to find another one. Walgreens just sucks as now. They never schedule me anymore, Im just always on call. bitches.

"event","Well its time for the class of 2006 to leave us, im not going to lie...this was an amazing class. At band awards I got upset and and graduation i didnot shed a tear, but today i was driving home and it hit me, there leaving. My mom asked if i was ok and of course i said yes, but really i wasnot. Then I just started to cry my eyes out. I honestly dont know why it hit me out of the blue. My mom asked me if i was going to miss Mike and Allan the most and i said yes. I mean im pretty much going to miss all of them, but Mike and Allan i just got really close with them. We had some really good times together. And on top of them leaving, Allan is leaving the state. My mom said today that Mike and I had a ""Love Hate Relationship"" and i started to laugh. I remember the first time Mike called I honestly didnot think we would be this good of friends. This entry is prolly totally pointless to those of u if u happen to read this, but livejournal is for venting right?
I kno i keep mentioning my mom but she really was worried about me today cuz i looked so down. i was sitting on the computer playing solitare and she came over and was playing with my hair saying everything is going to be alright. She asked if i had any friends in class of 2007 and i said yea but im not as close with them as i was this year with 06.
It really sucks when one of ur good guy friends are leaving. I told Mike pretty much everything...and now hes leaving. And i know when we tried to hang out ...someone would always call wondering where he is. But i guess that was her job lol
But life goes on and theres nothing i can do. Hopefully they will keep in touch and come over and swim whenever they want.
I had some good times and honestly i will never forget them."

Today in 5th period i really didnot feel good, to the pint were i didnot even want to talk. so coach i is going over the bell work and he says, ""ok someone smart answer this question."" I am sitting there please dont call on my please dont say me name PLEASE! all of a sudden he looks up and me and says, ""Anne-Marie"" I knew the answer i just didnot want to answer it cuz i knew my voice would crack. so nobody is talking in the class and i start to talk and i said the answer and meghan worthington yells out ""Annie u sound like a man"" and the whole class starts laughing.  

then today in 6th period, my teacher gave me somethin then she walked away, so i called her name but my voice was not coming out of my mouth, i screaming as loud as i can and trying to clear my throat but still nothing. chris lyda was sitting by me playing solitare with me, looking at me like i was stupid, and then someone goes are u sick and i just nodded my head cuz my voice was just not working.

All in all i feel like shit and it sucks cuz normally i never get sick. im taking medicane but i feel like its not working fast enough.

Today had to be the crappiest day of my life. (I am just venting so dont take any of this stuff personal) I hate that rumors can spread so fast, its rediculous. it really pisses me off. im pretty sure this had to be the first rumor that was ever spread about me...and it really sucked. my teachers kno now everybody knows. (Im not repeating the rumor so if u dont kno ...tough luck)
It was hard on me and the other person...all day both of us got shit for doing something that everyone does. its not like it was a big deal. geez seriously. 
i walk into geometry today and everyone is looking at me like i committed a crime or something. so for the whole 45 min of class today...i was the topic of the day. seriously shut the fuck up and go do something interesting in ur life instead of talking about me! someone should have just asked dr jones if they could barrow the intercome to annouce it to the whole school!
in the end rumors can hurt people, they can make u cry and they can really destroy ur image as a person. rumors have to be the worst things, it may be true and it may not be...but someone always ends up getting hurt.
maybe people should realize before opening ur mouth u should think about gee am i going to hurt the person and just tell one more person what i just heard? u should find people that u trust so they wont tell the whole world.
sebastian is a small town so things get around pretty quickly....so just think before u descide to tell somebody!"

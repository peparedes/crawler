I have no idea what's going on with the schedule right now. Supposedly it's lunchtime, but no one's left for lunch.

I finished the first novella in the J.D. Salinger book I checked out. There's a quote from Catcher in the Rye that sums up my affinity for Mr. Salinger: 

""What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.""

So, computer class is three hours long today because the freshman are taking end-of-course tests today. I ought to do my trig homework, but I've got an hour and a half.

Yesterday I crashed the Anything Goes cast party. Really, Mr. Ipina didn't mind, but saying I crashed it makes me sound cooler. Free pizza and a bunch of my friends--it was fun. We were supposed to be watching the video of the performance, but no one paid attention to the TV except when their parts came up. 

I bought the new Georgia Nicolson book this weekend. I didn't even know it was out! I love the updated covers; they're adorable. I'm really sort of mad that it ended on a HUGE cliffhanger. I was all set for Georgia to get with Dave the Laugh, then it was the end of the book. How much does that suck? I also ordered one of my summer reading books. The book's titled, ""How to Read Anything Like a Professor."" I can't wait to get it. Mrs. Moser showed it to us earlier, and it sounds hilarious. One of the chapter titles was, ""Everything's About Sex--Except Sex."" The best part is, we don't have to write anything on it. Score. 

I suppose I should do my trig homework now. It's logarithms, which I only have a vague grasp on. 

Oh, last night I checked out Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction by J.D. Salinger from the library. I flipped through it, and my name is used. I haven't decided whether or not that's an awesome thing because I haven't read far enough to find the character and figure out whether she's an agreeable person or not.

EDIT: God, this is stupid. We were assigned even-numbered problems only, but I keep forgetting to skip the odd-numbered problems. I have no idea if I'm doing them right or not. I'm just writing down crazy stuff. I hate logarithms.

Now it's done. I've still got about 30 minutes in this class. 

I brought my camera to school today, but the batteries just died. Argh."

<center>The Great American Short Story

by Charlotte Fuqua and Catherine Dawson
and whoever else feels like they can add a sentence</center>

<font color=darkpink>It was a dark and stormy night. <font color=seagreen>The trees creaked and swayed like a drunken granny. <font color=blueviolet>Apparently the granny hadn't gotten any in a long itme because she reached out her branches to poke any man who walked by.<font color=darkpink> All of a sudden, there was a huge bolt of lightning and a resonating clap of thunder. The thunder and lightning weren't so important as what they illuminated. It was<font color=seagreen> a crouching body, cloaked in cloaky darkness. The form seemed to be tensing, then with a hiss it <font color=blueviolet>leapt forward out of the cloaky darkness to reveal a horrigic visage. It was as hideous as <font color=darkpink> a hideous person on hideous pills. It was hard to tell if it was a person, an animal, or even if it was of this world. Just a quick look at the creature revealed its dire nees for a bath adn its striking similarity to [Name Withheld]'s hair. Ye gods! It was Dylan's hair! <font color=seagreen>yet beneath this mind-numbingly horrific hair (obviously purloined from Dylan's rotting corpse in the next scene), the creature had a short of Shrek-like cuteness. <font color=blueviolet>The cute quality in this creature stemmed from its pathetic whimper. The sound it was making made you want to take it home and giveit a bowl of oatmeal.
<font color=darkpink>""Mah name ith Patwick. Ah'm fower,"" it squeaked. 
Upon closer inspection, I discovered the creature was a child, caked with dirt and hair and leaves. He looked as if he would be quite an adorable child once he was scrubbed with industrial strength exfoliating body wash. <font color=seagreen>Patrick liked to talk out loud, whether to himself or his invisible dragon male nanny, Antonio de Dragonescu. Patrick also liked his brother <font color=blueviolet> who will remain nameless for his own protection...but one thing can be said: at 6'1"", with black curly hair, electrifyingly green eyes, <font color=darkpink>and rock hard yet only slightly defined abs,<font color=blueviolet>he was a total babe. <font color=darkpink>
I eventually took Patrick home, cleaned him up, and gave him some actual clothes. As the weeks passed, we became fast friends. While Patrick talked about his brother a lot and even showed me a picture (that he kept tucked only God knows where), Patrick never mentioned his family or why he was wondering in the woods on that dark and stormy night. One day, in the middle of Patrick's daily Hooked on Phonics lesson, there was a knock. At the door. Had someone come to take away the only joy and companion of a previously misanthropic, reclusive seventeen-year-old? I though as I warily made my way towards the front door. I discovered that it was <font color=seagreen>the UPS guy. My packages had arrived, containing large amounts of fashionable if not insensible footwear. After going into ecstacies over my new <i>souliers</i> I looked up and noticed a strange sound emanating from my kitchen. <font color=blueviolet> Oh my god, I thought. It was Patrick's hot brother--stored in my freezer. He is cold... I must warm him iwth my body heat. 
<font color=darkpink>While ""body heat"" was my first impassioned, lustful thought to keeping him warm, logic and morals soon prevailed. I told Patrick to guide his borderline-hypothermic brother to the couch while I ran to the linen closet and feverishly sought my thickest blankets. <font color=seagreen>Sadly, the thickest blanket I possessed was my admittedly warm yet highly unmanly My Little Pony comforter. Finding nothign else, I heaved a sigh and thought, ""Why do I have to be so good? Oh God, I'm giving hte hot guy a bright pink quilt with cartoon ponies on them."" I carried the blanket under my arm and use my free hand to cover my eyes lest I be exposed to various naughty bits. Being unnaturally clumsy, I then <font color=blueviolet>tripped and conveniently let my hand uncover my eyes--to catch myself, of course. Me being clumsy, I did not catch myself. Instead, I caught a big handful of my handsome visitor's <font color=darkpink>thick, muscular forearm. 
""Wow. Thanks."" I found myself talking to his feet--I was suspended with my face three inches from them. 
With me still clutching his toned forearm, he brought himself (and me) to a standing position. (Thankfully, Patrick was holding a throw pillow up to cover any rogue gonads.) 
""You're welcome,"" he said. Oh, his voice! It was like<font color=seagreen> a symphony of cherubim and seraphim dancing in a puddle of sugar-spun wonder. Our position, though, was slightly more than awkward. The My Little Pony blanket somehow wrapped around my feet and I was clutching at a naked guy's arm whose decency was only kept in place by a four-year-old holding a pillow.

More later."

I just finished reading Catherine's Cosmo. It was the shirtless guy issue. Niiiiice. I learned lots of things that I will never use.  

I figured out how to get my mascara absolutely perfect. I have a very old tube of Clinique Long and Pretty Lashes, which has degenerated into more of a lash tint, and I have a tube of MAC Zoom Lash. The Clinique doesn't provide much volume or lengthening, but the brush is perfect and I've never seen a single clump. The MAC mascara lengthens nicely, but the brush's bristles are too thick, so they spread the mascara too haphazardly. Haphazard = Clumpy lashes. So, I dip the Clinique brush into the MAC tube, and voila, the perfect lash. 

This is so silly. I'm talking about makeup techniques on an online blog. People at my LiveJournal will appreciate this more. Double posted!"

Prom was actually okay, everybody. Caleb actually came in a tux, which made me incredibly RELIEVED. His mother is competent. A group of us reserved the room at Ruby Tuesday, and we had a lot of fun. Kierria spilled her Raspberry Lemonade on the table, and I pushed my chair away from the table (quite violently, I might add) just seconds before it dripped (more like gushed) over the side of the table. I managed to save myself! Hooray! Prom night fiasco averted. After dinner, we headed to the dance. The committee outdid themselves with the decorations! I was amazed. The dancing, though... argh, I don't like it too much. Caleb pretty much dropped me once, and was too busy laughing (he said he was too surprised) to help me off the floor. Someone managed to spike the punch, but I drank out of the water fountain, so I was fine. As we left, we even got little gift bags with a picture frame in them. The frame is modeled after a director's clapboard, and it says ""Hollywood Night, Valdosta High Prom 2006"". We left for Lauren's house, and Nikki's mother and her mother and my mother made some breakfast food. I looove Lauren's mother's grits. My own mother's grits are too thick and small-grained for my tastes (I eat them anyway because I love her). We stayed at Lauren's house until about 1:00, when I took Caleb home and swung by my house to grab my overnight bag and change out of my dress. Melissa and I stayed the night at Lauren's, then saw a movie the next day. 

Prom was pretty cool, but there was a certain je ne sais quoi that was missing. Otherwise, it was not the disaster I imagined it would be.

I tried to get tickets yesterday, but the teachers selling them were NOT in their classrooms. So, today, I go and I try to find them, but both teachers have substitutes because they are busy decorating Mathis Auditorium for the prom. Great. THIS IS NOT GOOD. I invited someone from another school, so I have full responsibility when it comes to ticket-getting. I'm going to have to ask one of my friends if they can go get two from the teachers... WAIT. Lindsey doesn't have a 7th period. Maybe she'll go get them for me. Please, please God. I can't believe I waited this long. I am such a procrastinator. 

Something I have a problem with: 
On the JV Soccer team* last year, everyone was nice, there were no little fights, and no one had a real problem with anyone else. Last night, I was sitting on the bench next to one of the managers, and a girl who had just come off the field from playing almost 20 minutes asked for some water. THe manager said under her breath, ""Don't give it to her!"" I asked her why she would say something like that, and she replied, ""I just don't like that girl."" Me: ""Why not?"" Her: ""I just don't like her."" Me: ""I completely do not get that. What is with this team? All these flipping freshman and their personal vendettas. I do not see why you have to hold a grudge against someone you've never really talked to and who's never really done anything to merit your little vendetta."" Her: ""God, what are you talking about? Vendetta? I have no idea what that means. <i>Whatever.</i>""  
This manager I'm talking about doesn't even do a good job. The team takes her on away games and pays for her meal on the road, yet she complains when she picks up the balls after practice and before games, if she doesn't outright <i>refuse</i> to do it. Yesterday, at the game, she refused to film the boys' game because she's scared of heights. I tried to strike a deal with her. She could take my spot as ball girl and I would film the game. It took her three people's explanations and ten minutes to grasp what I was offering. She is incredibly immature, and I'm having a hard time putting up with her.

In happier news, last night was my friend Holly's first time as goalie. She was freaking out really bad because she thought she would be absolutely horrible, and there was so much pressure on her. She started crying a bit in the locker room, and all of us defensive people (that was bad grammar) hugged her and promised to keep that ball as far away from the goal as we could. Holly became even more nervous when Coach told her that the varsity girl who was going to play goalie for one half couldn't because her mother wouldn't let her. It was all Holly, all of the game. In the end, Holly gave us a shutout! 3-0! It was awesome. She made some amazing saves, and if she had been practicing goalie and playing that position in games since the start of the season, she would be a really, really good goalie. I love you, Holly! Go Holly!

*I feel like I'm wasting my time. I'm a junior and I don't even start on JV. How sad is that? I am horrible at soccer and I get really depressed and anxious before games and during the first half despite the fact that I play a good bit in the second half. Also, I learned yesterday that I suck at every single position. I tried to play goalie while varsity was making shots on the goal, and I didn't catch a single one. I play perfectly fine when it's a casual thing and no one's really paying attention, but I sort of choke up and forget everything during games or important practices. Like, when I was helping Holly prepare before the game, I made some heartbreakingly beautiful shots to the upper corners of the goal. No (amateur) goalie could ever have caught them. Yet, when I'm in the game, I can't seem to take the ball from someone who looks like a strong wind would push them over."

Maybe Coach'll let me onto Junior Varsity. I just hope we have better uniforms this year... The numbers were falling off of our old away jerseys and all of the home jerseys were extra large. 

I signed up for one of those communities where you have to make 50 or 100 icons in a certain amount of time. I'm doing 50 icons about the Triwizard Tournament in 5 weeks. So, if anyone has any screencaps for me, tell me. I'm going to need all I can get. I made an icon yesterday, and it looks pretty cool. There weren't many effects on the lighting of the picture, but I found a good brush on CorelPhotopaint and I used a good font. I think it looks pretty good for someone my speed."

"event","Hello. Another update. In computer class today! 

Yesterday, when I was getting in the car to go to youth church (very fun stuff), I dropped my phone on the concrete floor of the garage. I picked it up; it looked fine. It wasn't even very scratched, yet when I turned it on, 

<b>ONLY HALF THE SCREEN SHOWED.</b>

I was so sad. My poor little phone. I've had it over a year and nothing's really happened to it, but maybe it's time for a new one. Like my friend said when I told him, maybe this is telling me to get a new flip phone. (I was talking to him just the other day about how I want a shiny, new, cool, flippy phone instead of the phone I have.)

I haven't told my dad yet, and my mother wasn't too mad about it. She didn't yell, which was good. Her hyperthyroidism is back and she has to undergo the radioactive iodine treatment on Friday. We can't get near her for a few days after that, but she'll feel perfectly fine. I appreciate the effort she is making in not yelling at us. 

So, my phone still makes calls and does text messages, but I have to do a lot of things from memory, like typing texts and making calls. I can't read texts. My mother said she'll go to the Alltel store and ask if they can fix it. Personally, I have mixed feelings about that. I REALLY want a new phone, but there are a lot of numbers in there that I don't have stored anywhere else. It would take a lot of effort and looking stupid and contacting people I haven't talked to in a long time to get those numbers back. 

My poor phone. I never came up with a good name for it, but I do remember the day I got it. It was November 5, 2004, a Friday. I was getting ready to leave for the football game. My dad kept messing with a box from Nokia, and I supposed he had bought himself a new phone. Imagine my surprise when my father tells me to answer the home phone, and when I pick up, he says to me, ""Come get your new cell phone, Charlotte!"" I forgot to breathe and started crying (just a little) because I was ecstatic! I had made lists of people with cell phones, looked up plans on the internet, and even compared networks to persuade my parents to buy me a cell phone. Just the week before, I had resigned myself to buying my own phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. But there I was, with my own new cell phone with a color screen, and I did not have to pay for any of it. 

I felt as if my high school social life had truly begun.

#2 is sorta crappy, sorry. I have a different version of #4 that I will post later, and I made the doll on #6 with the Hogwarts candybar dollmaker. I will post a link later because they deserve credit and it's the funnest dollmaker ever. I promise."

"event","Okay, quick update because the bell is probably about to ring. I'm about to go to Advisement, which is pointless for people like me who actually pass all their classes. I have Mr. Robinson, the band director, who is a nice man, but we meet in the auditorium, so it's extra boring. It's not like I have anyone interesting in there besides Rachel and Morgan and Megan (they're boy-and-girl twins. they love my ghetto impressions. Like, during the last chemistry lab, I started singing ""I'm in Love with a Stripper"" because that song was stuck in my head** and Morgan nearly died trying to hide his laughter). 

**I had that song stuck in my head because every time I get in the car with Lindsey she plays it. It's too catchy for it's own good, and what's worse is I don't even like that song. 

P.S. I really like the forums on MuggleCast's fanlisting. Everyone's nice to each other and no one gets called out for spamming when really they were trying to help someone *COUGHLEAKYLOUNGECOUGH*. Plus also my favorite MuggleCaster gets on and answers questions a lot. Eric Scull forever!"

"event","Well, I am doing fine. I hope this journal won't be as boring as the last. I really, really love my layout. It took a while and a lot of tweaking, but it's good.

I've been talking to one of my friends from the Y-Club youth assembly a lot lately. It's a brand-new experience talking to someone who I'm pretty sure is smarter than me. 

ARGH BELL.

Okay, back. After school. I'm listening to MuggleCast and writing an email at the same time. It's confusing me.

Done with the email. Bored. More. Later. Maybe."

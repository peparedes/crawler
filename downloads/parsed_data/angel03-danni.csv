How many times have you told me you love her
As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you
I live through you
You looked through me

Ooh, Solitude,
Still with me is only you
Ooh, Solitude,
I can't stay away from you

How many times have I done this to myself
How long will it take before I see
When will this hole in my heart be mended
Who now is left alone but me

Ooh, Solitude,
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, Solitude,
Only you, only true

Everyone leaves me stranded
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind
I can't stay here another night

Your secret admirer
Who could it be

Ooh, Can't you see
All along it was me
How can you be so blind
As to see right through me

And Ooh, Solitude,
Still with me is only you
Ooh, Solitude,
I can't stay away from you

 The River""

You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores...and

I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide...yes

I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all...yes

I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry


We call them cool 
Those hearts that have no scars to show 
The ones that never do let go 
And risk the tables being turned 

We call them fools 
Who have to dance within the flame 
Who chance the sorrow and the shame 
That always comes with getting burned 

But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire 

We call them strong 
Those who can face this world alone 
Who seem to get by on their own 
Those who will never take the fall 

We call them weak 
Who are unable to resist 
The slightest chance love might exist 
And for that forsake it all 

They're so hell-bent on giving ,walking a wire 
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 
Standing outside the fire 
Life is not tried, it is merely survived 
If you're standing outside the fire 

There's this love that is burning 
Deep in my soul 
Constantly yearning to get out of control 
Wanting to fly higher and higher 
I can't abide 
Standing outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 
Standing outside the fire 
Life is not tried, it is merely survived 
If you're standing outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 
Standing outside the fire 
Life is not tried, it is merely survived 
If you're standing outside the fire



""Unanswered Prayers""

Just the other night at a hometown football game 
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame 
And as I introduced them the past came back to me 
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be 

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times 
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine 
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then 
I'd never ask for anything again 

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers 
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs 
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care 
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers 

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams 
And I could tell that time had changed me 
In her eyes too it seemed 
We tried to talk about the old days 
There wasn't much we could recall 
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all 

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife 
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord 
For the gifts in my life 

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers 
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs 
That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care 
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers 

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... 
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers"

I look out the window as the flakes fall so peacefully and I can't help but feel this innocence as if i was a child again. But I feel so cold and lonely as well and wish you were here to act as my warmth. My heart beats with hoilday cheer already... i just wish on every snowflake i could share it with you. I wonder what my baby bros are doning right now. They'd be oh so excited. I miss them so and i'm missing so many traditions... i get to spend hoildays with them but it ain't the same. Sad. But maybe this winter will be the kinda winter wonderland i wish for with my very own jack frost."

I'm a failure
I'm to blame
I'm just like her
I take but don't give back
How can I love you?
I'm a waste of your time
My dad said all this as he drinks like there's no end 
I cry i'm so hurt 
Where's my dad? I miss him
Just push me away
Break my heart
She did my mom that is
But still i find myself wishing she was here
I miss her too would she hold me
and tell me everything's ok
or would she even care
Broken promises lies shadows
Tearing us apart
Look at what my life has become
Cry. 
No one wants me
No one cares
I love you so much and tell all to you
I would give you the world but you don't see
Mind you you're a great friend 
But can't you hold me and love me back 
No of course not i'm different right
Damn me. 
I love you would be nice. 
Right now i envy the ones
who hear in everyday 
the ones who have someone
to hold them 
to turn to
to offer a shoulder
Cry on... who? 

 i cry here
oh so lonely
this isn't me
help 
My friends all feel so far away
where are they when needed

Cry... i'm a complete mess i hate it"

"event","Last night I went to the coffee house at Kenner. it was a total blast and everything looked amazing... thanks to my girl shannon the atmosphere was so very mellow and cheery. Ya so I got there kinda early like by an hour but my dad had to leave for work so i took the first chance i got for a ride... i wouldn't miss it for the world. so ya i was excepting glen to meet me out front like he said he would after all i was truly there cause i was invited by him but he didn't show... no biggy i found my way and shannon was there to greet me with the best hug ever... it was greatly needed... shannon girl i love you. then I believe that russell was the next to greet me... so very nice. I felt so special cause i got to watch all the preshow stuff... i couldn't stop laughing at glen who was being hes foolish self. ya but then sarakins and amber showed and i was so surprised to see them... sarakins and i did some catching up... she was oh so nervous about her comedy act but i told her to do it for moi and she did it was fuckin funny. everyones performances were wonderfully done but i was completely blown away once again by messacar... he rocks my world what can i say i'm his number 1 fan. he played my two favs like he promised.. sad song and fade away. his cover was ten thousand times better and he looked sexier then noel ever will. anyway i think anyone could see i was a devoted fan. i thank him for awknowledging it too he said that it was worth clapping for cause i left them all last year but was still devoted to kenner... then on impluse i yelled out ya kenner rocks mother fuckers... it was awesome. ya i never  realized how much of an oasis fan i was but it was played about 8 or more times last night and i sang along to every one... no shit except for shannon's cover of wonderwall because i was wowed... it was beauiful and so moving that i cried... but i cheered for her after it was done... followed by a huge i love  you shannon. I was also very glad that kate solomon got up to perform with erin... she said she wasn't going to i was like hell ya you are and she did it for me in cowboy hat and all. i got to wear that hat later on in the night... man i love pb... the poor kid left her jacket on my chair and i went home with it... i freaked her... sorry kate the coat still sits nicely on my couch... she shall come get it soon she said lol every one rocked and i love them all so very much... i mean they don't have to include me but they do.... thanks my friends for a blast last night. i'll always be a devoted fan to all of you... but messacar is my number 1 lol"

My iron level rasies and falls... i'm fed up.. things are messed... my friends or some of them are pushing me away... my dad and his drunkin hate... i'm so damn lonely... living in the shadows longing for some one to say i love you. sorry i'm just not me... dunno why... but i do know i hate this... i want to be me again. but i'm not very strong right now just useless. I fuckin hate waking up every day... wandering what crap is in store for me. i'm an emotional wreck .... one day gloomy as hell the next ok but i haven't be totally happy in a while. i feel like all my smiles are fake and i'm putting on a show. the question maybe has arose alot... like maybe no pain today or maybe you'll say you care today. but i'm sick of maybe so uncertian... i feel like running for it all... i feel like i'm letting everyone down but do they care. right now when i need support i'm not getting it. i mean they all say they care but words aren't everything. help... i'm messed... no i don't want this for myself. where's the old me?"

He staggered in drunk again last night... he won't tell me what's wrong he just fuckin drinks it away. Last night he call me a failure and said he was depressed since my birth and all this resentful shit. I mean I know it was just the booze talking when is it fuckin not these days but he again made me feel so small and unwanted... i cried myself to sleep. I asked him what was wrong why he was hurting himself like this... he said his problem was me and he wishes for me to disappear. I yelled at him for the first time ever telling him i hated him for this shit... every fuckin night i'd gladly move back to Mom's but for what to be shit on again.... oh ya i didn't know this but apparently i'm the reason why my mom now suffers of depression and i will be just like her... a shelfish bitch. Whatever fuck you asshole! I just don't understand I mean he wants my brother to quit but he turns around and does it himself.... oh ya that will work now won't it fucker..duh! I'm regreting coming to live here but i had no fucking choice... no one to turn to.... its the same now... i can't get out of this hell hole. ty says he doesn't mean this and i need to talk to him but when can i hes never sober anymore...  it hurts inside. And the thing is he'll laugh it off l ike nothing happended no i'm sorry... or i love you. I used to do the same but why should i have to so i can deal with the same shit again tommorrow.. what good is that. Wheatever... i make myself sick  thinkin about him now... asshole how could he say that to me i'm so angry but everything is a joke to him. OMG i think i understand why my mom left him... fuck wish i could... man my family is fucked up... what's it like comin from a stable family as i cry ... i ask myself that. fuck i'm so sad... this whole thing makes my stomach turn.... fuck... go away... i keep wishing but it doesn't fuckin help. man i'm sick of this shit... my own father makes me sick... thats fuckin maddening!"

"event","Well this was my first thanksgiving weekend at my father's ever... it was different but good. My dad had the weekend off work which was nice.... very awesome! and although the weekend didn't go quite as planned... we had each other. I mean Kat was suppose to come down but she stayed home for the Norwood Fair. On friday night Dad and I went out drinking at the Vibe... it was a blast and I got real drunk... we came home at two am and blasted the tunes and paried it up but come saturday I was very tired... so sat was kinda boring... I just chilled with andrew and tyler. Ty kept leaving us two alone as if to say he wanted sparks to fly between us... well pff there ain't no fire burning anymore. But Andrew is trying still he got my a necklace was a gift to say he was thankful to have our friendship. He stayed for our 1st turkey dinner... which was quite yummy i might add. Yesterday was my Mommy's 41st birthday... happy b day mom... we were suppose to have some mother daughter time today.... chapters then a movie and dinner but i phoned her yesterday and she was feeling sick on her b day man that bites. so i think we're hanging next weekend. Tonight is our second turkey dinner Gramma is coming down to play some bingo and yahtzee ( lets hope I won baby), singin with my dad and crazy uncles is always fun (no bob dylan please i beg you) and oh i get to see my baby 2nd cuz gracie for the first time. I LOVE BABIES... AND GRAMMA'S PIES LOL. all is good and although i do miss thanksgivin at moms.... i'm happy and thankful for this time i have spent with friends and family!

Happy Thanksgiving,

"event","I'm so tired this morning... I couldn't sleep last night.... Last night really sucked. Oh ok so ya I found that my friend Carl with MD is in the hospital. His immune system is low and he has lung problems because he has MD he won't be able to fight it off much longer. I'm so upset... like Jamie his seventeen year old bro just died a month and a half ago. I know these kids from camp... we were close friends and Carl goes to Kenner as well. Oh my god when Jamie died I lost myself... I can't lose Carl too. Why God why are you doing this... I am so worried for Carl... it kills me inside to know that I can't help him get better. I cried myself to sleep after praying for Carl. I couldn't sleep... I woke up a billion times.... crying. OH and did I mention my bro is really stupid at 8 at night he told me him and a friend were going to jump off the back of a moving train... I said what the fuck you'll kill yourself but he didn't listen .... so in the middle of the night I woke up cause I got this chill down my spine like someone had walked over my grave... i just knew something was wrong. Just then at two am Kennedy's father knoked at the door... nervous as hell... wondering where his son was. My dad told me that Tyler wasn't home yet ethier. They went out looking for them while I laid it bed thinking the worse... shaken and crying. I mean Tyler means the world to me if anything happens to him i'd... I never realized how much I care about him until a point where he wasn't safe. Man, I was freaked I needed someone there to hold me and tell me everything was going to be fine... I thought of my mom and then of Jim and then of Andrew and then of Glen... I just wanted to feel secure. It was long before my dad came back saying he couldn't find Tyler.... I screamed and cried and cried. At 5 am my bro came walking in... I was like oh thank god you're ok I was  worried sick don't do a stupid thing like that again. He came over to my bed... saw a tear in my eye and hugged me and said its ok I'm fine... he held me a while and I felt secure... man i love my lil bro... so I said it and he said Love ya and don't worry I'll never leave.. that was the nicest thing he's ever said to me. I think he saw how strong our love really is and as he tucked me in that night I knew my bro was always there for me. What a feeling... but in general i was so relieved that one of the worse nights of my life was over.

Sleepy,
Danni"

NO! god damnit and it makes me sick inside... i'm unhappy i feel it in the pit of my stomach. I mean why can't someone say they love me.... not even my own fuckin dad will... i say i love you to him which i might add i'm scared to say and he didn't return the feeling.... man why i don't understand.... i'm not that unloveable am I? what am I doing wrong? I mean i feel like everyone is using me and ignoring me. Do they not understand I miss them? I JUST WANNA CRAWL UP IN A BALL AND TELL THE WORLD TO FUCK OFF!!!!

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>It's been a while since I last wrote... what's been happening... ALOT!!!! Where to start.... Well, things are good at work...Very good!!! I have really been getting along with my co worker Ian. What can I say about Ian? He's 21, funny as hell, very ambitious and so much more. OK he's sexy... i mean come on james van der beek look alike... and get this his last name is Dawson LMAO! I really enjoy working with him.... sometimes he can be quite a distraction tho (hottness). Great friends we have became and we have great convos at work... usually i'm shy around guys but not him.... maybe its because he has a form of cerebral pasly as well(although not in a chair) i still feel that some how he knows what i'm going through. I finally asked if he was single .... he said yes...OMG! that sexy thing single so then he asked if I was and Andrew came to my mind... it took alot but I was like yup and proud of it. Then he asked if I looking to be in a realationship... i felt so stupid when I said ummmmm i don't know but then he broke the ice and said i'm just waiting for the right person. Every since then he has been flirting with me like crazy... i'm a hottie lol. He sends me emails at work and i send them back we are so naughty...the boss might catch us. But the things he says are so sweet and I don't have a problem flirting back of course not. I try to stay on task but my eyes are continously drawn to him as he continues to comment on my eyes himself followed by sexy or babe. On thursday, he asked for my number... omg I never had a guy want me so bad.... i mean i was always the one chasing the guys. Thrusday at work was great!!! he asked me out to dinner on friday. IAN: danni you know what I would love? Me: What's that? Ian: to have your beautiful eyes stare into mine from a cross the dinner table on friday night.... so how about it? Me: Is this you asking me out on a date? Ian: that it is (shyly) Me: well, i don't know... Ian: oh quit playing hard to get you know you want to... you in for quite a treat babe... i'll treat you like a queen Me: well in that case I can't resist...yes. Ian: oh come on babe you know thats not all you can't resist(winks) Me: whispers: ok your so damn sexy.... now get to work. On Friday at work we couldn't stop thinkin about later that night. I mean ian was sending his regular flirtous emails: i can't wait to see you tonight hun. When I came home from work he was all that was on my mind until andrew phoned and asked me to the movies... i didn't quite understand why cause ever since we kissed he is ignoring but anyway i basically told him that i was moving on and he should to. then came the intracation.... moving on? with who? don't you love me? I addmit a part of me still loves him and wants but i need to move on. Thanks to my friend Kayt for helping me to see that. I love ya Gurl... he'll never hurt me again cause when i hung up the phone that night... i felt free. that chapter of my life ended. 6 30 came pretty quick and I met IAN at the Pizza Factory my fav I might add. He was lookin sexy as hell.... oh man! and such a gentleman he held the door. thats big for me. We had good convo about everything under sun. MIGHT I ADD HE GAVE ME A single ROSE!!!!! so romantic.... sigh.... so ya it was a beautiful night but hey no kiss. Meh.... i'd rather his hand anyway.... take it slow.... leave something up to the imagination... and believe me its on my mind.... sigh LOL! i can't wait till our next DATE. then my sis kat came for the weekend. what a blast! we had a chocolate bar hand jobbing.... oh henrys rock.... funny as hell weekend. I love Kat Yesterday we saw without a paddle. it was fuckin funny and omg dax and matt willard soooooooooooooo hot man. I want a dax and matt sandwitch lol. Ok, my sis was a bit annoying though she kept on commenting about glen calling me a glen lover but hey shes my sis thats her job right? She was really upset we didn't go shopping she made a comment about seeing shannon and russell again at mall... i don't know she scares me sometimes don't ask lol. But she seems to like shannon and russell or all my friends for that matter which is cool cause i love them too. but it was nice to see her again man i missed her. the whole weekend/last few days have been awesome. thanks for the rocking times kat and ian.... many more to come... i hope Wow what a weekend!, Danni</FONT></P>"

"event","I'm back.... then my dad came home piss ass drunk and high at 2 am and was saying how he regreted me moving here... that i was too much work. I feel like a damn obligation to him. But, on the other hand I know its the booze talking but it fuckin bothers me when he washin his problems away with booze. I told him that the other day and he swore he would quit... but then that night... same old shit. Man, it hurts me inside to hear him say that he doesn't want me here  and it also destroys me to know that my dad is influencing Tyler, my seventeen year old bro to drink and smoke drugs. It effecting Ty to because he takes advil 4 times a day due to headaches and he can't sing anymore. My bro was a lead singer in a band but had to quit because of numberous sore throats due to pot smoking. It hurts to see my brother throw away his dream like that. I just wish my dad couldn't find happiness and stop all this shit... it fucked up. I mean I know he's depressed cause Barb his girlfriend left and my mom is always bitching at him saying he not a good enough father... but hey i love him and hate to see him like this. He needs help... him and Tyler both but I can't give it to them. IT PISSES ME OFF!!! Fuck, so instead I have to listen to them put me down... won't someone consider my feelings for once. That night I cried to sleep because of all this shit and because I couldn't get Glen off my mind. Man, I love him it hurts so much that I can't have something I want so bad. DOES ANY1 FUCKIN WANT ME... LIKE WHAT THE FUCK? So then I woke up this morning excited as hell cause today was going to be my first day at Fleming but they called and said they weren't ready in terms of my personal care needs. WELL, I'd like to know what the fuck they were doing since last fall. They knew then that I was coming... they had lots of time to get off theier lazy asses and set care up BUT NO!!! God dammit, they stuck me on the side line due to my special needs... too much work again...I guess... well fuck them do they not know how hard it was for me to apply. They are remind me of my teachers at Norwood... everything was a fight with them. I AM SICK OF FIGHTING FOR EVERYTHING I WANT AND NEED!!!!! I just want to break down and cry. So ya, anyway, they told me that I'm starting in January. Well, what in the hell I'm a suppose to do until then HUH YOU FUCKIN BASTARDS. Then for the rest of the day...I couldn't stop thinking of Glen. Everything reminds me of him. I playing the song Sad Song by Oasis and started to cry. I  imagined him singing it with that sexy voice of his.. i know its one of our favs and then I was torn apart. Man, i don't know if I'll forget him in a crush kinda way ever. OH, my ex Matt wants me back too.. i see what happens once Glen is off my mind. But should I take hom back... he cheated on my ass?? I'm so confused and scared to love again. Fuck i'm pissing myself off!! Alot of my friends are trying to get me to stay positive right now... but I can't find away. Man, they are good friends but I don't really want to talk to them right now. I feel bad cause they are my friends and all. Theres one person I would love to talk to... he always knows the right things to say to make me feel better...GLEN!! but I can't bring myself to talk to him. I don't know why!! I guess I'm scared that if I talk to him right now, he'll never ecaspe my mind. I have to forget these feelings... damn it I HAVE TO!! But is this right to push him away and ignore him like this. Will it I affect our friendship forever??? I pray to god not. I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE....THINGS ARE MESSED UP!!!! Won't someone help me get my life back in order and some what normal...??? 

Tear shedding,

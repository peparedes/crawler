<center>song dedicated to josh : pretty baby - vanessa carlton</center>
pretty baby

you light me up and then I fall for you
you lay me down and then I call for you
stumbling on reasons that are far and few
I'd let it all come down and then some for you

pretty baby don't you leave me
I have been saving smiles for you
pretty baby why can't you see
you're the one that I belong to
I'm be the embrace that keeps you warm
for you're the sun that breaks the storm
I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound
as long as you keep comin' round, oh pretty baby

and I know things can't last forever
but there are lessons that you'll never learn
oh just the scent of you it makes me hurt
so how's it you that makes me better

chorus

why can't you hold me and never let go
when you touch me it is me that you own
pretty baby of the place that you hold in my heart
would you break it apart again ... oh pretty baby"

"event","you read it right.  this is going to be my last post on live journal.

haha, who would've thought, huh?  it took me a week to decide whether or not to go through with it, but then i thought it's high time that this phase of my life found its finish.  lj has served me well for the past two-and- a-half years, and after browsing through all my entries, and i guess i learned a few things along the way:


<font color=""#800080""><font size=""-2"">* traveling gives you new points of view -- literally and figuratively.

* everything happens for a reason.

* life answers all the questions you throw at it -- in one way or another.

* it always pays to have faith.

* when you think the world has abandoned you, somebody suddenly pops out of the woodwork and proves you wrong.

* the world is so beautiful to see that it would such a pity to be blinded by sadness and cynicism.

* experience is the best teacher, and sometimes, mistakes are the best lessons.

* there are always two sides on a coin, a silver linning behind every cloud, and a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow.

* you can always choose to be happy.

* wearing high heels is empowering. (now where did that come from?)

* you're different from the person you are yesterday; there is always the chance to change.

* when things get rough, it's not about having the strength to move on -- it's about having the will to try.</font> <font size=""-2""></font>
</font>

 it's nice to think that though i've been through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, it's all been good.  life's been good.  and i am thankful for that and for all the people who made it possible.  

(okay, i am trying very hard not to be dramatic about this.)

so, where will charlene be after this?  oh, this journal will still have a week or so before it final closes down.  i've got to save a lot of things, after all.  when that's done, i might still be on the net, somewhere else. ^_^  as you probably know, it's kinda hard for me to stay put in one place for a very long time, but i'll be around. ^_^

well...

well.

 i guess that's it.  the end of my set.  the last chord of the last song.

now let me take my bow.

anyway, thanks to those who greeted me on my birthday. ^_^  spent it quietly, and i realized that hey, quiet is pretty cool. i got lots of hugs too, but the best part was the last text i got that day -- <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~lala0range"" target=""_blank"">als</a>, thanks so much!  you made me so very happy. ^_^

my birthday resolution?

oh i don't know.  i'll just keep on riding this roller-coaster of a life i guess.  not knowing what's gonna happen next is lotsa fun.

and guess what?

i got that good vibe again.  you know that feeling when you can sense that something good's gonna happen?  i'm getting that feeling as of late.  last time i had that was before wendi's wedding.  i dunno.  i guess things are looking up.

"event","...still, you wonder what all of this means, where all of this ends.  sometimes, you feel it creeping from behind, and then you just stop walking.  you stand right in the middle of the sidewalk and look up.  

<i>where the hell am i?</i> 

you hate pauses -- they make you think.  so you quickly pick up the pace again lest you start wondering even more.  you don't exactly have any problems, but somehow, you feel tired and disoriented, like something invisible is wearing you out.  whatever it is, you constantly try to shake it off, and though at times you succeed, it always comes back with a vengeance.

<i>why am i here?</i>

the only thing you know is that you are perpetually teetering on the edge of <i>something</i>.  though you live for today, you always hold your breath for what is yet to come.  at times, you drink a bottle or two of something remotely alcoholic just enough to soften the world's edges that you constantly see.  it works, but you know it's only until the effect wears out.  

<i>what am i looking for?</i> 

no, you aren't really lonely -- you're just not so happy.  you don't know why but you feel that something is missing.  you can't describe what it is, but you've recognized it during the times when you lie between sleep and waking.  it's something that has always eluded you, and after a pretty long time, you're understandably tired of being eluded.  

<i>what?</i>

then again maybe you're just thinking too much.  you shrug and laugh the whole thing off.  oh yes, you need a vacation.  you miss the beach.  the last time you were on the beach was the year's happiest week for you.  you miss the feel of the sea breeze.  spreading your arms and feeling it thread through you -- that was the closest thing you could get to flying."

it's CFAD week in UST and my sister is part of a parade. ^_^  this year's theme revolves around dreams and fantasies. so cheryl's block decided to go macabre and went on giving edgar allan poe's lenor her dream wedding.  guess who played lenor? ;p

<div align=""center""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/lwddng1.jpg""></div>

they were SO adorable i kept on asking them to pose for me!  i wanted to pull them to the main building but since they were still parading, i really couldn't. so i just blurred the background since i didn't like it all that much.

cheryl more or less did her dress.  apparently she was sewing 'til the wee hours of the morning.  i just hafta hand it to her -- it came out pretty well.

here's the entourage!

<div align=""center""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/lwddng2.jpg""></div>

CUTENESS~!  i honestly wanted to put them in my pocket and take them home. ^_^

of course, i also had me a little bit of fun.  i LOVED the biomen~!

I was going through my picture files thinking that I should have everything printed soon when I came across this:

<div align=""center""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/aladespelunch.jpg"" border=""0""></div>

This was taken during Ala's <i>despedida</i> early this year.  Yup -- the <i>lunchmates</i> haha!  Though the shot's missing a few people, it still made me stare for a pretty long time until I got hit by one of those <i>senti</i> moments.  I practically grew up with this people!  <p><img align=right hspace=5 vspace=2 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/pammimi.jpg"">I remember Art Club sessions with Pam in '96. I remember Elea asking me to draw her a Sailormoon poster back in '94.  I remember asking that Superlemon candy from Ala more than a decade ago.  

I miss these people a HELL lot.    I saw Pam recently; I think that was shortly after the week I got sick (yup, I still had the mask on).  We had lunch in <i>Chocolate Kiss</i> and then we waited for a wedding in the <i>Bahay ng Alumni</i>, all the while taking pictures.  As for Elea, last I heard she was having weekday gigs in Makati.  (I really ought to drop by and watch her; I bet she's really good...)  Ala's in Australia, and every time I pass by Loyola Heights I miss that secure feeling of knowing that she would always be there in that old, warm house along B. Gonzales street.

And yeah, thinking about all that made me cry a little. :p

It's been a full and hectic past few months!  I was sick for the most part of August, and I spent the first three weeks of September recuperating.  I still get coughing spells and sometimes breathing can be a bit of a chore, but I got medicine for that, and those instances are becoming rare. ^_^  And good thing they are, since October spells San Miguel Octoberfest and that means lotsa-lotsa party!  

<p><img align=left hspace=10 vspace=5 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/alethsmargaritaeffect.jpg""> The opening was supposed to be held last Sept. 29 in the Megastrip, but it didn't push through because of the typhoon and the power outage.  They moved it to Oct. 4, which was last Wednesday, and after doing overtime 'til 8, my officemate Sara and I decided to check it out.  April called me up earlier on and we decided to meet up.

All in all there were six of us -- April was with her friends.  There were too many people though, so we ended up in having a few beers in Shang.  It turned out to be a good idea since it rained pretty hard later that evening.

<p><img align=right hspace=12 vspace=5 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/palasand.jpg"">Actually, if it weren't for these impromptu after-work gimmicks, I would've hit my head on a wall a long time ago.  It's almost the end of the year and after the lull months of the second quarter we're running after seasons in the office; the day the storm came and they suspended work I was at home doing 1,000 handmade Christmas tags.  It wasn't that hard, but it was really time-consuming.  And then there was planning to do for all the cards for next year's seasons -- I spent most of the past month's Saturdays in the office.  Well at least, overtime means extra income, hehe.

ButbutBUT, it isn't all that sad.  After all, there's Wendi's WEDDING to attend!  I'm already having the gown made based on the color and design scheme of the other sponsors -- it's this pink two-piece thing with an obi of deep coppery brown and organza.  I'm SO excited, but at the same time freaked out.  I've been helping the bride out with the arrangements, and wak, I'm gonna be playing during the reception!  With a singer!  And a pianist!  And a saxophone player!  I've never done that before!  I was in UP the whole day today practicing with my teacher.  Ignorant little me never realized how entirely different classical guitar was from jazz.  The wedding is in two weeks by the way.  Yikes.  Pray for me.

- The wedding.  The wedding the wedding the wedding!  More than playing during the reception, I have this feeling that something else, something <i>good</i> is gonna happen. ^_^

- Come end of October, I'll hopefully be out of town again.  GAD I hope it pushes through!  I SO need a vacation.

- My relatives are coming home for Christmas!  

- I'll be getting myself a bike before December ends.  Yup.  That I will.

- Next year, if all goes well, I'll be heading to the States. 

- And tomorrow... well, tomorrow's a new day.  That's enough to make me look forward to it. :p"

"event","I remember warm afternoons with my grandfather.  I would stay with him in his room and watch him type thousands and thousands of legal documents.  He was a lawyer, and a good one at that.  He once threw a law book at a judge and got suspended from court.

I remember the scent of those days with him; it was the smell of wood and paper, mixed with crisp collared shirts and old tennis balls.  He used to make little songs for me -- my favorite was ""Bubbles"" -- and we would both sing and sing while I blew bubbles from my little <i>Zesto</i> straw, until the sun set and we got slightly hoarse.

I've had good memories with him.  

His passing was my first experience of death.  I was in grade school then, a little kid watching herself in the mirror.  When I suddenly heard my grandmother's cry from my grandfather's room I saw my eyes widen -- I knew what it meant and yet I couldn't bring myself to scream.   

The days that followed melted into one another.  I felt as if I was floating somewhere between sleep and waking.  Nothing made sense.  It was painful, and I didn't know how to handle pain.  When he died, he left a certain void in me that hasn't really been filled in.      

And then, years later as we were cleaning the house, my mom handed me a piece of paper.

""I think this is for you.""




<div align=""center""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/family/daddysletter.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></div>



All of a sudden I felt all those well-missed afternoons crash into me with such intensity that I lost my breath.  I could almost see sunbeams dancing on the wooden floor panels, smell the old books and the and old tennis balls scattered about, hear the <i>clickity-clack</i> of the bulky typewriter and the sound of an old, old voice singing to me about bubbles, and breezes, and beauty.

I think I cried then.

I never asked about his inheritance.  I never really cared for it.  This yellowed sheet of paper is all that matters.  This is his legacy to me.  So are all those bright afternoons with him so very long ago that I'll always, always remember.

<font size=""-2""><i>He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme, I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
If I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right, it just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

His magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight, hold on tight

Oh 'cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on 
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy, hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Waiting so long
So long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the end, he breaks
He's never enough 
And still he's more than I can take 

Oh 'cause I don't know
Don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster

Oh oh...beautiful
Oh oh...beautiful disaster</i></font> 


i think at some point, every girl has met her beautiful disaster."

My dad took us with him to his department outing in a resort in Laguna.  Actually, there wasn't really much to see, except for the beautiful misty slopes of Mt. Makiling.  While my dad played poker with his officemates (he looked funny, actually -- <i>parang laging lugi</i>), Cheryl and I soaked in the pool before hopping in the jacuzzi.  Then we spent the whole day sleeping.

But the sea breeze was great and the sun was high and warm and it felt really good just to lie back on the sand underneath a coconut tree. ^_^

After balking at the P4,000+ price tag of a ""dolphin encounter"" in Sea World, we wandered aimlessly looking for a place to eat until we ended up at Padi's Point.  It was quite a dinner experience, what with watching a geriatric American dancing with a Filipina who obviously had an after-hours kind of profession.  It was sad, really.  And a whole lot disturbing.

We woke up early the next morning and had a good breakfast at a divers' cafe.  It was nice and cool, and we took a lot of pictures. ^_^  After the dropping by a PX shop and a National Bookstore (we couldn't help it -- we checked their stocks of Hallmark cards @_@), we went GO CARTING! We were so giddy waiting in line that we managed to piss of a group of Koreans racing before us (we were screaming and cheering and doing the wave -- when they got off it looked like they were cussing at us).  Ten laps for P300 -- but after charming the administrators (hahaha!) they gave us 12 laps for the same price.  Oho, sometimes it's great being a girl.

We drove back to Manila to the tune of Eraserhead songs.  Currently, we're making a music video of the whole trip, and it's sure to become blackmail-worthy.

Wendi, my officemate, invited me out of impulse one day to come with her to Puerto Prinsesa, her hometown.  Out of impulse too, I said yes.

Sometimes, it pays not to think.

<p><img align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/palawanaerial.jpg""></p><div align=justify>Palawan has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the planet.  From the plane window, lush green lands greeted me, and it was so surreal I honestly felt dizzy (then again maybe I was just airsick ^_~).  As soon as we landed we headed to Honda bay where Wendi's dad rented a <i>bangka</i> for all of us.  We toured the islands, and each of them had their own kind of beauty to flaunt.  It was great -- sharing lunch on one big banana leaf and snorkeling -- but the best part was the boat ride back to the port.  I have never seen the sky so wide and the sea so great.  Sitting there on the old fishing boat, I marveled at how the afternoon colors changed into so many shades; I've never seen such a beautiful sunset in my entire life.  Everything was so beautiful, and it made me want to cry.

<p><img align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/palawanbalsahansmall.jpg""></p><div align=justify>After hearing mass the next day, we headed to the <i>balsahan</i> in Iwahig, where we celebrated the birthday of Wendi's dad with <i>lechon</i> and <i>alimango sa kamias at gata</i>, among others.  It was literally a <i>feast</i>, and I enjoyed eating by the stream watching kids jump into the clear waters.  People told me that the place was enchanted, and as summer sunlight gently filtered through the trees, it seemed to me that it really was.

<p><img align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/palawansandbarsmall.jpg""></p><div align=justify>The same day, Mike brought us a few blocks from their house to a fishing village.  He kept on telling us, <i>""Ayos lang kayo ha, maglalakad tayo sa may dagat ng mga 30 minutes,""</i> and all the while we thought we were going to walk <i>along</i> the shore.

Apparently, we were going to walk <i>through</i> the sea.

Our destination was a sandbar far-off from the shore.  The water we waded through was knee to thigh-high.  We followed a worn path boarded by sea grass and jellyfish, taking with us our cameras, a bottle of <i>lapad</i>, and a labrador.  It was tiring, and at some points scary, but hell, when we got there, it was BEAUTIFUL.  

The water was so clear, and starfish nonchalantly went about their business as we all sat in silence.  In the end, we didn't get to down the <i>lapad</i>; we were all just there, sometimes sitting, sometimes wading, but almost always happily silent.


<div style=""text-align: center;"">(Here's my favorite picture of the trip.)</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/friends/palawanreflection.jpg"" border=""0"">
(Yup!  That's me!)</div>

You know when sometimes, you're in the middle of something and then you just suddenly realize that wow, you can't ever forget that moment?  During one evening as Mike took us around the city on his motorbike, I looked up at the sky and saw thousands of stars.  The wind was threading through my hair and we kept on laughing about something and it just came to me -- <i>""life is f*cking beautiful""</i>.  I wasn't drunk; in fact I hadn't had a drop the whole day.  Everything just crashed into me and I threw my head back and giggled like a toddler on sugarhigh.

I'll always remember that moment -- speeding through the quiet Palawan streets on my first motorbike ride.  One day, I'll do that again.

I'm still happily recovering from all the money I spent this summer, so I guess it means no more outings for me for the meantime. ^_^  Maybe sometime October, haha.  One of our supervisors invited me to come with them to Sagada; maybe I'll take them up on that.

Isn't the world a beautiful, <i>beautiful</i> place? ^_^"

me and my officemates have been working our asses off for a new product.  i don't know what it'll come out but i know that i'll totally laugh my head off when i see it in national bookstore outlets.

the only escape that we had was our trip to subic a couple of weeks ago.  the beach was beautiful but plankton-infested -- meaning you wade for a while before running out screeching and scratching all over the place.  wade, itch, run out.  wade, itch, run out.  we did that routine over and over again.  we were stubborn -- we weren't about to be bested by creatures at the lower end of the foodchain.

when we returned to manila, it was back to work.  yuck.

last friday, my officemate ody and i performed for an office function.  she sang and i played ""angel"" by sarah mclachlan.  it was my very first time to be in front of an audience outside abelardo hall; moreover, it was my first time to have somebody singing beside me.  truth be told, i am a bit uneasy about playing anything other than classical guitar -- probably because i am not really that good in the first place (after four years i still have a hard time reading notes and i almost can't read tabs), and because the training was made so that it doesn't entertain any other influence outside it (which is both a good thing and a bad thing).  

in any case, i think i did a good job accompanying ody, who's a really great singer.  i got the chance to talk with the company president, a man who's got an ear for music.  apparently, he's got a son who's a piano major in UP.  we chatted for a while -- at least now he knows me. ^_~

<lj-cut text=""sweet dreams~!""><div style=""text-align: center;""><b><font size=""+1""><font face=""Courier"" color=""#800080"">sweet dreams~!</font></font></b></div> 
my boss gave each of the girls a spritzer of ""pillow perfume"" for christmas.  the innocent-looking liquid apparently gives one ""a good night's sleep and sweet dreams"".  wendi, my groupmate, gave it a try and told us the next day that she did have a nice dream though she couldn't remember what it was about.

tyrene and i agreed to do the same that evening.

the next morning she said <i>""gumana siya~!""</i>.  apparently, she dreamt about walking in <i>intramuros</i> on a nice, cool morning, and she felt really happy.  <i>""ang ganda ng gising ko!  ikaw, gumana ba sa yo?""</i>

in fact, my friends, it did.  more than i would have expected it to.

i dreamt i was looking for rianne (another officemate) in this strange white place.  a door materialized in front of me, and i knocked.  it took a while before it opened but when it did, i reeled back in surprise.

standing with one hand on the knob was this tall, handsome asian guy with nice pecs wearing nothing but a white towel around his waist.  i actually remember trying to hide a silly smile when he let me in.  he was <i>hot</i>.  <i>HOT.</i>  i gingerly stepped inside and i was floored by <i>dozens</i> of tall, handsome asian guys with nice pecs in those goddamn white towels.  then, as i was sinfully frolicking towards rain (that korean guy from ""full house""), there was <i>igiboo</i>.  i don't know why the heck she was in my dream but there was igiboo.  she gave me a broad smile (not unlike that of a <i>mama-san's</i>) and while motioning earnestly towards those half-naked men, she said, ""CHARLENE!  WELCOME!  yes, yes do come in! <i>do come in!</i>""

and then i woke up.

tyrene was laughing hysterically by the time i finished talking.  later that afternoon, we told our boss about it and she said, ""hey wait a minute, i should get my own bottle too!""

am i repressed?  wait, don't answer that.

<lj-cut text=""suitors""><div style=""text-align: center;""><b><font size=""+1""><font face=""Courier"" color=""#800080"">suitors</font></font></b></div> 

last christmas, as in every family occasion, i was asked --

""<i>charlene?  may</i> boyfriend <i>ka na ba?</i>""

 i said ""no"", and as per tradition, my dad went on with his famous lecture.

""if you're going to have a boyfriend, make sure that he treats you properly.  he must be able to feed you, and take care of you, and give you a house...""

around this point my mom cut him short.  

""we aren't talking about a <i>husband</i>, dear.  we're talking about a <i>boyfriend</i>.""

""it doesn't matter.""  my dad is very stubborn when it comes to my love life.  ""<i>ayoko ng panay pa-pogi lang.  pa-pogi ng pa-pogi wala namang natapos o napag-aralan!</i>  i want him to be able to provide for you.  i don't want just anybody out there.  remember that <i>ha?  remember that.</i>""

since it was christmas, my grandma was with us.  she had been nodding all throughout my dad's lecture, and with half-lidded eyes and nose held high she said, ""your daddy's right.  you must get a capable boyfriend.  <i>wala pang nagkakamali sa <b>familia</b> natin.</i>""

every time she uses that <i>f-</i>word, i feel like i'm the daughter of some <i>haciendero</i> in a cheesy afternoon soap, who wouldn't get her inheritance if she doesn't marry a rich man of noble birth (who by some accident was switched with a poor kid back in the hospital where he was born thus making him live a hard life full of self-made misery and stupid martyrdom).  

that evening, i lay awake on my bed for about an hour or so.  i kept on thinking, ""what if i don't want to marry the proverbial corporate dude?  what if i don't want a posh condo in makati?  what if i want to raise my family in a quaint little house in italy?  <i>what if i want to marry an <b>italian cheese maker</b>?!</i>""

thus began the infamous list of <i><b>charlene's probable suitors</b>.</i>  technically, it's a list of men with different nationalities and cute jobs and which interest me.  that sheet of paper made it around the creatives department and with the help of my officemates, i got around 60 probable (imaginary) suitors and counting.  

here are a few from the list.  if you want to add a suitor, place your suggestion on the comments section.  it will be very much appreciated.


<b><font face=""Courier"" color=""#000000"">charlene's list of probable suitors</font></b>

italian cheese maker

i'm gonna be changing my lay-out soon.  i figured -- ""look at my background image.  what a poser!""  haha, i honestly can't play well on the electric guitar (sorry, diwata), since it's carried and played differently from a classical guitar.  so i'll work something out and draw something that's more <i>me.</i>

"event","hello friends!  it's been a while since i posted.  ^_^ a lot has happened since last year, but it'll be too much to post everything.  all's good though, in spite of the momentary bouts of psychological hoo-hahs.

i don't think i'll be able to post as much anymore, since i wouldn't have access to the internet most of the time.  (it's a long story, but if you want to know the details just ask me the next time we see each other.)  hopefully, that would be remedied soon, since i do miss them clickity keyboard sounds at 1 in the morning.

anyway, as much as it's the start of the new year -- well a couple of weeks since the start of the new year -- i think it would be proper to write my resolutions.  they're simple enough, so that it's possible for me to <i>really</i> do them.


<font color=""#800080""><font size=""+1"">charlene's happy new year list</font> </font>

<b><i>i will...</i></b>

... study capoeira.  or at least enroll in a gym since the 4:00 classes in ateneo would conflict with my 4:30 guitar classes in UP.

...write more.  though i have been writing (stuff that i won't be posting but hopefully printing), i think i should practice my style more (if i actually have any).  i read through my stories and i think i'm becoming too wordy.  if mrs. fernandez were still alive, she would check my papers and return them bleeding.

...learn to control my temper.  i found myself shrieking like a banshee last week in <i>divisoria</i> due to an annoying dumb ass <i>tindera</i>.  my officemates left me, and i was hella embarrassed.

...watch all the dvds that my friends lent me.  <i>sheps.  andami nito.</i>

...finish my drawings, especially gio's request.  (see?  i didn't forget about that.  sorry it's taking months.)

...spend more time with my friends.  

...go out of the country.  the world is just too big not to explore!


hm.  the list looks boring but at least my resolutions are realistic. ^_^  check on me again this time next year, and i'll give you a bar of chocolate for every resolution that i didn't get to follow through. ^_~

hopefully i'll get to post sooner than next saturday.

thanks for all those who commented on my last entry.  actually, i wasn't expecting anybody to read it, much less react to it, what with it being absurdly long.  it was actually just a release, a mental ramble.  still, thanks for those really nice comments.  they're appreciated.  :)

well, i haven't written anything much these days since i haven't had access to the internet.  that and i've been busy playing ffii, hahaha... emulators are such glorious things.

i'll post something substantial soon enough.  just a few things before i hit the sack:

<ul>
<li> i've been writing again.  like <i>really</i> writing.  thank god.
<li> i'm still hunting for a laptop.  
<li> be posting gio's request of payne soon.  or at least the inked version of it.  i still haven't gotten around to painting it with gouache since i don't know what effect gio wants and i don't wanna ruin it.  so gio, how do want it? :)  
<li> because i am such a fan, i made another ""juan aswang"" fanart.  i'll scan it and put it up as soon as i'm not lazy.

"event","(Disclaimer:  This entry might not make sense to you, my dear reader, but I just needed to write it down.)


No person in the entire planet who works in an office is ever safe from <i>chismis</i>.  Not even if the said office happens to be owned by a company which plans and distributes an international greeting card line that promotes love, camaraderie, and respect.  

In other words, yours truly has been most honored to be <i>chismised</i> about.

It wasn't much of a <i>chismis</i> -- then again it wasn't the full story.  According to one of my groupmates (our department is divided into groups), this girl whom we'll call -- um -- Girlie (pardon the un-creativeness, half of my braincells are dead), reportedly expressed her extreme annoyance towards me to our other officemates.  Apparently, Girlie thought that I was <i>""papansin""</i> and <i>inis na inis na raw siya sa akin</i>.

Now, I am not one to easily believe such gossip.  In spite of my experiences in the past, I still have faith in most people, and even if Girlie isn't somebody whom I would call a friend, I believe she's nice.  Well, half the time she's nice.  (Half the time she chooses to ignore my existence.)

Anyway, the <i>chismis</i> made me think about certain things...  (Enter cheesy flashback music.)  

In the past, in spite of all appearances, I was mighty insecure about myself.  I was insecure about my looks, the way I dress, the way I talk, and even about the way I move.  I wanted to <i>belong</i>.  I wanted others to see that I was an okay girl, that I was <i>acceptable.</i>  Moreover, I wanted to please everybody.  I held their opinions in high regard, to the point that I was ignoring my inner voice.  I was scared that people were talking about me behind my back, because I knew that if they saw something bad in me, they wouldn't want me anymore, and I wouldn't have ""friends"".

Yes, I was very much afraid of <i>chismis.</i>  Thus, I conformed.

That went on until college.  I tried very much to become a wallflower.  During my freshman year I wore nothing but sleeved shirts, baggy pants and rubber shoes.  My hair was long and most of the time unkept.  I really didn't want the attention.

And then came my mom who told me that no matter what I do -- even if I were to stand really still and stop breathing -- I would always draw attention, whether or not for good or ill.  It was just my personality.  I exude this (and I quote) ""vibe"" when I enter a room that it's impossible not to notice that I'm there, even if I'm just sitting in one sorry corner.  That's according to her.

Later on, I started believing her.  It's hard to explain but couldn't be sneaky even if I died trying.  So basically, all that wallflowering drama was for naught.  I attracted attention whether I was noisy or silent.  

But then it was more than just ""the vibe"".  In my opinion, there is another, more physical factor as to why I attract attention:

Boobs.

Yes, I am well-endowed.  I am chest-fully blessed.  <i>Maganda ang hinaharap ko.</i>  <b>I have big boobs.</b>  

I've had my fair share of men, women, and gays looking down <i>there</i>  instead of up <i>here</i>.  For some reason, they all found my breasts rather fascinating, in spite of the fact that they have their own.  Moreover, I've had thousands of boob jokes thrown my way (and yeah, most of them are funny).  I've learned to live with all that.  And yes, I love my breasts, even if they do attract undue attention, and even if they give some people the impression that I'm nothing but an airhead.

Anyway --

As much as I learned living with big boobs (yes, you get used to it), I learned how to live with ""the vibe"".  It has worked for my good as much as it has worked for my ruin.  I've had people telling me that I am doggone annoying even if I don't even remember doing anything.  I remember some people telling me that I'm a flirt, while others just thought that I'm plain <i>kulang sa pansin</i> and <i>over-acting.</i>

Somebody from a few years ago even told me, ""You walk funny"".  

""What do you mean?"" I asked.

""You stride.  You bounce.""

I never noticed that I did until then.

""You don't like it?""

""Not really.  <i>It attracts attention.</i>""

And so silly little me tried to change the way I walk.  Instead of ""bouncing"", I tried ""shuffling"".  I shuffled for the longest time until I got tired of it and realized that hell, why the eff should I care if I bounce when I walk?!  Why should I effing care if people don't like it?  It's how I walk, and it gets me to where I'm going.  Sorry if it ain't a pretty sight.

From that time on, I realized that I didn't care anymore what other people said about me.  The words <i>KSP</i> and <i>OA</i> just went in one ear and out the other.  I started wearing tank tops and skirts.  So what if they stared at my boobs?  That's the closest they'd ever get to me anyway.  So what if my heels clicked a little too loudly on the pavement?  Remember -- I ""stride"" and ""bounce"" and I'm not about to change that.  I've tried changing and conforming for so long, and I've gotted tired of it.  I stopped listening to them, and I started listening to <i>me.</i>  

It was very liberating, finally learning how to be your own person.

I will never again be slave to the opinions of others.  The only opinions that matter to me are from those who truly accept me the way I am.  <i>Those</i> are real friends -- not the ones who try to change you so that you'll conform to <i>their</i> standards.

Yes, I'm still insecure about a lot of things, but now, I'm happy just being myself.  I'm not perfect, but I'm me.

Oh, Girlie's <i>chismis?</i> It doesn't really matter.  I can't please everybody, and I'm not even gonna try to.  Let them talk till kingdom come, I'll be happy living my own life.  

This is me.  Take me or leave me.  It's your choice.

It's really that simple."

"event","One evening after work, I stood with my officemates near an FX loading sign along C5.  Beside me was a man in a white polo, and a good meter-and-a-half behind him was a suitcase, sitting in the middle of the sidewalk as if it were nobody's business.

Being the <i>scandalosa</i> that I am, I blatantly pointed at it and said -- ""Look!  An abandoned suitcase!  A bomb!""

Almost everybody in our line looked.  My friend Kate tugged at my sleeve, ""<i>Baka naman may may-ari niyan.</i>""

""<i>Eh bakit walang pumupulot?</i>"" I countered.  ""It looks like an effing bomb!  That's scary shit!""

The man in the white polo looked at me with an almost annoyed expression, while the rest of the group murmured in agreement and slowly edged away from the aforementioned object of apparent doom.

It was really, REALLY suspicious.  After all, it WAS sitting on the sidewalk of one of Metro Manila's main arteries.  I was debating between kicking it to a corner or asking an MMDA officer to radio it in, when calmly, the man in the white polo picked it up and crossed the street.

We stood there for a full minute, gaping after the suitcase's owner.

""<i>Ay</i>,"" I muttered.  ""<i>May may-ari nga</i>.""

And we burst out laughing.

We were still laughing when we boarded an FX, until another thought crossed my mind --

""AAAGH!  TERRORIST!""

But the FX had already started moving, and the man in the white polo was nowhere to be found."

and perhaps for that reason,
in my fiftieth year I find myself reflecting
on my relationship
with food and eroticism; the weakness
of the flesh that most tempt
me are not, alas,
those I have practiced most...</i></div> 

(hehehe... true though.  maybe we don't ""sin"" too often.  maybe sometimes, to sin is to find what is godly...  i hope i won't wait for my fiftieth year to sin a hell lot! Xp)

i love her way with words.  she even has this beautiful photo of herself on the backcover --

<div align=""center""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v350/diwatanghabagat/artwork/isabel.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""></div>

that is just so darn NICE!  i want to have a photo of me that's something like that -- naughty, but very artistically done.

anyway, i shall go back to my reading now.  (isabel you're my idol! *hearts!*)"

here's a couple of text conversations with my mother:

#1

ma: SAAN KA NA?
me: white plains na
ma: saan ka ibababa, sa mrt station?
me: hindi, bahay na daw.
ma: okei, tenkyu kami hapi beerday. :)

that was WEIRD.  for some odd reason, she sounded like ms jess.  and i don't even know where the ""hapi beerday"" came from.

#2

me: i'm home na. :)
ma: omigosh! praise the lord!
me: BLEH.
ma: PPTHTHTH

okay, that was the first time she ever texted me with an ""omigosh"".  and what in the world is a ""PPTHTHTH""?

my mother is funny."

"event","I finally opened my yearbook.  I was a bit apprehensive to do so at first due to certain issues which I wrote about way back, but when I browsed through the pages, I realized that in the end, I did have a good time in college.  I met great people too, and seeing their faces as they were a couple of years ago made me feel a tad bit nostalgic.  I see some of them often, but I only hear stories about most.  

I miss those whom I rarely have time to be with.  Reading through the yearbook made memories come back to me like scenes from an old movie.


<font color=""#800080"">Chad</font> -- I remember sitting on the library steps one afternoon during my last semester.  I was a total emotional wreck then.  I didn't really want to be alone, so I texted Chad and asked him where he was.  Apparently he just got back to his dorm across Katipunan, but when he sensed that I wasn't doing pretty well, he came back to school, walked up the lib steps, and sat with me.  We didn't say much to each other -- he just sat with me.  And that was a lot.

<font color=""#800080"">Mia</font> -- I remember a lot of moments with Mia, but one of the clearest was of that night we sped through Katipunan screaming our heads off in her car.  Life was unfair, and all we could do was to rage against it with fists to the air and mouths wide open.  It felt so damn great.  

<font color=""#800080"">Mihk</font> -- I remember singing ""Be Our Guest"" with him.  There was also his Naruto jacket and his Naruto pose.  And then there were those simple, silly conversations within which he would manage to slip in little by little the meaning of life.  I don't know where he got all his wisdom, as much as I don't know where he got his copy of ""Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter"".

<font color=""#800080"">Jean</font> -- I remember our conversations along an empty SEC walkway.  She told me that when she died, she wanted them to play Imago's ""Alay"".  I answered that I wanted Cookie Chua's ""Paglisan"", and then I said yeah, ""Alay"" too.  We talked about climbing trees and playing shadows, and I remember feeling the afternoon breeze against my skin and seeing the Acasia branches slightly swaying.

<font color=""#800080"">Cris</font> -- I remember rainy days in Starbucks Katipunan, and all those stories about lovers who have come and gone.  I remember her exclaiming ""What a stupid ass!"" before ranting about the aforementioned -- er -- ass.  Back then I could only shake my head and laugh.  But that's Cris.  She was one of the few people who gave me strength during rough times, and I never even got to thank her.  Well, Cris -- thank you.

<font color=""#800080"">Jon Moll</font> -- He was a batch higher, but it didn't really matter.  I remember us shooting for his thesis film -- ""Kita-kits"".  I remember sitting on the back of Dan's old pick up in front of his house, while the group talked about the rushes and how to get home.  I remember looking up at the night sky and seeing stars.  I didn't know there were a lot of stars in Paranaque.  I remember thinking, ""Life couldn't be better than this.""


Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever share such moments with these people again.  We live different lives now, and we bother about different things... Then I realize that knowing them and having the chance to be with them in the four most enjoyable years of my life is more than enough.  

In any case, I know we'll bumping into each other soon.  We're still friends, after all.  In my book, we'll always be."

today i splurged.  besides buying a pair of pants, i also got me two pairs of shoes -- one on sale, and one not-quite-on-sale.  the latter was a  pair from linea italiana which i've been drooling over the past two weeks.  it was only today with cheryl's prodding that i decided to buy it as a gift to myself.  the guy in the story already knew me as the girl who kept on (obsessively) fogging their show windows, so when i finally paid at the counter, he laughed and said ""<i>ma'am, di nyo natiis, noh?</i>""

<i>talagang di ko natiis.</i>  c'mon, i only splurge this much once in a while!  i knew that if i didn't get those shoes, i wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.  hehe, right now i'm happy.  ^_^  money <i>can</i> buy happiness.  well, most of the time.

"event","i told myself that i will NOT buy any more books after i got a copy of ""right words a the right time"" which cost me more than a thousand pesos.  but since i had to wait for my dad to finish his meeting and i had nothing else to do in megamall today, i went to powerbooks.  eff that place!  i just ALWAYS have to buy something everytime i'm there.

i got me ""the count of monte cristo"" by alexandre dumas.  not only that, i also bought sarah mclachlan's ""mirrorball"" and the pepe smith's new album ""idiosycrasies"".  that's easily another thousand out my wallet.

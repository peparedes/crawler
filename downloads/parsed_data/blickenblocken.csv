"event","Know what I miss? Gameboy. Before it could fold, before its back lighting or its fancy rechargeable battery. Back in the day when it was vertical, took four batteries, had four colors and a contrast wheel. I hate these new 3D handhelds. They seem so cold. Maybe I'm just getting too old for games. Maybe I've got too many memories of Donkey Kong and Pokemon that I can't fully appreciate the newer games. Lately though, I've just been completely unable to even look at my DS. Maybe I just don't have the kind of games I like. After all, Nintendogs is only interesting for so long, it only kept me interested for three days. I find myself going to Fred Meyer's and often buying games at random in hopes that I find a rare gem that lives up to the fun and entertainment that the old Gameboy games offered, but I have yet to find one to do so other than Harvest Moon and Metroid Fusion. On the other side of the coin, maybe I've just bought too many games in my time. I may have too many possessions to care for many of them anymore.

I think I'm going to find a niche in the Gameboy home brew community or something. I miss that battery draining brick of excellence.

Goodbye childhood, and happy early birthday to me."

"event","I was talking to a friend a few moments ago, who asked if I kept a journal. I said something along the lines of ""kind of, technically, yes, I guess."" Then I thought back to this lonely livejournal and all the other journals I've abandoned in the past. Writing journals are never really interesting at the time, but I realized that it's neat to see how you thought in the past. In a journal I kept during the summers of '00 and '01, I was apparently the biggest douche bag someone could imagine. Being a 6th/7th grader at the time of writing that journal, it was kind of expected for me to sound immature and naive.

So here I am, reviving this journal for the time being to look back on it in the coming days, months, perhaps years, to remember back to the good times. The times I think about regularly after it has happened, but never record, so I don't have much memories devoted to them once they're forgotten in the future and the moments are lost. I don't want to lose my current thoughts, experiences and musings."

"event","The alarm sounded, but I was already awake. I had been conscious for several minutes now, watching the clock, waiting for the very last second so I could get up and turn off the alarm before it came to 7:00. My internal clock must've been a bit off, 6:59 felt shorter than it'd always been before.

	I let the penetrating buzz go thrice, but caught it before I had to hear it's distorted call a forth time. Ten more minutes and I'd be on the way to school. I went along with my morning ritual. Dressed, brushed, watched as the kids at the bus stop across the street boarded a worse hell than their destination. I hated that bus.

	Turning the headlights on, the gas pedal was depressed in reverse and then in drive, pulling out onto the main road. Crossing the railroad the stoplight turned yellow behind me. I had yet to ever be stopped by that light, every morning it'd turn yellow as my car passed under.

	About the same time I turned on the radio, I was too lazy to get out my FM transmitter and mp3 player that particular morning. The Clash was on the classic rock station, looks like the morning was getting better.

	Struggling with merging onto the highway, the side windows fogged blocked from seeing anything to my side. Relying on my rear view and the green and gray blurs beside me, I felt the coast was clear and the turn signal clicked.

	I remembered I'd had physics homework the previous night, the homework that I didn't do. Along with the rest of it. Books were brought home, but were then left in the corner never to see the light from outside the bag. Why were they even brought home, I'd often question, perhaps it was just habit by now. Too bad not doing the work and returning to school empty handed daily was also becoming a habit.

	A now common fantasy came to mind as the offramp became visible around a wide curve. What if I didn't go? Why not, just for a day or two, leave? Go past the distant Eielson base. Keep the acceleration steady until the clean city roads end and the dirt paths begin.

	I hesitated with the turn signal. Staring into the dark and wet space ahead, I heard a voice strongly question.

	The voice echoed for a moment, ""Should I stay or should I go?"""

"event","I woke late in the afternoon, trying to shield my eyes with a comforter in hopes of another hour of sleep to pass the time. Before I could settle, I looked at the glow from the window. This wasn't sunlight coming through my window. It was a fiery red ambience shining from outside. I didn't bother opening the curtains, it was apparent that something was wrong outside and I took it upon myself to see what was happening. I put on my clothes and shoes, as I rushed for the door, leaving my shoes untied.

I opened the door to feel a rush of heat greet my face. Not a warm afternoon breeze that I expected from a summer day. It was as though the air was set fire. The burning singed my throat and I couldn't see over ten feet ahead of arms length from squinting so my eyes wouldn't hurt as much. Even so, I could see a neighborhood in panic. The hills surrounding this now unfamiliar place weren't covered with the bright green grass I was used to seeing. They were charred from this heat, the grass was all dead and I saw adults I didn't know yelling in frustration at a house down the street.

""What the hell is going on,"" a woman yelled, holding a small dog that she hadn't realized was surely dead from the heat by now.

""It's a war,"" a man I'd never met replied, ""it's a damn war!""

I didn't bother to listen to the rest of what they had to say. It was a war, that's all I needed to know. I figured the people had established this house as a makeshift headquarters. There was a trench dug from the already sunken ground of the ditch. Men were huddled together in the trenches, distributing what guns and ammunition they had. I'd always heard that in this state there was an average of seven guns per person, but I'd never believed it. I believed it now, seeing the rifles lined up against the trench walls for as far as I could see. I decided to go into their headquarters to see if I could get more information or an escape route map or something. I walked in to see many of my friends standing there, just as confused as myself. Then gunfire.

I grabbed the nearest weapon. A sword. My luck never failed to disappoint me. I pushed the people I knew upstairs, telling them to get armed and ready. I went back outside to see what we were up against. I was thinking Russians, Chinese, North Koreans. Something human. These weren't humans, but floating heads. The kind of things I'd seen in my Dungeon and Dragons books, when I was into that sort of thing. Beholders. They all had a single eye, which looked to be their only weak point I saw as bullets ricocheted off their iron skin. They were like ants, coming in waves over the reddened crescent of the hill.

In all the excitement I hadn't noticed what was causing that red glow. Under the floating beholders was a thick layer of oozing lava. I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but it was about to spill into the trenches when the men began retreating. The heat ignited a few that weren't fast enough, the beholders caught the rest. I took a step back into the doorway, watching the trenches fill to the brim and the beholders rush forward. Their mouths open wide enough to swallow me whole, it seemed. I shut the door, held onto the hilt of my sword tightly and looked around for support. Everyone had gone upstairs and here I was left to fight an army of the natural and supernatural with a sword. What was I doing? I'd never held a sword in my life.

I was brought back to reality when a beholder crashed through the door, and my first reaction was to swing. Swing like hell. I gouged at the beast as the burst of splinters from what was a door settled. The sword finally pierced through it's eye and it let out a high pitched scream, but I had no time to let my skin crawl, a second now filled the doorway. I lifted the sword to swing, and it strafed to my right. I was vulnerable with my sword down and the creature knew it. I did the only evasive maneuver I could think to do. I fell flat as it screamed past me. It crashed into the wall and a third pulled in to meet a blade to his eye.

This wasn't killing them off fast enough, they were going to overwhelm me soon. I'd dealt with three, one of which wasn't even dead, and the lava was already coming up to the house. I hit the fourth with a strike downward, pushing him downward. His tentacles lay on the ground momentarily and the heat from the lava instantly ignited one of them. With a swift kick, he rolled into the molten rock to incinerate, the flames taking two more with him.

By now they'd learned to crash through the walls which made me decide to fall back to another choke point. The hallway. I stood there and waited for the beholders to rush in and tried to keep tabs on how far the lava had advanced. It had gotten to the outer walls and smoke bellowed in, making my sight worse. Jaws emerged from the smoke and I stabbed into the middle of them. A fountain of blood spewed out onto my face and arms, and I pushed the blade deeper into the flesh. It screeched and howled and I swung it down to fling it off my sword, before it figured out it could bite down on my arms. I lifted my sword to find the end of it glowing a bold orange, and looked back down to see the lava a few feet ahead of me.

The next choke point was the staircase. I struck a beholder with my melting blade, hopefully putting it in enough panic to keep it off me when I tried to bring myself up the stairs. The smoke was starting to fill my lungs and there seemed to be no way out of the house. Still, I pulled myself up the stairs by the railing.

At the top of the stairs I found the room where everyone I'd ordered to retreat was. This was the last spot I could hold off the beholders at. I wasn't going to get through this, but maybe they would. I waited in the doorway for the mass of teeth and fire to consume me. Nothing came. I waited a while and carefully peeked down the stairway, the beholders had crowded in at once. They were stuck! The lava began with the lowermost, I could tell from the screams of agony and the sulfuric smell of their flesh meeting the flames.

I pushed the blade into the front one as deep as I could, it replied by snapping it's jaws at me, which was just what it needed to get free from the mass of the others. I had jumped back in fright when it got free, not realizing I'd let my sword go. I wasn't going to go near it unarmed, so I ran back to the room with the few remaining survivors. The beholder came after me slowly, weakened. I must've struck a vital organ. I was safe, from the beholders, at least. I closed the door behind me, blocking the smoke that crisped beholders didn't in the staircase.

Trying to think of an escape from the house, I glanced hopefully at the others. Then a noise from outside the door. A chilling noise. I opened the door to see the beholder I'd thought I'd killed to be laying on the carpet, the yellow from his eye and the blood stained shine from his teeth illuminating the surrounding smoke. He was laughing. I think he was laughing. I hoped he wasn't.

In his pupil I could see another group of beholders behind me. I turned to see nothing. The survivors stood there as dumbfounded as myself. Then something clicked. They hadn't said a word. They hadn't screamed, cowered, prayed, anything. I got up from kneeling near the beholder and walked back to my friends. I looked at them closely, trying to make sense of the situation. I couldn't think of what to say to start questioning the situation. There was too much to even ask about.

I stared into one girl's eyes. Hoping my glare would make her say something that I couldn't. As I turned away, the reflection in her eyes met mine. At the angle, I saw beholders, but when I looked at what would be reflecting, I saw the people I knew.

The girl's jaw then popped and contorted to open wider. I kept staring into her eyes, she was not who I'd thought I'd known. None of these people were who I thought I'd known. They all stared forward, straight faced. The jaws wrapped around my neck and I felt my shirt dampen with my blood. I fell to my knees, trying to breathe through the blood pouring from my mouth. My eyes hemmoraghed and I stared at the girl through a thin veil of red as she sank her teeth into my arteries.

My throat let out gurgles and a faint squeel of pain and the red turned to black as I heard the beholder's chuckle fade."

"event","Elections for next year are tomorrow. A group of my friends are running
together, all as write-ins, as the ""SWA"". Students With Attitude. If
you're thinking of the question I think you're thinking of, yes. They
did rip the name off of the ""NWA"". If not, you should be thinking of
that question.
Anyway, everyone they're running against is a bit agitated at the SWA
not having to follow the rules, since they're write ins and not on the
ballot. They don't need good grades, like the people listed on the
ballot do. They don't need any of the prerequisites to be in the
position they're running for, although they must still follow the
""equal opportunity"" campaigning. No extra mediums of spreading the word
if the other party hasn't had the chance to take advantage of them too.
The other people didn't want a commercial on the morning announcements,
and the opportunity was given several times. Now the SWA can't
show there's, even though the rule isn't ""equal opportunity, which has
been taken advantage by all parties running"".
<br>
<br>
But wait! A teacher today sees the SWA's new flier. They're all
standing behind the spirit rock (which is painted black and has the red
star and ""WRITE US IN!"" written in white under the star) and they hall
of their fists in the air. A subtle white glow borders them and the
American flag waves behind them. It's so over the top that I'd almost
consider it sarcastic. I guess you have to be fairly more extravagant
than running down the halls telling your friends to vote for you if
you're a write in. Back to the flier, a teacher had ordered them to all
be ripped down. The kid running for vice president doesn't have the
required GPA to be on the ballot. But wait! He's <i>not</i> on the
ballot. Write ins don't need to meet the same conditions as ballot
candidates. After contacting the teacher in control of student council,
the other teacher was chewed out and since the SWA lost a third of
their campaigning time by missing out on today, they can put up every
poster they have <i>and</i> can put their commercial on the morning announcements whether the others like it or not.

<br>
<br>
Of course, when the others in the race heard about this, they were
really happy. Well, until they heard about the SWA getting all their
campaign materials back and then some.
<br>
<br>
Also, I got a bad haircut today. The lady cut it right above my eyes,
rather than just below my eyes. So now I have hair prodding at my
eyelids, which is annoying. I'll also have to relive the horrible
experience of when my hair is level with my eyes. Plus it just look
bad. At least it'll be a good amount of time before I need a haircut
again. I hate haircuts. It's the mirrors. Looking at a mirror for ten
to fifteen minutes is awkward and makes me notice every detail of my
hair and face that I don't like which leads to being self conscious.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, it won't matter once it grows out a bit. I can't wait for that
to happen. Right now it feels like hundreds of needles are digging into
my skin and it hurts even more to know that soon it'll be cutting into
my eyes. I even told her ""Right below my eyes."""

"event","What a productive day it feels like it's been. When in reality, I've done nothing. It must feel productive because a few interesting things happened today and last night.

First is last night. See, the past few days I've seen that Hummer commercial where the car is driving through that white abyss and some kaleidescope effects are thrown in and overall it looks pretty clean and stylish. Something was eating at me though. ""What is that familiar song?"" I kept asking myself. Last night it hit me. It was like a speeding... well... Hummer had crashed into my head in the form of excitement. Ratatat. Seventeen Years.

That's right. Ratatat - Seventeen Years is on that Hummer commercial. Their music is quite possibly the greatest indie rock to squeeze through your ears. I thought you should be aware of this.

Now that I'm about to say ""Onto today..."" I realize, today wasn't all that interesting. I avoided most of my friends as to not clog the halls since I know how much I hate those large groups of people in the hall. They block everything. I wouldn't want to think of blocking the halls and then consciously block them. It's okay if I do it without thinking about how I'm going to help clot the pathways, but knowing it and doing it is even more hypocritical than doing it without realizing it. We got to go outside for a class and I actually got my work done. Nothing interesting out there besides finding the volume of several shapes and being chased by a bee.

Then some ugly girl and a good looking one took their shirts off and traded them on the bus. I didn't look though, since they had asked no one to look. Plus in order to see the pretty one, I would've had to completely turn myself around which would require the ugly one passing through my line of vision and would probably get me hit or yelled at. I figured it's just like seeing a girl in her bathing suit, so it's really not worth pulling such a move. I'm not one to do such a thing anyway.

I'd rather talk about something I like talking about. As much fun as commercials, hypocrisy (or lack thereof!) and an ugly girl without a shirt on is, I'd prefer to be witty and ramble on about a deeply intriguing topic. When I think of one, you'll be the first to hear of it."

"event","I'm back. With less money and more iPod than ever! Cleaned out my account to buy an iPod for $300 at the new Fred Meyer's here. Yeah, new Fred Meyer's. We had a small one, a big one, and then they closed the small one and opened a second big one. Which isn't cool, because the smaller the store, the more I like it usually.

Speaking of small stores, Pirate Records is just as cool as it's ever been. A human mind is unable to fathom how a kid can fit that much stuff into a store. The guy must have about 1000 vinyls, a few hundred cds, a tv, patches, buttons, space for band and event advertising, a sticker book under the new release rack, and a shirt rack in that store. You'd think it'd be cramped, but there's just enough room to feel like a cozy nest embedded in this city. Too bad it's been taking forever for their supplier to get the Mogwai CD I ordered (a month or two ago) in. The clerk has no idea why it's taken so long, he guesses there's a special edition or something being made, halting the current prints from being sold so they can be replaced then put up for grabs. Now that I have no money and no call that my CD has come in, I have no reason to go to Pirate Records. Which is sad, because I'd spend all day in that place if I could. Especially since the clerk that's always there, he must own the place I figure, knows which band I'm talking about everytime I mention one. I ask for the new Wilco CD, he replies ""A Ghost is Born, I think I have that here."" When I had ordered that Mogwai CD, he mentioned the horribly overpriced (but rare) bootleg Mogwai CD he had in stock. Although the first time I went in there, I got him when I asked for stellastarr*.

Speaking of stellastarr*, I'm happy that so few know of them. I don't think they're even listed on allmusic, which makes me feel very in the know. At the same time though, I wish more knew of them. I made my friends listen to my favorite stellastarr* song and they hated it. They're industrial/metal junkies though. They'd inject liquid Combichrist, In Extremo and Knorkator into their veins if they could. Every group has to have the random indie kid though. ""Death Cab for Cutie has a new CD due out in September!"" I say. ""What? I was too busy listening to loud, emotionless machines."" They reply in unison. (By the way, a new Death Cab for Cutie CD is due out in September.)

Although I can't say I don't like industrial. The above paragraph makes it sound like our choices of music never overlap. Rage Against the Machine seems to be common ground for all of us. Because if you haven't listened to a Rage Against the Machine song and liked it, then you're a communist. No one wants to be a communist. Although they teach you that sharing is good at school, they really mean ""be greedy and use the most underhanded tactics to get what you want in this great country!""

I just got a great visual of a little second grader accusing another second grader of insider trading."

"event","My mom went to conferences and apparently I'm passing all but one class. That one class is chemistry. I should be able to pass it easily though, I just stockpile the work in that class and get it finished the night before end of quarter and/or semester. That F should be boosted to a B, at least, in two weeks. Then I have a better grade in French than I do in English. I'm not sure if I should be proud or embarrassed for that, but either way both grades are passing and that makes me feel good.

The only other class I may have trouble with is geometry. I've never been too good with math. It bores me beyond belief and bore leads to easy burnout. I do one problem and say to myself ""Well, time to take a ten hour break..."" At conferences my teacher told my mom that instead of doing the old missed assignments, I could just do some project. I'm thinking a morbid math comic or something of that sort would do. Maybe get some friends together and make a little film project. I think my geometry teacher would appreciate that, since he's also the video productions teacher. My friends have made A+ movies for school in an evening, so I'm sure with two weeks I can think up of something, organize it and get it done. A comic would be much more fun and convenient to show around though.

Oh, and I witnessed a kid bench 225 today. It was crazy. By kid, I mean a big senior, technically an adult by now I think, but I still think of him as a kid. And even though he weighs over 300 pounds or something like that, it was still cool to see someone take on that much weight.

Whereas I could only get 60. I was the second weakest kid in there. I just haven't worked any muscles strenuously since my surgery since the surgeon said I couldn't lift more than 10 pounds for the first two months, then my mom doesn't want me to lift anything heavy for probably the rest of my life. She doesn't even want me in gym next year because she thinks I'll die or something. People are stupid, I'll tell you that much now. I didn't get a surgery to be more vulnerable to death, I got a heart surgery to <i>live</i>. 

""Are you going to die?"" 
""Yes."" 
""I mean... from that surgery."" 
""Maybe... I don't know."" 
""If I punch you, will you die?""

"event","It turns out that Employee of the Month is <i>awesome</i>. I loved the scene at the strip bar (that's not a good way to start a sentence... I hope my grandma doesn't read this) where the main character's friend, Jack, describes a difference in men and women's brains. He talks of the chemicals released from in your brain when you have an orgasm, men get some sort of sedative and women get a stimulant. ""They want to cuddle and talk and feng shui the living room"", I think he said. Then he goes on to say that the longer a woman is with a man, the more secure she gets, the more chemicals released during orgasm and she becomes addicted to her own ""snatch smack"". Yes, that's right. Snatch. Smack. And that's just one reason to see it. There's also the dozen twists at the end, the random person on fire, pistol whipping, slow motion gunfights and such.

What also turned out to be great was this site: <b><a href=""http://www.improveverywhere.com/home.php"">Improv Everywhere</a></b>. It's a group of people that set up various scenes in public and get a pretty good mix of reactions. I love the Safety Shark and McDonald's Restroom Attendant missions.

I hate driving. It's the worst thing. I don't care if it gets me places faster, I hate it. I hate turning left when someone is on the corner, I hate people being so close to me in their giant speeding masses of metal and plexiglass, especially when I'm in Alaska where the snow is starting to melt in the day and freeze at night giving side roads that nice ice sheet that no one knows how to drive on. Here's a tip, don't try going around a corner at 20 mph when there's no gravel and plenty of ice. I saw someone <i>barely</i> pull it off today. I could've sworn they were destined for a ditch, but they pulled it off by getting traction at the last second.

It really is crazy how people drive up here. It's especially funny when I see people that have gone off the road (especially the highway) where there is no ice. They must get their tires in the loose snow and it sucks them down or something and they don't figure out what's going on for another 100 yards or so. Oh, I actually saw a flipped Hummer a few months ago. HOW DO YOU FLIP A HUMMER!? Those things are wider than the road!

I've seen I <3 Huckabees, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I, Robot, Wake of Death, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and Collateral. That's seven movies and I still have two more to watch. Employee of the Month and Anchorman. We had taken the first five movies back to Blockbuster today and I spotted Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and thought ""Hey, people have been talking about that a lot recently, I might as well rent it"" and then I couldn't stop. I think my mom may fear bringing me to Blockbuster because of my problem with movie rentals. I mean, we go home and I said ""Oh, we should've gotten Friday Night Lights, Star Wars Trilogy, Saw..."" I just can't stop now. I mentioned Star Wars Trilogy because I have never seen a Star Wars movie from beginning to end, besides Episode I. Same goes for the Alien and Predator movies, which includes Alien VS Predator. Same goes for the Godfather movies. In fact, I've never seen any gangster/mobster film from beginning to end. I did see a lot of Good Fellas once, though. What's strange about that is that I'm Italian. Whenever I hear a reference to a movie in a joke directed to me, I never get it. I only got the whole ""how am I funny?"" reference after I said someone was funny because I watch Family Guy.

Enough about movies. Onto money. Where does my money go? In Alaska we get a Permanent Fund Dividend that's about $1000 a year. I used to be able to coast all year with that money. Now it's gone before spring. I spent it all on food, bass, amp and a Nintendo DS. That wouldn't be $1000, though. That can't be. I got a really good deal on that bass and amp. Together they totaled about $300 and the Nintendo DS and Super Mario 64 DS was about $180 when totalled. That's only $480. Then food must be $50 total, since I usually eat at home and my mom buys the stuff at home. Well, now that I think about it I did get a lot of games, DVDs and CDs lately. I don't even remember spending my money. I should really stop carrying around my wallet so I can stop spending so much. I've been saving for an mp3 player and Threadless shirts for ages, but I never see more than $10 in my wallet anymore. I'm not even sure that I have enough for snowboarding tomorrow.

anything and it's making me want to do things less somehow. It's not a
rebellion thing, it's not a lazy thing, it's just that I'm burnt out on
it. I'd much rather be out getting paid for labor than be sitting in a
classroom being paid with such crappy currency as ""knowledge"" that I'll
learn on my own if I ever need it anyway. Oh well, I guess everyone has
to go through it and I'm no different.

   Today I saw I Heart Huckabees. Good movie, but it tried way to hard to
be philosophical I thought. One side trying to help the main character
believes that everyone in life is the same and that we're all connected
and a lot of other crap that isn't really worth thinking about, but
they make it sound like it is. Then the other side helping him says
that nothing is connected and more stuff that isn't worth thinking
about. It had some funny parts, but it still wasn't as good as I was
hoping. I still have the rest of the stack of movies I rented from
Blockbuster to watch. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Sky
Captain and the World of Tomorrow, I, Robot and Wake of Death. What
bundle of rental movies would be complete without a Van Damme movie?
None, I tell you."

"event","I witnessed someone wait about four minutes for an elevator to go to the THIRD FLOOR.  She was in perfect walking condition and didn't appear to be sick at all.  She could've gone up the stair in about 15 SECONDS, but decided to wait for the elevator.  And that's not the first time I've seen it, either.  How can someone be so lazy?  Just take the freakin' stairs!

Anyway, let me tell you about the longest car trip I've had to take in my solo-driving history.  I went to visit Susan in Milwaukee this weekend and was planning on returning today (Monday), but my parents didn't like the looks of the weather today, so they asked me to leave yesterday.  I didn't want to argue with them, so I left and was making good time until I hit a highly concentrated snowstorm about 20 miles south of Chicago.    Oh wait...before I continue, I should mention the jerk SUV that was tailing me and got so impatient that s/he flashed her/his brights at me...so I pulled over a lane and let the SUV pass and watched as the driver continued to weave in and out of traffic.  All I could think was ""Please get nailed by a cop"" and what should my eyes see but a state patrol vehicle pull onto the highway right next to me!  The cop saw what the SUV was doing, caught up to it, and pulled it over.  It was a very sweet vindication of sorts.

Anywho...

So I hit this snowstorm on 94 and was stuck in traffic for about 90 minutes only to find that 94 had been closed off and they were forcing people off the highway into Michigan City, Indiana.  So, with some help from my parents (Santa, I need a new cell phone), I found my way to 80/90 and hopped on the Indiana tollway and continued through shitty weather.  I think the average temperature throughout this entire escapade was 12.  Fahrenheit.  I discovered that listening to football on AM radio (thanks Susan) keeps me much saner, especially if I have no vested interest in the game.  I stopped to grab some food, and the rest stop I went to had a McDonald's and a Dairy Queen.  Well, the line for McDonald's was super-long, and that's when I remembered that Dairy Queen doesn't serve just ice cream.  I got a BBQ chicken sandwich, ate it, and left before the people I'd entered with had even ordered their food.  Hah!

So I continued driving and the weather improved.  I got in at about 1:30 AM (having left at 4:30 PM, Ann Arbor time), unpacked, watched some TV, and fell asleep.  I should be thankful...and I am.  My car made it through the awful weather, with a little help from some random dudes who helped me out of a snowdrift in Michigan City when I was trying to turn around.  That was definitely fortuitous.  I didn't get tired, and the CDs Ryan Katz gave me kept me cheerful when the football was all over.

The girl who served me at Dairy Queen was a little high-strung since she'd had a non-stop stream of customers from 3-whenever I was there.  I almost wanted to tell her what I'd been through (having to leave my girlfriend a day early, driving through shit weather, and almost getting stuck in a deceivingly tricky pile of snow) so she could have things put in persective.  But that wouldn't have helped anyone.  I just paid for my food, thanked her, and ate.  You never know what someone has been through, and saying the wrong thing might set them off while saying the right thing (or nothing at all) might make their day.  Shit happens, but true character is shown through recovering and making the best of the shit.

Now I need to eat and practice.  One more final and then it's time to relax.

GO MICHIGAN! BEAT THE LONGHORNS!"

Okay, so yesterday, I got half of what I wanted.  I wanted to beat OSU, which obviously didn't happen, but I also wanted to win the bid to Rose Bowl, which we did (thanks Iowa!)

Some OSU fans treated us very classy-like during the game.  After the halftime show, a bunch of us went to use the bathroom, and while we were waiting in a very long line, a few fans came up to us and complimented our halftime show.  One of them said something along the lines of ""I can't speak for the other 105,000 assholes here, but I think you guys are really great.""  Then, one of the OSU band members walked by and looked at us quizzically and asked what we were doing waiting in line.  He then proceeded to walk us to the OSUMB's facility attached to their stadium and let us use their restroom.  That was also really classy.

Then OSU won and everything changed.  After the game finished, we had to sit in the stands while the fans rushed the field.  I had no problem with that.  They won the game really well and deserved some celebration.  What made me angry was the procession of thousands of fans who went out of their way to walk in front of the band and scream the same things at us over and over again.  ""I don't give a damn about the whole state of Michigan, we're from O-HI-O."" or ""OVERRATED (clap clap clap-clap clap)"" or any number of middle fingers combined with obscenities or ""No more Rose Bowl"" (which was kinda funny 'cuz Iowa was winning at that time).  Ugh.  I *thought* there were more classy fans, but this procession really made me think differently.  All we could do was sit there and take it.  It almost felt like some of the fans were being nice earlier in case they lost so that we couldn't say they were jackasses.  Sorry, I'm just a little angry.  It's tough to go to that stadium and lose because they hate us SO much more than we hate them.  I don't even hate them.  I'm an OSU fan 358 days of the year, and during the week leading to the game, I just don't care for their football team.  I don't hate them.  Oy.  Such a silly thing to hate people for.

"event","When I was in high school, my government teacher said that there are two Solon High Schools.  I understood what he meant to some extent.  I lived in the school that had AP classes, talented students, kids who had strong minds and opinions and good, clean habits.  The other school had college prep classes, lackluster students, kids who had weak minds and opinions and poor, filthy habits.  Now, we have to consider that the entire community of Solon is a bubble to begin with, and I lived in the smaller bubble within the bubble.  Only a small percentage of students lived in the same ""area"" as me.

Now I've started realizing how tiny that area really is.  Not only are there multiple Solon High Schools, but there are also multiple Americas.  The America I know is different from the America Vic knows is different from the America Justin knows is different from the America Gus knows is different from the America George knows.  Who are these people?  Well, you know who I am.  Vic is a co-worker of mine who lives in a much rougher part of Cleveland.  He sleeps with a .22 near his bed and has been making trips to the shooting range for the past two years.  Vic is 17.  Justin is my cousin who, last I heard, participates in street racing with a souped up car of some sort.  His family is not as well-off as mine, but they make do.  I've never known Justin to be the best student, but when it comes to cars, he knows a helluva lot.  Gus is a fictional person I just made up.  He is a farmer in Nebraska who works from February to November, tending crops and hoping for good weather so that he can make enough money to survive the winter.  Gus has no formal education, and he lives in the knowledge that has been passed down to him from his father's father's fathers.  George is our illustrious president.  His America is one of wealthy industrialists who own baseball franchises and make generous contributions to political campaigns.  He has gone to the top schools all his life (mostly because of his name and money), and he has been raised with the knowledge that he prob'ly won't encounter much in the way of personal strife in his lifetime.

By no means am I an expert in American life.  I can't begin to imagine the kind of life Vic goes through.  Two days ago at work, someone attempted to run over two other people in the employee parking lot.  When I asked Vic why the hell someone would do that he rattled off a list of things like ""power, greed, respect.""  He told me about a twelve year-old he knew who had a sawed-off shotgun in his house because he'd been jumped by six or seven guys who stole his clothes and shoes, making him walk home in his undergarments.  Vic works as much as he can so that he stays away from that.  He tries to make money so that he can go to college.  He has the right intentions...but he still sleeps with a gun next to his bed, and I pray that he never has to use it.  So does he.  I can't begin to imagine...

I want my children to grow up in a safe environment.  I want them to know that they'll have dinner on the table when they get home.  I want them to be able to walk home from school worry-free.  I want them to go to school without being concerned about weapons and drugs.

But I don't want them to be blind."

Anyway...I'm gonna be an RA this year.  I'll be in the burlodge and I'll have my car.  Things are starting to fall into place.  And I get to see Susan in a week.  We celebrate our two-year anniversary on Wednesday.  Hard to believe.  Wait...no it isn't.

I also taught a drumline in Florida for a week.  Mr. Stein had some very flattering comments about my teaching.  Prob'ly the best one was something along the lines of ""You are buddies with all the students, but they also know when not to cross the line and when you're serious.""  That's exactly what I want out of my students when I teach.  I want them to feel comfortable around me while still keeping in mind that they're under my tutelage for a reason.  I really felt that with these kids.  Granted, there were only seven of them, but you have to start somewhere.  It all stems from respect.  I respect the students and give them encouragement, trying new things to get the rhythms down, and they realize I'm trying to improve their musicianship and thereby respect me.  By the end of the week, I had kids borrowing CDs from me 'cuz they liked the music I was showing them.  I also had a bunch of the students tell me that they wanted me back the following year 'cuz the former instructors they had were jackasses.  All of that plus a couple visits to Coldstone means I had a great week down in Florida.  I also beat Jak & Daxter on PS2.  Also cool.

Our softball team lost tonight.  I had some good defensive plays at second base...but I also had some bad defensive plays.  This was the first round of the playoffs, and we are now eliminated...y'know, since we lost.  I always feel responsible for us losing 'cuz for some reason, the last plays always come to me.  I have to keep in mind that I also made some good plays...some.  Geez, and we were even up 12-3 after the second inning.  Ho hum.

Last night, I saw a collection of musicians from several bands including Toad the Wet Sprocket, Nickel Creek, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, and Led Zeppelin.  That's right...I saw John Paul Jones perform last night.  The six of them were called Mutual Admiration Society, and they were fucking SWEET.  Their vocal harmonies were amazing, and the mandolin player...wow.  He was a beast.  Great live show in a small setting...very chill, very fun.  Two encores, etc.

My parents bought a 36"" flat screen TV with 6.1 Dolby Surround.  It's their anniversary gift.  With that purchase, they got another DVD player, so I think I might have one at school this year...in addition to the SNES.  I think these are things an RA should have...y'know, in case the residents wanna chill.  But then I'd need a couch of some sort...or seating.   We'll see what I can come up with.  I should get one or two of those fold-up camping chairs from Walmart or something.  Sound investment...those things are sweet.

It's been a busy time, but more than anything, I just miss Susan right now.  Granted, I'll be seeing her soon and I'll be making a trip to Chicago for the OSU/Northwestern game, but that still isn't enough.  I'm really hoping that she moves to Lansing soon.  That'll allow for more time together.  That's all I really want.  Time.  Granted, if she happens to find her niche in Milwaukee, far be it from me to ask her to move.  If she's happy there, then that's what's most important.  I need to keep telling myself that :-)

Oh, and Michael Lerner (who works for my dad and is a parent of younger Solon students) has been mentioning that he has talked with other parents around the community who say that they certainly wouldn't mind me taking Curtiss' job once he retires.  Boy would that be interesting.  Tough act to follow, big shoes to fill, whatever saying you wanna use.  Would I really wanna teach in Solon?  And am I even deserving enough of the position?  Better practice piano.

I also have to get some rest.  Four days of work left.  Yowza.

Our Entertainment team is 2-2, and both of those wins came in games where I wasn't present.  I'm starting to think of giving my place up to someone else because my thinking tells me that I have a better chance of getting my $40 back (which the champion team does) than if I actually play.

You may say to yourself ""Benri, you can't be that bad!"" But I pretty much am.

Tonight, we played last year's champs, and we were up 12-8 after four innings.  We were playing really well.  But then they started hitting to me in left field.  I let two playable balls go over my head, and that resulted in 6 or 7 runs...I can't remember.  I was also the final out for our team.  I did get on base twice and score once, but that's only because I can run pretty fast.  At any rate, we endud up losing 21-18, which isn't too bad...but we would've won if not for me.

The thing that bothered me most, though, was the way the other team was acting.  It's expected that people will talk shit during these games, and we experienced it a lot in some of our other games.  I expect it.  But the team we played tonight was really just a bunch of assholes.  One dude on our team, Ric, really wanted to start a fight, and I almost wouldn't have blamed him.  Some dude on their team was running into him when going around the bases and talking shit about his mom.  It was pretty blatant, and when Ric bit back, we were all telling him to be quiet and just play, but he made a good point: nobody on their team was telling their dude to shut his assmouth.  They were all telling Ric to be shut up.  It was pretty retarded.  Oh, and their catcher loved talking shit to every batter that went up there.  First he told me Michigan sucks, which I expect.  I was wearing a Michigan shirt.  Next at bat, he told me my necklace was crooked and that it looked funny...and that I'm a twig and that a stiff wind would blow me over.  I had a bat and he didn't...the temptation to misuse it was pretty strong.  I signed up for the league to have fun, but people like the Furlong Kadoodees (the name of the team we played) make me want to not play.  They bring out the worst in me.  So I think I'll just tell our team captain to bring in substitutes for me.  I'll play if he can't find one, but I imagine just about anyone is better than me at outfield.

"event","I am not intelligent.

For a good portion of my life, I have been told that I am academically gifted and have an exceptional mind.  I've believed it all until I began reading these books by John Holt, ""How Children Fail"" and ""How Children Learn.""  I've discovered that in a world of producers and thinkers, I am a producer.  And that is bad.

Thinkers are people who are given a problem that challenges them (challenges, not threatens...that means it's in their capacity to complete the problem) and they wonder why this problem exists and which of their skills can be used to solve it.  They reap great satisfaction from coming up with an answer, not because they have a response, but because they have simplified their world and now understand something else about it.  Producers are people who are given a problem and focus solely on coming up with an answer.  They don't care what the problem is about or what skills are necessary.  They are merely concerned with finding an answer so that the stress of the problem disappears.  They are people who would rather be wrong than uncertain because if you're wrong, you know it.  If you're uncertain...well, you're uncertain.

Ever since first grade, I have sped through classes like math and spelling because those are classes that, in elementary school, focus on producing answers.  I just happened to be an excellent answer-producer.  However, when given a problem that I did not understand, my methods collapsed and I merely produced something that would relieve the stress of uncertainty that weighed upon me.  One such instance occurred in fourth grade when we were given little plastic eggs to look after for a couple weeks.  We were to record our doings with them and turn the journal in at the end of the project for whatever reason.  At first, I had no idea what to write.  I kept thinking that I couldn't do anything with it because it was a plastic egg.  Sure, we named them and drew faces on them, but it's plastic!  What am I supposed to do with it?  After about a week of complete confusion, I had a conference with my parents and teacher in regards to the project.  They told me to be creative and treat the egg as if it were a little brother or something.  So I made a story about me and ""Eggford"" going to the mall.  In this story, he got kidnapped by aliens with guns.  I somehow saved him using a helicopter or something...I can't entirely recall. At any rate, I pumped out a bunch of gibberish, producing an end result that the teacher didn't care for...but it was an end result, and that's all that mattered to me.

Going through middle school and high school, I continued to excel in most area except for English.  Of all my subjects, that was my least favorite because it was not a class in which I could produce answers.  I got mostly B's which is sub-par for me.  My parents were always saying that I could do better.

The problem is this:  I learned how to manipulate the system.  Everything from spelling quizzes to standardized testing was in the palm of my hand because it all centered around producing answers.  I rarely thought about what I was doing, and when I entered college, it showed.  My classes actually wanted me to think, and I couldn't do it the way they wanted.  Engineering was not for me in more ways than one.  I didn't like it, but in addition to that, I wouldn't have been able to perform in these classes further down the road.

Music is where I truly excel.  It is the field I love to think about.  There are no answers to produce, so it forces me to appreciate the inherent beauty of music.  It just is.  There aren't any equations or facts to memorize ('cept in music history...which I'm done with).  Music simply is.

By the way, I apologize to any people whose grammar I have corrected.  That is such an asshole thing to do because it screams ""I know more than you about English, and here's where you are lacking.""  That's something I'm going to eliminate from my habits as it is a terrible thing for an educator to do.

The quote of the day at work:

Pam: Do you mind if I eat your pickle?
Me: Man, if I had a nickel for every time a girl asked me that...

The end.

The mustache is gone.  It met a sad fate this morning when I slowly destroyed it with a Mach 3 razor. Three blades is ridiculous, right? WRONG.  Anyway, I went to church with my parents.  It's Father's Day/my mom's birthday.  I decided to be a good son and go with them...although I was 10 minutes late.  Made it just in time for the Gospel.  Anyway, when I got there, my mom looked disappointed about the lack of mustache.  She said that it was actually starting to look good! And then, when I got to work, one of the boat drivers asked me what I'd done to the mustache.  Weird.  I never thought I'd actually want to try growing it back.  Maybe we'll see in a couple months.  Perhaps I'll attempt the full blown goatee.  I dunno, I feel like facial hair makes me look really greasy...like a used car dealer or something.  Throw in a plaid jacket and I gots me a new career.

Anyway, my brother and I got my parents an offer to take them out to dinner wherever they want to go.  My brother really did it creatively, though.  He bought a postcard with three pigs on the front, cut it into pieces, and put some of the pieces in my dad's card and some in my mom's.  Then, after assembling the postcard, they read the back and it said ""How about dinner at Tony Roma's?""  I thought it was clever, and I'm sure my parents appreciated it.  I just wish I'd thought of it.  I do care about my parents.  I don't want them thinking that I didn't put any thought into a gift for them for these occasions.  I just don't really know them well enough to get crap for them.  My parents usually buy something if they want it.  Our family has money, that's what they do.  My mom is especially hard to shop for, but oh well.  They know we try.  They like it most when all the sons are together and we're having fun as a family.  I don't really think they enjoy each other's company.  I hate to think what'll happen when I'm done with school and am living on my own.  I don't really plan on asking for much of their help.

Speaking of living on my own and getting a job and whatnot, I'm reading more of those education books that one of the music ed professors sent out to us.  Today, I finished ""How Children Fail"" and began ""How Children Learn,"" both by John Holt, a pillar of knowledge in the education community.  The first was great, and the second is terrific thus far.  The first book made me realize how pathetic our education system is, and the second, so far, is increasing my sense of awe and wonder in regards to little kids.  They're TONS smarter than we give them credit for.  In fact, Holt asserts that everyone is born intelligent/smart, and it's school that messes people up.  After reading ""How Children Fail,"" I almost agree with him.  Some crazy shit in that book.  Check it out.

I am also the only Henri boy with a steady girlfriend now.  All my brothers are single.  My mom used to say that I'd be the first of her sons to get married, and I always thought this was poppycock, especially since one of my siblings was engaged, once upon a time.  But these days...I dunno.  It's really weird.  I'm incredibly happy with Susan.  I'm not going to predict or live in the future, but things are going well and I hope they continue that way.  I don't know what happened with my brothers.

It's food time.  I've barely eaten all day.  Prob'ly have s'more beans and/or turkey.

Good night, angel bright.  I love you."

Okay, so maybe I don't want to be EXACTLY like him, but I want to be as passionate.  He was always open to ideas, and he really lit a fire under those 10 year olds' asses.  I know the real world doesn't usually work that way, but I'd like to come as close as possible.  One of my ideas is to have a different song playing every day when my students walk in.  I'd like them to hear different styles of music by different bands from different eras.  And not just bands.  Composers, songwriters, from the 1500s to the present, from Aaron Neville...well, maybe we'll skip to ABBA...all the way to zydeco...or ZZ Top.  Although there aren't many people out there who truly enjoy EVERY type of music, I'd at least like to be able to show my students that all music can be APPRECIATED.  You don't have to have a degree in theory or music history to know that music is an incredibly special act that we humans perform.  No other creature creates music.  Sure, birds ""sing,"" but a lot of that is preprogrammed or instinctual...or mimicry.  You don't see other animals composing sonatas or playing a ""face-melting"" solo on an old Les Paul.

Whew.  I need to lie down.  Music rocks.

"event","When I was leaving work today, I saw a bumper sticker that said ""Caution: Driver just doesn't give a shit anymore."" Or something like that.  I kinda related it to how I've started acting.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I do give a shit.  But I certainly don't give a shit about things I used to exert a lot of effort giving a shit about.  Make sense?  Good.

I used to make a big deal about drinking and people who drink and the party atmosphere and college and America binging on everything.  I only really care about one of those things anymore, and it's the America one.  Everything else...I don't give a shit.  I'm all for going out bowling tomorrow night and drinking with my friends.  Why the hell did I care so much? Was I afraid of breaking the law? Of disappointing my parents?  Was I naive?  I certainly didn't become omniscient in one week.  Is this what they call growing up?

Swearing.  Swearing is actually kinda fun, and sometimes regular words just don't go far enough.  I made the excuse of not wanting to get into the habit of swearing in the instance that I might curse in front of my students.  But then I remember that one of the coolest things one of my teachers did was to say ""You bet your sweet ass I am"" in front of the guys of that class.  It was funny.

Maybe I'm being corrupted by my co-workers.  Maybe I'm loosening up.  Maybe I'm separating myself from some of my past.  Whatever the case, I just need to ensure that I like who I'm becoming.  And I do.  And I think people have already taken to it.  I don't wanna be uptight.  I wanna be fun...but responsible at the same time.  I definitely think it's possible.  I think the reason this whole metamorphosis doesn't bother me is that it's helping me change the mindset that my parents planted in my head.  I don't want to think as they do 'cuz frankly, they're neurotic.  My mom's a neat freak, and my dad is a control freak.  It's really annoying.  That's why I've been going out with friends every night.  I hate being here with them.  I'll spend $30 every day if it means I can get the hell out of the house.  I would much rather be with my friends.  Hell, I'd rather be by myself, so long as I'm away from these psychos.

"event","I will be the first person to tell you that I'm no good at sports.  Now, that does not imply that I'm out of shape.  On the contrary, I'm in excellent health.  I just never focused any energy into athletics 'cuz I don't like competing, particularly against my friends.  I used to think that I loved arguing with people.  That may have been true, but nowadays, I find it far more agreeable to be on the same side as my friends.  This is why I've started rooting for all sorts of sports teams, rather than rooting for only Michigan and Cleveland based franchises.  Here's a list of teams I've been known to root for, especially in recent times.

NCAA Football:
Michigan
OSU (and most Big Ten teams...unless they're playing Michigan)
BC

NFL:
Browns
Steelers (unless they're playing the Browns)
Patriots
Lions

NBA:
Cavs
Pistons
Pacers
T-Wolves

Hockey:
Red Wings
Lightning

Now some of you may think, ""Benri, what the hell are you doing rooting for OSU/Steelers/rivals?""  My answer is this.  When I get together with friends to watch a game, I don't want to argue with them.  I want to be able to cheer on the same team and enjoy the company of others.  Rooting against one another is pointless.  I can root for the opposing team on my own and prob'ly have just as much fun.  Some people take sports fairly seriously, and that's their prerogative...but I just think arguing about sports is dumb.  I want to sit down with my friends and not care who wins.  I want to have a good time with my friends.  So, I'll usually cheer for whoever the crowd is cheering for.  If the crowd is split, I'll just spectate.  It's a very Quaker-esque way of viewing sports.  I'd rather be in accord with my friends.  Again, arguing about sports is dumb.

Oh, and fuck Kobe Bryant."

I usually use this journal as an excuse to write to people and let them know what's going on.  I was looking back on what I'd written in the beginning days and saw that in my first entry, I said this would be a place to record my thoughts rather than record my doings.  Boy was I ever off.  I've almost entirely recorded my doings rather than my thoughts.  Strange.

Anyway, the person I usually write for is Susan, in the hopes that she reads and knows how things are going.  Mostly, I do this sort of thing so I can write my usual final line.  I know that whenever I read/hear Susan write/say ""I love you,"" my day is infinitely better.  Those words perform magic on my heart and mind.  And I usually write these things so that I can keep people up to date, yes, but also so I can say

"event","Okay, so tonight was my first night out drinking with people.  I waited until I wasn't breaking the law ('cuz apparently, everyone becomes wise at the age of 21), and tonight I got buzzed.  I went out to Slam Jams with Melosh and Matt, and we had a good time.  Had some Labatt and...ummm...Gold-something-or-other.  It was a microbrew from the Cleveland area.

1) I don't hate beer.

2) I owe apologies to Susan, DJs, drumline people, friends, brothers, etc.  I'm making a conscious effort to not be so naive and uptight.  I'm starting to learn the ways of the world, and if I ever made someone feel immoral or in the wrong for drinking, I apologize.  I just need to loosen up, and I'm working on it.  We'll all drink together sometime.  It'll be fun.

3)Beer can be expensive.  And it can also put weight on you.  Still two reasons to not drink, but if I'm not concerned about money (which I'm trying not to be) and I don't care about my body (which I do, but shouldn't as much) then these are not reasons to avoid drinking.  I dunno.  It's still interesting to me.  When I actually get drunk, we'll see what it's like.

I saw a few people I know/knew from high school at the bar tonight.  I don't really wanna go to Slam Jams again.  Those aren't people I care to see.  I'll find other places to drink.

I sang ""September"" again tonight 'cuz it was karaoke night.  Once again, despite not knowing the bridge, I was still sweet.  My buds cheered me on, and I had some dudes actually start line dancing.  It was cool.  I like singing for people, and I hope to do it more often.  I should devise a karaoke repertoire for sounding sweet at clubs and bars.  Helps people have a good time.  Hearing tone deaf drunken idiots sing can get old REAL fast.  It's nice to hear talent.  That's not to imply that there were no talented people at the bar.  There definitely were.  But the untalented certainly outweighed the talented.

I'm coming off my buzz and getting tired.  Gotta work tomorrow.  Hope everyone had a good ""Benri's birthday.""  Drop a line sometime, we'll chat.

"event","What a crazy last name.  I don't know the proper way to pronounce that.  Anyway, I finished his book.

I calmly blew up at my parents today.  I got so frustrated with the childish way in which they treat me, I just grabbed my head with my hands and said very firmly ""Just stop talking to me.""  They did, which surprised me.  They just kept saying obvious things to me, asking me if I'd checked the pressure in ALL the tires when I filled them on Friday. As if I'd fill only two of them or something.  I'm not an idiot. Stop treating me like I'm 11.  There's a large amount of developmental difference between a 21 year old and a 16 year old.  I'm getting sick of being treated like I'm still in high school.  I don't know what aspect of psychology it is that makes me want to not listen to my parents, but I do know that when I'm at school, I'm way more responsible, and I don't need anyone on my back, telling me what to do.  Right now, I'm up against the team of mom 'n' dad, and there's no way I can win.  I hate being alone with my parents.  Now, notice I didn't say that I hate my parents.  I just hate being alone with them.  When I see the way they behave, I know why they wanted to get separated.  And I almost support that now.  There are cases where separation or divorce is just plain better for those involved.  It may be stressful on the kids, but in the end, they may be saved a lot of grief seen in arguments.  My mom is very particular about the way she keeps the house, and my dad couldn't care less.  She hates that about him.  I can see it.  My dad has a very conservative view of how a household should be run.  He doesn't cook.  He doesn't pick up after himself.  He doesn't do laundry.  He doesn't clean.  Since he's the primary breadwinner, he gets the comfort of coming home to relaxation in the form of TV and pretending he's a rock star playing piano (which is very annoying).  My mom is sick of having had to pick up after a husband AND sons for 30 years.  I wouldn't blame her if she left.  That's just the way she is.  I can't expect her to change after 50 years of a particular lifestyle.  It's possible, but I wouldn't ask that of her.  Ugh...enough.

This is why I work 60 hours a week.  I wanna be away from the house.  I should look for a new job, though.  I only got $300 for my 60 hours of work on my last paycheck.  Totally bogus.  Maybe things will get better when we start running shows.  That's what I'm hoping.  Last night, we worked the third shift from 7PM to 7 AM.  I didn't make it.  I fell asleep at 1:45, and my manager woke me up at 3:30 and said I could go home if I didn't want to be there.  I thanked him and got the hell out.  I wasn't going to risk my health for this job.  I needed sleep being as I'd been awake since 6:30 that morning and had a 3 hour car trip back from Ann Arbor.  No way.

Speaking of Ann Arbor...I miss my friends.  I wanna be back with the Dicks & Janes and back with the drumline and back with all the music people I know.  Or maybe I just wanna be away from home.  Sometimes I think that I made a hasty decision in going to Michigan.  It was the only school I visited, and I get the impression that if I'd gone to visit other campuses, I'd have had the same reaction of ""Wow, this place is great! Man, I really wanna come here.""  I could get an education degree anywhere...and for a much lower cost.  But I chose Michigan.  Why?  Because of the football program? Because of the marching band?  Because of the academic prestige?  Am I secretly and subconsciously spiting all those OSU friends I have?  What's the deal?

I have to go to bed.  I'm leaving the house at 5:00 tomorrow morning to go back to Ann Arbor for recording.  Wish me luck in not falling asleep.

Three guesses as to what I'm waiting for.  The following should not be any of your guesses:

1) days until my lobotomy.
2) days until I change 4,000 diapers of babies with explosive diarrhea.
3) days until I get a new toaster.
4) days until the end of the world.

Now that we've narrowed things down...I see Susan in 19 days.  I'm more excited about seeing her than I am about my 21st birthday.  That's in...ummm...16 days.

Work was kinda cool today.  Jars of Clay was playing in the park for a Christian music festival.  They're a good band.  They didn't have tons of equipment, so it was fairly easy to load them in and out.  Good guys.  The crap part of the day was the fact that it was rainy, cold and windy, and I had no sweatshirt.  Oh well.  Life goes on.

Last night, my dad and I went to Border's, and I was bought a few things.  I felt bad that he was paying for everything, so I bought something of my own.  My dad paid for a CD that I got (band called Broken Social Scene...good stuff, my brother recommended them to me) and two education books that I intend to read this summer.  Then I purchased Boondock Saints which is a sweet movie.  If you wanna watch it, gimme a call.

Yesterday, all the techs were running rides.  I was working at the Dominator (formerly Batman Knight Flight), which is the largest coaster at the park.  I got to check peoples' harnesses for hours on end...oh, and I also found out that the slowest way time passes is by being the person who makes sure that everyone is the right height for the ride.  People gave me really indignant looks when I stopped them if they were of a questionable height...but sometimes it's really tough to tell unless they're right next to the stick.  Anyway, the second half of the day was REALLY slow, but it wasn't as bad 'cuz I felt like talking to the guests and being nice...and that made things pass a little faster.  It wasn't too bad.  Something new.  That what makes the tech job fun.  We rotate shows and it isn't the same thing day in and day out.  Things are new and fun.  It's not too shabby.  My job, though crappy in pay, is still nifty.  I may complain about it, but hey...I have a job, and it's all good.

I'm also in the midst of a really good book alled Flow.  It's non-fiction about the psychology of ""optimal experience.""  If you wanna read it, the author's name is Mihaly wetfiohsaegojasdgfasdogasgohasepoutahsgdfojbhfbv.  Whatever, I can't pronounce the last name...one sec, lemme go get the book.  Okay, his name is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.  It's quite insightful, but it is also not a fast read.  I usually finish books pretty quickly, but I've been on this one for over a week.  After that, I'm moving on to those education books my dad got for me.  I look forward to reading all this stuff.  Oh yeah...one of the Music Education professors sent out a list of books we should read this summer.  That's where all this is coming from.  Super!

Well, I have to be at work for 7:30 tomorrow.  It's bedtime.

Perhaps this will help me be better at home repairs when I get out of school and start a family and whatnot.""  I've never really been a handy person, so sometimes it's nice to learn these things.  My dad knows tons about around-the-house things, but I don't ever like hearing about it from him because he's a terrible teacher.  Of course, now I'll start typing about what makes a good teacher.  Yadda yadda yadda.

I don't have time for that, though.  I need to go shower and go to sleep.

Good night angel bright."

"event","Great movie.  Tim Burton is splendid, and Danny Elfman is a genius.  The movie talks about time standing still when you first see your true love.  Well, I'll be honest and tell you that I don't recall the first time I saw Susan, mostly because it was probably while she was on stage at any number of concerts that I saw my brothers in.  Or maybe I first saw her during Anything Goes.  I honestly don't know.  But I DO know that there have been moments with her that were simply frozen in my memory.  Really quite wonderful.  I can't wait to see her in a few weeks.  I miss her so much.

Right. Bedtime.

"event","Oops.  Kinda forgot about this thing for a bit.

I have that Incubus song, ""Megalomaniac"" stuck in my head.  It's pretty good.  I'm getting better at exposing myself to different types of music.  I'm forcing my ear to not automatically tune out styles that I haven't historically liked.  I heard a pretty good hip hop tune today with Busta Rhymes and...uh...someone else.  And then there's always that Usher tune with Ludakris and Li'l John.  I think I have those names right.  Anyway...

I still won't listen to country :-)

I worked all the way to Saturday last week, and this week, I had Sunday and Monday off.  I don't know when my next break will be, but I wouldn't be surprised if I don't get much time off.  I have tons of days off that I've asked for, and three of the are the weekend that I go to visit Susan! Yay! Less than a month!

So yeah, after a ten hour day on Saturday, I came home to a chicken and rice dinner prepared by my mom...super yummy.  Just as we were about to sit down and eat, Lauren knocked at the door and we, of course, asked her to join us.  So she did.  Then she and I went to rent the Triplets of Belleville and watched it with her sister.  Excellent movie, I suggest it to all.  Then Sunday (yesterday), I did very little.  Once again, I ""went to church"" which means that I drove around for an hour, making my parents think I'd gone to mass.  I imagine this will become a pattern unless I'm working on a Sunday and I have to go to an earlier mass with my parents.  In cases like that, I don't think driving around for an hour will fly.  They might notice.

Then I napped a lot.  Then I played Starcraft.  I did some reading, and as the evening approached, I gave Lauren a call and asked if she wanted to watch Adult Swim on Cartoon Network since I just found out I had today (Monday) off and could stay up late.  She said sure, and we watched it.  Aqua Teen Hunger Force was strange. The new episode had a different voice for Meatwad and was much cruder than past episodes.  I was kinda upset.

Here's what also kinda upset me.  My parents either don't know me very well, or they are firm believers in the ""When Harry Met Sally"" theory of men and women can't be just friends.  Whatever.  As I was leaving my house last night to hang out with Lauren, my mom actually questioned where my commitment lies.  I told her very firmly that my commitment lies with Susan, and walked away.  I was mad.  I love Susan more than anything, and apparently, I don't make that evident enough because my parents questioned my fidelity to her.  Yes, Lauren and I have been hanging out together, but that's because Lauren is nifty and is actually home.  Is it impossible for a guy to hang out with a girl without having his intentions called into question? Ugh.  Frustrated me a lot.  Thanks mom.

Granted, they don't really know how much I sneak off to see Susan and how much I think about her and how much I love her...oh well.  *I* know where my commitment lies.

Anyway, most of today was spent playing Starcraft, but I did have a dental appointment where they told me I'll need to get a filling restored, get my wisdom teeth removed, and keep taking excellent care of my teeth.  That's right.  My teeth are awesome.  I'm kind of looking forward to getting my wisdom teeth out 'cuz I've never gone under for surgery or anything.  I've had local anesthetic which is super cool, but I've never been put to sleep.  Granted, I don't really want to deal with the aftereffects, but oh well.  Such is life.  I'll be chipmunk-y for a day or two.  It'll give me an excuse to watch cool movies and lie around all the time.  And eat lotsa yogurt. And pudding.

K, time to go do other things.  How's everyone's summers goin'? Drop a line, give a call, say hi!"

"event","Yay! I have my own little rut/daily schedule.  Now I know how 9-5 people feel.

For the past few days, I've risen at 6:30, eaten, showered, and gone to work until 5.  Then I come home, eat, maybe hang out with people or play computer, read, and go to sleep.  At school, I always wondered how people stay awake all day because I could barely do it.  But now I am able to perform like a normal person, and I get tired at the right times...that is, at night, rather than 10 AM.  I think I may switch my showering to evening, though, since I'm building a set and coming home full of sawdust and sweat.  That seems to make more sense.  Then, when I'm finally doing show operator stuff, I can take my showers in the morning 'cuz I'll be more awake.  If I keep this up, my summer should go pretty fast.  And I want it to...'cept the parts with Susan who just called. Yay!

My grades have started to roll in, and although I am waiting on one grade, I'm fairly certain that I will have one pass, 2 B+'s, an A- and 5 A's.  Good semester.  I should have over a 3.8.  Very nice.  People knock music classes, and even though my classes are decidedly easier than those of my friends in engineering, I think I'm studying in a field that is a little more specialized.  Not everyone can sing.  Granted, not everyone can do math really well, but I think the major challenge for me was getting in the music school.  Afterwards, it's a lot easier, mostly because I'm really interested in the material and usually like my classes.  I got a B+ in musicology which I was totally not expecting.  I was thinking I'd have a B or B-.  B+ is good.  As is the A in theory.  I have yet to decide what upper level theory/musicology course to take.  I have room, maybe I'll do both.  I also just realized that my final year in school, I'll prob'ly only be able to be an RA for the first semester 'cuz I'll be student teaching.  We'll see, though.  Something to look into.

I'm off to bed.  I'm in a wonderful mood.  I love Susan.

Remember when I said that my parents try to live through me and my brothers vicariously?  Last night was proof of this.  Lauren came over and we were hanging out when I got a call from my parents asking if I wanted to go grab some food.  I said yes, let's go to Quizno's, and Lauren came with us.  The car ride there and the dinner were both interesting, mostly because my dad paid tons of attention to Lauren.  Now, I can understand how this happens as Lauren naturally has a magnetic personality and is very easy to get along with.  The part that bothers me is that my dad pays more attention to my and my brothers' female friends than he does to his own wife.  I've never seen him act so friendly to the woman he's been married to for 35 years or so.  This man has issues.  He pays more attention to golf, piano, computer, his job, and his sons' friends than he does to his wife (each of those considered individually, not collectively).

More of those issues arose today when he messed up our computer.  I signed on this morning to check mail and whatnot, and the computer worked fine.  I get home and my dad claims that he has been working on the computer for hours, trying to get our LiveUpdate to work for virus scanning.  It won't work, and he went out and bought Norton AntiVirus again and called Symantec and went through tons of hoops to try to get the computer to work again.  He won't just say that he brought a virus onto the computer.  I know he did.  He was the only one who used it, and internet worked fine this morning.  Then he went into all the fun little applications and system files and checked and unchecked boxes as he saw fit, deleted files he thought shouldn't be there...this man knows nothing about computers and acts like he does.  Ugh.  I'm just really frustrated right now, and I'm not liking my father.

I have to go.  Early morning tomorrow.

"event","I just got back from my first day of work this season.  'Twas cool. I also just had major deja vu and am still having it as I type this entry.  I spoke with someone about the phenomenon and he told me that it comes from the brain storing something in long-term memory when it should store it in short term, and as the event is happening to you, you feel that you've done this before, you've been here before, in this case, typed these words before, erased that quote mark that you accidentally typed and started typing about deja vu while having deja vu.

Anyway...

Work was cool, even though I was doing something that is completely not in my job description.  First of all, I was up at 7:30, getting up and doing my job thing because work started at 8:30.  Actually, it started at 7:30, but my supervisor never told me.  So tomorrow is gonna be an even earlier start.  I'll be getting up at the same time as Susan! Well, maybe not.  But I'll be going to work at the same time, at any rate.

Anyway, we were working on building the set for the show that's gonna be at the Palace Theater in the park.  It actually looks really cool so far, and tomorrow is gonna be more building.  Before playing with the power tools, though, I was sent with two other TECHS to CLEAN UP the backstage area of Power City stage (formerly Gotham City stage).  Please note the TECHS CLEANING UP part of that sentence.  Not really my job, but I did it 'cuz they told me to.  Same with set-building.  Messing with the tools and doing something productive with them made me feel testosterone-enhanced.  Got splinters.  Dealt with the pain.  Built stuff.  Cut things.  Make fire.  Eat meat. RAAARRGGGGHH!

Now I'm gonna hang out with Lauren for a while 'cuz that's fun.

Oh, and my cousin sent me some CDs of bands he showed me when I was out there in February.  Good stuff."

Drinking is an easy way to gain weight, and even though I'm thin, I don't want to gain 10 or 15 pounds of drinking fat.  I want to gain good weight.  And I'm not about to start working out a lot just so I can start drinking.  Not worth it."

"event","I think I stumbled on one of the major things that brings me down: my parents.

For a really long time, I've complained about my parents and then been told that they've raised me and done so much for me and that I owe them a lot and shouldn't whine.  Recently, I've learned that this is bull.

My parents try to live vicariously through my brothers and I.  I don't really think they have a life outside of work and their boys.  Now, granted, when raising kids, it's difficult to balance all that, especially with four sons.  But when we're all either college grads, living on our own, or close to graduating college, you don't still need to do the things you did when we were 11.  The one thing that my parents have done that pisses me off is that they've brainwashed me.

My dad claims to be a liberal.  My brothers and I think he's a closet conservative.  He's very vocal about his hatred for Bush, but then he'll get excited when we make an attack on Iraq or Afghanistan and kill lots of ""bad people.""  Socially, they are fairly boring.  They have little excitement in their lives, and so they bother me and my brothers.

Okay, I'm going off on a tangent.  I know in my last entry I said that I wanted to be able to come home and have someone to take care of me.  Sounds like I want to be treated like an 11 year-old.  I s'pose part of that is true.  But I don't like the fact that my parents have a hard time discerning between when I want to be treated my whole age or merely half of it.

Mostly, I just don't like that I'm hesitant to do things like drink and party and curse.  Tomorrow, I'm going to go to church, because I know that if I don't, I'll piss my parents off and get car privileges revoked...like last time.  Geez, I don't even know if I believe in God, and I'm going to Catholic mass.  Isn't that something the Church says I could burn in hell for?  I hate going and seeing people go through the motions with no spirit, no vitality, and because of this, the priest also has no energy, no intensity that makes me want to get up and change things.  I feel like I'm in school.  It's the same thing every time, and I'm being lectured to by a person of authority.  Around me, people are distracted, looking around, yawning, falling asleep, watching their wristwatches, waiting to get out.  Is that faith?  Am I just going to the wrong church? Maybe I should learn more about Islam.  That seems like a religion that has a high respect for nature, as do I.  I once took a test online that supposedly tells you what religion you should be based on your answers.  According to my responses, I should be a Quaker.  That's not about to happen.

I want to not get sick to my stomach thinking about certain things that shouldn't make me sick to my stomach.  I can't really go into detail, but the fact that my parent's influence on my mind is causing me to feel like vomiting...well, that just makes me realize why I don't like coming home."

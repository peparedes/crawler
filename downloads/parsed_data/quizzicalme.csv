"event","&nbsp;You Should Date An Illiterate Girl
JAN. 19, 2011 By CHARLES WARNKE	
 
Date a girl who doesn&rsquo;t read. Find her in the weary squalor of a Midwestern bar. Find her in the smoke, drunken sweat, and varicolored light of an upscale nightclub. Wherever you find her, find her smiling. Make sure that it lingers when the people that are talking to her look away. Engage her with unsentimental trivialities. Use pick-up lines and laugh inwardly. Take her outside when the night overstays its welcome. Ignore the palpable weight of fatigue. Kiss her in the rain under the weak glow of a streetlamp because you&rsquo;ve seen it in film. Remark at its lack of significance. Take her to your apartment. Dispatch with making love. Fuck her.

Let the anxious contract you&rsquo;ve unwittingly written evolve slowly and uncomfortably into a relationship. Find shared interests and common ground like sushi, and folk music. Build an impenetrable bastion upon that ground. Make it sacred. Retreat into it every time the air gets stale, or the evenings get long. Talk about nothing of significance. Do little thinking. Let the months pass unnoticed. Ask her to move in. Let her decorate. Get into fights about inconsequential things like how the fucking shower curtain needs to be closed so that it doesn&rsquo;t fucking collect mold. Let a year pass unnoticed. Begin to notice.

Figure that you should probably get married because you will have wasted a lot of time otherwise. Take her to dinner on the forty-fifth floor at a restaurant far beyond your means. Make sure there is a beautiful view of the city. Sheepishly ask a waiter to bring her a glass of champagne with a modest ring in it. When she notices, propose to her with all of the enthusiasm and sincerity you can muster. Do not be overly concerned if you feel your heart leap through a pane of sheet glass. For that matter, do not be overly concerned if you cannot feel it at all. If there is applause, let it stagnate. If she cries, smile as if you&rsquo;ve never been happier. If she doesn&rsquo;t, smile all the same.

Let the years pass unnoticed. Get a career, not a job. Buy a house. Have two striking children. Try to raise them well. Fail, frequently. Lapse into a bored indifference. Lapse into an indifferent sadness. Have a mid-life crisis. Grow old. Wonder at your lack of achievement. Feel sometimes contented, but mostly vacant and ethereal. Feel, during walks, as if you might never return, or as if you might blow away on the wind. Contract a terminal illness. Die, but only after you observe that the girl who didn&rsquo;t read never made your heart oscillate with any significant passion, that no one will write the story of your lives, and that she will die, too, with only a mild and tempered regret that nothing ever came of her capacity to love.

Do those things, god damnit, because nothing sucks worse than a girl who reads. Do it, I say, because a life in purgatory is better than a life in hell. Do it, because a girl who reads possesses a vocabulary that can describe that amorphous discontent as a life unfulfilled&mdash;a vocabulary that parses the innate beauty of the world and makes it an accessible necessity instead of an alien wonder. A girl who reads lays claim to a vocabulary that distinguishes between the specious and soulless rhetoric of someone who cannot love her, and the inarticulate desperation of someone who loves her too much. A vocabulary, god damnit, that makes my vacuous sophistry a cheap trick.

Do it, because a girl who reads understands syntax. Literature has taught her that moments of tenderness come in sporadic but knowable intervals. A girl who reads knows that life is not planar; she knows, and rightly demands, that the ebb comes along with the flow of disappointment. A girl who has read up on her syntax senses the irregular pauses&mdash;the hesitation of breath&mdash;endemic to a lie. A girl who reads perceives the difference between a parenthetical moment of anger and the entrenched habits of someone whose bitter cynicism will run on, run on well past any point of reason, or purpose, run on far after she has packed a suitcase and said a reluctant goodbye and she has decided that I am an ellipsis and not a period and run on and run on. Syntax that knows the rhythm and cadence of a life well lived.

Date a girl who doesn&rsquo;t read because the girl who reads knows the importance of plot. She can trace out the demarcations of a prologue and the sharp ridges of a climax. She feels them in her skin. The girl who reads will be patient with an intermission and expedite a denouement. But of all things, the girl who reads knows most the ineluctable significance of an end. She is comfortable with them. She has bid farewell to a thousand heroes with only a twinge of sadness.

Don&rsquo;t date a girl who reads because girls who read are the storytellers. You with the Joyce, you with the Nabokov, you with the Woolf. You there in the library, on the platform of the metro, you in the corner of the caf&eacute;, you in the window of your room. You, who make my life so god damned difficult. The girl who reads has spun out the account of her life and it is bursting with meaning. She insists that her narratives are rich, her supporting cast colorful, and her typeface bold. You, the girl who reads, make me want to be everything that I am not. But I am weak and I will fail you, because you have dreamed, properly, of someone who is better than I am. You will not accept the life that I told of at the beginning of this piece. You will accept nothing less than passion, and perfection, and a life worthy of being storied. So out with you, girl who reads. Take the next southbound train and take your Hemingway with you. I hate you. I really, really, really hate you."

"event","<p>So this post has been a long time coming, but was prompted tonight by a post on The Sartorialist and a bunch of random Glamour.com creeping. It's about this current fashion-industry buzzword, ""curvy."" Curvy is not a synonym for overweight. It is a description of one facet of a body: the lines. I am curvy. Not because I think I'm fat or have poor body image, but because my body just happens to be made up entirely of curves. Some people are all straight lines; I am not one of them. Curvy also does not mean busty. Yes, those are curves, and sometimes they contribute to the curviness of a woman, but they are not the only factor. Curvy is not defined by weight or BMI or bra size or booty. It is a description of lines. Easiest way to check for curves: look at the silhouette. Front to back, side to side. What we're looking for here is variation in width. The perfect example of a curvy figure, by the way? None other than the classic, 36-24-36 hourglass. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>What I wanted to say to Steve Halloween: </p><p>I do not owe you a thing. I do not owe you one word of this response. I have met you twice in my life. I do not know you, and you most certainly do not know me. You have built me up in your head to be some kind of super awesome fantastic wonderful one-who-got-away after dating you for what you seem to think was the equivalent of about six months who was just irreversibly scarred by her (no doubt) cruel and undeserving ex(es) and was too sweet and kind an in love with you to drag you into her shit. Let me assure you, this is not the case. The fact is, you are attempting to make excuses for the fact that I turned you down. But that is the truth, plain and simple. I blew you off and you are trying to make yourself feel less rejected. Do not misinterpret my understanding of the situation as sympathy. Make no mistake, these repeated, unwanted efforts to contact me absolutely qualify as stalking, which serve only to convince me further that cutting you out of my life before you found out my address was the right choice. Contact me again and you will see a restraining order and, likely, my family's and friends' boots in your ass. </p><p>What I actually said:</p><p>It's not just history [that is keeping us apart, or whatever shit he came up with]. I am neither as amazing nor as damaged as you seem to think. I have tried to be polite, but apparently that is not working. Let me be plain: do not contact me again.</p><p><br>WAY less satisfying. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

The pretty  one, I have a hunch, is generally the instigator. With the plainer one  by her side, she thinks she&rsquo;ll look even more dazzling than usual. And  the plainer one goes along with the idea because she wants to bask in  her friend&rsquo;s glow&mdash;or maybe because she just doesn&rsquo;t get out much. I  don&rsquo;t know. I do know, however, that when I spot them and manage to push  in beside them at the bar, I often feel sorry for the pretty one.</p><p>Because she&rsquo;s about to learn she&rsquo;s not the pretty one.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you girls drinking?&rdquo;</p><p>The  pretty one answers for both of them in most cases. Hers is the dominant  personality, and her heels are higher, too. The plainer one (the  supposedly plainer one) isn&rsquo;t wearing heels. They hurt her feet, and  she&rsquo;s not afraid to say so because she has no image to preserve. This  makes her much easier to talk to. It also makes her more interesting to  talk to&mdash;and, as the night wears on, to look at. By then, see, the bar is  full of pretty women, and pretty women tend to look quite similar. They  may not look similar before they dress and put on makeup, but afterward  they do.</p><p>&ldquo;Where in Ohio?&rdquo; I ask the plainer one, who doesn&rsquo;t look  half so plain now. I like her nose. I like the fact she has one. The  pretty one had a nose at one time, but she hired a surgeon to cut most  of it off.</p><p>&ldquo;Akron.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love that city,&rdquo; I exaggerate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Depressing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Industrial.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s  when the pretty one, who&rsquo;s tired of standing around with nothing to do  but check out her look-alikes and estimate her own rank in the evening&rsquo;s  pageant, wanders off to use the bathroom. I don&rsquo;t really notice; I like  her friend. Her friend has hands that are too big for her wrists, and  when she gestures with them to make a point, I&rsquo;m mesmerized by their  power, their vitality. I&rsquo;d like to hold them, to feel them on my back. I  bet they&rsquo;re warm&mdash;much warmer than the pretty one&rsquo;s, which are small and  slender but look icy.</p><p>Could I have your phone number?&rdquo;</p><p>I ask.</p><p>The woman who&rsquo;s no longer plain at all says, &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>I  nod and hand over a pen. My crush starts writing. Her friend walks up  and sees what&rsquo;s happening. She stiffens. She narrows her eyes.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t pretty.</p><p>In  the fairy tale, Cinderella goes unnoticed until her appearance is  magically transformed to match little girls&rsquo; ideal of loveliness, which  they grow up believing is little boys&rsquo; ideal of loveliness. This belief  is wrong, though. And I should know, because I&rsquo;m a grown-up boy who  longs for Cinderellas who&rsquo;ve never touched a pair of glass slippers&mdash;who  are plenty alluring barefoot. I prefer them to some princesses I&rsquo;ve  danced with. I prefer them&mdash;these unconventional-looking women who too  frequently call themselves ugly or imperfect when they ought to call  themselves perfecting&mdash;because their transformations are still ongoing.</p><p>Maura,  the first barefoot Cinderella I fell for, was not a fussy eater, and it  showed. It showed in her substantial hips. It also showed in her  contented face.</p><p>Radiant happiness was Maura&rsquo;s best feature, the  kind that comes from filling up on pasta and not leaping up afterward to  go running. This distinguished her from the other girls I&rsquo;d dated  during my first two years at college. They were slimmer than Maura,  their features more symmetrical, but their facial expressions were  harder and more anxious, particularly at mealtimes. Salad without  dressing will do that to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I scrunch in here with my  tray?&rdquo; I asked her in the dining hall one evening. She smiled and  scooted over to make room. I&rsquo;d been watching her. Her skin had the  glossiness of a caramel apple. Her figure reminded me of an apple, too,  but this was not a flaw because apples reminded me of pie, pie reminded  me of ice cream, and pie and ice cream made me hungry for&hellip;Maura.</p><p>I  didn&rsquo;t go hungry that fall semester, fortunately, but my appetite for  Maura confused those who thought she wasn&rsquo;t worth pursuing. A girl I&rsquo;d  once dated, the type who counted her croutons, asked me one day if I had  &ldquo;a thing for heavy women.&rdquo; I told her no, I had a thing for women who  enjoyed life. My old girlfriend seemed to find this threatening. She  realized, I think, that it&rsquo;s easier to keep off the weight than to keep  on the happiness.</p><p>The charm of a barefoot Cinderella is that her  beauty obeys no formula and therefore can sneak up on a man. When he  becomes aware of it, he feels like he&rsquo;s discovered a secret. And secrets  are always exciting.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>I once worked in an office with a woman whom none of my colleagues  seemed to know was there. Nor did I, at first. Her job was distributing  memos and other documents, and she drew no attention to herself as she  passed silently among the cubicles. A bulletin about changes in the  health plan would suddenly show up on my desk, and I&rsquo;d have no idea  who&rsquo;d brought it. The tooth fairy? The memo elf?</p><p>Then one day,  when the office was half-deserted due to an outbreak of the stomach flu,  she caught my eye while walking toward me down an empty hallway.  Straight hair, straight posture, straight in every way. Flat, too. And  wearing glasses. Yet she was provocative as hell, like a stripper who  was working under deep cover. She had a disciplined, stealthy sensuality  that seemed to whisper to me as she slipped by: &ldquo;What you see isn&rsquo;t  half of what you&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;</p><p>I set out to get it, whatever it was,  confident I would face little competition. While hanging around the  woman&rsquo;s desk one morning, waiting for her to get back from her rounds, I  spied another guy my age peeking at me over his computer. I detected  jealousy. When the woman returned, I kept an eye on him as I asked her a  stupid question about a memo concerning the corporate softball league  or something. Then another guy showed up with a story about a  malfunctioning copier. The woman excused herself and went off to help  him.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in line,&rdquo; said the guy at the computer.</p><p>The movie  was based on a novel I&rsquo;d written, Thumbsucker, about my agonizing  adolescence. The director invited me to suburban Oregon to spend a few  days on the set. There, I met the woman playing my mother: the  Oscar-winning British actress Tilda Swinton. She instructed me to call  her Tilda and invited me to her trailer for a chat.</p><p>She struck me  at first as less than stunning. Her skin was pale, as though sun had  never touched it; she was wearing a costume of homely nurse&rsquo;s scrubs;  and her short red hair was dyed a mousey brown. We sat across a small  table drinking coffee and talking about our love lives (I was going  through a divorce), and I couldn&rsquo;t believe how comfortable I was. Tilda  was a Hollywood leading lady&mdash;the first one I&rsquo;d ever been alone with. I  should have been too awestruck to lift my cup.</p><p>But the awe didn&rsquo;t  take long to set in. Fifteen minutes into the conversation, Tilda&rsquo;s  unorthodox glamour overwhelmed me. Her pallor turned luminous. And  because she lacked the curves and cleavage of the stereotypical female  star, there was nothing to distract me from her assured, refined  intelligence, which was the sexiest thing about her. In even her most  ordinary gestures&mdash;raising her coffee cup, patting her pockets to find a  ringing cell phone&mdash;there was a magnetic elegance. She moved the way  thought moves, with a quiet fluidity. Her beauty was pure, unobstructed,  metaphysical. But it had a physical effect. By the time the director  called Tilda onto the set, my head was swarming with inappropriate  fantasies whose moral saving grace was that they featured my movie  mother, not the woman who&rsquo;d given birth to me.</p><p>She&mdash;my actual  mother&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised by this encounter. She told me back  in high school that there was often an inverse relationship between a  woman&rsquo;s superficial luster and her power to entrance the deeper self.  But I was a teenager, stuck on cheerleaders, so I didn&rsquo;t believe her  right away. Then I went out with a few cheerleaders. And then, later on,  I went out with a model. She wasn&rsquo;t shallow or ignorant, this model,  but she wasn&rsquo;t stimulating, either. So smooth and uniform was her  exterior that she seemed to be encased in glass. The first time I saw  her naked, I was flummoxed. Where to focus? Where to start? I gazed at  her on the hotel mattress and searched for a scar&mdash;or a flaw of any sort  that might afford my lust a toehold. My attention kept losing its grip  and sliding away, though, so I ended up ordering chocolate mousse from  room service as a stalling tactic.</p><p>When the confection finally arrived, Cinderella was fast asleep, of course. And I&rsquo;d changed from a prince into a pumpkin.</p><p>To  me, it comes down to Los Angeles versus Paris. In L.A., where I&rsquo;ve  spent some time in recent years, a lot of the women have nothing wrong  with them&mdash;and nothing particularly right about them either. The outer  layers of skin they&rsquo;re constantly peeling and dermabrading must strip  away some of their inner selves as well. And who cares about eyelids so  tight and firm that they make the eyes beneath them look cyclops-wide  and triple-espresso awake? Whatever happened to sultry, sleepy  sensuality? As for implants, no matter where in the body they&rsquo;re  inserted, they lend a woman a faint cyborg aura. The polymers in them  must send out vibrations.</p><p>In Paris, which I first visited in my twenties, the situation is the opposite.</p><p>I  sat there dumbfounded at the small caf&eacute;, watching the street and  pretending to read Ulysses as the waiter delivered my third croissant.  The passing women weren&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d expected. An American pal at my grad  school back in England had warned me that Parisian femininity would  tempt me to relinquish my U.S. citizenship, and I&rsquo;d assumed that what  he&rsquo;d meant was that I&rsquo;d find myself surrounded by beauty queens with  magazine-cover faces and centerfold figures. The reality was quite  different, though. As the strolling women neared my table, what loomed  were their protruding noses, their conspicuous ears, their overly broad  shoulders. As they passed, I took note of their formidable posteriors,  their lack of any posteriors whatsoever, and their oddly squat or boyish  physiques. What lingered when they vanished, however, was their  heartbreaking seductiveness.</p><p>They came in all shapes and sizes,  these French ticklers, but rarely in the standard ones. The cut and  drape of their appearances was haute couture, not off-the-rack. Until I  saw them, I hadn&rsquo;t realized how many ways there are for women to be  themselves&mdash;their best and most enchanting selves. Nor had I known how  many parts of me could be aroused by such shows of self-acceptance. I&rsquo;d  been living in one dimension&mdash;on the surface of the TV screen, the  catalog page&mdash;but I&rsquo;d awakened deep inside the Louvre, with galleries  stretching away in every direction (including the one that houses the  Mona Lisa, who&rsquo;s no knockout herself but always draws a crowd).</p><p>Thank  you, Paris. Thank you, Tilda Swinton (humbly disguised as a midwestern  nurse). Thank you, sleeping model. Thank you, Maura. Together, you and  your ilk have granted men a power we&rsquo;ve longed for since we were  teenagers: the ability to see through clothes, not to mention layers of  foundation and coquettish posing, to the sexy center of a woman. You  taught us to walk into parties, bars, and offices and look around not  for pageant-winning figures, blown-glass complexions, and foreshortened  noses, but direct our gaze downward, at women&rsquo;s feet. Crooked toes? No  glass slippers? Promising.</p></div>"

"event","&nbsp;Well. Today was one of those days that is definitely listed under &quot;Weird Life Experiences.&quot; Today Mallory and I went to see a psychic. It was...fateful. We had just been talking about how we kind of&nbsp;weirdly&nbsp;wanted to do that at some point, but we would never spend more than, oh, I don't know, probably ten bucks on something so frivolous, and then there we were, driving through North Park, when we see a sign. Psychic Readings. Today Only: $10 Special. Well, there you go. So we went in. It was kind of a sketchy house (&quot;Just sketchy enough,&quot;&nbsp;Mallory&nbsp;said) and inside was a normal-looking, middle-aged woman with blondish hair and&nbsp;brown&nbsp;eyes and two small children playing Call Of Duty. Truly the stuff great stories are made of. I went first. She told me I wouls live a long life, 86-87 years, and a happy and healthy one. She said I was sensitive and easily hurt, but didn't like to show my feelings. She asked me what I did (&quot;I'm an assistant&quot;) and said I would not be in that line of work for long. She saw more school for me. A &nbsp;lot more. She assumed I had a guy in my life. I confirmed. She said to stay with him. She said I really care abut him and he really cares about me. She said someone is gossiping about me behind my back and it's not very nice. I'll find out about it. Don't let it bother me. My family and friends are coming between my guy and me, but don't let them. There will be changes in my living sitution. That's abot all I remember. More later."

"event","Becky and I are in the process of watching <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> right now and I am consequently super obsessed with the four elements at the moment. Last night I practically had myself convinced I was going to bend the water from the sink to wash my face so that I wouldn't have to do it myself. Yikes. But Becky is very earth and Tony is very fire. I am seeing this more and more.<br /><br />Tony: Should the fire turn to dark, take my heart  with you.<br /><br />More later."

You would be true? 
Would I love you
More than I do?

I don't think so,
My love can't grow
Because I know
You'll never go.

You may believe
That I'm naive,
I can't conceive
That you would leave,

But in your eyes,
You can't disguise
That I'd surprise
You with goodbyes.

[something re: how i can make such a claim - faith]

And so, my dear,
If you should fear
These words you hear
Are insincere,

Remember who
Sang them to you

I'll sing your song again"

Lyric obsession of the day:
&quot;Oh, the sirens sang so sweet and watched the sailors going down.
Oh, you talked to me in siren song, yeah, anyone would drown.&quot;

Also, I got my hair cut! Exciting, but scary. I mean, I really like it, but I miss my long hair already. It'll grow back, I know, but it's still hard to let go.

BEYOND excited to go home this weekend. I need a break from school, from Tucson, from the dorm, from my friends. I love them, but I need to see my mommy and my real-life friends for a little while."

It was held in a decked-out airline hangar, and everything, from the stunning cocktail waitresses to the champagne fountain, was over-the-top. But even in the midst of all that glitz, Tessa was the main attraction. She was a slender, vibrant redhead in a bright orange dress&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t miss her. After a few minutes of sneaking nervous glances in her direction, I got up the guts to approach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing my favorite color,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I like orange because it rhymes with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she finished. The spark was undeniable. Tessa was smart&mdash;an investment banker&mdash;and had a great laugh. Somehow, she was still single. When she casually slipped me her card at the end of the night, I was ecstatic.</p>  <p>On our date the following week, things got even better. Tessa wore a clingy black dress, and over dinner she lit up with stories of four-million-a-minute losses in the futures market. Sexy. When she asked me back to her place after the check came, I couldn&rsquo;t say yes fast enough. Soon, as we stood in her hallway, groping each other like teenagers, my hand fumbled to her chest, anticipating the plush, nurturing flesh of her&hellip;</p>  <p>Wait a minute. Was her breast rippled? As I felt the telltale implant bag under her skin, I thought, Damn it&mdash;fake boobs. My mind overflowed with images of hospitals and scalpels. I froze up, and Tessa noticed.</p>  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting weird,&rdquo; she said.</p>  <p>&ldquo;I am not. I mean, maybe I am. It&rsquo;s just, um, are these, uh,&rdquo; I stammered, still sheepishly groping at her chest.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Are you frisking me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>  <p>I stammered on.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; she said.</p>  <p>Before I knew what had hit me, I was back in my car, driving away from the first woman who&rsquo;d sparked my interest in months. What just happened? Was I really going to let plastic surgery get in the way of my search for love&mdash;again?</p>  <p>That&rsquo;s right. Tessa wasn&rsquo;t the first surgically enhanced woman I&rsquo;d dated, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. Let me explain: I&rsquo;m an actor in my thirties, and I live in Los Angeles, a town that seems overrun with silicone. Before I met Tessa I&rsquo;d already dated women with nose jobs, huge breast enhancements and lips plumped to bee-stung proportions. With each of these women, I&rsquo;d tell myself that what they did with their bodies was their choice, that it wasn&rsquo;t my place to judge. But then questions would fill my head: Is this woman really who she seems to be? Am I dating the person or the persona? Inevitably my attraction to them floundered, and the relationship did too. I had, it seemed, a real issue with all the nipping and tucking going on in the dating world. And this wasn&rsquo;t just an L.A. phenomenon either&mdash;I have college friends who&rsquo;ve noticed the same trend in America&rsquo;s heartland. In 2006, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there were nearly 11 million cosmetic procedures in the U.S.&mdash;that&rsquo;s nearly a 50 percent increase from 2000.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class=""article-text""><p>Certainly, men are partially responsible for this trend. We can be superficial creatures: abandoning faithful life partners for younger, prettier versions, TiVo-ing Skinemax movies and wondering why we, mere mortals, aren&rsquo;t married to the likes of Jenna Jameson. But as much as we lust after images of hyper-real beauty in the <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit issue or even in the apartments or cubicles next door, we don&rsquo;t quite know how to react when those unreal bodies actually belong to the woman in our lives.</p>  <p>Was surgery something I could handle? Or was it time to start looking for a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; woman, &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; and all? It would take me three more relationships and a handful of blunders to figure that out&mdash;starting with Mia&hellip;.</p>  <h3>No secrets, except surgical ones</h3>  <p>I met Mia soon after the Tessa &ldquo;frisking&rdquo; incident, and I was relieved that all of her looked and felt natural. She was pretty and feisty, cracking me up with stories about her two schnauzers with rhyming names. Within weeks of meeting, we were an item, taking weekend trips and storing toothbrushes at each other&rsquo;s apartments. So imagine my surprise when, during a rainy day many months later, Mia decided to show me an old photo album&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t recognize anyone in the pictures. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>  <p>Silence.</p>  <p>Finally, she laughed nervously and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right there, silly.&rdquo; I looked closer.</p>  <p>Same hair, same smile, but when I finally focused between her eyes, I blurted, &ldquo;You had a nose job?!&rdquo;</p>  <p>I was baffled, and more than a little hurt. We&rsquo;d been dating for almost a year. She&rsquo;d trusted me enough to tell me about losing her virginity and her secret dreams of moving to Spain, so why hadn&rsquo;t she trusted me enough to tell me about her surgery? She made light of it, and insisted there was nothing to talk about, but I couldn&rsquo;t let it go. It seemed dishonest. A lie by omission, surely&mdash;but also a lost opportunity for intimacy. Why had she gotten the nose job? How did it feel before and after? These were things I wanted to know. And once I realized she didn&rsquo;t feel the need to share them with me, the trust between us was gone. Our relationship ended pretty quickly after that.</p>  <h3>Trying to see past the nips and tucks</h3>  <p>Not long after things went south with Mia, I met an ad executive who was elegant and quirky (one of my favorite combinations) and whose proportions seemed perfectly normal. I asked her to dinner, and we met a few weeks later at a Japanese restaurant. But something was different about her that night. As she nibbled at a bowl of edamame, I figured it out: Her lower lip seemed much fuller than it was the first time we&rsquo;d met&mdash;it looked like the mouths of actresses I&rsquo;d worked with who&rsquo;d gotten collagen and talked about it openly. And since those actresses were so comfortable discussing it, I felt comfortable asking the ad exec, &ldquo;When&rsquo;d you get your work done?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p><div class=""article-text""><p>&ldquo;Work done?&rdquo; she shot back. &ldquo;Who do you think I am, a stripper?&rdquo; I was beginning to get the picture: Women might chat about their surgery&mdash;or adventures at the dermatologist&rsquo;s office&mdash;with near strangers, but the new guy they&rsquo;re dating is probably the last person they feel like sharing with. If I wanted to know whether my date still had all her God-given parts, I needed to figure it out from visual cues alone. When it came to implants, if the boobs were pert with no bra: fake. If they were too rounded on top: fake. Needless to say, my obsession with all of this became a topic of great amusement for my coupled friends. &ldquo;What was it this time, Gabe?&rdquo; they&rsquo;d ask when we gathered for dinner.</p>  <p>Then I met Callie, who didn&rsquo;t make me guess. She singled me out at a friend&rsquo;s birthday party, regaling me with childhood stories, most of which involved some sort of brawl. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Callie suddenly said, &ldquo;these fake boobs are so not me.&rdquo; This was a change: I&rsquo;d hardly had time to notice her breasts&mdash;all my attempts to check her out discreetly had been foiled by her gaze, and she was already revealing that they weren&rsquo;t real. Her forthrightness was a breath of fresh air, and I felt comfortable asking why she&rsquo;d gotten fake boobs in the first place&mdash; if they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;her&rdquo;? It turned out a former boyfriend had woken her up one morning with a very romantic question: &ldquo;Hey, you ever think about getting better tits?&rdquo; Callie loved this guy, and after a series of failed relationships, she wanted to please him, so she went out and bought big, D-cup implants a few months later. Unsurprisingly, they broke up soon after that, and Callie was left with a very strange relationship souvenir. Some girls have tattoos of old lovers&rsquo; names; Callie had an $8,000 pair of breasts.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;d started to really like Callie. And as we talked about the problems her implants caused for her&mdash;the way people took her less seriously at work, the unsettling way she no longer recognized herself in the mirror&mdash;I came to a realization about why I was so wary of women with plastic surgery. As far as I could tell, almost all the women I&rsquo;d met who had changed their bodies through surgery had either done it to bandage some adolescent body issue or to make themselves more attractive to men. I didn&rsquo;t like that&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t seem like a celebration of beauty, but a scrambling attempt to fix something. What I wanted was to be with a woman who worshiped herself as much as I worshiped her. I mean, come on, this is the female form here, the most beautiful thing on earth. To me, surgery somehow implied a lack of confidence. It was as if something purchased to say, &ldquo;Hey, check me out,&rdquo; actually said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like myself very much.&rdquo; I knew that in some ways, this was a ridiculous generalization. Women get surgery for all kinds of reasons. Who was I to decide that every person with a chiseled nose also came with psychological baggage? But I couldn&rsquo;t help it; that&rsquo;s how I felt.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class=""article-text""><p>When I explained this theory to Callie, she said she understood. In fact, she told me, she&rsquo;d decided to get her implants removed. Great, I thought. Callie would get back her real body, and I would get a girlfriend with natural breasts. But part of her transformation, apparently, included cutting me out of her life. I&rsquo;ll never know exactly why she disappeared without a word after her surgery, but I have a feeling she wanted to rethink her relationships with men&mdash;what they wanted from her, and what she was willing to do for them. I have to admit, I understand. And looking back now, I can appreciate what she taught me: that choosing to have surgery doesn&rsquo;t make you a dishonest person.</p>  <h3>Understanding what I really needed</h3>  <p>After that, determined to change my dating luck, I tried looking for women outside of my Hollywood circle&mdash;at the gym, at the grocery story, even at the library. That&rsquo;s where I met Kara. Kara was a novelist from New York who looked lean and fit and, best of all, completely real, in jeans and a T-shirt. When I thought about getting my hands on her au naturel parts, my mind reeled. During our second make-out session, she stopped me as my hands slipped under her shirt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too excited,&rdquo; she joked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re awful.&rdquo; Were they? Well, one was noticeably larger than the other, and they didn&rsquo;t look like breasts I was used to seeing on lingerie billboards, but I loved that they were&hellip;hers. Kara turned out to be one of the great loves of my life. We dated long distance until the lack of regular contact drove us apart. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;m still not over her.</p>  <p>In fact Kara (and her gorgeously imperfect body) helped me figure out that dating women who&rsquo;d been under the knife would probably never feel right to me. There are a thousand enhanced goddesses out there who will one day make other men very happy. I know those women are worth dating, and I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with a handful of them myself. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the woman for me will deal with her physical peccadilloes with humor and self-acceptance, not surgery.</p>  <p>This is the part I think women don&rsquo;t understand. When a guy falls in love, his lover&rsquo;s body parts become bewitching. I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that our heads don&rsquo;t turn when we see a stacked blond walking down the street. But when we fall for you&mdash;really, really fall for you&mdash;you hijack our sense of beautiful. What&rsquo;s sexy to us? You&mdash;in the &ldquo;before&rdquo; picture.</p>  <p>*Names and identifying details have been changed.</p>  <p><em>Gabriel Olds has appeared on </em>CSI, Law &amp; Order: SVU and Six Feet Under. <em>He&rsquo;s usually the bad guy (on TV). His most recent film is</em> Life of the Party.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>"

Ben L: a bird shat in my hair as i left campus, so i had to go take a shower. i know, right? leave it at will call, i'll be a few minutes late. (He's Just Not That Into You)

Mallory: Moses Hogan! Lawdy!

Me: Oh my god. It's snowing.
Jack: <3 love is alive <3

Ben L: ohmygod. i finally won't feel bad about texting so early and possibly waking you up. i took a nap at four yesterday, setting alarms for around five, just for a short naap. but my phone was on silent. WTF?! noooooo! i woke up at seven this morning, and thought it was seven at night, and i was getting ready for ballroom and homework. it wasn't until i got out of the shower that i realized it was seven in the MORNING. this is a hilarious tragedy.
Ben L: btw, i was in the middle of texting you at like 7:30 with 'wtf are you talking about, ballroom doesn't start for an hour!' and then the realization hit as i questioned why it was kind of light outside. and it snowed?! dammit!

Me: blor blor choir concert blor.
Mallory: blor blor blor college blor."

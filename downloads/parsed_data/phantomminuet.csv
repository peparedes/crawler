"event","I am always the one who says the blessing at family dinners on holidays.  This is the blessing I used today.  From the Book of Common Prayer:

Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have
done for us. We thank you for the splendor of the whole
creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life,
and for the mystery of love.

We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for
the loving care which surrounds us on every side.

We thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best
efforts, and for leading us to accomplishments which satisfy
and delight us.

We thank you also for those disappointments and failures
that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.

Above all, we thank you for your Son Jesus Christ; for the
truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast
obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,
through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life
again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.

Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and
make him known; and through him, at all times and in all
places, may give thanks to you in all things. Amen."

"event","One of our grant employees is leaving, and I was asked by the exec to pull together something for her send-off.  True to form, the exec didn't ask until September 16, and her last day is September 23, but I have a can-do attitude and email, so it went off pretty well.  I organized a Taqueria for lunch and ordered a cake, and a good time was had by all.

Saturday night, I had a weird, unsettling dream about my brother, which involved the extended family, a $16,000 theft from his work van, and a punch to the face, resulting in a lost tooth.  So, yesterday, I texted my brother to say that I had a weird dream about him, and I was just checking to see if he was all right.  He texted back to say that he's at the beach with his girlfriend.

So he's fine.  :-)"

Knoxville had an afternoon movie showcase called The Early Show, and my brother and I got home from school in time to watch the movie on it. They were kid-friendly movies about pirates, cowboys, giant atomic monsters, and, of course, Tarzan."

"event","So I stopped by the Dunkin' Donuts on the way to work to buy a dozen donuts and a bag of coffee, because I like DD's coffee.  There's a pound bag of decaf coffee sitting in a wire rack by the cash register, and I've bought bagged coffee there many times before, so I ordered a dozen donuts, and I point to the bag of coffee, asking if they have the French vanilla or hazelnut flavors.  The girl at the register says no, so I tell her to just give me a pound of the original blend.  I pay for it, she selects my dozen donuts, and hands me the box.  I say that I'm supposed to get a pound of coffee, too.  She smiles and nods and moves on to the next customer.

So I go to the end of the counter and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Finally, I lean across the counter and say, ""Can someone just hand me my pound of coffee?"" Another employee looks at me and says, ""We don't sell bagged coffee.""

WTF?  

I get a refund, but where was I unclear in this whole transaction that I was buying a pound of coffee?  <i>In</i> a bag.  Because how else can you buy a pound of coffee?"

"event","It seems that I don't often like book series with primary female protagonists, especially in urban fantasy.  I do like a strong secondary female protagonist or female partner, but I find myself following more series that have primary male protagonists, like Harry Dresden, Felix Castor, Cal Leandros, Whyborne and Griffin (my new bright and shiny), etc.  I do read books with female protagonists and enjoy them--Tanya Huff's books come to mind--but I find my frustration threshold with female protagonists is a lot lower than with male protagonists.  Part of that is because I loathe stupid women characters.  Loathe them.  If the protagonist is careless or reckless or unprepared or willfully ignorant, thereby creating her own problems, then I tire of her very quickly, whether it's in a book, on a TV show, or in a movie.

So dazzle me, flist.  Recommend a series with a strong female protagonist who isn't going to piss me off on a regular basis.  And before you start, not Patricia Briggs, Laurell K. Hamilton, Charlaine Harris, Kim Harrison, Kelley Armstrong, Rachel Caine, L.A. Banks, or Mary Janice Davidson.  Started reading them all, grew bored, and stopped.  I have started Elona Andrews' Kate Daniels series and Kat Richardson's Greywalker series, and I may yet go back and finish them, but I've put them aside for now. I've also just started Seanan Maguire's October Days series, but it hasn't pulled me in yet. 

Examples of female protagonists whom I absolutely loved:

Vicki Nelson, Torin Kerr, Claire Hansen (Tanya Huff)
Alexia Tarabotti (Gail Carriger)
Jani Killian (Kristine Smith)
Tinker Bell (Wen Spencer)
Adelia Aguilar (Arianna Franklin)(not really urban fantasy, but such a good series)

I don't like whiners.  I don't like dumbasses.  I don't like sloppy world building. I don't like romance/sex scenes that screw up a good story. And if it must have graphic sex scenes, I prefer more foreplay and afterglow, with less detailed trajectory of bodily fluids and the like.

Ready.  Set. Go."

"event","So I went to the funeral on Friday in Memphis. The funeral was at a black church, and I was one of only about three white people present.  After the funeral, which was very nice and had a great sermon on Donald Chump, er, Trump and dual citizenship--black pastors don't shy away from politics in their sermons--I went up to hug Forestine and talk to her, because I hadn't arrived in Memphis in time to attend the receiving of friends before the service.

Apparently, her sister saw us hugging and talking, and she asked Forestine later, ""Who was that white girl with the short hair?""  And Forestine said, ""I work with her.  She's my sister from another mother.""  So now, Forestine's sister has taken to asking about me and calling me ""our sister from another mother"".  :-)"

On the way back home, we stopped and bought some of the most beautiful peaches you have ever seen from Isom Orchards.  They are luscious.  And there's nothing you can do to a ripe peach that will make it any better than it already exists in nature.  Apples are enhanced by cinnamon, bananas by butter and brown sugar, pears by poaching in wine, but a ripe peach is perfect.

Sunday, I went to church wearing a fluttery, light-weight pink/black/white trapeze dress, black flats, and a black sinamay hat, because it was HOT.  Then I spent the rest of the day in my air-conditioned house, reading the book for sci fi book group tonight and eating peaches."

"event","I was going to sit on the porch and read, but there's no breeze, so it's still too hot.  So I'm staying inside my nice cool house and reading gay mysteries.  The replacement windows that I got last fall are doing a great job keeping the house cool.

I ushered at church this morning, and several people complimented my hat.  It is the bishop's favorite...a white translucent lampshade hat with feather fronds.  I was pretty summery all over today... white fluttery ankle-length skirt, royal blue sleeveless top, yellow sandals, yellow purse, white hat, sterling and pearl rings, Pandora bracelet, sterling pendants.

I got a CD stuck in my car stereo, and I've taken it to two places that couldn't get it out.  This means that I can't listen to my books on CD, so I've been reduced to pulling out my Kindle, hooking it up to the auxiliary port in my dash, and listening to Audible books that I bought months ago.  This has worked out excessively well.  I've listened to the last Mistress of the Art of Death book (so sad that there will be no more), and the first two of Josh Lanyon's Holmes and Moriarity gay mystery-romance series.  I love Lanyon's books.  I previously listened to his Adrian English series and read several of his stand-alone stories.  He has a good ear for dialogue and his sex scenes are incredibly well done.

With all the great produce available, I have started cooking and eating healthy food again. I am going to make small changes every week to improve my eating habits.  First change, which goes into effect this week, is no soda at home--only water, tea, and milk.  Next week, I'll add no soda at work.

Ciao for now, bellas."

Since this past week was the Royal Ascot, I wore one of my fascinators to church on Sunday.  It's black with a little iridescent green in it, and it looks like a sea urchin perched on the side of my head.  I do love it so.  I wore it with a black/white polka dot dress and simple silver jewelry, that wouldn't detract from the fascinator.

Hurrah!

I spent my past weekend doing all the little tasks that I've put off for months--binge-watch two seasons of ""Arrow"", have new batteries put in my watches, drop off my winter cleaning, take suit pants to the tailor for hemming, de-clutter my book collection, get the info to renew my passport, apply for a library card, have my hair cut, downsize my wardrobe to create a capsule wardrobe to last into the summer and early fall, etc.  I felt very accomplished.  

Now, I just need to deliver the sacks of clothes and boxes of books to the appropriate locations.  Which will be my project for this next weekend, along with cleaning off my patio.

My capsule wardrobe is primarily black, navy blue, and white/cream, with splashes of pink, yellow, and aqua.  To that end, I wore a navy and white dress on Sunday with a big Holly Golightly-esque navy hat, a yellow handbag, a large vintage yellow enamel flower pin, blue sandals, and amber/sterling jewelry."

"event","...but I forgot all the other stuff I had to do...book group on Saturday night, finish reading book before book group on Saturday night, church service, reception for our assistant music director (he's leaving us to become a music director at another church) after church, Church in the Yard after the reception, and Foyer Group after Church in the Yard. Unfortunately, I was so tired, sweaty, and smelly after Church in the Yard that I wimped out on Foyer Group, which involved a picnic and live music at a local winery in 90+ degree weather.

I don't really regret missing it.  ;-)

We had a huge number of homeless for Church in the Yard (probably wanting to get in out of the heat, as much as eat), and I spent an hour and a half bent over filling cups of iced tea from a spout on a big cooler, and, boy, can I feel it today.  I need to do a lot of strengthening of my abdominal and back muscles.  I have a standing desk for my computer at work (at which I am standing right now), and I have started using the stairs at work, instead of the elevator.  I have also started my own little weight loss group at work to keep me honest for DragonCon, and I hope to get a walking group started.

But not today.  Today, we had lightning, thunder, torrential rain, flash floods, and hail.  =:-o

Despite my excessive weight, I was a vision at church yesterday.  I have a very odd, showy hat that is an asymmetrical white straw pillbox with a profusion of black/white marabou feathers exploding out of the crown. The feathers move constantly, even when I'm still.  I don't wear it often, because it's such a distracting hat, but the Episcopalians love it.  Along with my fabulous hat, I wore a black/white sleeveless dress with a fitted waist, a knee length full skirt, and a vertically oriented print.  Arlene, our resident textile artist, said the ensemble looked like my dress had deconstructed and come streaming out of the top of my hat.

She's pretty whimsical, is our Arlene. 

I carried a black fringed shawl, because the church is cold in the draughty spots, and to add a punch of color, I wore yellow fisherman sandals and carried a bright yellow leather purse.  I looked pretty put together, if I do say so myself.  >>(:-)  Fortunately, I had my walking clothes and shoes in my car, so I was able to change before Church in the Yard.

I'm still at the office, killing time and waiting for the rain and the rain-maddened traffic to clear, before I go home.  I'm in the middle of binge-watching the first season of Arrow, and while I have not fallen in love with this show the way I did in binge-watching the first season of Supernatural, it's good enough to keep me watching.

Animal lovers, avert your eyes.  

Okay, but you've been warned.  My neighbors have been feeding the feral cats in the neighborhood for years.  I have asked them to fix the females, after one of them had a litter in my crawlspace a couple of years ago, but they didn't do it. Over time, the numbers have ranged from 4 to 14 cats (the most recent total)

The cats poop in any bare space in my yard, spray my porch, and get up under my car.  I have to spread orange peels on my porch and in my yard to try to keep them away, and it looks awful. Then, about a week ago, I saw a cat sitting by my crawlspace entrance, which I thought was blocked.  But when  I took a step toward the cat, she ducked through a little opening into the crawl space.

Well, I wasn't having that, so I called a company to come and catch her.  Before they were done, they had caught 5 adult males and pulled 7 kittens from two different litters from my crawlspace.  The two females were outside the crawlspace when he set the traps, and so he didn't catch them in the five days the traps were there, but I was already $1000 into the process, so I had the workman block up the entrance.  

Unfortunately, I am not done.  Not only do I have to have someone rebuild the crawlspace door, it is probably going to cost $3-4000 to have my crawlspace remediated, and the vapor barrier replaced.

And now I have to have a really awkward conversation with my neighbors, because I cannot tolerate this situation any longer."

"event","ON Friday, I started to see these lightning flashes in the periphery of my right eye, and I had a huge floater in that same eye.  Now, I have had floaters for years, but the flashes were new.  I, naturally, went to the internet and read up on flashes and floaters.  The first article didn't seem so bad, so I decided to see what happened over the weekend, since it was already too late to get an appointment with my eye doctor.

The flashes lessened over the weekend, but neither the flashes nor the floater went away, so I went to the internet and read some more on flashes and floaters and pretty much scared the crap out of myself that I had a torn or detached retina.  So I called my eye doctor, and he worked me in today.  He dilated the bejesus out of my eyes.  It took nearly 7 hours for them to return to normal.  But he didn't find any evidence of a tear or detachment of my retina, so Yay!  I, apparently, just have aging eyes, and the vitreous fluid is pulling away from the retina, which causes the flashes, so Boo!  

This is, as my doctor put it, my ""new normal"".  I have a follow-up visit in three weeks, just in case he missed something. 

In other news, I was snarky in an email to the exec yesterday, because I had a last minute event sprung on me, so my supervisor came over today and said, ""I need to talk to you about your email.""  I explained the situation, and then I asked if I should send an apology email.  He said yes, so I did.  The exec came by later and said that she was not aware that I hadn't been personally notified of the event, or that the event had not been placed on either the calendar or the master list on the X drive, as it was supposed to be.  So she expressed her understanding of my frustration, and we hugged it out.

I didn't post on Sunday, but here's my outfit:

Black trousers
Black short-sleeved turtleneck
Pink/burgundy/black/white jacket
Black wool felt hat with an asymmetrical brim and netting embellishment (bought at Lilliput in Toronto)

Black suede/patent leather shoes (Vaneli)

Tonight, I'm going to either clean out the refrigerator or cull my book collection.  I haven't decided.  Whichever one I don't do tonight, I will do tomorrow, along with going through my kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.

In other news, I got a big tax refund this year.  Well, big for me.  It was over $3500, of which at least $2000 is going toward what I still owe on the new energy efficient windows that I had installed last fall and which have been working like a charm during all this bitterly cold weather.  The other $1500 is going toward paying off a small credit card, buying my DragonCon membership, paying for my Steeplechase tickets, and funding part of my April trip to the Outer Banks with Karen.

I must have looked at my watch, because she smiles and says, ""It's next week."" And she was right.  I mistakenly thought this weekend was the time change, and I had already turned all my clocks forward.

After church, I went over to Holy Trinity to help feed the homeless. We had a bunch of people and served a lot of food.  I had made two pans of rocky road brownies and two cakes of corn bread to contribute to the other bread and dessert we had, as well as bringing eight dozen miniature moon pies in chocolate and banana.  They're individually wrapped, so the homeless folks can tuck one or two in their pockets and take a treat with them.  I did the same thing with leftover Halloween candy in November and sale Christmas chocolate in January, and they really seemed to like it.

From there, I went to bell practice with the Baptists.  The choir director has resigned, so the bell choir director has decided that we will ring on Palm Sunday, rather than Easter Sunday. This is a great relief to me, because I want to be at my church on Easter Sunday, and because it will be my church's turn to feed the homeless again.  We've been talking about doing something special.  I think we should bake several hams and have ham, potatoes, and vegetables with coconut Easter bunny cakes (they're easy to make), but we haven't really decided yet.

Since we were feeding the homeless, I didn't dress all that formally for church, but here goes.

The temp never got above the upper 30's.  There was still ice everywhere. He even got one of the Penske moving trucks stuck in ice at one point.  Everything took twice as long to do.  Mike, Royce, and I arrived with the moving trucks and his loaded jeep (which I was driving) to the new house in Lawrenceburg, and it was too dark to unload.  So we parked the trucks, changed into dry clothes, and went to eat our collective weight in fried catfish, hush puppies, and onion rings, because we worked right through lunch.

Mike drove Royce and me back to Nashville, and I insisted that Mike come stay the night at my house, because his apartment was empty and dusty, and he would have had to sleep on an inflatable mattress.  So he came over, we drank a bottle of Prosecco, and I crashed.  He was up and dressed before me and was anxious to get going, so I made sausage, scrambled three eggs, sliced two tomatoes, and peeled an orange into sections for breakfast, because that's all the breakfast food I had.  I don't eat eggs, so Mike ate all the scrambled eggs, and Mike doesn't eat tomatoes or oranges, apparently, so I ended up eating them.

I'm walking wounded, because I tripped over the vacuum cleaner in the junk room yesterday morning and fell, hitting the big trunk, a vintage chair, and the ironing board on the way down. Fortunately, hitting all these objects slowed me down, so I didn't hit the floor that hard. Unfortunately, I hit my sore toe, which is now sorer (is that a word?) and turning an odd color.  I also strained my neck and back, but not badly.  They're just a little sore today.  My upper left arm, however, is very sore, so I think that's the part of me that hit the chest.

Moral of the story:  Clean out the junk room.

I had this weird dream last night. I was home visiting my parents, and they were still living in the Emory Road house (which they moved out of over 10 years ago). While in my old blue bedroom, I discovered a cache of expensive hats in my closet that I had never worn. They still had the tags on them. I was debating wearing one of them for Easter, but I couldn't decide, because my hair kept changing length, and I couldn't tell how the hat was going to look, when I stood in front of the mirror.

Moral of this story: I need a haircut.

I have new electronics.  My employer bought me a Surface Pro 2, apparently so that I can work 24/7.  :-\  But I can't complain.  I've been bitching about the fact that the attorneys aren't provided with laptops for years, when all the field staff have had laptops for more than a decade.  I have named it Merlin, in keeping with my tradition of naming all of my computers after wizards or wizard companions.  Now I have to familiarize myself with a new set of icons, procedures, and tiny fonts.

Moral of the story:  Be careful what you wish for.

And finally, Jason Momoa as Aquaman.

"event","The Mid-State got an inch to an inch and a half of ice yesterday. Monday was a holiday, so it was easy to stay home, but the mayor asked everyone who could to stay home on Tuesday, because everything refroze last night, so my office is officially closed today.

I've caught up my washing, cleaned up from my party this weekend, changed my sheets, and tidied the house.  I'm going to break out the sourdough starter later and bake some bread."

"event","I am wearing a tall vintage Mr. John Elite Furs toque in gray and white Tuscan lamb.  It is lined with a yellow damask fabric.

I do not buy new fur, as a rule, but I do occasionally wear repurposed or vintage fur.  It's a compromise, sure, but I figure that I'm not creating a demand for new fur, which is the ultimate goal.  Plus, I wear a lot of leather, so why be a hypocrite?"

I am no stranger to evil, but this is far beyond any torture even I could inflict. The ghostly apparitions walk the hallways, placid, faint expressions plastered on their transparent faces. I force myself not to run to them, to attempt to embrace the, for id I do, they go up in smoke, and I can hear faint cold laughter.

I cannot fly here, the ceilings are too low, and I cannot go outside. My wings ache from lack of use. 

I do nopt know how long I have been here. Hour melts into hour melts into hour. The clock on the wall has no hands. The blank face and dark numbers stare at me, mocking.

Oh I must escape this monotony, before I go mad.

Please, Vladislaus, Master, if you can read this...hurry.

I mourned my father for almost a year, but I eventually began to get on with my life. Around October, I was invited to a masqued ball, not far from my own home. 

I attended, glad to get away from my grief.

And, of course, I had barelled straight into the arms of the Count again. 

I accepted his invatation to stay with him at his palace for the week-end, but I ended up staying nearly a month. 

And then he told me he was a vampire. I panicked, fled, and did not see him for nearly half a year.

I finally came to terms with myself. I loved him, and I was not frightened of him, undead or not, and I returned to him.

And that, my dears, is simply it."

And as I have promised, I suppose I shall tell you about my life.

I came to Transylvania with my father. He was a well-to-do scholar and had been called upon by the monks who had settled in the Carpathians to translate biblical texts from Romanian into French and Italian. 

He worked in an enormous library that has long since been demolished, and I was basically raised there. I read, as I had nothing else to do. No siblings, no mother, no friends and nowhere to go besides that huge, bustling library and our home. 

So I found company in books. Anything I could comprehend I read. 

And I met the count when I was merely nineteen.

About six years later did he begin to show any form of interest in me at all. 

That October was a cold one, and my father, used to the warm weather of our native Italy, died on the first day December. I mourned the death of not only my father but my only friend.

I stayed late beside his coffin (it was to be buried the following dawn) and saw the count. 

We spoke for many hours, until he melted away into the shadows, and the morning dawned within minutes of his departure.

I shall write more later. This silence is driving me mad..."

But the subject of this entry is Dwergi. Vile, disgusting creatures! I have taken quite a liking to one small study, up, in the talles spire of the palace. I came there today, to write, and what has happened to it? My lords little sadistic oompah-loompahs had turned it into an eatery! Books and papers scattered everywhere, and they had a fire built there, and were roasting some form of animal over it, jabbering away in their wierd language. I screamed at them to get out, and they did, but everything is ruined. THEY BURNED MY BOOKS FOR THEIR FIRE! Now the entire room smells of burnt sheep...

I have said that Vladislaus should pick more...elegant assistants, but he insists upon these horrid hairy midgets! My only consolation is this journal, as my master is not here.

"event","Finally, we have recieved word that perhaps my master will join us at the Summer Palace, but for now he has buisness to attend to. But that has made both Aleera and Marishka exicted and wild. And now, I have the most exquisite headache. I retire to one of the many studies of the palace to write this. 
I have a sneaking suspicion one of my fellow brides is reading this. But I will spill my stories of today anyway, let them be mad at me. See what I care.
A messenger arrived with the news you see above. I attempted to recieve the message without the knowledge of Aleera and Marishka, but they barreled down the steps to listen. When he told us, they broke into annoying-high pitched shrieks and idiotic little dances of joy. Duty called, so I concealed my joy. As I said yesterday, they act like such children. What the count sees in them, I can't imagine. Although they have absolutely no idea when he comes, they run about, making reperations. I can't stand it! So here I am. And my head throbs, so I must depart.

"event","Ah. I must say it is my nature as a female, though several hundred years old, to enjoy buying clothing. We took a trip to the summer palace in Budapest, as the frigid Castle Dracula became boring for the three of us, and, to my eternal shame, we complained endlessly until my master let us leave. Upon our arrival Marishka suggested scouting the local stores. I had more fun than expected. Normally I let Aleera and Marishka do what they will, flirt with mortal men and buy extravagant items of apparel, but they made me join them. I managed to find a suitable tailor who produced the most fabulous dresses. We purchased several items of evening-wear and everyday dresses. I do dearly hope the count joins us. He seems very lonely these days. I believe a trip out to Budapest would do him good. The girls have been begging for another masquerade ball as well. Sometimes they act like such children."

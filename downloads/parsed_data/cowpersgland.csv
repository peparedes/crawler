I pleaded with him and told him how bad I had to pee.

"event","Worry about your hair, about your chipped fingernail. Worry about getting laid and smelling nice. Worry about getting paid enough to get high. Our concerns all self-centered, as is expected. We would not be here if we did not exist. But, remember, while you are checking for specks of food particles in your teeth, some are fighting cancer and AIDS, giving every last particle of energy as a fight, a protest. They're fighting with all they have, while our world ends when the boy of the month breaks it off. 
What does this say about us?"

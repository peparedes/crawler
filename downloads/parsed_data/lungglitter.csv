You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're
probably an intellectual, but don't take that to mean pretentious. You
realize 'dumb' can be witty--after all isn't that the Simpsons'
philosophy?--but rudeness for its own sake, 'gross-out' humor and most
other things found in a fraternity leave you totally flat. <br><br>I  guess you just have a more cerebral approach than most. You have the perfect mindset for a joke writer or staff  writer.<br><br>Your sense of humor takes the most thought to appreciate, but it's also the best, in my opinion.

"event","I'm sneaking onto LJ...dunno why, probably because I don't want to work but I want to present the impression that I'm working.  The clickity clack of the keys makes me sound professional or something.

Anyway, things are good.  We're getting into my FAVORITE time of year, which is early fall.  I love when it's cool outside but the sun is warm, and when things aren't dead yet but the leaves are just starting to turn.  I love a little decay.  :)

Here's the quiz that I was tagged for:


The top 6 songs I'm ""digging"" right now.

1. ""The District Sleeps Alone,"" The Postal Service
For obvious reasons, but it's also fun and techno and one of the stronger Postal Service songs, I think.  It also reminds me of being in China, and singing with Daniel Brown down in the dorm bar (a bar!  in a dorm!) in Beijing.
http://www.dcfc-tour.net/songs/districtsleeps.htm

2. ""Carrying Cathy,"" Ben Folds Five
I started to dig this song in the spring three-week, and it's still so good.  It's sad and beautiful and kind of hopeful, in a weird warped way.  And I love the symbolism/reality of ""carrying"" Cathy.
http://info.benfolds.org/CarryingCathyLyrics

3. ""Maggie May,"" Rod Stewart
If you know about my lesbian mamas, you know why this song has been on my playlist.  Additionally, it's just an awesome song.
http://www.bluesforpeace.com/lyrics/maggie-may.htm

4. ""Blood Roses,"" Tori Amos
I'm starting to get Tori burnout, and this is one of the Tori songs that just never gets old.  I love her work with harpsichord, and the lyrics are fabulous.
http://www.yessaid.com/lyrics/bloodroses.html

5. ""Eleanor Rigby,"" The Beatles
This has always been my favorite Beatles song.  It's really dark and the strings are wonderful.
http://home.att.net/~chuckayoub/Eleanor_Rigby_Lyrics.html

6. ""Dairy Queen,"" Indigo Girls
I read a review of this that said it was an ""unusually upbeat breakup song.""  I think that's accurate.  It also has a lot of focus on the singers instead of their instruments, and I like that.

I guess here is as good of a place as any to make the formal announcement that I've been hired!

I'm going to be working with AmeriCorps VISTA for the next year, at the Points of Light foundation in Washington, DC.  I'll be primarily writing for their magazine, learning how to write grants, and helping to create material for their Family Strengthening program.  

My orientation starts in DC on July 17, and I'll be down there for the next year.  Once I find out more info about where I'll be living and how I can be reached (I'm gonna get a cell phone down there, I think) I'll let everyone know.

So, basically, for a year I'm gonna be real po'--but I'm also going to have an amazing opportunity to write for a nonprofit two blocks away from the White House.  I think I can handle that trade-off.  :)"

I just want to say thank you.  You are the first people who have ever loved anything remotely close to who I really am.  You are my first and only friends.  

Running the professor gauntlet was the most incredible thing I've ever experienced at Hiram.  So much sensory overload...I got to say goodbye to Kirsten and Greg, to Ellen and Joyce, to Ella and Rick and Robert and Mary Ann, to Gail and to Linda.  That, more than anything, I want to remember.  All of them in their regalia, hundreds of years of education all piled up in velvet, telling us goodbye.  My peach mortarboard fell off and I just ran, ran down the line, touching them.

Peach goodbye was too short, and I had to make goodbye be goodbye.  I missed the 5:00 B-Side farewell because my parents wanted me home.  I packed up and bawled and couldn't be held because my mother was there.

I don't know what to say yet.  I don't understand that it's over.  I just know that I love you all so much, so much more than I could ever show you.

"event","deck the halls: it's a kos family xmas.

So my family is talking about what my mother saw on an episode of Ripley's Believe it or Not: a woman who had an entire dress, scarf and hat made out of her own hair.  The conversation got worse, if you can believe it:

Dad: It's like the big fat black women with the long nails (he makes a swirly movement with his finger to suggest long, curling nails).
(family agrees with this)
Cousin Carol: And they all play Bingo.
Grandma: They must have markers.
Cousin Carol: They do!  
Mom: How do they wipe their butts?
Cousin Carol: That was my next question.
Mom: I don't want to think about it.
Cousin Carol: They like the nails like their men like gold teeth.
Grandma: Or diamond, or platinum.
Lauren (my little niece): Hahahahahahahah.

So, speaking of Cousin Carol, who is clearly a dyke: she is wearing CHRISTMAS FLANNEL.  I shit you not.  It's red, silver and black, and has sparkly borders with candy canes on them.  If my case didn't rest before now, it certainly does today.

More updates as the evening progresses.  It's gonna be a good one.

Update 1, 8:30 p.m.--Dad's pretty liquored up, and he's holding the new karaoke machine on his shoulder while ""jamming"" to that Ciara song.  You know the one--""Automatic supersonic / hypnotic funky fresh, /
Work my body so melodic, / The beat flows right through my chest.""

Is it bedtime yet?"

Grandma Kos (bear in mind she doesn't turn her hearing aid up loud enough): DIDJA HEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MAKING THE WOMEN AT THE AIRPORTS DO?
Grandma Skipp: What?
Grandma Kos: THEY'RE MAKING THEM TAKE THEIR BLOUSES OFF.
Me (to Mom): Meh?
Grandma Kos: IT'S TRUE.  I SAW IT IN THE NATIONAL NEWS.
Grandma Skipp (sarcastically): Well, you'd better wear a button-down shirt when you fly to Charlotte so you don't muss your hair.
Cousin Carol: I got a card says I don't have to go through that.
Mom: Because of all the metal in you?
Cousin Carol: Yeah."

I'm going to the bar.

My subtitle is _____ because _____.
My friends page is called _____ because _____.
My username is ____ because _____.
My default userpic is _____ because _____.

My journal is called ""Petra Peccavi"" because it's a bastardization of the phrase ""pater peccavi""--meaning ""Father, I have sinned.""  And I like that.

My subtitle is ""The proud are broken on the wheel"" because it's a description of my favorite deadly sin's punishment.  According to Dante, the proud get strapped to a wheel and all their bones get broken over and over.  Mmmm.

My friends page is called ""the wheel"" for obvious reasons (see subtitle).

My username is ""lungglitter"" because Maddox posted something once about the lame teenybopper craze, and he said that eventually little girls would run out of body parts to sparkle, so Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would start selling lung glitter.

My default userpic is a cutting from an illustration done by Brett Helquist, the same guy who does the illustrations for the Lemony Snicket books.  The whole picture is of a group of people in a cafe all appearing to read books, but their eyes are staring disdainfully at each other.  It's quite a cool pic.  Because?  Because I like it."

"event","Well, worst did come to worst.  Bush is in office for another four years, barring something terrible happening--and by terrible, I mean both something incapacitating to Bush (I may despise the guy, but I don't wish him harm) and the fact that, if not Bush, then Dick ""Fuck You"" Cheney would be stepping up.

I understand why my Republican friends voted for W (although I think they're SERIOUSLY misguided).  In fact, I used to be a Republican myself, back in high school.  I loved the allure of being a Young Republican, of cloistering myself amongst people who were just like me, of feeling good about lower taxes (more money for me!) and believing myself to be morally superior.  I'm not saying all Republicans are like that, but that was the image I had, and I didn't see a whole lot within the party that would contradict me.

My image of a Republican was always the same--a white, blonde girl in a pink Lacoste polo with the collar popped.  Khaki pants.  Protestantism.  I believed that Republicans were smarter, better educated, wealthier and classier.  And since I wanted to be all those things, I was a Republican.

And then I got to college.  I found out what things really mattered for me.  I started to learn more about myself.  I started to fight for freedoms, for causes.  I became a proud card-carrying member of the ACLU.  And once I became a Democrat, I realized how much better the country could be.  I joined a party of people willing to sacrifice for others, for underprivileged people.  I joined a party of people who wanted to fight for a woman's right to choose, for a couple's right to marry, for a child's right to education.  And I've never been happier.

Yeah, maybe I'm a dirty liberal.  But I'm damned proud of it.  I know in my heart that I made the right decision when I punched that hole for John Kerry yesterday.  I just wish more people had done the same.

And, if you'll forgive me, I have to rant a little: everyone who voted for George W. Bush, I want to let you know that you support a candidate who vehemently refuses to let me get married.  Someday I'd like to be married.  I've reconciled that with myself, with my God, and with my family.  Who are you to take that away from me?"

"event","My dad's a miracle and so's my mom
They fly over the blue. 
They finish their dinner and then they take one another's hand
And off they go to find a broader point of view. 
For it's a give and take beyond the ordinary. 
What with all the cats and kids that they've loved. 
And they will not be alone. 

My friends give me purple flowers and orange tea
On goosedown spilling quilts and turquoise chairs
We greet each other in a wild profusion of words
And wave farewell amidst the wonderment of air
And in the laughing times we know that we are lucky
And in the quiet times we know that we are blessed
And we will not be alone

Well, the light that stopped the night felt like forgiveness to you
As the garbage trucks came bustling through their rounds
You stared at the pictures on your wall and all the postcards from your friends
As you heard the birds and old familiar sounds
An that's when you knew this world can't be saved, only discovered
And you knew things could be different than before
And you will not be alone anymore

see you all on saturday.  hope you're in your rooms, 'cause i may get real bored on the train and have to give my six other sad dwarves a call.

i love you."

"event","Okay, I am officially the laziest person in the world.  Here is why: I have taken to putting my toothbrush and toothpaste on my bookshelf, because it's just too much work to take them all the way over to my dresser, because that's all the way across the room.  I live in a DORM ROOM.  It is no larger than a standard jail cell.  Yet, somehow, it seems like too much of a freaking hassle to trek the uncharted reaches of my carpet to the dresser, shining like a beacon way off in the horizon.

Also, I am a slob.  My room is an orgy of unwashed clothes and dirty tissues.  People won't even come in past the entrance anymore.  Hannah was down here tonight trying to do an impression of a certain very VERY crazy person and she couldn't do it right because she kept hitting my coat and my trash can.  Which has no trash bag in it.  It looks like my room has vomited all over itself.

Additionally, I am getting real bad about doing my homework.  It's like I'm in high school again, but not as bad as being in middle school.  Right now, my general plan seems to be, screw around all night, then wake up at 7 a.m. and do homework.  Which I suppose works, but isn't really the ideal situation.  The biggest motivator I had to do work tonight was not Phi Beta Kappa or Magna cum Laude, but being told that I wasn't allowed to watch the Daily Show until I did some fucking work already.

I am so pathetic and useless.  I would bump myself off but it would just be too much freaking effort.  Thank God I have a loveseat and not a sofa, or else I'd never even make it to bed.  I would be too lazy to actually go to the sleeping place.  Isn't that precious?"

"event","Ooh, so much development for such a short amount of time.

First: for those of you who don't already know, I spent most of today either in bed or in Urgent Care.  I woke up this morning with a very uncomfortable feeling in the abdomen area, and then realized after I took a shower that I was probably going to keel over, so I got in the car and drove to St. Joe's in Howland, which thank God is only one town over.

So I got there and the woman at the counter is asking me questions like, ""Who is your doctor?"" and I swear to God, I was in so much pain that I couldn't remember.  I couldn't remember my doctor's name.  I was just like, ""urrrrrrghghghghghgh.""  But I guess they had my old doctor on file, and I was like, ""Whatever, that'll work.""  

So I sat in the waiting room for fifteen incredibly uncomfortable minutes (although I did get to watch a great interview with Laura Innes on Regis and Kelly) and then I got back to the examination room.  They got mad at me because I...okay, I'm going to put a cut here, so if you don't want to read about my gross stuff, don't click here. 
<lj-cut>
They got mad because I couldn't piss in a cup enough for them.  I was like, look, that is why I'm here, I have a really severe UTI and I just want some medicine.  Because I get these things sometimes, and I know what they feel like.  And they were like, we can't give you medicine on symptoms alone.  Which I suppose is reasonable, but I was still real pissed.  </lj-cut>

Okay, gross part over.  So anyway, finally I did what they needed me to do (see cut) and the doctor made me lay down and she prodded me for about five minutes to make sure I didn't have kidneyitis or something.  And then she left, and I got real pissy, and then I threw up in their sink twice.  And felt really vengeful about it.  I was like, HA.  TAKE THAT.  And then they gave me medicine, and I called my parents and had them drive me home because I couldn't drive.

Anyway, that's that.  I am well-medicated now (not overmedicated for a change--everloving Andrea put up with me being completely wired the other night because of the medicine I thought would fix me but so didn't) and feeling much better.  

Second: I got a haircut.  A real bad, real butch one.  I look like Gina Gershon in <i>Bound</i> but not nearly as hot and with no bangs.  It is so bad that I'm actually considering taking the hair I cut off for kids with cancer and paying $300 to get it reattached to my head at a salon.  Because, you know, I'm probably going to Hell anyway.  

Liz, you know about hair extensions--are they worth it?  I miss long hair.

So, sorry to Team Prissypants for not coming out to give my haggy support.  I was there in spirit.  <3"

Betrayed in mute geometry of broken

"event","<u>Characters</u>
Abbey: A twenty-year-old young woman, a senior in college.  She is tall, thin, and pretentiously pseudo-educated.  A liberal.
Jake: A fifteen-year-old young man, a sophomore in high school.  He is also tall and thin, but where Abbey is Democrat and AP English, Jake is NASCAR and summer school.  
Christy: Their mother.  Short, dark-haired and tanning-booth tanned, she is well-dressed but tired.

NOTE: The actors playing Abbey and Jake should look remarkably similar, as if they were twins born four or five years apart.  Same height, nearly the same weight, same lanky way of carrying themselves.  When they fight, their body language should even be similar--hands waving, heads bobbing, flailing gawkily.

<u>Setting</u>
A kitchen attached to a dining room.  Pastels--teals, tans, pinks--are everywhere.  The furniture is mahogany and everywhere are vases full of stargazer lilies.  The residue of a messy girl is centered around the TV (e.g. Milky Way miniatures, old napkins).  In the corner is an all-season Christmas tree, tarted up to look like the Fourth of July.  There is a chandelier.

<B><I><U>THE RAGING SCUMBAG 
or HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BRO</b></i></u>

<lj-cut>
Yeah, this is where the play should go, but I've grown weary of script format.  Here's what went down:

I was sitting in the kitchen watching the Democratic National Convention, eating Milky Way Miniatures and drinking water.

<i>ABBEY: At the right moment, a tall glass of water with three ice cubes in it is almost orgasmic.</i>

All of a sudden, Jake (who was sitting in the living room) told me that he was done with the laptop.  (We share a laptop, since I can't make mine load up to the wireless net in the house.)  I asked him where it was.

<I>JAKE: Downstairs.</I>

I went downstairs to get the laptop.  I was gone for a maximum of thirty seconds, long enough to say hello to my father and to unplug the power cord.  I went upstairs and found my brother sitting among the wrappers, watching the Ladies' Hold 'Em Poker Tour or something on ESPN2.  

<i>ABBEY: HEY OMG WHAT ARE YOU DOING I WAS WATCHING.</i>
<I>JAKE: You have the computer now.
ABBEY: That is BULLCRAP.  You ALWAYS have both the computer and the TV.  
JAKE: Well, now I have nothing to do.
ABBEY: And that's my fault?</i>

So I, of course, do what any rational twenty-year-old would do.

<I>ABBEY: MOMMMMMMMMMMM.</i>

Anyway, to make a long story short, he called me a bitch as he walked away.

I told Mom it was funny.  I was like, ""look, it's cathartic.  He's been wanting to say it for, like, five years.  I'm glad he finally did.""

And then I watched the DNC.

"event","Marginalia
by Billy Collins

Sometimes the notes are ferocious,
skirmishes against the author
raging along the borders of every page
in tiny black script.
If I could just get my hands on you,
Kierkegaard, or Conor Cruise O'Brien,
they seem to say,
I would bolt the door and beat some logic into your head.

Other comments are more offhand, dismissive -
""Nonsense."" ""Please!"" ""HA!!"" -
that kind of thing.
I remember once looking up from my reading,
my thumb as a bookmark,
trying to imagine what the person must look like
why wrote ""Don't be a ninny""
alongside a paragraph in The Life of Emily Dickinson.

Students are more modest
needing to leave only their splayed footprints
along the shore of the page.
One scrawls ""Metaphor"" next to a stanza of Eliot's.
Another notes the presence of ""Irony""
fifty times outside the paragraphs of A Modest Proposal.

Or they are fans who cheer from the empty bleachers,
Hands cupped around their mouths.
""Absolutely,"" they shout
to Duns Scotus and James Baldwin.
""Yes."" ""Bull's-eye."" My man!""
Check marks, asterisks, and exclamation points
rain down along the sidelines.

And if you have manage to graduate from college
without ever having written ""Man vs. Nature""
in a margin, perhaps now
is the time to take one step forward.

We have all seized the white perimeter as our own
and reached for a pen if only to show
we did not just laze in an armchair turning pages;
we pressed a thought into the wayside,
planted an impression along the verge.

Even Irish monks in their cold scriptoria
jotted along the borders of the Gospels
brief asides about the pains of copying,
a bird signing near their window,
or the sunlight that illuminated their page-
anonymous men catching a ride into the future
on a vessel more lasting than themselves.

And you have not read Joshua Reynolds,
they say, until you have read him
enwreathed with Blake's furious scribbling.

Yet the one I think of most often,
the one that dangles from me like a locket,
was written in the copy of Catcher in the Rye
I borrowed from the local library
one slow, hot summer.
I was just beginning high school then,
reading books on a davenport in my parents' living room,
and I cannot tell you
how vastly my loneliness was deepened,
how poignant and amplified the world before me seemed,
when I found on one page

A few greasy looking smears
and next to them, written in soft pencil-
by a beautiful girl, I could tell,
whom I would never meet-
""Pardon the egg salad stains, but I'm in love."""

"event","Today, after much thought, I've decided that I'm going to marry an Italian.

I thought of the idea after coming home from work and finding a big, salty tub full of homemade wedding soup in the fridge, and I cemented the idea after the saucy Briar Hill pizza we had for dinner.

Sure, they can be hairy.  But I have to marry an Italian--and I will have fish on New Year's if I have to.  The Italians that I know, not to be stereotypical, have all been passionate and angry, proud and intense, unconditionally devoted and unconventionally attractive.  

I used to pretend that I was Italian when I was little--people tended to assume that my family was, because we ate so much pasta and drank so much wine and fought and cried and laughed so much.  It's only my pale skin and last name that give me away as decidedly Eastern European.  But if I marry an Italian, I can end up with a mellifluous and multi-syllabic last name, vowel-heavy and rich.

Though I am built and look like my Scottish-British mother, I resemble my father, in his quasi-Italian way, and we share our thick dark plentiful hair and big noses.  He makes his own pizza on weekends and he's taught me how to make sauce that bubbles all day (with basil from the garden, of course).  I've never been afraid of goat's cheese because I was reared on Romano.  He still says ""eye-talian"" but he grew up in Niles, with the old nonnas who sold their sauce and dough for fifty cents on Sunday mornings.

This isn't meant to be an ego stroker for all the Italians I know--and it's not meant to further stereotypes or deny my love for other heritages (I'm particularly fond of Greeks and Croats as well).  But today's been an Italian day, and I feel like going to High Mass."

I didn't know her--I don't know her--and when I do something wrong, she's always there to see it.  I'll still eat the candy anyway, though, because it's free candy.

Looking forward to August 1.  Looking forward to the end of July, when I'll be housesitting for the Alperns and thus around to stir up trouble.  Looking forward to school and, for the first time, looking forward to change.  It's been a strange month and I'm learning things every day.

p.s. Elizabeth rocks my world.

p.p.s. <i>Now the world has gone to bed,
Darkness won't engulf my head,
I can see by infrared,
How I hate the night.

Now I lay me down to sleep,
Try to count electric sheep,
Sweet dream wishes you can keep,
How I hate the night.

"event","The benefits of living on the border of a redneck town are slim.  Except on the Fourth of July, when the hillbilly neighbors throw a party for fifty dollars a head, and set off an hour's worth of bright boom sparkle lights that aren't legal in this town but are okay in the next.

Our development ends and bourgeois becomes boondocks right across the street from me.  Cortland ends and Fowler begins where the field starts, or maybe at the fault line from an earthquake twenty years old.  Bees nest, birds nest, poison ivy strangles in Fowler, where the fields grow.

The soundtrack to a rip-roarin' Fourth of July--""Proud to be an American,"" ""Born in the USA,"" and my favorite, ""Dream the Impossible Dream"" (ah, la Mancha) scream tinny from an old boombox that I like to pretend is gray.  The sky lights up and flashes and yells and the sirens yell, the Cortland cops, and then the ringleader yells at the cops--""This is FOWLER township, Goddammit!"" and the cops scoot away.

Here's the scene--Dad and Jake and I are setting off bottle rockets that we rest in a sideways cinder block (unlike Fowler, we limit our dirty uncouth to the backyard, behind the sagging fence).  They screech up and pop, sad red-headed stepchildren to what's going on down the street.  Mom and the new widow next door watch the fireworks from the front lawn.  Then we all go inside because the mosquitoes bite and we know the flashes will just die in the end.

Happy 4th of July on the 5th."

"event","And I'm taking his quiz:

LIFE
1. Would you rather drown or be buried alive?  Drown.  The water is prettier than dirt.
2. Would you kill somebody in defense of your own life?  Absolutely--that's why it's called self-defense :P
3. Is it right to impose your moral decisions on anybody else? (e.g. pro-life) No, but it's right to educate people about them if they feel like listening.
4. If you COULD live forever, would you?  No.  Life is finite for a reason.
5. Life is __________.  (finite for a reason?)  beautiful.

ECONOMICS
1. Do you care that illegal movies only hurt the people barely making a living in film?  Yes.  I don't watch illegal movies.
2. How much of your paycheck do you set aside for savings?  I don't really have a ""savings account.""  I just put it all in checking and then save what I can.
3. Do you use, or abuse, your credit card?  Use.  
4. Do you follow a monthly budget or just pay out anything for whatever comes your way?  I have a rough budget that I follow.
5. What's your approximate monthly income?  That's kind of nosy--about $1000/month during the summer and probably about $200 a month during the year

SOCIETY
1. What do you look for in a friend? Or do you accept anyone who will talk to you? I look for smart, creative and original people who always keep learning.
2. True or false, there is little if any gap between upper and middle class in the US.  False!  The middle class is broke, on the whole, because the media tells them that they can live like the upper class, so they stop saving and start buying SUVs.  The upper class saves and that's the only way to get there from the middle class.
3. The problem with society is the _______________.  Closed-minded people.
4. Are you friendly to EVERYONE?  No.  Some people irritate me.
5. Do you let some people think you're friends when you really don't see it that way?  I try not to be overly friendly, but I'll be polite.

POLITICS
1. We spend millions on sending food to starving nations while people starve to death here. Right or wrong?  Right--people are people.
2. True or false, the US Government is a bipartisan hierarchy.  False--it's basically two aspects of the same moderate party.
3. We declare war on terror and send tanks into the middle east, spending billions. We declared war on poverty earlier, shall we send tanks to Appalachia?  :P  You can't declare war on concepts.  Every war we've ever fought against abstraction--terror, drugs, poverty--we have lost because things like that aren't quantifiable.  War against Iraq?  We can win that.  War against ""terror""?  We'll never win it.
4. Was our presence in Iraq right or wrong?  I think it was wrong, but that's my opinion.
5. Does George Bush II remind you of Curious George?  He is kind of simian.

RELIGION
1. I believe in ____________.  Humanity
2. What's going to happen when you die?  I'll get what I deserve.
3. Church/Temple is ____________.  A good way to worship if you choose.
4. What is your favorite religious holiday?  I like Christmas, but not just because we get presents.  It always feels very spiritual to me, with all the tradition.
5. What is your favorite religious holiday that you're not technically allowed to celebrate?  I like Shabbat dinner, which isn't exactly a ""holiday.""

MEN vs. WOMEN
1. On a whole, the more aesthetic gender is ____________.  Women.  Obviously.
2. If you could choose to have parts from both sexes, which would you acquire?  The ability to gain muscle mass like a man.
3. True or false, guys are dumb.  Some are, some aren't.  Just like women.
4. True or false, blondes have more fun.  Seriously, I have heard this is true.
5. Name a celebrity body you enjoy staring at and why.  Alan Rickman.  Look at his face!

RANDOMNESS
1. If you were a tree, what tree would you be?  A hazel tree.  According to the Celtic astrology thing that I don't know or care about its validity, ""In Irish Celtic mythology the hazel tree was where the Faery spirits lived. The hazel nut in Celtic legends is an emblem of concentrated wisdom and all the knowledge of the arts and sciences was to be found by eating these nuts.""  August 28, baybee.
2. What's your favorite upholstery?  I like corduroy.
3. Boxers, briefs, or commando?  Boxers.
4. Bra or braless?  Um, bra?
5. How stupid was this?  It was better than some."

"event","Alumni weekend=fun.  I got to hang out with a group of people I don't normally get to see but who I've always enjoyed--and it was fun being a peach-in-training for the weekend.  The alums were great, especially Alice Webster '54 who I got to take to her dorm.  She was fabulous and very spunky.

Added some new friends to my friends list.  :)  

Also, it is FREEZING in the Advance office, where I'm stuck for the rest of the day researching former Advance editors for ColRel.  Ugh.

"event","It's been a long time since I posted anything substantive.  Mostly, the things that I post are quiz results.  I didn't realize how many I'd been posting until I looked back at my recent entries.  It's sad when the most creative thing I've come up with in months is the ""ye olde milkshake"" thing, and I didn't even make that.

So what's new with me?  I just got hired for a job--in the same office I've been hired in since my freshman year.  But this is cool.  More responsibility.  I'll be spearheading a project that, hopefully, will organize alumni together for the Hiram magazine, and get them to write columns/suggest ideas/volunteer to be liaisons.  It's a big job, a year-long project.  It's gonna be cool and hard work.  I'm excited.  :)

Books read so far this summer:  Dracula, Frankenstein, some book my mom has about the Secrets of Happy People (all useful things like, ""Have a positive outlook!""  Whatever.)  I'm going to the library soon to get more of my colloquium books and to start on the towering pile that is ""Visions of India.""

Things written: Nothing good, except for a couple creative e-mails.  I wrote a poem about one word that ended up being some sort of horrible 2:00 a.m. diatribe on the state of humanity.  It was a piece of crap, naturally.

Movies seen: Shrek 2, Prisoner of Azkaban.  Both highly recommended.

Days wasted: Lots.

I'm starting to get all fired up about graduate school.  I bought a GRE book, which I keep referring to as a GED book by mistake (""Hey, look!  I'll be so ready for the GED!"")  What I've learned?  GRE=tricky.  Prolix=wordy.  Also, I've been e-mailing students at different colleges around the country--Harvard, Berkeley, etc.  The Harvard chick said not to bother.

Might go to London for three months, even though it would make me look like a total loser.  But I figure, I'm a loser regardless, so I might as well be a loser in Europe.

I think that's it.  I think that's everything.  If I think of anything else, I'll let you know."

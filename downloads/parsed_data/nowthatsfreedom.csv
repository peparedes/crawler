"event","You know im getting really sick and tired of being treated like a 3 year old in my house.. All i wanna do is take a train with Alex to see Ari and Anna and peoples.. but no.. my parents are retards.. im getting really sick of this.. WHAT DID I DO? HUH.. was it getting good grade.. was it going places with them.. was it being nice.. was it putting up with them.. REALLY.. i dont know anymore.. and i dont care they are really angering me.. and have no reason or logic.. i could say i have to go or the world will explode (and not be lying) and they would still say no because they are so convinced they are right..... I'm willing to prove them wrong...."

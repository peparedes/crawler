p.s. person, I think you could maybe shut up forever?  because the things you say are dumb.  I'd say you should know better, but honestly I think that might be giving you too much credit.

New Year's Resolution: Improve my self-control.





To anyone I may have hurt in this past year: I'm sorry.  I was trying to do the right thing the whole time, by myself and by everyone.  I can at least say for certain that I did genuinely care, and everything I said or did was in honesty.  But honesty and good intentions aren't everything, and I think I made some bad judgment calls...what I've learned from them to take into the future is that I've got to trust my intuition and I need to fight my impulsivity.

These are things I've always known but they're so much easier to say than actually do.  Still, I'm getting better at it all the time...I'm not into hurting people unnecessarily, so I'm gonna get it accomplished."

Sure, so they exploitatively faked lesbianism to get attention!  And yes, it's true that all their songs sound the same!  They are quite possibly the most obviously thoroughly-manufactured pop music act of all time.

But I love 'em for it!!  Total, shameless fakeness plus infectiously danceable songs--what more could you possibly want from major-label girlpop?  And t.A.T.u. delivers these things in excess.  I mean, t.A.T.u. is the whole pop-group package: annoyingly misspelled, unnecessarily difficult-to-write, preteen-esque name...lots of superslutty gimmicks in a hilariously obvious bid for sex appeal (I mean, how many times did they say in interviews that they had sex four times a day, every day?)...and hyperproduced, cookiecutter songs which are impossible not to dance to.  Honestly, it's only annoying when manufactured pop stars try to pretend that they're actually doing anything for themselves, and there's certainly no threat of that with my girls in t.A.T.u.!


So come on, lesbians.  Don't lie.  You know you secretly love their songs as much as I do.  I know it's basically a community rule to say (or at least not deny) that they make the worst music ever, but let's face it: fake gay or no fake gay, t.A.T.u.'s music is some of the best prepackaged major-label pop to hit radio stations in years!  Besides, the gay in their music just is kind of a bonus, cause the songs aren't offensive in themselves, it's just their image that's ridiculous.


Ahh.  Doesn't it feel good to get that off your chests?  Haha."

I can't stop thinking about things that don't matter, or maybe the only things that really matter.  All this Art Theory is getting to me!  I think about art all the time; the way I think about it, it's no different from thinking about life all the time.

Sense something wrong here?</center>




First read <b><a href=""http://www.frankhilliard.com/daughters/introduction.cfm"">this</a></b> (don't forget to check out the <a href=""http://www.frankhilliard.com/daughters/index.cfm"">cover illustration</a>!).


Then read <b>my response: </b><lj-cut text=""Dear Mr. Hilliard..."">


Dear Mr. Hilliard,

I happened upon the website of your book ""Daughters of Slaves"" and read the intro.  I feel compelled to comment on it; I find that it's far more useful to explain rationally why something offends you than to react with anger immediately. 

To start, I will give you my first reason for finding your intro objectionable: It's not necessarily <i>what</i> you're saying, it's <i>how</i> you're saying it.  I appreciate that you suggest that generations of abuse by men is what caused the state of female sexuality in the form that it exists in your experience--I agree that our imbalanced heterosexual history has played a huge part in forming our cultural, sexual attitudes, male and female alike.  However, what you seem to fail to realize is that the way you defend these theories--in particular when you suggest that women who will challenge your views are simply trying to continue hiding something that you have already figured out (""The problem women have discussing this subject is that they think there's nothing to discuss. They think female sexuality is so complicated, so complex, so well-hidden, it can never be winkled out. Like an oyster on the seabed, women believe their disguise is perfect."")--shows yet another instance of that disregard for women's intellectual capabilities and the worth of their opinions--the very thing you have identified as the age-old problem afflicting contemporary sexuality. 

I think this passage also shows the aforementioned disregard: ""Asking women about sex is like asking fish about water. They're so immersed in it, they don't know what it is any more. For a woman, sex is life, essentially indescribable. And anyway, they'll add, it's none of your business.  This book is going to make it your business.""

In your own words, you acknowledge women saying that their sexuality is none of men's business--and in the very next sentence, you instantly dismiss women's ownership and expertise of their own sexuality by simply taking what they would not give you--permission to analyze female sexuality--and sharing it with other men who have no more authority nor ability to expound on the personal experiences of women than you do.

In my own experience as a woman, I've found that I and many women who are asked respectfully are generally very willing and happy to discuss the intricacies of female sexuality--it interests them just as much as it does you.  However, the most common reason for a woman to reply that female sexuality is not a man's business--in other words, refuse to discuss it with him--is if that man is being disrespectful, perhaps assuming he already knows the answers to the questions he should be asking.  If you have not had luck with women in this arena, I suggest you read your own words to figure out why they might not be inclined to reveal their most passionate sexual natures to you.

Another fundamental flaw in your logic, as it seems to me, is that the 'problem' you reference in male-female sexual interaction seems to be thus: women are driven by years of historical mistreatment to defensively conceal the sexy 'bad' girl within, thereby leaving men unable to put together media images of 'bad' girls and the 'good', sexless girls they know from day-to-day life.

It seems to me, Mr. Hilliard, that women not being overtly sexual presents a far greater problem to men (specifically, men who want the pleasure of encountering sexually stimulating women in every environment) than it does to women.  Women live the sexual lives they live; I find it rather presumptuous that you seem to feel yourself entitled to burst into the scene, full of rather arrogant assumptions that you've figured out women's grown-of-necessity 'disguise' of concealing their sexualities from men, presuming to 'solve' this 'problem' and clue in other men to the mysteries you've unraveled.  This is particularly troubling since the driving force behind your concern for the state of women's sexual health seems to be that the women you interact with daily aren't 'sexy' enough.

In your intro, you ask 'Why not?' in response to a hypothetical challenge of your authority on this subject.  The reason I am presenting to you in this email is this: Women's sexuality is not the property of men, not yours nor the men you are writing your book for.  It is formed by women, controlled by women, and to be decided how to be used by women as it suits them in the course of their own lives.  Whatever observations you may have made in the course of your 40 years, I find it highly unlikely that you have enough expertise in the area to be challenging <i>women</i> on the matter of female sexuality.

I agree with your belief that women have as strong a sex drive as men, although it certainly manifests itself differently.  I think there are indeed more similarities between male and female sexualities than are perhaps perceived in common wisdom.  However, there are also strong and important differences.  A primary one which your intro does not place value on--in fact, which it actively degrades--is the importance inherent in a woman's sexuality that the right to define it is hers and hers alone--and what you seem not to realize is that the insulting attitude of your language absolutely undermines whatever good ideas you <i>do</i> have to present to your readers.  

You may understand some parts of female sexuality--but if you don't understand and respect women's right to define their own sexuality (including their right to conceal it when and if they so desire), you have missed out on perhaps the most important part of understanding the sexual nature of women.  Your readers are being misled--these little snippets of ideas will not help them if they get them embedded in something fundamentally repulsive to contemporary women--disrespect.  <i>That's</i> not going to help them with the ladies at all.

Essentially, I am saying that it is not any man's place to assume that because a given woman is not 'sexually liberated'--or, as you put it, a 'bad' girl--that she is necessarily suffering from an antiquated defense mechanism that must be overcome in the interest of better personal and societal health.  Remember, almost every woman has revealed her more lusty, sexual side to <i>someone</i>, more likely many someones, over the course of her life--simply because she does not choose to reveal it to you, or to most men in general, or in certain situations (such as at her job), does not mean she is in some way lacking in sexual health.  It just means the other parts of her personality that are equally as important as sexuality are being prioritized in a given environment.

If you want to solve the problems between men and women, Mr. Hilliard, I would say the first step is to try a little basic respect.  Maybe then we can all begin to move beyond our history.


Sincerely,
Amy</lj-cut>




Okay, this isn't the best-written letter--I'm hoping you'll cut me some slack, as I was incensed at the time!"

<b>The menace of multiculturalism</b>
<i>By Suzanne Fields</i>

It's not easy to dislodge a trendy fad, particularly among the public intellectuals and the aspiring sophisticates of the chattering class, but ""multiculturalism"" may be getting an intellectual re-examination. The strivers so easily captured by the hula hoops of academic imagination have a long way to go, but the signs are there (and not a moment too soon). 

 ""Multiculturalism"" is the notion that all cultures are inherently equal; the notion should not only be tolerated, but encouraged. The Judeo-Christian values that undergirded the founding of our country and inspired the moral rules that bound us together in a common culture, honored even when honored in the breach, are to be held in doubt and suspicion. When these values were deconstructed, so that they no longer held us together, the literary, philosophical and historical canons of Western civilization changed.

 Young people, naturally given to critiquing anything and everything their parents believe, became easily indoctrinated with the fashionable notions of multiculturalism. Disarmed, they could not defend the culture that produced their freedoms and the good life in which to enjoy those freedoms. They were soon not even capable of perceiving the consequences that flow from an inability to make distinctions. Instead of appreciating the self-correcting freedoms growing out of the common culture -- leading to the end of slavery, the relief of oppressed women, and the civil-rights revolution that propelled blacks into the mainstream -- the young were encouraged to focus on the negatives of Western history. The manifest shortcomings of other cultures were cheerfully ignored.  

 The great contemporary fault line of multiculturalism is the tolerance of Islamist barbarity that passes for understanding. This has led to the conspicuous inability to recognize the dark side of Islam that politicizes authentic religious faith and produces the terrorism that stalks the civilized world. Though only a small number of Muslims actually perceive murder as a religious duty, millions of Muslims support those who do, and many millions more conspicuously refrain from criticizing the evil-doers, either from fear or from a desire to see their faith became dominant across the world.

 As a result, ""multiculturalism"" has become ideology that menaces a culture unable to defend itself. This multiculturalism undercuts assimilation and fosters an anti-American bias in favor of cultures determined to destroy our own. The British example says it all. Multiculturalism in England was shaped not only by academicians, but by civil servants, think tanks, minority pressure groups, center-left politicians, and what John O'Sullivan calls with irony ""the Great and the Good."" In The New Criterion magazine, he argues that certain government institutions, together with the popular media, created an ideology of ""institutional correctness"" of condescending anthropology. The British government, unrestrained by constitutional guarantees of separation of church and state, subsidized ethnic, religious, and linguistic ghettoes by supporting ""faith schools,"" where minority children were encouraged to maintain the cultures their parents fled. In the interest of tolerance, men and women who knew better rationalized the suppression of women, genital mutilation and even ""honor killings"" by Muslims. Better to let the natives keep their quaint customs rather than impose common values that smack of ""Britishness.""

 The bombings in London, however, changed the debate. When the British learned that their suicide bombers were home-grown, recruited from minorities who were not marginalized -- the bombers had grown up playing cricket -- multiculturalism as a guiding ideology was suddenly suspect. The Dutch before them had begun to rethink multiculturalism as well, when a radical Muslim murdered the filmmaker Theo Van Gogh in Amsterdam for his criticism of Islamic suppression of women. The killer left an Islamist manifesto spiked to his breast.

 Though not as daffy over multiculturalism as the Netherlands or Britain, America has been moving that way. The melting pot of assimilation, which has nurtured the American dream for more than two centuries, has become ever more suspect. A poll for the Pew Hispanic Center finds that 55 percent of Americans of Mexican descent consider themselves Mexicans first. A similar study of Muslim immigrants in Los Angeles finds that only 10 percent think of themselves as Americans rather than citizens of the countries they abandoned for new lives here.

 Multiculturalism has become both masochistic and condescending. Born of good and generous intentions, it inevitably led to cultural amnesia, sapping the strength of the common bond. ""An unintended and beneficial consequence of the London bombings,"" writes John O'Sullivan, ""is the transformation of the debate in Britain over multiculturalism."" The clock is ticking here, too.

Well, if it is too crowded....then maybe all my (and Manda's?) friends can come up to the attic (our living quarters) if they want, as long as Manda's okay with that, just to spread out the crowd a bit.  

You see, I am not a big fan of really overcrowded parties.  Not at all.  Well, we will overcome the problem somehow, if it even comes up, that is--hopefully the fact that it's on a Wednesday night will keep the guest population down to a manageable level.  

Besides, what could possibly trouble me right after seeing a Wiggles concert with Diane and Manda?


I WILL TELL YOU THE ANSWER IS NOTHING!!!



Just so all my friends know: I will not be at the party till approximately 8:30 pm, even though the start time is 8:00.  I'm coming back from a Wiggles concert in DC, so I'll be late to my own party.  But you can come anytime you want; food is at 8."

I have become tired of the name ""Laelithe"" because I made it up when I was like 13 and it means NOTHING.  

Therefore, I have decided to erase Laelithe entirely and replace it with a much more mature name:

"event","Man, so I read Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  I waited in line for it at midnight.  Because I'm that sort of nurd, but that's okay, you like it.  All of you.  All of you meaning me.

Oh.......MAN!!  The book was so good, and so shocking.  Especially when Harry, Ron, and Hermione all got married to each other.  JUST KIDDING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.  But it should have, as that would've made the book even more interesting.

But man, yeah.  Read it if you haven't, it's delicious.



Also I signed up at Maryland, got a schedule and everything as of today--my school email is stupe@umd.edu.

Not that anyone needs to know that, I just like that my login name everywhere on the Maryland site is now ""stupe"".  Haha.

Also I joined ""the facebook""...dubious that I'll use it much, but either way: Diane--if you read this post, I made a Wiggles group, it is hot hot hot much like a potato."

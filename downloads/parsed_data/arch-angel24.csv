I wanted you to know 
That I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph
And I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

{Both}
Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore

The worst is over now

And no one left to fight {Both}
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

"event","yeah today really fucking sucked... we have figured out that she always needs someone to be pissed at & i think i figured out how she picks the person... it's the first fucking person she sees or talks to... and today I was that person... she asked why Sherri was here already & i said because she needed to come in an hour early & leave an hour early, & she just walked away from me & didn't even let me explain why... she thought we wouldn't have enough register people for the last hour we were open today because we're having inventory today & closing @ 6pm... so i asked Sherri if she would explain why she needed to come in early & she said ok well then Karen (that's my bosses name; isn't it lovely) comes over to me while i'm doing my job & asks if i said anything to Sherri & i was like yeah because you were pissed & didn't let me explain why... then she's like well that just caused me more problems... i was fucking pissed... if she really wants i can cause her a lot more fucking problems than she can handle... basically the rest of the day she was just being a bitch & snotty, but when she was walking around with her boss, Andy, she was all nice & laughing... i swear if i heard her laugh one more time i was going to rip out her throat... i don't think i've ever been this aggressive towards her... if she got on my case about anything else i was going to walk... i think she figured me out, she'll push me to the edge but not over, so i'm just really pissed off at her but she won't follow through so i can fucking scream in her face & quit... i am really growing to hate her... i only really hate 2 people in this world but there's room to add a third to the list... 

well i feel a little better now that i've vented but i'm still pissed... maybe i'll cast a hex on her or something... but knowing my luck it'll all come back on me & i'll be stuck there forever being her slave... i'd sooner kill myself...

"event","Scar Tissue

The heart breaks
allowing emotion,
in the form of tears,
to come flowing from
a seemingly strong man.
Even those
possessing the greatest
inner strength can
faulter and break down.
Many events of
great tragedy and sorrow
come to pass
during our short lifetimes.
Losing one you love
cuts deep, eventually
it will heal but
the scar tissue will
forever remain.

Pap is gone... Dec 5th he passed... my birthday was 2 days ago & his is coming up in about a week... the day before he died dad, my sister & i & some other relatives were over visiting pap... he was sleeping & everyone knew the time would be soon... he got this surge of energy & wanted to sit up, so my gram & uncle sat him up & everyone was like this is a good sign, but in my sister & i's hearts we knew it wasn't... dad went over & put a hand on his knee & was talking to pap a little & then dad lost it & ran out to the garage... in all my 22 years i've never seen my dad cry until that day... which just started a chain reaction because my sis & i looked at each other & ran out after him bawling... we hugged him & must have cried together for what seemed like 5 minutes... i don't ever want to see my dad cry again... just picturing it in my mind brings back all those feelings & i just want to start bawling all over again... the next day i was at work & my sister called me, while i was working the main register no less, & i just started crying & shaking... i knew that the time would come but i wasn't ready for it to be that day... i called up Adam & he got me another cashier & i ran to the back & locked myself in the office & cried... after about 10 minutes i went back up front to ask if i could leave & Karen said just to go & not worry about anything... i left... i stopped quick at Jason's work to let him know that it had happened & that i'd be staying at grams with my sis that night... when i finally got to gram's, pap's body was still there... crystal said that gram just wouldn't let go of him... she'd been like that for over an hour... cry wasn't there when it happened but dad was & he called her & she flew back there... there was a lot more crying & between my sister & i we really didn't let gram out of our sight... that was the longest day of my life, and the shortest of paps... i know that it's all for the best because he was suffering a lot... he had stomach cancer & they thought through chemo they got it all but it came back a lot worse... pap was tired of treatment & tired of being sick all the time from it, so he just gave up getting better & just lived out his days... when i knew that pap was getting really bad i made a decision... pap has played in a lot of bands & i never got to hear him play, well over last summer he was up & playing again (i didn't know this at the time)... well my sis said that we were gonna go somewhere & Jason wouldn't come along it was just the girls... knowing my sis i'm thinking we're going to the sex shop or a strip club but she take me to the VFW & pap is playing... i was soooooooo excited that i was finally gonna get to hear pap play... well they were playing & gary was singing & then my sister says look who's singing & i looked over & it was pap... i almost started crying... i was sooo happy... so once pap got really sick i decided that i had to have a tattoo of his guitar on my back with ""Pap"" underneath it... now i just need to figure out who i trust to do this... this will be my first major tattoo... my little blue flame was nothing... so that is how i'm going to remember my pap...

"event","well last night at work, honestly i didn't do jack-shit. i wasn't feeling very well due to my emotional state so i kinda plugged through the first part of the day & then after Adam left & i finished getting the defectives on the truck to go back to the warehouse i decided to put a small patio table together & then an adirondack chair. well i haven't finished the chair yet. all i have to do is bolt the back to the arms & a brace to the front & then it's done. but Linda & i got to talking at like 8:15 after i did a refund & i stayed up there until 8:50 & then locked the doors early. no one was in there & i just didn't feel like having anyone else either. <p> around 4:45 (i think) Missy called me & said that they were taking her dad to the hospital because he was having chest pains & he's all full of fluid & stuff. so all night i'm worrying about that & stuff & i called her & left a message around 7:30 & then called again at 9:00 or so. she answered & said that they were keeping him over night & waiting for blood work to come back & getting an x-ray of his chest & something else but i can't remember. so that's making me worry & all. then i get a text message from Pew. i told him i wasn't having a very good day & he said neither was he. so he brought me some hot chocolate & we talked for about 10 minutes then i had to get back in the store. i called him at 10 & we talked for about 7-8 minutes. it was just nice getting to talk to him. when we're alone he'll open up more than if we're out with our friends. but i hope we'll get more time to talk & stuff in the near future. i was gonna get on-line last night & IM him & talk more but i got a shower & then did some homework & started my test. i did feel a little guilty not getting on but i really didn't have the chance. so i text him & let him know i was sorry & i told him i'd e-mail him this morning. (which i still need to do) well i'm gonna finish up on here & head to work a little early so i can stop & get some french vanilla cappuccino. i'm addicted to coffee again & hot chocolate. (damn Missy & her bad habits, LOL) alright late ~Karen"

Luka is watching the cars outside through the window. i'm having Missy get me an enrollment application & financial aid paperwork for Penn Tech. i'm gonna talk to Karen about it today when i go in today. i don't really wanna say i'm depressed i'm just still on an emotional roller coaster. <p> i want my freedom. & i know what tattoo i'm getting in a few months after all this settles down & i'm kinda back into a routine. i'm going to get a butterfly on my upper arm & under it i want it to say ""Fly Free"". so it will always remind me to never compromise who i am for someone else & to always keep myself happy. i thought about that last night while i was laying wide awake in bed. my sister said that i would feel it in my heart if it was time to move on. & mom told me that no matter what i feel i've gotta stick by my decision. i've gotta grow some balls & stand up for myself. i can't let someone else run my life. i've gotta get control & live my life for me & only me. <p> like i know that i wanna travel. i don't wanna move away i just wanna travel. like Missy, Sarah & i all wanna go down to Florida to see our friend Josh who moved down there senior year. & i wanna go out to Wisconsin & visit my friend John (who wrote & published a book) & i also would like to return the courtisy that Sniper has shown to me by driving down to visit him since he's been up here to see me twice already. i want to spend more time with all of my family & i kinda feel like i'm being held back from them. i want to spend time with my niece & i want to spend time with my sister. i really want to spend time with my newest nieces (Autumn & Abigial). and i can't imagine not seeing my friends. i told myself after high school we wouldn't lose touch & we'd still spend time with each other. i've lost that factor & i want to get it back. <p> my sister told me that my body is my temple & that i should worship it with all that i am & do to it what i see fit. & honestly after she said that i was truly considering shaving my head again & piercing my chin & of course getting my tattoo. <p> well i feel a little better after getting some more of my thoughts out into the open. i've got some more things to get done around the house so i'll write more tonight if i have time, or tomorrow morning. ~late~"

well i have to get ready for work but i'll comtinue this either tonight or tomorrow morning.

<p>
i can't wait until she get de-clawed!! it's like $82 but it'll be worth it... it will save my arms & chest... she keeps getting worse with her scratching & biting... the biting is the worst but she hangs on with her claws so it really sucks... pretty soon everyone at work will think that i'm a cutter, it's that bad... right now she's acting all sweet & licking my hand as i'm typing... what a suck up... but i guess i still love her... i think she'll also settle down once we get her fixed, which isn't until December but who knows... she's watching the screen as i'm typing, she must know it's about her...

i got to watch Autumn & Abby last night for about an hour & a half... it was cool... Autumn was quiet & so was Abby until about 10 minutes before her Mommy came home... we watched The Incredibles... then when Mandy came home (around 9:30PM) we talked until Adam came home & i never got home until 12:20AM.. but i had a lot of fun talking to Mandy & stuff... i learned a lot about her & the family...

it still sucks... while i was on my week vacation we lost another person... we're down to 15 associates (including me)... but we just hired 3 new people... hopefully they'll last more that 2 weeks... Karen goes on vacation the week of the 16th YAY!! <p>

<b>July 30th</b> was our Assistant Managers last day (Dave the newest one)... he left for NY to start a new life with his wife & kids... we are currently still looking for a replacement<p>

<b>August 12th</b> i got a car!!!! it's a 91 Buick Skylark, white (not crazy about white but it'll get painted eventually), it has 58,000 miles on it... drives very nice... i'm very happy with it... i have a loan out for 3yrs @ $104 a month... which is good for me & it'll establish me credit since i have NONE!!! Jason still hasn't said too much about it... but we were up to park the Nissan at his grams & she was saying about giving more that getting in a relationship & how this wouldn't screw up us getting a house & how everything works out & stuff like that... she's a really nice lady, and not just because she's kinda on my side but because she's old & she's looking out for the younger generation & that sort of thing & she knows a lot about life and different situations...<p>
<b>August 14th</b> i finally shaved my head... all of my hair is gone... i have about 1/8th of an inch if that... and i love it!! but i do not think it has fully hit me yet... we only have 3 mirrors in the apartment... 1 in the kitchen & 2 in the bathroom & every time i go to look i still kinda hesitate & then i'm like oh it's me that's right... i didn't cry yet or anything... <p>
well that's about it for updates... i'm going into work in a couple of hours so i will go feed all my critters & play some PS before i have to leave... late..."

well that's enough fun for now!! i'm gonna go back to looking up tattoos & stuff... i've found a lot of really sweet butterflies & such... i really think that's what i'm going to get, probably either on my hip or on my right shoulder blade... i'm kinda aiming for my shoulder blade because i will be able to have it exposed until it heals so there will be less of a chance of color rubbing off... when i got my first tattoo there was a little bit of rubbing off of color, which i still need to get touched up... i got it 3 yrs ago as a graduation present... <br>
well late..."

"event","the past few days i've been having bad dreams about people that i went to school with... mostly about the people that i didn't like or were mean & snobby to others... this morning (about the last 3 hours) i had a <b>really nasty</b> one... the last thing that was happening was.........<br>
i was in this house w/ Sarah & a couple other people i didn't know/recognize & her ex was coming through the front door w/ a type of crossbow... i stepped in the doorway so he couldn't get through & he pointed it straight at me & i said ""go head and do it""... he just shook his head & lowered it... so i went in between the wall & the door as kind of a shield... & when i did he hit me in the gut with the butt of the cross bow... i didn't double over but it did hurt... then Sarah hugged him & told him to stop... i was really confused so i just kinda smiled & patted her on the ass with a small plastic pipe... then this asshole that we graduated with was sitting on a chair watching this & he told me to stop it or he'd shove something up my ass... i spun around, got right in his face & told him if he even <b>tried</b> to do anything to me he would regret it deeply... that's when a golden retriever came up to the door & wanted outside... so i let it out with a shrug... then that guy said something to my ex that was sitting beside him & they both laughed & i just gave them both a death stare... <br>
needless to say when my alarm went off i was more than ready to kick some ass... i'm just glad Jason wasn't here to wake me up or he would've gotten hurt... i was sooo pissed off when i woke up... i think i hit <b>snooze</b> like 3 times just to see if i did kick that guys ass... but i never went back to dream world... nothing that i can think of could be triggering these dreams... i haven't seen any of these people except Sarah's ex since graduation... and i just don't feel that seeing Sarah's ex would trigger something that he had such a small part in... the beginning of the dream was really weird too... in a nutshell i was over at my other mom's house (i have like 10 mom's **smiles**) and i had to tow like 4 cars, that were exactly the same car, over to my momma's house... and i was in a truck with a guy that i've never seen before... but he was really nice... he really helped me out with the vehicles... bah... stupid dreams... i want my normal dreams back... the ones with vampires and zombies... <br>
well i just had to get that outta my head... Adam & Mandy went to the dr yesterday to see what sex the baby is... i didn't get a phone call last night, but i work with Adam today so i'll ask him as soon as i see him... i've also been depressed lately... not sure why... just wanted to add that before i go get some work done... late..."

"event","this summer i have decided that i am getting my right cartilage pierced at a piercing shop, probably 16g and i am also going to get my left cart. stretched to match it... then i'm gonna get my first lobe holes stretched to probably 18g... this all was just decided w/i the past 15 minutes... i am also going to get another tattoo... last night Jason was looking at me & i said ""what?"" & he said ""nothing i'm just looking at your ears."" he said something like i took out my r. cart. but then he was like no you don't have it done... (actually i did have it done 2 summers ago but it got infected so i took it out & let it grow shut again) that's when i told him that i was getting it done again this summer at a piercing shop & about stretching my other cart... i haven't told him about stretching my lobes yet because i just decided that... he doesn't know about the tattoo either... he's not too keen on them but he's not gonna stop me... he may suggest a smaller size but he said he won't STOP me... which is really great because a while ago when i got my first tattoo (3yrs ago as a graduation gift) he really didn't like it... after it healed over he would scratch at it trying to get it off (which it didn't do any damage because it was already healed completely over)... but it really bothered me that he didn't like it... now he's better about it... he hasn't mentioned anything about it in like a yr... now i'm sure that he's gonna be a little difficult about it when i tell him that i'm getting another one but oh well... i'm not sure what yet... i'll have to look when i go up to get my piercing... i'm gonna try to save up the $$ so i don't have to pull out of my savings... <br>
also we were talking about a house last night (building one)... we're going to a lumber company tomorrow after work & look at building plans... he says by fall we should have a house... so i'm gonna try to pick up any extra hours that i can at work (w/o going over 40) & he said that overtime at the factory should start very soon... which he's not happy about but the $$ will be a lot better... <br>
well i've gotta get ready to go... maybe i'll write more tonight when i get back from work... late!!"

"event","well i had to work 12-8 today... but it was a REALLY GOOD day!!! we had truck to unload & ticket & i was actually allowed to be lead!! we got it unloaded on time & we even got it ticketed w/ 3hrs left on our shift!!! Karen was EXTREMELY happy about that... it totally made her day... plus i got my yearly evaluation done & it also was REALLY GOOD!!! Karen said that w/ all the stuff i've had to learn in the past yr & all the responsibility i took on she was very proud of me... plus she's going on vacation the week of April 10th... so i'll have a week vacation from her... which sounds bad & she really isn't as bad as she may sound but she has her days & we all need a vacation from her sometimes... i plan on taking my vacation soon too... i really NEED it!!! so now w/ Dave here (new Assistant Manager) i won't have to be management as much... i'll still be doing some of the paperwork & responsibility but i won't have to keep track of the associates as much... i'll still be making sure that they are doing work & stuff but i won't get in trouble if they don't get stuff done... it's gonna be a breath of relief...
<br>
i need to go to the chiropractor... i loved working on truck but it did a number on my back & hips... 
<br>
i got my fabric for my ""rice packs""... i'm going to mom's tomorrow to pick up my AVON & see if they turn out right... next week i work Mon-Fri... Tammy (associate) has off Sat. as well & since i kinda ditched her tonight i told her that we'd get together & do something Sat.... her best friend hasn't seen her in like a month & when she does see her, she has her bf with her & Tammy doesn't like Amanda's bf... so basically when Tammy isn't working or going to school she's at home w/ her boyfriend (Aaron ex-Assistant Manager) & she just needs to get out & be w/ a friend... so i'm gonna take her out or something Saturday... she deserves it... she's also trying to get a job at TJ Maxx (clothing store closer to her house & her school) it sounds really good for her, so i hope she gets it... she should know on Monday if she got it or not...

well i'm gonna go wind-down from work by playing Diablo II for a little while, then go to bed... late..."

"event","well Adam & Mandy didn't find out what sex the baby is yet... he said the baby had it's legs crossed & it's knees up... so now we have to wait until April 12th, which is ok because that is the day that my 4th Merry Gentry book is released & my copy will be sent out!!! i've been waiting for this day ever since i heard that there would be another book & now i'll get 2 surprises on that day!! <br>
i'm having my female days now... OH THE PAIN!! it really sucks... last night was really bad... i looked for our ""rice pack"" that Jason's mom gave us a while ago & i couldn't find it!! we put it in the microwave & it's a heating pad type thing... turns out that it's just rice in a soft cloth... **shrugs** hell if i knew!! so now that i cannot find it i'm gonna make some... i'm also gonna make one for Mandy & my sister & Missy & Sarah & i'll probably make one for Lisa as well & send it over if she ever gives me her ADDRESS!!! GRRR!!! <br>
<b>Update on Sarah's Condition:</b> <br>
SHE GAINED 12lbs!!!!! but she has scar tissue building up on some of her reproductive organs (i'm not sure which ones) but the doctor said that if she ever wanted to have children they would have to go in & remove the scar tissue just to make sure that everything would go alright... but she's still in good spirits & she's been going over to Tim's (her boyfriend) quite a bit so she must be feeling better (lol)...<br>
well i'm gonna head out to Wal-mart & get some different fabrics to make my rice packs... then it'll be off to work **growls**... it's truck day & i'll have to stock food & other stuff... but we're having 2 meetings today... 1 before truck which is w/ all associates & then 1 around 3:00 for Management, which Karen would really like to have me in on... she & i were talking for about an hr yesterday about stuff that she found out at her Store Managers Meeting Wednesday... Adam & Dave will have a meeting at the end of April to go to & then Karen has another 1 a couple days after theirs...

<br>
she also mentioned about being lonely... she's over in Iraq right now... that broke my heart as well... this woman is one of my best friends... as i sit here typing this; as i live & breathe, i love this woman... she mentions being lonely & wanting someone to hold & be with & just lay & watch a movie with... & all i can think of is holding her & telling her that everything will be alright... but i can not do that... i want to break down & just cry whenever she says stuff like that...

MAN.) was sitting at the desk & he asked me what was wrong & i told him that Ivan had died... he said that he was sorry & then he handed me a card from his wife, daughter & him... it was even a HALLMARK card!! **soft smiles** i told him that Ivan was in the freezer & he just laughed... i didn't get done what i wanted to at work today... i started setting a new plan-o-gram & then realized that i had everything on the WRONG side so i had to switch it over in like 30 minutes & that was a lot of shit to changed, i didn't even get it finished... so hopefully Karen won't be pissed about it... at least i cleaned up my mess before we left... <br>
other than that nothing much else has happened... just another day gone by... i still feel a bit depressed about Ivan & just life in general... just having a bad few days... hopefully Easter will perk me up, since i do not have to work it i'll be able to go to mom's for our meal & then just relax the day away... well i'm gonna turn in 'early' (2330)... late..."

my fish are being dumb right now... i swear the one iridescent shark is addicted to AIR!! he keeps coming up to the surface, getting a mouth-full of air & then diving back down... i know he gets a mouth-full because as he's going back down there is a large bubble that floats back up to the surface... dumb fish... but they are very entertaining... they help to calm me down at times... we have 3 tanks... 5gal which has <b>MY</b> 3 gold barbs in it, that sits on the kitchen counter so i can watch them while i cook or do dishes... 10gal which has guppies in it & also our smallest pleco, we call him Buddy... last time we counted there were 15 guppies but i don't know anymore... & our 29gal which has 5 tiger barbs, 3 iridescent sharks & our 2 larger plecos, Ivan & Plecosaur... we only named them because we can easily tell them apart...<br>

"event","watching Family Guy again... i have my stuffed baby white tiger on my lap... the momma is laying beside Jason on the floor... i had a really bad fucking day at work... i don't wanna talk about it... let's just say that when i went in at 0700 & read the note on the desk i cried... i was soo upset i actually cried... those who know me, know that i RARELY cry... & i never cry at work... well after crying i was just totally pissed off the entire day... so i decided when i got home at 1600 we were going to Red Lobster... i think after the shit i went through i deserved it... maybe tomorrow i'll go to the liquor store & pick something up...<br>
(10 minutes later)<br>
anyway all day i have just wanted to cuddle something... as soon as i got home at 1600 i got my baby kitty from off the bed... i had to leave her on the bed while i showered but then after i dried off i curled up in bed with her while my hair dried... she's my favorite stuffed animal... Jason got me the mother & baby for christmas & i love them very much...<br>
well time for bed... gonna curl up with my kitty... late..."

"event","last night i was on the internet & i was going through my e-mail & watching Family Guy & i wanted to do so many things... i wanted to read more of my Laurell K Hamilton novel i'm currently on, i wanted to start rereading the Merry Gentry series, i wanted to reread a novel that a friend of mine wrote & got published, i wanted to write in my journal(my physical one, not this one)... i wanted to do so many things, but all i ended up doing was screw around on the computer & then crawl into bed where i laid wide awake thinking about all the novels i wanted to read or reread... somewhere between midnight & 0100 i fell asleep & had a really fucked up dream... it was about people i had graduated with & also my family... i was very confused when i awoke... <br>
well today is the first day i get to work with Adam... he comes in at 1200... i'll get to see him for 3hrs!! i haven't seen him for over a week... <br>
well i guess i better feed the fish & then get to work... late..."

"event","after taking Jason lunch i took the back road home... it is about 15mins longer than it usually takes me to get home... to some it is a waster of gas but i needed the country scenery to help me clear my head... to help me rationalize a few things... i was mostly thinking about Sandy's loss... i still haven't shed my tears about it... i am going to mom's soon to take over clothes & make cookies... i'll talk to her & hopefully let it out... i need to get it out... it's stressing me, just because i couldn't be there & help soften the blow... my rationalization of the situation was that there was something wrong with the child that threatened her physical body & the child itself... so rather than risk severe damage to either person, her body rejected it... that is what i came up with... now i just have to convince myself that it is true... since i am not a person of faith i really cannot say that it was any type of higher power..."

"event","well i got to see 2 very wonderful people... i went to drop off an AVON(yes i'm an AVON lady, lol) order at a friend of the family's house & she said that her sister & bro-in-law were coming up & should be there soon... i decided to stay since i didn't have to leave for work for a while... i haven't seen them in almost a whole year!! i was soo happy when they got there!! we didn't get to talk for long but it was great seeing them!! that made my day... but i also got very bad news while i was over there... Sandy (their daughter) who has an almost 2yr old, was pregnant... i found out about 3 weeks ago... well she lost it... she was 3 months along... it broke my heart... i almost started bawling right there, but i composed myself so not to upset anyone else further... i still haven't let it out yet... but i can still feel the pain inside... she did have trouble with her first child though... they aren't really sure what went wrong but i guess she's taking it as best as could be possible... she's going back to work tomorrow i think... i want to express my sympathy but i also don't want to dwell on it... i think i'll send her an inspirational card... i think it would be better than a sympathy card... guess i'll have to go to HallMark today... well i suppose i better get around... a shower & getting ready on my day-off should help lift my spirits... i actually get to dress like a girl... YAY!! i may be a cold-hearted person but i still like to dress like a girl on my days-off... **soft smiles** maybe i'll write more... late..."

"event","i am honestly amazed at how much mucus the human nose can actually produce in one day... i have continued to blow my nose like all day & it is still stuffy... at work i felt like total shit... i got a headache & then i got cramps (i really hate being female every month)... well i took 3 advil liquid gels for my head... it went away in about 20 minutes... i just took 2 nyquil so i will be tired in about 30 minutes hopefully... and i'll actually be able to go to sleep when i crawl into bed... a lot of people at work tell me that nyquil doesn't work for them, but i thankfully have no problem with it... <br>
work went alright, except for feeling like shit... we got all of the freight out that needed to go out on the floor... thankfully for that... i also got everything done that i needed to do... it was a fairly busy night... <br>
right now i'm reading Lisa's Diary... i've been reading it from back in 2001 when she started it... i still have a bit yet to read but it is just sooo enlightening... i've learned many things about her that i did not know... i've cried while reading a few of them... what can i say, i love her to death & reading about stuff that hurt her, it hurts me also... i cried for 2 days straight about one event in particular... luckily i had Jason to comfort me & tell me that she was alright now... if it wasn't for him i do not know what i would have done... <br>
i've been thinking a lot about my novel i'm writing... also just about short little blurbs i come up with... i would really like to finish my novel but at the moment i do not have the physical energy nor the time to do so... not to mention i cannot get to my desk at the moment... i really have to clean the apartment... we've started cleaning the kitchen a few days ago but we've lost the ambition... <b>OH...</b> and speaking of the apartment, they're raising our rent!! $25!! they said because the water & heat went up, but <b> i think</b> the reason they are raising it is because their granddaughter is living next to us & she doesn't pay rent... so i believe they are raising our rent to make up for her not paying... now i know she mentioned to me that she was going to try & pay sometime but i don't believe she has yet... they aren't raising it until May but still!!! it kinda pissed me off... so we're gonna start looking for a house again... *sigh* <br>
well i suppose i will continue my reading of Lisa's Diary & then head to bed...late..."

i woke up this morning at 0900 & my throat was swollen & my nose was completely stuffed... I AM OFFICIALLY SICK..... AGAIN!! and i have to work on truck when i go to work... my head feels like it weighs 20lbs... at least my stomach doesn't hurt from cramps (point for me)... i just feel really drained & achy...<br>
my dream was completely out of whack!! surprisingly no vampires in it, like usual... they are my <b>normal</b> dreams... this one was definately odd... i remember there was a woman in it, dressed in a flowing dress, i remember it was purple with ivory accents on it & she was on a mountain that you could see from the house that we were in... i've never been in that house before so i don't know where it came from... there was also a castle type building on the mountain... i was with Jason (bf) & i don't remember being told but i just knew that i couldn't get to this woman... everytime i looked out the window, through binoculars and everytime i looked she was in a totally different place in the castle... i couldn't follow her movements... it was like she disappeared & then reappeared on a totally different level of the castle... very confusing... after a while of scouting out the castle, my parents were suddenly in the house & total me that Sarah was coming for dinner... Sarah is one of me best friends... that's all i remember...<br> 
then i got an e-mail from Lisa!!! she's another of my best friends... she's over seas right now!!! i miss her so much!!! thoughts of her make me smile!! i love you Lisa!!!"

Autumn was <b>sooo</b> happy we gave them one... she's really gotten attached to me... she even <b>hugged me!!</b> she's just so cool... & i've told Adam how blessed he is to have her... and he knows it...<br>
the past 2 weeks i've been keeping late hours... granted i've been working until 10PM but i haven't been going to bed until after Midnight... and then trying to get to sleep is a whole different problem... and then in the morning i do NOT want to get up for work or even on my day off to get chores done around the house... but for some reason this morning when the alarm went off at 8:45 i just got up... very unusual... i just got up, feed the 3 fish tanks & got on here... and i don't really feel all that tired... **shrugs** oh well i guess...<br>
i've been very anxious to play Diablo II (Expanded Version) for PC, but my PC is a <b>P</b>iece <b>O</b>f <b>S</b>hit!! we're waiting to get a newer one... better for gaming & also for our home-based business... but that all costs $$... $$ that we do not have... of course... well i'm gonna work on some stuff... late!!"

"event","<p>So I got a phone call yesterday afternoon from the sbux manager in the North Shore Mall. (which is in the same road, just right before the other sbux). Seems that the reason Chris has been ignoring me is Bc he passed me off to the mall sbux & the manager there ha just forgotten to call me. <br>So basically I got passed off to another store. Pissed me off until David suggested that Chris was intimidated by me. I must have interviewed too well & he didn't want anyone vying for his job. I didn't/don't want his job, I just want a job!!<br>Now- just hypotheticaly- if the mall sbux needs something in management/shift leading, I will be glad to take it, its just not what I'm LOOKING for. <br>My interview is at 1. Here's hoping I finally get a job. </p><p>Since I brought up yesterday, it was a really good day, despite the pouring rain. </p><p>We slept a little late (but we didn't go to bed till after 2am!!) & instead of having breakfast at home, we went to Salem. <br>We went to the Lobster Shanty & had whole lobsters. FOR BREAKFAST. Well, it was breakfast for us, but it was 1pm. The lobsters were $22/each & the sides were $4/each. David had onion rings & I had wilted spinach w/bacon. So, each plate cost us just $26!! It's the first seafood I've had since moving up to New England!! <br>After breakfast we hit up a few of the touristy stores in Salem, in the pouring rain. <br>We got my niece (who will be SIXTEEN Tuesday) a tshirt that has 'Salem MA' & a pentagram on it, for her bday present. I'll mail it tomorrow, it will be late, but she'll get it eventually.  We went in a few new age stores, only one I liked (it had the incense I wanted!!). We hit up the candy store. We got truffles, a cashew turtle, & the amazing caramels (made in Montana of all places). <br>Then we left the touristy part of Salem & went to target, petsmart & market basket (we've been told there's a market basket in Peabody, but it's easier & less traffic to drive 5 mins to Salem). I mainly went to market basket Bc I wanted more vegan sour cream & they were out last time I went. They were out again & it seems like they won't be getting any more. (what's mashed potatoes w/o sour cream??!) So, we went to Trader Joe's to see if they had any. They don't carry vegan sour cream... (*sigh* We might have to make the 40 min drive to the Whole Foods)<br>We did get at TJ'S tho, dairy-free ice cream sandwiches & chocolate covered sunflower seeds!! <br></p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>Let me begin by saying that I KNOW I'm a terrible blogger. I think it was August since I posted last??<br>Seasons & holidays have come & gone since then. <br>This year has been a year of changes. </p><p>The first few weeks in February, David flew to Woburn, MA to interview for 2 poss promotions. One was in Woburn, the other was in AUSTRALIA. He didn't get either position. People in house got both. After getting over the fact that we were to be stuck in Dublin, GA indefinitely, things began to settle down. Besides, everything I've ever known is in GA. Change is scary. (Esp the possibility of moving to a continent where every living thing could kill you.) <br>A month went by before we found out that even tho he didn't get the position he interviewed for, the company still wanted David in Woburn. Which meant moving to MA. They transferred him from a 'user services' position (basic customer service with little to no tech support) to tech support. He was to be in the Woburn office & working by May 7. <br>Every year the company has a big party/team building/meeting in different vacation spots. Last year they went to DISNEY WORLD. This year, they saved a lot of $$ & sent everyone to Foxwoods (a casino/resort in CT). David flew up to Woburn the weekend before the big weekend get-together to look for/pay down on a place to live & get some in-house training.  <br>We found an apartment (that's actually a condo), that the owner was looking to rent out. (she's getting a divorce & moving to Fla of all places) In all my initial emails when looking for a place, I always included the fact that we had 2 indoor cats that were our kids & we would not be moving without. Thankfully, the condo complex allows pets & our landlord has a kitty of her own & was perfectly cool with our boys. <br>So, we packed up everything (while David was still in Woburn) & got things ready to move. <br>After a 26 hour drive (with the boys in our car, which was on a trailer, hooked up to the back of the rental truck), we made it to our new home in Peabody (pronounced: Pbiddy), MA by May 2. -sn: my dad & brother flew up the next day to help us unload & unpack. Honestly, I think their presence made the transition to being 26 hrs away from my home & family a LOT easier.- <br>David is now just a 20 min drive from the office & we're living in a (not really all that little) town that reminds me a lot of East ATL, just w/o all the artsy-hippy-scene stuff. <br>I love the fact that most everything around us is locally-owned & mostly w/in walking distance. I LOVE THAT SALEM IS 5 MINS DOWN THE ROAD. <br>I was really expecting everything here to be so expensive, but really it's not & something's are cheaper. Gas is about the same. We found a grocery store that's cheaper than Kroger (even after my emp discount), there's no tax on groceries, and reg sales tax is just 6.25% for everything else. The thing that is a big monetary adjustment is rent. We're literally paying 4x as much as we were in Dublin. You have to take the bad with the good tho, right??</p><p>I was not able to transfer with sbux, so I had to just quit. So far, I am still unemployed. <br>I interviewed for a sbux that's just 2 miles down the road, but I think I totally blew it. The manager has been avoiding my calls too, so I dunno....   :(<br>I guess it's time to start over. There's a million & one local biz just on our street alone, I guess I can start 'pounding the pavement'. <br>We've been surviving, it would just be nice to not have to worry about being able to buy food Bc we need to have enough $$ to be able to pay $1200 in rent. Plus, I'm starting to get cabin fever, being cooped up in the apartment (& I say 'up' Bc we're on the 1st floor, which is NOT ground floor) with the boys. </p><p>This is where we are right now. <br>It's only just now June. </p><p>I think it's time to go downstairs & check the mail, it's been over a week since I got a letter. I should be due one soon...</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","So saturday was our 6 year anniversary.
Friday was Rowan's 4th heaven anniversary.
Today is the last day of my 4 days off.

I left thursday @ 8pm & have to be back in the am @ 5:30...

Friday I spent the morning crying, but after I got myself outta bed, it was a pretty okay day. I don't think any of the kids are getting balloons this year, unless I decide like somewhere btwn Yerik & Aidan's bday to get all 3 of them one to put on their tree.

Saturday we went to our aquarium. It's been here (in ATL) since '05, but we just haven't been to see it. It's the largest in the states, & also the only (man-made)home to whale sharks. We got there super early (like 30 mins b4 they opened) so we walked around the park they made to commemorate the '96 olympics. There was also some sort of road race that had just ended, so there were tons of ppl still milling about (also they had roads blocked off. Like the roads the gps told us to take we couldn't). 
If the aquarium is the largests in the states, it seemed kinda small. Maybe it's largest in gallons of water used & not square feet?? 
It was divided up into different sections, cold water, river, coral reef, ocean, ect.
Of course I was there for the penguins, so we hit the cold water exhibit first. As much as a penguin fanatic as I am, Id never seen them in person before..  I could have moved into that exhibit!!
I had been told that there was a tunnel that put you under their enclosure, & that there were little holes you could put your head into that put you at eye-level with the penguins. Yes, there was, but I didn't pop me head thru the holes.. bc what they didn't tell me was that at the end of the tunnel was floor to ceiling under water, meaning that the tunnel ended right in the their water & the roof of the tunnel was the land part of their space. So I sat at the water (I bc they just opened for the day, the workers still had stuff to do, & a girl was cleaning the glass of their cage, from the inside) & watched them all swim around, basically right over my head. As if I wasn't before, I am now totally, hopelessly, madly, deeply in love with penguins.
I really really wanted to squeeze them ALL!!!
The coral reef was alright, if you've seen one, you've seen them all.David kept fussing at me for watching the diver clean the reef more than watching the fish - - but he was fascinating!!  lol

There was a 'Georgia Explorer' part that basically was a touch & play area. There was several touch pools (rays, baby sharks, horseshoe crabs, brown shrimp, starfish, urchins..ect) & a indoor playground type shindig.

As much as I love penguins, I think my fave area was the river one. No I don't really care about the animals there (catfish-tasty!, frogs, snakes, ALBINO ALLIGATERS!!, Crunchies- err, algea eaters, sorry) but I loved the way it was designed. All the walls looked like tree trunks & all the tanks had logs in them. Also - the river flowed over head!! That was brilliant. It made you feel like you were walking in the bottom of the river. Maybe it's just bc I live in the south & I'm quite familiar with rivers (but the exhibit in the aquarium is as close as I want to get to being in one).
Of course, the ocean part was the 'main attraction' bc that's where all the big creatures are. They have a half-acrylic tunnel that takes you int o the tank, so everything swims over your head. My favorite aquatic animal is a ray, & this exhibit did not disappoint!! Manta rays, sting rays, rays I'd never seen before & can't remember the name of... 
David loves the whale sharks..  I'm sure it's just bc theyre SO BIG..  This aquarium has 4, that are just babies (& 30 ft long!!), but they have the room to house 6 full grown ones (@ 70 - 80 ft long). 
I took lots of pictures, but the 2ft acrylic keeping all the millions of gallons of water from killing us all made most of them blurry. *shrugs* I DO have some good ones from inside the acrylic tunnel, but of the whale sharks, all I could get were their shadows..
We left @ 11;30. There were SO MANY PEOPLE waiting to get in. Actually, when we left at 11:30, they were at capacity & everyone waiting outside were told it would be 12 be fore they even started selling tix again. ..crazy..

Bc we got up at 5:30 to be on the road by 6, we were exhausted. We planned on just coming home & eating here, but we got stuck in traffic for almost a hour, so we hit up the QT (Quick Trip, it's the is fucking amazing gas station. I stopped counting pumps after 30. Their food is great & super cheap..  A 32oz fountain drink for 59cents?? Why yes we're getting slushies!!). An anniversary lunch for under $6! 

We got home around 3, & took a nap!!

Last night we had some friends from outta town come over. She has a huge crush on me & I think that freaks David out. He says he's just not into sharing..."

/hauntshit/
Last week I had to help out with a make up clalss. I am clueless about stage makeup. It was fun to play with the airbrushes.. I just don't have the refinement for free-hand.
After this weekend we should begin work on costumes again. I have finished ripping up what I have here..
The build has already started.
I was asked (by one of our makeup directors) to partake in another gross-out role. 1. I seem to have a reputation already. 2. This one actually grosses ME out. 
We'll see, like I said, I already have a rep for being ..that.. girl.
/endhauntshit/

(SN: Im watching South Park, on my own, by myself...  what is wrong with me?!?!)

We seem to have an ever-increasing German roach issue. I guess we should known there was something up with the house when we moved in, bc there were roach motels all over the house (a warning would have been nice...).
Im sure our location has something to do with it, but also, everyone puts all the dishes in the sink until I can get to them, the boys' food stays out all the time, & we leave clothes/towels on the floor.
(Of course, DAvid only got REALLY upset when the bugs got in the tv...  *sigh*)
The house will be fogged, but for the next 6-7 months, cleaning will have to be a daily thing. Sweeping, mopping, actually washing dishes, & keeping clothes off the floor. The housemate will have to be his share, but when told he just rolled his eyes & hid in his room. When he finally came out, we explained what were doing AGAIN & he was told what he could do atm to help. (this seems to be the way to get him to do anything - don't leave it up to him to find something to do or, god forbid - take it apon himself to do something, fucking TELL him what he's gonna do & stand over him while he does it)
While I was still at work, David cleaned all the counters, the pantry & the living room (vacuuming the furniture). When I got home, I cleaned the entire bathroom. On top of the toilet, sink, counters, ect I cleaned the tub, baseboards, & the walls... 
Plus I cooked dinner & finished cleaning the kitchen. 
The house IS a mess (not just clutter, but the maintenance - like cleaning the baseboards, just hasn't been done), but I can't do it all myself. I have been doing it all, esp in this house, with the housemate. As much I might try to be, I am not a superhero. Thankfully, David has realized this. He apologized again, when I told him, again, I feel as if I do everything myself.
I've worked my ass off today (& not just at work) & I'm exhausted."

Even with all my years of using LJ, I still have no idea have to make cuts, so this may seem a little long.

Wednesday, we were to have some OCD suit come inspect the store.Tuesday night, my coworker & busted our asses cleaning, like sitting on the counters cleaning plexus & standing inchairs cleaning the ceiling. Wednesday, she & I were to be working atogether again, when the suit was to arrive. It seems that that morning, our manager (you've heard me rant about her idiotness) decided to shit apon all our work from the previous night. I have no idea what they did that morning, but it was NOT cleaning...  So, my coworker & I had to reclean everything from the night b4, plus clean everything else we intended to that day. My coworker, who's usuallyu pretty laid back, was super pissed at our manager. As she was getting ready to leave for the night (I was closing), she mentioned taking out the trash for me. I told her not to worry about it, I'd take it....if I felt like it *wink*. After laughing, she told me to 'turn the other cheek'. This is (mostly) our convo that followed:

SK: Just remember to turn the other cheek.

MB: Nope, don't believe in that - it's against my religion.

SK: It's in the bible, you don't believe in the bible?

MB: Nope.

SK: You don't believe in god?

MB: Nope.

SK: Why not?

MB: B/c he doesn't exist!!

SK: You're going to hell!!

MB: That doesn't exist either!! (Except in the minds of the poor fools who believe - Sorry, those are song lyrics.)

SK: So what do you believe in?

MB: I believe in myself.

SK: ...but you have a soul..

MB: No I don't!

SK: What do you feel is your purpose - who do you live for?

MB: My life is mine & it's up to me to make it the best I can. I live for myself, & for those I love: David & my family.

SK: Do you believe there's a Satan??

MB: You're looking at her!! lol..

SK: I'll pray for you tonight.

MB: Have fun wasting that breath!!

I found the whole situation entirely too funny!! Poor girl already thinks I'm a nympho (she actually asked me once if I was a 'swinger')..  now she thinks I'm a godless heathen..  which I am!!



July is almost done..  I NEED to have another costume meeting..  maybe this saturday?? I think I""m off..
Saturday, DAvid decided he wanted to be the groom to my zombie bride (for our party this year), so I went shopping for a suit to destroy. I HATE our salvation army, BUT(!!) I found a whole suit that will fit, for >$7. I started working on it, but it's just too hot to sit under a suit for hours... 

July is almost done..  which means August comes next.. Even though our anniversary is in there, it's still not my favorite time of year... (Sat night @ work, a coworker & I had an interesting convo about my kids. It's strange to think that they would be 5, 4, & 3!!)  :(

I'm still reading Barker's Books of BLood. It's nice bc they are short stories, so I can skip around instead of reading cover to cover. ...Of course, I have like 3 other books I'm reading too..."

"event","Sorry guys, but it seems my life has once again settled into the boring teritory...

I have lost one coworker (found something better), and will be losing another next month (nursing clinicals). My hours this week have improved. I would not hire anyone else at the moment. Id just give those who's left the hours & see if they can handle them. If everyone complains about being over worked, then Id hire someone. MY boss is hiring TWO new ppl....  *sigh*

The weather here has been off-and-on stormy for the past few days. I have arthritis in my SI joints. These two combined are not a good thing.Yesterday I was so sore..
A friend came over & massaged my ass (sounds kinky, but it's not - the SI joints are where the pelvic bones meet the spine, and the pain is literally in my ass) & gave me some of her vicoprophen. Btwn the massage & sitting on a heating pad, the pain died down to just a dull ache. The drugs just made me feel puffy & fuzzy...  and ITCHY. I took a second vico to hopefully dull the pain enough to sleep, but it took me forever to go to sleep bc you can't sleep when you are scratching everything...

I slept hard. I needed it tho, I haven't been sleeping well for some reason. I had odd dreams, that were drug induced maybe?? 
I really only had sex dreams while pregnant (with the hormones & whatnot), so that's another reason my dreams were odd.
I dreamt my best friend in HS (who lives in Cali now), & I were at her house. There was something we were trying to get dressed to go to (like a costume party, maybe??), bbut we kept talking about how when we got back, we'd fuck. At some point, I kissed her, only to have her tell me I was horrible at kissing (my fears being expressed?? lol).
There are a few other little details in the dream that honestly have nothing to do with the plot...

I woke up, realized I had been asleep over 9 hours, told myself I was getting outta bed...   and then fell right back asleep.

This time I dreamt of going to disney world in order to conceive a child (bc, as I was told in my dream, what child wouldn't want to be conceived in disney world?!?). Odd, odd & odd.

Now that I am out of bed, & mostly awake, I feel hungover. I was highly medicated last night."

"event","I was texting a friend today & I realized that what I was relaying to them was, in fact, some good shit. Like any good writer should, I wrote it down. Then, like the idiot I am, thought 'why did I write all this down, I should have been TYPING IT OUT!!'.
(here's where the handy dandy keyboard comes in)
I could (& may still) use pages for this piece of my thoughts, but for now this will have to do.

Losing my last child almost 3 years ago was the beginning of the unravelling of my confidence in the religion in which I was raised. Quickly it passed from me. Working on saturday nights gave me an excuse to my parents to NOT go to church. 
After spending the last few years feeling lost & numb I've finally found an outlook which to align myself with. In this outlook, women are to present themselves the sex symbols they are.
Acting on this knowledge of how I am to behave, it's nice to see it actually works & others find me AS I am to be presenting myself..
Now, it is no longer just behavior, it is who I am.
It is who I am without the hindrances of the morality that's been forced down my throat all my life.
It's this mental & physical adjustment, along with a few other recent realizations, that give a feeling of wasted years...
Well, waste I shall no longer. 
I live my life for no one but myself, & for those I love. Far too long have I tried to force myself into being something I obviously am not to be. Yes, I still have my dreams, but sometimes dreams are just that, dreams. It's time to focus on what makes me. 
What makes me is my sexuality (with tits like these, what more could you ask for?), my art, my writing, on these shall I focus.

..yeah I could go on with this, but I'd just feel I was repeating myself. Right now I'm so tired Im sure I'd just start rewording the same five thoughts over & over."

"event","<p>Thursday. <br>Inquiring minds want me to update this more frequently. I shan't leave my fans waiting. <br>...I'll bore them to death, but they won't have to wait for it....</p><p>/hauntshit/<br>Bc I am 'costume director' & bc my haunt owner is brilliant, but scatterbrained, I am in charge of all things costumes. (We've been over this.)<br>He wants me to organize meetings to bring more ppl in to be involved with costumes. The idea being that if ppl have a vested interest, they're more likely to be involved in other things. I understand this idea, & ideally, it works. What he doesn't understand is, you're dealing with teenagers that expect everything to be handed to them. Work in order to enjoy the benefits of their playtime in the haunt?? No. <br>Case-in-point: I only have one person that has agreed to the initial meeting. A person who happens to live within walking distance from the haunt. Also a person who's leaving for college in august. She won't even be able to enjoy our playtime this year. *sigh*<br>Everyone else I've tried to contact either has changed their number, is in jail (that's a story for another day), not willing to help, or -my favorite- ""I might show up?"". <br>Also, there's a meeting next Thursday I'm expected to attend that I prob would not have found out about, had I not called him myself. Thankfully I was able to get the work schedule rearranged. </p><p>/endhauntshit/</p><p>Speaking of:<br>The store I work in (or at least the depts around me) acts like such a tight-knit community that sometimes I think ppl there forget we're a business. Just bc you don't agree with the way things are handled, doesn't make them morally wrong. Our store, like any other, has policies & practices that must be upheld. Lately, there's been a few transactions (in Starbucks alone) that have had to be investigated by loss/prevention. They were issues that the computer system itself tracked, not any outside ""he said/she said"" bullshit. The issue that was on me was easily explained. Once I explained my actions & that (as someone with management exp) I was just doing what I could to make my customer happy, I got a pat on the back & a ""good job, thanks for taking care of the cust, but, in the future..."". Over all, my experience with the whole deal was positive. When the head of your HR dept tells you passed with flying colors, then yes, it was a positive experience. Then, ive also been doing this whole retail/dealing with corporate assholes for way too long to let this sort of shit bother me. It seems tho, that I've been the only one with that sort of experience. I'm not really sure what else has been going on in my dept, but it seems my manager almost lost her job. Part of me wishes she had. I could write volumes on my issues with her management skills & the changes I'd make if her job was mine. She's still here, so I'll just continue to keep my mouth shut & do as I'm told. I just happen to be the best barista there, I'm okay with this. Do some ppl not like me bc I am?? Fuck them. They'd be the first I'd fire. <br>Actually, I hope they do leave soon. This 20-23 hrs/week isn't going to pay the bills. </p><p>I opened up my notebook yesterday & actually wrote something in it. A whole page & a half on my (unfinished, obv) opinion on women's rights. It's gonna be a long one. I'm not your typical woman. I'm okay with cleaning & cooking & making my husband happy. I'm also okay with women in power. I am one of those that needs a man to feel complete. I don't think all men are shit. I also like sex, a lot. I want it anywhere I can get it, esp under the goddamn coffee table!! (okies so that's technically not part of women's rights, but you get my point)</p><p>(he'll never read this, so I won't worry) We think our housemate is gay. He's 6'4, 300lbs of ...gay. Yeah he likes tits, but so do I. He's a virgin (so maybe he just doesn't know what he wants!! Lol), but most of-age virgins I know talk about getting laid. A lot. He doesn't talk about sex, he doesn't talk about girls, fuck he doesn't even talk about guys. All his friends are girls. He will, however, look AWAY from a victoria's secret commercial, only to turn back & comment on their hair. He talks about shoes & clothes alot as well. I'm perfectly okay with him being gay. Hell, it'd make it a lot easier if he was. We could get him outta the house for a while, make him spent time with ppl. He just doesn't talk about anything remotely romantical, either way. Sometimes it's frustrating for us, & all we do is live with him. </p><p>....my mind has started drawing blanks, so I think for now you have been sufficiently updated. </p><p>OH!! Nikki & Josh, if you guys have completely moved, I'd like your new mailing addy. You can txt me or FB msg it to me. :D</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

Never really thought I'd ever hold you this close again, sealed & signed with a kiss. </p><p>Okies so update from the land of the ever rising sun (okay, okay, from the really fucking hot south). </p><p>David is still working. They've recently changed things to where everyone will do sales, not just the sales dept. Last month he was # 4 in the company (not just the state, the company). The first weekend in June, they sent him (& the rest of his coworkers) to Orlando for a 'work retreat'. In fucking DISNEY WORLD. ...must be nice... <br>The company seems to only hire alcoholics, so he had a very exciting weekend. <br>I, on the other hand, went to Ohio that week. I've become even more involved in our local haunted house, now being their costume director. <br>It's funny, I beg for an opportunity to work with them, finally get my chance, & they fucking fall in love with me. Actually, that's not funny, I can't help the fact that I am amazing. <br>What?? Oh yeah, Ohio: my haunt sent me, the owner, & 3 other ppl to the Midwest Haunters Convention in Columbus. <br>I've had to answer the question ""what's that??"" a million times since I've been home. I thought all conventions were basically the same. There were classes & a tradeshow & .... Really it was just a big fucking party (my classes added up to a whole 3 hours). I've never had so much Coors Lite in my life. Turns out that stuff isn't so bad....</p><p>We have a month & a half to focus on costumes, make up & actor training before the build starts. Then we have to focus on all of the above. THEN the month of sept we have to focus on all of the above, just intensified (actually, I hope the costume part should be done). <br>So, yeah, costume director, just means I have a shit ton of work to do & nothing to show for it. Except for the pretty amazing costumes that will come outta it. I'm rambling now. </p><p>Right now this is what's going on. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>Okies so, w/o the app, I can't seem to post to LJ on the iPad. Weird. (at least the app was free)</p><p>today is one of this days where (why?) I understand when Christians want to read their religious texts. A day where you feel as if you are nothing on your own. Aligning myself with the teachings of LaVey, I know that I am everything, even on my own. Still, I can't help feeling like I must get my nose in a book, text, or essay. <br>I have a former friend, who's a friend of a friend, on FB. seeing her post on things, knowing she's still the selfish, religious, idiot she always has been, angers me. how can you sleep at night knowing you're still in the same place you were 10 years ago. How can you live your life following a myth, fireside folklore that's just been passed down thru the ages?? Sure, you feel that 'your god has provided this..' or, 'I wouldnt be where I am today w/o my god'. Really?? Really?? Are you sure what you have & what you've accomplished is not things you've done on your own?? B/c you're too needy to see that just b/c you've done your religious duties, doesn't mean that anything has changed in the cosmos, it just means you feel better about yourself for the time being. I understand, when you've been taught things all your life, taught that how good you feel after praying or whatnot, you just think that's truth. When you realize that everything around you is a lie, then you realize that (for instance) the reason you always feel that you must read, pray MORE is bc it's not actually getting anything done, actually. :D <br>When you realize you've devoted your life to nothingness, it makes you that eager to make up for lost time. </p><p>Now that I feel better about that. (oh & if my former friend for some strange reason ever reads this: FUCK YOU!!)</p><p>I think I'll start posting on how I (recently, perhaps) incorporate the '9 elements' into my (our) daily life. Even tho it seems I've sort of already elaborated on the last one here today. :D <br> It's so refreshing to look at things from the other side, knowing that I am no longer blindly following.  I am the one who will have ppl follow me!! If into nothing more than his own heartbreak, for weak men are beguiled by tits & red lipstick. Do what you must, to get what you must!! <br></p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

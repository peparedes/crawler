Fire show practice is fun, my arms hurt every wednesday morning but its super worth it. I have Asia's poi to play with during the week, they're a lot more effective then my sock poi! I hope I get to light up soon..=D

Ummm, let's see, laura and vic and me are joining in a new RPG on teusdays based on Dune! Tomorrow is dune mini series watching day to get ready, i'm excited. I hear the mini series is 100 times better then the movie, so I'm sure it'll be pretty good ^_^

Someone stole my laundry basket! It was alone in the laundry room between 2 am and 7 am, and it was GONE! Who steals a laundry basket?!?! Now I'm paranoid about theft, I'm not bitter about it anymore (that only lasted like an hour lol), I just need something to put my dirty clothes in....i dont wanna have to buy a new basket, maybe a storage bin? yeah, that could work.

The chess/masque/star party saturday was AMAZING, meeting everyone was so awesome. I can tell this is going to be a good group ^_^ I wish I could've gone to celebrate tylers b-day, but c'est la vie, I had made plans for that night. In any case, I hope he had a fun time =)

"event","When I hear a song I like, I don't favorite it and listen to it once in a while. Oh no. I run it into the GROUND. For WEEKS, I'll sing it, until I get sick of it one day and never want to hear it again. It's like a sickness. Songs grab at me until I hear them enough to have every note memorized.

Songs I have somehow not yet managed to get tired of yet INCLUDE: Sexy Naughty Bitchy, Gives you Hell, anything by Paramore and Love me Dead.

Biology is kicking my ass =P I'm good at math, good at almost anything in school, but this is my one weakness. Week 2 and I think I need a tutor. It makes me feel a little dumb, but I know that it's better to get help early.

It looks like the Rikku cosplay actually might happen by metro =DDDD It'll be Rikku frmo FF X, not FF XII, so I don't have to buy a wig. Medium length blonde hair finally comes in handy for a cospaly! If I get the money, I know who I want to make it for me, and it'll look super cute.

No word from Battle Con yet! I sent in my pics/info for a shot at being in their fan girls of anime calendar (Your supposed to send a pic, your age, and what character you want to portray, I said misa misa from death note ^_^). I'm sure I'll hear back from them in like 3 months when chess mania has taken over (assuming i get in *crosses fingers and prays*) and I've forgotten all about battle con. I do hope I get in though, it sounds fun and I'd love to have a calendar to show my grandkids to say 'See, this wrinkled lady WAS hot back in the day! Told ya!'. Lol jk. But I am hoping to get in.

When I go to book and music stores, I get recognized a lot from Metro. This isn't related to anything, i just think its kind of cool and fun, Ive made a few awesome acquaintences this way.

Dinner at steak and shake with chess crew made me realize how much I miss everyone. **makes mental note to hang out with and keep in touch with everyone more **

Job hunting is still sucky, but whatevs, it'll happen soon, I just have to keep trying. I'll make things work in the mean time.

For the third time in my life, metro falls training has gotten me through a bike accident. i was actually pretty proud of myself, instead of panicking, i felt zero fear and just readied myself for impact. All i got was a huge, fearsome looking scrape on my right knee, and that was a pretty decent spill onto dusty concrete. For me, stage combat training doubles as SURVIVAL training. Lol.

 I think.....I'm just not meant to ride a bike. This ones front wheel pops off, the basket came off (...after i dropped the bike...), the thing covering the chain comes undone and needs to be pushed back into place, and now the chain came off. This bike sounds so broken and such when i describe its quirks, but I've become attached. That whole chain coming off thing is a problem, though, since I can't put it back on with the protective chain cover still attached to my bike.

Zack and Miri Make a Porno is AH-mazing. Go see it if you haven't.

I'm not even sure college is right for me right now, I don't know what i want to do with my life! Who says that a college degree is ZOMGNECESSARY for a decent life? There are so many things you can do that dont need a degree. Dont get me wrong, there's a lot that you absolutely need a degree for, doctors, lawyers, engineers......I dont know, I just feel like I'm wasting time here in college with no direction. I wish I had taken a year off to figure out what i wanted to DO with my college life. Or if i even wanted to do a career that NEEDED a degree.

I guess I just want to feel like if I'm in college, I want to be working towards a goal that I need college for. Like I'm going somewhere with my degree. Which I definitely do not feel right now. I feel like I'm just wasting time and money taking classes like philosophy and english when I could be at a job, making money, and figuring out what I want to do with my life. I want to be in college going somewhere, not because it's what I'm ""supposed"" to do. My whole family is college-crazy, I imagine that I'd be DISOWNED if I wasn't here.

I'll figure it out."

But I can't be depressed. Why? Garion skipped his families thanksgiving meal to stay and bring me orange juice, medicine, and hugs. I tried to get him to leave me and see his family, but he wouldn't go when I was feeling like death. I'm blessed ^_^ 

So even in shitty health, I have things to be thankful for. Friends, family, self sacraficing and amazing boyfriend, everything. Happy thanksgiving everyone! =) Hope there was lots of turkey and pie to go around. I know my throat will never be too sore for my grandmothers pumpkin pie, or my dads brined turkey, or moms mashed potatoes."

I just know that someone's going to get a patented Liz tongue lashing. I'm betting that since mostly chesss and masque ppl know me on this LJ, they've never seen me get mad or discouraged or anything. They've read about it on LJ,m but never SEEN it. I don't tell people when I'm upset because I like to be a positive person. And I am most of the time. I'm pretty happy generally, this has just been kind of a shitty wek for me in a lot of ways. That's OK, its life and it happens to everyone.

But..........there are limits, even for me, I have those points where ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I'm like a rocket ship, it takes a LOT to get me mad enough to want to punch someone but once I get there, it's extreme. I just don't know what I'm going to do when I see this person. Being friendly is out of the question, and if I let loose talking about how I feel about them and what they do it could get ugly. Oh well. Let the ugly begin =)"

All the girls here are like six feet tall.

I'm so used to being the tall one, now more often then not I'm the smallest one on the elevator, or in the room.....it's weird, but its interesting. I've always been the thinnest, I'm not used to being one of the shortest. I am only 5'7"" though, normal height for girls goes up to 6'4"".

House Bunny is really funny. Surprisingly so. The girl who played shelley was actually doing the dumb blonde thing in a funny, cute way. I enjoyed it, so did the guys that me, jessica, and laura conned into seeing it with us >:-). Actually, we were all hanging out and just asked nicely if everyone wouldnt mind seeing house bunny, but I like the word conned better. More of an evil connotation. Mwhahaha!

I love the feeling of having new tone, new strength. It's nice. I love the crew machine, my arms arent so scrawny anymore. The fish game is totally epic. Its hard to explain.

I've taken up an RP, Mechton or something like that. I'm a Wuxian trooper, and I never knew how cool tabletop games were! Every thursday is girls night at armada games with me, laura, and vic, and we always see james and patrick there, so if anyones in the neighborhood at that time they should come hang out. It is super fun times. We play the most retarted looking games, like ""Hey, thats my fish!"" which evolved into me, laura, vic, and james yelling at each other stuff like ""I'm not fucking around with these fucking fish!!!!"". Oh, what we do to kids games.....

I'm so happy for my boyfriend! He has a job now, and a good one, so that's really cool. Our one year anniversary is in about three weeks, i still have no idea what to get him! Ahhhhh!

Metro season needs to start again. I had to write a memoir, and I wrote about metro, and it made me miss everyone all over again <3<3<3

So college is cool, but kind of boring since classes and clubs and whatnot havent started up yet. Ive been going to the week of welcome events, and theyve been ok, but life here in the USF dorms is still kind of slow. Especially in an all girls dorm, which is interesting to say the least. Id rather be in a co-ed dorm, itll be much much more relaxed, i think. All girls dorm isnt that friendly, at east my floor. Im hoping this wil change by teh end of next week, when life at USF starts going forward. FOr now, its all straightening out school issues and doing stuff.

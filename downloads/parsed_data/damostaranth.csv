"event","We understand that you are probably a busy person. Possibly a safety-conscious person. Not necessarily a hyper-organised person. 

But there is something we, the fast-food workers of the country, would like you to know.

We are being timed. And our ability in service is judged on that time. At our store, our target average is 50 seconds, which is a stepping stone to an ultimate target of 45. As some cars are unavoidably much longer than this due to large orders or unforseen issues, removing outliers the desirable time should be closer to 30 seconds. And when everything's going well, we can pull this off quite effectively. 

I know some restaurants are slow. I know that some just don't care. But for those of us that do, every second that ticks by which you spend at our window hurts our average, far and apart from holding up other customers behind you. 

Have your money ready, or at least readily accessible, when you come to the window. Sometimes you lose that one coin you needed - that's alright. Sometimes you're delivering a whole handful of change to empty your wallet out - that's okay too, we almost always could use more change. But if you're going to have to get out of the car and rummage through your trunk to find your purse, couldn't you have done that BEFORE you got to drive-through? Or heaven forfend, come in through the front?

If you don't know what you want, and want to have a long discussion with someone regarding the possibilities, do not use the drive through. Especially if your english is not great, or even if you have a strong accent. I know that sounds harsh and possibly racist, but realise that your voice is being transmitted through a speaker along with the wind and the sound of your engine and the radio and anyone else in your car for background noise, and if we can't understand you and you can't understand us then we're going to waste a lot of time failing to communicate, probably while we're trying to do other crazy things like serve other customers and keep the store organised and clean. A lot of what we do in drive-through is finding those few little syllables which correspond to a product we understand, and if you're making a complicated order when you pronounce things differently to us, we're going to have some trouble finding those hints.

Please tell us if you have any coupons or similar. Deleting and reentering meals is a task which requires manager attention in many stores, and if we enter a meal only to find that we need to re-enter it to adjust the price, it wastes your time, our time, and the manager's time.

And PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, once you have your meal, drive on. Make a cursory check to determine everything is there by all means, we're not perfect and mistakes do happen - at some places more than others, and I like to think at my restaurant less than most - but understand that while you spend time carefully putting change back in your purse, closing your purse, putting your purse in your handbag, putting your handbag carefully behind the seat - no, not there, just a bit that way, yes, that's right - distributing food amongst your children, making sure everyone's got the right thing, taking out some of the food and starting to nibble on it, putting the food in just the right place so it won't fall down, and adjusting it so you can pull some out to eat as you go, pulling your seatbelt on, readjusting the food so you can click it in, opening your drink, having a sip, then carefully closing and placing it on the cupholder...

THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOMERS WAITING, AND OUR TIMER IS TICKING. I fail my manager evaluation if that timer average goes too high. All the managers get lower bonuses, and yelled at by our bosses, if that timer goes too high. 

We don't ask much. Please be nice to your servers - it's a crap job and we're underpaid, every little bit you can do makes us happier, and happier staff are more likely to make your visit more enjoyable too.


-- This rant was brought to you by me, having watched over the course of today alone, no less than three people whose orders were less than $5, and were ready to be handed out before they reached the window, and who could have been there and gone in less than 15 seconds, nonetheless spend more than one and a half minutes parked there fiddling with the contents of their car."

"event","So, this NaNoWriMo everyone keeps talking about.

By everyone I mean one or two friends of mine who'd probably write that much anyone and one Canadian friend who uses it to turn RP transcripts into works of fiction - not half badly, but eh.

I've not done anything for it before because a) I haven't written anything not rp-related since I was about 18, and b) I tend to have exams until about halfway through November, which really tends to bugger up writing.

But this year! This year I only have exams until the 6th.

And while I still have no chance of actually producing any decent fiction work as a novel, I DO have so much bloody RP work to do it's not funny.

So this is just basically being put up because I don't want me to forget I said I'd do this. November. 50k words worth of RP posts, planning, world-building documents, and related awesome. 

...It's only like 2000 words a day... how hard can it be? >_>"

"event","Is there such a thing as preemptive procrastination?

Well I'm here at uni. I don't really have much else to do, and I don't have any homework really worth speaking of. I have a couple of RPs I need to write for, but no huge rush there. I could be doing work on other stuff, but it's not urgent. It will be, I'm sure, but...

So for some reason the need to procrastinate came to me - despite the fact there's nothing I need to procrastinate ON. So I figure I'm going to get my procrastination in EARLY, so that when the time comes that I DO need to do work, I'll have already performed procrastination and thus can get right to it.

It makes perfect sense, right?

Also, I'd like to take this moment to note that procrastination is an incredibly long word, and if I keep going on this track, I'm going to start procrastinating on writing it, so time to move on.


So. It's been 37 weeks since I last wrote an entry on LJ, according to LJ's it-has-been function, and I have no real reason to believe it doesn't know what it's talking about. I mean, there's no chance that LJ has some long-stretching grand master plan for all of our detriments... and even when it does, I can't see how misinforming us of how many weeks it has been can be useful. Of course, I can't see the big picture yet.

I am back at uni! I am currently in year five of a four year course, because a couple of years ago, I sucked at uni and filled with fail. Worse yet, I have nine subjects left to complete, at four subjects per semester. THIS NUMBER IS FULL OF FAIL AND BLAH.

However, I have no intention of failing any further. 

Mainly because my girlfriend's mother has left some wonderfully vague threats as to what might happen should I do so XD

My life is currently stretched between roleplaying, KFC, uni work and several of my friends who seem to enjoy my presence for some reason, and the concept of actually not only having a life but having enough of one that I no longer have any free time is slightly disconcerting. I may have to cut down slightly in order for success at uni to occur, but I say never. I just have to attend lectures more. At least one subject's lecturer has already made it stunningly clear that he does not believe in internet-bound lecture notes, and with some of the hardest subjects I've ever had (bar of course quantum physics) lined up, I can't afford to wave things off this time. 

And I STILL have no idea what I'm going to do once I get out of this...

Anyway, back to it. Don't know what it is, but it is apparently behind me, so I can go back to-- yeah that wasn't very funny. I'm reaching now XD

Off to work on RP stuff I guess! 

Maybe be updating this more in future ^.^

Well, of just about all the people I know who've done this test recently, I'm by a fair margin the most pure...

The placement of several of the things are amusing. =D

<lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">, I'd like to see your results. Mainly to check whether they have negative values possible.

I have taken care to remove the japanese music from the list, because there's only one person who reads my journal who would have a chance with that. A lot of the rest is pretty obscure too, though. 

The number in brackets before each is the number of songs I had to skip because they were japanese or had no lyrics at all :)

Oh, and if after listening to the song five times ~I~ had to look up the lyrics on google, I skipped that too XD Take THAT, Rhapsody. 

Sad thing is, I don't really know half of these songs myself. If nobody guesses correctly, I'm probably never going to be able to remember them.

"event","Well, I've just gotten back from another one of those DELIGHTFUL two-man graveyard shifts that I have, ooh, I don't know, EVERY WEEK. A lot of them are rather dealable these days because I'm working with probably the mightiest worker in the store, who does most of the work while I serve customers, but this one was a bit of a bugger.

For starters I'm on the back end of a rather unpleasant bug (the third in like five weeks - my immune system seems to have flown north for the winter) which means I probably shouldn't be working at all, but a) I wasn't feeling so bad b) I need the money and c) Let's face it, what are the chances of getting someone to cover a graveyard shift?

(Hint: The square root of -1 may be involved. Yes, that's right, the chance is so obscure it cannot be registered in natural numbers.)

However (There will be no more math for the rest of this entry, I promise, please don't flee) I'm quite glad I ended up going, for if nothing else the shift was... interesting. 

For starters, I have learnt that the good people at Cadbury-schweppes - AKA Pepsi - have started a new competition. Quite similar to one they had a while ago - Every label has a code with which you can send in (for a small fee) by SMS, and play a rock-paper-scissors game for great justice - or at least great booty.

Last time they had a prize EVERY HALF HOUR which meant that my natural inclination to be up at the wee hours of morn came in handy for those hard-to-reach half-hours. I actually managed to win myself $500 - which unfortunately then proceeded to vanish quite quickly as I was unable to work over the exam period but it's $500 I wouldn't have otherwise had! 

There was a choice between $500 in cash, two iPods (total value $600) and a phone (total value $650 or so). As I am quite content with my capable-of-sending-and-recieving-calls-and-SMS's $50 phone, not interested in the war that would quickly rise over the second iPod, and quite fond of cold hard cash, I chose the money.

THIS time, however, the choice is between $1000, a LAPTOP, and a PS3 AND PSP package. 

.......ARGH!

Not only that, but since the prizes have obviously increased in value, it's now every HOUR instead of half hour, making these prizes even harder to get. :) 

EVEN IF I WIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL CHOOSE!

A PS3 would be AWESOME, and the PSP is just an extra bounce into the bargain. However, knowing how infrequently I use my PS2 - despite the awesome selection of games I own and yet have not played - I'm not sure whether I'd get anything out of it.

The Laptop... I've yet to look into the exact specs but a working laptop for free is simply not something you turn down. Not amazingly useful in terms of entertainment but vastly useful for, y'know, everything else. I've never been fond of the things but portability is always a HUGE plus.

And, well, $1000 is $1000.

Well, I suppose step one is hoarding labels and codes =D I already have three! I'd love to say I'm not going to be reduced to scrounging through the bins at work for the things, but that's a very small hit to my dignity compared to any of the prizes. 



Other interesting factors at work today:

- I have seen the closest thing to essence of Bimbo I think I will ever see in real life. Makeup thick, bright blue clothes, bleached hair pulled up into very high ponytails which she was <i>twirling around her fingers.</i> I really didn't know this sort of thing happened in reality. She wasn't chewing gum, at least...

- I have also seen what must surely be the most ugly woman alive. 

Now let me get this straight - apart from her appearance there was nothing wrong with this lady that I could see. She was quite polite, quick with her money, no issue whatsoever, but dear god. Her face appeared to have been wax that had then MELTED onto her skull and dripped down. Her body not only sagged but OOZED, and her enormous cleavage was held in check by a pitiable, tiny lace affair which would surely have been far too low to be even vaguely respectable on anyone else. She seemed dressed to... impress - and her makeup was even worse.

Apparently having applied her makeup with a shotgun, it seemed to have melted in a completely DIFFERENT pattern to that of her face, creating strange shadows and nigh-on-non-euclidean designs. Some small jewellery graced her arms, I think, but I cannot remember it. Her fingernails - grown long and thick like flat-tipped claws - were painted in a brilliant turquoise that clashed with amazing precision with every other colour she wore. 

I know this sounds awful of me to say, but words cannot describe this. I like to think that my personal tastes are wide enough and my mind open enough to see good in most things, but this was far past subjective taste and well into objective fact. Lady, whoever you are, I wish you the best. 

- A large group of drunken teens happened past the store at approximately 2AM, along with a sudden run of cars. One of the cars' drivers, having been made to feel unduly threatened by the drunken teens around (and honestly I don't blame him) made a note to inform me that this ""was unacceptable"" and that we should have a bigger security detail on. He let me know in no uncertain terms that he would be speaking to KFC head office, and the local council, about having our licence to stay open to X in the morning revoked.

I think it was a true exercise in self-control to nod serenely and apologise, and not inform him of how DEVASTATED I would be if our store was to be FORBIDDEN from having a graveyard shift!

Not that there's any chance of that happening, unless this guy is connected beyond all reason. Best that could possibly happen is that we're forbidden to serve walk-throughs... although I really can't see that improving matters with the drunken louts, at least in the short-term...


Oh, and despite the fact that it was drizzling all night long, we had an amazing number of walkers AND bikers. 

Anyway, it's 5:16AM and I think the time for exceptionally coherent babbling has passed. To bed, to bed!"

"event","Okay. Procrastination has, over time and especially with the development of the internet, been developed into an art form. Procrastinating going to work, doing schoolwork, doing chores, doing tax forms, taking over the world...

Right now I seem to be procrastinating leaving the computer. There is absolutely no good reason for me to be doing this - hell, there's nothing LEFT for me to do here except walk out the door. I'm roleplaying tonight, and it's something I'm definately looking forward to, I just have yet to be bothered walking out the door.

Of course, the roleplaying tonight is actually not starting for some time so it's not exactly like I'm procrastinating that. I'm just sitting here.

....Well I suppose I DO have some homework I could be doing...


Anyway, this Livejournal post is primary devoted to whoever posted anonymously on my last LJ post on January 24th, with a beautiful statement of love and kindness. I really don't know why, but reading your heartwarming message made me want to bring this thing back to life for the first time in five months. I don't know who it is or what their reasoning is for their expressing their feelings, but it really helps me know that people care about what I do here. ^_^ 


Well, so far this year seems to be off to a good start which sorta wound down a little. I started out going to my lectures, having a good time, and then caught two seperate sicknesses on two weeks in a row, and missed a large slew of lectures because of it. 

Although we're technically still in the early weeks, I'm recognising the trouble signs already - the thought that I shouldn't bother going to the new lectures because I don't know what's happened in the old, and the thought that the early lectures aren't that important and don't require that much study. These two spark off a vicious cycle that I'm going to have to cut off soon (and am already working towards) - but for some reason despite this my free time seems to be less and less. I've discovered that running roleplays can be incredibly time-consuming now that I've got two pretty large ones going together. With roleplaying two nights a week and working three, this usually leaves one night for other commitments and one night to myself, and somehow they all seem to be eaten up. I think I need to really start on the timetabling business again.

I had a rather ambitious plan to start drawing a comic at one stage, but that's going to require a great deal of assault to get working, and I think I'll leave beginning that for the holidays. On top of that I need to find myself a new job - KFC is beginning to reach the point of truly ridiculous. Can anyone suggest a fun alternative? :)

<lj user=""thatgirlisfire""> is forbidden from responding to that question. Ever.

So yes, apart from some small time-management issues the world is going quite well. My finances steadily increase, I'm no longer doing physics, I like to THINK I'm losing weight, and things  with Sarah are awesome, even if the whole Tasman Sea thing can be a bit of a pain occasionally. Her parents are coming to Melbourne on work this week, but unfortunately she doesn't have the leave or finances to join them - something they justifiably tease her about no end. 

And that should be just about enough of me babbling about my life. Congratulations folks! You have been updated! It's only a bare-bones really, but hey, that's a quick summary. What, did you think I was going to give full details on my month-long trip to visit Sarah in New Zealand? Pish-posh. 

Take care, folks! I'll say I'll try to keep this better updated in future, but we all know that's going to be a lie. "

"event","Okay, there are many reasons in life not to start debates late at night, when both parties are ridiculously tired and pedantic by nature. This is a gem from a conversation between myself and my ex, <lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">, who share a rather abusive relationship that goes both ways and neither of us would have it any other way.

Despite my having put her livejournal link there, do not visit her journal. It is friends-only, and all you will do is be assaulted by Tarou.

Anyway, this is far from the first argument we've had, but it's the first time I've posted it on mine (as opposed to her posting on hers, which happens distressingly often) so yes XD

Background knowledge required: Recently it was discovered that I was roleplaying with my girlfriend on MSN as a pirate with some magical talent. Judge me as you will - as this clearly shows, somebody already has.

<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Now I am even <i>more</i> confused.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I'm afraid that's all the time we have for tonight
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: roflmao
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Seriously?
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Seriously.  lol   Either you lost me at some point or I lost you or you misread something because I am fucking gone here.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Okay. That second time you called me an idiot. That is a direct insult, and your reasoning behind it was irrational.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Not THAT.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: The bit BEFORE that.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Look, okay, here's where my confusion stems.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Your confusion protrusion.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Why the fuck would you consider me calling you a ""swashbuckling friend"" to NOT be insulting, knowing <i>very well</i> what I am referencing, and then yet find it offensive if I've made a joke about it moments before? What the hell difference does it make?>
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I never said it <i>wasn't</i> insulting. I said it was <i>indirectly</i> insulting - IE, it wasn't an insult in and of itself, but a reference to earlier insults.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: That wasn't a reference to earlier insults.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I was just insulting you.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: If I call you an idiot now and a moron in ten seconds, I'm not <i>referencing</i> the time before that I questioned your mental abilities, I'm just calling you a moron.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Okay, so how are you insulting me by calling me swashbuckling?
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Because you know very well what it's in reference to.  Not in reference to any earlier jokes, but to the fact that you ROLEPLAYED A MAGIC PIRATE FOR FUCK'S SAKE. It is IN AND OF ITSELF.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Yes, but calling someone 'swashbuckling' in and of itself is not an insult.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: It is when you're you.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Stop typing.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Right now.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Okay, a) fuck you.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Not kidding.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I'm saying it is when it's you because you have a history that it's in refernce to. If I said it to my sister, sure, wouldn't be insulting. If someone said it to me, sure, wouldn't be insulting.  If someone called me a ""genitally-challenged friend"" then to ME it would be an insult, to my sister it would not, are you getting where I'm going here.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: It is something RELEVENT TO YOU. It is not a previous joke that has caused 
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Whoops.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: It is not a previous joke that has caused anything here.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Yes. And thus, as it is an insult relevant to a <i>history</i>, it is not an insult in and of itself, thus it is indirect. I referenced the earlier jokes, referring to the fact that you had previously made one hell of a mockery out of me over this fact, and without that prior knowledge it probably wouldn't make sense.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: AH.  And now we see the problem.  You don't know the meaning of indirect.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Or I don't.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: The previous jokes are ANOTHER reference which can be cut out of the system if necessary.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: One of us has faulty wiring. lol
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: One of us is a programmer.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Well the other refernce was what was getting me.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: The fact that it's linked in with history, yes, I agree. It was bringing up the previous jokes that was shitting me because it made no sense.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: OKay look, listen, I'm going to give the example from a moment ago.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I said that if I was making fun of you with pirate stuff, and your father had been a pirate and died at sea so I was hitting a nerve, I was indirectly upsetting you.  You said that would be direct.  There's where you're wrong.  Although the fact that I was making fun of you was straight forward, you were only upset (theoretically) about your father -- something I DIDN'T KNOW OF, something I was UNWARE I WAS DOING but was doing nonetheless.  I was hurting you indirectly, by throwing something out there, having it bounce off different pieces of information, then end up hurting you after all but for reasons I didn't intend.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: <i>Indirect</i>, Damo. It's not direct.  It has detours.  lol
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: It's like my mother in a car, with insults.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Ahhh, yes, if it was unintentional that'd probably be indirect but in a different way
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I didn't consider that.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I was more thinking about it like this:
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: ""Swashbuckling"", in and of itself, is not insulting. (barring cases of random piratical parenthood.)
As a reference to the roleplay, it is relevant and referential but not necessarily insulting.
As a reference to the roleplay AND the vast quantity of insult you have heaped upon me, it reminds and brings that insult back to the foreground, reinforcing it and thus giving it more power, most definately being insulting.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: <b><font color=""#ff0000""><i>Damos Taranth</font></b> is typing, has entered text, is typing, has entered text, is typing...</i>

MAKE UP YOUR MIND, MAN.
...Oh look, you did.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I'll enter your text typing.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Yes see, this is what I meant about you being an idiot.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: ""As a reference to the roleplay, it is relevant and referential but not necessarily insulting.""

Not necessarily insulting? <i>Not necessarily insulting?</i>  I am referencing.. in ANY way, the fact that you RP'ed as a God damn Harry Potters of the Carribean crossover to get your girlfriend off, the only person who would NOT link someone like me referencing that in any sense with shame and the general idea that I'm insulting you is one sandwich short of a picnic.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Why the hell did <i>this</i> of all things turn into a debate.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Yes. But in the case of it being NOT you who said it, if someone else who knew about the roleplay came up and said it to me, then that would not necessarily be insulting. The fact that I know you and we have gone through such things several times before would show that even if you HADN'T laden me with insults before, the reference would show that I very shortly would be (and indeed I believe that's exactly what happened) but it works far better as a continual reference than in and of itself. 
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: And <i>I know.</i>
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: We're not even debating the original topic anymore.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Works far better as a continual reference as may be, but the fact remains that believe it or not, <i>I am me.</i> You can't go around deciding that everything that's said that has ANY sort of inflection from who its coming from is jaded and null because it's not a general statement anyone could have said.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Okay.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Let me put this another way for you.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: We broke down the arguement and the last you had was ""Well..  WHAT IF IT WASN'T YOU?!?! HUH?!??!""
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: <i>Weak</i> at best.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Let's say a third person was listening to the argument. If they knew nothing of the backstory, they would think it random.

If they knew that I roleplayed a pirate <i>and</i> what you thought of it, then they would probably yes know it was insulting because they know you.

If they knew how you'd gone off at me earlier, they would have found it far MORE insulting because they knew the backstory, would've been reminded of it, and - well, let's face it, probably would've broken out laughing uncontrollably BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: STOP
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: STOP YOURSELF RIGHT THERE
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Stop. Stop typing.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Good boy.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: HEY.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: STOP IT.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I MEAN IT, MISTER.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Thankyou.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Don't do this just to shit me.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I will kill you.,
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: If I see you typing again, I'm telling her you fingered me while you were over here on your birthday.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Are we clear?
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: ...........Good.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Now.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: First I need to laugh at that.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Haaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahaha.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: And now back to the point.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Now look at what you just wrote. You said, in short;

You understand the joke and know it was insulting from the very beginning.
I understand the joke and know it was insulting from the very beginning.
If someone else was there, they might not have.

And now I ask you. <i>Who</i> was in the conversation.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: You may type now.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: With the additional reference to previous insult, the indirect insult is reinforced. I'm talking from an objective view, not a subjective view.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: BUT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE VIEW!  IT WAS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, CLOSED OFF FROM ALL OUTSIDE OBSERVATION!
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: HUMAN BEINGS UNDERSTAND THE ADAPTION TO SPEECH IN THIS SITUATION!  <i>MONKEYS</i> UNDERSTAND IT! ...Or would, if.. they could talk.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: There's always an objective view. 

Look. Simple maths. If you had called me 'swashbuckling', without actually telling me anything more than you knew about the roleplay, you honestly believe that it would have the same impact as it did after you went on and on about it?
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Well that's going into degree and strength of the insult now, not just whether the insult would have occured at all, which is what we were discussing.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Actually I ceded that point about half an argument ago.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: And frankly, yes.  The first time I insulted you about it, it bore just as much as it does now.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: ROFLMAO WE'VE BEEN ARGUING DIFFERENT TOPICS
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Because you know the kind of person I am. And if you start going into ""BUT WHAT IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE""isms, <i>I will gut you.</i>
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: No, the first time you insulted me about it, it bore <i>because I knew that the extensive mockery was coming.</i>
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: God, I don't even know what I'm arguing anymore. I think I already won.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: No, we started arguing different sides of different arguments
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Because I'd won.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: And yet you kept going
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Okay look, what were you arguing.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Well I thought you had more! but you didn't!
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: I am arguing that the additional reference to previous extensive mockery strengthens the mockery of an indirect insult.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Also, I argue that we are both very tired and should go to bed.
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: Let me put up a <i>little maths for you here</i>
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: BIG WORDS
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: +
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: 12:16
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: =
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: <b><i><u><font size=7>WHAT.</b></u></i></font>
<b><font color=""#0000ff"">thatgirlisfire</font></b>: I argue that YOU'RE very tired and I should go to bed.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Damos Taranth</font></b>: Yeah. Bed for all involved.

So. I go out on halloween, dressed as the most terrifying creature I can imagine, so loathesome that merely appearing in his guise is painful.

What do I find?

- <lj user=""darkjediprinces"">, while handing out the correct item, is stingy.
- <lj user=""kirby1024""> is cruel. I mean seriously. A rock? Someone could hurt themselves!
- <lj user=""martyfan""> is generous and pleasant. Although why her watermelon-flavoured candies are <i>tan</i> I don't quite understand.
- <lj user=""mauvedragon""> is handing out radioactive candy?
- <lj user=""raimei""> has colour and flavour matching, and thus I come to the conclusion that either his randomness has come full cicle back to predictability, or somebody is very poorly impersonating him.
- <lj user=""silverflame146"">, same as DJP above!
- <lj user=""thelusankya"">'s presents for some reason make me very suspiscious. But that could be natural paranoia combined with a healthy fear of her.
- <lj user=""webseer"">, how could you? ;_;
- <lj user=""zae""> is handing out clothespins. For some reason, this terrifies me.

And, of course, it seems that almost ALL the candy I collected has found its way into <lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">'s hands. Oh, shock and horror and wonderment. 

Apologies to <lj user=""fireflyfairy"">, the only KNOWN friend on my list who didn't make it into this quiz, mostly because I haven't seen her in ages and there was a maximum of ten people. <lj user=""caerell""> didn't make it either, but that's because I have no idea who that is. ^_^"

Mmm... when I started writing this, I had it in my head to fully describe procrastinatory land. But I think the land itself is procrastinating over being defined. So I think that'll have to wait.

ANYWAY! Yes. I have homework to do. I do NOT have much in the way of RPOL to do, which is admittedly a state I've not experienced for some time. I am tired and I have a physics prac in an hour, which will serve to put me to sleep completely...

Yes, weep, computer, for you shall never again feel the tende- oh, wait, don't cry. No, please, I didn't mea- oh god, what am I doin--

Okay, welcome to W-CL19-G10-23. 

She's my new computer. The last one was a little unstable when I told her I was leaving and not coming back, and did some strange things but it's alright. She's been taken away. We don't have to worry about her anymore.

So! Anyway. Apart from my computer issues, we seem to be doing pretty well here. Busy! Very busy. Thankfully tomorrow I get to be completely non-uni-ish but I think I'm gonna have to come in anyway to get stuff done...

Two projects due in by the end of the week, but they're not that tough :D Just have to remember to start them now. NOW. >.<

In the meantime, there's a funky chicken that needs dancing. 

Please, for the love of god, do not question this. 

Right, it seems my brain has run out of both random and funny, and seems to have established its higher functions working on world domination. I think it's the flower. The flower growing out of my head. It feeds on my ego and lives in the tophat I have yet to buy.

...No, the insane one was the computer, not me. I'm perfectly fine. 

...Okay, run out of funny, but not random. :)

Still planning to get that roleplay board up sooner or later. Just need the requisite time and effort. It is not forgotten.

Anyway, I should be off. Take care.

"event","Alright, I think I'm going to have to start up a pattern here. Not writing any two journal entries from the same computer room.

Of course, this is a tad difficult, since I've already used up the two easiest-to-access ones and am, as I speak, wiping out the third. Of course, if I had a laptop this would be much easier considering that a laptop allows me to work from ANY given room... but technically that would be cheating because it's the same -computer-.

Maybe I should just make it that I never send from the same computer twice, though I guess that's difficult because I've already forgotten which computers i was on the first time. 

Well, THIS computer is w-cl19-g11-25, and never again shall I post on livejournal from this machine!


Anyway, what I'm ACTUALLY doing here is procrastinating on my computer science work. A programming project. I mean sure, I have another 8 days to get it in... but that's REALLY not the sort of thinking you want to use for compsci. 

So, what now, what now. I think I'm going to set up a seperate livejournal simply to keep track of a few RPs I'm in.. or maybe one that can be used by many people. For those people who frequent Korner, read this journal, and RP fairly regularly - I believe there's two of you - would you be at all interested in a random tell-us-about-your-RPs style community journal doovy? 

I think I'll set it up anyway and work out the kinks from there. Of course, non-Korner people are also equally welcome to note the contents of their RPs. <lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">, however, may not approach the community with a 60-foot pole. (Or without one either, but specifically not with one. There are some people who you just don't trust lugging around long, thin, rigid objects)

Muahaha.


Well, the off-hand comment at the end of my last entry, as expected, caused as much comment as the rest put together. Reactions ranged from very bad to very annoying. The latter primarily being my father, who upon finding out that said young lady lives in New Zealand, proceeded to run through his ENTIRE collection of kiwi jokes.

It was a long, embarrassing, if perhaps somewhat amusing night. Thankfully she has a sense of humour, judging by the fact that SHE told me a few that even my father missed. XD

Oh, and also high on the annoying scale was a certain someone attempting to infect her with Tarou. That's just low. 


Anyway, it's time to get on with my work. Have fun, strange people. I return to my natural state of staring at the monitor and trying to figure out how to procrastinate next.."

So! Livejournal once again. What should I place within my livejournal? There's really nothing happening that truly deserves placing within this text-based reflection of my life. I could relay my roleplaying experiences but that would be incredibly boring for many, although it would be worth transcribing at some stage or another...

Maybe I'll do that and hide it under cute little LJ cut doovies.

Later.

(Note to self, must remember how to LJcut)

Apart from that, there's KFC, who caused me all sorts of grief on Saturday, which was SO beautifully washed away by sleep that I woke up feeling better than I have in ages on Sunday (and indeed, since then I've actually been surprisingly awake on less sleep than usual) and uni, which is uni and unchanging. The political activists are handing out pamphlets as usual. I'll just sit here in my little underground bunker computer room.

I wonder if Terrorists would attack the Menzies building? Nah, they'd probably consider its destruction an improvement to Melbourne as a whole. Sooo ugly. (For non-Monash people, the Menzies building is an architectural nightmare, too tall, too thin, and FAR too ugly.)

(Besides... it's technically for the arts & humanities students anyway. ^^;)

And of course there's the new young lady in my life, but I'm sure nobody wants to hear about that...

*squee*.

*cough* ANYWAY. XD This has been another fairly contentless ramble for my livejournal, and I hope you all enjoyed it thoroughly. Now, to potentially productive things! *points* AWAYY~! *runs in that direction*"

I pose for great justice!

I pose so YOU don't have to!

...actually I couldn't be bothered posing right now. Tired.


Yo! I have a livejournal, and it's gathering dust. *poke poke it and sneeze* It's useful occasionally to see what my friends are up to but I never seem to post in it myself, which sucks. 

Considering that I am currently both bordering on internetlessness AND excessively bored at uni I elect to apply a post over that dust. Technically I should probably wipe said dust OFF first but no, that would be far too intelligent. So we just hope that this post doesn't slip on the dust, or absorb it and become some sort of hybrid dust-post which will eventually consume my livejournal, and then starve to death on lack of content.

Or, y'know, get dusty.

So yes. To those people who currently are wondering why I'm not online anymore, the answer is I'm not online anymore. Over the past two semesters I have failed seven out of eight subjects, effectively wasting a year of my life. This obviously shows that I really need a rework of my life, and thus - at least for the beginning of semester, until I can get a proper schedule going - I'm not going to be using any chat programs or the like. 

At present I'm restricting my online activities to email, livejournal, and - unfortunately - rpol.net. Ahh, rpol.net, consumer of so very many hours. What would we do without you. However, I do plan to get back in contact with most people, so those of you who don't have me LJ'd will probably be recieving emails or the like sooner or later. 

By the way, new icon AND journal layout both courtesy of <lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">, whose journal you probably can't read because it's friends only and you're not her friends. But we thank her nonetheless. I advise everyone NOT to check her journal, because it is currently infected by some form of Plastic Tree virus and anyone visiting it will be exposed to horrible, scarring quantities of Tarou. 

Who is Tarou, you ask? Why, Tarou is some form of humanoid being who CLAIMS to be human, but you can see in those dead, lifeless eyes that it's actually some form of horrible doppelganger out to... well, we don't know what it's out to do, but it's painful to gaze upon. It also 'sings' in a band called Plastic Tree, although it's more of a droning nothingness which effectively overwhelms and cancels out whatever actual melody the instruments might provide. It's really quite amazing to listen to, if you don't value your SAN score.

Yes... he's like a very, very boring elder god... a subtle one, which deals only 1d2 SAN, chipping away gently at your mind so subtly that you don't even realise you've become a gibbering horror. I think I'm going to have to use that if I ever run Call of C'thulhu.

Anyway, a mighty heyo and all to everyone out there. With any luck I'll be updating this more often, but in all serious realism I'll be updating this more often for all of a week before I lose interest again. BUT WHAT A WEEK IT SHALL BE! O_O

Ciao. *POSE*

"event","Well, when two lovely if rarely-seen young women tag me for a thingimajiggit, I suppose I'm going to have to do it myself.

Tagged by <lj user=""martyfan""> and <lj user=""darkjediprinces"">: <i>Once you are tagged you MUST write a blog entry about your 6 weird habits/things as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose the next six people to be tagged and list their names.</i>

1) Hands must ALWAYS be doing something, often eyes, too. This tends to often put people off in conversations, as I'm constantly fiddling with something (usually something that makes an annoying noise) and also have a tendency to basically look at anything and everything except them, especially that screensaver with the polygons that change colours and trail like 6 more in their wake as they go around the screen and every corner moves seperately and changes direction every time it hits a wall and wipes out the contents of the screen as it goes.

I believe the screensaver is called ""Hypnosis"". If so, they have named it most aptly.

2) I gave up my title as a computer gamer years ago, but I still buy games. Constantly. Rarely new ones - I go for the second-hand or on-sale ones... but I have about 30 PS2 games (about 25 of which are RPGS) of which I have played hardly any. My computer game collection is nearly into its second folder of 72 CDs, yet most of them have never even been installed. WHY? I don't know ;_;

3) I have weird money habits. Anything more than $20, hell, anything more than $10, I'll be hesitant to buy, even if it's something that'll be useful to me for many many days to come. But I'll quite happily (well, not happily, but readily) spend $50-100 a week on food and the like at uni that I really don't need, because it's bought in $5-8 chunks. This is really a habit I need to break. The computer games mentioned in #2 don't seem to fit into this, either, unfortunately.

4) I have a definate tendency to mimic speech patterns and similar unconsciously. Within seconds of talking to somebody at work, I'll usually have a reasonable imitation of their accent down if I'm not thinking about it. Friends who have particularly unique methods of speaking, I tend to mimic more extensively, especially when talking to them. It's rather annoying at times, because I have a lot of trouble holding it in check, and I think it's beginning to annoy a couple of my friends.

5) I have a recent obsession with dancing, almost certainly sparked off by World of Warcraft's /dance command. Whenever I find myself not doing anything important at work or uni, and find someone randomly staring at me, I break into a little dance to whatever's on the radio at the time. This is indeed unfortunate, as I am not particularly capable of dancing.

Also, my reaction to just about any sort of depressing problems people are having, or the question ""So, what do we do now?"", is nearly invariably ""Dance.""

6) I have a strange habit with things I feel I 'have to do'. This includes visiting friends and work, although not homework. I will struggle against all odds and such to do them, even if I had other plans, which tends to stress me out a bit sometimes but eh. Usually if somebody's relying on me to do something, or I even get the vaguest impression they are, I'll do it - for instance, I hate missing a work shift for anything short of bleeding to death, and hate turning down someone who asks me to do their shift almost as much. I used to have an agreement with myself that I'd take any invitation to go out that was offered, since I would never actually initiate any going out myself, but my schedule these days is hectic enough that that's no longer an option.

Still, the work thing was fun, especially when I was doing five shifts a week PLUS accepting any offers people throw at me. There is almost nothing more satisfying than hearing your parents telling you that you should work LESS.

"event","Hey, why not? Got nothing better to do. Bored and avoiding talking to people, so we talk to people using the wonderful MEDIUM O' LIVEJOURNAL MUAHAHAHAA *thundercrash* etc.

It is the day before father's day, and I have been shopping. I have purchased an ENTIRELY selfless - read that, I have no self-interest in obtaining this gift at all - present for my father consisting of the next two seasons of SG-1. I have no idea why you might think that I might have my own interests in mind while doing this.

I really need to change the layout of this place. While it does look immensely spiffy (thank you as always <lj user=""thatgirlisfire"">) I really should make something of my own to put in there. But what, is the question. What. Hmm. *thinkthink*

And now, I suppose I will wander off with intent of either doing homework or Arena-related stuff. 

By process of behavioural pattern recognition, Arena-related stuff here we come! :D"

"event","Physics exam in two hours. Quantum physics. Eigenvalues. Schrodinger. Particle in an infinite one-dimensional well. Hermetian operators.

*melts and dies* I UNDERSTAND NONE OF THIS CRAP!

I am going to literally walk into an exam where I understand not a single question. Exams are supposed to be my specialty! These are where I make up marks that I lost from not doing homework! 

I HATE QUANTUM PHYSICS!

Ahh... looks like I'm doing this subject again next year.

I'm procrastinating looking at the notes so badly I'm actually UPDATING MY LJ. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW INCREDIBLY PROCRASTINATORY THIS IS? You probably do, if you've even glanced at the dates.

Must... get back to work. 

How is it that one's brain can be far too awake to sleep (Oh yeah, haven't slept all night.) but take one look at a sheet of formulas and instantly blank out? Gyah. 

Can't wait for this to be over and done with. Good thing I'll be walking out of the exam straight after the reading time is over!"

"event","Well, I guess at random insistance that I should really try updating this thing. Huzzah.

This is my second time at trying to work a livejournal. All that remains of the first is the background and the usericons, which, while magnificent, shall probably be changed when I can be bothered. 

Well, it's been a fun couple of days. Car got stolen last night. Woo. Sucks to be me. Got found several suburbs away with windows smashed in and the front totaled, completely undrivable and apparently somewhat uninsured, since hey, you're covered for theft, and you got your car back, didn't you? :D 

It'll cost more to fix than it will to buy a new one. So it's not a whole lot of use one way or another.

In other news, KFC has latched onto my soul with intention to drink me dry and fill the remains with chicken-salt. That's what it does. In truth, nothing new there.

Sims 2 is a lot more fun when you stick with it long enough to actually get a family WORKING, and get enough money to buy the stuff you need to survive. It's hard at first, but you get there. Eventually.

Anyway, that's my LJ intro for the day. I'm tired, it's 3:30AM, and I have sleep to... sleep. Woo. 

Oh lookie, SIMs-thingy! :D

Look at me. Give me attention. Let me pretend for one fleeting moment that I am far more important than you will ever be. Please. People haven't been doing that lately, for some reason. 

Aren't I pathetic? This isn't even funny. It's not even pitiable, it's downright sad. Don't expect the diary to be any better, I've looked around these things, and I can't see why any of you would want to read this. You're looking for something angst-ridden, something depressive, I can see it in your eyes. And I don't deal in that sorta stuff. Nope, I have a happy, stable family; I have no depressive problems; I can handle everything that's going on at school. I'm not one for writing dark poetry or copying out slews of depressive lyrics.

My life is really, really boring. :P You don't want to hear about it.

So instead, I'm just going to muse. And write what I think. And you, my friends are going to give me your opinion. 

So do it! Tell me how horrifically boring I am and how you'll never look at my diary again! This is MEANT to scare you away. Nobody should be reading this. It's for the good of the public. Really. It is."

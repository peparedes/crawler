OMFG too funny it was loud and squishy and mega gross but i couldn't help laugh anyways. I got my first assist in hockey!! I was playing offense with dennis and darryl and the ball was headed my way, so i passed to dennis and he shot it in. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. Watch out NHL here i come. Well, only for you to laugh at me. Oh Well. I still gotta find a way to get in touch with the maple leafs or tie domi, see if they want to come down and play hockey wif us...."

"event","I'm so proud of AJ. Even though he had his anxiety attack today, and was really upset because he didn't even finish the application for DM telemarketing, he finally got a letter in the mail about the police force! He's so happy, he has an interview out in LeRoy.
It makes me wonder how long it's gonna be before I can get a decent job... Not that I'm complaining. I get paid to play video games 20 hours a week and I love that!
But it would be nice to be able to afford a new car, or to move out of my dad's house. But, i guess, everything takes time.

I so wanna be a radio dj again after starting Holy Puck Radio with Jess. That station; the site, my show, have all consumed me. Maybe I could send a sample to a broadcasting company and see what they think... not that they'd let my play my music on the air or anything. Meh.
 But yeah, I'm seriously going to bed. Night to all of ya.

"event","So tonight I went out to AJ's , since he got out of work early. I'd been worried about him all day because he had an anxiety attack when we went up to DialAmerica (he was applying for a job there.) Not to change the subject, but that job is the devil. Only satan spawn can't work there. This is example #3. 
Anyways, we were gonna go to a party that AJ got invited to, but cover was ridiculously expensive (10 bucks for guys, 7 bucks for gals.) 

Im relieved we didn't go, because there was rumor of a wet t-shirt contest. Don't get me wrong, there is no way I would enter, but honestly seeing my AJ staring at some other chicks' tits would definately piss me off. Because chances are they'd be bigger than mine, and we all know about my self-esteem issues with my rack.

But anyways, we went to the coffeeshop in Batavia, Main Street Coffee. I absolutely love that place... it was basically a bunch of skate/punk/hardcore kids running it, chilling there, and it wasn't real packed or uncomfortably ""trendy"". I have a feeling we'll be spending more time there in the summer:)

Have you watched the Graham Norton effect yet?? I was real skeptical but I saw this week's episode, has the scottish guy who played a hobbit in LOTR as a guest... he was talking about cock rings, they were playing pranks on people in a public restroom... really good stuff. I got some good laughs out of it tonight.

BUT, I am going to bed. I'll catch up with y'all later.
tune into www.holypuckradio.com
okay, I'm done whoring my website and radio station. That are freaking amazing. Okay I'll stop for real this time. Night everyone:)"

"event","So, I'm DJing my radio station, as I do almost everyday, hoping someone will tune in. I got nothing. Why, might you ask? Because the world is too big for my futile attempts. For example, how many people are reading this jopurnal? If anyone does stumble upon this, at least leave a comment and say hi. Cause, you know, that would be uber cool. And, if you didn't want me to call you a same-sex kissing emo kid, you would tune in to my station, too. You can get there by clicking on the link at www.holypuckradio.i8.com  . And then, while you were listening, you could send me an IM, on yahoo as holy_puck_radio . And I'm really pissed off about AIM, I wanted the name Penny Axewound and someone already has it. What the fuck. I mean, honestly, who else goes by the alias of Penny Axewound?! I'm such a paranoid delusional that I'm theorizing that they know me, and thought the name was cool so they snagged. WHO EVER YOU ARE, MISS AXEWOUND, YOU ARE ONLY AN IMPOSTOR!!! THE REAL PENNY AXEWOUND IS WAITING FOR REVENGE, RIGHT HERE. Unless you want to be nice and give me your AIM name. Then please email me at trupwpunkchick@yahoo.com . Thank you:)"

Annd I was kinda dpressed cuz I couldnt find pennywise ringtones for it since it isnt through a big carrier, but I found better ones; Zepplin's ""stairway to heaven"", Marley's ""no woman no cry"", and Less Than Jake's ""automatic"". Sweet. If do find pennywise though let me tell you i will cry tears of joy.

My tires are no longer unfit to drive, so I am going out for awhile. I was sposed to go to the driving range with my dad, but he's not home yet, so I'll prolly just go to the beach, or out to Best Buy to replace a CD. Maybe chill with some friends while i'm out there. Dunno yet.

"event","So last night, I was trying to shop for a good prepaid cell phone plan (which btw I thought existed, AT&T is close but even then they still suck balls). So Im on verizon's website, and i choose a link to pay as you go. okay. redirects me to an entirely different page, so I browse around, find a plan that seems to good to be prepaid. So im like holy shit dude, verizon kicks ass. 
mmmmmmhmmmmmm.
 so this morning I go back, and i wake up out of my euphoric state to notice that it is a normal plan. Which is lame. Why did they have to redirect me to a different page even titled ""freeup"", like their prepay plan, to just jerk me around a little on that website and con me into a plan. Because, you see, that IS a con.
So you know what? I went on ahead and filled out everything, because it let me confirm and ccept my order. THEN i get the email. They still have to do a final credit check. I mean, wtf? I thought they did that when it took 5 mins. to process all my information. FREAKING GAY! 
I paid my debts this morning however, so maybe by the time it processes I will get accepted. If I get half-accepted, meaning I have to put down a deposit, provided it's not much, I might do that.

Although I sincerely doubt getting accepted at all. I dont have a snowball's chance in hell. And on top of that I have to wait. i hate waiting. I shouldve just gone to the store and done it, and waited 5 seconds for them to give me a snooty look and say it can't be processed.
Fuck I hate cell phone companies."

"event","<P>So today was the first really good day I had in a long time. First, this afternoon, I recieved my check from MCC. I was supposed to get 1,350, but... dudes I got 2,200 bucks. Freakin' rockin'. Now I am not gonna go crazy spending it, I need to get out of debt and fix my car . After that, I think the only thing I'm determined to get is a cell phone. I want to talk to my dad about a few options that I've been running over too. Then Joe IMs me and we decide to go to Eastview mall. So awesome, cuz I was getting tired of sitting at home all the time. So we go, and I did very good for the first half of the trip, didnt buy anything but a godiva chocolate (yummy) and a smoothie. Buuutt I did wind up buying a Volcom hat (cuz I have wanted a hat for a few weeks now,and this one was kickin'.... ok and I'll admit i'm a Volcom Whore.) </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we decide to leave the mall, and on our way out I started buggin' cuz I couldn't figure out where my smoothie went. I even accused Joe of hiding it on me, which is ridiculous because unless he's some type of ninja he couldn't have ripped it from my hand. So Joe informs me that on our way exiting the mall via Penny's i threw it out. I didnt even believe him. God, I'm stupid. This is why pot is bad. Because even after you dtich the habit of smoking almost every day you forget stuff like that. Make me your poster child.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I bought a $10 shirt at Old Navy to compensate for the 25 i spent on a hat and the 1.62 i spent on one freakin truffle. It's cute, and it matches my V-whore hat. In fact I will post a pic later when i reinstall my webcam:) Of the hat. not the truffle. you stupid idiot.</P>"

I hafta work today. I'm too tired to work. And Im hungry, but that can be solved pretty easily.
I hate my car, because other than work I am stranded at my house until I get new front tires, the ones I have on it now have some of the metal threads sticking out. By next tues, I hope, anyways.
On one side, (at least I hope ) AJ and I are hopefully having less problems, we talked for close to an hour last night, i feel a little bit better. SO at least there's one less thing to worry about.
Someone needs to call me at work around 7 -7:30 and tell me the score on the stanley cup game tonight. I will be pissy if Calgary loses again. VERY pissy.
But Yeah, if you are reading this:
1. Find me a clean music downloading program
2. Bring me some cookies to work (preferably chocolate chip)
3. Call me by 7:30 with the game score (prolly still be in 2nd period.)

Thank god I have to work today, because at least there the only contact I have is with acqauintances, my boss, and customers. 
I think I've decided I don't like having people close to me, because I feel like a.) they use me to get what they want (my mother, the propaganda slathering whore) or b.) I can't make them happy, even when I try my hardest.
I mean, why bother? I can't do anything right for the people I'm closest to, so I might as well hold everyone off at bay so they won't be dissapointed in me. 

You know what's sad? I have been waiting almost a week for my Tie Domi action figure to get here, and I am in such a terrible mood that the box is still unopened on my living room floor. I even hoped he would be here when I woke up, to cheer me up, but it didn't work.

     Also calling my house will be a futile event for a day or two... i think the outside line is fucked beyond all repair, so when u call it will only ring once and go silent on your end. If you stay on the line, though, it'll half-ring at my house, so wait a minute or two before hanging up and if i'm home I'll answer... otherwise the only way to get ahold of me is by IM, which is usually the most efficient way regardless.

I run down the stairs and look out the front window, trying to peer on the porch step. No sign of anything. Sighing, I get dressed and put on shoes to get the mail. As I reach for the front door, I stop dead in my tracks. A brown package, addressed to myself, sitting on the step. I shriek with joy, and fling open the front door only long enough to grab the parcel. My cat watches my commotion with her usual curiousity as I plop down on the couch with a knife to open the box. My hands are shaking, heart beating fast, I rip through the tape into a world of newspaper and stryofoam. Runt moves to sit on my lap, knowing she'll have full priviledges over the empty box. Ripping through the paper I see a hint of orange-yellow through a thick layer of bubble wrap. I can't see anything but the bubble wrap I'm tearing through and the yellow plastic underneath.

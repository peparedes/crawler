"event","I'm missing you so much, I'll see you die tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know the signs are on and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to

You had me at hello.

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I feel more with everyday that goes by
I watch the clock so I can make my timing just right

Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you.

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

You gave me butterflies at the mailbox (you had me at hello)
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox (you had me at hello)

"event","<p>so lets see on 4/20 I walked up the mountain in town in the middle of the night with a bunch of people I normally don't hangout with. To say the least it was amazing. I needed something like that. Other than that I haven't really done anything fun...maybe on Saturday though Ill go to six flags. In the past few days Ive done a lot of thinking, talked to people I haven't talked to in a while and got the closure Ive needed. As part of that closure Ive finally decided where Im going to college. Imagine that. The one person I know who doesn't care where I go had a part in me deciding that. Im going down to Virginia. I need to get away from Brattleboro and memories that keep surfacing. I need to spend time with my dad. Yeah Ill miss my friends and Sammy &lt;3 but thats what vacations are for. Well. We'll see how it goes. </p>"

"event","Im done trying. I don't have the time, patience, or room in my life for this.&nbsp;
I tried.&nbsp;
Im tired.
Thats all there is to it.&nbsp;
I have so much crap going on that I've become broken.&nbsp;
I want to break up with my boyfriend.&nbsp;
Not because Im not happy with him&nbsp;but Im not happy with myself and that just seems to radiate off of me.&nbsp;
I can't go a day with out&nbsp;biting someones head off.&nbsp;
Its not that I&nbsp;want to, because I don't mean to it just&nbsp;happens.&nbsp;
I work way too much yet thats not enough.
I need money.&nbsp;
Im sorry Im younger than you and a supervisor.&nbsp;
Get over it.&nbsp;
Don't act childish.&nbsp;
Don't tell me you don't have to listen to me.&nbsp;
Last time I checked, I ask nicely and when people say no I tell them to do it.&nbsp;
And thats rare.&nbsp;
Hours being cut back due to sports.

Tracks starting thats gonna interfere but its my last year and even though i suck at it,&nbsp;it makes me happy.&nbsp;
College is coming up really fast.&nbsp;
Have about a month and a half to decide where I want to go.&nbsp;
Do I want to stay close to home or move in with my dad over the summer and go to a&nbsp;Virginia school.&nbsp;
Do&nbsp;I want to attempt to stay with Sam even if we go far apart.&nbsp;


WHAT THE FUCK DO I WANT!!!!

Can someone please just tell me.&nbsp;
I have noone to talk to.&nbsp;
And it feels shitty.&nbsp;
I have no friends to go to.&nbsp;
I've lost touch.&nbsp;
And you know what.&nbsp;
Thats the shittiest part.&nbsp;

Its shitty that I get to the&nbsp;point where I just get to the point that I break down and cry at work because a mistake was made.&nbsp;
That was all that it took to push me over the edge.&nbsp;
Its shitty that I was so close to breaking up with sam and told him.&nbsp;
I saw the hurt in his eyes and I can't explain&nbsp;enough that its not him.&nbsp;
Its me.&nbsp;
Its me and I can't stop these feelings.&nbsp;

I want to reconnect with my friends.&nbsp;
I do.&nbsp;
I guess I dont deserve that though.

I want to be the person I use to be.&nbsp;
I want to hang out with my friends.&nbsp;
I've pretty much forgotten what thats like.&nbsp;
The only one I ever see is Ashley and thats so rare.&nbsp;

Im always working or with Sam.&nbsp;
I want to break away from that.&nbsp;
The other day I needed someone to call and talk to and I realized who the hell was I going to call??
Schools more than half way over and I just want to be happy.
Happy is something Im not right now.&nbsp;

Ive gotten the worse report card of my life and it blows.&nbsp;

I need some fun and I have a lot of stuff to make up to people.&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;Please Please Please let things work out.&nbsp;

The last two weeks have just been shitty.&nbsp;
Sam broke up with me yesterday.&nbsp;
I think.&nbsp;
I mean he did but we are still in a relationship.&nbsp;
NO anything with other people.&nbsp;
And we can still hangout we just aren't boyfriend and girlfriend right now??
Im not really sure myself.&nbsp;
All I know is I don't like how things are.&nbsp;
It hurts A LOT!
Last night I kept having these messed up dreams and I couldn't sleep which made me hurt and miss him more.&nbsp;
I tried calling this morning.&nbsp;
Probably shouldn't have.&nbsp;
We are working on space.
I want to say a lot of things to him but I dont have the guts.&nbsp;
All I can think of is how much I miss him.&nbsp;
Every stupid song I listen to reminds me of him.&nbsp;
Im glad my iPod broke because then I don't have to listen to the Beatles.&nbsp;
I want things better.&nbsp;
I want them back to normal.&nbsp;
I knew we shouldn't have hung out every single day, Dan warned me.&nbsp;
I guess all I can do is wait for a phone call.&nbsp;
I love him. I really do.&nbsp;



Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy.
There's nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be in time
It's easy.
All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love, love is all you need.
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love, love is all you need.
There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.
It's easy.
All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love, love is all you need.
All you need is love (all together now)
All you need is love (everybody)
All you need is love, love, love is all you need."

I got to spend Wednesday and Thursday with Sam's family and just the fact that I was invited made me feel really good, made me feel like someone whose boyfriend loves to show off. I haven't felt that way in a long time and it was great. His family was extremly nice and crazy. But I <font color=""#ff0000""><em>LOVE</em></font> crazy people. I got to hangout with his awesome cousins as well: Harry 16, Jamie 17, Lou 12 and of course his brother Luc. We all chilled and played bball, ping pong, football, and watched tv, and a lot of other things. Hanging with his family was great but hanging out with just him this weekend was Ammmazzzinnng. It's been a long time since Ive actually been in what I could really call a relationship and it feels great. Being with him makes me so happy and it helps a lot that he was my bestfriend before hand.

Thats one of my biggest fears that I just can't let go of. Behind close doors we can do whatever we want like watch stupid cartoons or whatever but the second we are back at school or out someone where people might see us I want to push you far away and pretend Im not with you. Which is shitty of me to say the least, its just that everyone thinks we are dating and we aren't. Just really good friends, who hangout like every effing day of our lives, which Im kinda sick of. I miss my other friends. But I never have the time. I dkn. We'll see."

Im trying so hard to stand on that stool, and on my tiptoes to reach it but its still just out of reach. 
I mean I am happy now. 
Most definetly. 
But I just want this one thing...
Then things would be perfect. 
Im trying, I really am...
almost there. 
I also realized the people I hang out with has changed drastically. 
And sometimes I miss the old days...but I have new ones to make up for them. 
And quite honestly I feel like even though there are less friends there are more good memories vs. bad drama ones. 
This year is something Im just trying to make it through...
And so far...its been one of the best...except freshman year. 
Lots of fun times. 
Now Im just rambling...and the thing that sent me off on this ramble...
is someone I hold dear and near...
but yup. 
Done now. Even though this makes no sense to anyone but me."

It's sad.

I had an AMMMAAZZZIIINGG night last night.

"event","Ok so this week has been a bit insane. Ive just been completely nervous and weird around Ryan...who I now am officially with. I feel bad because I kinda ignore him in school...I dont want to. I want to walk up to him and be like ""Hey whats going on?"" ""Hows your day going?"" Stuff like that but I just get really nervous. And Lately Ive been really shy and normally Im not. I have no idea whats going on there. I guess Im just afraid to like let go of everything. Although Thursday I finally let go of some of these feelings and him and I had a good moment. Same with yesterday. I just let go of all my nervousness(word?) and went to his game when I wasn't even going to. It turned out to be fun cause a lot of my friends were there and at the end I got a sweaty kiss goodbye. So Im just gonna let go. And be myself...which hes already seen a long time ago. Im also gonna stop thinking about what everyone else thinks...Wow. I just love listening to Greg and Sam. 

In other news. Im doing so much better in school than I was last semester and it really makes me happy. Im still fighting with my mom and sister. I haven't heard from my Dad in like 2 weeks. And I can't get a hold of him so I dont know whats going on there. But other than that not much is going on. Just trying to live this day by day till things get better."

"event","So last night turned out to be a bit of a blast for me. I got to see people I havnet seen in forever. Such as Greg, Lily, and Amber. I had tons of fun hanging with Amber and Lily...and of course Chelsie. I also got to talk to my friend Brandy and smooth things out between us. Because I really don't hate her for breaking me and Darius up...It was my fault...so it wouldve happened sooner or later...and if in the same position i wouldve done the same exact thing. So can't blame her. Plus I missed talking to her. Uhm I also got to hang with the boy I mentioned in my last post...and I must say it was the cutest thing. We finally held hands...haha I sound like Ive never dated before...but its been a while so yeah. I really like him. Im determined not to mess it up. I also determined to get my whole life back on track. The new semester is starting Tuesday so it give me a chance to redeem myself academically this year...especially in that Damn Precalc class...Uhm Im also gonna try and atleast be able to talk to my mom about somethings...without fighting. Although Im still gonna live with my grandparents. Uhm Im gonna call my dad more often because I miss him horribly. And my stepmom and stepsister. I dkn. I just don't want to be miserable anymore...or make anyone else miserable...some of you might say this whole thing is bullshit, but its not. And I will prove it to you when i see you again. 

Well got to go its football sunday and I have to spend it with my family...because well its what we do on Sundays..."

"event","Its been a really long time since I posted on here. Way over a year. Its 2007 and so much has changed for me. Im no longer with Darius. That relationship lasted exactly 2 years and 2 months. Its been hard for me to move on but Im slowly working on it. I have lost and gained many friends. Im trying so hard to let things go and to fix things. Ive fucked up a lot. I won't deny it. Im a bitch and I did lie to him. Im working to change my attitude though. I don't want to lose another person close to...especially one I love. Currently though I am happy. Im kinda interested in someone and he I guess feels the same way. Weve been hanging out. Im determined not to mess it up because he also happens to be a good friend. Im still a little confused though. I don't really know what I want to do and I don't want to pursue anything yet at the risk I might hurt him. But if I wait I chance losing him. I dkn. Life is just confusing all together. It seems that a lot of people are going through break ups and stuff recently. I just hope they have friends like mine who are there to talk to no matter how late you call. 

Anyways some other things that changed are...I don't have a job. But I am applying to another one tomorrow. I lost my job at hanafords which I guess is a good thing because I don't get along with many of the ppl who work there such as Ashley and Darius. So yea. Hopefully I get another one soon because I want to get a car. 

I also moved in with my grandparents I no longer live with my mom. I couldn't take the stress anymore and I felt it was unfair to her and my sister to always be at eachothers throats. I like living with my grandparents. Its pretty awesome. Well I got to go."

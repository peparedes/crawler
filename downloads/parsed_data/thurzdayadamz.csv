"event","&ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; she asked me, &ldquo;How do you live alone and survive without falling into that lonesome pit of solitary depression?&rdquo;

That she was asking me was interesting enough I suppose. I&rsquo;m easily thirty years her junior and her life experience usually lent itself to me ask her for advice. But this incidence was unique in our encounters. Unique and somewhat disheartening.

I had fallen prey to another&rsquo;s mid-life crisis and as such was living in a small house with my two children doing the everyday things that a parent does, but I did do it alone. I had no partner to speak to in the depths of the night. I had to stay healthy when everyone else was ill. I was the only person who paid bills or called the plumber. I did things alone.

She, my neighbour, was a recent widow after being married longer than I had been alive and today was the day I had come over to offer her some of my surplus dinner. (I had made too much on purpose so that I could come and offer her the &lsquo;extra tattie&rsquo; from the pot.)

So over an obligatory cup of tea she asked me this heart felt question that changed the dynamic between the two of us.

I sipped my tea and then formed an answer. &ldquo;What you need to do is remember you lived alone before him. Remember your life before it was lived as part of a team. If you had the strength to do it before, you definitely have the strength to do it now.&rdquo;

I reached out and grabbed her hands. &ldquo; There were time when he was by your side and you were alone then too. Take strength in the fact that you survived loneliness living with someone. That is the worst kind, that is the kind the eats your soul up.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am lucky I guess, that I was left alone so young, at a time where I have to live for the kids before myself. But that is hard too, because I didn&rsquo;t get to feel alone. But you have the joy of it, the room to stretch and breathe and feel alone or no feel alone as your choice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh there are the terrible things to it as well, now there is no one to blame if the door isn&rsquo;t locked at night before bed. Now I am always the first one in the shower on a cold November morning, and a hot water bottle doesn&rsquo;t have arms to hug you back. But these things are bearable.&rdquo;

I stopped then, I stopped to drink my tea a little and I stopped so that I wouldn&rsquo;t preach. I&rsquo;ve sat in her seat before and I know sometimes that when you sit in that new lonely place you want answers but hearing them is something all together different."

Man I am a doop.
anyway, no Internet, so we'll wing this one.
Pieces of my old life are falling back into place inside my head and I'm thinking in fantastic patterns again, the key point is last time I felt like this I had no life experience, well no romantic life experience.
So let's see how the Adamz has matured shall we?<hr>


Liz and Darren a re back in place in my head, lets see how long they stay there.
I am understanding Liz's life a bit better and though Darren is still foggy we shall see how his story progresses.

I'm going to try something new, something recommended in a few of the ""how to write"" books I've read, mainly I'm just going to plod on and not worry about consistency. I'm just going to write the scenes in my head. that being said I NEED a word processor program.

"event","I have a memory of a dark and dusty corner.
Inside it is where I used to hide my dreams
Of sunlight and merriment
Of safe arms and whiskered cheeks
My neglected corner held such beauty

Beyond that room was a souless void
that sucked the life out of everything that entered.
It was there I had to return, after I hid my dreams
Dark and fragmented I sat there waiting
For what I do not know

How I escaped that world I can't remember
Why I left is too obvious to say
That I've gone back a few times is true
But my dreams have stayed locked and barred
The void sucking my spirit 

I'm tired of the memory
I'm exausted by that place
inside those untidy corners 
is where I want to be
Living in those dreams of youth

The void keeps me away
I don't dare cross that room again
it means I have to give up those dreams
so many lost to the struggle
it hurts

Can I create more
I am unsure
the void may be recreated as well
I still crave those arms
I still yearn with unshed tears.

Time will tell
My quest may follow
Knowlege is the original sin
Take the gift from my hand
Spin it round your soul."

"event","Here I present a Original story written in an original Universe, all created by me.
Please don't take it and claim it is yours. It just isn't nice seeing as I'm not getting paid for it.
I would like to one day use this Universe to get paid... we shall see.

Un-Beta'd and a touch rough. Here is <lj-cut text=""Ilthgar""> Ilthgar

It was time for the festival. It was always time for a festival for Stangar and his <i>ilthgar</i>, his clan, but for the people of Port Clomcia it was time for the festival.
 
For Stangar's ilthgar had arrived, as they always did after the first full moon in midsummer. They arrived in the middle of the night and set up their camp quietly. By dawn the next day tents and markets had been placed had sprouted like wild flowers in the field; coloured banners and bunting decorated the wagons and temporary corrals, everyone in the ilthgar was dressed in brightly coloured clothes and gaudy jewels.
 
Everywhere the ilthgar travelled they brought with them festivity and excitement. They were a travelling people who walked and danced their way from one end of the land to the other and back again, trading gossip as easily as they traded baubles and spices.
 
In Port Clomcia, the Clan was looking forward to semi precious gems taken from the sea, for salted fish and rare glass to take with them on their travels. The people of Port Clomcia traded for spices, horse flesh and exotic pets that were uncommon in their city. The people of the city also came to the clan to have their fortunes told by elderly women with blackened teeth, to watch the men dance the deadly <i>Tarango</i> and the younger women dance the <i>Hongra,</i> a dance of fertility. 
 
Inside the most colourful of the wagons, Stangar was oblivious to all but his task at hand.  He slipped on his tunic and picked up <i>spandula,</i> his circular knives with a leather wrapped bar down the centre. As he flexed his fingers round the handle he felt the leather on his left knife slide a little. The leather needed to be replaced or he would lose his grip on the blade during the dance - something he did not want to do.
 
Some dancers neglected their spandula; letting them dull, or allowing the wrappings loosen. Those dancers often lost their knives or, even in some cases, fingers or other parts as the curved blades slipped from their hands and flew out to injure their negligent owners. Lamina was a harsh mistress and if her dancers treated her with disrespect she was cruel and vengeful. 
 
While Stangar worshiped none of the gods he respected them all; especially <i>Lamina,</i> the goddess of fertility and war, the mistress of dance. He used her gifts often and did not want to offend the temperamental goddess.
 
Stangar grabbed some fresh leather lacing and started to rebind his spandula when his father knocked at the wagon's door before walking in. At 6 ft 2 he was slightly shorter than his son but Mantin shared many of his features with his offspring. Dark unruly hair, slanted green eyes that shone with delight and a ready smile were shared by both men. 
 
Stangar was broader in the shoulder than his father and carried his weight lightly as a natural dancer. Both father and son were the best dancers of the Tarango in all of the ilthgar across the land. Together their dance drew crowds from all over.
 
""They've set up the ring lad. You ready?"" Mantin said eyeing his son. He watched as Stangar carefully wrapped the leather around one more time before securing it. He nodded and stood up, blades flashing in the light from the narrow windows. As father and son walked from the wagon to the ring a cheer rose up into the air.
 
Bells and drums rose to a crescendo as a thin fiddle sliced through the sound. More people started to cheer as a weedy voice caressed the notes and the bells started to move a little slower.
 
The women were dancing first, tempting the audience with their slashed and tattered skirts. Moving back and forth using their hips in time to the hypnotic beat the women displayed the sensuality that dominated the Hongra. Nanra and the other young women of the ilthgar were now surrounded by the conservative citizens of the city, taunting and tempting them with the dance that only offered a glimpse of heaven but no invitation.
 
Those who looked upon the dancers were enchanted. The men watched, captive under the spell, wanting to possess these wild nymphs of the dance, spurred on by something primal in the rhythm of the drums. The women wanted to be these free creatures, unhindered by any worries, alive in a way that these women had not felt in a long time. 
 
Dark haired women of varying ages but all able to bear children moved in around the circle showing a flash of skin here, a barefoot jangled with an anklet there. 
 
As the music continued to pulse around the dancers and those who looked on, everyday life was forgotten and once more the townspeople were as free as those they desired and envied. The dance embodied youth and vibrancy and called to the goddess to bless the dancers with sensuality and vigour.
 
Stangar got to the edges of the ring and watched as Nanra danced. He only had eyes for her in that crowd. She embodied everything that was wonderful about the people in the ilthgar. Lively and free with dark untamed hair, smooth skin and bright eyes, Nanra could charm anyone with a look.
 
His heart swelled again as he thought about her, Nanra could have chosen anyone in the clan, anyone anywhere, but she had chosen him. Stangar was not the best horse trainer in the ilthgar, nor was he the best story teller; his skills were moderate but he could dance, and so could she. Nanra loved the dance, and loved to watch him dance as well. 
 
When she danced the Hongra, she danced it for him and no one else. Her movements in time, and in between the beat, were a call to Stangar. She wanted him as no other woman could have him and she desired him as more than just a partner in this life. When she danced she called the gods down upon her to unite her and Stangar, her lover and chosen mate in this life and all others. Her dance was more than just movement to please the town folks, her dance was a prayer.
 
Nanra danced with the other worldly grace that most zealots understand, she transcended space and time with her body and clung to the pure moment of being.
With the simplest push of her hips she wooed and caressed; with every foot step on the soil she created life. Stangar saw his future children in those movements, her felt their songs.
His sons would be tall like him; dark and strong, his daughters would be gentle and have the womanly grace that Nanra herself possessed. All of them would be proud and fierce like the clan and would understand the seasons and the land better than any of the people who tied themselves to the cities.
 
Wild and free, flesh was exposed to the air for a fleeting second then covered again by a scrap of skirt. Bells chimed in the air anointing the dancers calling the gods to witness. The dance moved rapidly to the fevered climax with the women all throwing their heads back and chest to the sky. Midriffs were exposed as the women started to spin and twist. Together and never touching the women moved in a circle doubled over rotating in a sinuous movement. Women and men both gasped at this show of endurance and flexibility from the dancers. The bells on every woman's ankles stopped as one and they all let out a single call to the goddess.
 
 ""<i>Lamina Marough Isa Ghan</i>,"" Lamina's blessings upon us.
At this final call coins filled the air and landed at the dancers' dusty feet. The women bend down and picked up a handful of coins each, and some of the more brazen dancers flirted with men in the circle, trying to coax more money from the spectators.
 
No clanswoman would debase herself to offer more than a flirtation for money; she had her honour and respect. Lamina's blessing should not be given for coin, it should be given freely. The city folk didn't understand the difference between a woman choosing her lover and a woman hiring herself for coin but there was a difference, and to make sure that the difference was noted there were strong men in the crowd to persuade the persistent men to look else where.
 
The circle was cleared of the coins now and Mantin walked in through the crowd. As they saw the circled blades in his hands the city folk went quiet. Stangar followed his father into the circle, the light bounced off his blades.
 
The soft ""tsh tsh"" of the <i>Bausmerb</i> whispered through the air as both men bowed to each other and took their first stance.  The hand drums started their rapid beat and the Bausmerb started a deep thrum as a thin and weedy Ocarina started to whistle.
 
Stangar moved his left hand in front of his eyes effectively blocking his vision and opening himself to attack, while his father dropped his left hand down to his knees.
As the drums slowed the men started to move.
 
Clockwise they circled each other moving the blades back and forth in the air. Then Mantin leapt toward his son, his spandula aimed to Stangar's throat.  Stangar dropped his left leg and bent backwards out of reach of the deadly blade. 
 
Stangar brought up his left blade to attack his father's arm when Mantin rolled his hand backwards and above his head.  Back and forth the men sparred almost touching each other with the deadly blades, never making real contact but only through the skill of the dancers was no one hurt.
 
It was then that Mantin raised the stakes, leaping in a large circle from one foot to another he spun around his son and used his blades to slice the tunic off Stangar's shoulders. 
 
The useless garment fell to the dirt as Stangar stood bare chest in the sun. He crossed his arms in front of himself and looked down. Then his head snapped up and he locked eyes with his foe. 
 Stangar dropped to the ground, the blades still in his hands and he put all of his weight on them. He bounded hand over feet to the edge of the circle before snapping upwards with his right blade and slicing his father's tunic length wise, from groin to sternum.
 
Sweat was making the dancer's skin shine in the bright sunshine and made their hair cling to their foreheads and nape of their necks. Bare-chested and tanned they were the symbol of virility moving back and forth in this deadly dance. Lamina had blessed these two men, father and son, with her most attractive of gifts. 
 
A body each that moved with grace and fluidity. A body that contained honour and pride, a gentle heart and the strength to defend what so ever that heart desired. Lamina was the goddess of the family and of the hunt; she killed as easily as she gave life. Her dance whispered of her gifts and powers and these two were the perfect dancers of the Tarango. 
 
The dance ended when both men stood face to face with their vicious blades at each other's throats. The crowd cheered and threw coins on the sand with whistles and screams. The two men lowered their lades and bowed first to each other, then to the crowd before shouting into the air the call of the men to the Goddess.
 
 ""<i>Lamina Marough Isas Ghoo</i>!"" Lamina has blessed us.
 
Father and son then embraced and walked out of the circle arm and arm letting the boys of the clan to collect the coins. Their blades clutched loosely in on hand."

"event","I'm here in PEI and I've been thinking so yeah; random fiction coming up.
<lj-cut>
He was so quiet in his youth. Really as a baby he never cried, as a toddler there were no tantrums. I can still see those big innocent eyes that told me so much with so little noise.
His eyes were dark and exploring, you could tell he saw so much more of the world.
Then my world shattered as a ""doctor"" told me he was not right, not <i>normal</i>.
I didn't believe him at first, children who are not normal make a fuss, they scream all the time, didn't sleep the nights through. My baby was quiet and understanding. He was quiet but he <i>listened</i>. That was totally different from being not right, that was how we all were to be. Wasn't it?
We're told to listen, to reach out, to help, to understand. My perfect baby did all these things instinctively with out being told. There is no way he wasn't right.

But they insisted it wasn't normal to have a quiet baby, it wasn't right to have a child focus on the world around him so intently that he tries to help an ant to a  shorter path.

The ""doctor"" gave me pills, told me to poison my child to make him ""normal"". I threw them away.
The teachers wrote reports about his behaviour, neighbours questioned my care of him.

I was weak, I gave in and started to believe.
I gave him his pills, I coaxed him to become dependant on chemicals and to learn to be selfish because the world wanted him that way.

Now he is no longer quiet, he doesn't care about the world around him.
The ""doctors"" say it is a phase he'll grow out of it. 
My neighbours and the teachers sigh and ask themselves what I did to him to make him so self centred. ""She spoiled him"" they say. 
""The boy had no discipline."" 
""He needs to learn to respect others around him.""

Now he turns to more drugs, not the kind you can get over the counter in some sterile shop, but the kind you get in a dirty back alley.
I'm scared, I fear I've lost the perfect baby to this lost man.
His eyes are still dark and big, but not so innocent.

They still speak to me though.

They ask me to help him."

Crochetqueen7: What it means to the goddess and if one of the woman are supposed to be the embodiement of the goddess</b>


ahh well that I have yet to figure out, mentioning Lamina was a way of letting the reader know that there are numerous gods in this world. but as of yet they don't really feature in the day to day running of the land.
The dance really is just me trying to ground the reader, make them see the magic in the gypsy people, the joy in the dance, the bliss there is to just BE and also establish the pysicall prowess of our hero.
I mean He is a HUNK of a man, what's more he's deeply and truely in love which makes him more delish.

Crochetqueen7: Dude is he two feet tall?
Crochetqueen7: That is like so what I thought I read
Mizz Adamz: no my 6 key sticks
Crochetqueen7: Or have I lost my mind
Crochetqueen7: LOL
Mizz Adamz: he's 6ft 2
Crochetqueen7: See I am a crazy bastard. LOL
Mizz Adamz: see my 6 I really have to bang
Crochetqueen7: OHHHH The 6 was missing
Crochetqueen7: ??? 
Crochetqueen7: OHHHH
Crochetqueen7: I thought you were going into the gutter with that comment
Crochetqueen7: LOL
Crochetqueen7: Have to bang the 6 LOL
Crochetqueen7: I love the dance idea though. I think it shows that they really love their way of life
Crochetqueen7: and it gives the towns people something to envy
Mizz Adamz: whish is was I want, I am a towns person and I envy the ilthgar their freedom, but even in their freedom they have constraints.. if I ever write the novel that will have to come through"

"event","How does one describe the intensity of a dance?
How do you tell the reader about the pulse of the music? How do you tell the reader the intenstiy of derisre you are to feel when you catch the flash of an ankle through slashed skirts?
tell me how to describ the undulations of a woamn's hips. Tell me how to draw the eye to her wrists with words, and noticed that no matter how much she moves and calls to you you cant have her?
How do I make that desire known, felt, smelt and consume you with poor words?
I have had this dance in my mind for ages, yet everytime I try to write it is is so pale in comparison to the image in my head.
I can close my eyes and see how the tangles in her hair stick to her face and how... alluring that is, but I can't really tell anyone it.
Or can I?
This is working, but it isn't following the tone of my story, maybe I just need  to write it and then worry about consitancy later.
The dance is so much more than physicall movement, so few peole know this; but this dance, like all dances is a communication to the primal beast inside of us. Tthe one that was around before vocalisation, before words and beliefs, there was just flesh and <i>now</i>.
My dance, the <i>Hongra</i> draws on all of that. I want to reach out and pull the inner animal and make it real for a heart beat or two to make the reader remember what it was like not to reason, but just <b>Be</b>.

Delusions of grandure maybe? I don't know. I never planned on being one to write in a way that was so profound and artisitic, but this is waht I feel, what I dream my writting can do.

There are times when I wish I understood music more than I do, this could be done so easily with music. But with words..... it isnt so easy.

Well I'll keep trying because <i>Kal Ho Na Ho</i>."

"event","When writing in a fantastic universe you need a tool, something to make the reader realise they aren't in Kansas any more. Now in my story I won't have dragons, I wont have flying cars, I won't have much to make the reader realise that this is a different world/time frame. That is until I figured out LANGUAGE.
Yep i've created a few words in my own language that will filter in and out of my story/ universe to transport the reader. 
When Is tarted this idea for this universe, almost 3 years ago, I knew I needed a language, and I was trying to great an entire language with gramatic rules, origins etc..
For someone who barely scraped through English, let alone her compulsory French this was a hard task I am no scholar of language at all. Heck I can barely play a decent game of scrabble.
But then I realised as I sat down to actually write this short story that I don't need all those  gimics, I am using words, not entire sentences. I'm not trying to re-write Tolkien, I don't need a fanatical fan base learning to speak the language. I just need a handful of words that WORK in my head.

I've always know that when it comes to language I don't think the way we are taught to think, so my made up words do sound other worldly.. that is the only tool I need."

"event","Well I've sused my Writter's block I've figured out what is going wrong.
My characters are too whingy, the internal monologuing is dragging me down.
I need to stop the painful thought processed and just write actions for a bit. If need be I can go back and add the internal monologueing again.

Now I just need my new Hard Drive to arrive so that I can get all my written stuff off the Disc and get back to writing!
Hazaah!!

Anyone out there have oppinions on my repetative monlogues that they think I need to tweak?
Please?"

<lj-cut text=""Conversations with Darren"">
(Darren is italicised)
Darren, why?

<i>Why what Love?</i><i></i>

Quit being so smug you flirtatious bastard, why did you do it?

<i>That why... You do pick the hard ones don't you?</i>

Well?

<i>Well what love? Why did I take Liz's heart out of her chest and stomp on it and then throw mine in the trash beside hers? What did it take for me to hurt the one I love, body and soul?  Easy I was stupid.</i>

Stupid? Does that sum it up? Just one word?

<i>OF COURSE IT DOES! I was an idiot, selfish and childish. I really had no clue what it was to be deigned anything. I was sheltered and loved so wholly I was naive. When the opportunity presented itself to me I didn't think about what I had to loose, because it had always been there for me. I didn't know it could go away. 
                    Liz was always there,
                                   <font size=""-2"">and I threw her away</font></i>

You regret it?

<i>Does the moon shine? OF COURSE I REGRET IT! She was the purest thing I have ever found, will ever find. She knows me inside out and took me as I was. She never judged me, she was never cruel. Being near her was perfection and the memories I have still move me to tears. I threw that away when I let one groupie try and ""earn"" her backstage pass.</i> 

You seduced a Fan?

<i>No, not really she threw herself at me, she was young and dolled up like a pretty whore. She said she really could be my biggest fan and unzipped my jeans.</i> 

Oh..woah stud... save something for the book...

<i>Yeah well one of Liz's school friends saw and ratted and BOOM it was gone.</i>

Do you only feel badly because you were caught?

<i>Christ no! Don't you get it? I betrayed Liz's trust, the trust of the one who would have stood by me through anything. I violated everything between us for a lousy blow job that didn't even get finished.</i>

No?

<i>No I pushed the girl off of me and drove to the nearest bar trying to wash the guilt out of my mouth. One of the band came and took me home, but I wasn't that drunk that I don't remember how beautiful she looked on our, her bed asleep with a congratulations banner over her head.
                                                                   <font size=""-2"">I was a shit.</font></i> 

Darren;

<i>Look Babe, this is really putting a down on things I'm going to jet.</i>

Bye Darren"

<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Are you feeling at least a little better
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> groggy, very groggy and I am TRYING to write but little comes out
Crochetqueen7: I just can't seem to get there any more. Not to the place I used to be when I wrote. I just lack the joy I once had in my life. Sad I know. But it is true. 
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> What have you written? Anything you want me to llok at?
makes sense, she would see you putting too much value in waht people deem your work worthm instead of what you like in it
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> lol
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Yeah I know
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> just the bits I have about Liz's Dream in thurzday Adamz
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> But really what else am I to do. I have a dead end job that I hate and there is no way I can get another that will pay as well.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Will have to go check it out 
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I've done character outlines, half the plot outline, and posted my play list
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I have soemthing in my note book but I don't know if I will keep it
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> I saw the character outline
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Why not?
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Liz is just musing
<b>Crochetqueen7</b>: OH
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I don't liek the way it turned out.. Not Liz but me...
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> it's int he sewing room one sec
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> maybe you could rework it not toss it
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> k
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Okies here we go
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> k
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Liz was tired of his games, tired of his protests of innocence. Darren cheated and lies to her. That made him the bad guy.
Nevermind what her body said, ignoring the pull she felt when she saw him across the room.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Darren is not a nice guy already.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> That was just horemones, her body craving the closeness they once shared. A physical memory and nothing more.
She had to remind herself what he had done to her. The his selfish behaviour had led him to shatter her heart and ruin any trust she once had for him
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Even if it had been 7 years afo, even if he had shown her nothingt to tell her he was still the selfish boy.
Lately he had been the image of decorm. Not advancing on her since she told him to stay away. Never hinting that there had been anything more than a casual freindship between them.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> wow keep it coming I feel like I am reading Danielle Steel
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> that to me is a good thing. :-)
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> No, it was her own body betraying her this time, her eyes wanted to see him, her nose wanted his scent int he air. Her breath hitched when she heard his voice and his touch, oh the mear thought of his casual touch turned her stoamche into a hive of emiotion. Her palms started to sweat and her mouth went dry.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Her body craved the casual closeness it once shared with Darren. Liz felt like a teanager again, lost and confused, and liek that troubled stage in her life Darren was at the heart of her turmiol.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> But the adult Liz needed to remind herself that the once child-woman Liz died at Darren's hand broken and betrayed. Once should not forget that no matter waht the body said.
Liz slept fitfully and got up in the early housr to try and write. She had a deadline and her editor would not apprciate a late book. The world didn't wait on a sleepless night.
<b>Crochetqueen7</b>: WOW this Darrwn guy is trouble for her. SHe can't even like think or sleep.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> I like
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> But.. I don't know. fist thing Liz IS a novel writer, yes, but her mother had just died so she will be taking a break from work anyway...
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> ok, so how does darren if in?
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I make Darren look so evil no one will want him to be a part of Liz's life
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Yeah but isn't it true that even the most evil of is can find redemption? Isn't that why so many people love Snape or Erik?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> You are doing great
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> but that is a long developed story.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I mean t he book starts off with Liz in love with Darren then Chapter one.. she barely stands him.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> So your's will be long and developed when it is finished. Have you done a character study on Darren? Why did he cheat? Why did he break her heart?
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> HE cheated becasue he could.. he was a selfish boy
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> he wanted fame, wanted glory and followed his own selfish desires
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> But WHY??? Did he leave her behind because his mother was a problem? There you have it he was selfish
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> NOW, he repents, he's grown a bit
<b>Mizz Adamz</b>: no.. he dreams of being a star, the girl he slept with was a groupie
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> yeah but did he really love her then? I think not! I think it is now that he loves her?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> The NIG question is can Liz trust him again. 
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> he's always loved her, but he didn't know waht love realyl meant till he lost Liz, the fool thought he could get away with it
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Remember love cannot live where there is no trust
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> She will learn to
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> he holds her up as she buries her mother, confronts her step-father
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> What is the whole plot? What is the main delima?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Her trusting him? Or something else?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> I think his actions will speak for his heart. I just don't know if I would believe him again. But that is me not liz.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> the plot is Liz.. her devlopement, her renual in trust in not only Darren but herself to being part of the outside world again.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Ok, now you said you start off with Liz in love with Darren right?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> they are kids then I guess
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I know people can cange and I HOPE I can convey that Darren has changedm that is my challenge
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> young adults
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> living together...
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> ok, what if you don't put that first
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> what if you have liz think back on it all
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> sorta like a flash back but not
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> we will, first is the prologue of Darren coming home froma  tour of venues and liz has a romantic evening set up, but he is late, hint at sex and then fade into black
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> wow is this SF?
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> cool!!!!
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> Chapter one Liz is looking out at a strom rolling in off the coast, getting ready for the funeral and wake for her motehr when Darren turns upa nd she give him the cold shoulder, sighs and stops fighting long enough to invite him in and give hima  cup of coffee. she sits far away from his and suddenly bursts into tears.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> OMG!!! that will be a strong first chapter.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> I like it
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> we get a bit of story about how she doesn't need him, he comforts her through her crying jag, then he leaves and as he does he appologises and swears he would change it all.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> As he drives off she says Too little to late Darren.
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> OHHHHHH. I am crying now. Thank you.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b><b></b> I am cut and pasting all of this into LJ btw
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> I really think you have something here. How much do you have written
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> K 
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> It is wonderful and you should put it in your lj.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I wrote the first 4 chapters YEAR ago but lost them...
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I'm trying to piece thing back together
<b>Crochetqueen7:</b> Damn I would have loved to read what you had.
<b>Mizz Adamz:</b> I wish I could find it.."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Liz ruminating... mid story"">Liz was tired of his games, tired of his protests of innocence. Darren cheated and lies to her. That made him the bad guy.
Never mind what her body said, ignoring the pull she felt when she saw him across the room.
 That was just hormones, her body craving the closeness they once shared. It was a physical memory and nothing more.
She had to remind herself what he had done to her. The his selfish behaviour had led him to shatter her heart and ruin any trust she once had for him
Even if it had been 7 years ago, even if he had shown her nothing to tell her he was still the selfish boy.
Lately he had been the image of decorum. Not advancing on her since she told him to stay away. He never hinted that there had been anything more than a casual friendship between them.
No, it was her own body betraying her this time, her eyes wanted to see him, her nose wanted his scent in the air. Her breath hitched when she heard his voice and his touch, oh the mere thought of his casual touch turned her stomach into a hive of emotion. Her palms started to sweat and her mouth went dry.
 Her body craved the casual closeness it once shared with Darren. Liz felt like a teenager again, lost and confused, and like that troubled stage in her life Darren was at the heart of her turmoil.
But the adult Liz needed to remind herself that the once child-woman Liz died at Darren's hand broken and betrayed. Once should not forget that no matter what the body said.
Liz slept fitfully and got up in the early hours to try and write. She had a deadline and her editor would not appreciate a late book. The world didn't wait on a sleepless night."

Me in regular
<i>Liz in italics</i>

Liz, what do you want to see in life? How do you want to see the world?

<i>Well really I'm the one who starts things aren't I? I just move things forward and force people to act. I hate stagnation, I hate being still and listless. I wan people to know they can move forward, that taking action isn't always a bad or forceful thing. </i>

Do we need to go into your past with Darren? I mean he really hurt you.

<i>Darren is a part of my life, past present and future, Yeah I want him there. I do love him even if he is a jack ass at times. </i>

But Liz, what is your story? I mean the genre isn't all flowers and bunnies; it isn't a ROMANTIC story really.

*she shrugs* <i>I don't know, it's a story that needs to be written doesn't it? Do we need to put in a box? I am living my life and Darren walks into it just as things turn chaotic. I needed him and he showed up... that is good enough. The story does follow our relationship to a small extent, but to the BIGGER part this story is about me, my views of the world and how I deal with my demons.</i>

Like and yours and Darren's history, and how you feel about your mother alienating you? That sort of thing.

<i>Yeah, Your grammar bothers me by the way. </i>

Shuddap... not all of us are so gifted with languages.

*laughs* <i>well you have Word's tools, that will get you by for now; I'll try and help you. </i>

Liz, you are in MY head, I have limited language abilities... deal with it.

<i>I am by forcing you to improve. </i>

This is not working, I need to get this story on the role... nit picking my grammar isn't helping.

*she laughs again* <i>Oh yes it is. </i>

Ok, fine maybe it is. You are a stubborn pest you know that.

<i>Thank you. </i>"

Neither is conciousness, those of us who have gyestated in the womb have not suddenly become aware of our needs and desires.
No awares grew within like the dim light of an electric lamp slowly growing in brightness until it consumes itself and then bursts into a cosmic ideal.
We mear mortals, who are so much more than what labels can give us, begin and end out creation thus.
Others... are different...

then came his purpose.
To live, to love, to learn,
but never end

Saddening isn't it?"

ok I am at a loss as to what to do with Sarah and Jareth, they are being really un cannon and not what I wanted them to be in the first place.
Right now I am working on the ""story"" yes the one that tells of Jareth and Dee's relationship.
at first I thought, well I'll tell it all. then a light went on, if it is all out there what is there left to read? No I need the mystery. Now I am trying to figure out what to tell, what is enough to wet the appetites of the reader and what is too much.
What about Sarah and her Hissy fits? Really she is getting on my nerves, one minute she trusts him enough to cry on his shoulder and then she is calling him every name in the book from player to sadist and back again, and really not being very lady like at all.

I understand her anger comes from fear, but what is Jareth to do? Flirt? Act nonchalant? Shrug his shoulders and feel guilty.
HELL no the arrogant so and so CANNOT act guilty. We had a momet of weakness already, can't have more so soon. Not over a hissy fit.
No, Sarah needs a splash of cold water in the face, a smack down...
Oh yes much better....

"event","Who is Jareth? What is his history?
I don't like having him as the goblin king, it is a cold cruel personal and really I don't feel it is a loveable character. In SrSs I want Jareth to be a romantic hero, all his arrogance aside. For that he needs to be something more.
Jareth is a character, a creation of all the dreamers in the world. Some time, an entire community thought of this one being, a man who would be able to fulfil one woman's dreams in a life time. Out of the ether Jareth was born. Group consciousness is a wonderful thing.
But he is different for every dreamer, he changes to suit her, it is part of his powers. Sarah wanted the Goblin King so he became the king of the creatures and had a labyrinth. Where are the goblins now? We shall see..
Previous dreams saw Jareth in different lights, and he became what they wanted.
His existence is dependant on the dreamer, he can survive on the rements of the dreamer until another can be found, but it is a vague existance.
Jareth has the ability to slow time down to keep his dreamer with him, but he can't stop it.
His dreamer can live with him for almost 100 years, though she will age.
Because of the nature of his existence he does genuinely love the dreamer. who doesn't love their creator and sole reason for being? Though I am curious as to if this can be called a true love or one born out of necessity, that will be explored later.
Jareth has but one purpose in life, to harvest the dreams of the dreamer and keep her with him for her life time. He is a parasite, but a loving and kind one.
Do I like this Jareth? Not really I pity the poor lad and we shall see where my pity takes him."

"event","what am I after when I wirte? is it a personal expression? a way to fill that empty void I feel in my chest? well it started out that way, now I want to write becasue I feel i can't do anything else.
ideas are in my head all the time, I see things that aren;t there,  i hear plot lines in the wind. wirting is me. it can't define me, it can't complete me, becuase that inplies it isn't in me already.
Ok I am not published right now, but I still write.
Yes writing is me and i can't be me if I don't do it. Prolly part of this ache in me and my recient dark spell is becasue I have neglected it for so long. heck I rarely write in my real LJ these days. I need to.

What am I after with srss? I want the attnetion and fan base that I see others running from, I want the attention, but I also want to proove to myself that I can do it, I can write a complete story that is worth reading. ok I am borrowing characters, I am stealling ideas, but if I can do it this way thenthe next one that is totally mine will be easier right?

nah, it won't be but I will enjoy it more.
synopsis:
I wirte because I have to I wouldn't be me if I didn't.
I am writing SRSS as a ground breaking for my own origianl fict.

that is good start I guess."

"event","Well not a whole lot is up in my life. between working 2 jobs its been kinda crazy. I've been averaging 14 hours of work a day. i never thought of myself as a person to be working at 530 in the morning but now i do so i can get all my work done for the day. its been weird not having much time to do much but i guess its life. So i am really glad for the weekends now. it gives me time to catch up on my sleep and then maybe have some time to do stuff with my friends who are in class. but on other good new i picked up 2 classes on unversity of pheniox online. so i will have 8 credits this semester that will transfer to NMU when i go back hopefully next winter. but we will see how that all falls out.

but for now i just got in from being out with some friends. so in a few i'm going to bed because i have a big buzz on. but what else is new

"event","well i have a new job now, so thats good seeing as tho i'm done at the bank in now 13 days.  but one thing that i found kinda funny is that he doesnt know me, and he has already started to judge me. He told me that he thinks i have a depression problem. all this is based on the fact that i dont really talk to the people i work with and the fact that he put the cd on of what i was listening to in my personal cd player. It was Metallica's black album (5th album). i mean it doesnt talk about the nicest stuff but its raw emotion. but with a lot of the things that they talk about i can really relate to. James hetfield was on to something when he was writing all this stuff.  so as for everyone they can judge me and say whatever they want. People are entitled to their own opinion, but no one will never know what i am really going through till i do something or say something to let them into what is going on in my mind.

well i think thats all i'm going to write because i dont feel like writing more"

"event","well not a whole lot has gone on this weekend. Went to the movies last nite to see American Wedding. Its a funny movie which was worth going to see if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh all through it. Then after that went around marquette and was asked to buy beer by some young girls. which was kind of awkward because i'm not 21. o well.....then today i went back to marquette to see about getting a bat ordered but johnson's sports was not really help full in that aspect so i ended up going to Dunham's sports which actually had the bat i wanted so that was great considering they had a special on all baseball stuff. so i got it for a really good price almost half off the original price of it. SO now it looks like the plan for tonight is to have some people come over and we are gonna have a lil party at my house and the beer starts flowing at 8 o'clock. so if your coming besure  to get here in time. other wise u might not get a good spot to park.

well thats all for now   nite"

It was a great nite just a great way to get whats on your chest off. tip one beer back then another and by the 3rd on its time to start talking about whats on your mind. it might not solve the worlds problems but it sure does help us to get everything out in the open and you get to solve whats bothering you. so after a case and a half then a pint of jack daniels, we were really drunk so it was time to head home for bed. so we both went to our houses to sleep off the nite and that brings us to saturday. well that was basically just a day to do nothing. then i went to see him that nite and say our good byes because he leaves on sunday at 6am to head back to seattle. so i wont get to talk to him till he gets back there in a couple days.

Ignorin everyone to spend time with his new gf, which is kinda pathetic in its way. But other than that a best freind of mine came back from on leave from Washington state where he is stationed and hates it. But thats the life of a Marine i guess. So the last couple days have been fun and we've been doing the stuff we use to do in High school while he is home. You know the days of cruising and the late nites out partying with some of the old friends. so its been a good week so far but he leaves on sunday or monday to drive back....so that will kinda suck because we wont get to see him till he comes back on leave in like feb or so...

So jesse and i head out to the casino where we both left with what we went in with. Then saturday nite was a lil different but to make a long story short jesse and i were at one party then went to another but at the second party there was a fight that i helped to break up but during it i was hit with and empty 40 oz beer bottle that broke on my head and went down my back where i was shoved into the fridge where the peices of glass went in to my back. That sucked but it pissed me off so i got my hit in on the fat fucker that threw it at me. so i knocked him out in one punch to teach him he should choose who he pisses off better. So jesse fixed me up and stiched me up so i wasnt bleeding all over the place and went home to sleep. Sunday i had the worst headache, then i went to play some baseball and stuff. So it was a pritty calm day.  so in total that was my whole weekend and then on monday i went to work like usual then went to the movies at nite to see Pirates of the Carrabiene.

well thats about all i have to say but for now i'm out to sleep so i can go to work again tomarrow.  nite all"

A few days ago i found out that i was to be a paul barrer at my uncles funeral. and to day was the day of it. its like 85 degrees out side and we had the visitation and ceremony. then it was the processional to the cemetary for his burrieal. it was a very hard time for all. It all went good for me and my other uncles until they started to play TAPS after they gave my aunt the american flag. It was a very hard time to keep back emotions. then after that my cousins and i had to suck it up and lay him into his final resting place. But like the minister said........Today is a great day for him, he is walking hand and hand with the lord of hosts in the most friut ful place anyone can ever imagine.

I never did get to play in the  field but i did pritty good at bat. I went 1 for 2 with 3 RBI's and a HR. The home run came in the sixth inning to secure the win for out team (7-5) but now we have to play on saturday at 8:45. so thats not too bad but now i gotta go and do some more stuff around the house.

"event","Well i just got back from another weekend that started out wild. but it all came to a hault friday nite when i got a call. I went out camping and friday nite i got a call on my cell phone from one of my aunts. Its unusual for any family members to call. But it turns out that one of my uncles was in a fatal car crash on friday nite. They were coming home from the casino and on the way home ea 16 year old girl pulled out in front of them and hit the passanger door which kill my uncle instantly. Then that casued 2 other cars to crash, and in the pile up the 16 year old girl was kill when a car tired to move out of the way. So it turned from a weekend of fun to a weekend of sadness. So i called my parents and then went to where they were camping. so it stopped my weekend with they guys and i'm sorry to you guys but i had to leave to be with my family. now the funeral will be on thursday because my aunt who was in the car should be out of the hospital. But i guess every thing happens for a reason. And everyone including the pastor said it must have just been his time. To me i'm just a little confused right now to make a decision on it.

but now i think its time for me to go and possibly go to bed.

I dont know if its an obsession or just bordom. but what ever the case, i spend my time doing it and it kills the time pritty well. The reason i'm not on AIM anymore is because to many people lately have been pissing me the hell off. So i dont wanna talk to them so i just stay away from it. So i guess if people do wanna talk to me they should call, and if u dont have the number, then i guess u might wanna ask the next time u can catch me online. or else, i would just say ur fucked then if u wanna talk. but o well.  but as for me i see it that i have atleast a good week now to keep playing on line games till i have to get back into the swing of school again, then i will just be occupied with my books and stuff like that. And i guess my final thought of the day will be ""y do people tell me things i really dont care to know(like what they are ""doing"" with their life): so in part what i will say is,  females lie....alot

It really sucks major ass. Lots of looking at books and periodicals and other shit of that sort. Its ok i guess, if you like to read a lot of scientific stuff. But other than that its boring as hell. And on top of that i have to write up papers on 5 sources that i found. That is the worst thing. I has to outline what each artical/book said. But the bad thing is they cannot be internet sources. So that just makes it that much harder. So therefor it mean lots of time spent here reading and that, which will take away from my other time for studying for my other classes. So that really really sucks because i have a couple of other test coming up in the next couple of days. But i suppose, should head back and do more research,  nite"

I can only hope that some how something good will come out of all this. Right now i dont know what i can do, or what i should do. I try to do the right thing but i always seem to never do it. I dont know if its just me, or if there is some underlying thing that keeps me from not doing what i want to. I hope that things will work them selves out.

So my family and I ended up going to Applebee's for supper. It was a pritty good supper, considering i really dont like going to the place to begin with.  Then after we came home i had some family and that over for cake and coffee. So it was just a regular boring nite.  Now that brings things up to this point now.  And as it is, i'm dead tired so i think i'm gonna wrap this up and head off to bed. So good nite and talk to ya all later"

"event","well there is not a whole lot to say about my current situation and standing. The first week of class is done and i happy about that. Its been an interesting week and an even more interesting weekend. We'll start with friday: I went out with friends and didnt end up getting home till 7 am ( the quote that sums up that nite is when i said ""stop the world, i wanna get off"")  So saturday nite after i got up, i decided to not do a whole lot so i just went to the billiards to shoot some pool with a friend. It was an ok time i guess, not a whole lot to do in this town.  Then today I just sat around doing nothing. went to church, watched TV, the tampa bay game, and thats been about it. I was supposed to i guess do something with someone but they were not home when i called today, they went out with some one for the day. So i got stuck at home.

Now for the thing that has me really pissed.  I just dont know y some of my ""friends"" cant stand to see me happy. Its starting to get a lil fucking old. Everyone with their suggestions on what they would do in my situation. Its nice u want to help, but honestly, most of the time they just end up making it worse. Then i got some that just think that i'm just doing the total wrong thing. Which i find very funny coming from them when they are the ones that are setting them selves up to be hurt AGAIN in their own relationships. So if they took care of theirs first i might think of listening to them.  So now it seems that i really cant trust anyone.

Now we could get started on the one girl i like. But i'm gonna choose not to because i get so many mixed signals from her.  Most of the time they are the ones i want, but some  times i just get some that are bad.  I dont really wanna come out and ask her about it, but its eating me up in side. But i guess thats what i get when i think about it too much.  O well i guess, i just see how it works out.

Well i'm out for the nite....c ya"

"event","Well class has now begun. The first day was like most first days. It was rather boring, and pointless. But however it was nice to see all my friends that went home for break. Sunday nite i ended up going down to see kristen, and we hung out for a few hours, took a ride to ishpeming to see mya's frogs, went around. So it was a fun nite over all. We didnt get anything accomplished except for her showing me all that she got for christmas. She had gotten lots of things, mostly clothes and a pair of snow shoes. So now that will be something we can both do together.  She wants to go around marquette and other places to try to get some pictures of different winter scenes.  But thats basically all that has went on for the last couple days.  well i'm out, c ya"

"event","Well tonight was a rather interesting nite. Didnt do a whole lot. Went to Mqt, went to help a freind fix her computer [cant help when she dropped it on the floor and broke stuff] went to get something to eat and got a movie to watch. Other than that it was interesting. Its just that in a small conversation i had, it brought up lots of things that i have been thinking about for the last few hours. Not that they were said, just that it was implied in the conversation. I dont know if its me being way too conservative, or too apprehencive. I cant say for sure, but all i know is that i'm second guessing everything i thought for the last couple weeks. I'm not saying i'm backing down on what i feel, but i'm just trying to re evaluate what i feel.  see if it really what is happening or just me wanting it to happen. In a way i think that its not what tonight has lead on to be, because in other conversations with that other person it has not been like this. Maybe its just the timeing, or just me thinking too much, or her parents are here, or just all of them compiled into one. But whatever it is i need to find out what is really going on before monday. So if its the good way (the way i want) we can work on persueing it, or if its the bad way( the way i dont want) we can go our own directions and find what we both need.

but thats all i'm going to say about this now.  I'll talk to you all some time....i guess"

"event","well with only a few days left to break, its looks like i should start thinking of school. Well i've been thinking of it, and i did some changes to my schedual. I switched out of one class that i really didnt need. so thats ok, and i picked up on in place of it that i dont really need but it counts and its easy and it fits into my schedual. So it fits almost all of my criteria for a class that i want to take. It should not be all that bad of a semester. But the way it looks now, i dont have to work on fridays so that will be good. I can just spend some time with kristen down at school or we can come back to ishpeming for the weekends. It will be a nice change to be able to see her every weekend now that she doesnt have to do a lot of the other stuff that she was doing because of the club that she was in. But thats about all that i have to say for now so i will talk to you all later.  C ya"

"event","well not a whole lot has happened this week. Its been a rather peaceful week, and a rather restful week. Today i ended up helping mya set up a terarrium for her couple frogs she is getting. It gave me a few ideas for what i am going to do with the terrerium i am going to make for kristen. But it all comes down to what type of frog(s) she wants. But now with the basic idea i can start to gather some of the material i will need to build it. it should be a rather interesting project. But never the less it will be a fun project. It will give me some thing to do while i am home on break for the next week. But now i'm really wishing class was back in session. THis break has gotten very long for me. But in a week its back to the same old grind. However this semester should be more fun but tomarrow i have to look because i am going to switch a couple of my classes up, so my schedual will change a lil bit. I know that i am not taking one class now, and i am going to replace it with another. So it will be good on that part.  But its about time for me to head out so talk to ya all later.   C YA"

"event","well it happened again. Another year has passes us by. All i can say is the past year has been an interesting one. Its had its up and downs. Most of them have been downs but now i can look to the next year and hope its better.  The last few months of 2002 have been a lil better for me. And it looks that 2003 will be starting out great. the first day of this year has been a resting day. because i know as soon as school get back into session it will be trying. But there are things that have me looking forward to school getting back. Freinds will be back, classes will be different, and maybe just maybe i cant say what i really have to say to some people. ITs been hard for me to say what i should have said a long time ago. But like i said, i have building blocks for the new year.  So i hope it will be a lot better.

well i'm gonna go now,  nite"

There are some reasons i do wanna get back in session, but there are the others that make me want to stay on break a while longer. But the break has been good, now i finally feel that i have had a chance to get away from school. It just seems that i havent ever stopped going to school, o wait, thats right i have not stopped going to class.  he he. o well, maybe this year i wont take as many summer classes, but i do think i will be taking some classes. But we will just have to see when that time comes around. Well that all i'm gonna post for now, talk to ya later"

"event","well the week is finally over. yeah christmas was ok, but with all the things that have been going on its been more trouble than its worth. Now hopefully i can just manage to sit down and catch up on some well deserved sleep. It seems like that all i can do is just try to run around to keep in one place. O well i guess thats what real work is like. 

But aside from that not a whole lot has been going on.  Trying to catch up with some old friends while they are back on their breaks from the military and from other colleges. Its been a rather trying task to accomplish but i've seen almost everyone that i ment to see. and the ones i havent seen yet i will get to see on saturday, when one person is having a bunch of friends over for a party since he is home from NC where he is stationed. So that should be fun. Tip a few with friends for old times sakes, but not let anything get to far.  But just relax and have some fun.

well time is almost up so i gotta run, talk to everyone later."

Not a whole lot has been up lately.  With the semester break now, there is not a whole lot to do other than work, and hang out with friends for a while. I know its bad to say but i cant wait for school to get started.  I'm sick of not having a whole lot to do. I feel a lil guitly not having anything to do. But it will be nice to have a lil break from school i guess. well i think i will update this a lil more later.....bye"

"event","Well, I'm almost done with the week from hell.  Its been a long week but the weekend is almost here, and i can't wait.  Finals week has never really gotten to me before, but this year it seems to be getting to me alot. I've been spending alot of nites doing late studying trying to put it all together. Its been a trying week. My probably two hardest classes are done and over with. Now i only have to take my Chem lecture final and i'm done for this semester.  I'm kind of looking forward to next semester. I wont have my 3 science classes, so that will be a load off. But however  i do have to look at me having Chem 2 and Physics.  The chem class i'm not to worried about, its physics that has my attention.  I have no idea what to expect from that class. Other than those 2 classes i have a  Music in Society class.  I really hate how we have to take classes that have nothing to do with what we are trying to become. O well i guess i have to take it so, i'll just make the best of it. I heard that its not as bad as some people make it out to be. So i'll just have to see how it goes.

well that all i have to say for now, its time to get back to the books. Chem final in less than 18 hours so, i need to get back to studying.  Nite"

"event","well today has been yet another day like the rest of last week. Its been packed with cramming for my finals.  I think i did pritty good on the ones that i took last week now its time for the lecture finals. I'm not to worried about most of them,  only one has my real attention. I'm doing good in the classes so i dont see any way that these will really hurt me.  But doing a lot of studying will help with pulling my grades up. I know that i should get at lest a C on all of my exams. I know that for sure. So all i can do is try to get A that i know i can reach. It should be interesting to see what exactly will be on all the exams. The Chem exam will be one of the two that i will be pressed for time in.  The other is my comparative anatomy exam. But both dont have me all that worried. I've been studying like mad for them so i know that will do good.

well last nite i went to the nmu hockey game again. And once again they beat the University of Michigan, but the score was 4-1.  So with they two wins this weekend, they should move up at least 1 spot in the rankings, which will help them because they have a 1 and 1 series coming up next weekend with Michigan Tech. I would expect NMU to go at least 1 and 1 with them.  I play on going to the game at tech on saturday, that if i can get tickets for it.  They usually sell out the game every time they play.

other than that not a whole lot has been  going on here.  well its about time that i get going on some more home work or maybe i'll take a break for a lil while.  talk  to ya all later."

"event","Well last nite i went to watch the hockey game between NMU and U of M.  It was one of those games where one team was beaten in every aspect.  Michigan was bigger and stronger that NMU but the wildcats seemed to be able to stop the rush of Michigan.  NMU ended up playing a cloud zone defense to U of M couldn't rush past them and over load one side. But they speed and great passing of NMU was what won the game for them.  THe final score of the game ended up being 5-2 NMU.

but other than that not a whole lot has been going on in my life.  All i seem to be doing now is just studying for exams.  Which sucks but when its all said and done and what i get my degree, i'll be making somewhere around $100,000 starting out.  So i think the few hours i spend here arent all that bad.  So with that in mind i'm gonna go put a few more hours in before i head of to tonights hockey game.    C ya"

"event","well here it is, the end of yet another day.  Today class was cancelled for us at NMU because one of the main steam pipes broke so campus lost heat, which meant that the dorms went cold, which mean that the class rooms were freezing cold also.  So with class cancelled today i woke up at the same time but spent time from 7:30 this morning till right around noon studying for my finals that are coming up. Then i went to work because i have to take time off on wednesday to take a chem lab final that i was supposed to have today but was cancelled due to school being closed.  Some people think that it is good  to have a couple extra days to prepare for it, but i dont think so. I would have rathered taken it today just to get it out of the way, i was prepared for it today, and i was planning on having the rest of the week to prepare for a giant final in my comparative anatomy class.  That lab final is the one that i know will kill me.  The class is just that hard and i know i need to spend tons of time on it.  But now i have to make a new game plan on how i will study for the two big lab finals i have. Because i know i have to keep on the chem lab final so i dont forget it all.  But o well i guess.  This is what college is. 

And now i have other things that are going through my head.  I know something is going on, but no one will give me a strait answer.  And what one person said to me is becoming more evident when i look back on what he said.  As much as i would hate to say he is right.......i think he is.  I dont know know how i could be so damm blind.  I guess the lesson that i learned from this is not to trust anyone until they can give me a strait answer and have some way to prove it to me.  O well i guess..........

well thats all i have to say for now.......NITE"

With finals creeping up on us, i knew that i did have to get starting on studying for them.  so i figured y not start this weekend.  So that was about all that i did today.  UNTILL........

I get a phone call that starts ""  Hey Brad, can u help me......""  I should have known that i would have to do something that involved going out.  So i said yes.  It ended up being that a friend of mine was in a car accident while she was coming back from a movie with a guy. So i took off down to where they were, so i could pick the two of them up and see if she was ok.  they both are fine, a lil sore but all in all they are doing ok.  More than i can say for his car.  It looks like i ran into a cement wall.  but i guess thats y we have insurance.    but everything is all ok.

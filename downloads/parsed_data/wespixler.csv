"event","When Denise drove Abi to Rebekah's so she could take her to the airport the next morning to leave for Dallas I was able to go along. We put five pillows into the back seat for Shelby so I could ride along. I was out until after 10 PM that night which is a first for me in months; probably over a year. It took lots of drugs to do it, but what a win. It is a tribute to the new drugs the doctor has me on."

"event","I am at a critical/central/life changing place; and hot damn; what a joy, answered prayer to be at such a place and to notice it and be so clear about it all at the same time. (Truth is that I have been here for several months, and had better take a step in the ""right"" direction while I can still accomplish a lot with just a small step. The longer I dilly dally, more steps it takes to get to the same place on the road to keeping my life going in the right direction.   Dr V keeps talking about the movie, ""What about Bob"" and the lesson to take baby steps. It looks to me that a person in my position gets a lot of positive change when taking steps in the right new direction before even knowing that it is a positive step in a new direction. Where I am now, having dawdled for as long as I have, I suppose it will take more ""baby steps"", ""bigger"" more courageous steps to keep going in the right direction. So, it is time get up off the virtual couch and to get quicky with the icky"" (Japanese: to get going while the going is good.

I suppose that a lot of my newly created life will not look much different on the outside from my old life; because a part of my newly renewed undersstanding as to what is important in my life is what I have been preaching all along. But, having completely lost my faith; I now get to recreate it newly as if out of nothing. Like the new convert; the renewed convert gets to be an even deeper true believer. Like, the old ""man of Faith"" notice that the new ""man of faith"" is already so very good at judging and condemning myself.

So, here is today's renewed discovery: for me, my life has to have a significant relationship with the church. It is not enough to just be an occasional pew warmer. It is time for me to start giving back to and through the church; perhaps at least a baby step or two."

"event","Well, its been about a month now since I had my botox injections. Lately, I have notice several things that I am crediting these injections with. I am not needing emergency ""M & M"" (meditation and medication) with my EMDR machine very much at all lately. I am screaming a lot less (crying like a baby, as Kaezen calls it). This is a big one. I have often screamed and cried out in pain in the past. My other meds seem to do what they are supposed to do more often. Before I would take everything and still not get a hold on all the pain. I am taking a lot less hot baths for the pain. I have more endurance; I still spend most of the day in bed, but I still have some energy at the end of the day so I can go out for ice cream (for example) if I want to.

I am not yet ready to ask for less meds. I am not yet ready to wear my legs much at all. These are at least a couple of goals I have not yet reached. Perhaps I will think to check in again in another month."

"event","""Dignity."" That was the subject of today's reading from the book, ""Peace in the Storm."" This is a book of devotions by and for those of us living with chronic, serious illness. As soon as I started to read, I had a flash back to the day Russell and I went for my most recent blood test. I immediately realised that, in situations like this--waiting in a medical office, I use humor to  deal with the wait and uncertanty. I shift into ""Wes, the clown"" mode and am constantly looking for the next bad joke or pun. My radar is so focused on this that I cannot ""be here now"" with the uncomfortable situation. Shrink type people (and specifiecally Dr Oddy) have often picked up on this immediately and I have denied it, failed to see it, made another joke of it. Well, the joke, Dr Oddy, is that you were right all along. 

PS
It doesn't take a ""shrink type person"" to notice this; only someone who is breathing. Everyone has noticed this but me. At least to the degree that I ""got it"" this morning.

Thank you, Lord, for the new depth of insight into my soul. I probably won't stop this automatic behavior, but maybe next time I will notice it more.

Hhm, ""automatic behavior."" That means I should put this new insight into the formulas of the cognitive behavior stuff and see what more, deeper insight I can dig up. An assignment for later. Now I have to get ready for lunch with a friend. (See, I did learn from the nightmare the other day. After writing about that the other day, I realized that that is a recurring nightmare that I have about myself and that the reality is not as bad as the nightmare. I do have friends, and called one up and invited him out to lunch right after writing about that nightmare here.)."

"event","first, last night's insight

Over the years, I have learned to listen to my dreams. They are one of the clearest ways my subconsciouness talks to my conscious self. So, this morning I woke up at a difficult time for me--9:30 AM. That is too early for me to be in good shape later in the day (I hope I get a nap and that helps). However, it is sometimes too late to go back to sleep for another couple of hours, especially if my mind is going strong, and boy is it today. The nightmare that woke me was a haunting one. I guess that means the subconscious was trying to hammer today's lesson home; and it got the conscious mind going strong in response to it. Thus I am writing this instead of going back to sleep.

The dream was about the ""good old GSLP days"" (Guest Seminar Leaders' Program for the est Training). In the dream I was trying to ""close the sale"" trying to get someone to sign up for the training. In the dream (unlike how we were trained to do it in GSLP), the ""guest"" kept saying ""no"" and all of us were gathered around ""handling his/her considerations."" You know; for everything this person said we had another reason why that meant they were perfectly in the right place to sign on the bottom line. Sometimes I was the assistant trying to signing up the guest and sometimes I was the guest. It didn't matter. I was being hounded and pressured just as much in the dream.

When I woke up and asked myself what that dream meant, I realized that I had never made any lasting friendships with anyone at Landmark all those years. In California we lived a distance away from both centers where we assisted. Shucks, Michele and I practically helped build the center in Orange County. So, we would drive nearly an hour, do our job, maybe go out to eat with some of the team and then go home. We were too far away to just hang out with anyone. The only thing that changed when we moved to Golorado was that we were even farther away and participated less. 

Abi and Genea often talk about people they know from Landmark who are friends that they hang out with in other settings and so who are real friends; not just people with whom they assist. I never had anyone like that at Landmark. I now see that perhaps this was one of the things they were trying to help us create in seminars when we had teams; but that was usually about how many guest we could bring. I think that it probably wasn't much different all those years in the church. We still have a few friends from Ogden, that we obviously don't hang out with too often. We have a handful of friends from Estes Park, but even that seems to be too great a distance for some friends. Denise will still go out to lunch or even dinner in Estes when she is up there for work. But the only time I see anyone is when they are down here in Ft Collins shopping and they have time to stop; which doesn't seem to be any more often that we might see someone from a former church from out of state. Lee has been good about stopping in to see me, but he is about the only one who even calls just to see how I am doing. With any other friends I see them when they call and set something up, which is about as often as when someone from out of state calls to set something up when they are passing through town.

So the lesson from today's nightmare, little grasshopper, is this: I don't have many friends. I mostly have acquaintences from work or some other way in which I was using people to meet some other purpose in my life other than friendship. In fact, it may not be going too far to say that Wes Pixler doesn't know how to make friends because he doesn't know how to be a friend! To wake up realizing that is enough to qualify as a nightmare, I think."

"event","Well, we did it! It must have been about 12:15 pm by the time the doctors got it done. Yes, we had a real para-docs going today. Both Dr Sisson and Dr Yeager participated. Each one injected one leg. I fealt better immediately and walked out of the office at about 1.0, or even less, on that infamous 1-10 pain perception scale.


We went out for lunch and I stayed at that low level of pain through the end of lunch. Then I went and stood in the bathroom for about 10 minutes. That was enough to hurt quite a bit. Now it is about 4:30 PM and I have had one Actiq lollipop and still hurt a bit. Much of the pain is different from the usual pain. A lot of it seems to do with having a needle stuck into the end of my stumps several times. I suppose this pain will go away in the next couple of days; and that also by that time, I will have a better idea what it is going to be like on a permanent place. It seems that if I think I need  more I can get another shot later on.

I believe this certainly is an answered prayer."

"event","But first a little by of catching up. I recently realized that I tend to ""let go"" and crash when there is a new hope on the horizon. So this is what I have done for the past month or so. I have been too at the end of my rope to even journal about it.

Yesterday was the worst. I had flu-like symptoms all day long. I was so bad that I forgot all about my usual aches and pains. Denise had to spoon feed me apple sauce and chicken noodle soup I couldn't even lift my own spoon. I did manage to make it to the bathroom in time for vicious diarreah all except once. Of course I slept all day so I was awake half the night.

Now for the good news. First, I think I will live. Next, Dr Sisson's office called and I am scheduled for botox injections in my stumps on Friday. This is the long awaited new hope for which I crashed the past month as my psychological mechanism to prepare to be disappointed. Still, this procedure is supposed to relieve a lot of pain and the doctor said the results could be permanent."

"event","Howrah! The Doctor Vaughn increased my oxycontin dosage yesterday. Yesterday was a tough day because I wore my legs to the doctor and to lunch. But today, while I did not wear my legs, I did go out of the house long enough to have lunch. I expected today to be hard all the way through the day because of how bad the legs hurt first thing in the morning. I sort of had a nap this afternoon after getting back from lunch (closed my eyes off and on for over an hour while trying to read). The good news is this. Only two Actiq lollipops today. If that is not miraculous it is at least a very positive, and welcome, result of the Oxy kicking in! Praise the Lord. Hallelujah, and pass the meds. Amen.

Sorry I could not make the Support group summer picnic. With the heat of today and the extra exertion of wearing the legs yesterday, there was just no way I could have made it."

"event","Today I met with Dr Yeager for my monthly drug fill-up. This also the time I have been waiting for for the past two weeks to hear what he and Dr Sisson have decided to do for me after his test run of the anteseptic on the neuromas at the ends of my nerves. First, he was very considerat and understanding of my drug needs for pain managment in the short term. For example, I wanted to increase my dosage of oxycontin. He said,""Well, if that is what you need that is what we will give you.""

For the long term he wants to inject botox at the end of my nerve neuromas. I don't know exactly how or why this will work, but I asked how long this would last as pain relief. He said, ""it could be permanent relief!"" Now, I have heard that before; more than once. But to put it in Dr Sisson's baseball metaphors, I don't need or expect a home run (since I have never had one). However, I when we did the neurostimulator; we didn't get a home run, but a base hit was helpful. If botox could get me to second or thir base I would sure be happy.

Of course I would be thrilled with a home run!

It seems like the next logical step to follow up on the class on  cognitive behaviroal therapythat I have gone through twice with a group, and once on my own reading the book at the same pace with another group. If we learned about the link between mind and body and physical pain, then this seems like a book on another way to work at pain management from the point of view of using mental process.

Today was the first assignment on paying attention to my breathing. I was supposed to do that for 15 minutes. It was hard. my mind wanderedevery which way. At one poin I told myself that I was just supposed to pay attention to my breathing and so I could get up and put my ice away while paying attention to my breathing. Then I remembered that the assignment was to ""get into a comfortable position and notice my breathing."" Wandering was not part of the assignment. Whenever I closed my eyes I began to day dream. I went all over the place. Finally I had to open my eyes and notice my breathing. That was the only way to keep the day dreaming down to a manageable amount.

But that is not what I want to write about. It is just an interesting aside.

When Ben called I started remembering how my life of pain when he was here. There was the one night when his kids were here and I ""cried like a baby"" to put it into Kaezen's terms. Of course the day I went to the hospital twice. Ben drove me to see dad at the rehab hospital in Loveland; and that was way overdoing it. I remember the heat being bad on the pain.

Mostly this was a follow up to my day of ambulence trips to the ER. Of course that was 3 weeks ago so there wasn't anything left over from that specific day. However, we did find something worth changing my medications over. When she listened to my lungs she said that they sounded very good. No wheezing or whining. When she did a breathing test to check my volume and flow of air there was enough concern on her part to put me on a new inhaler. This one I am to take twice a day, every day. Well, we will see how this goes. My breathing is alwas pretty good, but maybe I will notice a difference. Shucks, maybe I will even have more energy. Who knows?

I wore my legs today and weighed 223 fully clothed and everything. That is the lowest I have weighed in a long time, and it also means that I have kept the weight off that I started losing around November of 2005 when I weighed 244 (the most I have ever weighed)! Yeah, some good medical news."

Today its Thursday and I have to say that I have only needed two Actiq lollipops each day on Tues and Wed. Of course I am back on the Oxycontin, and had a little extra both days, but I also had my legs on for a while each of these days. Besides, I'll take days with fewer lollipops any way I can get them.

We all decided it was worth a try, so we did it immediately. They both poked my stumps untill they found one especially tender spot. Then Dr V injected an anesthesia in then tender spot at the end of each leg. 

As a result I left the doctor's office with a pain of 0 on that infamous scale of 1-10!! It stayed that way for a good hour. Then it started coming back; slowly but steadily.

The exciting thing is a new hope. I am such a sucker for hope. there is nothing anyone can do for my pain and then all of a sudden someone has a new idea and dangles it in front of me like the proverbial carrot. 

Dr Sisson has a new partner, whom I saw on Friday. I didn't like him because he made a bad first impression. Everything I told him we had done to treat me he said was the wrong thing. He would have done something else. I hate people who come in late in the game and try to second guess those who have been treating me for years. I have always had the very best medical care I could have. I think everything we have done so far was exactly the right thing to do at the time. 

The only thing I like about Dr Vaughn is that he has a new treatment to try. It is something I have heard about before. The way I have heard it the Russians have pioneered this idea and are having some good results with it.

If I have a neuroma at the end of my nerves (and not just neuropathic pain) then he can inject a long lasting anesthesia(?, I'm not sure what he said here) it will lower my pain considerably. If, this works then the neuroma idea is confirmed as a major cause of my pain. If that is true, then he could go in and clip off the ends of the nerves a little higher up to get rid of the neuromas. Then he would tuck the ends of my nerves back into muscle fat (? again I am not sure of the exact thing here). This would prevent the nerve from creating another neuroma. If this all works, it could lessen my pain greatly.

I pray that this works."

"event","Well, I said it was just a hope; but, as often, it was too hopeful. I woke up at about 10:45 yesterday. Too late for 11 AM worship, but in good time to go out to lunch afterward. That was plenty. When Denise said she needed to stop back home briefly before going to the hospital to see dad I knew that I was already at my limit and should just stay home afer going out for lunch. But since when have I done the reasonable thing. Though I had no idea what I was getting myself in for.

Hugh and Deborah were already at the hospital when we got there. Pat called from the car and was on the way to the hospital along with mom and Buffy and would be there soon. So we waited for them to come. It was a great idea to bring Buffy. At home she misses dad and looks for him all the time. She has no idea where he is or why he doesn't come home. Now, even a dog can get that he is at the other end of a car ride and that he is staying in the bed in the neck brace. I imagine that a dog can imagine a place once she has seen it, and can imagine her master being there. I'm also certain that she is comforted by that knowledge.

The hospital said that we could bring the dog into the front lobby to see dad. So we all went out there to wait. Unfortunately, Pat got lost getting there. All of us, including dad, joked about how many times she would call back for directions. It was over an hour before she finally got there. By then, dad had to go back to bed to rest and I wanted to do the same. Denise finally went back into Loveland to show Pat the way to the hospital. By the time she did get to the hospital I was ready to scream (not just at Pat for being so dumb, but to scream in pain) at the top of my lungs. 

Denise got me home just about 5 PM. I'm not going to brag about being out that long since I was really ready to quit at 1:30 PM. So my new hope is that I will be totally recovered from this weekend by tomorrow when I go see Dr Springfield for my next treatment. Also, I think I may need to continue going once a week instead of once every two weeks like we tried this time."

At first I  didn't think that the last electro-accupunture treatment did any good. For several days I didn't see any difference.

On Friday my dad fell off a ladder and broke his neck and back and several ribs. What a whirlwind of activity we have gone through this past week. Denise went down to Longmont the first night to spend with mom. We have had someone with her every night since. Including, I took 2 nights myself. 

Mom keeps her house warmer than we keep ours. Heat has always been a stresser and therefore a cause of pain. My brain goes crazy whenever I  have to keep track  of more than 3 things at a time. By the time Russell came to pick me up on the last morning to come home I was in a world of hurt even before I got my breakfast at the hospital cafeteria. We got into see dad just as he was moving from his first room to the second one. We stayed a short time and then came home. After 2 days I felt recovered. Without the treatment earlier that week it would  have taken twice that long. Since I have been home I have been trying to catch up. One day I wore myself out doing bills on the computer. But I was recovered by the next day.

Today I spent over an hour waiting the the doctor's office (it was too hot) and then to a movie. That is a busy day for me, but I hope to be up to full speed tomorrow so I can see dad at the new hospital in Loveland tomorrow."

"event","It has been a while since I have written anything and this is a sign of the fact that I have felt so much better that I didn't want to take time to write. I have been busy reading and doing other things.

Friday was a hard day. I drove for the first time in over a month! I went to two different appointments, walked more than 500 steps, and didn't get down in bed until after 2 PM! Now, that is something. I haven't done that much in probably six months. ""But wait! If you call our 800 number on your screen in the next ten minutes you will also get.."" That is kind of how it sounds as I write it because there is more. After all of that of course I was totally wiped out the rest of Friday and I did everything I know to take care of myself. Normally I would have taken 3+ days to recuperate from something like that. Saturday I did nothing, and I only needed one Actiq all day! Sunday was another busy day and I felt pretty good by the end of the day.

See, I write a lot to complain; but when things are going well I write so little. The record of my trials and tribulations is therefore an unbalanced account.

Yesterday I had another electric acupuncture treatment. We discussed the previous two treatements and decided that the longer (3 inch) needles in the buttocks does seem to make a difference as compared to the one inch needles. This time, however, I don't feel anything yet.

On another front that needs mentioning, the Heart of the Rockies (the church we attend) has started a healing service over the noon hour for those who cannot make it to the evening one. This is a once a month service and it was today. I went and enjoyed it. There were only five of us but it was a nice service. I have  to sign off now because the pain is killing me (about an 8 out of 10 for those who need numbers."

Nothing had seemed to work from either of the first two sessions and yesterday, for the first time, Dr Springfield started talking like it might not work. Remember, he had been so positive the first two times. So, yesterday he tried a different approach which included sticking three inch long needles in the outside of each butt, right through my pants! This let the electricity go in through a different path. He is hoping for some clear sign of this process working like less meds for the first 3-4 days after the treatment. Well, yesterday I had only one Actiq lollipop all day long! It must have been at least six months since I have been able to do that! Right now it is 1:00 pm and no lollipops yet today, which does happen; but only occasionally. It also makes it 24 hours since my last lollipop! So, it is clear to me that something worked!"

We went out to lunch and then I was feeling so good that I ask Denise if we could go for a ride! We went way north of town looking for Ralyn's new house. It is just 15 miles south of the Wyoming border. It took us a while to find it. Her directions said to take the second right turn, and one of them went by too fast so we had to come back to it. Then they said to turn at the blue barn that advertized horses for sale. It was a red barn. We finally found it, but no one was home so I just talked to one of the horses (she owns three). The purpose of our travels was not to visit anyway. I didn't have my legs on. I had not expected to do anything more than go to the restaurant and come home. It was just to go for a ride and enjoy the glorious day. I did have to use the rest room while we were at the restaurant. Denise wondered if I could do it, but I did a transfer from the wheel chair to the potty and back just fine. I don't know what I would have done had the bathroom not been set up well, but it was.

I had only one Actiq while we were out and about, at around 3 PM. I was out of the house until about 4:30 PM! That is really late for me. What a grand day it was."

"event","Dear Diary,

Yesterday was a terrible day. Russell drove me to my pain class in the morning. I had my first lollipop at about 11 AM. There were only 3 of us in class so we all worked hard and learned much, though I'm not sure you would have known that if you watched a video of the class.

Then we went to lunch at the ""Bent Fork"" restaurant at the new mall in Loveland. It is right next to Kay Jewelers so I picked up Denise's 15th wedding anniversary present (the necklace that goes with the ear rings I got her for Christmas).

Then we barely made it to Greeley for my 1:45 with Jason. Unfortunately for me he was delayed and would not be back until 2:30. By this time I was totally wasted and could not wait around for an extra 45 minutes. There was a time when I complained that I could only do 4 stores/events in one day. Now two is too many! We rescheduled my appointment for Monday. When we got home I went straight to bed and took a nap. Last night I slept for 13 hours plus. I was that wasted. I never thought I would look forward to a day alone at home with just me, the cat, and the dog; but I canceled my appointment with my spiritual director for today so that I could stay home and rest up!

Today has not been too bad; no worse than the day after an ordinary day of overdoing it just a moderate amount. I'm sure that is because of all the  sleep I got. I hope to be in good shape for the weekend tomorrow. Denise  promises to wear me out.  I said, ""I sure hope so."" I always look forward to being out with Denise. Not only do I get out of the house, but I get to spend time with Denise; and that is always wonderful."

I drove home as fast as possible, with an Actiq lollipop in my mouth. I hoped that I would be safe to drive before it kicked in too much. I did start feeling pain relief even before getting home, but think I was safe all the way. I got home and did my emergency meditation and that calmed me down enough to be OK.

"event","Much has happened since I last wrote. I kept telling myself that it was more important to live my life than to write about it; of course forgetting that journaling is a part of my therapy for my pain. So here I am back again. Last Tuesday I met with Dr Springfield (he doesn't seem to like to go by Mike) who is a chiropractor writing a book about how well his electric acupuncture works. I told him that I would be happy to be ""chapter 11: a testimonial of someone for whom nothing else worked but for whom this therapy work miracles."" He, of course, thinks that my case is a perfect one for his therapy and that (in a few months) I will notice a world of difference. I sure hope that he is right. I need something to work wonders because I have become discouraged again.

Thursday I met with a salesperson who gave me a portable tens unit. It felt great in the office and he is checking to see if he can get me a second unit; one for each leg. It feels a lot like the neurostimulator, but works differently in that the electrical signal it sends through my legs comes from the outside instead of the inside. It will not work miracles, but will be one more weapon to use on a regular basis in my battle against pain.

Sunday night I got so discouraged that I had another discussion about the ""ultimate solution"" to my pain--if I no longer have a body I can no longer experience pain. When I put it that clearly and simply it sounds about as good as ""if I get rid of my legs I will get rid of my pain."" We all know how well that one worked. Of course this assumes a soul that survives the death of the body--not a proven theory (and not one that anyone can know ahead of time); but a theory upon which I had staked my life, theology, and work. Then the questions are several. Do we have a God of retribution who punished suicides? Or, even if we have a merciful God who can understand and forgive such drastic actions, is there some kind of ""natural consequences"" in the afterlife which causes one's eternal soul to suffer, just as the body can suffer such horrendous pain as a result of natural physical laws even though we have a merciful God who does not cause such pain as a punishment for our sins in this life?

It is pretty easy to suppose that the eternal love of two soul mates can survive beyond the grave; but can they survive the ""sin"" of suicide? If I kill myself, is it still allowed for my immortal angel to stay with, and watch over Denise? All kinds of, perhaps wierd, thoughts come to mind. I'm willing to bet it all on an all merciful God who can forgive anything. After all, several friends and family members have said that, while they certainly don't want me to do it, they could understand if I chose this way out. After all they have seen how much I suffer, and how relentless it is. Surely the God of Love that we preach is even more understanding than our friends and family! But that hasn't spared me so much suffering and pain in this life just as a natural consequence of things, not as a punishment of God. How am I to suppose that choosing to end my mortal life will solve all the problems of my immortal existence. That seems too simplistic to be true, based on what I know of eternity from having lived this life so far. 

On the other hand, how can I go on much longer? How much can one person take? 1 Corinthians 10:13 says, ""No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it."" Earlier, this passages warns against complaining too much to God. Even so, my own testimony of faith at this time in my life has to be that God has not lived up to His end of the bargain. I have been given more than I can bear on my own strength; and I have not received enough divine grace to bear when leaning on God for the strength that I do not have. To paraphrase the Psalmist, ""How long, O God. Will you leave in this despair without your aid, comfort, help, grace and strength forever?""

That is the cry of my heart. Hear the despair of my soul O God, and grant me relief. Grant me the strength to bear the cross that has been given to me, so that in total despair I do not end my own life because I can see no other way out. Amen."

"event","I did something today I have thought about doing for a long time. I just bit off one piece of it and did that today. I didn't try to do the whole huge project. I have often thought of starting a web page where people could write and respond to different Scriptures that, through out the ages have been helpful for people in times of trouble in their lives. 

Somewhere in my ministerial kit of computer tools I have a list of such  passages so I can pull them out when they are needed. I suppose most of these are ""funeral scriptures"" since that is where I have so often needed and used this tool. But, too often, people pull these scriptures out too fast and too easily to help someone else. An ""easy"" scripture passage often comes out in place of truly listening to someone else and truly being there for them. That is the danger of such a list. It becomes used as spiritual, or scriptural abuse!

Yet, these passages have in deed been helpful to countless numbers of people throughout the centuries. So, the idea, is to put them out there on a web page for people to wrestle with these passages until the get the ""gold"" that  is in there somewhere if you just keep setting with these holy words of wisdom until you do find the comfort of the Holy Spirit for yourself speaking to you anew through these words.

In fact, I am reading a book by Maureen Pratt that is a series of devotions for those of us in chronic pain that does just this. Each chapter starts with one of those scriptures that is supposed to be of comfort and help to us. Then she writes her witness to the truth of God that she has gotten from the text of the day. (The book is, ""Peace in the Storm: Meditations on Chronic Pain and Illness). 

The book is good and I would recommend it to anyone. However, the shortfall is that in this book all we have is the witness of Maureen Pratt. The Holy Spirit may very well speak a different truth to someone else out of the same passage. Even Maureen might write something different at a different time of her life. So my thought is to put the scriptures out there on the net and let others wrestle and respond to those Scriptures that are supposed to bring us comfort and hope. Then we could all learn from one another.

So, like I say, I didn't do the whole kit and caboodle today. I created a database to contain this material; and I wrote my first ""devotion"" to see how it went. Sort of kicked the tires and took it for a spin around the block. I did find the exercise helpful for me. Whether I ever go any farther than this or not; today I started. (And wore myself out in the process as usual)."

How long must one man keep up the fight against pain.."" and a few other choice phrases. Then, yesterday we went to the movie. It took me two Actiq lollipops to get through the movie. That is about normal, but then normally I need #3 at about 7 pm and often would like to have another about 9 PM. Well, it is 1 PM on Monday and I still haven't had #3 from yesterday! Nor, would it be unusual to need at least one by this time for today.  Denise also said she could tell in my demenor yesterday that I was feeling better.

"event","Russell drove me to the doctor's office today. I had hoped to do it on my one. It was just a drug refill visit. Those visits are scheduled to last 5 minutes and Friday is the day that the assistant who used to do that had those visits all day She got a better offer by someone else and stopped working there recently so the Doctor himself was doing those visits today. That was fine with me because I wanted to talk to him about upping some of my meds. It should have been a quick easy in and out visit. Unfortunately the doctor was running late. We were on time for my 11:30 visit. There were only two people ahead of us in the waiting room. Still, it was 12:40 before he came to our room to see me. That meant it was 1 PM before we left. Russell had to be at work by 2 pm and was getting flustered because he wanted to run a couple of errands before work.

So I was telling Russell that one of the officially recommended tricks of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is to keep a journal. You can see how well I do. I certainly don't write every day, but today I have plenty of frustration to get out of my system. I told Russell that I figured that one of the purposes of journaling is to let out my frustrations through the keyboard so that I don't let them out on friends and family who come my way when I am feeling this way. Dump it on the blog, not face to face on your family. It is good advice. It works. However, another frustration this official medical advice brings to mind is that if this is the best medical advice they have to give it is kind of admitting that they don't know what to do for the pain. It seems like it is their way of saying, ""We, in the medical profession, don't know what to do about your pain, so here is some good friendly advice. Dump your frustration out in your blog, not on us.""

See, it did work. I thought I had a lot more to say, but by now I am calmed down a lot and can't remember what all else it is that I had to say. I guess it is time to settle in with my novel and see what is happening there."

Give me strength to wait out the pain until it goes away.
Be with me in the midst of my pain.
It is so much easier to know the glory of God when the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the children are laughing out of joy. Everything is right with the world and God is great. God is good.

When the storms of life are raging, stand by me O God. Stand by and hold on to me when I don't have a leg to stand on because my legs hurt so much that I took them off and put them in their corner.
The people who proclaim ""no pain--no gain"" know the rewards for their efforts; but when pain is the cross one must bear there is no reward. It is hard to remember that you also bore a cross; and that you still call out the those who find themselves on the cross to your left or right.

When you said, ""Take up your cross and follow me"" I knew it would be hard. I knew it would be the road less travelled. But I thought it would be a ""purpose driven life"" where I could rest in the comfort of your presence. I expected that hope would light the way even in the darkness of evil and persecution. I expected the burdens of traveling this way of the cross would be made easier by the love of fellow travelers.

But, Lord, this cross makes no sense. There is no glory in a life of chronic, never-ending pain. How can I be a witness to the Good News, when my own life has been stripped of happiness and hope. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. So much of this journey you have called me to travel is a journey I must travel alone. How can I expect any one else to understand the pain or the depression. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine a life so terrible as the one you have called me to live.

Yet, even here you are with me. You promised to be here. You carried your own cross before you asked your followers to carry ours. Not even those who are closest to me can know the full weight of my cross; but the walk next to me. They cannot carry my cross, but they are there with a cup of water to quench my thirst. When I cannot walk another step, they sit with me. They listen to my cries of despair. They wipe away the tears on my face. 

And if others who are carrying their own crosses take time to walk a while with me and to share in my grief and sorrow; then how much more can I count on the love and support of my Christ. 

O Jesus Christ hear my cries of despair and desolation. I look to you as an example of one whose cross was so much worse than my own. But I  need more than an example and an inspiration. I need your strength, for I am so weak. I need your endurance; my own ran out so long ago. I need your love; it is so hard to love my own life when it is such a difficult one. I need your grace, for I stumble and fall so often.

Praise be to the God of grace who shares our daily lives; and  who can be known not only in the glories of happiness and joy, but who comes to us when we are so weak and so far from perfection. Praise be to the God who hears our cries of pain and agony as prayers of the faithful. For our tears and our cries of desparation are also prayers as much as our shouts of praise and hosanna.

Thank you, O God, for hearing my prayers. Amen."

"event","In Memory
of My Right Foot

It was five years ago yesterday (2/27/2001) that I had my first foot and ankle amputated. I had what I thought was a minor birth defect in my ankles which led to surgery in 8th grade, which led to arthritis at the age of 30, which got so bad that I had both legs amputated to get rid of the pain. The left leg was just over 4 years ago. 

When trying to explain my situation to  me a couple of years back my doctor said, ""When someone has been in chronic pain as long as you have I have never personally experienced, nor have I ever heard of someone who did not have 'pain issues' for the rest of their lives."" Nerves are wonderful things. When cut, they grow back. It took a couple of years after my amputations, but the nerves found, or made, new paths by which they could send pain signals to my brain. Once the pathes were found, my body built a freeway so that the pain signals could get priority A1 and send lots of pain signals to my brain.

I cut off my legs to get rid of the pain; and all I got rid of was my legs. The pain now is worse than it was before the amputations. Of course that was 5 years ago and the bones were rubbing on bones and deteriorating at an ever increasing rate. If I had not had my legs amputated I probably would not be able to walk, would certainly have done more serious damage to the feet and ankles and the pain would  have been 24/7. With proper treatment, drugs and rest; I do have respite from the pain some of the time. The most recent and successful treatment is to get nerve blocks about once a month. I just had one last Thursday. Since then I have been taking less vicodine and the pain has been less intense most of the time. I went to church on Sunday for the first time since Christmas (I think). Church was too much and I was back in pretty bad pain on Sunday and Monday from that. Again, today I did too much and am suffering from too many errands today.

This is supposed to be a memorial to my foot, and general reflections on the past 5 years. Sometime in the past month I had a very clear and vivid memory of how it was when I still had my feet I cried and wept at the memories. The foot pain was different from the current neuropathic pain. I am so glad we got rid of my feet! That pain was oppressive, and never ending. After preaching two services on Sunday mornings it was often Thursday before I was comfortable walking again. In those days I still thought I could go shopping at the mall without a wheelchair. If I did that on Saturday, I started out in pain on Sunday."

"event","Today was the big day. I had to be at the Loveland Surgery Center at 9:15 AM to check in for a 10:15 nerve block. Denise and I were home by about noon, I think; even after stopping at Sonic for breakfast/lunch. 

But first, let me talk about yesterday. Painwise, it was outstanding (pun intended, always). Shelby and I drove all the way out to the new mall in Loveland, still the fartherest I have driven by myself since at least Thanksgiving. We went to make another payment on Denise's 15th anniversary present. Of course, just as I parked the car there I realized that I could be making monthly electronic payments and no driving, walking, standing or waiting involved. Of all the things I miss I miss my mind the most. So, I did a lot, and I still only needed 2 Actiq all day long. It has been 10 days-2 weeks I have gotten through a day with only 2 Actiq, including I am afraid, today.

Not really much to say about today. I had to get up early, which is always hard. After we got home I laid in bed and read all afternoon. I still needed 2 Actiq this afternoon. I waited until desparate both times and getting that way again."

Denise and I went shopping this afternoon. We each saw a puppy we liked and the Bichon-Cocker Spaniel almost came home with us. It now occurs to me that this would have been a good situation in which to take a photo with my camera phone and e-mail that plus a phoned in bit of info to my journal. If we had gotten a pup we should certainly have had quality photos from one of the better cameras posted on the family website by the end of the day for sure.

Pain update. I woke up at just after 11 AM but Denise came into the bedroom just about then and we started visiting and we didn't get up and ready to go for the day until after 1 PM. I had to have my first lollipop before we left the house but it lasted until about 4:30 PM! That was great endurance. I had the second while we were looking at the puppies and finished it about the time we got home. It is now quarter past five and I am icing my stumps but otherwise OK. That putps me on"

"event","""A Sacred Sorrow"" is the title of one of the new devotional books I am reading.

I have studied and taught about lament psalms. They are so much more than someone who is dissatisfied and is just whining and complaining. Most of the psalms are lament psalms. To lament is to carry on a sacred conversation and relationship with God. It is just a different way of communicating and relating with God and is no less valid that psalms of praise.

So I get it. I have been doing way too much whining and complaining; not unlike a spoiled little brat. [OK, Wes, we are trying to get away from beating ourself up, even while being honest.] I am at a place of mourning and lamenting. Instead of just complaining, it is time to get down to the hard work of honest lamenting. Instead of complaining to others about God, it is time to start talking directly to God. It is fine to lament and complain as long as this is a part of the real work of working on my relationship with God. It is time to remember the depth of the bumper sticker theology that says... (I think I will leave that thought incomplete as a way of reminding myself that I had a ""brilliant"" insight but lost it in the time it took me to type the sentence. That is how it is in my life a lot right now.)

So I think I will try to wright a lament psalm here. That feels like the right thing to do. I will add it here if and when I am finished with it."

"event","Dear Diary,

I had two fairly common patterns happen today that I want to tell you about. The first was at the movie. I took my first Actiq just as it was starting at about 1:30 PM. I needed the second one almost immediately afterward, but let's say 2:30 PM just to be generous. The second one right on top of the first one then lasted quite a while. When the movie was over I still felt pretty good and made it until the middle of dinner, say about 5:30 PM. Just to be out of the house at that time is pretty good. When we got home I didn't want to take the last Actiq of the day right away, so I had a hot bath. It is now 6:47 PM (exactly) and I still feel pretty good. If I can take the last Actiq at 7 PM or later it usually lasts me until my 9 PM pills, when I take the rest of my pills for the end of the day. Then I can make it until after Jay Leno's monologue is over (about 11 PM) when I go to sleep and hopefully don't need any more pills for the rest of the night.

Well, I know that I had 2 insights, but I can't think of the other one; so the ""buddy system"" of 2 Actiqs in 2 hours lasting for a total of 5-6 hours will have to do for today."

"event","Throughout the Book of Job his friends and advisers tell him he should just give up, curse God and die. Throughout the book, Job asks God a lot of questions like ""why me"" but his faith in God never wavers. He never curses God. He said he didn't complain when God gave him so many blessings and he will not curse God for the tough times of life either. Well, I tried to be faithful like Job. After all I am a minister. I have to set an example. Even when my faith is tested, it is supposed to remain faithful. Questions make faith stronger, but one is never supposed to give up on ones faith and curse God.

I am not as strong as Job. I have been to the place of faithlessness, lost faith, and, yes, I have even cursed God and asked to die. I am glad we also preach a God who forgives, because I need divine forgiveness.

In the Hebrew Scriptures tough times test our faith like Job. In the Christian Scriptures we have the promise that ""God will never give us more than we can handle."" somewhere in Corinthians I think. So the test of faith has become a promise of faith. That is the Good News of the Gospel. When someone who has never had their faith tested by trying times quotes this scripture to someone going through tough times, it is meant to be a consoling promise to help that person through the tough times. It often is, but when it comes out too easily and too often it stops being helpful and starts becoming ""scriptural abuse"" (also known as ""spiritual abuse""). It is too easy when it does not come from hard won experience. On the lips of someone who has suffered and who has found consolation and solace from this scriptural promise it can be a tremendous testimony of faith. The testimony is now something like, ""life tested my faith but I found God's presence in new ways and now my faith is stronger than ever. I know that if God has been with me in such difficult times in the past, God will never leave me no matter what life brings my way in the future.

So here is my testimony. If I failed God by not being as strong as Job; God failed me by not living up to the promise to never give me more than I could handle (I have always preached this as ""while life may often throw things my way that I cannot handle on my own, it will never give me anything that is more than God and I together cannot handle). Well, God failed me also. I have cried out to God often in these recent years and asked for divine help; but this last year, on top of all the years before it, has often been more than I could take even with the help God has given and the help God has withheld. 

So,  God, we are even. I have failed you. You have failed me. But we always knew that I was but weak mortal flesh. You are supposed to be never failing. ""My God, My God. Why have you forsaken me?"" Yes, I guess you have been to this place of ultimate desolation and betrayal. You have gone ahead of me to prepare a place for me, so that even here you are with me. Help me O God, to know your presence even here. Help  me to know that this is not just another failed promise. Forgive me for my weakness and for my failure.

I remain forever your humble and faithful servant,

Wes"

"event","I had hoped to take an extra oxycontine or two before leaving for the theater but forgot. I did take 2 vicodine when we first got there. The pain had already started. Part of the pain came from the fact that Denise had to wake me out of a sound sleep at 11 AM in order to get ready to go. I'm not sure I recovered from that until after a short afternoon nap after getting home. At the intermission she asked me if I wanted to leave and I said, ""no, why?"" Apparently my color was all purple, which is usually a sign to anyone who knows me that I am in bad pain. I did start my second lollipop (Actiq)just as the intermission started so I did not feel the pain so much. And, I was glad to get home when we did.

In fact Denise questions whether we will be able to continue going to the dinner theater next year because of my pain. After reading last  night's post you will see that this idea does not come out of the blue. In fact, I think that, with the meds, it wasn't much worse then going to lunch and a movie.

There are 5 shows next season instead of 4 so I would really be upset if we had to quit going. We thought about it and decided we have been season ticket holders since Christmas of our first year in this house. It occurs to me that an e-mail to the owner night come up with an alternative plan to quiting being season ticket holders altogether. I don't know what he can do, but it never hurts to ask. The first year we learned that I could not go to any evening shows any more and we have been faithful Sunday matinee people ever since."

"event","It is Saturday night Feb 11 and Denise and I are scheduled to go to the dinner theater tomorrow for our Valentine's day date. Just thinking about it and remembering how much it hurt by the end of the show last time is filling my mind with worry and frightful foreshadowing of how it is likely to be. I am hoping that by looking at it and confessing/owning the fear/stress it will ease it more now and/or tomorrow. After all, isn't that the whole idea of the cognitive behavioral training?"

I can call in and make an audio entry in my journal from my cell phone just like leaving a phone message on someone's answering machine. Now when something really special or exciting happens I can make a journal entry this the feelings are fresh!"

"event","And a great big howdy-do and welcome from all our readers (me) goes out to Carrie Adamson, my doctor and (I hope) my friend.

Now that I got that bit of silliness out of the way (I just can't help myself) I do want to welcome you, Carrie. I sent out several invites yesterday and you are the first to respond, though I do hope there will be others. I also understand that one way of journalling is to just write a stream of consciousness type whatever is on one's mind. You will also be glad to know that I understand that there are other ways of writing in one's journal.

By this time yesterday (5 PM) when I wanted to write in my journal I was just too worn out. Since one of my issues that I am working on for pain management is to try to stop being so much of a type A driven person. I have all kinds of  lists and tasks to do in order to be less of a type A! Anyway, yesterday when I had the energy to push through and write; I didn't! I just put everything away and quit; laid done and rested in from of the TV all evening. And didn't even feel too guilty about it. It occurs to me that I could continue on with a list of at least six reasons I have to justify quitting before I was drop dead exhausted, but then that would come from my type A side. So here it is, yesterday's big victory: when I first noticed I was getting tired I quit and rested!

I am often asked whether the weather affects my pain or not. Not nearly as bad as when I had the horribled arthritis in my ankles. That was clearly a ""yes"" to this question. There are times when I can't tell or not whether the weather affects me or not now. Yesterday and today it is clear to me that the weather does have an affect on my pain level. It is much worse than earlier in the week.

[Big pause to go take care of urgent business in the bathroom]

I was sitting on the toilet and had forgotten to turn my stimulator off first. In this position it is like having a stream of buzzing going up and down my legs. The toilet seat cuts off the flow of the buzzing. I was pushing hard and it was like IK blacked out for a half a second. Then I came right back. The whole experience was like watching a movie and one or two frames are skipped and then just goes on like normal. I have never had anything like this happen to me before.

It is now 5:40 PM and I am out of energy and just starting the second half of my second Actiq. It is couch potato time for the rest of the day."

"event","Donna, this one is for you especially! When we first started meeting I told you that I saw two paths before me. The one led to ever worsening depression, isolation, feeling sorry for myself; and eventual self destruction. The other was in the direction of walking the journey through the valleys of life's shadows with God as my companion. As far as I could see ahead on this path were saintly people who said things like, ""God created me with this painful affliction."" I have also heard people who took this path say things like, ""If I could magically take this affliction away I would not because I have gained so many insights, grown so much closer to God, and come to new understandings of life that have been such a blessing that these blessings far outway the trials and tribulations of my life. At the beginning of our journey together, and pretty much since then, I have told you that I didn't think I would ever reach such high and holy places in my life, but that I definitely wanted to travel in the direction of the second place, rather than the first; even if I never fully reached the place of those people.

Well, I found a couple new books on the Barnes and Noble website that look like they are going to be very helpful at this place on my spiritual journey. The first is, ""Meditations on Chronic pain and Illness: Peace in the Storm."" The author is Maureen Pratt, who has had lupus for more than a decade, and so speaks with the authority of personal experience. The second is, ""A Sacred Sorrow: Reaching Out to God in the Lost Language of Lament."" You know that that title is going to grab my attention immediately.

I have just started both books, but already they have my brain, and more importantly, my heart and spirit, churning and cogintating. I know that the eight stages of grief include  a time for sorrow; but ""lament"" means so much more than that. I feel like I have been given permission to lament as a stage of personal and spiritual growth. Sorrow seems like a solitary place of journey. Lament seems like a place of journey with God. Lament allows me to say anything I want/need to express, but to never leave God's side. I need to lament in my spiritual journey.

I'm not to the place of saying that the blessings of the journey are so much better than the pain that I would not give back my life of pain if it meant giving up the blessings that came with it. However, just today I gained a new insight into saying that God is responsible for creating me this way, including all the pain involved in my life.

I go back to  my insights from est/Landmark Education seminars and learning to say I choose my life as a way of owning who I am (including the pain) as apposed to living life as a victim of circumstances beyond my control. It now occurs to me that making the faith statement that God is responsible for making me the way I am is a faith statement that owns God as a partner in my struggles and this particular journey of mine.

I still hate it when someone else (especially someone who doesn't have any idea of life with chronic pain) says, ""God gave you this life of pain.. as a test of your faith.. in order to strengthen your faith..

However, if it is the person who is in this given situation (a life of chronic pain in this case) claims this as an affirmation of faith of who God is in relationship to me; then I can see that a confession of faith that says, God created this life of pain, this path/journey through the wilderness of suffering.. As one's own confession of faith, then to say that God created me and gave me this particular journey of faith that includes, and is deeply affected by it.. I can see that that is a powerful statement of faith. It is a valuable way of claiming who I am and in particular, who I am in relationship to God, my creator and constant companion who walks ths journey with me because He has gone on ahead of me in this journey of mine to make sure that there are not stumbling blocks too great for the two of us to take on together.  So, in that spirit I would like to claim for myself this affirmation of faith..

God created this particular life for me. God created this life of pain for me. It is God's path that I travel when I suffer and travel through this journey of life and of faith that includes everything about me, including my pain. Amen."

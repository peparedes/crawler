"event","It was great to meet up with the band.  I enjoyed our 3 hour session which wasn't long enough.  All and all, I wasn't happy with our session on many levels, but there were some good moments.

1. First of all, I was quite excited to use my new guitar, an Ebony colored, Epiphone Sheritan II Archtop (here's a picture of one---> http://www.geocities.com/delliversagain/my_guitar.htm )

But upon arriving, I realized that I forgot my guitar strap....*major boos*.  So, the bassist Jim gave me his as he was ok playing while sitting down.

I purposefully decided to rehearse on an empty stomach relying only on the beer and whatever other ""natural"" substances that may have floated about the room.  The studio room A was dark and moodily lit with blue walls and plenty space with a PA System and Mixer as well as two standing mics and holders.

We began by playing Stone Temple Pilots ""Creep"" a song I utterly hate...I just don't like the song as the lyrics are so annoyingly self-pity-ish.  We the decided to try an audioslave song ""Cochise"" which I completely surprised the band that I could scream that loudly and without emotion.  I did miss some notes, but my attempt was better than expected.

We then played ""Brand New Cadillac"" by the Clash which was actually quite fun though we did not know how to end the song and what was supposed to be a quick 2 minute song turned into a 10 minute song which was annoying...

We then played ""Plush"" a song which I sing quite well except for the verses which I have problems hitting the low notes.

I think we played ""show me how to live"" (another audioslave song) and my voice was pretty much killed after this one but I made some incredibly awesome screams.  I had no idea that I could scream that well.  By then, I had 4 beers in my system and then Jim, the bassist, made me smoke something...for all I know it could have been angeldust, but it had no effect on me as I'm naturally stoned out of my mind..if anything, it just made me angrier.

We then played ""three imaginary boys"" by the cure and I was so dumbfounded and out of it, that I couldn't remember the guitar solo so I was forced to only sing the song which upset me.

We then played Moonage Daydream and this was our loudest moment.  I sang it slightly off based and key because I was switching between the melodies of Bowie's version and The Chameleons version which made me sound off.  But the funny part was during the out-tro part where there's a solo at the end.  My guitar was not producing sounds so as the solo started, I was playing the guitar and trying to produce and affects setting when suddenly my guitar amp was screaming, hissing, and making this amazing wah wah sound that sounded completely psychedelic and was hilariously surreal...as Nige was using a E-bow, a magnetic devise that gives the guitar an interesting high pitched middle eastern bending sustained sort of sound and it was beautiful..but Jim the bassist, by then, completely stoned out of his mind after the song speaking at about 2 miles per hour sad: ""duddde...that...waaaasss ttooooooo llooooudddd'.""  It's funny talking to someone stoned on pot when they're irritated..they sound so passive you almost want to triple the volume level of the amp just to see if the temper will be more precise *lol*.

We then played Second Skin and finished playing one other song which I don't even recall now what it was.

I was pretty much completely wasted but mentally so wreckless that I really didn't feel anything and drove home as if I was just driving home from work: quite unphased and uninspired, even unimpressed.  I love being in recording studios because of the artistic energy in all the various studios.  There was 8 studio rooms and bands from all sorts of genres playing.  There were some rappers, heavy metal dudes playing Guns n Roses songs; a punk band; a thrash band; and emo band; and a rock band.

I thought my vocals were the best of all the rooms but I know that i could sing better.  I got electrocuted 5 times twice on my arms and 3 times on my lips as the mics were slightly broken so that if I put my lips to the mic without holding the mike (and thus grounding myself safely), I would light up from the current...That sucked.

At first, I thought it was just the beer, and it could have been as my lips were wet..but...dam that stung.

On top of that, I was annoyed at our set up.  We decide to play in a sort of circled with all the amps facing each other and it made it quite difficult for me to even hear my voice while singing which I was upset about.

The good news is that we were loud and had pretty decent timing.  I just know we could have done even better.

Hope you all are doing well: love peace, toilet paper, and sexual thoughts that make you think about going to a fitness center.

After that, we played Second Skin horribly and then played it again horribly."

"event","""The caffeine absorbed,
       life sucks both orally and emotionally.""

Yeah, I wrote that today, a nice bitter poem took over the controls of the big hurt air traffic controlling the emotional winter I've been living.

Anger is a natural reaction to heart break I suppose.  It was cool actually.  Ate some Peruvian food..though honestly, it's merely Spanish Paella if you want my opinion.

Band plays this thursday, June 3...the song ""London Calling"" I cannot wait to play that song.

I like to sing snogs...yeah deliberate typo, I thought twas funny.

exam on June 12th..freedom almost here.. I better pass that exam.  I will get, if it becomes like the previous years, a major migraine headache after the exam.  I have been working out and staying in shape....so that might save my health and keep the pain from exam mind frying to a minimum.

So, tell me, what do you think about anything?  Really?  Me too...I feel much better that we've developed a clearer understanding between one another.

good night

"event","She is an angel, Anna Netrebko.  She's a total prima donna smartass in interviews, but when she performs I always fall in love with her.  She is the most beautiful female performer I've ever scene.  Primarily her voice, smile, depth of her stare when she reaches within her soul to live up to the creative expectations of the composer who wrote the work she's interpretting.

She sung a Mozart, Puccini, Strauss and Rachmaninoff works.  Then in her encore she sung a famous Aria from La Boheme and something else.  She wore a reddish kimono like dress and very bright red (lightly close to orange-red) shoes.

Her shy smile was gorgeous, but her smile was also an embarrassed smile in that she was not used to singing recitals and performs the dramatic energy of singing opera.

Still, her voice and stage presence forces you to fall in hypnosis of her warm, dramatic, yet colorful soprano tones.

Ever since she walked next me when I was chaperoning a niece who had a role at the SF Opera and I was intoxicated by the depth of her stare, I've been a fan of opera and lover of everything she does musically.

Thanks for yet another wonderful performance Anna...you're a goddess of opera and a fixture to San Francisco."

"event","Took vocal lessons last Thursday.  What did I learn this time?  Started off warming up doing the stretching exercises I learned.

Then, I spent time learning the concept of breathing.  Things to note:

1. Keep chest out to allow maximum space for lungs to expand
2. Keep pelvis up
3. Head should be back and straight (if the chin is leaned forward, the voice is not strong enough as it causes the air and sound to resonate off the back part of the area behind the nose cavity causing the sound to slightly mute.
4. When taking the initial breath the stomach should expand
5. The face above the mouth should not move unnecessarily

Then, I read notes from the first assignment which talked about attitude, appearance, and most importantly, singing words that either begin with a vowel or consonant.

Learned that the tongue should not block the passage of air or sound as that causes the sound to mute.

Learned and worked on 9 vowel pronounciations:

AH, AW, OH, OOH, EH, EE, UH, AY, and IH 

Noticed that I didn't learn ""EYE"" or ""ah"" (as in cat).

I had to pronounced these vowels and depending upon the vowel, my mouth had to be opened in a different manner.

For example, the oh, ooh, ah, aw, and eh pronounciations require the mouth to be open wide in a vertical sense, whereas the ""EE"" required a wider opening as in smiling...and ""ay"" required a square like opening.

Looking in the mirror, I notice that I don't open my mouth wide enough while talking which causes me to speak in a nasal tone.  Speaking in a Nasal tone is caused because the mouth is not open wide enough and thus, the air and sound partially goes out the nose.  Try focus talking with your mouth slightly more open and you'll notice that you'll project a stronger voice.

Also, practice on breathing silently so as not to hear the breathing.  Makes a big difference on the strength of the voice.

Focus on speaking with deeper breaths.  This strengthens the diaphragm muscles which are those muscles in front of the lower rib cage and around the stomach region.

There was more notes...but I'm tired.  I need to finish chapter 6 today...I need to finish chapter 6 today.

How was your weekend?"

"event","Today, this weekend in fact, I was a tough son of a gun.  I've been feeling weak, down, depressed, and defeated.  And although I still feel that way, I have replaced my compassion with feelings of a stubborn toughness.

I love my world and the rest of this corrupted world can stay corrupted as far as I am concerned.  I've decided not to join the world of suffering inspite of my own pains.

I attribute this new esteem from an album that I treasure deeply.  Because of this album, my drive from Sacramento to San Pablo seemed like a 2 minute skip.

The album?  ""Life"" by Inspiral Carpets.  The album is filled with a tough Mancunian sort of hatred.  The music is like a stubborn love of life amid a storm of shit.  I'm glad I went to Manchester, England.  That city has a toughness of it that has rubbed off on me. 

I am planning a trip to Finland this September.  Why?  Because I feel like it.  I want to go to Scotland too, but that all depends if I can find my good mate, a drummer named Chiz.  He's a hard person to find because he's in various bands and projects of sorts.

Dam this song rules, called ""Monkey on my Back"" by Inspiral Carpets.....the lyrics to it:

http://members.iinet.net.au/~tyrian/lyrmonkeyomb.html

I'm just cranky at the moment...""and the sun, it don't shine....""  I really find it annoying when someone tells me, ""just remember that after the rain the sun always rises for a better day to come.""  That's utter bullshit....do you think the man who's life looks like the weather condition of Antarctica will place much reliance on such a cliche?

"event","Recieved my first day of voice lessons today.  Learned a lot of breathing and what actually causes a human to speak and what the role of the body is in speaking ""clearly.""

I learned the following today:

1. While singing, keep as fixed as possible everything above the lips; breathing should not be heard either..you naturally use your stomach/diaphragm muscles when you deliberately try to inhale without sound.
2. Keep jaws unlocked while singing
3. Always speak with a slight inhale like yawn
4. Excercise #1: (minimum of 6 reps): Lay on back, arms at side.  slowly inhale (thru nose) as your bring your arms up stretching out over until your arms touch the ground. Then exhale and bring the arms back.  The key in this exercise is to pace your breathing at a fixed interval and to develop the diaphragm muscles.
5. Exercise #2: (the circle/minimum of 6 reps): standing with your legs spread widely and knees bent.  as you inhale (thru nose), with your hands at side, rotate the arms in a circle slowly at the pace of the breathing as if you're reaching to the sky.  In one motion as your hands catch, reverse the motion while exhaling thru mouth.
6. Excercise #3: (called: ""picking up the dog""): this is just a good stretching exercise, while laying on stomach, do like a half push up and gradually lift your body but while keeping your feet on the ground, legs straight and hands on the ground.
7. Exercise #4: (...........forgot it :( )
8. Exercise #5: (rotating star): stand knees slightly bent with arms out so you look like a star.  Inhale thru nose while dropping left arm; exhale while lifting right arm; etc.etc.
9. Exercise #6: (the horse): this is some sort of tai chi exercise that I can't quite remember but good in the aid of breathing.
10.Exercise #7: (sustain and lung expansion test)..this just measures how long I can sustain a note... I got up to 21 seconds.
11. Oh yeah, keep chest out; face straight & forward."

Got two hits in two at bats and two walks.  Scored 3 runs and got 3, maybe four or five runs batted in.  I've had a good softball season so far.

Our team won 15-4... yay.

Bowling tomorrow..no I didn't get a 300 game or 600 series as promised last week..but I did bowl a 209 and it should have been a 260+..but I choked and got a 6 1 open frame in the 10th.

"event","Bowling night in Alameda...wooo hooo!  Today, I already know that I will bowl my first 600 series of the season and that I'll bowl a 300.  I just know it.

Song of the Moment:

""Busby Berkeley Dreams""--The Magnetic Fields

Purchased the 4 cd box set album by the Magnetic Fields known as ""69 Love Songs.""

Not bad.  ""Busby Berkeley Dreams"" is by far my favorite song.  My senses over the concept of love have become intensely strong recently.  I'm understand it more than I probably ever have known it, the whole concept of it.  If anything, I realize who she must be to be the perfect woman for me.  She must be extremely introverted, very difficult to break or understand (so that when I finally do know her she'll be like my own secret); she must not have a lot of friends and be the type of person who would prefer to be alone than to have a bunch of shallow friendships; she must love music; be extremely conversational when she's hanging out with me; and most importantly, I must hear music and be inspired by her to write poetry or music.  There are about 80-100 other things but I really do not want to scare her *lol* just in case she stumbles upon this.

Oh but back to ""Busby Berkeley"" dreams.  The song is beautiful and the lyrics...they're something else.  I really feel the writer's gut when he writes the chorus:

""I haven't seen you in ages, but it's not as bleak as it seems, we still dance on whirling stages, in my Busby Berkeley dreams....""

Ok everyone, be good, I will too.

love

"event","Let's see for me April...

High Points:

1. My first night in Buenos Aires April 7, 2004, when I was hanging out with my friend Paloma and she was helping me add minutes to my cell phone which, the women who owned the apartment I was renting, gave me to use.  I hadn't slept in about 36 hours at that moment when I asked Paloma to call my cell number with her number to test if my cell phone worked and when it rang, I was expecting it to be Paloma when it turned out to be by freak surprise, Lucila...""Hello, Tony?  This is Lucila...""  My heart beated with so much happiness that I couldn't stop fidgeting... ""Lucila!!! How are you????""...I said it with such an emotion, I remember her laughing after I said that.  I immediately stormed away from Paloma and Magali, to ""have some privacy""..uh...on the busy street of the intersection of Santa Fe and Pueyrredon during rush hour...which is around 8 or 9pm.  I'll always hold that memory of how happy I felt to have her company with me and how incoherent I sounded because I felt so happy that I was speaking too quickly for her to understand me and of course..cell phone connections are never clear.  I was pacing back and forth and using so much body language while I was talking to her that at one point, I accidently slapped someone because I moving my hands so much.  Just her voice...I will always remember that as the most beautiful song I ever heard in my life...

2.  In a Casino in Bariloche, Argentina, on Saturday night, April 10/11, having spoken broken Spanish all day and having a 5 minute conversation with a man playing this poker game (similar to Pai Gow poker)only to eventually find out after speaking to him all that time that he was a Londoner... How we both laughed our asses off when we realized that we thought each other to be Argentines...I was all alone, about 800 miles south of Buenos Aires surrounded by the Andes on the border of Chile and to have a one hour conversation in English was really refreshing.  His name was...*lol*...""Ribs.""

3.  I kissed more people, my 10 days in argentina than I had previously in the past 2 or 3 years.  I kissed a cab driver; my tailor; my travel agent, Jimena (such a wonderful woman who made all my travel arrangements for me), Paloma, Carolina, Vic, his two other beautiful female friends, Marta who rented my her apartment, Lucila (how my lips dried up like a shy desert, when they touched her cheeks as if I didn't want to ruin the softness of her face with the burning passions inside me)...there may have been a couple of other people I kissed too, but I can't remember now.

4.  Telling someone I loved them and really meaning it for the first time in my life.  I wrote an email to Lucila and basically told her that I traveled all the way to Argentina just meet her.  She freaked out initially but then felt a tremendous guilt and compassion for me.  I learned a lot about love this April.  I learned that in the past I had only been manipulated into telling people ""I love you"" and that I never really ever said those three words directly to someone I truly felt that way for.

5.  Hahaha...of course, hanging with my hot, young, wholesome, graceful, blonde bombshell in SR.

6.  Discovering that the spring rolls at Chevy's Rule.

Low-Points:

1.  Suffering a ruptured heart when Lucila said two words: ""my boyfriend"" whilst in my apartment (two days after my arrival in Buenos Aires) in Recoleta on two days without rest and crying for about an hour and confronting myself in the mirror and telling myself to be strong for myself and to love myself because if I can't love myself in my sadness, my love for lucila couldn't have been real...To look at myself crying in the mirror took every bit of strength I had.  I haven't cried so hard in my life.  And prior to that, I had never cried while alone.  Usually, the past times I've cried, there's usually been a person that would trigger such emotion, like my Aunt Ena who I cried to when my mother was dying in an SF hospital back in 1999.

2.  When I've actually had to work at my office here...yeah, that's always a low-point.  Luckily, it doesn't happen that often here *quick high pitched burst of laughter at the irony that this being posted in the ""low-points"" section*

3.  My irregular heart beat since Friday, April 9, 2004.  You ever step on an ant and didn't quite kill it and you sit it stand up slowly, perplexed, limping about trying to get back on the scent path that it was traveling on to find whatever goodies it was looking for?  I sort of felt like that for awhile..but I'm gradually getting back up."

Brilliant musician, Elliot Smith was...it's been nearly a year since we lost this brilliant man...dam, it's only been 6 months.  This has been one emotionally draining week for me.

Happy Birthday to my soul mate, some Taurus woman who I know completely and she exhales my life's story with a clarity that I never knew.  I found out why she knows me so well and I her...we're identical, feeling the identical pain and have the same eyes as if we're the same animal and suffer the same miseries and have the same love of life.

I was interviewing people for jobs today for some Accounting Technician position.  There was a young attractive Asian sorority UC Berkeley girl who made me laugh as she must've thought she had me wrapped around her finger.  She got the worst grade, not because of me, for I thought she interviewed well, but my female counterpart didn't like her and docked her score badly.  I love interviewing people because you get to look inside their souls as often, those who interview for positions really want the job they're applying for.

Of all the candidates, there was one woman who had the most beautiful eyes...her pupils were not black but rather a dark navy blue that really impressed me as I looked at the energy behind her enthusiasm.  I admired how much beauty her eyes saw....such a glitter.  She got a good score but not the best..but she was the best candidate to me.

But with all that life in her, it might be to much to ask for in a dead end company.

I'm beat; I really am.  But I swear to God...the pains I've felt recently are just my ego attempting to eat away my disacceptance of pain.  We all try to run away from our pains and I'm taking the force of it.  It will kill me eventually but I am fighting a war....my war and I will die to fight for what I believe in...who I love...what I love for.

My heart beat has still been irregular since Buenos Aires.  I'm meeting my father for dinner.  I didn't tell him that I went to Argentina...he'll freak out so I'll just sort of mention it in passing when we have dinner on Monday.  ""Yeah, oh by the way dad, I went to Buenos Aires for 9 days a few weeks back because I fell madly in love with a woman from there who i met online in a user group related to fans of Beethoven and just needed to see her to figure out why was it that merely the thoughts of a woman could turn my life inside out to the point where the pain of her rejection felt better than the joys and every laugh I ever experienced....

Yeah, Everclear was right in that song they wrote: 

""I don't want to hear you say that I will understand someday....""

I had a 1 hour 30 minute lunch that was horribly boring until after listening to the other 2 people discuss seriously boring topics of conversation like ""benefits at your company (oooh, aaaah)""; ""not being technically savvy""; ""the cost of home moving""; ""hiring practices""....finally after one hour and 10 minutes, I asked: ""so, what's your favorite movie???""  

""the lion king...""


lol.....actually, that was perhaps the most philosophically sophisticated conversation I've had in my office in at least 2 years.

""You and me talk freely at night, and this is my chaos....""---Idlewild...

I just hear music, songs, repeated over and over...work really is just something to feed my pains to keep me alive...

I worked out at the gym today...I was on a treadmill running as fast as I could while staring at a wall...""actually it's darkness, I don't know what I'm scared of; it's darkness, I must be scared of something....quite quite special...you shed a shade of shyness....""

I was told by someone early today that I am a ""generous and sensitive soul.""  I wrote her 12 sonnets and 11 haikus and spent 6 hours after work (was at the office until 10pm) trying to add graphics to the poem. 

Maybe I'll post them a sonnet at a time.

""annihilate now!  annihilate now!  annihilate, annihillate now!""

Wow, I'm still typing it's almost 2am and I cannot seem to get tired...ah Stella Artois...Belgian leuven...""are you all alone? you're selling your soul.....""

Looking around my apartment what do I see?  I see my monitor (duh), a huge copy of Kimt's ""the kiss"" which I still haven't hung and it's been 2 years.  an auto insurance bill on the floor;..Everything But The Girl's ""Worldwide"" cd..my favorite album by them....

""Drowning here in Summer's Cauldron under mats of flowing lava, please don't pull me out this is how I would want to go""....damn that's a beautiful lyric by XTC (skylarking..that album is pretty much it all wound up in the layers of my thoughts....)"

"event","I've been back since December 13th actually, but have been quite busy.  London is a great city.  I expect that I'll be there again sometime soon. I regret not having gone there sooner.  The people are beautiful men and women alike.  It's a crowded busy city with many pockets of calm and quiet.

Where it's busy it's not all that annoying but the people are always on the rush amid their silence. My highlights included seeing a symphony at the Royal Albert Hall near Waterloo Bridge, riding the London Eye and having a picturesque view of London at night.  Dim Sum in Chinatown over near Piccadelly Circus in Soho was great.  Hearing Coldplay's ""Clocks"" at the HMV in Piccadelly Circus.  Getting lost and walking through an Indian mystical restaurant walking thru it to get to the main street (wherever that took me) as people appeared to be breathing the steam of tea out of a huge stainless steel bong.

Ah the London Underground, the tube, what a place to watch people.  In the trains you're forced to stare at the person in front of you creating lots of joyous sexual tension and whispery shy eye contact.  Brick street where there were many stores selling Hallal, a Muslim term for food that is ok to eat according to the Qu'ran.   The bagels and the cute blue-eyed girl that gave me directions to brick street who's eyes told me she was composing a song on my eyes, yet it was me who was composing a poem in my mind on her beautiful courteous eyes.

Sipping London's Finest, a lager, in a sidestreet pub off of London's busy, fashionable Oxford Street.  Walking up to use the men's room when I said ""pardon me"" to a local cockney who was offended: ""pardon me? what's up with that?""  Then I apologized and said, ""sorry, matey.""  ""ahh, that's better, you gotta speak the cockney way around here mate, aye?""

The greasy fish and chips and the Vietnamese woman serving my sparkling water who gave me a horrible fish soup that cost $20US.  The escalators, steep, four of them (two going up, two going down about 50 meters in diagonal length) in some stations like Liverpool Street Station and Bond Street, the ultimate flirtation of stares of the lovely and fashionably dressed women of London, possibly the most beautiful women in the world, looking down winky eyed and the men staring at men and women staring at women, old men staring at teenagers, the excitement of attraction recogination of both directions created a melancholic lonliness amid everyone going both directions...how could one not fall in love 100 times a day on the way to work?  What if a woman screamed, ""you! the man with the black leather jacket, I love you so much I'll marry you on the spot"" and what if she was the most perfect looking woman on the planet?  What could you do other than watch her slowly disappear from you as she goes down and you go up?  It's not love but rather, the classic London flirtation.  For if I ran to the top of the stairs, and ran back down to find her, she will have disappeared to one of 3 to 5 train lines that all go in different directions.  Love is melancholic yet refreshing in London.

The Tate Modern Museum, a quiet upside down sunset surrounded indoors by gloomy dried iced fog and blue side lights.  Seeing students sitting in front of paintings drawing their own sketches.  A young girl staring at me nudging her best friend as they gave me the eye and made me laugh.  That useless video art of a women singing ""happy birthday"" distortedly and visually blurred movements and sound in 90rpm making the sound and imagery undiscernable.  A young 13 year old boy walking out, (disgusted at the ""work of art"") of the booth proclaiming, ""it's crap, pure and utter crap...""

Looking from the it's fifth floor in the cafe at a fragment of the Thames.  Seeing one exhibit that was simply a large drawer of things excavated from the Thames, bottle caps, crisp packages, a lonely poem written by a depressed man.

The National Museum and Trafalgar Square's grand view.  Two Lion Statues giving powerful hypnotic trance to a large square in the middle of compact, busy buildings and flashes from tourists taking pictures.  People from everywhere, India, Peru, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Morocco, the Carribean, the diversity of London was unexpected.

Walking down King Street at night in the Chelsea District, hearing flamenco music warmly performed from a Spanish Restaurant then looking at a stylish dress in Guinevaras, some Italian women's clothing store.

Kurt Masur conducting Britten's ""Simple Symphony"" the second movement of only pizzicato's from the stringed instruments made us all giggle and feel tickled by it's titillaton.

The double decker buses, various lines, remember the 388 line which dropped me off the foot of the Tower Bridge.  Westbourne Park, trying to find Lucky 7's an American diner when a local street monitor (and his cute orange flourescent vest--you'd have thought there was a flood some place) tried to help me for directions.  ""Well, it's either left or right.""  *laughs* wasn't so helpful but he guessed correctly as I turned right.  People walking dogs without leashes.  Dogs seemed to be guarding every corner market store, though docile and unthreatening even if pitbulls1.

The humidity, London fog is different from San Francisco fog, which is bright and obvious.  London fog is invisible yet felt in the cool, crisp, still air.  My forehead was sweaty my entire stay there.  No need to cry in London as the air does it for you in the wistful mist.

The Piccadelly Line, the Northern Line, the City Line, the Bakerloo line (in Brown), the District and Circle Line.  Somehow you never really stopped walking by men playing blues guitar very similar to Clapton, a girl playing a cello, music everywhere, including a choir of African American girls singing gospel.

London is a city that makes you feel like wind, that lifts you up to see all of that's around you that pertains to what your whim is curious of.

London, a home to all."

been on a bit of a downer for a while me and spug broke up.
been with a few guys since then but no-one really matches up with him it sucks.
jeez i just realised i aint updated this god-damned thing for months. shit must start updating more. im going to find more friends list ppl too. mine is just rejected all i have is my k.t and marsh. they're still going out which is pretty cool. marsh and me get on better now we all went to this party last weekend and got really high and me and him had this big talk and sorted out all this shit between us. made kt pretty happy so lil miss b has been on a happy pill all week.

fuck i hate being so down. i miss spug. america was sooo amazing and it made me think we would stay together forever. i mean, he said its a break and we are still like best friends but it makes no difference i want to get back now never mind summertime.

im not perfect. i know that. cheating is the worst mistake i could have ever made.

aaaaaanyway on a lighter note, we might get back togetha. and ive been to lots of good gigs recently and loads comin up in summer. and ive bought loads of new cds . ooo that reminds me ....  when we were over in the US we went and saw the ataris record store it was pretty amazing!!!!and i bought a CD there!!! no-one else seems impressed by that but HELLOOOO???? unfortunatey the guys werent there, didnt expect they would be but oh well what can one do ha ha .

america was a fucking once in a lifetime trip. i'll write all about it in my next entry but just now cant be bothered.

me and kt are bot gonna apply to the same five universities in the following cities:
London
Manchester
Birmingham
Glasgow
Edinburgh

i think scotland would be pretty cool but i dunno kt thinks its too far away and stuff so im thinking wherever she goes i go!!! but hello? what a choice! i dont want to stay in london. i wanna get outta here.

anyway better go kt is coming over and she'll whinge at me if im moping about here listening to sad songs and wishing for my ideal punk guy again...

Spug and me are going to maybe be going to America at Christmas! His band are meant to be joining some tour thing and if they do, im going to be their groupie yahayyyyy!!!!!

Katie is feeling a bit happier today, i'm glad. i love her so much and i don't want her to be unhappy. And Marshall - sorr for being mean about you , i didn't mean it .

Well, i'm off to beddibies now, me and Spug are going to the cinema to see american pie two tomorrow, should be enterteining, since i loved the first one, and Stifler is yum! After i think we'll go to the pub to meet his friends from Manchester who are down for the week. Never met them before, they are in no doubt probably a bunch of multicoloured hair immature punkers!

Anyways, time for bed, and dreams of Spug and me's crazy adventures in America with the band!

This is a fair request, and I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager. You will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin, and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope-addicts or glue-sniffers. 

You think its strange, that there's a way
of how you looked, and how you act, and how you think
pretend they're not the same as you.

Do you know about her strength in convictions
or how she puts all her faith in religion.
Did we take the time to really discover,
how little we know about each other.

Keep us from saying anything.
Can't separate from everything.
And all this really means is
you're one in a crowd
and you're paranoid of every sound.
You're not the friend
you won't miss anyhow.

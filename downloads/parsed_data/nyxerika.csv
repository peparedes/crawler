"event","Once upon a time, in a universe somewhere between 616 and whatever the movieverse is called (199999?), Tony Stark got bored. Again. Or maybe Clint found Cap the Granada adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, and then Steve wouldn&#39;t stop talking about how&nbsp;Jeremy Brett is seven million times better than Basil Rathbone, and smarter too, until Tony got jealous and decided to be better than both.

Obviously, he failed, but the attempt was a valiant one!

Why yes, I did buy the rights to <i>Sherlock Holmes </i>just to see what I look like in Victorian clothes! Well, in Steampunk clothes. Edwardian? In vests! and hats. And cravats, but we already know I know how to rock those.

And you say this Watson is a warrior <i>and </i>a doctor? Impressive. But the Captain will not accept this role?

HI TONY! I finished with Fury early so he got someone to drop me off here. Um. That&#39;s not your costume, is it? I thought this was a Victorian picture.

I know what it&#39;s not, Tony, and it isn&#39;t that coat. I think my dad had that coat. I think <i>Bucky </i>had that coat. And&nbsp;I know that&#39;s my hat. My hat isn&#39;t Victorian, Tony. In fact, if that outfit is Victorian I can be Dracula if I just...do...this.

There, okay? That is at LEAST Steampunk, Steve, it&#39;s definitely not from the 20s or 30s. Right? If you dad had this coat then you had a more exciting childhood than you have led us to believe, alright, and if Barnes had it I bet he stole it from an old guy, and that guy was Victorian at some point. ish. Now go do something useful, okay?

1. my favourite version of this evar
2. I still like Benvolio and Mercutio best
3. This country is still much too hot
4. Viennese coffee is the only kind I'll drink this happily and not just because of all the cream (rahm)
5. I had Kaiserschmarren today! It was kinda like french toast cut into diamonds but I liked it anyway. 
6. I have eaten the weirdest meals today (dinner was Kaiserschmarren which is actually a dessert, then I came home and ate little wurstchens with mustard and curry sauce (the sweet german stuff) and zach said WTF and then discovered he liked them too and commandeered half, before that I had strawberry+fudge ice cream with jenny and before THAT chicken winglets and earliest of all a chinese pear.)

coughjennyhackcough everywhere, I don't know where the nudists come in. Even the Darths C are taking time off today, apparently- the one dispenses advice about the merits of romancing boring people for money while the other skips class entirely just because it's possible. 

English Class Topic = Science and Technology. I foresee lessons even more hopeless than the ethnocentricm ones, oh joy. Math = still differentiation + failed test + teacher cross with me, triple joy.

On the other hand we ARE getting closer to the IR in history and that will be pleasing indeed. Why am I talking about this? Because the things that occupy my somewhatmessedupmind at the moment are so hopeless they aren't even worth discussing. Having said which, they seem to spill out in strange situations. Tus far: over eggplant in that Anatolia restaurant with MD and Sabr[iii]ina or dashing down a corridor before assembly or in between [studying the processes of] purifying metals and plating objects in Choa Chu Kang. This is getting ridiculous, not to mention PAINFUL, so there is not much to say except I hope it ENDS soon. Or moderately soon, because the only thing I will be more horrified by than feeling like this is not feeling like this which seems like exactly the sort of teenage thing I am always afraid I will find myself thinking so THERE YOU GO I QUIT YOU WIN I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE someone shoot me and be done with it.

Also I hate performance tasks especially in math with supercillious math teachers imPLYing things annoyingly about talks and the usefulness thereof. Too many people forcing my hand in too many directions even withOUT being pressured into talks about one-way-street problems, whatever those may be. 

Yes alright no more grumbling.

I adore Static, and the new[ish/er] season of X-Men: Evolution is fairlypleasing though I STILL OBJECT TO KURT'S TERRIBLE ACCENT and Forge looked sortadodgy.

Brilliant the only things I have to be happy about are mutant teenagers.

We will work on this eventually, first we must go back to preventing an even worse catastrophe from occurring by the end of next week.Malay is odd, we are doing debate motions all the time. Today we had a three-way debate in which everyone was opp, which was pretty funny because we were rebutting each other's points and then developing them as substantive. and this is in a class of six; the class upstairs did it with about twelve groups. Entella is being nice to me again, it's a funny funny thing. Not that I'm not grateful for it, I just don't always know what I did exactly. SS tomorrow is going to be good, I think; the only teacher who tells me what I want to know if I ask [and take the time to sift through all that evasion for the answer I'm looking for]. Assembly will be as usual buy what more do we ever expect? No change if no one asks for it, and all that. Finally a vaguely interesting English assignment, and of course we'll spend about fifteen minutes on it in class when it happens. 

It's not funny how busy we are doing nothing.  

Having said that this randomtraipse has done a GREAT great deal in the way of replenishing vibes and equipping me with Lasting skills, and tomorrow I shall cement this over the empty math block. Happy. [Otherhalf I do not think it can be a good thing that I have a Padawan to think of and yet I get maybe a third of my energy from an almostmindlink with a Sithling.] So thank you for that, and see you tomorrow. I really am very very glad I haven't lost ALL my spontaneity because then I really would be becoming <s>one of them</s> a -debater at heart-, and you know I have higher ambitions than that."

Those royal fools at Madrid sort of beat the Italian models of perfection!{<--1-0 Juve] 
Indignance, annoyance and general crossness abound.

BUT / HOWEVER / SAVING-GRACE-LY / SORRY LONDON:

Here is the <a href=""http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/en/news/matchreport/2005/03163.php?fcb_sid=e548e048b23c0e0baecb7729eec052a7"">only really important and decidedly GOOD news</a>. I swear this fixes migraines much more effectively than Zomitriptan and all those odd things. They are so wonderful, I say staunchly, and so considerate too. Scoring in the FIRST FIVE MINUTES so I could actually  see it live and lucid before I started to fall asleep on my feet [in the dark-and-silent so parents wouldn't figure me out], how polite is that. My defence makes me happy, oh yes. Captain Kahn <s>unfortunately</s> remains uninjured and able-to-play, but at least he appears to have won the Goalkeeper Challenge the German press has been jumping about over. [And may I just say, he has won this unilaterally because our friend Hans-Jorg deserves to be SHOT. Three puddle goals will NOT do, oh no.] 

Anyway, yes, nice margin for a home game, for the next go we just keep it contained and maybe unleash machine-gun Makaay on them at suitable intervals. So much for Arsenal being an Earth-shattering force, huh.  

In unrelated happynews, Sammy Kuffour's second son is going to be born in May, which as you know is an excellent month to be born in. Also an excellent family, especially after poor beautiful Godiva, and an excellent country [I say predictably]. So yes, a happy baby will soon be had, may he be named Michael, Tristan or Alex. 

[Elizabunny I told you what would happen if we won this and I think I must be right. Hasta siempre, onwards to victory and all that.]"

For the record I do think about it, though.

This is how I've been feeling recently, odd things have been happening since early this week to show me what I should be doing, and where and why and how. [No, I'm not trying to get to Munich tomorrow for the Bayer04 rematch.] Suffice to say I don't like changing paradigms, but also that I really like our SS teacher for all his pronouncements can be a bit odd from time to time. [I still contend that the wool trade, whether industrial or not, is just plain EVIL because of the detriment it brought to Irish Catholics and their poor spiked children, so THERE Herr SSMann.] Sorry coolamanda for involving you in that.

It would have been incredibly depressing if not impossible to face a whole year of Being a Senior without any of the really lovely teachers [save the orals lady and perhaps the somewhat uncomforting Darth C. [Yeah, so I'm just complaining AGAIN about life without ProfX2 and the RS]. It occurs to me that now we have <i>re-established contact</i> [thankye otherhalf] I might be less fond of Entella than I have been this week. 

<i>No</i>, even I can stick to a new year's resolution for more than a week.

Muchly I hope no one from our best-beloved institution comes across this list; we will be in way over our heads if the good ladies decide to dissect that paragraph to see who is who. [The orals lady naturally will find herself immediately and work from there, in no time at all we will be found out AND ALL WILL BE LOSSSST.]

I could talk about the debbies but it would make at least two of us depressed so that will come tonight or another day.

RS News: Sie ist leider healthy, happy and quite bouncy. Apparently she misses her students a bit [COULD ANYONE BLAME HER] but has been telling the RussianRevolution stories anyway [A-nas-ta-sia say I] to good effect. Sie war nicht in Sri Lanka but in India, which JUSTIFIES MY CONCERN and proves that when I say AYII MY FOOTBALLERS AYII THE RS I am usually not far off the mark since both turned up in the general region.

This is A Plan of Strangeness and ChineseNewYeardom.
See right.
I have always thought it must be fun for teachers to get visitors at Chinese New Year. I have, however, neither any teachers [left at RGPS] nor any ChineseNewYearness so have never contributed to this myself. 
So.
I am thinking, if we are neither overworked nor otherwise committed, we should go THERE instead and say YO RS HAPPY UM JANUARY because she will have no visitors [since secondary schools don't GET those] and probably no particularly friendly students [yet]. I am thinking, it would be quiiite fun to pay a random student to say [RS] You GOTTA come out I need to talk to you about ESSAYS and be waiting there, beamingly. 
Except.
I don't know what their arrangement IS, I don't know whether it's ALLOWED and I certainly don't know whether she won't cut and run as soon as she can manage it. 

Is this worth attempting? I kind of think it might be fun[/ny] if it isn't disastrous."

Presently I am in love with Mathias Edenborn, in awe of Florence Kasumba and delighted by Joel Karie. It is pretty much impossible to explain WHY everything is more wonderful in German, but it IS. At the moment I really, REALLY wish I had more African hair. I mean, this stuff is FLAT, and it doesn't MOVE except when it waves limply, and it absolutely cannot be braided. Not that cornrows are encouraged in the Raffles schools. Back to which, Frau CCF seemed very good-natured and happy-like about everything, did not scold me as I expected or fully take the side of the 3M. Details are available but not strictly exciting, so.

Teddy has something called a DS- which does not stand for Deutsche Superstar [Elli], whom I was going to vote for when Taufik got Singapore into World Idol, only now there might not BE a World Idol so the 100 STOP SLY votes I begged, bothered and DRAGGED out of people may have been perhaps not as useful as I would have hoped- and it is making him strangely happy. Eli has DS too, only hers is more DEBATE STRESS than DUAL-SYSTEM because the 3M is being IMPOSSIBLE with training and such. Venue not a problem anymore since I have discovered a Clever! way to comb my hair to hide the bits that aren't supposed to be there. 

In the absence of my Otherhalf I have been reading Random things to supplement my now-quite-substantial understanding of Marvel families. I now know a bit about the FF [like The Human Torch SO much] and quite a lot about Wolverine, as well as more about The Avengers [still think Thor is loverly but like Quicksilver too now, do NOT like The Vision]. This makes me feel quite clever but, of course, annoys the 3M to death- which hardly makes for contributions to a Happy, Peaceful Home Environment. 

GermanRadames does that.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, has been a summary of how NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ME worth reporting, and as such a justification of LONG PERIODS OF NOT-THERE-NESS. Yes.

ENGLISH: Ignore completely, hope for the best. Write fast. 
LIT: Read Nandita's MSN-able lit package since <i>You Bloody Refused to do Yours.</i>

MALAY: STUDY WHAT YOU CAN YOU STUPID GIRL. I know you want to speak German all your life. I know you don't like the way they slant lessons. <i>Just do it, you only have to last ONE year more and then we're free to do German and only that.</i> So peribahasa [proverb things] and karangan formats, okay.

SS: Just read the notes, and listen to your CD. try not to get mad at entella every time the song we used in our lit dramatisation is played. 

CHEM: EVERYTHING. YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING. STUDY EVERYTHING. ASK FOR HELP. A LOT. TRY AND PASS.

MATHS: SEE ABOVE. Okay, Remainder Factor maybe I can do. Kind of. EVERYTHING ELSE THOUGH.

HISTORY: Stalin and Hitler. Forget China, China is pointless. 
Why study history when chem and math are dying? <b>This one is a priciple thing. You have GOT to do well in this useless exam BECAUSE YOU HAVE: 
1. to make up for your stupid performance task which she STILL HASN'T RETURNED probably out of spite.
2. to go to Germany.
<i>3. promised RS you will do well in her last year With the Top Flight</i>
4. a reputation to start establishing, man. How you gonna study World War history at university if you can't do it at sec three, yo?</b>"

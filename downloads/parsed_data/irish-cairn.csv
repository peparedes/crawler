Aries
March 21
- April 19 	Aries 	It's going to be an interesting day, complete with the possibility of a visit from the green-eyed monster. And when it comes along, you really shouldn't blame yourself. Jealousy is in the air. Doesn't mean you actually did anything to inspire it, much less that you're responsible for its arrival. Your only defense is to be honest, stand your ground and try to explain what happen. After that's done, your part of the project is over.
Taurus
April 20
- May 20 	 Taurus 	Someone you're quite intimately involved with may seem to be a bit cranky today, to say the very least. Does this mean it's over between you, or that there's really nothing to do about the current situation? Not at all. The first thing to do is to start up a conversation -- gently -- about the problem. Let them know you want to understand what's going on. If they don't want to talk, there's not much you can do about it, except to wait until they are.
Gemini
May 21
- June 21 	Gemini 	A dear one seems to be completely out of control and totally irritated with you. Regardless of what you say, they may not believe you're telling the truth. Yes, it's going to be a challenging day. But for some reason, you'll manage to find the patience you need to get through it. All you have to do is pretend you're in their shoes. That, and let them know you're willing to talk.
Cancer
June 22
- July 22 	Cancer 	You're not quite sure of what's going on with a friend or coworker, but you know you don't like it. They've been acting oddly for some time, but today it seems to have come to a head. The one thing you're sure of is that the anger and jealousy they're turning in your direction aren't deserved. Still, you'll be able to put your hurt feelings aside and be rational. Nice going. It won't be easy, but you'll be so proud of yourself afterward.
Leo
July 23
- August 22 	Leo 	After all the shopping you've done recently, you thought you were through with the mall -- in fact, you were praying you were done for the sake of your credit rating. But an occasion has come up for you to buy presents for your dear ones. You want to let them know how special they are. Well, here's a thought: Why overspend, when it's really just a bit of your time they want?
Virgo
August 23
- Sept. 22 	Virgo 	You've just about had it with the veiled comments and sarcastic remarks that have been tossed your way lately on a far too regular basis. It's probably family members that have been at it, but regardless, you're ready to stop being nice and fight back. Well, good for you. Why put up with something you know you don't deserve -- especially when you know you'd never do this to them? Words can hurt far worse than weapons, if they're aimed at the heart.
Libra
Sept. 23
- Oct. 22 	Libra 	This is just one of those days when even you, with your remarkable ability to make peace, restore balance and bring warring factions into balance won't be able to work your magic. Your peace-loving little self may find it necessary to hide out from the world temporarily, and there's nothing wrong with that. You can only do so much. If others won't cooperate, putting some distance between you and the ruckus isn't a bad move. Taking an understanding friend along wouldn't hurt, either.
Scorpio
Oct. 23
- Nov. 21 	Scorpio 	It's time for you to admit something: Your values have changed. What used to be important no longer matters. That means it's time to make some corresponding outward changes -- some big ones. Fortunately, you're more than ready, even if it means saying good-bye to people, things or ways of life that were once primary to you. Don't worry about it. You'll get through this the same way you get through everything. Bravely.
Sagittarius
Nov 22
- Dec. 21 	Sagittarius 	Flinging a chair around the room won't help. You'll feel a little bit better, but not much. At the moment, you may even be convinced that you had every right, but you're only going to feel guilty afterward -- which, as very few people know about you, actually happens pretty easily. If you're trying to work something out between you and a dear one, hold it back. You may not win, but you'll definitely feel better about yourself in the morning.
Capricorn
Dec. 22
- Jan. 19 	Capricorn 	Someone whom you haven't seen in a long time -- possibly someone who may actually have moved or been away -- seems to be making trouble for you from behind the scenes. You may be right -- but then, you may be wrong. Better be sure before you say or do anything that will put you in an irreparably bad position with them. Check your sources before you make that long-distance call.
Aquarius
Jan 20
- Feb. 18 	Aquarius
	Two friends of your -- both of whom mean a great deal to you -- have recently found it necessary to go out of their way to tick you off. At least, that's the way it seems. It's worked, too, better than it should have. You're not just angry, you're furious. Before you let go and let them have it, though, you might want to be sure you're right. Feeling righteous is far better than feeling guilty.
Pisces
Feb. 19
- March 20
	 Pisces 	The higher-ups in your life have been less than understanding lately -- all of them. That goes for family members, elders and authority figures in general. You've gone out of your way to keep doing what they just recently told you were the right things to do. But now you're a bit confused. If that same intensity leaks over into your other relationships, try to be patient. This, too, shall pass. Promise."

Went to Claire's for dinner tonight and still haven't escaped... Met her family for the first time and was surprised at how well her folks have taken to me considering how we've just sprang our plans on them ... Her da's just nipped out for more boose, sitting here drinking whiskey with him, which makes me mental I'll have to watch what I say tonight. Like him though Diamond Geezer!!!
They want me to stay here tonight but I think I'd better stagger back to our new pad in Stirling as I'll get nothing done tomorrow otherwise.
Aw well back to reality tomorrow and get my finger out and stop being a slacker with my mates.
Hope to see some of ya tomorrow

"event","Star Sign  	Prediction
	  	 
Aries
March 21
- April 19 		Who's in control here -- you, or someone further up the chain of command? Be honest with yourself and use your wisdom rather than your ego when going about your duties. Share your responsibilities and you'll get the added benefit of some fun companionship as well as lightening your load. Right now, charm will serve you better than toughness. As you relax and pay attention to the people around you, the truth of a situation will become clear.
Taurus
April 20
- May 20 	  	Hard work yields pleasing results and proves that momentum is the key to your success. Once you get going, you may find yourself exceeding expectations long before you're ready to quit. This is a great time to start a new health program or an art project. Once you start, people around you are bound to take notice. Share your new plans with friends or family; they will provide you with useful help and suggestions. Take the time to rest up and build your enthusiasm, then don't let anything stop you!
Gemini
May 21
- June 21 		Duty calls repeatedly today, while you just want to answer the siren song of fun and games. Your day improves when you find a playmate who shares your desire to escape. The secret to success is to follow your impulses creatively: Do a routine chore slightly differently, or wear something special to make your day perk up. A little rebellion is a good thing. You are in charge of entertaining yourself. Luckily, you're really good at it.
Cancer
June 22
- July 22 		Be on the lookout for obstacles in business and romantic partnerships. Excess activity on oft-traveled ground stirs up many issues. Be cautious about starting something new -- you may want to wait until people feel as if they're back on their feet. Be careful in dealings with your colleagues and loved ones, and take some time off if feelings run high. Try to figure out your own priorities and be understanding of the needs of others. Remember to keep calm in negotiations and do not be afraid of compromise; it may be the best way for everyone to come out a winner.
Leo
July 23
- August 22 		It's a great time to meet and impress new people. You radiate confidence, attracting potential partners like flies to honey. In love and art, you are nearly unstoppable. Use your magic touch to bargain for something you've been wanting or to ask a question you've been avoiding. Even though everyone pays attention to you, don't overextend yourself. You could say anything right now and people would believe you, but it might help if you mean it.
Virgo
August 23
- Sept. 22 		Have you heard the saying, 'In order to make money, you've got to spend money'? If you want to get in the game, you must come up with the admission fee. At least this money will be helping you toward a greater goal. Buy the things that you need to get what you want or to send you where you want to go. Your purchases will be noted, and your investments will have far-reaching effects on those around you. Be optimistic, but don't throw common sense out the window.
Libra
Sept. 23
- Oct. 22 		While your tendency is to be all things to all people, make it a point to please yourself at this moment. You are centered, balanced and a tangible force of love. Others are attracted by the harmony you wear like a mantle. Allow your grace to carry you through your day. Flirt, but only with the ones who really catch your eye. Visit friends, but only the ones that please you the most. You can make friends and influence people with a wave of your hand. All you need to do is make the gesture.
Scorpio
Oct. 23
- Nov. 21 		Your train of smooth and steady progress gets derailed by indecision. It may be difficult to make a choice when you consider how much is at stake. Not to worry: You have time to find the answer. Reassess the situation on your own, since advice from others may only the cloud the situation. Only you have the patience and understanding to figure out what you need. Try taking walks alone or spending time at home. Some solitary thinking will help make your decision easier.
Sagittarius
Nov 22
- Dec. 21 		Sagittarians receive a delightful complication via another, smaller archer named Cupid. New romances blossom, or old ones heat up again -- or maybe both. Someone special finds you irresistible. With this new excitement may come hard decisions. Be honest and kind about what you want and what you are feeling and you will be rewarded. Clear communication will bring serious passion into your life. A hot evening lies in wait.
Capricorn
Dec. 22
- Jan. 19 		It's in your best interest to finish old business before starting anew. Accept help as it is offered and use it as needed. Sharing the reward is a small price to pay for closure. Compromise will bring much-needed peace and harmony into your life. Conflicts with those in authority may leave you unsatisfied, but you can find balance through staying focused on what you need. Getting it done is more important than getting all the glory.
Aquarius
Jan 20
- Feb. 18 	
	Take some time out and get to know a new acquaintance, culture or start a new course. Get intellectual and explore the world -- you'll find it rewarding. Figuring out what makes other people tick gives you unexpected insight about your own situations. You are very open to new information and ideas, so let your curiosity be your guide. By taking in many new things, you may discover how much you have to give.
Pisces
Feb. 19
- March 20
	  	You understand the nature of secrets, even when they're difficult and inconvenient. If someone shares something with you, don't worry about giving advice -- just listen. Be careful about your newfound knowledge -- in this case, discretion is definitely the better part of valor. Keeping the faith will put someone important in your debt. Your integrity will open the door to more confessions -- if you want them, that is."

Aries
March 21
- April 19 		You're more observant than usual, especially when you stand to benefit from your discoveries. Your eyes are open wide and nothing escapes your gaze. This is a great day for detective work. You find it easy to stay one step ahead of those around you. You shine with an inner light. The excitement that surrounds you motivates everyone else to have a more positive attitude.
Taurus
April 20
- May 20 	  	The chickens are coming home to roost, so get out there and make sure that chicken coop is ready for guests. The sooner you deal with the past, the sooner you can get started on finding an opportunity in this situation. Avoid power struggles with someone in a position of importance later in the day. Your interests are best served when you keep smiling and make it look easy.
Gemini
May 21
- June 21 		Sometimes things really are just as good as they look! Today you are surprised to find that the substance of an attractive person matches up to his or her image. You could fall in love easily, although why complicate a perfect friendship? The choice may not be entirely up to you. You are tempted to throw caution to the wind. Don't rush into a hasty decision -- let things develop naturally.
Cancer
June 22
- July 22 		The more you strive to be number one, the less fun you seem to be having. Is this really how you want to be spending your time? Rethink your priorities and goals to make your life more enjoyable. Nobody's perfect, so why do you expect it of yourself? Call up old friends or family and do some heavy-duty relaxing today. It's the cure for what ails you.
Leo
July 23
- August 22 		You begin to understand a vast, underlying pattern later in the day. It's even easier to excel when you understand why it's happening. Your abilities and desires come together in a perfect match. Your coworkers look on with a mixture of awe and envy. When you're on fire like this, no one needs to fan the flames of your success. This is the perfect time to get your ideas out of your head and into the right hands.
Virgo
August 23
- Sept. 22 		Are you the hunter or the hunted today? Sometimes your position changes depending upon what you (or the other party) are looking for. It's a good thing you like this game (and are so good at it), but make sure you don't take it too seriously. That means no lashing out at folks who don't get the rules of how this situation works as quickly as you do. Work on winning allies right now.
Libra
Sept. 23
- Oct. 22 		Get ready to be a part of the action today. You enter a period of leadership where all eyes will be on you. You depend on others for affirmation even as they look to you for guidance. The sooner you learn to stand on your own two feet, the better. Second-guessing yourself has no place in this new role. Delegate as many of the details as possible so that you can concentrate on your vision.
Scorpio
Oct. 23
- Nov. 21 		Daydreaming may serve you very well right now. Imagining a better situation is the first step toward making concrete improvements, so let your mind wander where it will. Plan out the steps in your head before committing them to paper. If the task proves to be too much for one person to handle alone, find allies to help you enact your changes. Be careful not to stay with the process you set in motion -- your leadership is needed every step of the way.
Sagittarius
Nov 22
- Dec. 21 		Spend some time in a natural environment today. Take a long walk in the park or visit a nature conservatory. Even sitting in your own backyard is better than staring at the television or computer screen. Your interior landscape is a pretty healthy place, but you can always freshen it up with outside influences. Be sure to leave the place as clean as it was when you arrived. Travel may be in the cards for this evening. Make sure you pack appropriately for the weather conditions at your destination.
Capricorn
Dec. 22
- Jan. 19 		Old challenges turn into new obstacles today. Business issues rise to the surface as you are faced with a seemingly insurmountable hurdle. Be prepared for any contingency when asking for assistance -- you may not get much help from the people who could give it easily, so have a back-up lined up just in case. Try not to blame someone for your issues -- he or she may be having problems of which you know nothing. Get plenty of sleep tonight in preparation for tomorrow's activities.
Aquarius
Jan 20
- Feb. 18 	
	Sometimes there's nothing you can do about a situation. Get over what you can't change, or your fixation about it will eat you alive. While it isn't like you to give up, you also know when you can't win. This is one those times. Later in the day, an unreliable associate may yet surprise you with a dependable response. Be sure to write it down or no one else will believe you. Tonight, your romantic impulses could trap you in a tight spot -- use the secret exit to escape if necessary.
Pisces
Feb. 19
- March 20
	  	Don't forget that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Yielding to temptation today might lead to a consequence that could have been easily avoided. Be especially conscious about what you eat and drink. Your health has the potential to improve greatly if you are willing to modify your diet. You may find yourself getting tired of those same old tricks your imagination keeps playing. The time has come for everyone to lay all those wild cards on the table."

"event","Yesterday scientists suggested that after considering the results of recent analysis, that revealed the presence of female hormones in beer, men should seriously consider reducing their intake levels.
The theory has been put forward that drinking beer turns men into women. 
To test the theory 100 men were fed half a dozen pints of beer each over a period of 1 hour. It was then observed that all of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing and refused to apologise when wrong.
No further testing is planned."

"event","Star Sign  	Prediction
	  	 
Aries
March 21
- April 19 		Try to keep your eye on the goal as much as possible. Your destination is more important than any distraction that you might encounter along the way. Right now, it's important for you to stay as focused as you can. In business matters, consider only those expenses that are also investments. Time is money, so don't cheat yourself by wasting it. Instead of blurting something out tonight, save your feelings for when you have time to act on them.
Taurus
April 20
- May 20 	  	The gods of money smile upon you. Appreciate your luck for what it is, and enjoy your good fortune. Wealth is a state of mind, and riches will attract riches. Keeping a positive attitude allows you to take chances that you normally wouldn't. Make sure you don't risk any more than you are willing to lose, even with luck on your side. This is a good time to start thinking about ways to help other people who don't have as much as you do.
Gemini
May 21
- June 21 		Obstacles keep coming up today, but it's nothing you can't handle if you keep a positive mental attitude. Being diligent is always a good idea, but there may not be anything you can do to avoid an unexpected outcome. Even if you followed all the developments, the results may still come as a surprise. There is a certain discussion that can no longer be put off. Have the courage to be yourself whether or not it makes you popular.
Cancer
June 22
- July 22 		Get ready for your career or personal life to take off in the next couple of days. You are thrust into a leadership position rather quickly. You find yourself in control of a plan or project that has begun without your noticing it. Gather as many details as possible and you'll be able to hit the ground running. Other people believe very strongly in your abilities, so have a little faith in yourself. Your elegant style impresses an important newcomer.
Leo
July 23
- August 22 		Be very careful not to overstep the boundaries today, or you may put yourself into a difficult situation without even meaning to. Be forewarned: If you strike out in heedlessly or in anger, you may be the one who ends up paying. Channel your rebellious feelings into useful actions. Reaching your goal ahead of schedule could be the sweetest vindication of all. Tonight is a great time to concentrate on personal communications. Write a letter or make a long-distance phone call.
Virgo
August 23
- Sept. 22 		You feel a sense of peace rush over you. You are like a rolling stone, moving from point to point along the path of least resistance. Your general sense of well-being leaves you open to new ideas and customs. Philosophy comes easily today. Joining in group activities and discussions gets you in tune with how you really feel about yourself. Changing your life's priorities is as simple or as difficult as you make it.
Libra
Sept. 23
- Oct. 22 		You are called upon to act as peacemaker. It's up to you when an angry situation needs to be defused, but make sure you do it without taking sides. Remember that no one is completely in control, not even you. Play on the human element to put the higher issues in perspective. The events of the day make you realize how much your friends and family truly mean to you. Take the time to let them know how you feel.
Scorpio
Oct. 23
- Nov. 21 		Make sure you know exactly what you want before you ask for it. Any 'Dear Landlord' letter that you write at this time is likely to be answered, but it may not be the answer you want if the questions were fuzzy. Go ahead and tempt fate, but be aware that you could be adding a whole new set of variables to your life. It's a good time to reevaluate the important aspects of your life. Once you realize that your tenancy here is not permanent, you are free to work on what truly matters.
Sagittarius
Nov 22
- Dec. 21 		Sometimes there's just no escape from reality. Spend the majority of the day taking care of your responsibilities. Pay the bills, grease the wheels and extend small courtesies. Make sure you pay attention to the small details rather than the big picture. You'll be glad that you left everything in order when the moment is right to make your break tonight. Having a good time is as easy as letting go of your expectations.
Capricorn
Dec. 22
- Jan. 19 		A positive light surrounds everything you do. Whether working, playing or just keeping the details of your life together, every activity is fun. The stars flood your life with love, adding another dimension of excitement to the day. Tonight, you can respect a closed door even though you know how to charm it open. Take no for an answer this time, but make sure they know you aren't ready to give up on them just yet.
Aquarius
Jan 20
- Feb. 18 	
	Shake off this curiously lethargic mood of yours. Find some way to get your old curious and energetic self up and running again. Get out there and stir up some trouble just to prove to the world that you're still alive. An adventure is waiting for you if you are willing to put in just a little effort. Go out on a limb and invite someone out to dinner or to a movie. Romance could be in the cards if you know how to shuffle them correctly.
Pisces
Feb. 19
- March 20
	  	You may not be able to escape to your usual haunts. Your own personal shelter from the storm turns out to be the most popular place in town. Instead of running away, do your best to smile and join in the group's conversation. Adverse conditions unite everyone in a moment of warm humanity this evening. The better you know someone, the closer you feel. Friends and family members know how to improve your mood."

Radio legend John Peel dead

By Jude Webber and Kate Kelland

LIMA/LONDON (Reuters) - Veteran radio disc jockey John Peel has died of a heart attack on holiday in Peru, his employer the BBC says.

The BBC in London said Peel was on a working holiday in the ancient Inca city of Cuzco with his wife Sheila when he died.

""John Peel was a broadcasting legend. I am deeply saddened by his death,"" said Andy Parfitt, controller of the BBC's flagship pop music station Radio One, on Tuesday.

""John's influence has towered over the development of popular music for nearly four decades and his contribution to modern music and music culture is immeasurable. He will be hugely missed.""

An embassy official in Lima confirmed Peel's death.

""We received a phone call at 4 a.m. from his brother to inform us,"" he told Reuters.

Peel, 65, was one of the country's original pirate radio disc jockeys in the 1960s, broadcasting from ships anchored just outside British waters on shows that won huge followings.

In the late 1970s, he championed punk rock to the consternation of many of his radio contemporaries who were still playing disco and rock supergroups -- and were convinced the new music fad would never catch on.

Peel, who had a trademark blunt style, Liverpool accent and gravelly voice, was an authority on independent music and won an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his work.

He was one of the original DJs on Radio One when it started in 1967. His six-week contract ended up lasting four decades.

Apart from regularly topping music paper Best DJ polls, Peel won the 1993 Sony Award for Broadcaster of the Year and in 1994 was named Godlike Genius by the influential music magazine NME.

In recent years he became well-known to new audiences as the presenter of Home Truths for Radio Four.

BBC Director of Radio and Music Jenny Abramsky described Peel as unique. ""He had a remarkable rapport with all his listeners. Everyone at BBC radio is devastated by the news,"" she said. ""John is simply irreplaceable."""

Started looking properly for a new job to pay off my debts (again) and a venue for my rock club in Belfast and some cd decks and a new guitar and other unnnecessary shite that I'm thinking about at the minute.
Off to College to check a few things out this afternoon and maybe join a couple of courses, in particular a welding course so I can take my professional exam and get that little scrap of paper that says I can do it and a photography course cause I'm not sure if I can do it but want to."

... last time I was there I was completely off my face at an Aphex Twin gig which was excellent and left me wishing I wasn't SO bongoed ... then ended up with two completely bongoed goth women who picked me up outside and took me to marchmont for naughties ... and I passed out for the first time ever (?)... was not amused afterward ... they did give me an optic bottle of rum next day (?) and told me to come back later but I couldn't remember where they lived ... all very surreal.
I am weirdly apprehensive of this weekend coming though, cause I'm really REALLY in need of letting off some steam and being quite ridiculously bongoed and mental and not getting shit from folk.
Well whatever I get up to I am not spending next weekend in Belfast with my family, they are seriously doing my head in, so I may just bump into you in the Burgh."

I thought of dyeing them black but I have enough black clothes ie virtually everything I own so I thought I'll try purple for a change, dark purple of course so they don't look totally wanky.
Someone asked me last night what do I want from a lover/partner .. the obvious answer is sex and companionship ... but on thinking about it ... it becomes way more complicated than that doesn't it ... I kinda see most of my life as a series of adventures with a (too) large proportion of time between spent awaiting the next adventure .. so I suppose what I really want is a lover who I can share my adventures with. I've spent way too much time though over the last ten years waiting around for stuff to just happen .. it's time I took more control of how I spend my time.
My girlfriend is off to her Dad's and we are 'taking a break'... bummer but necessary at this stage. Love her loads already but we've realised that we may want different things at this stage of our relationship ... I dunno it's very complicated ... ah what to do?!?!?
Reckon I'll be in the Burgh for definate next weekend, unless I get waylaid by indonesian pirates or something silly.
Hope you all have a good night tonight at the Mission or wherever...
miss you guys as always.

March 21
- April 19 		The drive for success keeps you moving full speed ahead. Although there may be some roadblocks in your way, you're determined to get past them. You gather strength from all kinds of sources, and you're able to pool them together today so that they work completely in your favor. Other people can be of great assistance to you, but you have to put down your pride long enough to ask them for help. Don't be afraid of looking like you need a hand. They know what you're capable of, and they have complete faith that you'll get to where you want to be eventually -- and so should you.
Taurus
April 20
- May 20 	  	The time is right to begin solidifying your plans. You don't have to know all of the exact details, but gathering the pertinent information and putting it in one place is a good way to start. If you aren't the most organized person, you might want to think about hiring a professional to help you decipher the data you're looking at. Travel agents, CPAs and attorneys can all be of great help to you. When asking for help, however, it's important that you avoid being judgmental or stubborn. Keeping an open mind provides you with the benefit of a different perspective that you need in order to accomplish your goals.
Gemini
May 21
- June 21 		Getting down to business isn't as easy as you'd like it to be, especially if you're waiting on other people's input or actions. Don't let someone else hold all the cards; proceed as much as you can on your own, especially since it's nearly impossible for you to tell what your friends, family members or business associates are thinking. Take the initiative to get the ball rolling, and if you don't get the cooperation you want or need, be ready to get things done all by yourself.
Cancer
June 22
- July 22 		There's an uncomfortable or unpleasant issue lurking just beneath the surface, but you're trying your hardest not to let it out. Don't deal with problems using the direct approach -- in this kind of a situation, let it simmer on a back burner until your intuition gives you a clear directive. Subtlety can be your best friend on a day like today. Feel free to tiptoe around a topic of conversation until you can tell what the other person might be thinking. You're much better off testing the waters with your little toe rather than jumping in headfirst.
Leo
July 23
- August 22 		Getting the things you want is simple: have enough confidence in yourself to know that you can attain them, and know that you deserve to be happy. You can learn a lot by watching other people pursue their dreams, and you have no problem taking instructions from someone who seems to have a firm grip on the task at hand. By listening first and acting later, you get the benefit of experience, and having that extra bit of patience can definitely work to your advantage. Enthusiasm is also a big part of the playing the game today, and you've got enough of it to go the distance.
Virgo
August 23
- Sept. 22 		Hard work pays off when you are willing to put up or shut up. In order to get something, you have to be willing to give something up -- your time, for example -- but once you grasp that concept, the sky is the limit. Try to focus on the most important task first, and then prioritize the remaining things on your to-do list so that you are working in some kind of order. Connecting with new people over an important project is possible, but you have to keep an open mind about their opinions. There's more than one way to approach a problem.
Libra
Sept. 23
- Oct. 22 		Old memories invade your mind, making it nearly impossible for you to do the things you're supposed to be doing in the present. Take some time out of your day to deal with old issues. Talking to someone from your past might give you the closure you need to move on. Weigh all of the potential outcomes first, and then and only then make a heartfelt decision about whether or not you want to rehash the past. If you do decide to make this sentimental journey, try and leave all the emotional baggage that you have behind.
Scorpio
Oct. 23
- Nov. 21 		You clearly see what needs to be done, and you are determined not to let anything get in your way. Your ambitious nature lets you push to the front of the line, and anyone who stands in your way is bound to be sorry. Fortunately you manage to charm everyone around you into compliance. Expect positive feedback from your boss or a similar authority figure, especially if you hand a project in ahead of schedule. And by taking the initiative on new assignments, you not only show that you have confidence in yourself, but also that you aren't afraid to stand up and take charge on an as-needed basis.
Sagittarius
Nov 22
- Dec. 21 		The thoughts and opinions you are capable of expressing right now have the potential to be quite impressive, but it's important to edit yourself just a tad. By sifting through the myriad points in your mind before you actually say anything, you can make sure that your opinions come across in a clear and understandable manner. All things unusual catch your eye and hold your interest, but it's important to remember that not everyone enjoys exploring the extraordinary things that you do today... you wierdo!
Capricorn
Dec. 22
- Jan. 19 		Your datebook is filled, and everything is going according to schedule. You may not have a minute to spare, but you're either at or about to reach maximum productivity. While it's obvious that you're more than capable of getting your own work done, you will still probably get unsolicited invitations from people who want to be of service. There's nothing wrong with dividing up some of the workload, but make sure you keep careful track of who's got what. Even the most simple of tasks runs the risk of becoming complicated if its shuffles into and out of too many (albeit capable) hands.
Aquarius
Jan 20
- Feb. 18 	
	Applying a certain amount of self-discipline is an absolute must if you want to get anything done. You are known for loving your freedom, but you also have a reputation for getting the job done. Make a promise to yourself that you're going to stick with the task at hand, and then dig in. Confusion may be a problem at the outset, but you're much better off getting things started rather than sitting around waiting for an explanation. If no one is around who can help you, proceed with the first step of the procedure.
Pisces
Feb. 19
- March 20
	  	You have friends in all the right places. If you need a job, a favor or even some extra money, you can count on your tight network of friends, family and neighbors to come to your rescue. Of course, there's a lot to be said for doing things yourself, but at least you know that you have people to look to in case of an emergency. You might think that saying 'thank you' isn't enough, but the people who offer you their assistance are happy just to help. Going out of your way to express your gratitude is a nice gesture, but it certainly isn't necessary -- the extent of your gratitude is obvious by the giant smile on your face."

"event","Four occasions have succeed in pissing me the hell off 2nite. wanna hear somethin funny. Qiana had nothin to do with any of em. the first one was work related. 

(1225)I went to this family's house to do an appointment or whatever and they were not there, keep in mind that this is the second time in a row this has happened to me. i think this is what managers were sayin about firmin up my appointments to basically prevent shit like this from happening. And another thign, big ups to my managers. they like really want me to do well and i know this because like every last one of them wants me to be on Key staff which is somethin im really tryin to get right now cause it may end up makin my life a hell of a lot easier. 
(2nd place in pissing me off; if this trend continues with me gettin no shows, itll seriously pose a problem when eagle landing starts asking for rent).

(2108) I have officially made a new enemy. He goes by the name of PJ and hes an RA here in eagle landing. I already have my thoughts about him cause he sounds like a fuckin fag. but today he has given me a reason to dislike his ass. Me and the usual suspects were in the elevator and he speaks to Qiana and Jess and then he says something about somebody being strange. at first i though he was talkin to allen because he dislikes pj more than i do and vice versa. but later i found out he was talkin bout me AND allen and it kinda pissed me off cause like i said, i had no real reason to dislike him before.
(3rd place in pissing me off; if you aint (wo)man enough to say how you feel about me to my face shut the fuck up)

(around 2300) Me and Qiana are watchin the NBA finals on ABC and we gettin all into the game or whatever and allen comes in and tells us that were being too loud. may i just go on a record of saying that you, my friend have been a LOT louder when playin halo during the same time of day. Think about that.
(4th place; dont be a hypocrite) 

(around 2345) Jess is saying that she is worried for reasons i wont go into out of respect. but to make a long story short, their situation may end up getting her and allen into some serious trouble. and me and qiana was sayin that we didnt didnt feel guilty about it and i went the extra mile her they were bascially bringing it on themselves. Both of them knew the rules, and they may have to pay for their mistake in the immediate future. Im aware that allen may lose his room, and empathy you say? didnt i just lose a scholarship bause there was something i was supposed to do but didnt do, so yeah im empathetic alright, just not sympathetic. Basically i know ive said some stuff to you that stung the past couple of days, but A) i didnt what someone said mattered to you like that and B) i was giving you my opinion on the subjectand  if you dont like it, take it with a grain of salt, but dont storm out and basically say I had no right to make an opinion. Im a 20-year-old American damnit, it's my constitutional right to make a damn opinion whether you ask for it or not. You say i disrespected you, but i felt disrespected whe n you told me on the phone that my opinion doesnt matter unless you ask for it. yeah i asked for your advice in relation to my job, but i still respected the fact that you had an opinion (even though i didnt like it). Youre like a lil sister to me and i wanna be there for you and be able to be friends with you. but if you cant respect what i have to say be it good or bad, or whether you asked for it or not, then we really never had a friendship to begin with, now did we?
(1st place; all im sayin is dont dish it out if you cant take it)

Im summary, this week has just been real shitty for me, ive only done like 410 in sales this week, my friends are actin whatever, and chocolate overload ice cream is expensive as fuck in food lion. but ive been invited to the key staff meeting tommorrow, my cousin said she got some people that may want to do some appointments, and florence is gone. so this may be the beginning of a decent week for me

Till next time

"event","Well some things happened this week, some big and some small. I discovered Chocolate overload ice cream, the best ice cream EVER, i finally bought burnout 3 for the xbox at the cost of 12.32 and simpsons road rage, and made a sale worth 410. Me and q almost broke up (again) the other night. for a while she was really making me a lil uneasy with some of the stuff that was coming out about her past. and it made me question, is this something that i want to deal with in the future. But i know she is actually trying to better herself instead of just bitchin about her life and not doing anything about it. so thats why im still giving her another chance. another thing happened this week that shocked the hell outta me. I saw this chick named lisa that i was like inches away from gettin with during my freshman year. Another big thing happened too, one of my managers basically pointed the one simple thing that was keeping from getting recommendations like i wanted, i wasnt looking people square in the eye. i found out that it doesnt make people trust me, rather than make them lose confidence in what im saying. so i will take those as words to live by when i do my appt in like an hour and twenty.

"event","This is basically my breakfast, lunch, and dinner till i start makin money at Vector. I went on field training today and the girl i went with had an appointment in Hope Valley, which is like Durham's equivalent to Southpark in Charlotte. Long story short, price was no object for the lady. She bought like two small sets for her friends and a Galley set for herself. My mouth almost hit the fuckin floor. But i bascially figured out that makin Key Staff is the key to me makin money, cause that means more appointmets for. I think its their dirty little secret cause i saw a guy in my training class who had just made Key Staff with some slips of paper with names of people who had purchased knives and he was setting up appointments based on those. Im only like $1000 in sales away from doin it and i know i can do it my monday if the guy i saw yesterday buys the Homemaker Set and my two appointments tommorrow are successful. I know i couldve easily worked at UPS or somethin this summer, ya gotta understand, im tryin to be a leader out here in this world, and i cant be a leader with the grunt, employee, clock-in-clock-out mentality. This is me tryin to evolve into a better man, so i can make a better livin for myself, and my family when that time comes. I just dont wanna be the nigga askin for spare change and handouts. I wanna be able to show someone else the way one way, and help them accomplish the same mission im tryin to complete. I just wanna relive the days of the last half of my senior year where I was basically on fire, awards here, and recognition there. I wanna feel like that again. This what im goin through now is like bigger than me and Qiana right now. Ima call my cousin and see if she can get in touch with ne one for tonight to make up for my cancellation. 
In other news, my friends Jess and Allen FINALLY got on facebook (which is fuckin awesome), and i had my best Halo match ever with a contribution of 26 kills w/ 2 running riots and killing sprees, which gave us a win of 50-24, so I literally beat that whole team myself, ecven though Allen put up some good #s too with 2 killing sprees and 13 points. Ne ways ill yall know how shit goes as we continue on

"event","Just when you thought i stopped writing, im back with the season primere sort of speak of the soap opera that is my life. Lets talk about Vector for a minute, im not making 300 a week like i thought i was going too and it sorta making me mad cause i see people makin like 2000 in sales they 1st week and it took me two weeks to get my measly 548. and it doesnt help when everyone doesnt support me. One of the admin assissstant at duke (who shall remain nameless) basically told me i was wating my time and told me that the product was crap. dont get mad at the company cause your fat ass cant use a knife. i had some other appointments where i was basically told that i was serving the devil. okay lets get one thing straight, im selling KNIVES people, not weed, not crack. I'm just tryin to make an honest living so i wont have to resort to the latter.
Next up, my business trip home. my grandma juda let  use her car a lot so i could get to my appointments. so u could imagine i was driving home quite a bit. saw some old friends like my cousin Bobby and my friend Ronnie who has now grown to equal me in height, which shocked the hell outta me. I also linked up with Fat Ass (Jayson) and Steve. But who i was really surprised to see was erica, who kinda came and gone throughout the summer because of personal problems. it was good to see her and see that she was doing well. I saw Charlotte as well, but for some reason it didnt feel the same as ther last time i saw her, it was like something was missing, or maybe my feelings for that certain someone are starting to grow. I tried to reconnect with my past girlfriend Danelle but she wasnt home and after 2 days i said fuck it, shes probably in summer school or somethin. I wanted to see my buddy Kat also but i forgot where she lived.
Next, little shit. My computer is back online so i can now whup ass across the globe in Halo again. i can actually go out for a night this week without Q pickin up the check, im closer to gettin money for tuition. and other shit i cant think of just yet

Stay tuned, it's going to be a wild summer

"event",".........I call the head PMS (professor of military science) to try to set up a sales demo for my new job. i then proceed to ask him about my status in rotc, and he basically tells that the cadet retention board said i should be dropped from the program completely. even though he said he tell me at the end of the week or whatever, im worried as hell right now cause that means ill either have to A) pay back all of my scholarship money or B) enlist and end up in Iraq dying for a country that doesnt give a damn about me anyway. I had a pretty good weekend, i finally finished job training and did 2 sales demos, even though they both resulted in no sales. Now this shit is gonna be on my mind all weekend. I even promised Q wed go out tonight, but i dont even feel like going. but i just cant cancel on her because itll be like the 10 th time we had planned to do something and we couldnt do it. I dont want to have to be out of rotc, yeah im not being paid for it, but i got to play paintball for free, essentially see a whole other side to college living by being at duke, be around some interesting people, and basically learn how to be a leader. i just hope whatever happens it wont interupt me going to school because i dont want to be one of those people that had to leave school and never come back to finish.

the saga continues tommorrow

"event","Now with my scholarship gone, i have to pay for school somehow. Luckily, in spite of all the bad shit thats been goin on, i found a job. Basically im selling knives, a crazy belle's best friend (yall know who im talkin bout). Ne ways until thursday at 1000 am i will have nothing to do but collect dust and play xbox all day, which would be better if my intrenet was on so i could whoop ass on xbox live. Between Q bein outta town and Jess being home till summer school starts, im bored as fuck. Although my buddy ChiChi got back way soomer than i expected her to, ive really only known her like a week. I also filled my family in on whats goin on. I love my family because they arent so quick to cut me off just because i fail at something. they give me support and ideas which is what i need at this critical time in my life. Once again im considering the possibilty of transfering because my grandma's friend basically told me that i can get more money and/or scholarship opportunites at other school. when i fill out the fafsa thatll tell me everything i need to know. but at the same, while transfering is a good idea, is it really worth leaving what ive gained here. only time will tell i guess.
      As for the saga that is me and Qiana, im goin through a dillemma. I care about her a lot and she cares about me. sings) ""Why dont we just fall in love."" unfortunately its not as simple as amerie makes it sound. Im young im single and ready to mingle, but its hard for me to spit game at anyone else, because A: i see qiana crying and B: my luck with girls just aint where it was senior year. I done sat up here and let myself actually care for a girl that at first was just using for some ass and to get revenge on a freshman who was too scraed to play the wheel of passion. I dont regret it, but at the same time, i just dont want to fall in love, period. I just wish q would understand that. but as much as i want to i cant have my cake and eat it too. I want to be with Q, but at the same time i want to test the waters. with the summer time right around the corner, its going to be hard as hell resisting temptation, in a sense i can see why q doesnt really trust me. hell, i hardly trust myself sometimes. Im just not ready to be a one-woman man yet, i dont care what the circumstances are. But the question is, is all that really worth possibly losing one of the best friends ive ever had.

"event","Where do I begin. It's official, my baby lost his scholarship and to be perfectly honest. I feel totally helpless. Like for once there's nothing I can do but be there for him and I know deep down that's enough. But I just feel like I should be doing more. Anyway, he's in a state right now and I know he's rather be left alone, but I'm not gonna sit back and let him not do anything to help himself. There is so much more I should be saying. Like this could very well be the end of an era. He has to decide what it is he wants to do. I would love for him to stay, not just for me and the possibility of growth in our relationship, but because I know he is happy here. He has friends that care. He's gaining more confidence in himself and I don't want him to throw it all alway so to speak. I know it would be hard for him to look at the rest of the cadets next year and not be upset, but he's like a giant ball, he always manages to bounce back. And bounce back I know he will. I just read his lj and I kinda feel a lil bad. He said my positive thinking blinded him from the truth. Damn. I just wanted to make him feel better, at least hope that he feels a lil better, but now I realize that my positiviteness, is that really a word? is a bunch of bullshit. It doesn't work for shit. I tried, but I failed the lesson is never try. If you watch the Simpson's you'd get that. Well at least now he's out and trying to find a job and stuff. He's being pro-active and I am so proud of him. Yesterday I was completely honest with him. I told him that we was lazy as fuck, but that I wasn't gonna sit around and let him feel sorry for himself and not do anything. He's like, he didn't know if he wanted my help cuz he wanna do all on his own, while I respect that, even the most powerful man in the world has the guy who wipes his ass in the morning. 

So I told him last night when I went upstairs to get Brey's help on my field show, that this was not going to separate us. For once, I feel like we're strong enough to handle it. Boy it sounds like we're in a real relationship. Maybe we should let this break us up. Or maybe that's the medicine talking. I'm getting sick and I REFUSE TO BE SICK. HELL NAW!!!!! That's another paragraph. I had a revalation last night. Shawn wants to do the whole casual sex thing, cuz he's never felt it. I did the whole casual sex thing and enjoyed it, boy this is not helping my cause any, but I digress. I realized that I couldn't do it anymore because, Jamaal offered again last night. Before now, I would say yeah, jump in my car, fly down the road at 80mph go get the dick I finally crave and leave 3 hrs later. Last night was the 1st time I actually had trouble saying yes. So much trouble that I ACTUALLY SAID NO!!! Oh God, what am I turning into. I am not supposed to feel this way about any guy. That's what the problem is. The way I feel about Shawn is effecting the way I used to look at things. It's effecting how I used to do things. I hate feeling this way. Never again in life. I wanna stop, but I guess there are just somethings in life you can't help . . . right . . .  wrong. From now on, I am not going to feel that way anymore. I can't do it. I won't do it. 

Ok that's enough for now.

"event","If you were a street fighter fan you'd understand. anyways, my life has been altered for the negative. my fears were confirmed when col. scott emailed me and told that they had to take away my scholarship. i knew it was going to happen, but Qiana's positive thinking sort of blinded me to the truth . How i fell you ask, like total shit, not crap, shit. its like, i knew what i had to do, but i didnt do it, and now  i have to pay for it, literally. And it sucks even more because my family had such high hopes for me and they gonna look at me totally different now.

Band banquet was this weekend and I escorted Q to it. other than the cold ass food, i had a preet y decent time. i didnt feel as left out as i thought i was. i also made a new buddy thid weekend, one of Q's sorors. Shes cute in a tomboy sort of way but im not really tryin to press up on her because A: Q would go ballistic and B: i heard shes been around. However, if the oppurtunity presents itself, who knows. In other news, two life altering events are going to happen this week, the cadre will decide my fate, and i have to beg the registrars office to give me credit for a class that is on my schedule, but the wrong section, ive been bullshittin all semester so this is basically what i get. I have also came to the realization that i wont graduate on time. even with summer school this summer i still gotta take military history and im not about to take like 20 somethin hours a semester and kill myself just to graduate on time. i just gota stop droppin classes im doing bad in. cause i gotta take them sometime right. so bascially my new standard is 15-17 hours a semester and that should let me graduate in winter 07. hell ill stil be 07, itll just be cold as hell that day instead of the peaceful spring setting people have come to expect about graduation. okay maybe i wasnt so brief but i guess i had mor eon my mind tonight than what i thought."

I guess i dont give tehm enough credit sometimes. I guess they do see me as a man and in the end just want to see that i am happy. In other news my internet is still not working and a technician has still not come over to check my CPU out to see that limewire is gone (stupid anti-piracy). Bascially no more free porn or music for me. I also gotta go to the damn computer lab to write this journal and handle other shit, like finding a job. My baby Q's jury is today and i hope she does well because was just so worried about it last night in the practice room, but i know shell be relieved when its all over. I got money now and thats always a good thing. i can go grocery shopping now and get some food in my room, which will only then go to my belly. i gotta call the bank and cuss them out about mistakenly giving me a $27 NSF fee when i wasnt in the red, which then sent me in the red. so now i gotta ace exams, get a job, and make further sense of my life.

Until then

"event","Welcome to my life. First of all, big ups to my friend Q for turnin me on to this site. Now i got a dump to dump all the shit i feel when the trashcan in my head overflows. Well, where do i begin? It's exam time and evryone is experiencing stress to some degree, including the cucumber kid (as in cool as a...) i got three exams next week and thankfully ROTC doesnt try to mix in with our civilan life and put their exam in the same week. Im also awaiting the cadre's decision on how they gonna handle my pt failure, hopefully i just get suspended and only have to pay room and board, which is manageable. worst case scenario means i gotta pay back all benefits and i basically gotta take a year or two off from school to pay it back. It seems like they want me to stay but they gotta follow regualations. I mean if i dont stay them theres gonna be like two mSIII next year. 
      The interesting part is I have not told my parents yet and i just got word that they bout to move to charleston. it may have been a ploy by my aunt just to get me to call them, but thats just not somethin you mess around with. but the thing is i dont wanna call them without knowin for myself whats goin on cause then theyll think im nonchalant or unfocused or some bull crap like that. but i think i do need to call to get some answers and provide some as well. well im bout to bounce.

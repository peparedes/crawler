I have been in a very thinky mood lately so many questions have popped up in my head!!!!

not being able to sleep gives you lots of time to think and do stuff...

I have been thinking, why is Bach and Beethoven and Chopin and Liszt so good composers?

Are wormholes possible?

can we travel through time, space without breaking the laws of relativity?

Is E=MC2 true, its only a theory, but a good one at that?

What is energy?

Thats about all i can remember at the moment.

I would like to give a big it up for bekky who has a really nice new laptop! Which i saw yesterday!

thats all for now

Jon"

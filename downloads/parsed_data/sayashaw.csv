So bizarre.&nbsp; The toga party was an excellent wrap up type of thing, bringing in the new year in ridiculous clothing is pretty great.&nbsp; <br /><br />'10 should be an interesting year.&nbsp; I don't really know what else to say though I'm kind of drawing a blank on the whole having important things to say in here.&nbsp; Hmmmm....I would like to do more different types of crafting in the next year...I'll have to work on that.</span><br />"

Continue this game by sending it to other people.&nbsp; <lj user=""soft_n_strange"">&nbsp;<lj user=""argentdragon"">&nbsp;<lj user=""dorrian_00"">&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />1. What are your nicknames?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penguin, Prangin, Gracie, I think that's about it...I know, I have great nick names.<br /><br />2. Who do you RL ship the hardest (friends on or offline, relatives, celebrities, JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE REAL)?<br />I&nbsp;don't know...I&nbsp;don't think I know what the RL stands for and thus shall stand here confused like an interweb newb<br /><br />3. What fandom(s) are you most into at the moment?<br />Hm...that's really hard because I like a lot of them, but I haven't like actively participated in a lot of them...Melanie Rawn most assuredly, some Anne Bishop and Jacqueline Carey, right now it's mostly authors...oh wait, JOSS&nbsp;WHEDON&nbsp;IS&nbsp;MY&nbsp;MASTER...that would be accurate...<br /><br />4. How do you smell?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not like cow shit anymore...though perhaps the scent still lingers...I'm always worried about that.&nbsp; My nose was at some point so accustomed to the smell I could never be sure if I smell or not...kind of disturbing.<br /><br />5. What videogames do you wish you owned at the moment?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's see Folklore, because it's awesome.&nbsp; The little mini-game for Ratchet and Clank Future and Monkey Island 1 &amp; 2 because they are LOST!&nbsp; This is the most tragic thing of all time...you should know this.<br /><br />6. If you had to kill someone what would be your background music?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme music to Monkey Island because it would be really easy to laugh maniacally (also anyone I killed wouldn't really be dead because you can't die in Monkey Island)<br /><br />7. Do you trust easily?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; No because I'm not gullible.&nbsp; Yes because I do tend to start out taking what people say at face value...but if you lie...then that stops.<br /><br />8. If the person you secretly like is already taken, what would you do?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally,&nbsp;if the person they are dating is nice, wish them well of it.&nbsp; However, if the&nbsp;person they are dating is&nbsp;underhanded and sneaky then I hope that they realize it and come crying to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />9. Is there anything that has made you unhappy these days?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not particularly.&nbsp; Can't say that there is.&nbsp; Oh not being able to find Patu to give him his arthritis stuff this morning.&nbsp; What the heck cat?<br /><br />10. Do you have a good body-image?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure if this question means am I always ragging on myself about my body image, well no, I'm pleased with where I am...I could stand to lose quite a bit of weight, but i'm in no hurry about it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;bike ride and take long walks, and play frisbee with the dogs (for which my cat gets really angry with me for) but i'm in no hurry to lose weight.&nbsp; It'll come off when it comes off.<br /><br />11. Is being tagged fun?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Totally splendiferous.&nbsp; It makes me feel like people know i'm here.<br /><br />12. What do you want to be when you grow up (current age is of no consequence)?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd love to travel the world being all anthropological and looking at different cultures stories...it'd be cool, maybe i'd wear a hat.<br /><br />13. What have you been seriously addicted to lately?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloading anime on my playstation 3...it's oddly freeing to know that all you have to do is click it and it's YOURS&nbsp;FOREVER.<br /><br />14. What kind of person do you think the person who tagged you is?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Super spiffy of course<br /><br />15. What&rsquo;s the last song that got stuck in your head?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkey Island theme song...doodoodoodoodoodoodoooooo doodoodoodoodoodoo doodoodoodoodoodoodoodoo doo dooodoodoodoodoodoodoodoo<br /><br />16. What&rsquo;s your favorite item of clothing?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will forever be my signature camo jacket with the patches.<br /><br />17. Do you think Rice Crispies are yummy?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rice krispie treats are good...rice krispies on there own are kind of plain though<br /><br />18. What would you do if you see $100 lying on the ground?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could figure out who it belonged to I would give it back...otherwise I would spend it on anime<br /><br />19. What items could you not go without during the day?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pens/pencils/anything to write with.&nbsp; I'm addicted to writing...so I needs have many different writing implements around me at all times.<br /><br />20. What would you rather be doing right now?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm at work, so almost anything.&nbsp; However on top of my list is finishing the movie that I was watching before I left for work"

I&nbsp;haven't read for the pure love of reading in oh so very long.&nbsp; It's nice and rather relaxing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also have finally picked my guitar up again and decided that I&nbsp;obviously need new strings, so that may be a task for tuesday, restring ye old guitar because it needs it badly...perhaps I&nbsp;can convince my father to buy me strings....hmm... Since I&nbsp;do use an awful lot of gas on him.&nbsp; There are many things I&nbsp;am glad I&nbsp;get to do again now that I've graduated.<br /><br />Also my mother is talking about investing money in another house because she wants to buy now while it's cheap and sell post Olympics when everything will basically quadruple in price.&nbsp; She's got her eye on this adorable ancient house out in Blaine.&nbsp; She thinks dad needs a long term project which this would be since there's real potential that it's going to need something like all new plumbing (which my dad is capable of doing) and it also needs to be leveled.&nbsp; It's really cute though, it's got a BALCONY.&nbsp; Which I&nbsp;think is a major selling point.&nbsp; Balconies are awesome. It was built in 1897 which means there is probably government money for anyone willing to restore it to some semblance of historically accurate condition.&nbsp; But that does mean only using certain colors and stuff and there's a lot of paperwork to fill out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I volunteered to live where ever she does decide to buy because you don't want to leave a house empty in this county...Trust me, I&nbsp;spend every Tuesday with kids who have gotten caught (or admitted to) breaking into those houses and throwing parties.&nbsp; Scary stuff man.<br /><br />So, I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;may be done now.&nbsp; It's been a while since I've written such a long journal entry...interesting...perhaps this is something else I&nbsp;shall do now that I have graduated with me BA.&nbsp; I&nbsp;should probably at some point edit my info on this or something...geez.<br /></span><br /><br /><br />"

So the first ficitonal character my mind jumps to would have to be Collan Rosvenir from the Exiles books by Melanie Rawn.&nbsp; He is my biggest fictional character crush and has been for almost&nbsp; more than a decade.&nbsp; I can't really see a downside to it, he's pretty so I get me some eye candy, he's musical so we can work on our harmony and learn songs from each other to while away the hours, and he's a bit of a womanizer, at least early in the book he is.&nbsp; So, all in all, I think he would have to be my choice.&nbsp;"

And for some reason, I can't seem to leave it like that. It's not the blatent angst --I've hardly a problem with spilling angst in my so called hidden journal-- but something in me keeps me from ever leaving it at just a few sentances. Ever. 

Which I do hate at times. This verbosity. How strange, that one so passive can be so vocal. Maybe it's just that I never bother to let it all out. Would my world be better if I screamed-yelled-argued-fought my way through problems?

Or is it better and I just don't realize it. How would I even know?

I am entierly too horny tonight, for reasons that I honestly can't figure out. Gnarr. Probably just as well that no one's online right now, randomly cyber-ravishing people probably isn't the best thing to do, no matter the circumstance. 

In other news, YouTube has entierly too much Snakes on a Plane shtuff. Including the music video from the closing credits -awesome. 'reminds me, I need to go clip the newspaper articles about Snakes on a Plane for my commonplace book. Bittner would be...proud. 

In other other news, I am scared shitless about having to go back to school. I'm doomed. And yes, I say that every year, along with the false bravado that this year I will, of course, do better. Bull. Fucking. Shit. 

That's why thoughtstreaming is fun. Because you can watch moods swing back and forth rediculously fast. In this case, from horny to dark. And yes, dark is a mood, if only because I declare it thusly. 

But school. Woo. I should probably study some of that German shit, especially considering the test is, in fact, on Tuesday. Damnit, damnit, DAMNIT! The resident Sorcy is *not* pleased with herself right now. 

It all goes back to the idea of short term and long term self-perceptions, and, for that matter, friendships. Think sims, actually. Heh, there's what I *should* be doing. I haven't messed with Sarah and Leslie in a *long* time. Poor things aren't even in love anymore, I don't think. But I get along fabulously with most people on the day to day basis and <i>much </i> worse on the long term. Unless it's Veronica, who's reversed from that. A few people at any given time who I get along rediculously well with on both -crushes, if you will. And Katters. I've always gotten along well with her, even if she is being maddening by knowing things that I don't and not telling me. :p

Sims seems like a really good idea right now. Ta then, kids.

Though it occurs to me that, of the things I feel like babbling about, at least one concerns someone who might read this journal, and might not. It's rediculously hard to keep track with you lot. 

So, babbling. Yeah, woo! Really, what I should be doing right now is reading my book -most productive use of my time that *I* can think of. But I want catharsis, I want it now, and I figure the fastest way to get to it is by thoughtstreaming. 

My hair is full of conditioner. I really need to rinse it out better. In my defense, it's really hard to take a shower when you're pretty much too tired to even stand straight. Oh kung-fu, how I've missed you. *winces*  

And sifu had to go and change all the parts of the form around. Bastard. Cruel, evil, sadistic BASTARD! 'sok, I'll figure it out eventually. When I'm not tired. That sounds good. 

I'm not even thoughtstreaming, I'm babbling. Yes, there's a difference. No, I'm not sure what that difference is either. It just is. 

Really, beacause this is so much babbling and because Tho has signed on so I can babble at him anyways, I think that I shall sign off. Tathen!

You know what I hate? Writers. I'm in enough of a mood that I can't even call it self-hate right now...self hate would involve me being one. And I'm *not*

My life is fun, entertaining, a perpetual adventure, and unspeakably sound. There's a line in Rats Saw God -- ""Sky also maintained that all ""true"" writers had had their hearts broken"" That's not quite it, but you can't write if you haven't lived, and there's no life without risk. Just shadows. And hope of a better thing. 

And I don't have that. I have safety, not freedom, and just putting those thoughts to electronic paper helps to clarify a lot of my life. I've always wanted more freedom, it's a reoccuring theme in every poem and thoughtstream I write, visable or not. ""Freedom is a blank peice of paper"" Paraphrasing things I've written from before, woo me. 

I can write thoughtstreams. I can write a stream of conciousness that is as short or as long as you'd like it -all I need to do is connect my mind to my hands. But that's not what I'm talking about. No one buys a thoughtstream, it's much too personal to apply to more then a few people. The world wants what I can't write -stories, essays, and properly done rants, not erratic rambles that jump from tangenet to tangent and never come close to ending where they started. 

And this is going nowhere fast. *deletes...no, shifts. Same difference, really.*

Only people can actually read it over here. 

It's so strange, I'm fighting myself on this one. I...don't fight myself like this. Not on the important things. 

Maybe it's that She's writing, and I'm strong enough to argue. Could we look at it like that? I think so. I think that makes me feel better about it. 

In truth, I've just read a beautiful essay, by someone with a recent heartbreak. Or rather, recent at the point of the writing. And it hurts, looking at it. It's so well written, that it hurts. I don't write like that, and I've always wanted to. I've always wanted to be the one who knew how life worked and could divulge all her secrets to her readers and maybe make their lives better. 

...No, not quite true. I've always wanted to be Myste Lackey. Or not even that, but I've wanted to write something that had the sort of impact on *someone* that she had on me. I want  to save myself. I can't have been the only sixth grader out there who needed fantasy to cope, to figure out who she was and where she belonged in the world. 

Heralds, heh. I haven't been a herald for years. I've grown past the need for a pretty white spirit-horse to talk in my head and a shiny uniform to mark me as a perpetual goody two shoes. But again, I've grown past the <i>need</i>. Sixth grade was when I needed that escape, I was such a wreck that year. I literally have no memories but what I diary'd, and what I wrote down was...not happy. 

Not stable is more like it. Gyuh...those entries...most of what I write doesn't scare me when I read it later. But sometimes I get incredible flashes of clarity, that derail my thoughtstream completley, and other times...I scare myself. There's still a lot of unsorted pain floating around, pain that really just doesn't make sense. 

Bing, there's that clarity again. Back in...october? November? Thereabouts, I had what I can really only describe as a nervous breakdown. I broke. Shattered. I'm completly serious when I call in a thoughtstream, that remains the one time that it's overrun it's banks. And I <i>drowned</i>

During a <i>test</i> of all things. My subconcious picks the *worst* times to ruin me. 

...There's a one eighty. See, this is what I mean about not being able to Write. Maybe it's just the ADD in me, but as far as I can tell, it's impossible for me to stay on the same paragraph for longer then a paragraph. 

And maybe all I need to fix that is to just Try. 

I've seen through my struggles, and my interior optimist appears to own a very large stick. 

...

Jesus, remind me never to piss myself off. o.O 

All for now. G'night kids.

"event","I just put Koob to bed, and sang to him, like I do every once in a while. It was slightly different though since I somehow managed to pick 5 of the songs that mean more to me then anything else in the world. 

Circle Game: THE song sung at Wyo. It is Wyo in song form, it's one of the best evening circle songs, and it's incredibly pretty.
Dona: Doesn't mean to me as much as it could, another Wyo song, and THE prettiest song I know.
Holderkin Sheep Song: A song stolen from Myste Lackey. The lullabye mom always sung to us when we were sick and tierd and it was late.
Good Riddence: By Green Day. This one was giving to me by one of the guys who's ever really meant a lot to me, and I just really like it. 
The Babysitter Song: A THIRD Wyo song (Evening Circle Songs make the best lullabyes) this one is the one Anna always sang to us (My first year, she was the counseler of the other half of the Dup')

I dunno. If you're desperate, ask me sometime and I'll attempt to sing.

"event","Bah on everything. I hate this. I hate this uncertainty, this confusion, this depression. The paranoia of weather or not theres any feeling left and should I even be trying anymore, the guilt of making one of my friends sad, the pain of all those miles and the fact that we're not closer and if we were, then life would be...different. Better perhaps, but who's to say it really would be?

I have so much work that needs to be done today, I need to finish my egg-drop progect, do my Animal Farm essay, do my research project for AD, do that math packet, do my labs...And yet I spend my time dithering, hanging out online reading LJ's and being a dumbass instead of focusing on whats really important in life. But then, when have I ever focused on anything thats important, or even focused in general? I have a terrible focus and it doesn't help that there are so many interesting things and people in the world that I want to deal with or talk to or play with. 

There. Just redrew my focus rune on my hand with sharpie. Not that it helps. Just the oppisite most likely, all that sharpie is going to poison me one of these days. 

I'm worried that I'm not going to make it, that I'm not going to have all A's, B's and C's on this next report card. I have E's in four classes right now, one of them English. 

I'M FAILING ENGLISH FOR GOD'S SAKES!!! When has that EVER happened to me. 

I need to do my Animal Farm Essay and fix that. 

It seems that everyone else I know gets better grades then me, can do better then me. 

Oh shit Kat, stop crying. It's not worth it. 

And now I'm talking to myself again. GODDAMMIT! I'm rapidly reconsidering where this belongs, it started as a thoughtdump, but really, it seems more like something Gabriel should be dealing with. But really, does Gabriel even exist? Does Alis? Rin, Dante, Kawa, Taya, Tsha, Jack, Fool? Do any of them exist? No. Figments of my imagination, creations of a twisted mind. 

I wish I could go back to how things used to be. Back to when I meant it when I said I didn't want any romance in my life. Back to when I wasn't failing school. Back to when I didn't receed into my fantasy world on a regular basis? Yeah. Right. Even before I moved here, before kindergarden I've been having thes dreams, these imaginings. I have memories of being detectives with my favorite doll, creating worlds, planets, places and stories. I've been dreaming ever since I could think, and I really need it to stop. 

Or at least, if I want to get anywhere in my life I need it to stop. College is in three years, if I can even get accepted anywhere. After college, poof, I'm in the real world, and then what? I have no marketable skills, I'm not exceptionally talented in much of anything. Sure, I can write, I can create, I can dream. 

In an increasingly data-based world, where math and science are the skills you need-not english. Not dreams. 

I should work. I need to work. I don't want to stop writing though. 

Bah. This continues to not belong in this journal. Sorcyress is merely a place to hold excess thoughts, an image of the back of my mind.

But in that case, wouldn't that make this perfect? 

Nevermind. It doesn't matter anyway. One more insignificant person in an insignificant world. 

Where are the Vogons already, it'd be so much easier if the place just blew the fuck up.

And yes, thats all this really is. A thoughtdump. 

Current thought to dump: How me and Zaph wound up hitchin a ride together. 

<lj-cut text=""Rock the prologue"">Zaphod Beeblebrox grinned. He had just stolen the coolest ship he had ever seen, for a reason he couldn't quite figure out, and was now cruising through space. ""Hey Trill"" he called to his girlfriend and unofficial assistent, Tricia McMillian, more commenly known as Trillian. ""How's that whole Improbability Drive thing work?""

Trill sighed and walked over to where Zaphod was reclining. ""You or the shipboard computer figure out the probability of an action and then the computer makes it happen somehow. So, if you wanted to know the probability of an large banana suddenly appearing, for example, you just ask the shipboard computer"" She turned to the computer and punched in some numbers on a small keyboard. Zaphod peered at her semi-interested with one head, while the other lolled back and glanced around the bridge. ""and then the computer makes it happen. Of course, something equally improbable has to happen to make it balance out. 

Zaphod sat up suddenly, an odd look on his faces. ""Do you need me to explain it again?"" Trillian asked, a patient look on her face. 

""No, no...I get it. Thats pretty hoopy."" Trillian stared in astonishment, Zaphod had made it a habit to be impossibly stupid at times, and the fact that he understood a concept such as this...

""What do you suppose the odds of that happening were?"" She teased, ruffling the hair on one of his two heads. 

""Pretty high I'd say"" came a new voice from the middle of the bridge, ""Considering I know bricks that are less dense then Zaph."" A teenaged girl pushed herself up off the floor of the ship, and walked over to where Zaphod and Trillian were staring aghast. ""Hey Zaph, how's it hanging?""

""Pretty well, can't really complain about much. I just stole this ship, it's pretty hoopy.""

""Yeah, I can see that. Who's the chick? And who's THAT?"" She pointed at the robot shuffling into the room. 

Zaphod rolled his eyes. ""Thats Marvin. And the girl's Trillian, I micked her up off this little backended planet a couple months ago. We've been hanging together ever since."" the girl nodded, and stuck a hand out to Trill to shake. 

""Hello! I'm Kat. I'm a MOOP!ian by trade, although I was born on this annoying little place called Earth. It blew up, by the way."" The last was said to Zaphod, in an offhandish tone that more or less pointed out that she didn't care.

""IT WHAT?!?!"" Trill shreiked, leaping to her feet. 

""Got blown up by the Vogons. Something about an intersteller bypass or something. I dunno, I was on MOOP! at the time. You an earthling?""

Trill sat back down on the ground with a thump. All she could do was nod. </lj-cut>

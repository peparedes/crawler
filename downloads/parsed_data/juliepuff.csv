"event","Well, I've started work in the enrolments office at Victoria University, a transfer from the switchboard/reception. I'll be here a couple of weeks, but I think it's fantastic working for these guys! My work mates are all YOUNG, no grumpy old ladies! Also, the work is far more stimulating. I'll be here till the end of next week - so it's not very long, but at least I won't get bored. Unfortunately my computer doesn't have access to the internet, so my journal is being neglected - sorry Renee! I'm in a far better mood than I was last week, just shows what a change of environment can do for you!! 

Five weeks to go!! 

My music is not getting much attention...

I am now going to go for a walk and enjoy this delicious heat! It may be cloudy, but still bloody warm! We had 32 degrees last Thursday Renie Poo! and 28 all weekend!! I went swimming twice in the weekend. The water was wonderful! Refreshing, but not icy. You wouldn't recognise Wellington in this weather, and it's meant to last till April! 

I think I'm going to see Finding Neverland tonight! Hope it's good, if not, at least I'll have a couple of hours perving at Johnny Depp. Mmm..."

"event","Sometimes I have to stop and wonder, am I mental? am I stark raving mad? If someone were to analyse me what would they find? Am I normal and simply paranoid, or normal because I'm unhinged? I am a firm believer - or was a firm believer - that you choose what you feel, I mean, if you want to be happy you can be happy, but then, you can't choose what happens to you. Moods will come regardless of what face you put on. You can put on a smile for all the world and take everything in your stride, but you have to deal with everything at some time or other or you'll just pop, explode and splatter all that personal gunk on everyone else. Talking about things before that happens always helps. I hate to sound morbid. I've been on a downer all week, and I don't want to be!! Maybe I've temporarily flipped because I've been far too hyper under all the pressure and stress lately. It is a stressful thing to leave everything you know to start a new life overseas, even when you know it's the right thing for you to do! Tying up the loose ends is never exactly fun. Oh for plain sailing!! I wish I had a PA to follow me around and do everything for me...I don't want to have to do all this document stuff and deal with the British High Commission, which is absolutely the worst form of Bureaucracy I've ever come across. I'm told the Brits are exceedingly good at it. Save me!

On a happier note, I just called up Katherine and she said she's already talked to her godfather Clint whatsisname and we're going to be able to do my demo in a few weeks - late Feb. She said it would be sooner, but he's only got 2 tracks set up and of course he needs all 12. Okay says I. I'm cutting it a bit fine I know, but I'm sure one day of recording will be all I need and then I'll just burn it all onto a pile of CDs. I'm afraid I may not get a copy out to everyone I said I'd give a copy to...maybe I should stick the music on the web..should be no harm in doing that...I think there's a site - www.garageband.com and lots of unsigned musos use it. Then I can just use the hard copies to send to Record Companies. It will happen, I know it will, it's just a matter of time.

London is so full of talent it scares me. However, am feeling a whole lot better right now, after all, the problems I'll face in London are so far away...Yes I can't wait to have tea with you Renee!!"

"event","Well it's Monday morning, and it certainly feels like it! Another long week of work ahead of me. I really shouldn't be complaining however seeing as I get the luxury of sitting on my ass all week. Being a receptionist is very cruisy work. I get a lot of emails done :) . I feel very refreshed after a very relaxing weekend - which I REALLY needed!! I was...uh..quite high strung... That's what happens when you don't get enough sleep! I've been working odd hours to save for my trip to London (6 and a half weeks now!!) and sleep tends to take a back seat. 

I started packing in the weekend - yes, ever so slightly obsessive at this stage, but I'm excited ok? Besides, the stuff I did pack won't be used before I go anyway, may as well minimise the panic I'll feel before I go :) 

I'm really looking forward to making a fresh start overseas. Finally go flatting. Yay.

I don't have the talent or patience for writing wonderful long journal entries, so I'm going to return to tapping away at the keyboard and transfering callers and answering ""Kiaora Victoria University Juliet speaking"" several hundred times a minute.........<<shudder>>"

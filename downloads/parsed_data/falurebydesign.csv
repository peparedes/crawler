BORING! turns out i hate being in the car for that long. then we went to Sara Ds house and did some usual partying. fun fun fun for all... went to Dans house... Tony's brother, then went and slept over Nikkis. after a long day of doing nothing but eat and watch tv nikki chelsea and I went shopping. i got a skirt and some dinner. it was a good time. tonight i plan on not drinking! weird i think so. hhaha but hang out with kristine and megan h... but for now courtney is bout to pick me up in like an hour. then i dont know what.... 

yet another random tangent.
it is getting super difficult to even think about leaving for college. I dont want to grow up and i deffinitly dont think im ready to live on my own. i talk about how much i want it, but i dont think I can. Im not reasposible, i cry about nothing, i cant make myself any type of decent meal, when im sick i need to be babied and am totally unable to make myself better, I also have very little motivation and need someone constantly telling me what to do, i have little idea about whats wrong and right, and i think im gunna get into a lot of trouble being able to do whatever I want all the time. I might even DIE! (gross exageration) I just dont think im ready... for college, to move away from my friends, :( for highschool to be over, no more mommy, new people who i already know i hate, i just dont like change at all."

"event","i hate it when people dont know about stuff but they judge people or things on there lack of knowledge. im not sure that made sense but it does to me. so 2 instances of this happening in my life in the past week. one time the first time it had nothing to do with me but i didnt like it. well this girl from my school who used to get beat up at her foster home ran away and then got put in an ambulence and everyone at school saw. well of course people start talking about it and changing and saying how this girl went crazy and blah blah blah. and changing what happened and saying she kicked the cop in the face and lots of bullshit that made me mad. I just felt so bad for the girl and I wanted to be able to help her so much. 
the second is a certain friend of everyone didnt attend a certain gathering that all of the guest were quite drunk at, and things happened being that all of those people were all drunk and i believe his exact words were ""i semi wished i went, but i knew i would have vomitted all over myself if i saw what was going on"" that just makes me super anrgy! so thats all."

"event","so its back to school. my february break was great to say the least. i hate going back to school. there are so many people who i dont like to be around at all. they just make me mad. lindsay fisher! ahh (i know this is the person i speak of all the time when im talking about who i hate at school, its just like she embodies everything i dont like in people and then tries to tell people what to do) shes just not my friend.
so school is back to normal and its bad.
oh hey and im going to prom! woo me and d-bob are going together. probably. which should be classic, seeing as we've been friends since always. i cant really remember a time when i didnt know dan. i was pretty young when we became friends, its awesome. yeah that was a random tangent. all i can think about is how much i dont want to be in highschool anymore. oh yeha and my graduation party is June 25th all are invited. except for some people who we dont like. its nikki raphy chelsea and my grad party. should be sweet, cant wait. so spring break i hung out with the usual people and alysse, courtney, james, peter, andrew, Benji (hahaha) (bra theif)... so yeah i did alot too much to write about. but good times."

"event","holy crap im so sick of school. i realize thats all my updates are about as of late. but jesus... why is it neccesary to argue about everything. some people just like to cause drama. as well as hurting other peoples feelings. okay so im clearly talking about matt. so yeah whats up with this?:

Matt5008: and i know you would get mad if you heard i did something with another girl
Matt5008: i never thought aobut it b4 till recently and when i add all the things up i realized......and i guess i feel like your just waiting for me to commit into a relationship
Matt5008: because i know you want more
Matt5008: and i know it hurts you

he sure does know a lot about how I feel... doesnt he?

so okay.. all of this came out of no where. i dont know at all what is up with this. i was fine with having things that way they were. i really was. and its like i dont really wanna even be his friend that much"

"event","so ive just been grumpy latley. i hate school so much. some of the people i go to school with are just so annoying. like why does lindsay fisher cry everyday. and why is american idol all people seem to talk about. and whats with mrs dewey and her nonstop complaining, but then when she fucks up its everyone elses fault. and my biggest problem WHY cant i wear my hat? ahhh i seriously dont understand that at all. and everyone including myself is talking about prom... but i have noone to go with and its sad. and not to mention valentines day is saturday and agian i have noone. matt and i planned to do something with chelsea and tristan and matt later told me he made plans to go to this girls birthday party. I understand but its frusterating. ahhhhhh I dont really know why i rely on matt to do things like valentines day with me. i guess i really shouldnt. we arent dating.... no matter.

nikki and i wanted to go to cleveland so bad and i dont think we are gunna end up going. my family is making me mad like everyday. when i say my family i mean my MOM. she is terrible. why? thats all i have to say. she trys to make me mad. its really like her job. yet so unneccasary. omg


so nothing is really go great in my life as of right now. but i dont know, i guess it could be worse.

"event","so this has been an okay weekend. a lot of matt and louise... maybe no a good thing. i juts cant handle too much of her, and especially when matt is with her, he gets annoying too. so yeah but its cool. louise is actually here now and is playing mario party 5 with my brother. so yeah weird weekend... dont really care to go into detail about the weirdness but friday hung out at louises dads... had a puking festival with matt, then we feel asleep together. saturday i was grumpy and sleepy so i did nothing and today hung out with louise and matt agian. later i plan on eating at aladdins with scott. fun fun. then school and work tomorrow.


a side note... 
it may be that i just over react about everything but i fucking hate it when kristine has a boyfriend.. dont get me wrong i like him and i do want her to be happy but she never ever hangs out with me(selfish i know) if shes got a boyfriend.... until he breaks up with her and then of course im there for her. and this has always been the case, ever since she started dating jordan back when i was in like 9th grade. so ive decided not to call her anymore or make an effort to be her friend at all. because it totally seems like she doesnt care if we hang out or are friends. so im just going to give up. it sucks a lot... and im really sad just thinking about it, but thats just how it is... and it pisses me off a lot.. and i wanna chill with her and stuff but its like shes always with him, always on the phone with him, always having a conversation with him on text, or working or sleeping. so she doesnt have time for me or friends at all, and its like she doesnt notice or cares. at all."

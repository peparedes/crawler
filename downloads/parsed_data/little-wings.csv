I am so glad this week is over, it's been a long week.  It's funny how this year can seem to have gone by so fast yet this week draged on forever. Work was pretty boring, just lot of busy work, sitting on my ass at the computer.  I'm gonna get a big butt that way, and we don't want that.  I don't think I could do this kind of work forever.  I want to be moving, I mean I do at times when it gets busy.  But I only work with two other people, and except for the ones I talk to on the phone it's pretty quite and boring.  I want to work around people more.  I'm thinking I'd like to work with children again one of these days like I used to, we'll see.

My tooth just broke down the middle a bit ago and I don't go back to the dentist till week after next.  They sure drag that out I have to have three crowns and two root canals, four visits and they're still working on one tooth.  $2400 dollars, money that I don't have on the freaking dentist. But I want to keep my teeth so I guess it's worth it, just aggrivating. I'm really trying to save some money up right now, and it just ain't happening. oh well. 

But I'm a bit hopeful, I may not lose him after all. We've talked, I know that I've really hurt him but I'm willing to do anything to make it better.  I can't keep playing around with my life, just because I've been unsure in the past, I  now know I'm sure.  I need to get this fixed, so I can start living my life, and be happy and actually do what I want for once, not basing my feelings of what I want to do, on whats going on around me in other peoples lives but my own, so that's what I'm going to do. 

We'll this rains making me sleepy... and my bed looks warm and cozy,and there's a bag full of candy because no kids came by the house because of the rain.. just what i need.. :)
well g'nite. sweet dreams."

"event","I think my head is going to explode.
I really shouldn't let myself get so upset.  It's not that I can help it though. All this is so stressful, I'm about to lose the only person that means anything in this world to me.  I thought I might have a chance to mend what I've done but it doesn't look like it. I'm only human right, I mean we all make mistakes.  I've only asked for a chance.  Maybe I'm doing too much though, I'm being too desperate.  But then I am desperate , I would do anything to keep him.  But it comes to a point when what else is there you can do. He's so far away from me right now, How can anything be fixed or solved that way. Oh well what doe it matter.  I fucked up, now I have to deal with it.  I just dont think I can deal though.  He was the only thing that gave me hope for anything, he made me want to work hard.  Now I really just dont care what happens to my life anymore.  If he's not in it.  It isn't much of a life.
and I must stop now for my head will surely explode."

"event","Well, I didn't think I would be writing in here ever again. Life got busy and complicated and I didn't feel like sharing anymore. Not that I'm not the only one who see's this anyways, nobody is going to stumble upon my words, no one will read them and that is fine.  I can't talk to anyone it seems, so it will be to this screen in front of me. Everything is just too overwhelming for me lately, it's all falling down around me.  And for half the damage I've only myself to blame, because I was blind and stupid and careless because I couldn't accept that someone loved me so much.  If you can't accept yourself, how can you accept others love, how can you believe it too be true what they tell you?  I couldn't do this, and because I couldn't do this I fucked it all up. I believe this to be the worst year of my life, I know it is without a doubt. 

Back in March, my mother, the strongest, bravest, most beautiful woman I have and will ever know past away.  When I tried to imagine my life without her, I just couldn't.  It was unfathomable.  She had had cancer on and off for 8 years and she fought hard and strong till the very end. The pain she felt was clear in her eyes the last few months she was alive and I could only wonder how she kept going on.  It was not a way I liked seeing her, but she had hope she always had hope and faith.  She wanted to see her grandkids grow up and spend time with them, she wanted to see me get married and have children, untill that last month, untill those last days she fought.  I admire her for her strength and her courage and could only hope to be half the person she was someday.  I belive her to be an angel I know this, she glowed even in the hospital being so sick, operations after operations, and chemo she was absolutley beautiful.  No one would ever and could ever believe she was ill because she truly didn't look it, she had a healthy glow and warm smile. All the nurses would say how pretty she was, and she was. I miss my mother more then anything, I always believed she was going to get better, I never gave in never wanted to belive she would go, but she did. And here I thought I couldn't live without her, but you know what I found out I can and I am.  It's hard, somedays so hard,  but knowing that she is no longer suffereing, the terrible, terrible pain she was in, knowing this, I go on.  She is at peace now, in a place far better then here.  And it may sound wierd but that makes me smile, it actually makes me happy.  Not that she's gone, i'd give anything to have her back, but not in the condition she was in. She didn't deserve to suffer the way she did, it doesn't seem fair when she fought so hard and long.  It doesn't make sense, but I guess that's what you get from life, half of my life has not made sense, but I've gone on.  I have no doubts that she is not with me now, I feel her everyday.  There I times when I wish for that one last hug, to tell her I love her, but she knew, and she made sure to let us all know her family and friends that they too where loved.  And her love was an undying love, and unconditional love that will be in my heart forever.  

And with all that said, it doesn't seem right to say anymore at the moment. I'm just so close to losing someone else that I love more then anything in this world. Not by death, but the pain is just as bad if not worse. Someone who understands me like no other, who loved me and thought the world of me and I was so stupid and blind and I didn't realize this.  I beg for the chance to mend this, and know that maybe I shouldn't even be given that chance.  But I can't see life going on with out this person in my life, without the happiness they have brought me more happiness then I ever thought possible, and meaning to my life.  With all that's happened this year, I can't bare to lose him. I fear it may happen. then what will I do, .. it's all a whirlwind, and i just want the calm."

"event","So yeah I'm watching The Goonies right now, I have no idea how many times I've seen this movie but it never gets old ya know?  All those great 80's movies never get old, The Goonies, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful.. what else?  There's so many more I can't think of, and yeah so they may be a bit cheesy, but I don't care they're great and remind me of a simpler time in life. 

 The 80's had great movies, music, tv and toys.. I mean strawberry shortcake was the coolest right? :)
And the music, first radio/tape player I ever had was this little pink one, and I carried it with me everywhere, one the first 80's songs I ever recall hearing I was riding in the car and it was that song ""Puttin on the ritz"".. I can't remember who sang it though.. went something like "" if you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion fits, putting on the ritz"", yeah, I know of all the songs to remember huh? That and my mom's Oliva Newton John record she had and there was some song on there and she say the line ""gag me with a spoon"" ..lol.. funny shit.

So anyways, yeah I'm just trying not to think too much tonite, I mean why ruin a perfectly good night with stupid thoughts anyways. Thoughts about what I should do, thoughts about the future, and how my life is just passing me by.  Don't need any of that, I'll save that for  a weekday.

Oh yeah and Indiana Jones, and of course Back to the Future, and all those corny sci- fi movies, Invaders from Mars, I'd watch it all the time when I was little and it scare the hell outta me but I'd still watch it.  Oh and Rainbow Brite, and my little pony :)  

It's fun to reminise, the beautiful good ol' days of being 7 and not caring.. and wearing my pink lil corduroy pants my mom bought me and sweater vest..hehe.. hey I looked cute at the time I was 7, it was the thing at the time.. I think?  :)    Hey SB liked it, SB was my crush on and off from 2-4 grade. Most would say at the time of being  7/8 years old ya wouldn't know what love is, but when I think back to it, I did.  I still think of him sometimes, I think I did love him, him and his big brown eyes and freckles, and the time he gave me a lil purple ring and told me it was an engagment ring.. : )  He made adolescents alot more interesting, and was a sweet part of my young little life.  I'll always have good memories about that. And about grade school and the friends I made, those where good times indeed.  

I look forward to good times in the future, I hope for them and that they'll be just as memorable.

Well, enough all that for now.  Im gonna finish watching the movie..

hanging my head
over the edge
i think i've see it all

i've see our lives
both intertwined
a ball of confusion 
in my sadistic mind

i'm holding on
but i wont for long
somethings pulling me down

i'm putting my life
out on the line
out on the edge 
i'm almost out of time

a whirlwind of thoughts
races between
my unconciousness
and my reality

i breath it in 
breath out and began
to let myself go
oh if you had only known
that i was so close to the edge

would you have stayed instead?
would you have held me back?
or just stood there and laughed?

as I fall prey
to an emotional grave"

"event","Here I am in my 20's and what kind of life do I have?  If you can even call it that, sadly not much of one.  I want to be doing something, somewhere else, with new people and new things, yet I still want the comforts of here, of home of being in a place I know,.. I guess you can't have both, or can you?  I feel old, and no of course I'm not, and if I feel this way now I can't imagine what I'm going to feel like when I'm actually getting up there.  I guess because I haven't really lived,  I'm alive and breathing but for most of my life, I haven't lived not life to it's fullest anyways. I need to decide what to do and where to go?  

<i> i've never been one to live life carelessly 
i worry to much
begrudging my inner needs
but sometings gotta be done to make it right..</i>

I'd like to have a new life for awhile and live some, have the fun I seemed to have missed out on when I was a teenager.  I could have that, but it would mean leaving here.  But just for awhile. To be with that someone, and experience life on my own instead of under my parents roof.
But how can I leave my mom, who's sick, who thinks she may or could leave this world soon.  I like to be hopeful so I never think of that, why it's too hard.   and to even talk about it seems wrong like talking about it will make it happen.  so I wont.
But it would only be for awhile, I feel like this is something I really need and would be good. yet there's always that. Tell me how I go thousands of miles away knowing that?   It's all too much to think about, I just wish I could make her better and make it happen. Instead of the wait and see what happens, things don't happen if you don't make them happen.  And am I gonna be and old lady with gray hair before anything happens?  It's all just very discouraging, and I wish I knew what to do.  Yet with all this I feel as though somthing good may happen soon, a change..  I hope these feelings reveal themselves soon and are real, at least I'm hopeful or trying to be.

Well now with all that said I think I'll go play me a lil guitar.  

Music, my solitude..."

"event","another day like yesterday
has found me down again
just when it couldn't get any worse
the demons creep back in
and claw their way to the surface
ripping me open at the seams
gushing forth a river of tears
that all but go unseen
another day like yeterday 
and tommorow how will i bear?
the eyes in the mirror 
that stare back in fear
a clenched fist and heavy heart
I want to tear this rage apart 
that griefens me till I no longer 
want to see
the hazy reflection that is my reality
am I in my own world condemed?
for life it seems..
another day like yesterday
has found me here again
and I want to hide away

Today was pretty uneventful : P
Work same ol' shit.. yeah, yeah.

I wish I could play the guitar better, I wish I could remember how to play the piano like I used to. Six years of lessons for what, to go and forget everyting. I still love playing, but as for reading music that was never my thing. And Bach and all them other dead guys, amazing composers.. but just way to complicated, I like simplicity. I mean I love the music but my hands just weren't made to play it.

It was hot here today, bleck.
And yeah, I really don't have much to say.
hi to you that read my journal.

Okay time for a nap ;)"

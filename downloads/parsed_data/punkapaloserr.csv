i'd lyk to say something about a comment a received in my friends only post.. it was pretty immature and i didn't feel lyk wasting my time on it.. so i deleted it.

let me just tell you a bit about my views on life.. starting with..

A) <b>there is no PUNK BIBLE</b> no rules.. no guidelines.. no regulations.. nothing.. 

B) I never once stated throughout this entire journal that i was punk, hippie, ghetto, or goth... not once... who the fuck are you to think i am ""something"" anyways? if you fall against stereotypical labels.. you're right up there with the lamest of them. I'd just lyk to say that I've never claimed to be something i wasn't.. so if u think that i'm a ""poser"" don't waste your typing for a finger cramp.. because frankly.. i don't give a flying fuck what you think i am. this is a computer. these are words. there's not going to be any hurt feelings running through these wires.. so save your shyt for someone who's gonna listen. I may be reacting this time, but I won't be soon.

C) I can wear whatever i want, listen to whatever i want, and act whatever way i want without you judging me. this is a place where i make graphics, not a place where i reach out and look for your opinions on my personality. I don't give a fuck.. that should be enough for you to understand.. and if it's not.. don't bother commenting.. because i won't reply, and you won't get your satisfaction.

D) If you don't lyk me or my journal.. you don't have to participate in it.. nobody is holding a gun to your head so rest assured.



and one more thing.. i need some help.. i can't keep this journal up by myself. I'm looking for maybe one or two <i>talented</i> graphics makers who I can trust to help me.. if you're interested.. IM me kissmyoassoclass so we can talk and i can get some examples of your work.

sowry for this bytchy post, but i was really pissed off...

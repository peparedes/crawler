"event","Tonight was bitter sweet. I finally got some answers to questions i have been asking for a long time, but i have to say it wasn't exactly what i wanted to hear. It's going to be really hard the next coulple of weeks. 5 months isn't something you can just get over, although part of me wishes it was. Its really hard for me to express how im feeling right now, which has to be a first in my life. I cared a lot. I still do. I hurt like crazy, but understand. How can you ever let anyone else care about you if you can't even care about yourself.  It hurts so bad... i keep thinking that its me, i did something wrong, im not good enough. And its a horrible horrible feeling. Its a sickning feeling. I want you to be happy, but i wanted you to be happy with me too. i want to be optomistic but it makes it worse, so many maybes. I still dont understand completely. I want to understand, but you dont even understand. I hurt, alone. My bed is so cold and lonely, and it will be for quite a while. I dont want to sleep, cant sleep, cant lay down, cant think. Wont think. Mixed signals were every where, why didnt i do something before. So insecure, so unsure now just tired. Tired of trying tired of hurting, tired of wanting. enough rambling. I didnt want to lose you, but its never been my choice. And I supose in the end you lost me. 



someone will find me"

"event","Hmmmmm so what's new with me? Well things have progressed quite nicely with the new guy. We're officially together now which I feel great about. He seems like a really great guy and hey if my dog Jake likes him thats got to say something, considering Jake hates everyone but my immediate family. So I may not fall for guys very often.. but when I do I fall hard... He came over twice so far since the beginning of break and it's still not enough! I can't wait till i get back to SD so that i don't have to go days with out seeing him. I enjoy being around him so much. Man this is sounding cheesy... so I'm going to stop with that. Ironically I've actually had to deal with two of my past relationships in addition to starting a new one. I ran into my first guy that i really loved yesterday in a target. It was the first time i saw him in 3 years, but since i broke up with him i have repeatedly thought about him. Our relationship didn't end very well and i never really received any closure from it. In addition to having to deal with my first love... i also had to deal with my last. Again a relationship that ended without closure, well that was until today. I was in a long distance relationship with him for almost 3 years and we were best friends as well as being in a relationship together. I talked to him daily during the relationship... and we talked to each other daily after we broke up. So what was the difference? We still really cared about each other... and in a long distance relationship you don't even have the physical aspects that are normally associated with being in a relationship with someone. Anyways, so i met with him today and we decided it was best that we stopped talking to each other for a while, which makes sense. It's strange though because even though we've been broken up for 3 months it feels like we broke up again today. man i'm really not making any sense... i need to start writing these damn things so late at night. Anyways the main point is that as weird as it feels to not be talking to David anymore it feels great to know that I can put all my energy into this new relationship and i don't have the old relationships holding me back anymore. I want to give so much, share my time, energy and happiness with this new guy. It's a wonderful feeling, i only wish that i could express myself more clearly here in writing."

"event","Wow, so here I am at 2:16 in the morning  sitting  in front  of my  computer trying desperately to think of something interesting to say  for a first entry. After much thought the conclusion  is that my brain stopped forming coherent  thoughts at about  1, who am I kidding...  even when I'm not exhausted I don't make  much sense. Now the logical  response that I would have to someone as  tired as me would be ""Get  to bed dumbass! And sleep!"" but some how the idea of jumping  in cold large bed  by myself is surprisingly unappealing, so I will ramble on like a drunken idiot until i pass out... or i find something more entertaining to do...like  stare at shiny objects. Personally, I would much rather be back home in San Diego spending time  with an amazing guy who I've just only recently gotten  to know.  I had the opportunity to spend the night with him last night, and I didn't want to leave this morning. I can't stop thinking about him now, all I want to do is talk to him and hang out and get to know him better,  I feel like a giddy high school girl with a crush. It's so exciting to be in the initial stages of dating, and its been quite a  while since I've been completely ready for it. I really look forward to seeing where all of this will go, i just wish that I was able to spend more time with him now in the always enjoyable San Diego weather instead of freezing my ass off  alone in nor cal.  Well at least my bed has new flannel sheets to try out... Off to bed with me!"

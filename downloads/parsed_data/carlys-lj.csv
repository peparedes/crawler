WELL.. he goes in, with fatjoe. fatjoe walks out 3 seconds later, because ""they didnt have anything he wanted"". well, me and joe sit in the car for like an hour, then we call andrew, no answer. we call him again and again, no answer. Joe goes in. can find him. he comes out, no andrew. he goes in like 10 mins later, can't find him. then as 2 hours roll around, ME and joe go in, cant find him, walk threw the WHOLE mall; no andrew. we go to the car again, hopeing hes there, ha no. well, we call adam, asking him if hes heard form andrew. he says no, and joe asks him if he has any way for us to get home, so adam says he'll call us back, he has his fiunred frank come get us, STILL not knowing where or what happened to andrew, well. after frink drops me off, i call adam to have him call me when he finds out, and he tells me andrews in jail WOW. lol I knew we had gotten caught. lol. well then i get home STILL in a good mood. i talk to someone, and he gets mad at me for no reason.

"event","So this weekend, I had a lot of fun.
Usually when i'm not home it keeps my mind off of things. Amanda's party was fun. Then I come home and everything just comes to me. Why my life/love lifes the way it is. And I think to myself maybe god intended for me to just wanna give up all the time. I mean theres really no other way to explain it right? Well idk, then I think of the quote. ""I've givin up on love, because loves givin up on me."" =/ I'm absolutly numb to the feeling of how everything has been going for me lately, it's absolutly re-god-damn-diculous."

After being shoved for the fourth time, by an unknown individual on his left, Ben finally put his studies down to yell at the person, not realizing who he was addressing.

""It wouldn't kill you to shove over,"" Ben Harper exclaimed."

You're my one and only. I've thought about you constantly these past few weeks.
I can't seem to get you out of my mind. In fact, all I see is you.
So to make sure you don't look at guys, I've placed a charm upon your eyes.

See for yourself,

"event","i'm very over the whole guy thing. i always pick the idiots and it's getting really old. i love gay guys...why can't straight guys be more like gay guys. they're so much better. especially my danny! all straight guys are the same. they're all out for the same thing. don't try to pretend like you're something you're not. if you want something, don't pretend like you want something else because it confuses the fuck out of me. you don't gotta lie to kick it. don't front. because i wont believe it until i have a reason to and i don't like wasting my time...at all. i get obsessed really easy and it's way not ok. well. i've been having a good time over my weekend and i don't know if i wanna go to school tomorrow because i'm so full of partying. but i want to go because i want to feel productive. i want a good, sesitive, sweet, genuinely nice, determined, thoughtful man who treats me the way i deserve to be treated. one who respects and appreciates me. i don't want a boy who plays games. don't play around with me. i don't just want to be some do-buddy and i don't wanna be playing that stupid phone game. i want to feel comfortable like, i can call him whenever and not have to worry about calling too much because he doesn't call me ever. i want him to call me too. i basically just want someone to want me as much as i want them. i'm too picky though. looks are important though...and it's hard to find hot guys who fit the personality description...well. any of you out there? come get it."

here is the place where my head is spinning. time is beginning to race away. you come to throw me, knock me off my feet...the world goes crashing by again. 
it's an endless circle that's started all over again and i don't mind it. i keep telling myself things and never listening. how can other people listen to me when i can't even hear myself. i'm done being so paranoid and over analyzing everything. on a lighter note, mike and i went up to oc tonight. and we went on the 3 hour tour....to mother fuckin buena park. if i ever get lost around there again, i think i'll blow myself up. 3 hours in buena park, the most awful area ever driving to find a 405 entrance...leading to ANYWHERE. i have a gay boyfriend now to make me feel better about my inability to find straight guys who will sustain something besides consistant booty calls. he's really cute and i think our plan to boost my spirits is working! i'm really getting on top of my school shit now and i'm getting my contract to get a guaranteed spot in davis on monday. fuck yeah. now i just have to bust my ass and go to class.

oh yeah...did i mention that i love being reunited with old friends?"

"event","for all of you who are wondering, the update and current events in my life:
*broke up with the old boyfriend
*had the best summer of my life
*threw some wild parties and got corely punished
*made friends with some long lost friends
*made new friends and decided they were too much drama
*got out of all the drama
*started working at target and then quit one month later
*started my own business
*got close to finishing the harry potter series
*started school at harbor college (which is just like high school but with ashtrays and more black and mexican people)
*made things better with the bruce and alien
*have started looking for a new boyfriend...summer's over kids.
that's the update. nothing too special but it'll do and i found a guy who i'm into but i feel like such a little kid cuz he's way older than me. he's easy to get along with, really hot, and funny. but i just feel really young and that intimidates me because i always feel older and more mature. but i think the fact that i know that i feel young makes me act a lot younger and less mature. i need to do something about that. this week will determine things. i don't want to just be a do buddy. we'll see how things go. i'm kind of anxious. i get infatuated really easily. i'll try not to be..anyway..i've started a new business. i clean houses, so any of you out there interested, hit me up. i've already gotten quite a few clients.  i've been missing a lot of school because i just can't seem to make it there. fuck...i know. well, it should get better. let's hope so."

on a more serious note. i've come to the realization that i hate aileen. i feel as though i have to compete with her for attention and affection from bruce. and i don't like that. she's invading my house and taking it over. i'm blood and it seems like he likes her better. that sucks. he never talks to me anymore and she's beginning to get the ""i'm better than you and i run this spot"" attitude. damn her. i'll make her life miserable if it's the last thing i do...oh yeah. i want to write a letter to bruce letting him know all this. good idea? i need opinions. thanks."

"event","so i figure today is just going to be another normal, boring, shitty day.  i was wrong; just like always. well. good news or bad news first? mm...good news, so that the bad news just sinks in and digs a hole in me.  well, firstly..i fucking passed my english test on black boy with flying colors. i did so well on that shit and i didn't even read the damn book. you know what...i rule. sometimes i just don't know how i do it. well...now it's time for the bad news. definately the part of my day that brought me down to thinking and shit. well. i had trash pick up...again. just for smoking off campus across the street. are you kidding me?! 10 days of picking up shit all over the fuckin place! jesus christ.  i wan't even on school grounds. well, i thought lunch would be chill. just wind down, go have a cigarette. well. all is well until i cruise back on campus in the parking lot and i see this chick. shes all, ""you and i need to have a talk."" and i was just like, fine whatever...normal shit.  well, she gets in my face and just starts going off about me never talking to her boyfriend and shit and i was just like, you know what...i'm sorry. i don't want him. his sister told me that he needed me to call him and so i did. and apparantly she didn't know i called him and she flipped shit. she was like, ""what you called him?!"" and then it happened. she pushed me down and i fell on my ass like a fuckin idiot.  i wasn't expecting it and it was so embarassing. and i just got up and said, ""i can't do shit. i'm on probation. i'm on probation.""  and then the security guard broke it up and i went to pick up trash.  i told her boyfriend's sister what happened and now i'm kinda nervous that she'll tell that chick.  then that chick will wanna beat my ass even more. damn. i'm not scared to fight..not in the least. i've been able to hold my own and i can get down. and i've scrapped quite a few times but i can't now. i'm not bullshitting. i really utterly cant. if i do, i get expelled and arrested. even if i'm just doing it in self defense. so...whatever. i dunno. that's just a downer. plus..this chick can fight. so if she wants so pummel me while i'm just laying there..then fine. but i really can't possibly explain how embarassing it was. jesus christ.  i don't want people to think i'm some pussy. i'm not scared to get down. shit. but it's just an impossibility. i have to be on my best behavior. and it doesn't matter if i'm on campus or off, or if i haven't been to school...it's not shit with the school, it's like with the police and shit. fuck that. oh well...this weekend better be off the chain and i better be able to get shitfaced...that's all i have to say."

"event","ok, whew this is a new, clean entry. anyways back where i left off. mr. buyer won't give us back the car. why? we bought it! unfortunately, mr. buyer got scammed by mr. ass cuz he spent $2500 for nothing. but then why did he? he already knew it was our car to begin with!

so unable to handle this situation, we call the police. the police asks us whats the concern here. we tell him and all the police wants is the regristation form of the car. no prob. we show the paper and the police said dont worry we will take care of everything. the police asks mr. buyer where is the car. he denys to tell them, and a 20 minute ruckus is undergoing. after the long questioning, he finally tells us the car is located at a certain destination. so we go to that certain destination, but the car isn't there! omg, what the hell is this?! so we call the police again and we tell them it was a fraud. they said they will keep a lookout for the car. so we are about to go find mr. buyer again, but then, when we are driving around, we find that the car is next to a resturant, not at the destination he gave us. so we get the car, and we go find him, and tell him to hand over the keys. but then once again, there is another ruckus over the key. finally, after a severe debate, he gives the key. but before going, he calls my mom a bitch...ok..thats a little overboard, but im not exaggerating one part here. why the fuck would i anyways?? he tells us ""you guys think you have the control over the car because you have the ownership?""...DUH! ownership is fuckin everything!! so let me chart down everything.

1.he made my mom's credit look bad.
2.i am not in a good relationship with my friend's dad.
3.my parent arent in a good relationship with them too.
4.there is a chance that mr. buyer, my friend's dad, can go to jail after one more strike. i don't really want that to happen..
5.mr. ass got his ass away, and its him that started all this. damn the dumbass.
6.mr. buyer lost $2500 by mr. ass, but for some reason he blames us.
7.there are other people that want our car also, because they gave mr. ass money and they think it's right for them to keep the car...wtf?!?!?
8.mr. buyer keeps on calling our house, and its kinda giving me the creeps.
9.i hope this situation ain't gonna really interfere in our friendship. i really hope he isn't as upset on this, like the many people fooled by mr. fuckin ass. forgive me for this happening man! i can't do anything about it. shit happens! i guess i'll visit you soon in the states. shoot man.."

"event","today is crazy. it seems always my life is shaped off by drama. for some reason my day is similar to that of a movie climax. like that one time in 8th grade i favoured this chick, but then my friend also adored her. wow. thats nuts. but it seems like today marks it. i will try in my best english to write down my scenario...

yesterday was like any other day. me and my friends were at gpo, and were planning to go to tumon by foot, which we did so. when we got there, we skating for a few good hours and i figured it was getting late. so i called my mom to ask her for a ride. she agrees, and everything apparently seems to be in order. but my ride was my brother, but i didn't spot anything suspicious at the moment. but he immediately tells me there's an emergency. wtf? I hear something about our car getting stolen, which fuckin' shocks me outta my fuckin' mind! Grand Theft Auto?! He tells me he will inform me some details on the drive home.

This might be a little confusing, so try to stay with me. a while ago, my dad bought this new car, the Astro(some of you should be familiar with). he lets his friend borrow his car. let's say, for example, the friend's name is mr. ass. i'll tell you whats been happening.

my dad lends mr. ass his car for a few months. but, mr. ass had some unfortunate business on this island of guam, such as owing some people huge amounts of money, from $5000 to $10000. so he needs to get out of the island before he gets jumped by all the people he ""borrowed"" money from. so he sells our car! for...$2500! he sells it to this person, this person who is my best friend's dad, and lets call this person mr.buyer. ok mr. ass gets his ass-worthy money and gets his ass outta guam and asses out to korea, with the $2500.

Now lets go back to the present. we figure out mr. ass sells our car without our fuckin permission! how assy of him! but wait, that isn't the only bad thing thats been happening!

1.mr.ass and my dad made a agreement that mr. ass can use the car if he pays the monthly pay for the car, and he didn't. apparently, the car's ownership is under my mom's name, and mr.ass is making my mom look bad cause he isn't paying the fuckin money! so let me put it in easier words...-mr. ass is making my mom's credit look bad. very bad.

2.i am kind of not in a good relationship with my friend's dad.

2 for now, i will tell you more later. but moving on..

in order to sell the car, mr.ass was supposed to inform us that he will sell it, but why the fuck would we want to do that if he's gonna keep the money? we bought it, fool! so he talks with mr.buyer(my friend's dad). see mr. ass tells mr. buyer that this Astro is under my mom's name, but he really needs the money so he needs to sell it. mr. buyer agrees, without telling us anything...wow..shocking huh? if you don't get it, let me try to put it in a more understanding perspective....

lets say i have a ps2. yay, its so fun! but my friend wants to borrow it. lets say my friend's name is josh. i let josh borrow my one and only ps2. aww isn't that nice? anyways, josh is playing with my ps2. but then josh's friend, gerald wants to buy the ps2 from josh. but wait, that ps2 is my own! but josh likes money better than friendship, and sells the ps2 and moves to another country with the money.
So im just like, where the fuck is my ps2?? gerald's sister tells me he bought it from josh, and im really angry, but i try to keep my temper. i go to gerald, and ask for my ps2 back. but then gerald disagrees. he says why should i give it back to you? its mine, i bought it from josh!..sadness, its mine, not josh's!

do you get it? if you don't, good luck in the real world, cuz thats the best way i can explain it. thats kind of what is happening right now, only in the real perspective, josh is mr. ass, and gerald is mr. buyer. whew damn this is fuckin tiring. hold up lemme take a break.."

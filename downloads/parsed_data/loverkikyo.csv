"event","Love is what i dream of hoping to find myself in
 love is what keep me going in life.
&nbsp;
sometimes i dream of falling 
in love with one special boy 
a boy who would love me for me

dreams of love from another to
feel love send me into a land of hopes that
one day i would find that one true boy

i waited all my life for this
love to feel this love and
on this day where the sun was in the sky
shining so bright my love finally i met
the special boy, i finally know was love is
i finally felt the power of love."

""Never Really Was""

[Talking]
I just need to talk to you for a second,
It won't take me long,
I gotta get this off my chest,
Listen!

I'm really glad that you can take out time,
Cause I got a lot on my mind,
I never thought that you would be the kind,
To do the dirt and hang you head,
Babygirl won't you make me understand, 
Why you would say the things you said to me,
You made me believe we would be forever
But it was all a lie

[Chorus]
If it never really was what you seen in me,
Why did you say you believed in me,
It's all because of you my security,
It's driving me crazy baby,
If it never really was what you had for me,
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me,
If it never really was what you meant for me,
Tell me

Now I know I've asked you time and time again,
Were you sure you didn't want another man,
I would of understood it back then,
But you had to wait until I gave in,
Now I know I've been a sucker for your love,
Baby tell me what the hell was I thinking of,
I should of listened to them when they told me
But I learned the hard way

[Chorus]
If it never really was what you seen in me,
Why did you say you believed in me,
It's all because of you my security,
It's driving me crazy baby,
If it never really was what you had for me,
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me,
If it never really was what you meant for me,
Tell me

Why would you play with my heart,
When I gave it all,
It's tearing me apart girl,
All you had to do is say so,
I would of let you go,
You're making it so hard girl

Why would you play with my heart,
When I gave it all,
It's tearing me apart girl,
All you had to do is say so,
I would of let you go,
You're making it so hard girl

Tell me why, why baby

[Chorus]
If it never really was what you seen in me,
Why did you say you believed in me,
It's all because of you my security,
It's driving me crazy baby,
If it never really was what you had for me,
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me,
If it never really was what you meant for me,
Tell me

[Chorus]
If it never really was what you seen in me,
Why did you say you believed in me,
It's all because of you my security,
It's driving me crazy baby,
If it never really was what you had for me,
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me,
If it never really was what you meant for me,
Tell me

[Chorus (Girl's part)]
If it never really was what you seen in me, 
Why did you say you believed in me,
(I just tried to give you what you needed)
It's all because of you my security,
It's driving me crazy baby,
(Would you just tell me why you lied to me)
If it never really was what you had for me,
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me,
(don't know)
If it never really was what you meant for me,
Tell me

I wanted to know, I love the way you laugh
I want to hold you high, and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
I want to hold you high, and steal your pain.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away.

You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.

The worst is over now, and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, and steal my pain away
There is so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high, and steal your pain.

I love him so much...he treats me like MILK...he SPOILS me!:) which is not why i love him so much. It's because he respects me and loves me for me and only me. He doesnt want me to change in any way shape or form. i also do not want him to change either. he is my knight in shinning armor(but covered in paint!lmao..he is a painter) our lives r gonna be great as soon as we plan alot more. we took a big step last weekend.we got ourselves on a family plan with at&t wireless:) its way cool. so we were excited bout that.

"event","wut a shitty ass day today! i woke up real early but it was a good thing cause muh mom would have been totally late for work. Then i took muh bro to to some service learning and then i took him to get a physical at 1:30 then i went to curves at like 2 but they didnt open until 3 ! so i went to see muh mom at work and asked for some gas money but she said i didnt need any gas yet. so i was like whatever..she told me not to go to curves yet that she would go with me but i came home and fell asleep. apparently when muh mom came home from work she had a really bad migrain and she took a nap too cause when i woke up she was asleep on the couch and muh dad was asleep in his room! LOL it was a shitty day so it all made us tired i guess. i hope he dont rain tommorrow. i got alot of shyt to do.i have to wake up early go to the gym come home take a shower and then im chillin wit miranda and then i gotta do muh homework for class tommorrow night..but i might do that before i get miranda so i can get it outta the way and i dont have to drop her off early:) lalalalla well imma go now..

"event","Well yesterday i started muh Dr Phil diet. Actually on saturday i went to borders bookstore and i bought the weight loss sucess for teens by Jay Mcgraw(Dr Phil'son) this book is awesome! first it works on your thinking and how you percieve yourself..then he works on the weight loss and how you can keep your spirts up and stick with your diet. I keep a journal. Imma lose 15/20 lbs by june 14:) i know i can do it. I have an eating plan and excersise plan all worked out. so that is that. Then, also on saturday i got an e-mail from mark sayin that he is home for the day from the army and he wanted to see me. He came over and we chilled for awhile. we talked about the downfall of our realtionship. He wanted to get back toghether and told me he was jus under alot of stress. I say yea i know but you broke muh heart and i'll be damned if i get it broken agai..especially by you. i actually stood up for myself and told him what I wanted from the realtionship. He said he promised he will make things better. He went back to alabama for the army on sunday. He will be there for atleast a yr..but he gets alot of breaks from his missions. Im glad we r back together but im not gonna get muh hopes up. I do love him...but HE needs to work on OUR realtionship cause i already know what i want and i already put alot of work into it before. So that is that story! Now...i am takin muh license tommorrow at 1:15..muh mommy is takin me. It's the third time...i know i know. i am scared but i have way more confidence in myself about get muh license then i ever did when i took it the first 2 times. I AM GONNA GET IT. i am workin on it hard. I need to get muh license. I am gonna get a nice job and i am also gonna sign up for curves and work out 5 days a week!:) i am gonna keep myself busy and healthy and make money!!:) i am also gonna take another class here at college. iam gonna take a 12 credit course to get muh childcare certificate so i can work in a day care or nursery or whatever. In order to achieve muh goals i need to get muh license. I know when i get it things will start falling in place. I will start making friends and the responsibility will be off da hook:) iam 18 and need to open up muh eyes to the world and go for the gusto! Imma ride until da mutha fuqin wheels fall of!! LMAO:) well imma go now i am at college right now. I'll be on later and maybe if i gorgot anything i'll write more:)

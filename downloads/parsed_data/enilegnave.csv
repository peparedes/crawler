"event","your life is so hard. spend your day locked inside this enormous house, cleaning and cleaning and cleaning. everything must be in order. it is your art. your big clean beautiful house. the envy of the entire neighborhood. barracaded in with your locks and alarms and signs posted reading ""no solicitors"" and ""ADT"" and ""beware of dog""
no one appreciates how hard you work. how much stress is placed upon you. your ungrateful, unloving, unsympathetic family. youre not going to let them walk all over you. 
drive your rav4 to the grocery store, buy that 6 pack of low carb beer that you always get, for some reason, even though youve abandoned the diet. i guess its just the cool thing to drink. dont forget your ultra light cigarettes and some lime tic tacks. talk to the cashier. she likes you. everyone likes you. youre so sweet. no one can detect any insincerity in your tone. 
come home. stare at your aging plumpening reflection in the bathroom mirror. 
pick up the phone and your pot, creep into the basement. you need a break. your lifes so hard.
is kim home? maybe she has time to talk. you can tell her all about your horrible day, as that green low carb bottle floats in front of your face. light some incence. conceal the smell. unsuccessfully.
emerge a while later from the basement, stumble a little, eyes all swollen, face red and puffy, speech slurred. 
your daughters home. little bitch. it feels good to call her that, get her back for all the stress she places upon you. its her fault. its his fault. its everyones fault. your lifes so hard. 
throw a weak punch. lose your balance. never thought shed hit you back...
youre going to kill yourself one of these days. one of these days, you say, youre going to go buy a fucking gun and shoot yourself. is that what you guys want??? you want me to fucking kill myself??? would that make you guys happy???

we bow out heads, in the back of our minds were all thinking ""well... yes...""

tomorrow youll remember a little. youll feel guilty. youll pat her head, tell her you love her, buy her a magazine or a new pair of shoes. itll all be fine. 

you just work so hard. 
light another cigarette.

burn your candle on both ends.



i just hope you disgust yourself as much as you disgust me.

my eyes keep going blurry today for some reason. its not tears or sleepiness, so i cant figure out what the hell is wrong with me.
i know no ones really happy and i shouldnt bitch and no one likes mopey people, but whatever.  
i always manage to say the wrong thing. i mean to say something, to get my message across, and i end up spouting out some stupid bullshit that doesnt matter. i frustrate myself.
but i understand where hes coming from. i wouldnt like me if i knew me. hell, id get the fuck away from me if i ever met me. Understandable. completely. at least we see eye to eye about something.

im afraid this may be a long one. dont say i didnt warn you. its been a long time coming anyway i guess.
hey kids
things have been going ok, i suppose.
thank goodness for heidi and jane. if i were a boat, they would be my anchor and engine. now all i need is a captain, cuz im sure as hell doing a horrible job of steering. ha, metaphors(sp?) are neat. ill lace all my entries with them from now on.
so the guy i really like thinks im a whore. im not saying that his accusation isnt warrented, but still. the first guy i ever go out on a limb and kiss and all that shit is now totally avoiding me and i can barely get a handshake out of him. but i guess a handshake is better than nothing. his hands are soft. what hurts the most is the fact that he thinks im lying when i tell him how much i care about him. oh well. i knew that evenually id fuck things up. i always do. it was too perfect. and you know me, im just a ho. i just run through guys like water. chew 'em up and spit 'em out. that should be my new damn motto. syke!

i used to walk around butler with tia all the time. i kind of miss her. i get sporadic phone calls that last well into the night sometimes, but i havent seen her since 8th grade graduation. she was really mean to me too, but i sorta take shit from people, so i didnt mind. shed look at me and say ""evan, i sometimes cant believe how ugly you are. you are so ugly. you are one of the least attractive people ive ever seen. why am i friends with you?"" i still wonder whether or not she was serious. when you get told someting often enough by different people, youll naturally start to believe it.
my legs really hurt. i hope its growing pains. that would be nice.
i like abby.
there are really tastey cups full of assorted fruit at marsh. i like them alot, but they are $5 so i rarely get them.
tiresa used to always threaten that she would move out when we were little. thats waht she did when she got in big arguments with dad. shed say ""thats what you guys want, isnt it? ill get out of your way. ill move out and never come back."" these rampages were often alcohol induced, but then again, just about everything about triesa is alcohol induced. anyway, now, since shes realized that we all really actually DO want her to move out, now her new thing is ""well ill just get a gun and shoot myself. isnt that what you want? ill go get one right now. would that make you happy?"" 
can you go to hell for thinking bad thoughts? 
in the back of my mind there was a voice going ""yes, actually, that is what i want"". but i know she wont. her threats are bound to be just as hollow as her promises are. oh well.
im eating spaghetti. it tastes really good.
i know im  sounding like the stereotypical(sp?) teenage girl, but oh well. im not really bothered by it anyway. i cant help how i feel, as hard as i may try. i may as well play the part ive been given, rather than try and make myself sound mature and shit, because im certainly not.
i took home the wrong books. i cant do my homework.
kyle is really cool. i am so happy that i know kyle. hes the best guy friend ever, him and nick and dj and korey and justin.
have i not mentioned that i love heidi meyer? heidi meyer is the only friend ive ever had thats stuck around this whole time, even through my phases when i mustve been totally and utterly unbearable. shit, i may be going through one of those phases right now, who the hell am i to say? so we should all raise our glasses to heidi joanne meyer and make a toast. god bless heidi.
i think taylor must be the nicest person ive ever met. i sometimes just step back and stare in amazement and awe. incredible person indeed. im going to write her a letter tomorrow. letters are nice. ive never gotten a letter before, except from my aunt mary. she really likes me because all her daughters died except lori, and she said i remind her of them. creepy. wow, way to wander off of the subject, evan.
someone left me an anonymous commment. wierd. ive been wondering who it is. FESS UP, ANONYMOUS PERSON! I WANT TO THANK YOU. YOU MADE MY EVENING.
ive had a wonderful childhood. i was just looking at some really old pictures. back in the day when BROWN BEAR had long fur. lol.

im taking an awesome painting class at the IAC. the teacher is so cool and so are the people. *might evie actually make a friend or two this summer?* we shall see.

triesa was shitty with me last night. kept calling me ""bitch"" repeatedly, like a 6 year old that just learned the damn word. she feels bad now. also because yesterday she saw me walking down broadripple ave on my way to class and thought i was skipping, so she screamed and cursed at me at the top of her lungs. everyone stared at me.
she took me to trader joes today because she felt guilty. mmm, trader joes... makes everything bad in the world melt away.

rose is leaving ): 

""and as the embers of the summer lose thier breath and dissappear...""

i hope the rest of the summer doesnt suck. but if it does, the intense lovelyness of the first segment more than compensates for any future suckeyness.

bill might take me to chicago later. that would be cool. to see the art museums up there. but we cant take the motorcycle like i wanted to because its broken for good. ):

i love bill alot. he found a fifth of dark eyes vodka in my closet and was completely cool about it. he said ""its perfectly normal. and i wont tell mom."" then he added ""its a good choice, by the way. clear and odorless"". funny, though, it wasnt even mine.

i wish him and triesa would get divorced. i could live with him and justin in a little house and be away from triesa. not likely, hes too idealistic and good.

besides, ""wishful thinking will fuck you over"". but, if that were completely true, id be quite fucked over right now. but im not.

got a job! a great job! taylor i cant possibly thank you enough.

i danced in the rain. we did a rain dance and remained out in the storm until our clothes were completely soaked, then we put on swim suits and continued dancing in the rain.

i didnt drink or smoke. (except for the peru party) i feel like im growing out of it. last night i didnt even have any desire to drink. i think it is proving to be unfulfilling to me. im finding things that are more fulfilling and beautiful that i can enjoy when im not stoned or drunk. strange.

yesterday jane asked me ""if you could have any 3 material possessions what would they be?""

i couldnt even think of an answer.

i thought about it for such a long time. couldnt think of anything. i sometime feel as though we have too much. what the hell is the use of this huge ass house and all this shit in it and these overstuffed closets and piles upon piles  of more shit? 

TVs. ive learned to hate the TV lately. thanks jane and heidi! theyve been watching the ashlee simpson show nonstop. it urked the hell out of me for some reason.

i cleaned my room and put some fresh pictures of venice and buddha and beautiful people up and got rid of the dust and curtians that i hate and things of the sort and finally plugged in the string of lanterns that i got a long time ago and plugged in the fountian that i forgot about and sat in my room happy because i actually was content sitting it it.

daddy and jusin got home! i gave them both the biggest hugs in the universe. they both seemed immensely happy to see me as well. i couldnt wipe the smile off of my face. though i want to get the hell out of indiana as soon as i can, they may be the two reasons i stick around, or at least visit often, from whatever exotic and beautiful and free and easy and simple place that i am destined to live in someday.

thats been one of the only unpleasant things of my summer - the lack of christie. at least ive talked to her. and i have a picture of her and rose, as well as a picture of jane and heidi, framed and sitting on my desk. theyre always with me now.

damn i feel like i sound like a total ditz right now. and i frankly dont really care. im not going to try and make myself sound deep or profound like i used to during my emo phase because i am not. why does everybody always want to drag themselves down and overcomplicate life? 

life is beautiful and beauty is simplicity. 

im still giddy.

i saw the most beautiful boy in the world the other day. he makes me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world. my heart was beating real fast.

rose-hang in there. we really do love you and so does rob. dont be hard on yourself baby. you inspire me so much and make me happy and make me want to be a better person.

jane-thanks for being lazy with me and curing my horrible case of loneliness.

heidi- (im just mentioning your name because i know you like it when people talk about you.)
and because i love you.

i hope this entry made everyone as happy as i am right now. i dent even care if i dont get any comments. i love you guys.

ah its finally over with! thank god, right?

im finna go watch fight club with everyone else or work on my dream catcher or paint or someting.

i dont know. i like not knowing.
perhaps ill take a walk in the rain. its very nice outside.

davids was awesome. i love him so much. it is awesome to have all those older brothers. big bros are the greatest!

do you guys really think the fat 5 takes it ""too far""?
hmm... i dont know. i dont want to repeat roses entry, which was quite eloquently put, i believe. but there is something more than people think. something intangible and strange and beautiful and irreplacable. 
plus we eat alot.

im getting sleepy again.

does anyone want to hang out with me tomorrow?

my brothers friends are here right now. the friends that i actually love (steven david jake). its just like the summer between 7th and 8th grade i hung out with them all the time and didnt really hang out with my girlfriends. it kinda sucked tho because that was my little EMO-im-gonna-wear-gray-all-the-time phase. it was still lovely. plus im kinda sorta warming up to the smellies.

sorry guys, this may end up being a long one. or maybe not. i hate it when i write looong ones. i feel stupid and a little too exposed afterwards. already said too much. oh well.
skipped today. never skipped before. it was ok. i felt bad cuz everyone thought that i just went to marks to eat, but i really didnt. i had money, i could have eaten anywhere. i just had to be back to finish some gay art project and turn in books and say goodbye to vinnie cuz ill never see him again. and i dont know why im fucking always having to defend myself. 
anyways... yeah...
my ID collection is getting quite fat. i like it. yesterday i started getting kinda depressed and i glanced at it and felt better knowing that a fraction of those faces love me. how lovely. not that ill talk to them this summer. i hope i dont end up by myself all summer like i did last summer. last summer was fucking pathetic. waaayyy too much TV. ill go to rivi alot this year instead. honestly, the best thing that happed to me last summer was the stray dog i found, stella. had to get rid of her. that was sad. 
damn, i have so much shit to say but i never know how to word it. damn. im jealous of you guys with your goodatwritingness.
walked home again today carrying a shitload of artwork. i could have gotten a ride but he was taking other people home and i didnt want him to think i was using him. got his number though as well as some others. ill not call any of them. i hate calling people cuz i think they dont want to talk to me. plus i dont really like the phone. i sound stupid on it.
RAMBLE RAMBLE RANT RANT ETC ETC my apologies darlings.

i didnt even have much fun last night. hangovers are even worse when they arent worth it. 
the party would have been awesome if circumstances were different. CIRCUMSTANCES: i am not outgoing or social or beautiful like every one else at that party and it depressed the hell out of me. i dont think the this party was a good night for the fat5. well, rose had fun i think, but rose is rose. it made me feel better that kristen and jane-both gorgeous in my opinion- didnt have such a great night either. 
the pretty boys see the pretty girls as evie sits unnoticed in the sidelines, drunk and high and not at all enjoying it.
and it was fucking wierd that christie and danielle were there. at 8:30 we were playing on the floor with hulk boxing gloves and acting like we were 5 years old, then at 10:00 they were grinding with random beautiful guys on the dancefloor. damn, how trippy was that. i did dance with chris at the end though. it wasnt sexual or anything like that, it was just an insanely nice guy doing an insanely nice thing for a girl who he was was depressed. not only is he pretty and sweet, he is also perceptive. i hope lucy hooks up with him, they are good for eachother.

Q: why were you upset yesterday?
A: lots of things. and now i am humiliated that i acted upset.

Q: why were you upset today?
A: because my mom is a bitch.

Q: why are you failing in your studies?

Q: who is it that you like?
A: none of your buisness. if i told you i would be even more emberassed. you dont know him anyway.

Q: why are you mad at susan?
A: i am not mad at her, i just am fed up with getting hurt.

Q: why are you so quiet?
A: silence=safety. when you never say anything, you never say the wrong thing. besides, there arent many ears poised for listening.

Q: why did you teach whats-her-name jibberish?

i am going to a super-ultra-top-secret party tonight. it will be nice to finally hang out with the people there, though im not sure how i'll be recieved.
ms young informed me that i looked ""terrible"" in friday. QUOTE: ""are you ok, evie? you have dark circles under your eyes and you look really pale. well, you look pale all of the time, but you look especially pale today"" 
damn thanks alot, i sure needed that to make my day even better. oh well, its not like i havent been called ugly before.
by the way, christie, if your bothering to read this, phoenix acting camp is still going on but the teacher i like isnt there, so im not sure whether i want to go or not. well see."

"event","school sucked again, as usual. its getting to a point where i can barely stand it. 
i was still a bit depressed today. i hate beind depressed. i am going to end up like my mom and sit in a basement and drink and smoke and cry and complain on the phone to my friends when i get home from work. i am well on my way, at least the complaining part. i know i complain alot and that im hard to live with so THANKS YOU GUYS, whoevers reading this, for not slapping my, even though i thoroughly deserve to be slapped. in more ways than one...
i went job hunting with jane and kristen after school. that was nice, but i doubt that any of them want me there because i am not what anyone wants. oh well, at least im doing alright with babysitting. and the prostitution, of course...
i went to get tutored for math after that and was stood up. and then, after i wandered around for a while i went home. after i got home, my dumb ass phone all of a sudden started buzzing, telling me i had a message. the message was from jerri, saying that she couldnt come tutor me. the fucking phone didnt notify me of this until 2 hours after the message was left. YOU BASTARD PHONE!
at least i told my mom that i did see jerri and i got the $20. but it wasnt worth it, really. id give $20, probly more, to have a good grade in math and not feel like such a fucking dumbass. i hate not beind able to understand. and barlow doesnt help the matter- the fucking know it all makes me feel even worse. oh well. se la vi.

lifes a bitch and then you die so fuck the world and lets get high!"

"event","i cant stand school anymore. i was so damn depressed today about everything. and i felt like crap yesterday too. i wrote an entry in my livejournal and thought that i accidentally erased it so i rewrote it- which is why i have two entries that are essentially identical. 
i really wanted to stay after school and do something but eveyrone was busy. i stayed after anyway and was about to walk home but abe took me.
i really want to work at scholars inn, but i doubt ill get the job. mmmmm.....pastries....
by the way, HAPPY BIRTHDAY ABBY
i wonder if kristen will be alright. if she goes to juvi, heidi jane and i all need to go so the fat 5 can all be lil criminals together... awwwe how sweet!

"event","im sick today and bored as hell.
i could have probly gone to school if i so desired, but i didnt. HA! sucks for all you kids.
how was that humanities test, bitches? i was asleep.
and now- 4 movies and who knows how many donuts later- i am bored. oh well, if i were at school, i would be bored in art class right now- or lunch- im not sure. id rather be here. 
sooo... what to write...
RIPPLES WAS AWESOME!
damn i wish it could have lasted forever. i agree with something christie mentioned- that being on stage and pretending to be another person is an incredible release. ah, i love it. CHRISTIE you should take classes at phoenix with me. im not sure whether i should or not- susan will probly go. o well, im not going to let her spoil my fun as she has so many times in the past. 
i dont hate susan tho. she apparently thinks i do. like she cares at all, she probly consiters it a burden off of her shoulders. 
and damn the after party was awesome!
i drank and danced and flirted and made an ass of myself shamelessly and dont give a fuck. i want to do it again.
and again and again and again! 
i guess im done. 
still evie still bored still waiting"

first of all, i am amazed that i am actually writing in this again. most likely the last time, im just really bored tonight.
ANYWAY
damn, what an interesting way to fight... im just writing this as an FYI: im not choosing sides. you all are acting like a this is some kind of fucking battle.
ha, somewhat amusing, though i am just a spectator.
i love you all and hope that you dont make me feel obligated to choose sides or something. 
REMEMBER- the fat 5 remains alive and CED as well. ill just remain nuetral and love both sides (oh yeah, im a playa)
see you saturday jane, if you dont hate me for not hating the objects of your hate.
Love you all

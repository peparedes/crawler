"event","helloo, this entry will be half update/ half vent. well, you know when you have a lot of time to yourself i.e being sick at home all week or being home on a yucky saturday . .you just think about things. and i hate thinking about things and since you have nothing to do, you exaggerate things and you have a lot of what if's. people in relationships will probably understand this more than those who aren't, but stay with me here. i'll start thinking about these things and i jump to conclusions, or i'll just create different scenarios in my head that could have gone on, are going on, or will happen. and it drives me crazy! and then i get really fucking pissed off, like how dare he let me think these things! but, it's not his fault entirely. obviously, i have reason enough to begin with to think about them as much as i do but the jumping to conclusions and having bad dreams about them are all on me. but then i think, is it a sign? or is it like intuition.. or am i just being a dumb insecure 16 year old girl. for the most part, i go with the 2nd. but, it still leaves some things unanswered. i'm not trying to be philisophical here, it's just i feel like things are being kept from me, maybe for my own good actually. most people reading this are like wtf is this crazy bitch talking about? well, to tell the truth i don't know either. i just need to write some of these feelings down, so maybe i can better understand them. i think these feelings or thoughts just come automatically with having a long term relationship [year & 5 months to be exact.] and i wonder if he has these thoughts but then i realize he's a guy and they don't think about that too much. and i don't want to give the impression that i'm in a secretive, horrible relationship because i'm not at all. he does things that make me believe that i really am the only one for him. but then, i watch movies and TV and read books where people have 2 sides to them. and that really makes me sad. i don't want to be one of those people who finds out something about their boyfriend/girlfriend that totally blows them away and leaves them feeling cheated or dooped or regretting their relationship. and mine is nowhere near that point. once again, these are all what if's . . and i feel like i've been preparing myself somewhat to hear these things and maybe that's why i dream so much. does anyone feel me on this? :/ like the last thing i want to do is portray my boyfriend as an asshole because he does a lot of great things for me, just there is a lot of what if's. 

well, last night i went out to dinner at fridays with justina, danielle & jon.

on a lighter note, i see abs! i've been doing the britney tape as well as 8 minute abs, so awesome. it actually works. hopefully getting a job @ hollywood tans or my dog's vet clinic. chillen' with puppies could be fun. my averages in history & french must be sky high, no joke. um, going shopping with madre on the 2nd at short hills, YESS!! :D not much has been going on. need to hang out with danielle/ corrin soon! hopefully we'll get drunk this weekend."

"event","i went out to dinner @ the madrid manor with pops and drank two pitchers of sangria last night. he was telling me all these stories of how he used to grow pot in his backyard and the plants would grow to be like 10 ft high and no one knew what it was. he even has pictures, haha. so i'm going to costa rica most likely in january/ february as promised. we talked about moving to a townhouse in a year which i could care less about cause i'll have senior privelage and what not. michael came over after and we watched the blair witch. i would've liked it alot more if i had seen it in theatres when it first came out. that stuff interests me like woah.

also, i think this is amazing. this guy finds out his wife is banging his best man like 2 weeks before their wedding. now this is a BIG wedding. 250,000 dollars, 400 people invited. and ofcourse the bride's dad is paying for all of it. ok so anyway.. he has a detective follow his soon to be wife and the detective takes pictures of her banging his best man as proof. so he goes through with the wedding knowing all of this, and then when it's time for him to make his toast, he announces to their 400 guests that there's something underneath their seats[which isn't unusual, usually it's a thank you card or something] but no, it's a picture of the bride banging the best man. and then the groom is like 'fuck you, fuck you' to his wife and best man, leaves, and gets the marriage annulled the next day. i thought that was so freakin' amazing."

"event","so i'm thinking of dying my hair <b>dark </b> brown like ashlee simpson, but i know i'd want to dye it back blonde for the spring/summer. if i did dye it, i would do it in like october/november so my hair will be longer. it's in that stupid two inches past shoulder-length stage. comment on what you think i should do while i watch jerry mcguire and eat my sno-caps. thx <3 JiLLiaN*"

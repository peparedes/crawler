Wow. Didn't realize that i was that bad. I guess i had it coming.

Anyway, hi! I know it's been a *very* long time since i posted. I'm actually surprised that my account is still around. Who would've thought?

I guess you'll all be wanting to know what the hell is going on over here. Even if you don't, you're still going to find out. In all honesty, there really hasn't been much going on. I graduated last July, have been looking for a job since them, taken up Kuk Sool Won (martial arts) and have turned into a housewife/object of dependancy for the family. It's not bad being a 'housewife' as it gives me something to do but i am annoyed at how dependent my family have become on me. It makes me wonder how they ever managed while i was gone! Che.

So, how have you guys been?"

I'm warning you in advance that this post may not make much sense as i will just possibly ramble on and on. There will be little to no structure or point to this post except to prove to you all that i'm still alive.

I'm sure most of you will be crying by now. ^_^v  

Nothing much has happened recently really. At least, nothing that i want to get into. Things have ""okay"" and i just hope that they stay that way. It won't be long now until it's the end of the current semester and i'll be able to go home and cook again! I love to cook but it's so difficult to cook for just yourself, ya know? 

Anyway, went and had a talk with my dissertation (thesis for you Americans out there!) co-ordinator. It's so nice to be remembered by old teachers and when they see you and ask 'Where have you been?' and 'How was Japan?' it makes you feel all nice and warm inside. But yeah, all should be ok on the dissertation front. I just have to work on it now...and do a bit more research...and choose a title. I know! I know! I should've done that ages ago but for those of you who know me then you'll know that i suck when it comes to choosing tiles and making decisions. Why can't they just give us a title so we can just get on with it? *sigh* I guess that wouldn't help us much in the long run, i suppose. Oh well. I'll be practically living in the library tomorrow doing research and hopefully i'll come up with something. I'm planning on focusing on Japan but i need to do something related to tourism. 

IDEAS ARE WELCOME!"

I've been cheering for He-Man, admiring She-Ra, crying over Transformers (Optimus Prime's death *sniffles*), giggling with the Popples and singing with Rainbow Brite and fighting with Thundercats. 

*These* are quality children's shows that you just don't find anymore. I seriously want to get my hands on He-Man and She-Ra but that won't be for a while. Until then, i'll just make do with what i can get from downloads and from Youtube.

Speaking of Youtube. Here's a little something that i thought you would all like to watch. ^_^

Enjoy.

"event","Ok. Someone or something has it in for me. I don't what i've done (or what i haven't done) but i'm sorry for whatever it is! LET ME SLEEP ALREADY!!! The first time i tried to sleep ended up with me getting out of bed 2 minutes after getting in the damn thing to quickly call my family. I had to tell them that i'd taken out some money and that i sent a parcel their way. I went back to bed after munching on an onigiri (Japanese riceball) and watching an episode of He-Man on Youtube. I have to admit that some of my desire to sleep had ebbed but i thought it would be best to still and try to get some shut-eye as i have a semi-early Japanese class tomorrow. Anyway, as soon as i had closed my eyes there was a knock on my door. To make a long story short Yuri (a Korean friend who had arrived this semester) and one of the dorm staff were going around trying to find out if anyone was cooking. The entire hall was filled with smoke. With me being the good samaritan (and curious bugger) that i am, i help them out. Still don't know where it came from though. I'll ask tomorrow. But yes, after the hubbub i go back to my room, get into bed and try sleep but no matter what i did i COULDN'T!!!! Not only has my desire to actually go to sleep been strangled and and tossed into the sea but the heat and humidity wasn't helping either! Nor was the weird smell from all the smoke. 

But now, here i am, sitting in front of the laptop in my underwear (i'm sure all the guys wanted to know this) with the AC on full blast typing this entry. Will i ever get a decent nights sleep?"

"event","Do you know what's one of the worst things your mom can tell you over the phone? I guess that there are many things really. In theory (at least mine), every human in the world is different and yet similar at the same time. Therefore, people have different yet similar fears. Well guess what? One of mine came true.

My uncle found me a potential husband.

Shocking, isn't it? I have told my parents many *many* times that i have no desire to marry. I'd be more than happy growing old as a lonely spinster. But parents never do listen, do they? Lucky for me my dad turned down the match. The guy wants me to live in Egypt should we get married. I guess it wouldn't be a bad thing but my parents think me incapable if living there for the rest of my supposedly married life. 

While i'm thankful that the marriage was turned down, i learned that my parents will never see me as an adult and that they believe that they have to be there to guide my every step in life. I'm thankful that they brought me into this world, raised me, fed me, clothed me, guided me, shaped me into who i am today but...a little belief in me would do a hell of a lot better. Why can't they let me discover things for myself? Why do they have to do everything for me? Am i really that incapable? I mean, whenever i go to Egypt i never go out by myself. I'm always with a family member who will take me out and about. I'm in a country where i can *speak* and *understand* the language fluently yet i'm unable to do anything for myself. I've been to China and Japan and i had noone but myself to depend on, in all honesty. In China i had no grasp of the language but i made it. I took care of myself. In Japan, i've been here for nearly a year and while i can speak the language somewhat, it's nothing close to my level of Arabic. 

Ugh. I'm rambling. I'm going now."

"event","I know that i said that i would do my best to update regularly. *sighs* So much for that. It`s just that i haven`t been sleeping too well at night so i`ve taken to napping during the day, which is quite nice. However, while that seems to help with the lack-of-sleep problem it brings up another. I`ve become more forgetful and unorganized. Joy. Get rid of one problem and i end up with another. Found a solution though, luckily! I`m glad to say that my planner is helping me out a lot. So far it`s helped me remember important dates like, cancelled classes, due dates for projects etc. but other things like updating livejournal etc. i seem to forget. I`ll have to start keeping memos if i want to get anything done.

I`ve been as bored as hell recently. Nothing much is going on and there`s nothing much to do. I want to sleep my life away but silly uni won`t let me! XD I have one more class before i can do that anyway. *shudders* Kuroda sensei...

Ack! I forgot! I won`t be able to sleep after that either! I have to make my way to a bookstore and by Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami. I have no choice but to buy it if i want to read it in time for the next literature class. Damn Mark. Giving us a list with a mountain of books for us to read. I admit that they`re good and interesting books but so many?! *sighs* I have a ton of other work to do too you know! *mutters* Damn bastard... 

I wonder if i can get out of Kuroda`s class early today? We`re supposed to be working on the powerpoint for our presentation and i`ve finished that. Woot! I`m ahead of the game! Screw you sensei! *dances* I`ve done all my work for you! *dances some more*

Honestly didn't do much today. Did a tarot reading for Natalie as her deck was being ""cryptic"". It was an eerie reading though. After that i watched an episode of Dragonzakura (Japanese drama) which has me wanting to watch more.

NATALIEEEEEEEE!!!!! IF I GIVE YOU A DVD WILL YOU BURN IT FOR ME??????

Had dinner, went back to my room, finished watching the Gokusen anime on youtube and watched dragonzakura afterwards. Evil youtube! It only had up to episode 4! *shakes fist at youtube*"

"event","I said that i would do my best to update regularly so here i am. Went on the history walking trip yesterday, which turned out to be quite fun. This time we went ended up actually going and seeing Glover Garden. Seb had to leave us there as he had to go and do...something! The man is always busy!

Anyway, it was exceptionally beautiful! I went kinda crazy when i saw all the different types of flowers in bloom. XD Their fragrance permeated the air and it was quite heavenly. Most of us bought Koi food and fed not only the Koi but the pigeons too. They would eat straight from your hand! XD Much fun!

Unfortunately, Natalie didn't come and, as usual, Leigh didn't turn up but to be fair, there were a few people who decided not to bother coming. Their loss really.

We had originally started off as a group but people were being lost left and right. I guess it was the lure of shopping in the tourist area. The tortoise shell shop was having a 50% discount on everything. I don't know about everyone but i don't buy that kinda stuff. It's just wrong. 

But yeah, in the end it was me, Melissa, Lynn, Leah, Lorna, Andra and Ryan who stuck together and made our way to Youmesaito. They all bought lunch, ate and then Ryan, Andra and Lynn went off to go yukata shopping for the fireworks today. Melissa needed to go and get things ready for her fiance's arrival. Leah and Lorna went with her. I stayed at Youmesaito waiting for Natalie who had e-mailed me to say that she was on her way. So i waited. Wondered around a bit though. Was in the book shop when i received a call from Natalie asking me where the hell i was. We met and before we to left to eat i bought a kanji book. Natalie reccomended it to me. Swears by it.

We just wandered around for awhile with me showing Natalie some of the sights that she missed and we also checked out some kind of media festival that was in the nearby park. It was ok. The best bit was this section where they had all these pictures with strange things, for lack of a better term. They had thi s creepy music playing the background, which was broken with the sound of a woman screaming and glass smashing at certain intervals. I happen to be a fan of the supernatural. I love parapsychology.

It's official. Japanese women suck. They get scared at the slightest thing. All the constant girly screams and whimperings of ""Kowai!"" made me want to whack them on the head. 

We wandered around a little more before we decided to head back to the dorms to catch dinner. Goddess i was so tired! I was out since before 9 a.m. 'til nearly 8 p.m. I couldn't stay awake for much longer after reaching my room so i just decided to go to bed. Didn't get up until 12 p.m. today. I'm still tired!

That's about it. Later."

"event","Alright, weird title i know but it got your attention, didn't it? Actually, me posting again would get anyone's attention! ^^' Hello my pretties! It's been a while since i last posted, i know that but i'm back and hopefully i'll try and keep posting regularly for a while.

Nothing much has been happening here in Nagasaki except that i almost completely lost the will to go to classes. The only thing making me go is the possibility of me being thrown off the JASIN program. Not that it's a big loss but i have my future to think about.

That is if i have one, no thanks to this uni. 

I am not enjoying this semester at all. Yeah i've met new people, made a couple of new friends (Melissa!!! *huggles*), still with old friends (Natalie!!! *glomps*) and stuck with the same teachers (Mark!!! *shoots him dead*) but i miss last semester. I miss all my wonderful friends (Shane, Hilary, Ro, Kyle, Jim *blush*, Miho, Aya, Mari, Eric, Kenny etc.) and the fun times we used to have. *sighs* 

In all honesty i can't say that this semester has been *totally* crappy. Natalie has been a great friend. Just today we went walking around for a bit, had some ice-cream, played in a park (Swings!), bought the most awesome takoyaki in the world with garlic mayo (*orgasm*) and then came back to the dorms. She's also been helping me out with my Japanese with tutoring lessons. *hugs* What would i do without her? 

Ack! Laundry! *runs*

Back! *pants*

But yes, tomorrow is a history field trip. It should be the walk-around-Nagasaki one which i went on last time. I don't mind going on it again. It was very interesting. Maybe this time i'll remember where the tourist spots actually are! They have some good, but somewhat expensive, souvenirs. I'll do some scouring and see what i can get/afford. It's hard being a Muslim. Yeah yeah i know i'm one of the worst ones out there but the same can't be said about the rest of my family! There are certain things i'm not allowed to buy such as statues of people and animals. Worshipping reasons. 

Quick note to No-chan, Ro-chan and Sam, keep an eye on the post. Surprises coming your way! If anyone wants anything tell me and i'll see what i can do for you. No trouble at all! ^_^ Don't hesitate to ask. Do you hear me Hilary? *grins*

"event","Right. A few days ago i went to the international office to see if could sign up for 2 Japanese lessons. They were (to my surprise) quite impressed with my idea and my drive to study but they weren't sure if it was possible so they called the head of Japanese, Nakaya sensei. He simply said no so the international staff suggested that i talk to Mark. This is where Murphy's law comes into practice. Apparently he wasn't at uni that day and that he may come in tomorrow. I nodded, said thank you and promised then that i would try to see him the next day. 

I did actually find him and have a chat with him. He wasn't sure if i could take two Japanese classes and something like this had never come up before. That's me for you. Shaking up the system and all. But yeah, we made our way to see Ishikawa sensei to ask his permission and he said that they would give me special permission considering my situation (my situation being that i actually want to study, learn new things and get into my fourth year of uni). Then we went to see Nakaya sensei. I swear i do *not* like that man at all. After a semi-long conversation it boiled down to an absolute 'no' with him but he did offer to give me private lessons twice a week.

*FUCK* NO!!!!!! 1) I don't like you dude and 2) you give me the creeps! After the meeting i flat out said all this to Mark. He didn't seem surprised.

So. It seems like that i have to make a choice between intermdiate and upper-intermediate. I actually sat down and thought about it and i have decided that i will take upper-intermediate but to do that i need to see a teacher about moving up. So i went to see the new teacher (who could help me move up) Haruguchi sensei. He's a great guy. I had a class with him and he's very helpful, smart and (apparently he graduated from Waseda university, which is one of the best from what i hear) and makes his lessons fun. He's not bad looking either! ^_^v

We had a chat and he said that he would have a talk with Jung sensei and see if i would be able to move up. I thought that was reasonable and now all i have to do is e-mail him my e-mail address so he can send me a reply. If i don't get a reply then i should go to his office on Monday. Here's hoping!

Now all that's left is for me to decide what classes i'm going to take. I have to hand in my class registration card by Tuesday 13:10 at the latest. Why so specific? I don't know..."

"event","Had my first lot of classes. They weren't too bad. The new culture class with Marra was quite interesting. I think i'm going to enjoy being in that one but i think i would enjoy it more if my ""friend"" would stop being a know-it-all and constantly talking. 

Said ""friend"" was also being quite a dick towards me. Constantly putting down my intelligence and abilities. For example, saying i know nothing, commenting about what skills and abilities that i have are useless etc. It's gotten to the point where i am now *fed up*! I am seriously cracking and if this keeps up i am going to explode and i don't think i've ever reached that point. I've known said ""friend"" for around 3 years now so you can tell that i'm quite patient with people. If i'm starting to crack *now* then you know that i'm reaching my limit.

Japanese class wasn't too bad. We're working from a new book and it seems ok. Still going over stuff that we've learned. Woot...

Tomorrow i'll be trying out the Nihongo 2 class, see if i can manage it. Here's hoping. I know that it will be much more difficult but if it will help me learn what i need then i can't complain. In fact, i'll actually be happy about a Japanese class here in Gaidai, which would be a first.

Yup! ^__^

After an incredibly long absence (for which i apologise) i thought i would take this opportunity (the opportunity being procrastination) to post on my journal.

Right. I'm not going to make this too long or detailed, or i'll at least try not to.

Uni started on March 30th. I met all the new students including one in particular. Melissa! After all our messaging we finally met face to face. Woot! All the new and old students introduced themselves and what not. The old students were free to leave while the new ones had to stay and suffer through Mark's orientation speeches. 

When all that was done i took Melissa down to the dorms and showed her around while explaining everything that she needed/had to know.

Melissa's a cool gal. I like her loads! She's fitting in really well with the girls her at the dorm. She's made quite a few Japanese friends already. Respect points for her have gone up since she 1)helped me tickle Natalie and 2) suggest that we all bring out our chairs, roll down the hall, get into the lift *with* the chairs while still sitting on them (how we managed to fit 3 people and 3 chairs i still don't know), roll out of the lift, roll down the hall to the vending machine room, get some food and drink, roll back to the lifts, get in one and make our way up to our floor where we claimed the area in front of the lifts as our new 'gaijin' lounge.

Tons of fun! The look on the dorm staff's faces...

Last day of orientation is tomorrow for the newbs but i have to make my way up the hill *shock horror* so that i can buy my textbooks.

That reminds me. I HATE THIS FUCKING UNIVERSITY SO FUCKING MUCH IT'S NOT EVEN FUCKING FUNNY ANY-FUCKING-MORE!!!!!!!!! They just keep screwing me over and over again! They placed me back into fucking intermediate and i know for a fact that i'm going to be working on the same *SHIT* that i not only did last semester but during my second year of uni! I know for a fact that i did well enough in the placement test to be placed in Nihongo 2, now known as Upper-Intermediate Japanese B. I was told by Mark that the minimum to get into it was 50 and my score was exactly that. I asked my Japanese teacher and i complained to her asking if i could go up a level. She said that she thought that it would be too difficult for me. She then told me that she changed the book for the intermediate class and added a kanji book (when i complained to her that we weren't learning enough kanji) and showed them to me. I swear i developed a tick. The same vocab, the same, grammar and kanji i had already learned... 

How i so wanted to strangle her at that point.

We reached an agreement that i would check out the higher class and if i felt that i could manage it then i can join the class. It's either that or spend another semester going over grammar, vocab, kanji etc. that i already knew.I told my mom about all this and she's just as angry as i am. 

Hell hath no fury such as a woman scorned. 

That's it for today. I'm going to go and write an e-mail to my Japanese teacher in England telling her all that has happened and then i'm going to finish cleaning my room, write some letters for parcels then probably curse a few people."

Natalie had finally moved into the dorms and we had gone out to celebrate by buying booze and food (mainly donuts)and then made our way back to the dorms where we drank said booze, ate said food, watched some movies and ordered a pizza! Yummy! It wasn't until about 01:something in the morning that we decided to call it a night.

Waking up today wasn't so good. My alarm went off telling me to get my ass out of bed so that i could go down and eat the breakfast that i never really wanted but had paid for so i *had* to eat it. However, when i rushed to get out of bed my right knee gave away so i collapsed. I smashed said knee on the floor and couldn't really move. Yay...  I only managed to turn off he alarm by dragging myself towards it and slamming on the button. I then had to stay on the floor, unable to get up and desperate for the bathroom. 

Great start to the day, ne? But wait! There's more! 

When my knee was finally strong enough to support my weight again i got up and felt a stinging pain in my knee. Looking at it it turns out that i had scraped it. Oh joy! That just makes my day better and better! Hobbled to the bathroom then went down to breakfast and the stinging pain only got worse to the point where i was limping for a bit. 

I am *so* not in the best of moods today either. I'm tired, worried to death about my brothers who are ill (The youngest of the two can't handle high temperatures at all. Last time he had one he ended up falling unconscious and convulsing.) and mom who was admitted into hospital recently for some heart tests. She may have Angina or something worse.

Mom says that nothing is going to stop her from living long enough to get my youngest bro to stand on his own two feet and until she sees me again.

I want to go home..."

Anyway, he's living in Egypt with his mom so that's why i don't get to see him much. He's the only one of my bros who doesn't live in England, which majorly sucks (He's one of the top three faves!).

He's going to apply for a tourist visa today and then he'll call/e-mail me to iron out some details.

"event","Hey. Sorry for the lack of updates but i've been lazy and busy. Yes, i am that is somewhat contradicting but meh.

Anyway, i'll start from Saturday as i don't really remember what i did on Friday.

3rd Feb-Went out with Natalie and we did some major shopping. That's pretty much what we did. It's amazing how you can sum up the activities of one day with a few words. It wasn't until later that we received an e-mail from Brett asking us if we wanted to go to Jinya. We thought, ""Why not?"" and made our way there. It wasn't until we reached Sumiyoshi that we received another e-mail from Brett, which made our lives complete: 

""Crazy Don AND Morgan are here...game over man! Game over!""

Does it not make you laugh? Honestly?

But yeah. We hurried and rescued Brett from the clutches of Morgan and Crazy Don. Brett's knights in shining armour we be! Huzzah! We ended up drinking for a while (Damn me for chugging those umeshus!)and i got rather tipsy. Tipsy turned into being drunk when we decided to go to Taito for karaoke and nomihoudai. Damn umeshu! So tasty uet so filled with alcohol...

I spent the night in Brett's apartment. Brett oh-so-kindly forced some water down my throat. Thanks Brett. We watched a couple of movies before we went to bed. I slept in the FREEZER ROOM. DEAR GODDESS IT'S FUCKING COLD!!!!! Woke up the next day to Brett telling me to get up before his host family came and saw me. Fair enough. Got up, grabbed my stuff, said a 'thank you' to Brett and left. Heartbreaking, ne? Not really.

Walked to Sumiyoshi and then caught a taxi 'cause there was no way in hell that i was going to be able to catch a bus. I was still a bit off balance but no hangover!

4th Feb- Technically this should start from when i woke up at Brett's place but...meh. There was no hangover whatsoever (Score!) and i pretty much stayed awake for the rest of the day. Went out shopping again with Natalie. Yesterday we'd gone to Hamanomachi and today we went to Amu Plaza. I spent soooooooo much money on CDs but damn it! They're good CDs! 

We had dinner at Jolly Pasta. Yes Ro, Jolly Pasta. Natalie took some pictures for you. The pasta says 'hello'. My squid in cream sauce was so yummy! The garlic bread was tasty too! I was Happy. Yes, with a capital 'H'. 

We then went to Taito and a played a several rounds of of shooting zombies and Tyco. I love Tyco! I'm getting real good at it now. 

After that i went and bought a couple of donuts to give to Ou Ensei as thanks for changing my nameplate to blue so that i could stay out last night then Natalie and i parted ways. So tragic.

5th Feb- Honestly not much was done today. Went to uni to pay off my fees, stayed in the Gaijin Zoo until Natalie was finished with her exam of the day. When she had finished we left uni and made our way to her place so that we could grab some of her stuff and move it into my room so that she would have less stuff to cart around when she actually moves into the dorms on the 11th. Met the host mom and the sister in law. They seemed nice to me but then again i was a guest, no matter how brief my stay was.

As Natalie and i carted boxes downstairs, there was a guy talking with Mrs Ebinuma. Apparently he was giving then a notice of some sort. Anyway, he noticed us and asked what was going on. Ebinuma-san was kind enough to explain and the guy was even *kinder* by offering to give us a ride back to the dorms! How cool was that? Frith really was looking out for us! After expressing our gratitude we rushed upstairs and grabbed as much of Natalie's stuff as we could, mainly books and took it all downstairs. We then loaded it into the truck and off we went, back to the dorms.

On the way back we had a nice conversation with said dude. Interesting enough. Laid into me a bit when i said that i didn't want to get married but meh.

He dropped us off at the dorms, we unloaded all the stuff and said our thank yous again. Grabbed as much as we could we took it all up to my room and stored it in the corner of storing. They'll be there until the 11th when Natalie moves in. I can't wait! Donuts, pizza, movies and booze galore! Huzzah!

I'm so tired right now so i'm going to go to bed right now. Night."

"event","Dear Goddess it's cold! It been snowing for the past couple of days and it's absolutely freezing! I had my heater on most of the day yesterday and will probably have it on most of the time for the rest of this month. I can imagine my utility bill now...*winces*

Right. Natalie came round to mine yesterday. As you can probably guess we played MASH-O. Allow me to post the results of my future. I'm married to Banri, will have my puce Suszuki Swift, will have 7 kids, will work as a translator earning $150, will be living in Prague, my pet is Morgan (better than Mark or Mawatari!) and my wedding dress will be a rubbish bag. 

Oh joy of joys.

There hasn't been much to do lately. It's been too cold to go out and i can only do so much in my room. On a happier note i finally got round to cleaning! I now have a spick and span room! I was so happy! Even Natalie commented on how tidy it was. Heh heh. I have now moved all my manga into a box under my desk so now i have space to put other more important things (cds and soon-to-come hard disk)on it. I need to see about getting another converter plug. I best check Kojima when it's warmer.

About improving the JASIN course, i spoke to all the teachers, gave them all the information they required, e-mailed my own teacher in England etc. and pretty much did everything that i could. I can only pray something will be done in the next semester. Here's hoping!

It's cold. *shivers*"

"event","I. AM. LIVID. I'm so fucking angry that i am tempted to trash my room and break windows and heaven help him if i *EVER* see Nick right now as he will *not* live to tell the tale.

As you can guess, Nick is the reason why i'm flying off the handle. Earlier, i'd managed to finish the powerpoint for tomorrow's Japanese lesson, send it to Kuwato sensei and then send an e-mail to Lorna and Nick asking them to come into uni as early as possible so that we could quickly go through everything.

I get a reply from Lorna telling me that the earliest bus she can catch is the 8:00 a.m. one. Ok. Fair enough. I understand.

*NICK* however, sends me a reply that made me want to *kill* him. Let me type it up word for word.

""Wait wait wait...so is the things due last thursday amd tomorrow are for group or individual projects?""

See? Apart from being a complete *shithead* he has no sense of grammar either. My reply was as follows. Dear Goddess did i have trouble reigning in my anger.

""Nick! You were there when she handed out the project two Mondays ago. That's also when she put you, me and Lorna together in a group. We even came up with the theme for the bloody thing! It was your fucking idea in fact! Last Thursday's project was an individual one while tomorrow's is the group one! Get it together!""

That's it.

Should, no, *when* i see Nick tomorrow he is *so* going to get a tongue lashing. I will personally see to it. At least Lorna had the decency to come up to me and ask for some work to do on the project and tried to help. Despite that, i *still* pretty much did the entire thing myself. Even my teacher has suspicions about our ""working together"". Pretty much said so in her e-mail.

I'm going to go now, and smoke a couple of cigarettes. Then, i'm going to come back in and do my culture reading for tomorrow.

I just hope i calm down. 

I'm sorry if i offended anyone who isn't Lorna and Nick."

"event","The hand is pretty much healed for those of you that are curious/wondering but there is a giant bruise that i can't help but stare at. It's a giant blue-green one that runs from the bottom of my thumb to just past my wrist. I showed it to Lorna who asked about it and she turned her head away. Pussy. It's just a bruise!

But yeah. Thanks to Nick dumping the homework/questionnaire on me i only got about 2 hours of sleep last night. I had other homework to finish on top of that so i was pretty much up all night.

Got up at five a.m., worked my ass off, had breakfast, worked some more then went up to uni for lessons. I handed in the questionnaire to my teacher who was surprised that i had finished it so early. I just looked at her.

It wasn't rocket science you know!

But yeah, she marked it and asked me to ""make it pretty"". There are times when i actually question myself as to why i decided to study this language. 

I was sitting next to Lorna who had apparently forgotten about said questionnaire and that we had to come up with questions for it. Am i the only one in our group that's going to do any work? I need to correct the questionnaire and hand it out, analyze the data, add my opinions, write the summary/presentation thingy, send it to the teacher so that it can be corrected, do the powerpoint for it and then finally present it on Monday. I have my work cut out for me. I still have the history essay/presentation thing for Seb to get done by Friday, re-record my interviewand write up the summary of it for Thursday, have to do my matsuri presentation today (Tuesday)and do the Japanese homework for Friday. *sighs* I'm just glad that i haven't got anything due in on Wednesday so i can spend time working then.

Oh yeah, before i forget, Nick didn't come to Jap. class today. Caught the wrong bus and ended up in another town somewhere. *prays* Thank you Goddess for this little payback.

Anyway, after Japanese there was culture. I was glad that i had done the reading considering that he bothered to give us a test about it today. Nick was there for culture and he finally *FINALLY* got round to do doing his presentation. Guess what he did it on? Love Hotels. That's right, love hotels. It was quite amusing actually. Especially when Tom kept asking him to go back to the slide that had all the prices on it. Heh heh heh.

Nearly fell asleep during the lesson though and it was when Mark was talking about the reading so i didn't miss anything really. Screech Eric was being a bit of a pain though. Wouldn't keep quiet. Dare i say it, i think he even started to annoy Mark. Lesson ended i left.

Didn't do much else after that. Went to the Gaijin Zoo and sat there for a bit with Natalie and Brett. Natalie, being the wonderful person that she is, decided to go to lessons late as usual. Her lesson started at 13:10, she went went at 14:20 so she pretty much had only about 20 mins left of the lesson. She still gets the credit for actually appearing and attending the rest of said lesson.

I left soon after she did to go back down to the dorms. My stomach had been hurting since yesterday and i've been popping painkillers like they were sweets. Bad, very bad. Got back to my room and decided to have a nap, which i did. I sent Natalie an e-mail telling her that she could come down to mine after she finished lessons if she wanted. Apparently she took me up on that offer 'cause i woke up to the sound of her knocking on my door. Let her in, i tried to get myself to wake up fully, which was a bit of a task considering i was still tired and i wanted to sleep more.

We chatted a bit before i went down to dinner and snuck her some food. Went back up and we spent the rest of the night chatting and doing personality tests on the internet. Found out some interesting stuff too.

Natalie left at around 22:00 so after showing her out, i did the dishes, sat down and did some work before going to bed."

"event","Decided to forgo eating breakfast today, especially after finding out that i had missed it by an hour so i went back to sleep. Woke up thinking it was about 12 but when i looked ta my watch it was 14:10.

Well shit.

Got up, did a few chores, had a bowl of cereal (GODDESS HOW I MISSED IT SO!!!!) and waited for the weekly sunday call from my family. During that time i had our Japanese homework dumped on me by Nick (We're doing the group questionnaire thing and he pretty much left me to do all the questions for it. This was done by c-mail and i called him many a colouful name. I don't know about Lorna. Haven't heard from her although i get the feeling that she might have ""forgotten"" about it.) and agreed with Natalie that i would meet with her at Sumiyoshi later.

Mom called, we talked/yelled for a bit then i left to go to Sumiyoshi. Got there, met Natalie, got screwed over *again* by Mister Donuts because they didn't have any Golden Chocolate doughnuts. Bought a pumpkin muffin instead. It was alright but ended up being too sweet. Will try the cheese muffin next time...maybe. I'm 2 points away from getting a lamp!!!! 

We then went to Taito where we karaoked for 2 and a half hours. We wanted to do more but money was a bit of an issue so we had to stop. We had invited Brett to come with us but he declined as he had karaoked last night and was still sore about yesterday's incident with Hiroki in Jinya. 

Ended up having champon and gyoza for dinner (MAN I LOOOOOVE THE GYOZA!!!) then we went to the seven/eleven for dessert. I ended up getting this strawberry sandwich. Bear with me, it gets better. We sat in the park and devoured our treats. The sandwich was pretty nice. Filled with strawberries, cream and custard. It made for a tasty treat but i ended up regretting eating it later. My stomach was *not* a happy camper.

Walked to the bus stop and caught the bus back to the dorms.

"event","Hello kiddies! Update ahoy! The hand is feeling much better today (thanks to all the ice i smothered it with) hence why i thought i would regale you with all the wonderful things (and molestations) i experienced today!

First of all, like the good Japanese girl that i'm not i woke up at 8 am and had breakfast which consisted of 3 small meatball things, 2.5 chopsticks full of rice, about half a bowl of miso soup and a cup of green tea! Yummy! (It was actually quite filling. I normally can't stand eating breakfast in the morning and today was no exception but i ate it anyway like i always do.)

Made my way back to my rom and spent time on the laptop while e-mailing Natalie asking her if she wanted to have sushi today. She said and came round to the dorms at about 4 something. We sat down and i listened to her pour out her sorrows at losing her best friend Tohru who may be moving from Nagasaki. Poor girl. She's really torn up about it.

We made our way down to Wakitakimaru (sushi place) and decided that we were *not* going to have sushi for dinner as the waiting list seemed to go on forever so we went to Youmesaito (a giant shopping mall) where we bought some incense for Natalie and then went on a search for her incense burner tray thingie, which we didn't find in the end. 

We did receive an e-mail off of Brett asking us if we wanted to go karaokeing. Natalie had been craving to go karaokeing since the last time we went so it was no surprise when she said ""Yes!"" and i was dragged along too. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to go tooo but i got the feeling that even if i hadn't wanted to go Natalie wouldn't have given me the choice.

We ended up having ramen for dinner (I had miso ramen and gyoza as i was pretty much starving at that point. I hadn't had anything to eat since breakfast!) then we walked to Amu Plaza (another shopping mall next to Nagasaki station) to continue the search for Natalie's incense burner tray thingie. Ended up buying a shirt that i'm adoring right now from a shop that Natalie introduced me too. Met a nice Japanese girl who works there and who's been to England before and *knows* where Eastbourne is! Apparently she stayed in West Sussex and i live in East Sussex. Some freaky shit that was, i tell ya. 

Caught the tram back and got to Taito. Met Brett and we karaoked for an hour then we went to Mister Donuts. They fucking screwed me over! I wanted a golden chocolate doughnut and they had one left but the couple in front of us grabbed it before i could. I left the store sulking and having not bought anything while muttering colourful curses and swears and the couple for daring to take *MY* doughnut! It's the only one i'll eat besides angel cream (Which i rarely eat anyway.) as the others tend to feel and taste rather greasy.  

After my little sulk, we went to Jinya. Crazy Don wasn't there (Thank all the Gods, Goddesses Prophets, Deities, Satan and all other Holy and Unholy entities!) and we ended up doing the usual, which was drinking, eating and chatting. I finally met Hiroki (Jinya bar owner) and he came and talked/played with us. Natalie and i ended up being groped repeatedly (Ass and boobs if you must know but i think he took particular delight in kissing me. More than once too. I'm just gald that he didn't shove my face into his like he did to Natalie.)However, all fun and games came to an end when he did this head squeezy thing on Brett's head causing him to get really mad and leave Jinya in a huff.

Natalie and i left a couple of minutes afterwards but we bid Hiroki goodbye and he let us go after a kiss and a farewell Grope. 

Yes the last 'grope' was capitalised for a reason. I'm sure that you're all smart enough to figure out why. 

Natalie and i caught taxis back to our places of residency and that as they is that. 'Til tomorrow."

"event","Ok. This is going to be a short entry. Reasons why will be explained shortly.

Went ice-skating today with Seb, Nick, John, Brett and Lorna. Tons of fun! I wanna go again! The only down side is that i fell a few times and the last time i fell i kinda hurt my hand so...yeah. We went back to Hamanomachi, had lunch (Dear Goddess it was McDonalds. I'm so going to eat sushi tomorrow.)then Seb, the kind and wonderful teacher that he is, gave me a lift back to the dorms as he had to go to the uni.

Got back to the dorms, asked for ice of which they gave me 2 blocks. So for several hours i sat in my room and iced my hand. Dear Goddess it still hurts but at least the swelling has gone down...i think.

Had to eat with my left hand and will have to carry on eating with my left hand until my right starts to feel a bit better. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH MY LEFT HAND!!!! I'M BLOODY RIGHT-HANDED!!!!! The chopsticks were an adventure, i'll tell you that. Had to go get a spoon. That's the only other cutlery available in the dining room.

So yeah. That's all for today. It took me over an hour to get this update typed. *sighs*

Later!"

"event","Dear Goddess i need to get to bed! I'm so friggin' tired that it's not funny. I can hear it calling me now. It beckons. Just like the sirens who lured many a sailor to their deep, watery graves in the unforgiving sea. 

Damn it all! Beds can't talk so why the hell is mine capable of speech?! I know that i'm messed up in the head but this is just ridiculous!

Anyway, today's update. Went to my last day of uni this week. No uni tomorrow because of national testing or something like that. I need to see the notice again. Attempted to eat breakfast but ended up upchucking as my stomach could seriously not handle anything that morning. Damn yaki niku tabehoudai! 

Suffered through *three* hours of business and economics with Umali sensei. I just wanted to take a blunt chopstick (Were they ever *not* blunt?) and slit my wrists with it. Luckily, during business i kept myself busy by filling in these questionnaires that were given to me by the international staff. I had bever been so thankful for being given random crap before. For those of you who know me, i tend to space out/get fully absorbed into what i'm doing at that moment in time so when she calls me to answer a question, i haven't the fuckiest on what's going on. As a result, i end up giving some half-assed answer. Leigh ends up saving me by answering. When she asked him the question i felt like banging my head on the desk. Repeatedly. ""What is quality control?"". Even an alcoholic monkey drugged on cocaine can answer that! Jeezie Creezie! I felt like shooting myself in shame and embarasssment! But yeah, that was business. Economics was better as i was sitting next to Natalie and we kept passing each other messages as we had nothing else to do except actually listen to her, which i kinda did. Then it was lunch of which i did not eat. Was still not hungry.

Japanese was afterwards of which we listened to some of the interviews. One of them was supposed to be mine but because my recording, when played in standard mode, sounds like Chip and Dale noone could really hear or understand much of it so i offered to re-record it. Natalie agreed to it and i feel bad for asking this of her. I owe her a lot. I should buy her a box of choux cream puffs or something.

Had a random bout of depression today too. Leigh's not the only one who gets them. The worst one i had was when i was in uni last year. That wasn't pretty. Anyway, was feeling bored, lonely, ignored and just plain depressed. This was during my free period before sado (tea ceremony). 

By the way, i really like that class. I find it most enjoyable even if it is killer on the legs.

Finally got to make tea in the sado way. Had quite a few sweets too. Two bowls of tea and two lots of sweets. Damn sweets had whetted my appetite (Still hadn't eaten anything yet and we finished class at 6 p.m.! Neither had Natalie for that matter!) so i was feeling a bit peckishwhich turned into full-blown hunger by the time i got to Sumiyoshi. Ended eating curry udon with Natalie. We then went to Taito and played a couple of games. Of course we played our firm favourite, House of the Dead 4. WE BEAT THE GAME! Woot! We're awesome! There were casualties however. The first would be our wallets being significantly thinner. I don't know how much we spent exactly but i do know for sure that we spent less than 2000 yen. I think it was about 1500. Well spent i thought! *grins* Oooh the self-satisfaction! Second was that i got a blister and the skin had ripped off as well so it's stinging quite a bit now. I put a plaster/band aid on it and now it's just a little difficult to type as i can't move my finger like i want to. I also have a sore thumb.

Because of our current zombie obesession, we were late in meeting Brett at Jinya who, funnily enough, was c-mailing/e-mailing us to get our asses to Jinya to save him from the ""crazy guy"" who was trying to hook him up with a 40 year old woman. 

I laughed.

I replied to him and told him that we were on our way (which we were) but we had to check the bus timetable first. He replied with: ""Hurry up for the love of Raptor Jesus!!""

I laughed again.

Got to Jinya, rescued Brett and nearly got sucked in myself (He wouldn't let me just go! he had to ""chat"". Damn Canadian. He really is Canadian. Said so himself.). We sat, drank, ate and chatted. Natalie left and about 10:40 to go catch her bus, which was a shame as about 10-15 mins later, a whole load of choudai students (Both Japanese and gaijin alike) came bumbling into Jinya. I stayed for a bit longer before i had to to go and catch my own bus. Made it back to the  dorm and here i am.

Later. I'm off to my cottony death. I'm actually hoping that i don't die 'cause i'm going ice-skating tomorrow. First time! Wish me luck! 

Later!"

"event","The title is from an amusing story told to me by Natalie. When she was 6, her mother asked her and her sister what they wanted to be when they grow up. Natalie's sister replied by saying that she wanted to study, get into Harvard, become a doctor etc. Good for her. When she asked Natalie however, our little blonde bundle of fun happily stated "" I want to smoke!""

2 days later, her mom quit smoking.

Anyway, sorry about the lack of updating.  

13th Jan- My saturday started off with me getting up, having breakfast, going back to bed, getting up and *FINALLY* getting round to making that cream stew. The veg. was a bit overcooked but over all, it was quite nice.

It was around 13:15 when i left to go meet Natalie at Sumiyoshi. We'd planned to spend the day together. We made our way to Shinchi then Hamanomachi. Did a bit of gift shopping. I also found a stuffed daikon man which i was seriously tempted to buy. I mean, how often do you hear someone tell you that they have a plushie daikon? You don't. My only problem at the time was the lack of money as i bought an Ultraman figure for my youngest brother.

We ended up having lunch at Gyuemon in Hamanomachi which was quite nice. Natalie's meal was huge and oh-so-delicious looking. That was her first proper meal all day. All she'd had before that was a doughnut. 

Anyway, we made our way back to Sumiyoshi and did a bit more shopping. It then that i received a c-mail from Brett asking if there were any plans tonight. Turned out that he wanted to do a bit of karaoke. Natalie and i were both happy to partake in said activity so we made our way to Taito and proceeded to wait for Brett's arrival. We played House of the Dead 4 and bought Gundam Pilot cards so that we could play on the new Gundam game some other time.

To make a long story short we karaoked and ended up spending the night at Brett's place, which was likr a freezer!!!! DEAR GODDESS HIS APARTMENT WAS FUCKING COLD!!!!! Natalie and i ended sleeping on the floor on his heated carpet instead of the spare freezer-imean, bedroom.

14th Jan-Woke up *at exactly 7a.m.*. Don't fucking know why. Just did. Damn internal alarm. Anyway, managed to find my way out of the backstreets of Nagasaki and intocivilization, also known to me as any street/place that i could recognise.

Made my way back to the dorms, had breakfast, played on the comp. for a bit then went to bed for a bit of shut eye. I wasn't feeling particularly stellar that day. When it was time for to get up and tidy my room for Natalie's ineveitable arrival, i could not, for the life of me, get out of bed. It's kinda funny after saying that i managed to make myself get up and answer my phone when it rang. 'Twas mother dearest. It was actually thanks to her that i forced myself to get up and tidy up somewhat. Good thing too 'cause as soon as i'd finished with the call, Natalie had e-mailed me to tell me that she was on her way.

Tidymashou!

But yeah, she came, we worked on the questions for my interview project, on which i kinda gave up on half-way through as i was feeling too shitty to continue with it, chatted, went and had dinner, stole some for Natalie, chatted some more, showed her out and conked out.

15th Jan- Felt extraordinarily better that day. It must've been a 24 bug of some kind. Either that or i *seriously* just needed some sleep. Went to Japanese class, got handed another project (Woot. Questionnaires...), met up with Natalie and finished off the questions for my interview project. During my free time i decided to be productive and work my Tuesday project. The presentation one. Had history (our last one) and then went back to the dorms sans Natalie. Ended up being bored for the rest of the day as i nad nothing better to do than work on my projects.

Here's a bit of a rant, for my questionnaire project i ended up getting grouped with Nick and Lorna. Joy! I know they'll both do fuck all. I was hoping to get paired Leigh and/or Rob ('cause i know theat they'll do the work with me) but they formed a pair by themselves so...
I'm going to have to come up with 10 questions concerning our theme (Eating lucnh at Gaidai)by Monday, which i *will* do. I'm not letting them pull me down. I want to fucking pass damn it all!

16th Jan- Woke up, had breakfast and immediately went to work on finishing my essay/ presentation. Went up to uni early and finished it there with a bit of help from Natalie and Miho in translating a bloody bastard of a sentence. Sent it via e-mail to the teacher and printed out a copy just in case. Also took my interview questions to be checked by Chun-sensei (Thurs Japanese teacher). Turned out that i had to rewrite questions 7-12 as she didn't like how  the next question depended on the previous answer. 

Yesh. It confused me a bit too.

So yeah, went to Jap. class, listened to Leigh's, Lorna's, Rob's and Kang's presentations. Rob's made me hungry. Damn him for doing it on sushi! Afterwards, i dragged Natalie back to teh dorm with me, stole her some food as per usual and we sat and chatted. Watched a bit of TV too. One of my channels was a bit better than usual. We ended up watching these performers singing these old Enka and Okinawan songs. They were pretty cool. We played MASH-O. I ended up getting married to Morgan, my house is a shack, my car is the Anperos bus, living in the countryside, my pet is Mark (Yes, the teacher. I'd shoot him to put *me* out of my misery.), i'll have 3 kids, my job is a host mom, my wedding dress is whipped cream and my salary is $100 an hour.

...Enough said.

Natalie left after a bit so i was left to my own devices which meant work.

My room is a tip. I need to give it a thorough cleaning...

17th Jan- Today! Skipped Peace Studies as it is the most boring class in the world and Mark is so long winded! Did the interview with Natalie (Yay!) but there turned out to be a problem. You see, when my teacher checked the recording it turned out that we had pu the recorder on the mode that records twice as fast so when you listen to it in standard mode it sounds like you're listening to Chip and Dale speaking in Japanese. 

Natalie and i cracked up listening to the entire interview in standard mode but what really made us laugh was that we could still understand what was being said! Oh the hilarity. I have to write up the interview and i can't do it without listening to the tape so Chun-sensei (Bless her heart and soul.) let me borrow the tape recorder and told me to return it when i had finished with it.

She's going to be getting it next week.

After classes, we went to Hamanomachi for a bit of shopping. I bought some cute jewellery which i'll wear tomorrow. Cost me a bit but i refuse to regret and i say this while crying twin waterfalls.! T_T

We then went to Taito, played some DDR (I've improved *slightly*. Just need to know how to move my legs...), played the drum game (That was really fun!), played House of the dead 4 (Kept feeding money into the machine and we had a bit of an audience!) and finally we did some print club! Yay! 

For dinner we went to the yaki niku tabehoudai. Translated that's the all you can eat barbeque and i tell you now, we *ate*. Well worth the 2100 yen we paid for all that beef, squid and chicken we had. Let's not forget the ice-cream. Yummy yummy ice-cream...*drools*

We *rolled* out of that restaurant and to the bus stop for our buses. We said goodbye and parted ways. The end.


One last message. To all the people i'm sending stuff to, forgive me please! I swear i'll send it all soon! I just need to find some bloody envelopes!"

"event","Went to uni, had my one and only class, sucked at said class (we debated in Japanese...), then proceeded to wait around in the gaijin zoo until it was six so that i could go down to Anperos and have dinner. I was fucking starving and when i'm hungry i whine. 

Natalie came to the dorm again, which was fun. After giving my room key to Natalie and telling her to go on ahead, i thought i would take the honest approach and ask the dorm staff if it was ok to have a friend eat dinner at the dorm. To make a 15 min conversation short, they said no so i took a different approach. I remembered that i had some plastic boxes (tupperware to you American friends o' mine)so i grabbed one, put in a handbag i got from Mister Donuts, took it downstairs, put a shit-load of food on my plate and then proceeded to put most of the food in said box.

Yes, i stole food from the cafeteria. Natalie ate it quite happily. Hee hee.

After that, we sat and chatted a while, also made some plans for the weekend. 

After that, we made our way to Biado! Woot! Gave Sachi his late Xmas pressie, finally. When we got there we saw Arty. Brett came by later and so did Kenny. Just so you know Kenny only showed up because i promised a whiskey and coke if he did.

I keep my promises.

Clinton came by and so did Yung Ho (Korean friend dude).

We sat, chatted, ate, drank, smoked, studied (that was me trying to read the newspaper. need to learn more kanji)and all that jazz.

Natalie stayed until about 21:50 'cause she had to go catch the bus. I stayed until 11:45 and Sachi gave me a lift back to the dorms. Bless him.

So yeah. Fun was had by all and i think i'm developing a taste for sashimi. 

Oh yeah. Got an e-mail from my dad asking me when i was coming back so that he could start preparing for the family summer holiday.

Hate to break it to you pops but i'm not coming back until early August! Thank the Goddess for that! I hate our family holidays! They never turn out well and it's always *always* because of dad and his fucking temper!

I feel sorry for my other bros though. They're going to be forced to go i'm sure. Oh well. There's nothing i can do to help them except warn them. Which i did.

Yesterday, went to school, met the people who i call friends and spent most of time with said friends. Mainly with Natalie really. We caught the free bus into Sumiyoshi and went shopping where i proceeded to spend shit loads of money on xmas pressies. Very *late* xmas pressies. 

I bought taiyaki! It's a cakey pastry that's filled with either red bean paste, white bean paste or custard cream and shaped like a fish! I proceeded to name my fishy Pete. He never survived the encounter.

He will be remembered with much fondness.

Dragged Natalie back to the dorms with me (she might be moving in next semester! here's hoping!) and she had dinner there too. dragged her and Aya up to my tip of a room. I had to give Aya the Xmas pressie that Clinton gave me to give to her.

Later Brett c-mailed me and to make a long story short, we went to Jinya. Sat down, chatted and drank of course. Natalie had to leave early to catch her bus back home while i stayed for a bit longer. At least long enough for Brett to get another sugar daddy! This old guy comes up brandishing a bottle of sake saying ""Drink sake! Drink sake! I'll give it to you!"" (This was in Japanese at the time.) then hands it to Brett who's ecstatic at getting a free, almost full bottle of booze.

It was soon after that that i had to make my way to the bus stop to get back to the dorms. *sighs* damn curfew! I really hate the curfew here. If they could just get rid of it then everything would be perfect!"

But yeah, yesterday was the first day of school. Back to school again. Yay... Said 'hi' to everyone, asked them about their holidays etc.  Had only one lesson which was Japanese. Handed in the essay the teacher asked for but i explained to her that i didn't like the topic (Japanese architecture) and that i was writing another one (Japanese Festivals). She said it was fine and told me e-mail me the other one when it was finished. I'll see if i can get Aya, Chimi or Miyuki to help.

Played Guild Wars a tiny bit last night. Finally managed to complete the quest that i kept botching up. I quit after that. Too tired to carry on.

That was my day. There's hardly anyone around now. I'm so bored and lonely. I'm trying to get the American girls to come out tonight to Biado but they said that Tomo (male Japanese friend) might be doing something with them tonight. *sighs* This might mean another night in my room. Meh...

Will go shopping today though definitely! Have to buy those presents for Rob, Justin and Kevin. I know excatly what to get them too. I just hope that they're still in the shops.

Might go to uni early today. Morgan promised pie and i'm hoping to see Miho!

"event","Hey all. Sorry i haven't updated in what seems like forever but i have a really good excuse. No, honestly i do and i bet that you'll all believe too.

I've been a lazy shit. Simply put.

Anyway, like the title says this a pretty condensed update.

31st December: Went to a New Years Party with Leigh, Kevin, Luke and Leigh's coversation partner  
               Hiro. He's the one who invited and got us in for a discounted price too. We had a 
               pretty good time if i say so myself. Got molested by another Japanese guy. 
               Woot... I was talking to NOVA teachers (who were from Britain!) when i felt these  
               arms wrap around my waist from behind. Turning around i saw this Japanese guy who 
               smiled at me and asked me to dance and i said 'ok' so we danced for bit. He then 
               turned me around and and planted a kiss on my lips saying 'Happy New Year'. 
               Nice... The rest of the party was uneventful after that unless you think Leigh 
               getting (lightly) slapped by a girl for thinking that she was being sarcastic      
               when she came up to me and said 'You are soooo pretty!'. Yeah...

1st January: Didn't do much. Stayed in my room all day doing shit all and playing Guild Wars.

2nd January: Same as above.

3rd January: Went out with Morgan to watch Eragon. DO NOT WATCH THAT MOVIE!!!! I give it a 
             thumbs up for teh dragon factor but other than that, it's pretty shit. Before the 
             movie we went and had lunch at this all you can eat buffet and it was really good 
             too. From 15:00 'til about 17:00 (me thinks) it's 1000 yen person and the food is 
             plentiful and delicious. They had an ice-cream machine!!! It took a hefty bit of my 
             will power not to put my mouth under the tap and and turn it on. Goddess do i love 
             the stuff. That reminds me, i owe Morgan 1000 yen... Played Guild wars when i got 
             back.

4th January: Again nothing much. Wanted to go out to Karaoke with Brett and his bro Matt but i 
             didn't have the money. The ATMs were closed because of New Years so i was a bit 
             strapped for cash. Played Guild Wars most of the day.

5th January: Got some money! Woot! But in the process of getting out more i ended up busting the 
             machine. Don't ask me how! Hell if i know. Went with Brett and his bro to Fukuoka 
             Airport. They needed someone who could speak Japanese. Matt was due to go home that 
             day so meh. Spent some time with Brett. Had some good conversations. I also got a 
             free sample of a new Kit Kat bar. It was 'sakura' flavour. It was quite nice 
             actually. Got back to the dorms had dinner and then helped the dorm staff translate 
             certain rules into English for these American students who were coming to stay at 
             Anperos for a week. Didn't have anything better to do than play Guild Wars, which i 
             ended up doing afterwards. Promised to help greet the students and take care of 
             them during their stay.

6th January: Once again, nothing much. I wanted to go shopping for a few things, clean my room 
             and do my Japanese essay/presentation but didn't. Did something else instead. You'd  
             never guess what. Yay Guild Wars! Met My Japanese friend Miyuki and gave her her 
             late birthday present. She responded by giving me my late birthday present which 
             was a disney night light lamp thing. It's actually quite nice.

7th January: Had breakfast then came back up to my room and played Guild Wars for a bit. After 
             that went shopping (finally!) and then came back. It wasn't long before i got a 
             phone call telling me to come downstairs because the American students had arrived. 
             Went down, said hello, introduced myself, took them to their rooms, gave them a 
             tour, answered questions and then left them to their own devices. They later 
             invited me to go out with them because they wanted some real food, which to them 
             consisted of McDonalds. I nearly cried. Damn McDonalds... I took them out, had some 
             Micky D's, had some Haagen Daas (yum!), went to the supermarket, the 100 yen shop 
             and then back to the dorms for some dinner. ""But you just ate!"" i hear you cry. Let 
             me tell you that a McDonalds salad isn't exactly very filling. Anyway, i met my 
             friend Chimi who had come back yesterday so i had dinner with her. It was fun. Much 
             conversing was to be had. She said that she had a late birthday present for me! I 
             was touched. Really! Went to see the American girls and find out how they were 
             getting along. Had to help them get theit air cons to become heaters. Damn kanji. 
             Sat with them chatting for a while until i got a call from Leigh asking me if i 
             wanted to go out to Taito (kick ass arcade of Destiny! With a capital D!!!) Luke is 
             leaving tomorrow so we wanted to do a last get together kind of thing. The girls 
             were welcome to come along. In the end only one came and that was Amy who's a real 
             cool gal. We took the bus there and i showed her a couple of places along the way. 
             Met Leigh and Luke there, played a few games, sang some karaoke and the played some 
             pool. Barely managed to get back to the dorms in time. Had to take a taxi. The 
             driver took one look at me and instantly said that i was beutiful. *sighs* This is 
             the fourth time i've been hit on my a Japanese guy. I just don't know if i should 
             be flattered or not. I promised that i'd take the girls to Biado (Beard. It's an 
             izakaya. A Japanese style bar.) tomorrow. Sachi (the owner) is going to have some 
             fresh meat! *cackles* Sexual harassment anyone? The only who's prepared is Amy and 
             she promised to keep it from the other girls. She's going to have as much fun as i 
             am! Oh, i can't wait!

That's all for today. I think that i'll go to bed now. Night all."

the dorms are rather spiffy. a tiny kichenette, space for a fridge and a washing machine (if you wanted), a hotplate, a decent sized room, an ok bed, a balcony, air conditioning, bathroom and toilet and the best thing of all unlimited internet!!!!! well, it will be unlimited when it`s set up next week. i look forward to it and to my many downloads and pieces of odd and random research!

another great thing is that when i walked into the dining room for the first time, several girls (that i`m friends with) were ecstatic that i was now living in the dorms so later on we`re going to meet up and go out for some fun! Yay!

better go now. my time is almost up. i`m on the public dorm comps. until my own internet is set up.

just one more thing. as sappyand cheesy as this sounds, thanks to everyone who was there for me. especially ro as she supplied me her hugs of warm and squishy goddness! 

things are looking up a bit now."

"event","according to my host family i have sunk to new levels of evil. i admit that they didn`t word it as such but that`s what they implied. to explain, i have to start from the beginning which was saturday. 

saturday: just as i was about to leave the house to go and visit my pal of pals leigh, i bumped into my host mother who asked if i was going to leave at that moment. i replied `yes` and then she asked me if i had a little bit of time to talk. being the fool i was, i said yes. to make a long story short, we spent *30 mins* going round in circles which the main question being ""why didn`t you register your laptop on the internet at university earlier?"" earlier as in when i first started uni. i swear to the lady that i was so on the verge of losing my temper and that i would`ve have wrapped my hands around her scrawny and flimsy neck... you know what else? she also said she was disappointed with my level of japanese. let me tell you something. on my profile i circled ""ma-ma"", which means not bad, for my current level of japanese. she should have expected it to be not so great. stupid bitch.

now on to sunday.

sunday: all was well. got up, did some laundry, left to go meet hillary, leigh and brian at sumiyoshi so that we could go and visit the penguin aquarium. got there, waited, hillary showed up a little later and we both waited for leigh and brian but they never showed up. we waited for 1.5 hours. as you might have guessed, we both got fed of waiting and decided to go to the boys` dorms to see if they were still there. we got there and it turned out that leigh was sick therefore he had a legit reason for not turning up. all our ideas for payback went flying through the window. anyway, we ended up spending the rest of the day with him. later on he was feeling decidedly better and so we made our way to taito to play some pool. i have improved!
anyway, hillary and i both ended up missing our buses back so while she stayed with leigh at his dorms i ended walking for over an hour making my way back home. when i got home i was let in by my host sister to who i thanked and apologised to for being so late and forgetting to call. now read closely, this bit is important. after asking politely if i could eat a mikan (satsuma/clementine) i explained to her why i was late. got that? good `cause it`s going to pop up again later. after all was said and done i went up to bed.

monday: i kid you not when i tell that on this day i experienced one of the worst evenings of my life. after going to see okunchi and having okonomiyaki with the wonderful wonderful friends, i was making my way back to the host-family. on the way, i quickly stopped at an internet cafe to check my e-mails. lo and behold, i get a couple from my bro. one of the e-mails he sent packed one hell of a punch.

my parents are getting divorced.

you can imagine that this would ""throw me"" so to speak. i was upset. very upset. after sending a reply i quickly left. when i get to the house i ask them politely if i could use their internet to call my mom for a few minutes. i also explained to them why. i got the use of the internet and a tiny bit of sympathy. i called mom and had a chat. i wanted to talk for longer than 20 mins but i couldn`t. after the talk and crying for a the duration of the call (rather discreetly so that mom wouldn`t get upset herself and start crying too but this time for my sake) i went downstairs for dinner and my host mother, the insentive bitch, decides to make my parents` divorce the topic of today`s dinner conversation. after having my feelings and heart ground to dust she decided to have another talk with me. about what i hear you ask? the internet of course! along with me being selfish, arrogant, ignorant, make a lot of excuses etc etc. oh, and a liar. we spent over an hour ""talking"" with the dad intervening a couple of times. later on she starts saying the mizuki (host sister)interprets for me, likes the english people alot, does a lot for me etc. i explained that mizuki and i were two different people, she agreed immediately with me saying that we were very different. i thought `score!`, now we`re getting somewhere. she then proceeds to glorify mizuki by saying that she doesn`t make excuses, that shes`s obedient, is attentive, doesn`t lie, thinks of others etc etc etc ETC!!!!!!!!!!! she then tells me that i`m nothing like her daughter.

no shit sherlock! what gave you the first clue? the skin colour? the fact that i`m raised with 2 different sets of traditions, beliefs and customs? 

also please make note that my parents are getting divorced, she happily laughted over it at the dinner table and followed it by disreputing my character.

oh yeah. she also told me that a teacher would be speaking to me at sometime. bring it on...

you can imagine that i now absolutely detest and despise my host family and i cannot wait until i get out of their on the 23rd of december. the only problem is that it`s so far away...

this was my weekend. how was yours?"

"event","oh dear goddess! my legs are aching so much! this is what i get for agreeing to dance two traditional dances here at nagasaki gaidai. why am i doing the two? elementary my dear watson! i originally signed up for the yosakoi (the costumes are really perdy!) but i was then asked by a pleading natsumi (she teaches souran and yosakoi along with mayu and some other girls) if i could please join the souran dance because there weren`t enough people.

i just couldn`t say no, could i?

for those of you that are curious, the dances are yosakoi and souran. souran is the ""fisherman dance"" which is rather simple as you mainly have to repeat the same moves. my only problem withit is that i have to crouch a lot in various positions so that`s a bit killer on the knees.

yosakoi, unlike souran, is a lot more complicated but still fun. it has a lot of different move which aren`t hard to do but just a little difficult to remember them all. especially when the girls are teaching us rather quickly and the minute that they think we`ve got it down they teach us some more.

hence, complicated.

other than that i`m having a great time! despite the lack of internet *eye twitches severely* at my host family`s place. they give me the occasional 20 mins and by occasional i mean once a week. AND THEY HAVE F*****G BROADBAND!!!!!!!!! in desperation i get my interent fix at uni but it`s just not the same!

i can`t wait to move into my other host family. they have broadband too (according to lorna who`s living there now and will still be there when i move in) and i don`t think that they would mind me using it just that little bit more than 20 mins a week! 

i`m hungry. *le growl*"

"event","Right. Went grocery shopping with the host mother today and bought a few ingredients to make an Egyptian meal. Hoorah. After that host mother dearest wanted to go a particular store so i went with her. To make a long story short she ended up buying a 14,700 yen handbag which i thought was overpriced and not worth it as it was a nice looking bag. I gathered that my host mother didn't seem to think the same way i did from the multitudes of 'kawaii desu ne.' coming from her and the shop asisstant.  

Got back home and started cooking to get everything done for dinner. Again, to make a long story short they liked the food, especially the chicken. *evil grin* Everyone always loves the chicken..."

"event","Ok. This was a bit of a harrowing experience. While my host mother was cooking dinner she and i were talking about the previous people she had hosted before me and what they did on the weekends. The reason why we were on this topic was because my host mother seemed surprised that i had not gone out yesterday and had no plans for the rest of the weekend.

This is not unusual for me.

Anyway, we somehow got onto the topic of customs and manners in Japan and she then began to explain to me in a mixture of broken English and fluent Japanese what i was supposed to do and say in certain situations. For exmaple, before i eat a meal i have to say 'itadakimasu' and afterwards i have to say 'gouchisousama deshita'.

Luckily i understood most of what she was trying to say but i do admit to be somewhat frustrated at one point because i couldn't express myself properly and theer were some things that i couldn't understand. Oh well, STUDY HARD!

Anyhow, back in the wonderful world of freak-the-shit-out-of-me, we managed to stray onto the topic of what foods i could and couldn't eat. It was to my surprise that i find out that beef is an expensive meat, chicken is ok in price and pork is the cheapest. Vegetables and fruits are also slightly expensive, especially after the typhoon that occured earlier in Nagasaki. 

Ok! Thanks for telling me this little piece of information but why are you asking me to cook Egyptian food for you?!

*sighs* I was ""encouraged"" to cook some Egytian food for them tomorrow. There's no way i can get out of it because my host mother is skipping around the house saying 'tanoshimi' whenever she sees me and she's also told the rest of the family. As a result i have shut myself up in my room and studied before i decided to update my journal.

Minna-san, wish me luck."

"event","Ladies and gentlemen! Last night, for the first time in my life, i was drunk. Yup. I drank wine, Jack Daniels and coke, some French whiskey, and two large cans of beer. Just so you know, i'm not a lightweight but beer does get me drunk unusually quickly. 

What was i doing? Well, it went like this. I ended up being a rolling, affectionate and coherent drunk. I was aware of what i was doing and saying hence the 'coherent' part. 'Rolling' because i was flopping/ rolling from place to place. And last, i was affectionate because i kissed two guys on the lips (the second one kissed back! ^_~). 

Just because i was aware doesn't mean that i was in control.

As the night wore on i managed to make my way to the bathroom and throw up in the toilet. Now, with me being me, i somehow (rather considerate of me i thought) managed to clean the toilet to a point where it was spotless. I was still drunk, just so you know.

Anyway, after crashing in my friend Raymond's room for the night (we were at a hot springs resort in Unzen so there were 4 to a room), i woke up feeling refreshed and just fine! It was only as the day wore on that i started to feel steadily worse. 

My first hangover. Hurrah (please note sracasm).

What put the icing on the cake was that in the morning we went to climb Mt. Fugen. I had to stop every 5-10 mins to rest not because i was tired but because i was so ready to chuck up my breakfast, which i did when i reached the half-way point. I didn't go up any further than that even if i did feel better afterwards.

All in all, i have learned that being drunk is not fun at all. I will never *ever* get as drunk as i did last night. Not if the consequences are so sickening!"

"event","So far so good! All is well in Japan but it's somewhat hot at the moment. I'm with my host family, the Kumagawa family, and they're the nicest people in the world! They're very nice! Mizuki (the daughter) speaks English just as well as Mom. Mrs Kumagawa can speak a little English but it's quite good. Junpei (the son) introduced himself to me in English and i introduced myself in Japanese. The father doesn't speak any English at all. Not a problem though. 

I'm trying to speak as much Japanese as i can with them. No matter how many times they tell me that my Japanese is ""very good"", it's not so it needs to be improved. Seriously. Hence many talks and time spending with said host family.

OOOOOOHHH!!!! I got some new manga today. Absolute Boyfriend 1-2 by Yuu Watase. It's quite cute but a bit rushed. Here's a little summary. Riiko Izawa is a young girl who's been rejected by every guy who she's asked out. After her latest rejection Riiko is wondering around and happens to find a ringing cell phone. After answering she ends up meeting its owner and as a reward he decides to grant her greatest desire. A boyfriend! (I want one too, damn it all! >.<) The next day she receives a parcel and presto! Instant boyfriend! He's cute, sweet, smart, can cook and is basically just perfect! She has him for a trial period of three days and if she doesn't return him by then she'll have to pay for him. A $1,000,000 is a steep price to pay, ne?

Good manga, ne? *takes a swig of coke* Mmm! Nummy!

Ah. The storm's calmed down a bit. *takes another drink*

<font size=""1"">Canon: <i>Look, out in the sand! It's a rock! Wait -- is it a cactus? No! No, it's Temari, and this beginning is so overused and trite slkjkfs sorry.

Temari is the older sister of Gaara and the eldest of the ""Sand Siblings,"" an orphaned ninja family from the Hidden Village of Sand (also known as Sunagakure). Growing up with a psychotic killer for a little brother made it fully necessary for Temari to develop the brains, inner strength, and s'awesome ninja abilities needed to survive in Gaara's disturbed and violent presence, blood-relation or no. Though her character development has never taken complete center stage in the manga (fillers do </i>so<i> not count), it is blindingly obvious that her past has pushed Temari to become a strong, ruthless-but-fair-minded woman... while still letting her be a girl that worries and frets over her dysfunctional family.

Her abilities include using a large iron fan to blow away trees, summoning adorable evil ferrets to blow away whole </i>forests<i>, and passing snarky little comments about the ability of the men in her life.</i></font>





Using the undead to kidnap the Kazekage.

If this didn't involve my brother, I think that I'd almost be able to appreciate the level of originality. It's beyond the usual 'underneath the underneath,' I'll give you bastards that much... but what is simply a new threat will <i>not</I> terrify Suna into abandoning its leader like you think it will. <font size=""1"">Our village isn't run by ""Monsters, Inc."" and I am jamming an iron fan into the first fool who implies again that it is.</font>

Suna's other ambassadors have been ridiculously generous in their diplomacy -- your swamp village is still standing, as previously negotiated in our letters -- but I most definitely don't possess the same level of patience of those superstitious councilors. Like hell if I'm going to ignore the political capacity I have to demand that Gaara be released <i>immediately</i> into my escort, unharmed and without complications -- and <i>no</i>, without any strange curses on my brother, either. I'm not bringing back some tiny kitten to protect Suna with; that's ridiculous.

My request for my brother back won't be denied, and you are not going to throw another lame excuse at me again. Gaara is not too busy sanding down someone's carpentry, powdering his nose, playing the part of a creature in your black lagoon, or whatever other complete bullshit you've tried assuring our village with.

If you've hidden him, fine. I'm not against leveling this eyesore to the ground to find out where he's hidden. Even if some of your underlings managed to vandalize my fans with -- <i>whatever</i>, a few Icha Icha rejects aren't going to stop someone like me. I will leave <i>no</I> stone unturned when it comes to Gaara, because my little brother --






-- pretending that the Kazekage is a panda is not... is there something <i>mentally wrong</i> with you?"

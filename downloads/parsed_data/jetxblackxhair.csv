"event","I have decided to become a lesbian. I've never done anything like this before but I don't care how many scene points I'll lose for that. I love pussy. At least that's what I've been telling my self. And what sounds more hardcore ""My boyfriend and I share pants"" or ""My girlfriend and I share pants""? I'm going to start a lesbian hardcore revolution. Now I just need to find a girl in a band... The lead singer for the Isness seems pretty hot. I wonder if she's vegan. We could eat edamame and compare our petite bodies in the mirror. I should add her on myspace. And then I'll have 436 friends. I hope she'll leave a comment everyday and reply to my bulletins and read my blogs. Her name even has an 'x' in it. I think I'm in love.

I love pussy. Yes. I. Do."

"event","I think I am going to become a fruitarian. It seems like such a beautful way to live.

Eating only fruit, nature's candy, is the most hardcore change I can make in my life. And that's exactly what I need. This life of mine has been lacking meaning. I need a change of scenery. Seeing the same dull, sullen faces everyday has grown so tiresome.

In the end, it's always just you and me, El Jay."

"event","I went to the Coma Recovery show on Saturday. It was so beautiful and life changing. To watch Danny up on that stage, looking like a Vegan God, it almost repaired the deep wounds charred on my vascular organ. If only I had the courage to open my mouth and speak to him. You have no clue how many scene points that would get me. I might even become Queen of the Scene if we started dating. 

Well it seems that I got my period. I feel as though my soul is bleeding out from between my thighs. I should cut back on the boca burgers. Maybe then I can stop the bleeding of my ever suffering heart. I have to take a bath now to wash away the stains of my inner torment. I hope I cut myself shaving."

"event","I never want to see another checkered pattern again. I was forced to go to a ska show. Utterly disgusting. The whole ska scene is just an excuse for those dorks to get together and wear their father's hand-me-down sutis and call each other ""rudie"". I'll show them rude girl. Thank god for the Westwood Tiger's party to save me. Colin was there. *swoon* But of course I couldn't escape the ska. That asshole drummer from the Big Spank was there and started yelling out ""faggot"" and ""nigger"". I almost busted out my brass knuckles. Ignorant biggot. People need to understand that this is the time to unite. We must join together. Unless you're a right wing Christian. Then you can go fuck yourself with your religious bullshit. Asshole."

"event","I wish my boyfriend was as scene and hot as Colin. Oh how those blue eyes haunt me when I dream. You. All I think about is you. With your Duke City Tattoo. And eyes so heavenly blue. Kiss me in the circle pit. Windmill next to me as though we were slow dancing. The fact that I cannot be with him makes me want to cut my leg. Shall I carve a ""C"" into my flesh as a token of my undying lust? *le sigh* Being vegan is so hard."

"event","My life feels so empty. People in the scene don't seem to understand that it's not about fashion. It's about the music. And being vegan. This is the only scene that allows me to be the non-meat eater I am. My boyfriend and I cut ourselves last night after snorting some white. We really connected and it felt so nice to have this deep, internal and emotional connection. We don't need have sex to feel that way. 
<lj user=""xbleedingxcorex""> understands this difficult and redunant life. But she's only vegetarian so she'll never fully understand.


Looks like it's just you and me, LJ."

"event","If you watched the game today and had the stomach to sit through it, I applaud you. If you didn't, applaud yourself because there wasn't much to witness unless you're an Angel fan. In which case when you're done feel free to take your own life.

I don't think I could quite possibly be more angry with myself right now. Which, you know, was the same thing I said at the end of last season. I preach to no end every time I make a mistake that it will be the final one I make and then I go fuck up again. This season I'm not going to take complete blame for it. Yeah I could have done better but there were other errors and other nights that I didn't suck as hardcore. Everyone else can believe whatever they'd like but for the sake of my own well being, I'm just going to stick by the fact that I had an off night and had it been a regular season game there would be tomorrow. Now there is no tomorrow but there is next season and while I hate saying that once again, it's all I can do. I can just hope I hit better, field better, and just become all around better and if not then I'll stay here on shit creek with my fucking straw and drink it all up. 

Right now would not be the perfect time to meet any Yankee player or roadie because we're all pretty pissed off or upset. This very well could be the end of some peoples careers and none of us feel too glorious about that. But the fact of the matter is that no one is going to get as much shit over the offseason as I will. I could hit a homerun in every game and make one minor fielding error and it would be my fault. While we're at it why don't we blame World War II, the bombing of Pearl Harbor and AIDS on me also. It's easy to sit here and say, ""I'll show them"", so now is pretty much the opportune moment to actually do it.

A few weeks back I wasn't as worried about the outcome of the season, I had bigger and better things to look forward to. Whether or not the season was extended or cut short I knew my honeymoon would immediately follow, and now all of that has been changed. I'm the only one who would like to leave this state and get away from it all, but I guess the reporters, and Red Sox fans, and arod haters of the world will get the best of me again this season and have my full attention. Up until the moment comes that I can just slip away from it all."

"event","I figured it's about that time since Tara was probably ready to force me anyway. Besides, I made history tonight and thats enough to fuel the thinking process for an update from me. Tara says I make history in bed every night but this time it was all because of baseball. I hit my 47th homer off Daniel Cabrera to not only tie the game, but to break Joe DiMaggio's single-season club record for home runs by a right-handed batter. Which is pretty much a big deal to me. If you are asking yourself who Joe DiMaggio is, which a few of you very well could be, please stop watching baseball, there is no hope for you. Right now I'm just living up the glory that is knowing I am going to be in history books that have yet to be written.

So we're down to the last four games of the regular season. Right now is a pretty hectic time seeing as we're in and out of first and tied every other day, so we're just trying to keep it steady and be able to see some playoff action. Every night we've gone on the field as of late we have played our hardest and if nothing comes out of it then there isn't much left we can do. All I can say is the better team always wins and hopefully it will be us this season. I really don't want to write it all off as, ""theres always next year"" again. 

Tara and I have decided where we're taking our honeymoon, and have decided it will be the day after the season comes to a close. Whatever day that will be. We're going to be on an island at a beach house away from everyone and it will be wonderful to get away from as much of the outside world as we can. We haven't been able to spend an offseason together yet since we seem to pick the most opportune of moments to break up. I'm really going to take advantage of not having to be in one particular place every day and spoil her until her little heart is content. 

Hopefully the next time I update this it will be a celebratory post. So if you're into that get down on your knees and ask God to make good things happen, add us to your list of things to shout out tonight. I love you, wife."

"event","It's been a week since I've last updated and my only excuse is that my wife enjoys my peen far too much for me to write a significant update. You all bought that? Alright good, because it's the truth. 

So for the past week or so, I've just been living in the glory that is married life. I really can't get enough of it. Everywhere Tara and I go, I go out of my way to introduce her as my wife, even to complete strangers. I would just like everyone to know that she is mine, and since we're married there is no chance in hell I'm going to share her. Which is why I almost took Robbie's life last night when he wanted to sleep next to her in our bed. Please. I don't even let people other than Jaime sleep within 10 feet of her. Plus, none of you are my exact size so you could never know what it's like to have her fit perfectly up against you when you go to bed at night, and if you tried/did, you wouldn't live to tell anyone. Let alone think about it.

I think ever since the wedding, our team has been in much higher spirits. Actually, I think I just like to make everything about me in some form. But really, it's a good enough reason. We've been playing so much better and picking up all the much needed wins. We even have taken over first place of AL East and aren't pissing in our adult-diapers with worry that we might not see the world series, again. Things are different this year though. Our support system is the same but feels different, maybe even stronger. It's either that or the rope Tara dangles in front of my face while she threatens to hang me from a tree if we don't win. It's motivation enough to take over the Red Sox so rather than call her psychotic, I think brilliant is a better word to use.

It's weird to think that not too long from now, baseball wont be consuming a good portion of my life. We'll have all the time in the world to be like any newlywed couple rolling in cash, and do everything we want. Tara has already made a list of the things she wants to do and although swimming with sharks without the aid of a shark-proof cage is one of them, I promised we could do whatever she wanted to do, so if I don't make it to next season, I apologize now for the Yankees going drastically downhill without me. I'm excited to go to all the places the two of us have yet to see, or even visit all of her skating places that we haven't had the chance to do yet. Plus, or honeymoon is coming up shortly and I can't even begin to describe how excited I am about that. It's going to be craaazy. We're going to make up a dance to the Dirty Dancing song and everything. I know, you wish you could come.

Lately I've been wondering if my mom contacted my dad to let him know that we got married. I know that he knew I was in another relationship after Cynthia but whether or not he knew we are this serious I sometimes think about. Mostly like whether or not he cares, or even would want to know. I have no desire to start this son/father relationship with him, but for some reason I really want to let him know that I'm everything he wasn't. And still trying to be. I can't wait to be a father and watch the little guy or girl grow up, because of him, I've learned through experience that growing up without your dad isn't fun. When people say kids blame themselves it's really the truth. I used to think that he left because I didn't play baseball or any other sport as good as he wanted me to. All of the things he did to my family is what makes me want to be more than that. I can never imagine being so low like him. I don't hate him, or dislike him, and I'm not mad at him, I just feel bad for him. He missed out on the one good thing that can ever happen to someone, having someone there who cares. The consistancy of having the same person there through thick and thin, the one who knows everything about you and still loves who you are. I basically just pity him, because he'll never grow old knowing exactly what thats like because he walked away from it before he could experience it. 

For months I knew what it was like to not have Tara in my life and it was a surreal wake up call. Sad to say, it was exactly what I needed. I spent too much time on me and not enough on her and before I realized it, our relationship was turning more and more into this one sided path. I wanted her there through everything, but I couldn't give that back and instead of trying, I just assumed it was all okay. There is only so much a person can take, and take, and take, before there is nothing left for the other person to give. That was the end of the line for us, and she was away for just the right amount of time for me to adjust what my priorities were. We had our long talk about my faults and the things that went wrong in our relationship and I can swear to it that nothing that ever caused problems in our relationship will ever happen again. I've never been the sappy guy until this stage of our relationship but I could really go on and on about her. There are so many new things I learn about her. Each day there is something new that surprises me and I look forward to waking up and sharing something else. It's things like this that make me want everyone to be this happy. Even people like my dad, who walk away from a good thing before they even take the time to see it. Thats all it takes is time.

I love you, my gorgeous wife. :-*"

"event","Last night Tara and I decided to sleep next to the wall last night so we could pretend we were still together. I have a hard enough time falling asleep without her next to me as it is, but seeing as what was going to happen today, my body was just not in shutdown mode. We stayed up as late as everyone else could possibly handle and then eventually it was just Derek and I still awake. We ended up sitting on the balcony talking about the crazy shit we'd both been through to get to the point we're at now. We laughed, complained and argued and then when he couldn't stay awake with me any longer, he patted me on the back and said, ""tomorrow will be great"", and then I was alone. And I sat there and realized that that night was going to be the last night I was the bachelor, Alex Rodriguez. Even when you have a girlfriend, if you're not married you're a bachelor, you don't have to be looking, thats just what you are.

When I was younger and couldn't fall asleep I would lay and imagine all of the great things that had happened to me, like if I went to an amusement park I'd think about all the fun rides until my mind got too tired to think anymore. The first few things I imagined where us as friends, the way she would playfully push me when we'd joke with each other, or how brutally honest she would be about my outfits. Then there was all the hardships, and remembering how difficult it was to watch her cry. I've never been one to be able to sit across from someone and comfortably listen to them cry, but it all came so naturally and I didn't even notice that I was holding her and trying to make everything better until after the fact. Just thinking about the wedding alone since the plans began I would get butterflies in my stomach strong enough to where my appetite would suddenly decline. I can distinctively remember having that feeling when my feelings for her started to grow. Hearing her laugh or voice coming up behind me would set them off and I'd immediately stop eating, just thinking about talking to her or seeing her would be enough. For a while she took it a completely different way and thought I had an eating disorder or something, until one night when I confessed everything for her, she understood. I remember the night we made everything official and how my hands were sweating, which was something that has never happened to me before. I kept rubbing them together and fidgeting and I was worried that she would take my hand and think I was crazy for sweating so much. I was only asking her to be my girlfriend but I was so nervous and hopeful that all of my feelings were running wild. I thought about how I quickly fell in love with her but hesitated to say it because I didn't want to rush her. The night that I finally gave in and said it, I was just as much of a mess as I was the night she agreed to a relationship, but the minute I said it and not a second after, she said it back and the butterflies suddenly returned. The thing I love about our relationship is that when I am by myself just reflecting on it, the best parts are the little parts. The ones where I can vividly see her laughing, or smiling, and that feeling that people say comes when you're first starting out but goes away after you really know each other, is like a permanent fixture for me. I can't get enough of her, everything about her.

The entire night the guys kept me from sneaking out of the room and ruining the point of not seeing her on our wedding night. I tossed and turned next to the wall after coming inside for a solid four hours, and when I noticed the sun was rising and everyone in the room was passed out in various places, I snuck out to her door. Don't worry, I didn't look through the peephole or see anything, and had she known I did this before the wedding she'd probably kick me, but I just sat there with my ear to the door. I knew damn well everyone was asleep but there was something soothing about knowing she was on the other side of the door and when she woke up, it would be to get ready to become my wife. I think that was the first time in my life I have ever told a door I loved it, but it was really aimed for her and hopefully it found it's way to her. 

I think I got about 2 and a half hours of real sleep last night, but I was wide awake when the wake-up call we set went off. Everyone ordered breakfast and then it was time. I had the worst case of the shakes while I was getting my tux on and everyone was laughing at me, but I couldn't help it. I kept telling people to go over to her room and catch a glimpse of her to tell me how fine she looked but no one would do it for me. So I had to just use my wild imagination but since I had no idea what the dress looked like, I had to just settle for her naked. Then the time came to go down and get in our places for the actual wedding. I got to shake hands with a lot of people who were arriving, and talk to everyone before I had to actually go in, and then before I knew it everyone was seated and it was about that time for her to come down the aisle. Her dress was beautiful, and so was she, and being the the metrosexual that I am just the sight of that was enough to make my eyes well up. She smiled at me and those butterflies I was talking about? They came right back.

I don't want to give specific detail to everything tonight because then my wife wont want to update herself, plus you all were there so there really isn't a need for it in the first place. To everyone who came out and helped to make this such a special day for us, I couldn't thank you enough. This is the day I have been waiting forever for, ever since I was mature enough to picture it in my mind, and it's one I wont forget either, and I'm glad every one of you were a part of it. Thanks again to my best man for being there last night when I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and to the rest of the wedding party for being such great friends to the two of us, I love you all. Our reception is still going but I had to take time out to get all of this out, because I've been dying to say it all. We aren't taking our honeymoon until after the season is over in October, so don't worry about us being highly absent from your lives for a little while longer. I'm still in my intial phase of shock that the rest of my life started today, and that I no longer have a girlfriend, or a fiance, or a 'significant other', but a wife. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get back to Mrs. Rodriguez."

"event","I am American League player of the month. So for all of you who are baseball illiterate, that means I am the best. I mean they think I'm only the best for this month but I'm the best for all months, they just don't want to go giving everyone more reasons to hate me. None of you might think this is all that great but are you American League player of the month? Nope. So bow down to me. I'm sure Tara is proud of me, because she always is. Shes my little cheerleader even though she has some competition found in Carl Pavano, but she is fine and he really isn't so she's got it all covered now doesn't she?

For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to attend the US Open and let Cynthia sit next to me. If you read Tara's update then you know the whole conversation to go along with the pictures but the best part was when she came back with a huge platter of nachos and said, ""NACHO MAN NO MORE CYNTHIA"", I swear I laughed for an hour straight and I am laughing while I type this right now. Why is my wife to be so hilarious? It's like the ultimate question, at least I know my abs will always be really hot because she'll make me laugh until we both die in our sleep holding hands. 

So secondly I'll talk about my bachelor party. Tara and I woke up relatively early so we could go shopping for some fly outfits to wear that night. I'm sure thats one thing she loves about me, when a girl usually needs a new outfit for an occasion and wants her man to go with her he usually says no. I suggest we go buy new outfits for all occasions so I really make her days as close to heaven as I can make them. So we went shopping for a couple hours, ended up buying more than just one outfit, but we looked pretty fly and got to get it on in dressing rooms so it was well worth it. We got back and lounged around for a while, and then got ready while Hova rapped Big Pimpin' in the background for us. Once we were done we made our way over to the Jeter residence to meet up with everyone before the dreaded split. Everyone hung out there for a while together, the girls left first and Derek had to make me not leave with them. Whatever, Mike got to go with them and I didn't see why I couldn't. I guess it was something about male strippers and what not and once I was told all of that I was immediately turned off from that gathering. I walked Tara all the way out though just to see her off, otherwise I'd wonder if she made it there, even though she was with a group the size of the ny mafia. 

Eventually after we got a little more tipsy than expected, us guys headed out to bar hop. Everywhere we went we had people toasting to us for the bachelor party, which was pretty neat. We didn't get bugged for any autographs either which was even better, it was a completely chill night. The last place we went we downed shot after shot in the VIP room and then in comes what Derek said was my High School Social Studies teacher and some other various strippers. I was about ready to lay him out but at that point I was so far gone all I kept saying was WHERE IS MY BEST MAN I LOVE HIM. I know, I didn't sound too much like I was about to be marrying a woman. I think every guy at the party was so trashed we were slurring, and stumbling and making complete fools of ourselves but it was so fun I can't even explain it all correctly. The strippers didn't last long since they really just weren't doing it for me and I gave them all blows to their self esteem when I made digusted faces or pushed them away from me when they came close. I'm really just over all of that and don't like to be around girls I don't know let alone have them be naked. So when no one could take any more alcohol without throwing up or being sent to the hospital we all made our way back to our transportation to Derek's. The girls were already back and talking about their night. Tara and I stumbled into each other and confessed our undying love for each other over and over again like drunken fools, but who could blame us really? We all hung out there for a while before we got back to our place and what all took place from there is just a blur. I'm sure Tara and I got out the Kama Sutra and turned page after page.

Unfortunately, now Tara is in LA and I'm making the Jeter's house me. It's not that I can't sleep in the house by myself it just gets boring to complain to myself. At least I have an audience if they are around. Tara had to turn off her phone at one point today because I called her 25 times in a matter of 5 minutes. But she is coming home in the morning to attend the game so I wont have to cry any longer or annoy anyone. We won tonight and hopefully we'll have the same luck for tomorrow. Wang is back to please the ladies so at least we know everyone will go home feeling great even if we don't. It'd also be outstanding if the Red Sox could lose because this winning stuff just isn't doing it for me. Whoever can make this happen, thanks. I owe you... nothing, but I'll be nice to you for a week.

In four days there will be one more Rodriguez in this world and she will definitely be the prettiest one. I AM SO EXCITED YOU GUYS."

"event","Tara and I were talking the other day about our wedding and how quickly the time was going by. She got a little dramatic and stood up and declared that 30 more days was too long to wait and that she was going to call off the wedding. If I didn't have a relationship of a little bit over a year with her and didn't know her like the back of my hand, I might have thrown myself into convulsions. But instead I let her go on her little rant while she tried to play off being serious, clenching her fists and all, while I tried not to laugh. I wish I busted out a camcorder, because it was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Eventually she laid back down with her head on my chest as usual and I told her I wish it was sooner. The idea must have popped into our minds at the same time because we practically said, ""The 12th"", at the same time. She looked up at me for serious approval and all I had to do was nod and our wedding date was changed. Those who were readily available found out immediately and were overwhelmed with excitement. We had to immediately wake Jay-Z and tell him there was a change of plans and that he needed to start to warm up his vocal cords because he didn't have the rest of the month to get ready. Now that an entire day has gone by that the news has been broke, it seems as though mostly everyone who was going to be in attendance, still will be. 

Tomorrow will be my memorable bachelor party, and if you're a guy on my friends list, or as Tara would say, proud owner of a penis, I'd like you to be there. I know it's really short notice and not everyone can drop any plans they've had for Labor Day weekend to come out to NY, but I would appreciate it. Plus, this isn't really a party you want to miss. I'll do Jaime a favor and announce for her that Tara's bachelorette party will also be tomorrow night, and I'm pretty sure you're aware of what criteria you need to meet to be invited. If it's a must need, I will fly you in on my personal jet that is equipped with both Mine and Tara's faces on the side. If that doesn't persuade you into coming out then only god knows what will. So, I hope to see everyone of the male variety tomorrow night. Wow, that sounded very gay. Please arrive on time because if you're late I might be too drunk to recognize you and/or forget you were ever there. 

The wedding will then obviously be a week from tomorrow. September 12th. I can't believe that in seven days I will be dubbed the happiest man in the world. Angels will sing from heaven and rays of light will shine down upon us, and I may even shed a tear. Alright, I will. I have been looking forward to this day ever since we planned it in April. The months really sped by, and I'm happy for that but clearly they didn't go fast enough because we had to move the date up. It was like it was meant to be, having two mondays off in a row, and it's worked out beautifully. Now, if there is no playoff action for us this season, which I really hope there will be, we can take a honeymoon immediately after the last game in October. I'm happy that I'll get about four solid months that I'll get to devote to my amazing new wife, and begin our lives together. It's weird to think that we started dating a year ago, but the beginning of the rest of it is going to come in a week.

If you've ever wanted to know what sheer happiness looks like in physical form, be in Miami on September 12th and I'll give you the perfect example."

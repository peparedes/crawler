My dad is wasting away he seems to be getting skinner every time I see him.my mom she is falling apart she is pale and swollen, and my brother....... I really think the steroids they put him on has done a number on him.his eye droops from the pressure the infection has on his nerves in his face, he's Huge I can't tell where the shoulders start and the neck ends... I'm not making fun of him it's just he doubled in size since I last saw him...while I was looking at them I kept thinking these three can die at any moment of any day and all I would be left with in terms of family members is. My sister, and all she cares about is her self.  I keep thinking is this the last year I would have a whole family? Or by this time next year would I be missing one, two, or three?  Depressing thought..."

"event","Last night i saw a  friend was on so i decided to say hi and see if he wanted to chat... well to my surprise  it was my friends girlfriend amy...My friend and his girlfriend live together so please understand my surprise when i heard she was planning on leaving him  because apparently he's been telling her he wants me.  Not knowing exactly what hes telling her i decided to try and keep my mouth shut unless she asked me something..  I felt horrible that shes going to leave him because of me.  Then he got online for real.  Another interesting conversation.  He told me he wished i went to the fireworks with him. I asked about him and Amy apparently he had to spend the night in a hotel.  He says they are fine he hopes... Then he goes on to say.... ""I love you... I loved you from the time we met at camden house""  Also telling me he wishes he could make love to me...  At that point im thinking CRAP!!!! What have i gotten myself into?  I don't want to be the cause of a couple breaking up... i feel rotten terrible because i know whats about to happen and i feel guilty.  I know i didn't ask for this.    I also know because those two been dating for a while... that this break up will probably cause him to relapse on his mental health.

Right now im just thinking hide me in a little closet so i wont be around ANYONE  then i know i wouldn't be hurting anyone from just being around them."

So one day when i was home and after a morning of nothing but insults from my mom i went upstairs picked a random bottle of pills from my luggage and threw it and left it.  I didnt know it was penicillin i threw nor did i car.  Another thing mom never goes upstairs so how could it have killed her?   I don't have the personality for killing people I hate the thought.  
So being accused of that just made my day priceless.  I'm so surprised how well im handling it all."

"event","Blues are the most caring, nurturing and protective personalities in the color-spectrum. They live out of their hearts and their emotions. Their life purpose is to serve, help and love others. Blues have an inner knowledge and wisdom and they feel and know what is right without needing facts or data for substantiation. The moment they become quiet inside, they will recognize or hear an inner voice or guidance, which will tell them what to do. They can easily tune into other people and feel precisely what is going on. Blues are the most emotional of all the color personalities. They often feel lost if they don't have the opportunity to clear their way through their intense jungle of deep feelings. Helpful activities for Blues would include talking with friends about their inner life, writing a journal or just being quiet so their intense emotions can calm down."

I got really sick of it and went to the dr yesterday my dr told my i bruised the bone in my leg and i will have pain for a couple weeks or more until it healed.  my parents picked me up and they decided to take me to the New Ulm   ER  we were there for 2 hours with an asshole of a dr  My Whole foot was swollen even my toes but that was not where the pain was in was in my leg.  Finally the Dr came in and told me what can we do to keep you off that foot and he told me not to take pain killers.   He also told me that i had a hematoma on my bone.  During the whole time he was telling us this i was watching my mom  one because i was in a lot pain two i was making sure she was not going to yell or pounce on the Dr.  She didn't she just said she will file a complaint.  I'm now on Crutches and those are hell  I'm wondering how am i going to get up the stairs to my apartment when i get back to it.

Matthew 5:31-32
IT has been said, who so ever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce: But i say unto you, that who so ever shall put away his wife,  saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and who so ever shall marry her that is divorce commits adultery.  

This is the words of Christ himself.

""Oh we have to talk to sharall  and she wont be back for a couple hours.  The clients knew i was feeling like shit and i had a hard time breathing  one said she was getting close to calling 911 My parents who called said if the staff wont take me and my parents had to they will call the state to report this place.  They finally took me that night and the dr was an ASSHOLE (and i dispise doctors)   he put me on antibiotics which in turn gave me a bad stomache ache .  The for the next 4 days i was wakeing up to new problems  like my ears being to sensitive headaches dizzy spells and i ended up loseing my sence of smell.  I was to afraid to lay down because if you lay down you could be put on house restriction.
Aparently Gary the guy in charge of this place has a grudge  My parents told me the other day that when i was here over two years before they called the state on them because i ran out of a med and was out of them for 5 days before i got them again and this med could cause sizures. so i guess he got in trouble.

on a different note.

Yesterday I let Jem know the truth about what i thought about him letting women control his life and boy did he let me have it.  I just didnt care that he did.  I'm just sick of him doing this to himself.  When i first met him he cared so much about Cheri that he was obssessed with her. He would tell me over and over agin that he would never date any one but then he asked me out .. :P  and he kissed me and told me he loved me (MEN)  Then he fell head first for a staff member who had 3 kids and a boyfriend her name way crystal now because she is not talking to him because she is afraid of losing her family i get 2 completely different stories about whats really going on and i get chewed out over the phone for no reason..  Then jem tells me cheri ruined his chance of ever being romantic  with any women and crystal ruined him ever having women friends.  
I down right told him dont worry he never will.. He asked me to explain and so i let him have it.  I told him with him letting women control his life and him being in a slump about it  he will cause his own trouble  he will hurt every one in his path until he gets out of it and stop letting women control him like that.  
He signed out after snapping at me again and i just didnt care. ... 
After that it just made me think about my life and how i let people control me and relizing i never want to end up like him!"

I should have believed what others have told me but i guess i had to figure it out by my self.  I think its stupid after 23 years my parents dont know me or understand me ... my friends know me more then my family does boy thats retarded.


Anyways...I finally got back in contact with a friend (Song) i havent seen or heard from in about 2 years... He told me yesterday he could of gotten back in cotact with me sooner but thought that it wasnt a wise idea for us to be friends.. at the same time he tells his friends im like a war buddy because when we would practice he could hit me and it wouldnt effect me.  He is now calling me his therpist because im the only one of his friends that would listen to him and care about what he is thinking and feeling.

I just found out my friend Noe is getting out of jail soon which im happy for him because it must suck being in there.  He told me last time we talked that he is going to try to see me when he gets out.... and he said he will help me get to know the town better.  Because even though i've  been in this town 3 months to the day i still get lost (damn it)  

My friend Jem is really upset in atwater funny thing is i warned him that place sucked but he didnt believe me. The stupid thing is i worry about him more then i worry about my other friends because i know if he gets into a fist fight he could go to jail.

Last thing in here is im trying to get healthy enough that when i am i can go into the military.  I want to be in the Mariens  and learn.   I know that its going to be hard both physcally and mentally but i know i can."

"event","What I got for Christmas was a designer l, pearl necklace bracelet and earrings, a ring, lipstick, beading kit , and a sewing machine.

The ones i'm happy about is the beading kit and the sewing machine.  I dont like everything else because im not that big into it ... i'm wearing the ring earrings, bracelet, and necklace to shut my mother up.  the wallet im not going to use because im not into designer stuff and i dont feel like ruining it just to show i will use it.  I don't like the lipstick because im not big on makeup.


I apreciate them getting me this stuff but come on they should know me better by now.... I think the funniest thing i heard was yesterday from my sister... I know you will like what i got you i know you... lol yea right thats why she got me a wallet... love my family but they dont know me worth a damn."

"event","The place im at is closing on the 31st of december.  They are trying to find places for every one to go.   They are having a very difficult time with me ....   Ive been filling out a mountain of paper work but no results yet... They are thinking about balaton but they dont know how im going to get there.   They said i could spend the night of the 31 in a motel room all fun and dandy but how am i suppose to get to the apartment?
I came down with a stomache virus which has now turned into broncitis because instead of resting like i was suppose to i had to be in groups and help the ""Men"" from upstairs move down stairs,  Which in my opinion was there BIGGEST mistake.  My ""Friend""  is being a pain in the butt we cant go a day with out arguing or cussing at each other... People think we are ""Love Birds"" but no we are just friends....  I'm not emotionaly ready for a relationship yet and i probably wont until i get my life back in order.

On the plus side... My baking is a hit at this house whatever i make disapears fast.  Another Plus since i've been at this place ive lost about 40 pounds ...."

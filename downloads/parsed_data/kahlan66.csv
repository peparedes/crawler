"event","So funny story after posting in my LJ and tell you all about my job, yesterday I got a layoff notice.  This means that Tim is looking for a new job oh ya new job for me.  So if you know anyone that is looking to higher me I work for about $14 per hour.  Other then that I am not really mad that I lost my job, I am just annoyed that I have to look for a new job.

The new stuff that I have not mentioned is that there is a cool 14th century tournament that I will be involved with on sat July 8th at the gazebo park just off whyte ave, where the farmers market is.  Everyone should come and check it out, as it is free.  It will start at 11am and go till about 4pm.  If you want to see knights in armour and trying to hit each other with a sword or mace or some sort of weapon that you have to come out to this.  If you want more info you can go to the website www.knightsofthenorth.ca"

"event","I dont think that i have entered anything in this for some time now.  So lets see....

Still working at that call centre where they dont pay me enough (makeing $10 per hour)not that bad of a job nut for some reason everyone that you talk to is dummer then the first person, coul have something to do with the fact that they are american not sure.

dont think that i have any new toys to talk about still playing psp and my newer computer is still working great.  I am making sure that i dont put any towels by it this time, just so that i dont have a repeat of the last computer that i had.

Something that you my not have known i Got a car.  For anyone that knows something about cars it is a 91 honda civic hatchback with lowerring kit, custom exhaust, uper air intake, rugade shocks, short shifter, fuel regulator. 
for the people that no nothing about cars this means that it is fast and has some racing modifactions on it.  This is good.
The car is white in color and has a sunroof.

Speaking of sun roof man an i glad that i have that because it is like 30+ here right now and it is so humid that it is like coming out of a hot shower, you know you can see the mist and you feel wet or damp even after you dry off.  The weather here is just crazy so hot so humid you dont want to leave the house. 

now speaking of leaving the house for everyone that still does not know i now am living in ontario and i am to be coming home some time this summer.  I have found out that i am coming home some time befor the last week of July.  This makes me very happy as i miss my friends a great deal and i dont think that i can take my brothers being around me much longer.  I will call the peoples that need to know when i am coming back once i have a date.

Other then this Life is ok and continues to go on even though i would not like it some time.  But ya, so i will have to go because i have plans this afternoon going into town to see one of my friends to play some games.  Hope all is going well for you and i will talk to you all later, some of you in person soon enough.
stay cool and e-mail me if you want to chat.

"event","It has been so long since i have put something in my lj that i dont know where to start.
My job is the most crappist thing that i think that i have ever done.  Dont get me wrong i like the call center idea but i dont like the people that i work for.  Most of the time my sup. has his finger up his ass and is little to no help at all and the rest of the time he is nagging at someone for being like 50 sec late from a break.  I for some reason dont think that i will be around there for very long because i have a bad habit of not being early back from my breaks.  Other then that like i said i like my job it is lots of fun i get to make fun of stupid people all day and laugh at the because they broke there phone or they cant read a bill it is very funny.

I just finished my week long visit with Liz that was really cool.  It was so nice to see someone that i know again other then my family.  There was really nothing to here so after the 10 min show and tell around town we were looking for things to do.  We went to karaoke on tues night that was cool it was the first time in a long time for me.  Wed we went to toronto because i had never been yet, there we went to playdium and square on which is a big mall that is suppose to be like the biggest in ontario and it is like 2 time the size of Kingsway mall in Edmonton.  I think that this is funny.  Other then that it was a nice week.  Stayed out in toronto till thurs afternoon which ment that i skiped a day of work oh well that really makes me sad.  Then fri liz went home.  I was sad to see her go because that would mean that life would return to normal what ever that was for me before.

Other then that not much has change in the last little while i get up in the morning and i go to work, i come home at night and then go to bed and this is what i do all the time.

The only other new thing is that i got my PSP and it is very cool.  I didnt think that you could get such great graphics in a some portable system but i guess that i was wrong.  I have been playing this thing non stop really since i got it and i think that i will be playing it for a very long time.  If you dont know what one is you will have to look it up if you really care to find out.

Other exciting things that i am planing to get is a new computer ever since i left that towel on top of the couch wich is right by my computer and then it falling on the computer it has not been working right i think that the heat sensor going off might have something to do with that. So ya i kinda have to get a new cmputer because i cant play anything on my computer without it seeming to skip like a dirty cd.  It seems that the only thing that i can do is go on the internet because that is not getting a constant flow on info.  Music is fun to listen to that is for sure.  I have to go back to those things called cds or something like that.  I was trying to forget what those where.

Anyway i think that is everything in a nut shell you can always e-mail me and talk if you want and i will be glad to talk to you when i have the time and my computer is working.  I hope that you all have a good day, week, month or what ever it maybe before i talk to you again.

Training for my job is almost over only like a week of class stuff and then i get to go on the floor for some hands on training for about a week i think and the i will be on the floor taking calls.  I just picked Grand Trismo 4 for the PS2 and put a payment on the new PSP that is to be release at the end of march.  This makes me happy as it will not only play games but also movies and for those of you with out an ipod you can play music as well.  I am not sure what else to tell you people because nothing is really new.  Tomorrow i think that i will go to walmart and see if i can get a set of free wieghts as i cant go to the gym when you dont know where one is.  Any who i am off to comtinue playing my game so i will talk to you all later have a great night and weekend.

There was so much snow falling that i couldn't see more then like 2 feet in front of the car it was crazy.  I had to pull over once because i need a break.  I hope that it is not like that tomorrow morning because i have to drive that again and that would suck hard core if it was still like that.  Anyway now that it is like 10pm at night i have to go to bed so that i can get up in the morning.  Hope that your days are not as snow filled as mine.

I would like to take this time to say that i miss you all and i hope all is well.

I now work at like 6:30am and that means that i need to be up at like 4:30 in the morning so that i can drive and hour to work and then work till like 3pm.  I have like 4 weeks of training and then i get to get a real shift and hopefully it is not at some stupid time of day.  All i do is go to work and sit on the computer there and then i come home and sit on the computer here.  This is no good in my books.
See how everyone that i talk to doesnt know where a bar is that has a pool table and/or darts this makes me sad.  I think that i will start taking karate or something like that as soon as i get payed becasue i feel that i am getting fat sitting and doing nothing all the time.  

There will be more later i have to take my mom to work so that i can have the car.

"event","Well Lets see what is now not much has changed here i when to my interview the other day i think it was thursday and i got a call back yesterday.  I got the job this is the first good thing since i got here that has happened to me.  I start work on the 14th of Feb.  In the next week i have to get an Ontario drivers license and then i have to get a security check and i also have to go to the bank and get my banking info.  There is a lot to do before then.

For some reason or another i went to bed at like 4am and slept until like 6pm i am not sure why, most of the time that i go to bed that late i wake up at like 1 or 2pm.  I guess that i need the sleep.

My brothers are officially load and they need a volume button on them so that i can turn them down.  All that they do is play video games and call each other names.  I think that it is cool to have people to play board games with but at what price so i have to pay.  For anyone that doesn't know my brothers are like 15 and 14 They look nothing like me nothing at all both of them are tall and skinny i will see if i can get a pic of them one of these days and then i will post it for all to see.

I think that is all that is new in my life right now so i will talk to you all later when something else new comes up.  Have a great day everyone.

Timothy

My mom sent a package via UPS and it was suppose to be delivered before i went on holidays and well i never got it go figure, so i didnt get anything from my mom yet. Other then that the holidays was ok i got to spend it with my aunt and uncles and my grandma. </P>
<P>Speaking of uncles... i was waiting for him to come home from victoria and was looking forward to it and now all i want is for him to go back. This guy is like 25 years old and he still acts like he was 5. All he does all that time is wine about everything and i mean everything. Why do i have to do the dished after i ate more then everyone else in the day. Why do i have to clean up the mess that i made, i will clean it later, that is the best one. I will do it later, he moved back in with his mom and had something like 16 boxes and he left them in the living room and said that he would clean it later ya that was the day befor christmas and he just finished cleaning them today because this girl that he likes is comming over on wed. or something like that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;AAHAAAAAAHAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! he makes me so mad </P>
<P>then i have my stuff in the room that he use to live in and he thinks that as soon as he gets home that it is his again. This is not the part that bothers me its the part that he comes in and knocks stuff off of the night stand and when i tell him to clean it up he says that its not mine and its not my fault that you didn't place it in the middle of the night stand.&nbsp; Then after that i was so mad that i left the room, he started to unpack his stuff (this is good) but in the process he moves all my stuff around and makes my stuff into a mess and then when i go back to the room i was like what the hell and he was all well your stuff was in my way. AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</P>
<P>then i clean up my stuff and put it in a nice pile in the corner and well in about an hour i go back down and guess what again with all my shit moved, this time he did move it all to the bed and unfolded my clothes that were nicly folded and in a pile.&nbsp; </P>
<P>As you can see i want to kill him he just doesn't care about anyone other then himself.&nbsp; To top off the rest of the day he says that his friend is coming over on wed and that i can't go into the basement where my room is because he want to spend time with her alone.&nbsp; So now i have to move all my stuff upstairs so that he can have the room for his dinner date.&nbsp; Funny thing is that from what i have been told she doesnt like him in that way but he keeps trying in a mean why i hope that he fails and she tells him how it is.</P>
<P>Well i think that is it for now i am off to bed to get a good nights sleep or so i hope so i will talk to you laterz</P>

"event","Well there is only 2 more days till i leave for B.C. and man has this week gone by so slowly.  To add to it work is over powering me with work and just for fun i get to move 80 computers into our office.  If you didn't know i work for a non-profit that sells dial-up internet.  One of the other things that we do is give computers out to low income families.  Thus people donate computers to use and we have to fix them.  And so tomorrow i have to move computers till i am blue in the face.

After that is said and done then i think that i will work on fixing some of them hope that i will have more success then i did today because in 8 hours i made one whole computer.  But that is what you get for working with used stuff.

Other then that i cant wait to go on my trip back to my home town Nelson, B.C. 
friday i get to sit on a gray hound bus for like 15 and a half hours oh ya what fun.

Anyways time for bed i need my moving sleep.  Have a good night all

"event","Well this will be a quick update about the last few days. Lets see
where do i start well.....
On Wednesday i worked later and i didn't get home until like 7:30pm and
i get off at 4:30pm, today i didn't get off work till like 5:30 or 6pm.
Why is it that there is so much work and not enough time to do it all?
<br>
<br>
Tuesday night i had sword fighting that was really cool because once a
month Johanus from the Academy of European Swordsmanship and martial
Arts comes and teaches us. There were like 3 of us that showed up at
practice and 2 of them had to leave 20 mins early so i had a private
instructor for about 15 min or so. He teaches us things like how to use
a dagger, hand to hand and to fight historically.
<br>
<br>
This evening i went to go and see Blade Trinity that was very cool you
must see it if you liked the first 2. Speaking of that does anyone know
where my copy of Blade 1 is, i know that i gave it to some one and now
i cant seem to find it. Blade 3 has a good story hot chick and really
cool blade toys. A good 2 hours spent that was.
Anyway as always i am late getting to bed and i have to be up in the
morning so have fun and stay safe from the vampires that will get you
at night.

write.&nbsp; Today everything went as it always does, i got up late as
always and went to work.&nbsp; Gregg came and talked to me well i was
there and we went to lunch.&nbsp; After work gregg came over and played
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas&nbsp; He thought it was cool. Other then
that all was the same, i think that i might go out with Shan when she
gets off of work how knows.<br>
<br>
The last weekend was kinda fun i went to Cow town with BJ and Erin to
see a friend of ours.&nbsp; most of the time that we were down there i
spent in a mall wandering.&nbsp; The only exciting thing was on the way
down we kinda hit a pole and i exploded into like 5 pieces.&nbsp; This
was very cool in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow i have sword fighting class and as always i am looking forward
to that. If anyone dosent know the website or has not seen it you
should go and check it out. <a href=""http://www.knightsofthenorth.ca"">click here</a> to check it out<br>

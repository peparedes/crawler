"event","i think last night was the most fun night i had on this trip.. as usual we went to the euro-youth hostel.. 

as we were leaving the guy we were talking to the other night was on the computer and he joined us (Charley). while we were there we had the watermelon dreams and a beer and a shot of the BAR TENDERS special.. 

little on later a guy walks over and starts talking to us.. really nice kid his name was Kyle and then his hot aussie frined Davis joins us..

kyle bought me this drink called yagger bomb.. its a shot of yaggermister and then a glass of red bull.. you put the shot of yagger inside the galss of red bull and then dink both at the same time.. it was really good.. maybe because i was already trashed... and shit shell broke his glasses.. 

i had a interesting converstaion with Charley and presidents and then he was trying to explain the difference from 1, 2, and 3 degree murder.. i got the 1 and 3 but 2 was confusing as hell..."

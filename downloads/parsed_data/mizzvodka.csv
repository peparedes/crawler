"event","Ok so, I know I haven't updated in for freaking ever. i almost even forgot about this thing but I've been smothered in work up to my knees, and I've been getting ready to leave on saturday which I can't wait. Things are pretty good. Eric and I are progressing slowly... no need for rush... My business is on it's way, and I'm swimming in the $$. All it took was patience and good planning. It finally happend. It's all going to the bank though. I don't need anything else.. I have everything I've ever wanted now it's just a matter of saving for my future. I was actually looking at investing it on condos around montreal. I found a good deal in Laval which is awesome. They're going to be building a metro station around the area within the year so as soon as that happens prices are gonna skyrocket by at least 80g minimum. I figure if the bank only gives me 90% cover of the condo, I can tell them that the condo is more than it is, so that 90% will actually cover the whole entire cost of it, I rent it out to people who will pay 850$ a month, 800$ a month goes to the bank, and then 50 in my pocket. I'm not even pay a cent. In fact I'm making money. Who would've thought. Least I learned *something* from that asshole of my father. I do this all for my kids. I don't want them to have to worry about school and how to pay for school. I just want them to finish university, nothing would make me happier, and yes I would pay everything for them if they did that favor for me- most importantly for themselves. I never got that opportunity."

"event","I couldn't sleep last night.
I made fliers for my lost kitty and put them up at 1:30 a.m on poles and mailboxes and stuff. *sigh*
When I woke up I took a look around my street and at least 3 of them weren't on poles anymore. I hope idiots didn't trash them. I mean, it's not even windy so it's impossible that they flew off. Plus I used electrical tape so they pretty much stayed put. I'm going to put them on the two closest churches to my area and the park today. I'm also gonna ask the people at the corner store down my street if it's alright if I post it up on their door.... I'm even offering a reward of 100$ for her return! I hope these people aren't selfish and bring her back to me if they see one of my fliers... Some people are jsut cruel and don't care.

I had weird dreams last night. It's very choppy but here's what I remember. I remember randomly walking around in black slacks and this brown 3/4 length blouse I don't own. It was so dull looking and I hate to be trendy right now but the colour didn't suit me *big giggle and grin*. The next thing I remember is being pressed up against my kitchen counter and bathroom counter while my ex and I had sex. My best friend and her ex were standing right beside us as though this was all perfectly natural. They were fully clothed but the ex and I were completely naked. The next thing I remember is that I got some job as a lifegaurd with my friend at this inddor pool. One of the other lifegaurds was giving me a tough time. The water was so tough to swim in, as though there was a current of some sort in the pool. After that I'm walking up these cement stairs with my friend steve, and my back is to his chest and he was pressing up against me getting turned on. Holy. I know I get horny when I'm drunk, but damnit. Maybe it's cause my last entry was about sex?"

"event","are you a slut just because you like sex? who the hell makes these definitions? a 'slut' to me is somebody (and no i'm not only talking about women because that's totally unfair and double standard) that uses sex in order to get what he/she wants, flaunts and brags about his/her escapades to the open public, or uses it to grab hold of as much attention as he/she could possibly absorb. Now, there is nothing wrong with liking sex. Nothing what so ever. If you are smart about it, power to you. It's nobody's business how many partners a single person has had in their lifetime. Does it alter their personality? No. A person should not be defined by their sexual activities, and it's too bad that so many people are judged by that, yet hate to be judged in that same exact way. It makes sense in my head. I'm somewhat drunk, I can't think properly."

It was cute. The messy hair, the floppy sandals, the soccer shorts and a plain white t-shirt. I told him he had chicken legs. He laughed. 
We kissed of course. He said it would be conitnued tomorrow when he saw me at Bocaccinos. I told him I couldn't stop kissing him, which I can't, and he had to literally put me in the car and muster up enough will power to get himself back in his house.

Mouna ran away... it's been 2 days now and she's not back. I can't stop crying.. she's so little and innocent. Her collar didn't even fit her. I could only imagine where she might be right now. The poor thing.. I love her so much.. I hope she comes back home. I hope to God she comes back home. My little moun. :( I miss her sleeping across my chest at night and waking me up by licking my cheek. She was a little purring machine and so friendly...

"event","I kissed Eric again. I can't stop freaking kissing him. Not like he tries to stop it either ;) It just seems routine now that whenever he drops me off in front of my house we get into a huge make out session that progresses further and further each time. Thing is though, you never know if he'll be the one to make the first move. He's tricky like that.

We looked at his backseat simultaneously, looked eachother straight in the eye both panting and gasping for air, tried to see if anyone could see us through the foggy windows, then shrugged off the idea. No, we wouldn't. Not the backseat of a car. Well, that wasn't our issue really, it was more hesitation cause we didn't know how it would affect the friendship. So far nothing has ruined.

We made it clear that we wouldn't have a relationship. If we did it would be after the summer. He wants to make sure my head is clear and I'm not jumping from guy to guy, which you know, is smart of him. He's a lot smarter than people give him credit for. Very observant but doesn't say a word.

My little Eric doesn't seem so little anymore. He's turned into something magical and sexy. Who would've thought."

"event","I'm having extremely mixed feelings about today. I don't know if it's the weather or what it is. I just feel really uneasy deep down. Kind of like I'm being watched but I'm not- I can't explain this.

I went downtown last night. As I left the restaurant with my friend there was a huge crowd in the center of the road hooting and gawking at some woman dressed in white on a balcony. My first impression was that she was some sort of celebrity to create such a spectacle. Celebrity? No way jose. Stripper? Maybe. She stood on a balcony overlooking one of the busiest streets downtown, teasingly lifting up her shirt to expose her plump breasts in a white bra, then pulled down her bra to well u know- show off her silicone. I was disgusted. We couldn't stop looking. I was just completely shocked. As we continued to walk down glancing back every now and then men would stop and tell us that we didn't have to look at that. That we were better than that. Pigs- yet they stood and oogled over it. I don't get men.
Watching that triggered something in me though. I felt sorry for woman. I felt embarassed almost even though she was the one making a fool of herself- or was she? I was thinking to myself it's girls like her that are giving girls slutty reps more and more as the years go by. Then I had to stop myself and take a good look at me. Fine I don't make shows like that in public, in fact, I'm pretty reserved. I'm family oriented, know my limits, I'm a nice girl, I don't mean harm, but does that make me any better than that girl on the balcony considering the fact that I have cheated (kissed a guy or two but nothing more) on my ex? Do I contribute to that horrible reputation that women are getting? I don't want to be. I felt sick almost. I wasn't sure why I had done the things I did. i wanted to throw up right then and there. As i got into the car my friend looks over and repeatedly asks me if I'm ok. She tells me I'm red in the face and sweating. I told her I was fine, but really I wasn't. I didn't feel like starting to explain what I was feeling in fear that she wouldn't understand. Some things are better kept to yourself....

I made a promise a while ago that when I got a new boyfriend or got myself into a new relationship things would be totally different. I don't think I could live with that guilt again. It eats you up inside. Seeing things like last night just revive it. I wish some things could be erased."

I lost 15 pounds, got myself a nice hawaiian goldy tan, purple extensions in my hair (yes I'm a little trendy one, but the extensions was only cause i didn't wanna bleach my real hair), and lemme tell you the guys are fluffing hot hot hot.

The little time I have to myself I try to fit in some of my social life and sleep. I barely see my mother at all cause we have opposite schedules so things are great. No fighting, no yelling first thing in the morning, and she's learning to appreciate me so much more.

I went ahead and bought myself some esthetic equipment to put in my basement. I closed off a section of it with sliding curtains so that I can have a nice provate work station. I started doing some clients at home as well, and I'm slowly building a clientel. Feels good to have money in my pocket. For once I don't feel smothered, stressed or pressured to make money. I can spend it freely, but also save some of it wisely.

Next week I get my car :) Tiburon GT without the spoiler in red. Raawwwr. V6 engine, standard, but no leather :( I hjate hyundai, really I do. But honestly, for the type of car it is, It's not that expensive at all. 5 grand down, leased for a 48 month period, 275 a month. All my tips I get during the day will go to my gas and car maintenace if needed. I make about 50$ tip a day or more, and sometimes I work 6 day weeks. Once in a while you get those old Moroccan ladies that leave you a 20 dollar tip for shaping their eyebrows. Holy. I love this industry."

"event","ok so, Eric tells me he's always had feelings for me. What a freakin weird way of showing it man. He also said that he was scared of me because I'm known for serious relationships apparently?? How come I didn't know this? Is that what people say about me? I haven't been in many serious ones at all. But why be scared of that? He said it intimidates him because he's only been in one and I'm more 'experienced' and sometimes it seems like I'm 'out of his league'. Where all this came from I have no idea! Caught me by total surprise. It's Eric! I love Eric to death cause we've been friends for a while and he's always stood up for me even if our friendship has been shakey a little. He said that his moods switch really quick around me because I'm moody myself and it alters his moods. (???? am I really???) He also said that he hates hearing me talk about other guys so he pushes himself away and gives off the 'i dont give a shit' attitude. Boy oh man. 
Thing with Eric is that there's always been chemisty there. Whenever George and I broke up or went on breaks Eric and I would get closer. He'd also get pissed every time George somehow got me back (I was a moron). Regardless, he gets jealous when I'm with guys, and a part of me always feels protective of him when I know he's seeing some one.
ok, no. no no no. It's Eric. Nope. I'm gonna take a nap and sleep on this. I don't wanna deal with this right now as selfish as it seems. *sigh* Poor baby.

A part of me also wants to save him for later. Save him for when I know I really want to get serious. I haven't lost him so far as a friend, I hope he can hang on a bit longer.

So I was thinking. I wanna sign up for pottery classes. The next session starts in september though so I'll do that :) In the meantime, Embroidery it is, and lots of walking.

I'm getting on with myself and blocking things out. Why should I have to dwell on something that can never fix or mend? Should I cry every single night because in all honesty I feel like shit? I can. I can play myself a sad song on the guitar while I'm at it. But why? Why should I? So I can feel worse? So I can be sad with the person I thought to be closest to me at one point and we can cry and cry and cry and both feel completely helpless? 

Resentment yes. Hostility no. How can I say something to some ones face when all I have is a phone? ""what is this relationship now? A phonecall a day?"" I've said all I have to say.

I remember I used to always see Pluto the dog. Every cloud looked like pluto. Sometimes I would see rabbits running. I looked at a cloud yesterday, but this time I saw faces of people I knew. They were all laughing and feasting. They were celebrating. I'm doing the right thing in life :)

""I have a question."" How can you feel any sympathy for somebody who put themselves in their own grim situation? I can't, anyway. I find it comical instead. I'm not cold hearted at all, don't get me wrong. It's just amusing how those people do it to themselves then try to get you to cry with them- or for them, whatever.

I went to the embroidery store today. Yes, embroidery. I'm not a dork :( I love doing it. It's a secret passion of mine. Those who know of it call me 'Gramma Jew'. So, Gramma Jew bought herself a canvas of a gorgeous victorian style woman, with a pink flowing dress, pink umbrella, dark hair up in a nice coif, standing in the middle of a market. It's absolutely beautiful. Mouna sits in my lap whenever I embroid. She tries to hook her paws onto the string and follows the needle anxiously with her wide eyes.

George called me yesterday. I knew it. I knew he couldn't go with seeing me and then not calling. I acting normal actually. Not mean, not nice, but just normal. He asked if i was seeing Jim, then was relieved when I said no. You could hear it in his voice. Joe was over when he called though. The relief in his voice quickly faded when he heard Joe's voice. ""So the line of men begins,"" he said to me. I didn't say anything. I'm having fun. I'm only 20. Life begins :)

We're still going to Orlando though, my friends and I. Man, I wanna see Disney. We're gonna gang bang with Mickey and friends *giggle*. So classy of me teehee! We're calling the agency to book our flight tomorrow. W're thinking end of July. We're gonna go for 1 week. Like hell I'm gonna cancel my trip for a guy."

Just when you think some people know you and understand you. I can let people in, but shut them out ten times faster. Am I angry? Sad? Depressed? I don't know. Hurt- yes. The only way I know how to deal with it is to build walls up around myself. And to think that I wanted to tear those down. I'm a silly girl. Even sillier to think that all this could work. *smirk* The funny part is that none of this would have even happened if I hadn't gone to Toronto. Trouble. I look at it now though and decide that it probably made me stronger. I got respect and the ability to stand up for myself out of it. 

I'd like to take this time to say, I'm single.

I'm looking forward to that tonight seeing as how I only have to be in for my stage at 10 tomorrow. If anything I'll go out for an ice cream around 9ish with Sofia and Vageli. He let me drive the escalade, it rocked. I barely touched the pedal and it went flying. Mind you he was freaking out the whole entire time cause of the potholes. Montreal sucks cause of that.

I think it's pretty much settled. A bunch of us agreed on Orlando to go to Disney. I'm so persuasive ;) Only thing now is we have to find a date that we can all go on. I think that might be the most difficult thing. Plus we have to book the hotels.

She's so curious, it's adorable. Contantly purring... makes me feel so happy that she's happy. Even after the worst conversation or the most stressful days, just holding her makes me all warm again.

Out of all the places in the whole entire world, I see my ex at the old port. Blah. I saw his new girlfriend. Well she's not that new, they've been at it for a while. As soon as he saw me he pretended like he wasn't having fun and put on the puppy dog act to make me feel guilty. Horrible thing is I'm such a fucking sap and I'm way too nice, so yes I felt a tinge of guilt for being so mean to him. Didn't regret breaking up with him though. Lord I didn't regret that. I could just picture myself being one of those girls sitting down at the table and having to hear about, ""this diesel top costs this much, and this gucci shirt costs this much, and I got these armani jeans on sale for.."", plus all their prejudice jokes. But you know, the girls seemed to be having fun. Loud, obnoxious, jumping around everywhere, tatoos all over the place, ex barmaids- basically everything he said he hated in girls. I don't feel so bad anymore. He'll never have any concept of what he's lost. Nor will he ever change. Spending habits, superficial conversation, deceit, prejudist, and of course immature. So why am I so blahish? I know I could do better, and I have done better and I'm ecstatic about it. What's my problem?

Sofia has been a really good friend to me lately... she's changed a lot too. She's woken up to the reality of this disgusting world. Not as naeve as she used to be, nor as shallow. We can have conversations now. Before was all giggles and me stating opinions with her not really having one. A shrug of the shoulders or a nod and that was it. Funny thing is that I used to never be able to spend more than a coupel of hours with her, but now it's like I can't get enough of her. I mean, she's really been there for me, calling me every day since i got back from Toronto making sure I was ok, canceling her saturday night plans to go for ice cream with me, and introducing me to loads of really really nice, smart, outgoing people. I slowly feel myself coming to life. It makes me cry..."

I've been going to bed early only to read more crap from textbooks and highlight like a madman. Liv would appreciate the highlighting system with me. It should be a common code. Everyone should follow it. *beams* But anyway, it's all over now. The week from hell is GONE. I don't have to see that school for two whole weeks because I start my stage on tuesday. *collapses*
In a way I'm kind of happy that Jim and I have had a lot of time on our own this week because I know that I wouldn't have been able to do everything. I'd want to talk to him instead and would have procrastinated further.

Today I had the last of all the junkfood I could possibly eat. I start weight watchers tomorrow woohoo! Tonight I go to my first meeting since I signed up. yesterday I went to get weighed and lord- it's pretty bad. 

I'm gonna go buy myself some rollerblades sometime this week since the weather is gorgeous. I've got to find myself a partner to go down to the lake with and rollerblade on the path. I know Bree is in for the summer and she's good at it. I should ask what her schedule is like. eh. She'll have a ball laughing at me cause I'm such a clutz. Do I put myself up for the embarassment? hah :D Actually I'm not bad. The first 10 minutes is usually rusty then I pick it up again.

So I went to the psych. She said, ""oh boy... wow... we have lots to talk about."" I'm booked again for tuesday night. She said I was a pack of nerves. I didn't cry though- yet. I think it was because my switch is on the optimistic mood. Tomorrow it may change. I'm weird like that.

Tonight I'm gonna go see Daddy Daycare with Joe and his friend Gratz probably. They invited me to go. We have the same silly sense of humour so the movie should be fun.

She tipped it over and when I came down this morning it was all over my keyboard, speakers, and floor. I flipped. I took one look at her and she slowly started to back away ever so gently and quietly. Ugh, it was no use, I couldn't get mad at her. She's a pest though! My gosh, what a character and a half. She's so precious though- eeeee!!!!!!!!

Holy! I'm so happy! A really old friend of mine, Joey, called me last night. I hadn't spoken to him in yyyyrrrrrrrrrrsssssss! We must have spoke for hours just catching up and filling eachother in on gossip. haha, it was fun. I usually hate gossip but for some reason only Joe could bring that out in me. He's such a gossipper himself but he's totally straight I swear. He's in his last year of journalism at Concordia and has already been offered a job as a sports broadcaster. I'm so proud of him! I know he's always wanted to be in front of the camera. He's so made for it. He makes you piss your pants laughing. He was with the same agency as I was a couple of years back before they closed and turned into a casting agency with a different name. Ever since neither of us really put the effort forth in trying and going back for auditions. We made a deal that we would both find an agency, the same one, and push eachother to go and encourage eachother. God it's always been a dream of mine but I just put it away cause it seems like it could never happen... I left it as only a dream. I'd love to try it again though. We also came to find out that we're both writing books, and when explaining them we decided that if they were mixed together it would make for one hell of a script/story. So we're gonna try to belnd both stories together and send it in to get it reviewed. We'd split the costs. This is so exciting! I missed having such a good friend!

Eric finally snapped out of his, i-got-dumped-and-i-dont-need-anybody mode. We went for coffee us two and Sofia last night after I went to weight watchers. I tried the most amazing drink. It's a half iced tea and half lemonade but it's kind of slushy. I can't explain it. There were fresh cut fruits in it. Yummy! We decided we would make this coffee thing a ritual. I can't wait to start the diet. Plus now I can go to the gym more often now that my stomach is somewhat under control. It's pretty evident that my stomach pains are due to stress. I had them almost the whole time in Toronto and at Mel's. But since I've come back home and I've 'tried' my hardest to get along with my mother which is going ok so far (knock on wood), It hasn't been hurting me much at all. The doctor was thinking of giving me stress relief pills to see how it goes and cut all the other pills and syrups.

I'm so glad... everyone told me I did the right thing by going back home. Even those that live on their own already. They could tell I wasn't emotionally and financially ready for it, but they also didn't have a doubt that I could make it when I got things sorted out and decided what I'm gonna do with myself. I hope things continue to go good... All I think I need is really good company nowadays, and tons of support. I have my first psych appointment this afternoon :) I called in this morning and there was a cancellation, woohoo! It's a sign! *giggle*"

I can't explain this... It just sucks that in the past couple of weeks all the people that are dear to me have pushed me away. I think it is me. I just don't know what I do yet. I don't think I'm perfect... in fact I think I'm way far from perfect but people have trouble seeing their own faults. I know I'm full of them though. 
I just have this bad feeling. It's like he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, he's dissappointed at me for being where I am, and it feels like he gave up on me or something... I always told myself that those who give up on me don't really know me and don't want to put the effort into getting to know me or my deepest thoughts- but I do want him to know me. I do want to share things with him. I want to share those thoughts that I can't tell anyone else... but unfortunately he all of a sudden doesn't want to share thoughts unless we can formulate a conclusion from them and where we'd both get something out of it. He never used to be like that... It's like I can't even enjoy telling him the smallest thing that's on my mind because he wouldn't get anything out of it. I'm just, ugh, *cry*, i don't know.
I'm so fed up of crying these past weeks. You'd think I'd be numb to it. I let him see me cry in Toronto. I never let anyone see me cry. I also told him words that I promised I wouldn't tell anyone until I was absolutely certain and sure that I'd be somewhere with them later on. I jsut don't learn to keep thoughts to myself. I don't mean to take it back at all... i know how I felt and what I felt, but if things crumbled to the ground right now I'd be so mad at myself for expressing my feelings too soon.

I guess it's just hard for people to understand that I come from a really fucking strict family. I was never allowed to do A THING. Whatever I did to get to toronto believe you me was completely and totally frowned upon. The smart sweet girl now looks like a reckless liar. I know i shouldn't care what they think of me but deep down despite all I can't just get rid of all family value. Sure there are tons of things I want to do and will have trouble doing it but I'll push for it and eventually get my way. But I don't want to do it this way. I don't want to do it by lying. I also don't want to put my rents in complete shock when I do things they dissaprove of. I want there to be a compromise somewhere and I'm aware that it'll take a lot to do it.

I guess some people just don't understand this and no matter what I do I'll just be looked at as dependent and immature to them. I hate hurting people... and as irational as my family is I hate hurting them too. I just wish they could understand sometimes... I know all of this frustrates Jim. I wanted to tell parts of this to him on the phone last night but I didn't bother. He'd just ask me why I cared so much. I just always feel so little compared to him- like a dependent baby. I feel like he looks at me that way...

I don't know if I'm ready to move out on my own just yet. In a couple of months I would be. When I was actually able to save some money and find a decent roommate and apartment. I know I know, what's a couple of months? You know what- it's a whole fucking lot. People don't realize how much happens in just one month. 
Mel is cool and all but holy. The apartment is a disaster, I feel so choked up inside. Ok, sure I'm a smoker, but I hate smoking in the apartment, and the whole place reaks cause she's a chain smoker. She barely cleans, she's pregnant, her bf deals coke, and i'm terrified that one day he'll bring the wrong kind of trouble to the apartment. I even hated my kitten staying there. I was worried social services would take it away from me hehehe. eh. ok.

I'm at my mom's now. I was invited for supper last night, but since we have to go shopping tomorrow for this first communion, and saturday is the first comunion, and sunday is mother's day, then i'm just sleeping here till sunday. it feels awkward mind you. She's trying a bit too hard to be nice. I hate that. I'm doing most of this for my gramma really. I do kind of miss my mom though. She even said she would go see a psych and admitted she was a very unhappy person. That was a step up. *sigh*

I'm confused. Should I just go home for the time being, patch things up normally, save money and actually get myself a job, find a good roomie and apartment, then move out? I don't feel like I'm ready to take on all of this at the present moment. I do want it bad, really bad believe me, but I'm not willing to choke myself and put myself in such a strainous position to have it.

ok this is an essay.. i'll stop now..."

If only I was able to avoid it all,
If only life was sweet like roses,

Who would have thought that things would get complicated?
Who would have thought I couldn't avoid a thing?
Who would have thought that life could be so shitty?
I hate twenty.
But maybe it's all just momentary..."

"event","so our internet suddenly doesn't work. The computer is a piece of crap and a half. Worst part about it is that my mom won't let me take MY OWN computer which is brand spanking new- nevermind, she won't even let me take my bed. Nice huh. Anyways. 
God I've been so depressed lately. It's horrible. I laugh so hard with everyone else and then suddenly I'm crying. Everyones looking at me like I'm psychotic. Everything seems so impossible nowadays. I feel shocked. Like a tropical fish dropped in a cold lake.
I got a kitten though... I wanted some comfort. She looks exactly like a leopard. She's so precious. I named her Mouna. I just wanna eat her up sometimes she's adorable.
*sigh* Jim... I feel horrible. I feel so bad that he has to listen to my constant problems. I know he has some of his own.. I feel so selfish. I just wish he were here *cry*. I mean, I don't know how I'm supposed to manage a way to see him.... if I get a new job they'll never give me the time off for that. I just feel so bombarded with a million things to do and so much pressure to do them. School, work, making money, finding a place to stay for august, and seeing the person that means the most to me right now. I feel so fucking stress I'm gonna crack.
I stood in the bathroom for an hour this morning staring in the mirror. I'm starting to hate it even more everyday. I just wanna hide all the mirrors.

I probably won't write for a while...
I feel like I need to say a prayer but I don't know who to say it to. I can't explain this.

bye for now"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ok. that's it I think.

My current situation:

I basically got booted out of my house cause i'm some reckless twenty year old apparently or something along those lines. I have 500$ to my name. I moved in with my friend Mel and her 2 other roommates for a couple of months until her two other roomies move out in august so we can find a nicer place. 

Things I have to do FAST:

-Get a job.
-Talk to my teacher about all the hours I've missed and see if -she'll let me make up for it- she's not that understanding.
-Make a key for the appartment.
-Go GROCERY shopping (that was for Jim).
-Get the rest of my shit from my house when my mother isn't putting me under quarantine. *has a coughing fit* YOU ALL HAVE SARS NOW.
-Finally find the time and money to get to Jim which will probably be the most pleasurable and motivating thing in all of this :)


THE GOOD STUFF:

Jim... Jim... Jim... *dreamy sigh* I woke up to him every morning you know. It kills me that I woke up today staring at my striped sock :/ I don't think I've ever felt so comfortable with some one right off the bat... Sure there were times that I was self conscious of my body... but he seemed to like it and not to mind. His eyes are gorgeous.. oh my. I could get lost in them- I did a couple of times... he caught me by asking ""what's wrong?"". Nothing was wrong :) Nothing was wrong at all... in fact everything was perfect. It couldn't have been more perfect... I just wish that we would have had more time. Marcus said something to me though that was true... He said that no matter how much time you have it will always go by just as fast. He and Liv have been together for 4 yrs. 4 yrs! Just goes to show how fast time flies and it sucks. 

He's just beautiful. I don't think there's a more perfect word...


I saw Liv and FINALLY met Marcus too! They were such great hosts and are honestly two of the most amazing people I know... the simple things keep them happy. We should all be like that."

"event","I'll tell you exactly where my stress derives from. REALITY TV SHOWS. HOLY!. oh my.

First of all, I'd like to say that they're completely overdoing it now. Come on- now she has to choose from masked men. Which you know, is what they should have done in the beginning for all those who claimed that they were looking for 'true love' and not just a pretty face. BUT, it's kind of ridiculous. What's next? Interviews in the complete dark?

Anyway. I waited the whole entire show to see number 17's face because he seems to be the most intriguing by far. He's a motivational speaker and a smart little fucker cause he's using his psychology to reel her in and it's so working. It's funny cause he explains his theories and how they work before he uses them on her lol. She does exactly what he says she will. It kills me lol. So, just when they're about to show his face my mother starts nagging at me AND I MISS IT. THIS IS GOING TO KILL MEEEEEEE. Now I have to wait till he either gets kicked off or she chooses him in order to see his face. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Why is it that the things that i have to do most i find to be the hardest things to put my mind towards doing. Not that its always only my fault. But still its hard to get my mind set  to do what i need to. Today Im going to have to go into work and get my schedule fixed, because its not right for next week. I need off tues-fri during the day so i can set up an appointment at FAU. Because if i dont get into school, im screwed. But even when i do that its still not gonna be easy for me. I wish i knew more about what i was doing. Im basically jumping into this blindly. And it scares me because i still dont know what im doning exactly. I wish i was as smart as some of the poeple that i know. I wish i could find things like this easy like they do. But im not. So i have to do things the tough way. I just hope that i end up doing everything right. Maybe ill mix up my schedules for today and tomorrow so i can get things more sorted out before i give a call to them and make an appointment to see them."

"event","Thursday will be another year that i can check off. A year older a year wiser as they say. Not like i feel much wiser. Im gonna be 19, yet when i look at it i dont even feel like i should be. Where have i come in these 19 years. Not far i would have to say. Ive watched people my whole life. Ever since i can remember i had a facination in people. I used to wonder what they were thinking all the time. Used to be curious about all the experences that they had in their heads. The things that drove them to live every day. The things that made them decide what they did. But when i look at myself now i wonder the same thing. And i dont still dont know. I cant even understand what i am thinking. All my experences should be leading me somewhere, right? But when i looka t where im headed i see nothing. Its a dark path, a path that i have to draw for myself. Its like being trapped in a kaleidoscope, only i can see myself in the middle, and all the other ""images"" are other people, people i know. I see them and me all along our own ""paths"" the paths are like highways. They are along their own highways, with their alot of things along the road, the things are experences, they are things that they have done, or that they could do, exits that they can get off on, and they are happy with what they are seeing where they are going. However looking into this kaleidoscope im in the middle and my path, my highway is barren, in fact im not even drivnig in mine, im still walking, getting to places alot slower than the other people. Its all so confusing because i really dont know what im doing with my life. I dont know where im supposed to go. I cant ask for directions even ecause there is nothing that i know of on the hirozon to get to, its like an endless desert, theres noting to get to. And it worries me. beause i know that if  i dont find out where to go soon im not going to get anywhere. Ill stay where i am at. Not moving, not looking for any other opertunities. Im afaraid that im gong to be stuck right where im at all my life. Im worried that ill never get off my ass, that ill sit ar my computer every day like i have been and waste my life away. Im afarid that ill end up like that, and watching myself do it. While i watch everyone else move along dong great things. and yet still wondering what dirves them and how they make their decisions every day. I used to think i was smart, i would look at people and think ""wow that guy is stupid, why does he have to be alive."" But now i know for sure that i am  the stupid one, im the one that dosnt know what im doing. The people i used to think were dumb are the ones that have the better jobs than me, that started driving when they were younger. They are the ones that understand how things work. I odnt. They know how to go out and get a scholarship and look at colleges. I dont. And im openly admitting it now, that that is the main reason why i am here doing nothing, and worrying. I DO NOT GET HOW ALL OF THAT STUFF WORKS. No one has ever showed me what i can do to learn. I have never been guided in the right direction. No one ever told me, ""learn this, read this or your gonna end up not knowing what your doing and then your going to watch people that are dumber than you succede where you cant."" Right now all i want is to finally feel like i know what i am doing, to feel in control of something. I dont want to be stuck in the same place that i am now later. 19 years has lead up to nothing for me. I know that im going to end up in a conversation some day where people are tallking about how great their 18th and 21st birthdays were, right now if i had a conversation about my 18th birthday, i couldnt tell you anyting that i did, honestly i dont remember it, i didnt do anything. I have spent my life doing nothing. Im finally starting to get into some things now but i still dont know what im doing. Its all new to me. And alot of it i still dont understand. And i worry about it all the time."

"event","In 2 days it will be 2 years at Publix. I still remember the first day i walked in there, i had never even been in that Publix really. Now i dont know much else besides it. The love/hate relationship that i have with that place will never stop. I hate the place because customers suck ass when they come in there, treat you like crap then push you aside like a 2 dollar whore. They just dont really care, well most of them anyway. There are the ones that make the day seem better and everything seem brighter. But you know what they are few and far between. Most of them just treat you like your nothing more than a loser, and one that dosnt even know what to do for their own job. Sometimes the other employees just pis me the hell off too. Alot of the baggers especially, dissapearing for such a long time, not being called to come up front, and then getting away with it. I always do my job. Yes, i wont lie sometimes i do take a stroll or take a longer time to do things than necessary, but i do get what i need to done. And usually i do it right away. The managers piss me off alot too. I know that most of them will ask me to do something because they know that i always say ""ok"" right away, and go and do it. I dont get how they will go to 2 other people and tey will just tell them ""no"" i mean then they just go to someone else. What kind of bull shit is that. If they want something done, it should get done by the first person that they ask to do it. Not tossed in the air for someone else to do. But then there is the other side. As in i dont know any other job that i  could jump into, and i dont want a job where i can just walk out side to get carts, and take a deep breth and say. ""Im getting paid for this, i get to walk and push carts and think and not have people bother me all the time that im here."" but i still hate it too. I dont know. I wouldnt mind another job, but i dont know what else i would do. Its not like im gonna like anything else better, cause its all work, its all the same in essence when you think about it. Guess thats really the end of my rant, but who knows, maybe ill go looking for a new job. This one does seem like too much work for not enough money."

"event","2 weeks ago i wanted to put in an entry. lol. Guess that didnt happen. Anyway for those of you who dont know, i got my liscence. I dont even remember what day it was now i think it was the thursday before the hurricane. But yea i ment to put it in here but i never got to it. Then that weekend i had off of work all weekend and spent it with Chelsey, the 23rd was 1 month. We spent time at her house pretty much did nothing. But it was good. Then Monday rolled around and the hurricane Knocked out the power from about 8:30 on monday morning till thursday night at 11:45. But everyone is all right, and thats what counts. Yea i got sick though tuesday after the hurricane and i just cant seem to get rid of it. Im really thinking its a sinus infection atm. I am starting to feel better over the past 2 days though so i should be better soon."

"event","Yea so im really debating on if i want to go into work today. Cause honestly i dont feel so well. Whatever my brother had he gave it to me a bit i guess, cause i have the whole scratchy throat thing like he did. But it killed my energy, that might be why i was just so damn lazy last night. I was lying on the bed and just didnt want to move at all. Even though i still had to brush my teeth and put on lotion for my stupid skin. But yea anyway i think if i do go im gonna feel like crap there, cause i have to walk the whole way. And also i still dont know what would be up with tonight, cause now im pretty sure my brother isnt going to work tonight. And i dont know if my parents will take me over to Chelseys house or what if i didnt go to work. I need to fucking drive. Cause if i do and i do even feel ok throughout the day im gonna be whiped for tonight and i really really dont want to end up at the ice skating rink only to not wanna skate, cause i really do. =) I really think im just gonna call in, tell them i have no energy and that im gonna rest and hopefully be good for opening tom'w. So yea, i guess that that might be the best corse of action."

"event","Got work in a little bit, no suprise there really. Have to walk again, since i dont have a ride. I called the driving school, have to set up an appointment for next week  when i find out my shcedule tonight. Hopefully ill only need 1 or 2 lessons. Then they can take me in for the test. The car i was looking at is apparently sold or removed from the internet. So i gotta look some more. Every day that i walk to work though i stand at the corner across from the Publix (on Coral Ridge) and think ""how many days have i stood here, waiting for this stupid light, how many days Craig. I need to drive."" But it all looks like its coming together, shouldnt be too bad from here on in. Get to see Chelsey later &hearts;. That always brightens my day, dont know how long ima get to spend there but any time is better than no time. Again i need to fucking drive. Did some wash for work, opened the dryer though and there were clothes in there, also there were some in the washer, still wet. But the clothes in the dryer smelled like shit. I dont know what someone did but they fucked up pretty bad. I actually cleaned out the dryer with some Lysol before i used it, but i had some clothes in that batch, and i dont want to get them back smelling like that. God i wish that everyone could just fucking do things right. I stayed up so late last night too. 5:30 about. Sat up on lineage for too long, didnt take my shower till ~4 then hung out around Ventrilo using the TTS in the chat for fun. Things are so damn funny when your tired. I dont know why but they just are. One of the guys was getting all these quotes though, they were pretty good, i wish he told me where he got them from. Ill have to ask him today, i kept one in Ctrl+c lets see if i pasted over it ""The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done."" Pretty funny. Alot of it was very smart though. I like stuff like that. I thought up one, ""The only reason i think outside of the box is because i kicked it away......... But its cold and alone out here."" Dunno maybe its actually stupider than i think but whatever. Ok gotta go check on my drying clothes. More to come when i get home i guess. Depends on my mood/ what time i get home tonight. Ha i just noticed too, the journal says the time is 11:57, guess thats when i started this, its 12:13 now. Man i dont want to go to work, i hope it goes fast. I know ill be thinking about getting out of there and over to Chelseys all damn day."

"event","well, finally decided to start a tumblr-blog. basically a replacement for gmail status where i normally post random pics and links. this will make looking bak for old links hopefully easier as well as not having to change the status over and over.

looking to create a stylesheet/css from semi-scratch for the tumblr page.. but 1st.. just get it started and fig out the mechanics.

"event","went up to big bear mountain a 2nd time with tom, sophia, and louise this sunday. this time went to the bear mountain side whereas last week went to snow summit.

the drive up the mountain was pretty smooth, though sophia kept getting freaked out by tom's driving.. hahaha. managed to actually get louise's rental and our lift tickets before the park officially opened. did a couple runs on the bear mountain express. man... all the trails have some sort of park feature.. boxes, rails, half-pipe. wasnt expecting that so had to stay sharp to avoid them.

met up with tom and sophia's friends then split up with louise, sophia, and me going off to do our own thing since we werent as adept. did another run down the bear mt express before deciding to go to the easier slope side. gah.. forgot how bad the slow easy areas can be.. no momentum on the flat parts.. and the number of falling and sitting skiers/boarders makes it very hard to find a clear path down. 

fed up, we went bak to the other side. this time, we navigated horizontally after getting off the top of the lift. managed to work our way over to the silver connection trail which was just steep enough and open enough for us. decided to practice toe edge as louise and i have never actually gotten the hang of it. leafing down on toe edge, i started to get the feel of it. switched to heel, then bak to toe, and again... blam... before i knew it.. i was carving down the trail! wheee... didnt want to stop or i might not keep up the rhythm, i just carved my way down all the way till the bottom.. haha.. finally! managed to carve a good distance. now hopefully i can remember how to do it again...

tried to sale our tickets but both tom and i got caught.. hehe.. they took me to an office and gave me a schpeel then a warning and a temporary ban from the bear mountain for 2 weeks. good thing i wasnt planning a trip up to big bear again the next couple weeks.

dropped off louise's rentals and bought some stuff from a nearby liquor store. got an energy bar to fill my stomach while sophia bought the entire store... heh.. naw.. she got 2 bags of chips, 2 ice cream bars, and 2 ramen bowls.. + who knows what else... the drive down the mountain was hell. took us around 2.5 hrs to just get down to the base. to pass the time, we were singing disney songs on the top of our lungs and cracking jokes.. or freaking out at tom's driving if u were sophia. at least we werent like the rest of tom's friends that decided to stay til 3pm... they didnt get home till 10pm oO"

"event","whew... action packed weekend.. or at least thats what it felt like.

had relatives and family friends over for dinner on friday and caught up with my cousin Tony.
Ralph and Tina flew down from the bay area and were going to crash at our place. Dragged them along to Ray's, round 11pm, where we met up with Thy and force fed spades into Ralph and Tina. Finally crashed and burned around 2am

Went to eat a Cafe Hiro on Sat. Sorry Louise, no Jidori Chicken Lunch Special. Ralph and Tina then left to their friend's bachelor party. 
Louise and I drove around lookin for the final ingredients to my costume for Christine's birthday costume party. Searched 5 stories before we found chocolate gold coins. Assembled our costumes, picked up Tiffany, and drove to Christine's place in Santa Monica.

I changed into my Michael Phelps costume (swim cap, jammers, goggles, and 9 medals) and mingled. Food was pretty good, homemade risotto, lamb chops, bloody mary shrimp cocktail, and bruschetta with bacon. Christine had also set up a chocolate fondue with fruits, cake, and marshmallows. Hung out for a while before bookin for home around 10:30pm. Went to bed as soon as Ralph and Tina came bak as we had to get up early.

Left for Santa Monica Beach Sunday morning and met up with our surfing instructor, Sergio. He 1st taught us the basics of body position on the board, paddling, ducking waves (push up, turtling!), and POP! Then we took the foam boards into the water. Damn it was cold! Although the wetsuit kept my body warm, my hands and feet basically went numb... 

With the instructor's help, I managed to catch and ride 3 waves. The board is a lot more stable than I thought. Just gotta keep my body centered over the middle when i get up and stand. I also caught a wave by myself.. though it took like 10 failed attempts. Overall, it was alot of fun and just catching waves was exciting.

Was going to go lunch with Christine and her friends, but we were on a tight schedule and Rosco's Chicken and Waffles had an hour wait. So the rest of us decided to go to Farmer's Market, except we took the wrong way and ended up deciding to go home. 

Dropped Thy off then went to a Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant near our place. Ordered a bunch of food, oyster pancake, green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, stir fried shanghai style rice cake, pork chop rice, and small basket dumplings.

Ralph and Tina left to meet up with friends, while we bummed around at home feeling tired. Dad cooked and we had dinner at home with Thy, Ralph, Tina, and the family. Placed some spades then dropped Thy off at Tom's and we went to Guppy's

Got some taro shaved ice, strawberry mango shaved ice, and popcorn chicken cuz they were out of gizzards. Wasnt bad, same ol from Guppy's but the service was horrendous. not much people, lots of staff, and we didnt get our drinks and water until we were about to leave.

Went to work Monday morning, Ralph and Tina left earlier to the airport, and felt the soreness. Shoulders and sides were burning, hard to lift up my arms. Still, really wanna go surfing again.. wanna catch more waves on my own."

"event","well peoples.... i be bak.. yea! ::barfs::

japan was humid and rainy. the tour was very organized and we did see alot of things but i still like exploring on my own more. i did enjoy the onsen hotel and the traditional japanese set meals that was included.. and can anyone dare say we didnt rock in karaoke? 

visited a bunch of historic sites; a few while being rained upon. the rain did not help in cooling off the weather very much. also had some ""free time"" to roam around the city. went to kanidoraku? a crab restaurant.. expensive but oh so delicious. very fun overall in japan, great food and uniqlo.... guess the only thing was.. didnt really feel like i was in japan.. prob due to only spending ~5 days there and being on a tour.

taiwan was hot and humid.. man was it stifling the nite we flew in. felt like the stay in taiwan was a lot shorter than in japan.. maybe cuz i could actually understand the language and get around on my own. our new condo there is nice! bigger than i'd expected and close to some of the big shoppin areas. mainly hung out with the hungs.. (haha) and met up with relatives. 

my grandfather's b-day dinner was huge... im guessing 100+ people attended. performance went off better than expected.. but the hot lights and the fact that the strings on my borrowed cello were slippin didnt help. saw and talked to a bunch of relatives i've havent seen in a while and had some general tomfoolery during the meal and events.

ditched the hungs (damn u ray) & vo/tsai and went with the family up to taiping mountain. fresh, cool, refreshing (pocari sweat! jk) nice change from the city weather. really enjoyed just looking out at the greenery and at the mountain ranges. gotta love the different shades of purple/gray of each mountain going into the distance. went to a hot springs on the mountain.. haha.. water wasnt that hot but the place was nice. 2 big pool areas with shallow hot water.. but the main draw were the large stones carved and hollowed out like large cups filled with the hot spring water.. fun times.

too bad i only had a week in taiwan... was just getting acclimated and into the groove of things there when it was time to leave. imma miss the food, eps the places we couldnt hit, and just the general ease of getting around on buses, monorail, and walkin. actually had a thought that it would we nice if i could live in taiwan for an extended period of time.

took lots of pics, mainly in japan... dunno when we'll get around to compiling and organizing them..."

"event","hmm.. y cant there be a steepandcheap or whiskeymilitia clone but for paddling/rowing?

i wonder how difficult it would be to get suppliers lined up.. searchin for dragonboat or paddling related items online is like a shot in the dark. there are plenty of sellers, just disorganized and really really really bad websites and online store designs. 
seems like alot of the sellers are small and dont really know how to create an effective online store. 

it would be great to have a more centralized online shop for those items. either an online site dedicated to paddling and/or water sports or have a bigger outdoors site ala backcountryoutlet carry more watersports related items.

would really love to get all those different dragon boating specific equipment together in a central site. hell, 12 years into the sport and we're still askin.. um.. where get paddles? wat type? gloves? buttpads? etc."

anyways,

so what have i been up to...
with parents outta town.. been keeping track of the bills x.x, ""planning"" meals..., and tryin to keep up motivation for resume updating, gmat studyin, and from just plain laziness.

been working out with louise and thy on this one exercise routine. basically weights every other day and cardio 5-6 times a week. 3 weeks into it.. and must say.. i do feel like i've toned up a bit.

got the <a href=http://www.iriverinc.com/prod/ultra/clix/"">iriver clix 2 4gb media player</a> over the weekend. it was smaller than i expected but damn the screen looks good. i also like the ""D-Click"" interface.. basically clicking the front sides of the clix2 to navigate around the menus.

only drawbacks so far is that the screen could be a bit bigger (2.2in currently) and that the glossy finish of the front picks up fingerprints like flies to the blue zapper thingy. 

still, the crispness and brightness of the screen makes up for the small size and hey, im really gonna be using it more for music than for videos anyways. i also ordered a shield protector from Best Shield Ever, basically a clear, thin, strong material that wraps around the clix2. hopefully it'd keep my iriver from scratching and picking up fingerprints.

well, my sony behind-the-head headphones died recently.. RIP. and so, tryin to find a replacement. grado? yamaha? shure? sony? audio technica? sennheiser? bleh.. too many...

grado - s60/s80 - great sound/designed for music listening but open so sound leaks in/out dunno if good for travel

yamaha - rh5ma - professional usage, great sound but pro = good music listening?

shure - se530 - one of the best in-ear buds but expensive ($400+) and.. im not really into in-ear buds

sony - MDR7506 - professional usage, great sound but pro = good music listening?

audio technica - ATHA700/900 - great sound and closed but a bit pricey ($150+) and bulkier

sennheiser - PX100/200 - good sound and decently priced but an open headphone (though that may not be so bad)

so yeah.. cant really decide.. though i think i'd go with either audio technica or sennheiser with the sennheiser lookin more attractive cuz of its price."

"event","went to watch the mighty mighty bosstones' concert at the avalon theater in la on saturday. ""rushed"" in with louise's friends, christine and chris, to get to the front of the stage.

the two opening bands were quite good. the pietasters sounded like a smaller version of the bosstones while the street dogs had a more rock sound. i personally enjoyed the street dogs quite a bit, more my type of music.

then after a eternity of waiting, the mighty mighty bosstones took the stage. wow, the crowd's reaction was crazy. while they looked like one of those old big bands/swing bands, the sound that the bosstones put out bordered between heavy jazz and hardcore punk.. hence.. ska punk. while i knew only about 10% of the songs, it was still very exciting to be in the middle of it. ears were still ringing the next morning. =P

even being near the front of the stage was like being chest deep in the ocean. the crowd surged and crushed against each other during the entire set. while 1/2 of me was enjoyin the performance, the other 1/2 was jostling and fighting with other people that wanted to force their way to the front. i used every basketball boxing out technique, subway/monorail standing balance skills, and just plain stubbornness to keep from getting edged out.

BOSSTONES!

3. get lyrics - shouldnt be too hard...
4. remove audio from MVs/PVs - not hard.. esp with virtual dub
5. create/time karaoke subtitles - this i need to learn
6. add/time karaoke subtitles to MVs/PVs - also need to learn

And on a more random note, something i found while reading comments on a site:
----
Larry was in trouble. He forgot his wedding anniversary.
His wife was really angry.

She told him ""Tomorrow morning, I expect to find a gift in the driveway that goes from 0 to 200 in less then 6 seconds? AND IT BETTER BE THERE!!""

The next morning Larry got up early and left for work.

When his wife woke up, she looked out the window and sure enough there was a box gift - wrapped in the middle of the driveway.

Confused, the wife put on her robe and ran out to the driveway, brought the box back in the house.

She opened it and found a brand new bathroom scale.

Larry has been missing since Friday.

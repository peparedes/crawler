"event","for the first time in years i'm truely happy, not faking it to make someone else feel better. i feel like i'm a kid again. it's a little scary, i'm not used to it. i don't know how it happened, so don't ask. 

ok, enough being giddy. hehe

lexi needs to come back from up north. even though when she gets back i won't be able to see her or really talk to her until next weekend, but i want to tell her what's been going on. make her jealous for once. 

in the last couple weeks things have been going pretty well. minus the heat and the migranes, but i'm getting used to both of them again. texted with stefy d a couple times (sorry about dave honey, it'll work out), found someone who likes me for me, finished up my business out of town, found a kitten i want but i can't have (1, it's been claimed, 2, it'll kill me), thunderstorm today :), been getting out of the house more, haven't screwed up any relationships, and last but not least, it was shark week on the discovery channel!

downsides: saw ian buy condoms (no good for all involved), i know too many people in this town, getting sick of living in ghetto-ville, still have no money.

KAREN!!! i still can't find any postcards. well, not the one i want to send you anyway. but i'm also enjoying our random bits of information shared here in journalland. trust me, i won't forget that you have guy stories to share. i'll email you a picture of jeff, maybe, if you're nice. i'll keep an eye our for your shoes at target. i don't know how productive that'll be since i don't really have any money to buy them for you, but i'll look anyway. you should be proud. i only gone to ikea once since the last time i went with you and that was with my dad to show him around. we only spent 30 minutes there and didn't buy a damn thing. i was proud of myself but also slightly disappointed.

for the next couple weeks it looks like i'll be busy. doing my usual work around here as well as sorting my school stuff and packing. spending time with the friends, new and old. hopefully spending a lot more time with jeff. i was so excited to be getting close to going back to school, but now i don't want to. i want to see all the kids from school, but i want to stay here. who cares about classes. 

thinking about starting a myspace account. not sure. i don't even keep up with this half the time. unless no one is online and i'm bored.


all in all, now i'm having fun and i'm happy and i don't want it to end. but, i'm not going to let that get me down."

"event","so life around here is slightly uneventful. even though i don't have a summer job i manage to keep busy around the house. it's not fun work and i feel like cinderella without the perks (the man, the dress, the shoes, the fairy god mother to grant me wishes and stuff) but i do get food and i get to spend time with the dog. i miss that. she always makes me feel better. i know most of you don't understand that but it's true. she always knows when i'm in a bad mood and knows how to cheer me up most of the time. 

last weekend my dad and i helped my cousin put together his grill. i got to go swimming with him and his son. lukie. he's so cute. especially when he 'elmo-cizes' with a white castle hambuger in his hand and sings about it. the next day we went to a cookoff at my cousin's house where he and his brothers competed for bragging rights for b-b-q. it was interesting. personally, i didn't like most of the food. except the shrimp salad i made. it was good shit. and i won an award for it, even though they didn't have a plaque for it like the bbq awards. oh well. i didn't expect to win anything. it was cool though.

this week has been mundane so far. it's thursday. but tomorrow is a day with lexi. haven't had one of those just having fun days in a while. since we went to valley fair. it should be good as long as we can avoid the heat. don't know what we're going to do yet. we never do. 

today was not a fun day. i knew it was coming, i broke out, and just started to feel shitty in gerneral. but i didn't really prep myself. oh well. it'll be over soon. 

most of my stress is gone. now i just have boy stress. i don't know what to do about him. there isn't enough there to date him. i'm really not interested. but he treats me nice and that doesn't happen. plus he likes me and that REALLY doesn't happen. i'll give it another weeks thought and see if anything happens. if not then it's over., before it really began. that's ok though. it just doesn't feel right. but i'm not a person to break a heart. he's sweet. i can't do that. 

seriously, someone slap me and tell me what to do. it's too hard.
it shouldn't be. i know what i want to do and i know what i should do but i can't do it. 
i guess i'm just that kind of a person. 
i try to ignore him and see if he'll get the hint, but he doesn't.
his calls become more frequent and i have to pick up the phone cause he leaves messages.
then i feel bad.
he always makes me laugh.
i haven't laughed in a while.
he compliments me.
no one does that to me.
i don't understand.
i tell him he's lying cause that's what i feel he's doing.
he says no and sounds sincere.
i don't know what to do.
i miss being treated like this.
it's been way too long
but that's no reason to get into a relationship

so i guess there was a little more than i thought to report. i wasn't planning on talking about him. but i guess i did. if you have suggestions, let me know."

"event","last night was comical. we ended up at don's house for a swim. drinks were everywhere and so were the 5 of us. minds were in the gutter and still haven't come back out. had some new experiences. won't go into details. 

colleen, i love ya child. you crack me up. the midnight run to taco bell was great. i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. 'what's that big building in front of us?' 'the library' 'it doesn't look like a library, looks like a ymca, like it should have a pool' later, on the second pass, 'hey, we must be getting close, there's the community center'. oh colleen, my overly intoxicated friend. you're the best!

this morning i woke up to a cat rubbing herself all over me and trying to kill me. all i could think was 'oh god, i'm being rubbed. by a cat, a female cat... proves my point. and i'm going to die. my meds are under missy downstairs. i don't want to go in there. things my be happening that i don't want to see. where am i? oh right, in a friend's parents' bed. oh jeez, i'm going to die in a friend's parents' bed. it's only 7, no one will find me for at least another 2 hours... oh god.'

but i had fun. it was a good night. some unexpected things happened that i thought never would.

alright, time to get some more sleep"

"event","lexi and i went to valley fair yesterday. it was a blast. haven't been there since like 7th grade when we used to go with school. i haven't been on an actual roller coaster (except the new one in the mall of america) in such a long time. we went on all the roller coasters except the corkscrew because the heat started to get the best of us. it was 97 when we were there. needless to say we spent over an hour in the waterpark. it was fun being able to be a kid again. i put sunscreen on my shoulders and on my front but i forgot to have lexi put some on my back. i got burnt again. it's ok though, not as bad as she is. it was the first time i went on steel venom. good ride!!! i didn't think i'd be able to do it after wild thing, but i did. it actually made me feel better. minus the part where i thought i was going to fall out. but we had fun and that's all that matters. it was an expensive trip but well worth it for the fun and the sun.

tomorrow i'm going out with the 'gang'. i don't know who all is going or where we're going but it should be a good time. haven't spent much time with those guys since we all got home.

there are lots of things i'm looking forward to this summer. most of which are things i haven't gotten a chance to do in years. or things that i've never tried. ;)"

"event","1. when i go in i might cause pain. i cause you to spit and ask you not to swallow. i can fill your hole. what am i?

2. a finger goes in me. you fiddle with me when you're bored. the best man always has me first. what am i?

3. i'm spread before i'm eaten. your tongue gets me off. people sometimes lick my nuts. what am i?

4. i go in hard. i come out soft. you blow me hard. what am i?

5. all day long, it's in and out. i discharge loads from my shaft. both men and women go down on me. what am i?

6. i come in many sizes. when i'm not well, i drip. when you blow me, you feel good. what am i?

7. if i miss, i hit your bush. it's my job to stuff your box. when i come, it's news. what am i?

8. i offer protection. i get the finger 10 times. you use your fingers to get me off. what am i?

9. i assist and erection. sometimes big balls hang from me. i'm called a big swinger. what am i?

10. this useful tool is commonly found in the range of 6 inches long - the functioning of which is enjoyed by members of both sexes, it is usually found hung, dangling loosely, ready for instant action. it boasts a clump of little hairy things at one end and a small hole on the other. in use, it is quickly inserted, almost always willingly, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, into a warm, fleshy, moist opening where it is thrust in and drawn out again and again many timesin succession, often quickly and accompanied by squirming bodily movements. anyone found listening will surely recognize the rhythmic, pulsing sound, resulting from the well lubricated movements. when finally withdrawn, it leaves behind a juicy, frothy, sticky white substance, some of which will need cleaning from the outer surfaces of the opening and some from its long glistening shaft. after everything is done and the flowing and cleansing liquids have ceased emanating, it is returned to its freely hanging state or rest, ready for yet another bit of action, hopefully reaching its bristling climax twice or three times a day, but much often less. what is it?







alright kids, did you figure out what the 10 things are? did your mind get stuck in the gutter?

"event","so i'm at the desk and i was productive for about the first couple hours. then i got done with everything i could do down here. now i'm bored. karen is down here talking about her extra credit. and now about how she is going to buy beer to make brats on wednesday. so i've decided i love itunes on random. it makes me laugh. i went from frank sinatra to alice cooper and now to eminem. i wonder what's next... i guess i'll have to wait and see. rammstien... interesting.

ok that's enough talk about my music. 

i'm sick and my dayquil is wearing off. this sucks. at least i only have another 15 minutes now. woohoo! 

when i get done here i'm going upstairs to finish my flasher toy with kendalin then a shower and then back to bed. 

puff the magic dragon is on now.... i've noticed that i have a lot of druggie songs on my computer. it's kinda funny. 

i think my throat is going to fall out... i'm sick of being sick and it's only been a day

so tomorrow i have class from 8 to 230 then i have to be back here by 3 to check someone out and i have class again at 4 to 540 then staff at 6 (i think) then the cac cookout at 7. looks like it's going to be another long day. i can't wait...

she better be ready to check out at 3 tomorrow, if she's not then she's getting charged for improper check out because i have to go to class. 

alright i'm done for tonight... maybe i'll type a little something up tomorrow but i doubt it.


GOOD NIGHT!!!"

"event","things this week have been crazy. i was kinda hoping that it was going to be a good week, i guess not so much. cac elections for exec board were yesterday. i really wanted the relay chair but when krystal said she did too i knew there was no way i was going to get it. she's awesome and i know that she really wanted it. so it's cool. there's always next year's elections right? stef and i decided that we are going to take over the luminaria committee for next year. it'll be good. we will get to meet a ton of cool people. i'm excited for it. it will be hard for the two of us because we have both lost family members recently and we are very emotional people when it comes to that sort of thing. 

any way. i'm in design and kendalin and i are trying to work on our toy but we don't really have what we need and we also don't have any desire to do it today. so this weekend i have to go to fleet farm and get some stuff to finish this project by tuesday. it'll be good when we get done. it's not as professional as everyone else's right now but i'm not worried. we are good decorators. it'll be fine i'm sure. 

i really don't want to be awake at the moment. this morning my phone rang at 530, i woke up and answered it, the guy sounded really creepy and it wasn't anyone i knew so i hung up and went back to bed. i layed down, fell asleep and my alarm went off seriously like a second later and it was 703. i'm still pissed about that. i don't know how it happened, but it did and now i need more sleep. 

next is drawing. i don't want to go. i hate that class. well, i just hate being there. it's a good thing that i grabbed my camera before i left. that way i can take pictures of what i need to draw next week. as long as i have 2 drawings done by tuesday i'm good. then i have an entire week to do the other 2 in the comfort of my room or the staleness of the front desk.

ummm... my design teacher just took off his shirt. more than slightly disturbing. good stuff, he's dressed now. 

this weekend should be fun. i'm going to hang out with karen. we haven't done anything in a long time. on saturday kendalin and i will be finishing our toy. sunday is the 2nd floor cookout. it should be a good time.

oh god, i almost forgot that i'm on duty tonight. that should be interesting. considering that it's the last thursday before finals start. i'm not going to tell anyone that i'm on duty. if they do anything it's their own damn fault if they get caught for it. they will get a warning, maybe, if i'm in a good mood. right now, doesn't look like i will be. my migrane is already starting and it's only 945. 

ok, i'm going to go now, i'm going to head out of here by 1030 so i can go get paper and something to eat. it's still 45 minutes away, but i don't have anything else to write. 





OH WAIT... THERE ARE ONLY 4 FULL DAYS OF CLASSES LEFT!!! i can't wait for people to go home. the floor will be quiet and the staff can have some time to themselves. 

that reminds me, we have some planning to do."

"event","thursday was our fieldtrip to minneapolis to the kathryn nash gallery, mia, and the new and very much improved walker. it was great that lexi got to go with and be a part of our class. charlie (my drawing prof.) even let her ride the bus with us. it was a blast. sometime during the day lexi decided that she wanted an ipod since she's going to europe and she doesn't want to have to take all of her cds plus batteries. once we got done wandering around the walker we left and walked the couple miles through minneapolis to her car. not as scary as many of you small town people would think. we only got offers for sex once on the way to the car. rosedale mall was interesting. that's where we decided to go for the ipod. lexi couldn't decide which one she wanted. the mini or the 20g like i have. so we went to dinner then back to the apple store. she got the silver mini. i think it was the correct decision. then it was off to north st. paul to her house so i could install it and show her how to use her ipod and her itunes. that was interesting. went to my house to see if my dad was there, nope. darby got all excited and i wanted to go in and see her but i forgot my key. on the way back to stout i fell asleep. felt kinda bad cause lexi still had to get me here and drive back home. 

friday was great. lindsey, carrie and i went to woodbury, moa, and ikea. we were looking for a formal ourfit for carrie for next weekend. we found it pretty quick. during that we decided that we would all try on some prom dresses. i found a couple cute ones, where were they when i went to prom? after all the clothes lindsey and i went on the timberland twister roller coaster. it sucked that we spent 5 bucks each for like 45 seconds of entertainment but it was well worth it. we had so much fun. i have to tell you though, it's really weird going up the first part of the roller coaster backwards. then we walked around ikea for like an hour. i love ikea. i was going to buy popcicle things, but i didn't. i don't have room in my freezer. that's ok, i'll just buy them over the summer. 

yesterday i spent a good 5 hours in linsey's room with her, justen, and bta (adam, for those of you that don't live here). we watched the incredibles while lindsey and justen covered glass lamps in incredibles pictures and red tissue paper. it was so funny watching justen get crafting lessons. then we watched finding nemo as they covered paper globes with the incredibles' logo made out of tissue paper. it was great. i miss spending time with them. it's going to be hard next year when we are all split apart. hopefully we'll be able to keep in touch though. 

today i've cleaned my room (and yes, it is mostly clean) (and my futon is up and it will stay that way for more than an hour this time) then jessi and i went to mr. movies to get a movie. we decided on the spongebob movie. don't ever watch it. it's unbelievably dumb. i'm pretty sure i lost some brain cells as we watched. it was no good. well, extreme makeover home edition is on and i have to watch it cause i'm addicted."

"event","so, this weekend is family weekend and just so happens to be RELAY FOR LIFE!!! so, today is thursday and i'm in design. next is drawing and i'm pretty sure i'm not going to stay the whole 3 hours because i don't want to and i have too much to do. after drawing i need to clean my room, work on my fashion without fabric costume (by the way, if you are planning on coming to show your support there are only 100 tickets left and they are guessing that they will sell out before the show.), then i need to do this you don't know jack thing and make signs for our program next week. sometime today or maybe tomorrow my dad is coming to get me to sign my taxes. that'll be helpful in the whole applying for financial aid thing. tomorrow i have ceramics from 8 to 10 then i'm going to go back and sleep until like noon. shower and pack for relay then leave to set up the MPR at like 2. before i leave i have to make sure my room is clean and all incriminating things are hidden or removed before my dad gets here saturday for the fashion show. looks like i'll be in the fieldhous from 2pm friday until like 9am saturday. after relay i need a shower and some sleep then i have to get ready for fashion without fabric. woohoo! i'm not so excited about that. i thought that i was done being on stage for a while. well, i guess it has been 2 years, but still... sunday i'll probably go to breakfast with my dad then back to the homework. i'll have 2 drawings to do and some minor touchups to do to 4 others. sunday i have to do my bulletin boards and door decs. it'll be interesting to see if i have everything done. oh yeah, i have to finish my paper on Citizen Kane for art history.

alright, i don't really know what to say because things are crazy and i'm not thinking so clearly. so i'm going to go...


see you all later.

"event","does it ever seem to you that your life could and should be a t.v. show? mine does. especially lately. all of my friends have some strange story to tell and i keep getting caught up in the middle of it. there are lots of things going on that i can't control and i wish i could but i know that eventually i will regain my control and things will be back to their usual hectic and disturbing ways. anyway. back to the t.v. thing... i wish that right now i could be like clarissa from clarissa explains it all or sabrina the teenage witch so that i could stop time and be able to get everything done. it would be great. then i'd clone myself so one of me could get a job and make money, one of me would go to class and do all the homework and another one (the me i am now) would be able to spend the money and have nothing but fun. oh, there would have to be another one to deal with all the shit that happens. 

alright, enough of that foolishness... cause it's never going to happen, much like everything else i hope for... 

i still haven't found anyone, is anyone surprised? i'm not, i don't have time to go out anywhere and since i don't drink, i don't go to parties. i'm never going to meet anyone and i'm starting to come to terms with that. starting... i'll never be okay with it, but i understand the reasons for it.

i am however very happy that my fashion without fabric jester outfit isn't due until next thursday. that gives me another week from today to get it done. i should be done by monday if everything goes as planned. 

this week i have gotten myself into so many things that i don't think i'll have time for them all. tonight i went to make egg rolls with dawson, karen, and lindsey. don't get me wrong, it was a blast, but i should really have been doing some work. then we had colleges against cancer. i got back here and watched lost, the first thing that i actually had planned to do for the day besides going to ceramics and signing up for my advisement meeting. when we were making egg rolls i agreed to this trivia thing with lindsey and justen tomorrow night. it'll be fun. i'm excited, really. since we are people that are completely filled with useless knowledge. NONE OF WHICH I LEARNED HERE AT STOUT!!! before i get to have fun tomorrow though, i have class from 8 to 230... it's sad that that's only 2 classes and no break... then i have to come back here and do more dpp... damn kids and their pissing on the charges that they have already. then i think i remember telling karen that we would play video games before this whole trivia thing. that'll be fun, i get to kick her ass every time. (hehehe, sorry karen, but you know it's true) friday i have ceramics again then i'll clean up the room and do laundry and work on the jester thing for awhile before i go with dawson to walmart to get paint for her office and then i'm going to help her paint it. i'm not sure what's going on on saturday. i think that's the day i will use to do the new dvd thing for wigen (i really don't understand why i'm being expected to do it this time, i volunteered last time, but i remember saying that i would do it for that one to give her an idea of what was going on...). oh, saturday i'm going to get a jumpstart on my april doordecs. since they are due the day of relay. i agreed, once again i don't know why, to go shopping with karen. i actually have a lot of fun. plus that means that i get to mix a new cd for the ride. that's exciting. too bad my limewire is screwed up or i'd be able to get new songs... but there should be something i can use in my 1009 songs in my itunes. sunday night i'm on duty and i'll probably finish my jester outfit.

hopefully i'll survive, even though as i typed it out it didn't sound like i had all that much to do. that makes me happy. 

alright, i think i've babbled enough for today. maybe i'll write more in a few days, i have to actually let something happen in my very uneventful life.


oh wait, i almost forgot. i got a new bracelet today. it's teal and says: decide to end sexual violence.    it goes nicely with my yellow livestrong and my purple hope. and i'm waiting on the pink breast cancer one.

"event","so it's been a long time since i updated this. i figure this is a good time cause i'm bored out of my mind in my 3d design class. there is still an hour left so i should do something instead of sitting here and starring blankly at the wall. i'm going home tonight, kinda excited. even though i was just there on sunday. oh well, better than being here. i guess we are leaving early, so i'll write more eventually...."

"event","Do you still walk the streets at night?
With the wandlust you fight
Back to the corner where we went our
seperate ways

Well I'd love to photograph your hand
Then shake it for a while
Cause you learn so much about someone
A brother or a swine

The veins that plough beneath your path
With so many tales to tell
A picture out of focus
In a frame where no one cares

Calm the ocean breeze
Quiet the raging sea
This stormy ship we sail
Is a bottle filled with rage

[Chorus]

Well we walked upon the railroad
Cause the train no longer ran
Where we caught a glimpse of all we missed
From the stars that filled our eyes

With a dollar in your only coat
And a fireball in your hand
You set your sails for better days
Down in South Australia

Dark though it has been
Your old spirit still shines within
These last thirteen years depraved
Of us anything that's worth sayin'

[Chorus]

So raise a cheer to those forgotten years
Back to the corner where wew went our
seperate ways

Now the carnival is goin' home
The ferris wheel is spent
For those rovin' years of endless jeers
Have dried all that was left

Calm the ocean breeze
Quiet the raging sea
This stormy ship we sail
Is a bottle filled with rage

[Chorus]"

"event","GOOD LORD! what happened to this being a place for me to 'occasionally' write down my thoughts? it's funny to see that the 4 of you all wrote down little comments that no one else really understands. amy, i'll be leaving OUR room in a few months, to my still unknown new room... it should be interesting. nikki, i miss camp. this summer we should go on parents day or something and look around. and we still have to hang out sometime before summer break. we live a mile apart and never see each other. krystal, at least i'm assuming that's who this is, i miss you too. the little warped tour run-in was interesting. how's everything going. i need details about that ring and all that is going on or went on and i wasn't invited to... and karen... i chose not to relive my near death experiences with you on our first trip to the cities. however, i'm still wondering why i agreed to go again. meh, i don't know... but you almost killed me again. 

other than that, i really don't have much to say right now. i'm trying to work on my 25 mug sketches for ceramics tomorrow then i have to clean cause lexi is coming for lunch tomorrow. it's exciting, my first visitor in a long time."

"event","been a while since i wrote last. oh well, no one reads this anyway. i just got done with my 3 hour design class followed by my 3 hour drawing class. sheesh, it's been a long day. right now i'm on my hour and a half break before my 2 hour art history class. this is what sucks about being an art student, well, one of the many things that suck, all the classes are long because they are studio and you have to have time to work. i wish they would just give me the time out side of class. anyway, not much is going on with me. when i was home for break i didn't really do anything. when i was supposed to do something with missy or lexi, something would come up like one of us got sick or something. wow, reading this i realize that i sound like a 13-year-old. that's gross. but, if you know me, this is the way i talk. all random like. this weekend i'm on duty and kinda looking forward to it. hopefully my refund will come through so that i can go shopping on my day off. but i get to see lindsey and help her out with stuff for relay and then justen (the long lost wigenite) is coming up to work on the relay posters. it'll be fun. that reminds me, i need to come up with some ideas for those. 

i still haven't found a man. it's getting kinda annoying because yet another valentine's day is fast approching and i won't have anything to do. well, i wouldn't be able to do anything anyway because i work the desk for 5 hours, but there isn't even hope. except for a secret admirer that will suprise me with flowers that day, but somehow i don't think that's going to happen. but, i'll hope for it anyway.

all i want right now is for it to be 6pm, to be back at wigne and to get mail. however, it's 3pm, i'm in msc and i don't even have an email. this sucks. meh, i'm used to it by now. at least i have my peachy-o's to comfort me.

ok, this is boring and i'm going to take a nap before class."

"event","so today in self defense we kicked some ass. we worked on how to get out of a figure four choke hold and how to do a flying wedge thing out of a front choke hold. it was interesting and fun, but it hurt like hell after a while. all kinds of whiplash and stuff. and there's really no way to warm up for that sort of thing. anyway, most of the way throught the class alicia and i were getting tired and hurt so we stopped trying as hard. as soon as our teacher saw that i didn't flip her he decided that i should flip someone in the middle of class. lucki.y that person was aaron. i really didn't want to flip him though, he smells too damn good and he's so cute. anyway, enough being girly..."

First OTP, people. No, really, even though Raiders was one year after The Empire Strikes Back. And later I think I obsessed a wee bit more about Indy/Marion than I did about Han/Leia, because of course it's the unresolved/failed/broken 'ships that are more fascinating than the resolved ones and Timothy Zahn wrote lots of good words covering Han and Leia's marriage.

But Indy/Marion? Poor neglected OTP. During the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, I kept my fingers crossed for an ep where a brash, fresh-from-college Indy meets the Ravenswoods for the first time. *sigh*

"event","Hi! How is everyone? :D I'm reading the flist but not posting to this account lately.

Hiatus on this LJ temporarily suspended due to additional crack about the planned <i>Dark Is Rising</i> movie.

Got the head's up from <lj user=""darkling1""> on this link to some <a href=""http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=41521"">official verification</a> of the alterations being made to Susan Cooper's <I>Dark is Rising</i> for the movie.

A lot of it is just confirmation of the bits of info that I ranted about back in <a href=""http://dotsomething.livejournal.com/149133.html"">January</a>, plus some new levels of wtf.

I have a few additional thoughts I'd like to share at this time. And I'd like to say, if the movie turns out to be a breathtaking work of staggering cinematic beauty of great epic and emotional scope, I will admit I'm wrong!

For now, it's my right to mock. Mockety mock mock.

<lj-cut text=""Sure enough...beyond imagining."">

<i>The character of the Walker (Jonathan Jackson) has been made younger-appearing and given a new story arc involving the loss of his soul.</i>

That's not so bad. The poor Walker suffers enough in the book, though, without losing his soul into the bargain. Perhaps Will should spend the movie looking for an Orb of Thessela? 

<i>The movie also beefs up the action by adding new special-effects-enhanced sequences to Cooper's narrative, Hodge said.</i>

The fact that they're planning big FX sequences? Cool! No, seriously. The part that makes me want to chew rocks is the implication that said sequences aren't present in the text to be adapted to the screen using CGI.

OH MY GOD DID THEY EVEN READ THE BOOK?

<i>Beyond that, the spine and spirit of the story remain</i>

You folks at Walden media just keeping telling yourselves that and you may believe it someday. Keep the faith!

Then they do explain exactly why they decided to change Will Stanton from being British to being American:

<i>Why make Stanton American? Because it's fitting that he is more of an outsider than in the book, Hodge said. Stanton should be culturally alien to the story's setting, which compels him to question why he is there and doing what he must do, he added.</i>

Oh, that's brilliant! Because y'know, Will Stanton's cultural identity as the descendent of generations of Buckinghamshire farmers isn't AT ALL important to the character. And Susan Cooper didn't at all make any sort of connection between character and SETTING on purpose, did she? 

Whew, is it me or did it just get very sarcastic in here?

Wait, there's more! It gets better!

<i>The film also adds several action sequences, including a chase in a modern mall and a fight among snakes in a medieval church, leading to the discovery of a secret crypt.</i>

Yes, that's right, a chase through a MALL. And snakes!

Peter Jackson might as well have decided Frodo was a midget from Des Moines who falls through a magical portal and ends up in middle earth because GOSH, that would make his journey SO MUCH EASIER to relate to!

Snakes! And a MALL! Actually, it's kind of funny. Kind of.

</lj-cut>

Thus endeth the rant."

"event","Hi. I swear I meant to do a real update and don't mean for my first post in a while to be only film-related.

But I'm having an unpretty film moment.

Unlocked, please link away.

Thank you <lj user=""sistermagpie""> for alerting me with her <a href=""http://sistermagpie.livejournal.com/139357.html"">post</a> with the info. Originally found by <lj user=""charlotteschaos""> and posted <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/thedarkisrising/65357.html"">here</a>. Here's the page ywith the <a href=""http://www.myentertainmentworld.com/mew/audition_film-tv.html"">original information</a>, the audition casting notes for Walden Media's adaptation of The Dark Is Rising.

<lj-cut text=""tomorrow will be beyond imagining"">

Before we go further.

1. Can anyone evaluate for me the reliability of the original site, myentertainmentworld.com? Are they reliable? Could the character notes be false or an early draft?

2. Films get revised so much in development so none of this may end up being the characters we'll get. However, given this is what they're starting with, it's easy to imagine how butchered the movie will be by the time it's gone through draft fifteen.

3. It could end up a wonderful film on its own terms, separate from the books. Just, for the record. However I won't be able to watch it. 

4. I'm aware of examples where books were altered significantly for the films and it worked out beautifully. I try not to be a rabid purist. Atmosphere matters as much as plot points.

This? Is not one of those times.  I'm being a purist. There are changes that are necessary for the transition from one format to another and then there are changes that alter the core of the characters until there's no point to a film adaption, you might as well only read the books, and save your $10.

Disclaimers out of the way, here's the audition character notes, which will only make your hair stand on end if you've, y'know, read the books:

<i>(Romania) - Send photograph & resumes ASAP to: Details Are only Available By Subscription.. Title: THE DARK IS RISING, Feature Film. EXEC PROD, Ron Schmidt; PROD, Marc Platt; DIR, David L. Cunningham; SCR, John Hodge. Shoot Dates: February, 2007 (in Romania). STORY: The film is about Will Stanton, who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is the last of the ""Old Ones,"" a group of immortal warriors who have dedicated their lives to fighting the forces of the Dark and he must undertake a difficult journey to defeat the evil powers that threaten the land. Breakdown-- Will Stanton: 13. Will is an American who lives in England with his family. Will is bullied and/or ignored by his older brothers, and Will is gloomily convinced that he's doomed to be a bookish, gawky oddball at the bottom of the pecking order. However, he is actually an innately cool kid who has not yet grown into his coolness; Professor John Stanton: 45-55. Will's father. Professor Stanton is an American physicist and college professor and he's paid a price for it. He is emotionally cool, authoritative and very remote from his children; The Rider: 30-40 years old man with icy malevolence who is masquerading as a simple village doctor when in fact he is an agent of Evil; Mrs. Mary Stanton: 40-50. She is the American mother of the Stanton six children. She works hard at protecting her husband and her family. She similar to her husband is not emotionally available to her kids and is very distant; Gwen Stanton: Will's younger sister, Gwen is an American, neat, upright girl of about 8 or 9. Unlike her brothers, who treat Will with amiable contempt, Gwen looks up to Will, loves him and dotes on him; Max Stanton: 19 or 20, an edgy young man with piercings and tattoos. Will's older brother. Max is the American, bohemian of the family. He is always inclined to question his father's authority; James Stanton: 17. Will's older American brother. James is mature, muscular and good looking, the object of admiring eyes. Busily looking for a girlfriend, James barely interacts with Will - especially when Maggie Barnes becomes the object of his affection; Robin Stanton & Paul Stanton: 15, Male. A pair of grungy American adolescents, Robin and Paul are identical or fraternal twin brothers, and they're still at the ""horseplay"" stage of development. Always ready to tease Will about his bookish ways, always willing to reinforce his fears of being a gawky oddball, Robin and Paul tease and bully and sometimes blow off Will. (Posted: November 2, 2006)</i>

It's still set in England (as in the book) but the family is American (in the book, region is a crucial part of the characterization). Will in the film will be 13 (in the book he's 11 and a lot seems to hinge on that particular age as a transitional year). Will's father is now a Professor (in the book he's a...farmer? Sorry, I need a re-read). Will is bullied by his older siblings, a geek (in the book Will's siblings are protective of each other and Will is not the least bit geeky). The Stanton parents are neglectful and distant (in the book they're warm and loving). Don't even get me started on what they've done to Will's siblings. Mary Stanton is the name of his sister in the book, but now that's the name of his mother, a very minor nit in relation to the rest but it's not helping, particularly since sister Mary plays a key role. Will's connection to his family is so crucial to his characterization, there's a lot of love in that family, so much that it both gives him strength to do what he does and is also his greatest vulnerability. That they decided to make him a bullied geek, overlooked and shunted aside, is a scary distortion of Cooper's point about large families with lots of siblings; Will is overlooked, but as ""ordinary,"" not as a victim. He's just a nice boy from Buckinghamshire with a very old soul.

That they would make the characters American, or set the film in America, was my single greatest fear about this movie. But you know, characterization that bears no resemblance to the characters in the actual book, that's a pretty big elephant sitting in the corner.

Please someone tell me the original website is a fake, that this is a joke, that the outcry will be so great Walden Media will be forced to switch things back to something that at least RESEMBLES Susan Cooper's vision of the character of Will Stanton, and of his family.

Walden Media has from the start presented this as an adaptation of the classic fantasy by Susan Cooper. This is the same company who made a reasonably faithful, true-to-the-book adaptation of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. Susan Cooper's series is not a lesser work, that it needs to be tinkered with to make it a stronger story.

As far as I'm concerned, there is no film.

Anyway, I've been reading a lot of words lately (pro and fanfic, just, words words and omg more words), and my comic book reading seems to be broken and my TV watching seems to be broken. Reading lines of prose text upset my ability to read the text/visual combination perhaps? It's not like I've suddenly lost faith in comics as a medium. Maybe I'm still too disenchanted with DC and it's still bleeding over into other works.

This isn't about books being better than other forms of media, just where my headspace is. Because about TV: I'm bored with most of it. But maybe I've been spoiled by the astounding shows I've gotten to watch over the years. So if it doesn't hit me just right, or if it doesn't hit that high note, I can't be bothered.

I've cut some from my watching list*, but not because the shows aren't GOOD. I've been thinking about this good vs. not-good thing about TV lately and at least with television, it's not a question of quality, it's a question of do these characters speak directly to you? This is probably true of all forms of entertainment, although a certain baseline of quality needs to be there.

Anyway, it's unnerving to be feeling...nothing...for stuff that others are so ecstatic about. Especially when in terms of mechanical elements, and genre, the show has everything I should like.

What shows I'm talking about is irrelevant**, I'm just...thinking aloud here. 

<font size=1>*When I say 'cut some,' I am still left with a silly long list of currently produced series I adore.
**I do tend towards shows that aren't big in the ratings. Not sure if that's coincidental.</font>

"event","Hi! So, I think a lot of you would really, really enjoy this movie.

<lj-cut text=""not-too-spoilerish natterings"">

The characterization was pretty strong. Not at the level of Monsters, Inc. and the like, but memorable. The story was amazing. You have what looks like this cute movie. Dancing penguins, and all that. But it's about so MUCH. It's epic (with a few visual moments that have to be deliberate LOTR movie shout-outs), hilariously funny, it carries a bunch of ""messages"" and yet never once was it heavy-handed or sentimental or preachy. There are even a few moments that will break you.

Aside from a great story and being entertaining, the visuals will knock you flat. Remember when the technical detail of Sully's hair was a great leap forward? This is like that, only more so. A good lot of it does seem like it was lifted from March of the Penguins, but that works in its favor. There are a few scenes that are hands-down some of the most haunting and beautiful images I've seen in an animated film in years.

<lj-cut>

Never thought I'd feel the need to refer to Joseph Campbell in reference to a movie about dancing penguins.

Hope everyone had a good weekend."

<lj-cut text=""cut for Pretty in Pink spoilers...as if there's anyone left who doesn't know how the movie ends."">

There's an alternate ending on the DVD--the one where Duckie gets the girl.

I had no clue, none, that this ending had ever been filmed. Apparently, it was changed after the test audience didn't like Andie ending up with Duckie. The only explanation I can offer is it was 1986, and Andrew McCarthy was very, very pretty.

This interview in <a href=""http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1328652_1_0_,00.html"">Entertainment Weekly</a> with Jon Cryer is so great--he's humble and funny and appreciative of the mark he's left as Duckie.

It gets better. The song Duckie and Andie were supposed to dance to is ""Heroes"" by David Bowie. *happy dance* It doesn't say if the original song is there with the original ending, but I'm assuming it will be.

I love ""If You Leave"" to bits. But ""Heroes"" is even better.

I rewatched the movie to refresh my memory and make it more interesting when I get to see the original ending. It seems so obvious now that it should be Duckie. They drop hints, the most blatant is Iona's comment to Andie that Duckie has ""strong lips."" There's more chemistry in the scene where Duckie and Andie are sprawled on her bed studying history than all the smooching between Andie and Blane. It's not that there's no chemistry between Andie and Blane; I think Andie was attracted to him. But he wasn't enough for her.

Andie helps Blane turn into the person he wants to be. She frees him from Steff's control. The Blane/Steff (yes, that slash is on purpose) is fascinating to watch--there's clearly a history there. At the very least, they've been joined at the hip since kindergarten and Steff has always been the leader and dictated Blane's social choices.

Blane is to Andie as Amanda Jones is to Keith in Some Kind of Wonderful, except Andie's motivations in dating Blane are purer than Keith's in dating Amanda. Andie and Blane each give each other something they need, but they aren't quite right for each other--there's a lot of distance between them that has nothing to do with economics and class politics.

Because of Andie, Blane will find himself an actual, good relationship someday. Because of Blane, Andie finds out she is desirable and that not all ""richies"" are jerks.

I think this may be one of the more complicated John Hughes movies, really, except the bitchy popular girls are mere caricatures, and Blane is a sadly underdeveloped character. Iona, Steff, Duckie, Andie, and her father are more solid.
</lj-cut>

So tell me, what's your favorite scene in a John Hughes' movie, and why? Quote dialogue if you'd like."

The series focuses on teenager Mark Grayson (yes, that last name, I know, I know) whose father is the world's most famous superhero. In addition to all the challenges of just being a teenager, Mark adjusts to finding out he shares his father's powers, and is learning to be a hero himself. There's a wide cast of characters, some stranger or funnier than others, but all of them very real. While the book is mostly about Mark, his parents are actual people too, with vulnerabilities, fears, strengths and weaknesses that have nothing to do with being super (Dad's superpowered; Mom is not.) The artwork is superb (first Cory Walker, then Ryan Ottley), clean lines, strong but with a fine touch. The facial expressions are so nicely done.

The way Kirkman handles the balancing of ordinary life with having a super-powered Dad is funny and poignant. The book is funny, except when it's ripping your heart from your chest in sympathy for the characters.

</lj-cut>
Be careful of spoilers if you decide to go read previews or reviews. It's doesn't look the part, at first, but it's a twisty plot. I suggest you just start reading Volume 1.

In other news, swamped with work, writing of all kinds, and no, I have not yet seen POTC yet but that will be remedied soon.

Also, Dreamland and Dreamland II have to be among my LEAST favorite X-Files episodes ever. After suddenly remembering how much I adored Triangle, I was then reminded of how bone-crushingly dull Dreamland was.

"event","Knew I'd left my movie squee around here somewhere.

So, here's the thing. Never been much on the big blue guy. I'm more of a batfamily fangirl, that's no shock. 

Still, I've always <EM>liked</EM> Superman. Whether in the comics or the movies or on Justice League, he always seems to bring a sense of comfort. I grew up on the Christopher Reeve movies, and really love the first one with all its dorkiness. Therefore, the stage was set for me to like Superman Returns. And my expectations were <EM>down here</EM> because the movies just haven't been doin' it for me lately.

<lj-cut text=""Somewhere during all this, I got owned. (SPOILERS)"">
It felt like 20 minutes to half an hour in and I wasn't having that much fun yet, except for Eva Marie Saint getting some good lines as Ma Kent. Not that it was a bad movie, but I was starting to squirm in my seat a little and wonder if this movie wasn't going to do anything for me but eat 2 1/2 hours of my life and fifty cents (I had a free movie voucher that fell out of my Justice League season two DVD's--see? DC fangirl :) but it was for $10.50 and the theater was $11). 

We get up to just before the first big set piece, where he saves the shuttle and the plane and my god, my cynical movie brain thought, yeah, blah blah blah, so he saves the day, Big CGI Stunt Piece #1, coming up. Because of the kind of movie this was, and because of how movies have been lately.

Which is really funny, remembering&nbsp;that, because turns out the Big Stunt Piece #1 left me breathless. Okay, that was fun, I thought, real adrenaline ride. What else have you got, movie?

After that things start moving along at a good clip, and I'm enjoying the funny little bits of Clark and him dealing with being back and oh, noes, Lois has a boyfriend and a kid, and all that. Oh, and there's Kevin Spacey being evil.

The boyfriend, Richard, though sadly underdeveloped, is likeable. He's a person, he's even a hero in his own way. Which I just loved, because it gave the Lois/Clark thing so much more meaning. The child was very well cast and natural and that's a good thing because given the story, if they had mis-cast the child, the whole thing would have folded like a house of cards.

Somewhere during all this, I got owned. The stand-out bits were

<ul>
<li> Brendan Routh's delivery on the whole ""I hope this doesn't put you all off flying. Statistics show..."" thing. Superman is a Big Blue Dork, and always will be, and I like it that way :). </li>
<li> Something about Lois standing barefoot on Superman's boots, and the line ""I had forgotten how warm you are."" That whole flying sequence was beautifully shot. </li>
<li> Lex Luthor ""Go on, say it."" ""You're insane."" ""No, not that! The other thing! Say it!"" ""Superman will never..."" ""AH HA!"" (or words to that effect). Spacey and Bosworth played against each other so well there. </li>
<li> The minute the kid puffed on his inhaler, I KNEW. Yeah, I know, I should have known before I even walked into the theater, sometimes I'm not too quick on the uptake about that kind of stuff. The whole thing is telegraphed but it didn't bother me, because I really liked that the kid was sick and weak because biologically, he would be, it made sense. And thematically, it made sense. </li>
<li> ""How did you get here?"" ""I flew."" Because, see above, Richard's a <i>person</i> and Lois does love him and he can fly too and I love complex triangles like that and HATE HATE HATE when one of the three turns out to be eeeeevil. Or dies (as I was worried they'd do to Richard)</li>
<li> Oh god, okay, kryptonite, Lex Luthor, the goons, kicking and punching and Superman face down in an icy puddle. That's where I came undone and couldn't see the screen because omg <i>crying.</i> Because we really love our heroes because of their vulnerabilities, not their strengths. </li>
<li> Lois, tugging on Superman's cape. Because the only time you do that is to save his life. Also, Lois saving him. Yes. </li>
<li> I'm helpless, I am. Lost it again in the hospital room when the little boy went over to the chair, and there's the cape, draped so forlornly. </li>
<li> (Note: I got very nervous they'd gone off the tracks with the hospital scene, when Lois kisses him and says things we can't hear, although my brain decided she said ""The world needs Superman, and so do I"" and was relieved when the heartrate reading didn't change. Because, ick. That could have wrecked the whole movie. The little boy kissing him on the forehead did actually work for me, it was genuinely cute and I think the writers want us to think <i>that</i> woke him up and not Lois. I think.) </li>
<li>I have three words for you: ""Great Caesar's ghost!"" Go Perry.</li>
</ul> 

I'm not even bothered by the Christ allegory, because I enjoyed the voice overs, and the emotion of it. 

</lj-cut>

It was just very entertaining, sweet without being false or sentimental, Brendan Routh did a good job, Kevin Spacey was brilliant but didn't upstage everyone in sight. It was also a very pretty film. The special effects set pieces were imaginative and there were some images that I feel should become iconic, or come from a very iconic idea of Superman. The movie has heart, soul, and maybe a tiny little bit of brain, though not as much as it should have. But for once I didn't care. It's a joyful yet sad film."

"event","<P>Hi. The shrink-wrap is&nbsp;off season six of The X-Files. I'm far more entertained than I expected to be. Even though it's true what they say, the mythology makes less and less sense...

<lj-cut text=""But I had completely forgotten just how gleefully, utterly, squee-filled the episode &quot;Triangle&quot; was."">

Because CSM as a Nazi! 

With William B. Davis saying his lines in German with the same sorts of pauses and inflections that CSM always uses. *snorfle*

Skinner, the double agent *flail*

The expression on Mulder's face every time he recognizes someone from the modern-day.

Scully in 1930's garb *more flailing* 

Moose and Squirrel doing 1930's style <EM>banter</EM>, racing down the corridors of the ship, like this was some kind of screwball 1930's mystery.

""In case we never meet again...""

I'm not sure which smooch made me happier, Scully and Skinner in the elevator, or Mulder &amp;&nbsp;1930s!Scully. No, really. After all these years, I think I may be a Scully/Skinner shipper, for all that I adore Moose &amp; Squirrel and their kiss here.

The camera action in this ep is <EM>fabulous</EM>. Scully and the rapid walk-and-talk shots and&nbsp;the way they used the elevators.

<lj-cut text=""Now actual thoughts on the episode (spoilers)"">

Hee. The new guy spent half the episode comatose, which is bloody <EM>brilliant</EM> because it gives the audience a chance to get used to looking at&nbsp;him and also gives us a chance to criticize him in an obvious way&nbsp;that builds low expectations.&nbsp;If New Guy spends the alien crisis lying there like a sack of potatoes,&nbsp;there's no way to go but up. Therefore making the actor switch more bearable.

It's not David Tennant's fault he's not Christopher Eccleston. It's not. Really. Tennant's going to do a fantastic job. He's adorable and manic and a good actor. But my inner fangirl is pouting. It's very much like when you're craving chocolate ice cream, and been thinking about chocolate ice cream all day, and chocolate ice cream is your one true <STRIKE>doctor</STRIKE> flavor but when you get to the ice cream place, they're out of chocolate ice cream. Strawberry ice cream is delicious, and so is vanilla chocolate swirl, and dulce de leche, but it's <EM>not chocolate ice cream.</EM> It's exactly like that. 

Seriously, though, their acting styles are different. Tennant seems to be picking up on Eccleston's mannerisms but that will probably blend away in time as he makes the role his own. I'm looking forward to watching it. It's all good, chocolate ice cream or not. :) Also, I thought Billie Piper was exceptionally good in this episode.

Oh, the previews for series 2, huzzah! Anyone know the UK start date? April something?

<lj-cut text=""So. Reactions."">

It might have been when the Doctor was wrestling with the mannequin arm. Cheese-ridden the show may be. But by golly, the two leads are really putting their hearts into it, and Chris Eccleston is just <EM>flinging</EM> himself into the role, literally and figuratively. 

It also might have been when Rose and the Doctor started talking in rapid-fire overlapping Hawkesian dialogue (I waited for the rest of the two eps for them to do that again, but they haven't yet. Aw, nuts. I hope they will that again later because it's <EM>adorable.</EM>)

Whatever it was, it took like twenty minutes in before&nbsp;I understood why people have been telling me and telling me and <EM>telling me</EM> to watch this show.

The show is fairly well-written. The special effects range from godawful cheap to oooh, pretty. The show always seems to be very good at walking the tightrope of being wacked-out funny, and then turning on a dime to an unexpected moment of pathos. And then we're right back to fantastic and cheese and funny again.

Rose &amp; The Doctor--um. Yeah.&nbsp;There's enough sexual subtext that the possibility of their romance is out there, but I'll be equally <EM>fascinated </EM>if it's just their developing partnership and friendship. Because right now there's only the wee&nbsp;start of a partnership and a friendship, and seeing this&nbsp;from the perspective of&nbsp;the beginning, Rose has a crush on him (even though he is <EM>such </EM>an infuriating man) and I think he kind of thinks she's pretty and sweet but, y'know, very young and doesn't think of her like <EM>that</EM> and doesn't think that much about her. Except when he remembers that he likes her and having her around and would be sad if anything bad happened to her.

I loved how Rose only smiled big, happy, yeah-I'm-alive smiles when she was&nbsp;running with the Doctor. It's like she's been asleep her whole life and for the first time realizing she's been asleep. He's the last of his kind, and she's bored. So he's lonely and needs her to keep him from being lonely, and she needs a rush. We're not at friendship yet, but the way shows like this work, it's going to be fantastic watching them start to care about each other as people. She's clearly in the sidekick role here--her function is to be in danger so the Doctor can save her, and remind the audience that he does have emotional bonds, he just puts them away in a dark pocket most of&nbsp;the time. The lightness of their relationship now is making me look forward to seeing their friendship really tested later on.

In ep 2, the bit where he tells the tree lady that he's got nothing left so it's a relief to him when there's a crisis and he has something to think about and do (I'm paraphrasing), that was lovely. Eccleston is fabulous in this. He's manic and remote and&nbsp;funny and enigmatic&nbsp;all at the same time.

Piper's performance--well, so far she's merely funny and cute, but since the show is funny, she's doing a great job. Oddly, she's the straight-man of the comedy team, even though she's the funny one, there to make quips and be spunky. While the Doctor is a tragic figure even though he's the source of a lot of the funny.

"event","Calling animation fans: go help out <lj user=""evillittletwit"">&nbsp;with a history project and tell her <A href=""http://evillittletwit.livejournal.com/180546.html"" target=_blank>what's your favorite Disney traditionally animated film, and why</A>.

Here's my answer (which is in the comments on <lj user=""evillittletwit"">'s journal and I thought worth reposting here).

<lj-cut text=""Gender, class, and Lady and the Tramp"">

I'll elaborate on why <I>Lady and the Tramp</I> is my choice, and why it's my favorite among my list of favorites. It's because in this movie everything that's great and good about Disney traditional line-drawn animated films came together into one beautiful package. Characterization, story, drama, songs, humor, romance, backgrounds, character animation, voice casting and <I>atmosphere</I>--was all just about perfect in this. There's only one real flaw, and that's because the Siamese cat song smacks a little too much of racial stereotyping. The Italians and the Scots get parodied too but in a much friendlier way (the Italians who serve Lady and Tramp the famous spaghetti dinner, and the Scottie dog, are both ""good guys"" while the Siamese cats are antagonists).

I think Lady and the Tramp is also the most interesting and complex of all the Disney films about male/female romance and relationships. Beauty and the Beast was probably second best on that list for me, and both B&amp;TB and L&amp;T deal with the theme of taming the male beast, but L&amp;T did it more subtly. Lady's not looking for adventure. She doesn't view Tramp as her ticket to a fuller life in the wide world, even though that's what he offers her. Even though Tramp does have to protect her (saves her from a pack of street dogs, helps her get the muzzle off) ultimately she doesn't need saving or rescuing from her old life--in fact, it's Tramp who needs saving, and it's Lady who draws Tramp into *her* world. At the end of B&amp;TB (and the other films involving princes or princesses), Belle is drawn into Beast's world. Cinderella goes to the castle to live happily ever after. Lady ends up where she started physically but emotionally she develops the confidence to understand what she wants her place in the world to be and who she wants to spend her life with and how she wants to live. She's a child--literally, a puppy--when we first meet her, and by the end of the movie she's fully grown and in charge of her dog family life and secure, finally, of her place with her human family.

I think it's interesting too how the movie uses the gender roles. Lady doesn't start out a fighter. She's terrified by the wide world and needs Tramp's protection physically (ironically, he's not really ""safe"" for her heart) but near the end a member of her human family is threatened and it turns out she can fight physically. Before that, she's established as outspoken. On the surface she's a frail female. When Tramp hurts her feelings she cries--and it's her tears that frighten and puzzle him the most. But she's not using the tears to manipulate. She's crying because she's sad and angry, and she doesn't hesitate to tell Tramp exactly how furious she is. Gender games are alien to her.

I'm not sure what to make of the show-dog female, one of Tramp's many exes (the Peggy Lee role). She's an interesting foil for Lady, but this might be one area where the film is dated as a product of its time and of stories like this. Tramp chooses the ""nice"" girl, putting the hussies like the show-dog in his past. That was fairly common to Hollywood in that time period--putting the hero between a whore and an angel.

The action sequences are some of the most well-staged and execution of anything in Disney history and the backgrounds are rich and lovely. It's an idealized vision of an Edwardian town, but it shows the squalor as well as the beautiful large homes. The movie's about class relations as much as a love story. There's a scene where the Scottie calls Tramp ""a mongrel"" and one of the many subplots is about the dogs in Lady's wealthy neighborhood recognizing that actions define you, not where you're from or how scruffy you look. But unlike some of the more message-y Disney films, it's not telegraphed or overt. It's just a story about character.

"event","<P>The non-spoilery comments: overall, a joy to watch. They tweaked and fine tuned, cutting some things from the book, adding things that weren't there. All of it was in service to the story and greatly enhanced the character story arcs. I couldn't find any scene that struck a false note or was maudlin or sentimental, which was a big danger in adapting a story like this to a movie children could safely go see. The director has a sense of humor and a sense of drama and menace. Also, wow, a&nbsp;<EM>script. </EM>And character arcs.

As for the Great Debate (fantasy? or Christian Allegory?) it was really irrelevant. The Christian allegory is of course present but is kind of absorbed into the greater overall adventure story, and the emtional themes are universal. There was only one moment in the whole movie where theologically, I twitched, not in revulsion but just because it jarred with my own personal worldview. It's actually something that's a problem with a lot of sword and sorcery kind of fantasy, not necessary the Christian viewpoint.

<lj-cut text=""Behind the cut, some thoughts on that, and more detailed analysis."">

When Aslan explains to Peter the nature of the deep magic, he says it defines good and evil and directs destinies (I'm paraphrasing). I don't recall if this is in the book or not, put just that way. Internally, that is, within this fictional universe, I have no problem with that. It's how the magic works in Narnia. But&nbsp;what happened to free will? Even within Christianity, there's the concept of free will so it's maybe not even so much a problem with the Christian allegory but with C.S. Lewis' philosphy. I'm going to leave it there because to follow that thread I'd need to have read his Christian writings, and have a better understanding of theology.

For fantasy in general, I'm not fond of prophecies and I like it when characters determine their own destinies rather than having them thrust upon them. This is, oddly, why the idea of the hero who grows into his role, or the reluctant hero, fascinates me. Prophecies or not, I think most fantasy heroes act out of choice, because they realize that if they don't do this, more people will suffer.&nbsp;

The film&nbsp;cranked up the ""reluctant"" part quite a lot, with the kids insisting they weren't heroes and at one point Susan, I think, tells Peter ""Just because&nbsp;a man in a red coat hands you a sword that doesn't make you a hero."" Which gave me an unfortunate Monty Python flasbback, but you know, the theme is the same. It's not the sword some watery tart or man in a red coat gives you that makes you King, it's your actions.

The film starts with Edmund breaking the rules and not listening to Peter, running back into the house to get the picture of their absent father. The addition of the London bombing scenes at the beginning was the largest change from the book and it worked so very well to lay the groundwork for the character arcs. Throughout the film, they keep coming back to Peter telling Edmund what to do and Edmund being the rebel and never obeying. Sure, Edmund's&nbsp;got problems, but I also thought&nbsp;Peter was overwhelmed, and therefore made a bad situation worse. Peter's&nbsp;struggling to be the protector and hold it all together but it keeps slipping from his control and&nbsp;his shoulders aren't quite broad enough yet to support it. And he knows it. So&nbsp;Peter snaps at Edmund a lot and makes mistakes that help drive Edmund farther away. I felt&nbsp;so sad for him.

Also having Edmund so determined to go back to the house for Dad's photograph was a nice character point that helped&nbsp;explain why Edmund is so confused and headed down the wrong path. The kid's just traumatized--it's easy to&nbsp;imagine how the father/son dynamic might have been for them and either way, his father's absence is&nbsp;tough on him. (My guess is that either Edmund's the favorite and they're close--the father being much tougher on Peter, the eldest--and Edmund worships him. Or that Peter's the father's favorite and Dad's much harder on Edmund and Edmund still worships him).

Interesting touch, that in a fantasy world where destinies are already determined by deep magic (supposedly), Edmund saves the day by disobeying yet again. (Also, the centaur gets turned to stone because he didn't listen to Peter shouting ""Stop!"") I'm not sure I ever quite got that dynamic from just the book and it's an interesting addition (like Boromir being tempted by the ring in the movies but not the books, it's an alteration that makes perfect sense).

Peter was book Peter in a lot of ways--he's always been bossy and overcompensates trying to protect his younger siblings and I've always picked up on that in the book, but it was nicely highlighted in the movie and turned into an actual thing. I'm not sure it's quite as much of a thing in the book.&nbsp;One of my favorite added&nbsp;moments was when Peter looks up in the train station at the beginning and sees a young&nbsp;soldier.&nbsp;The actor shows you clearly that Peter's having a ""why him not me"" moment.&nbsp;Survivor's guilt? Wanting to identify with the absent father?&nbsp;The&nbsp;character is old enough to identify himself with the boys going&nbsp;to the front and it seems like he wishes he could do more. But instead he's going to sit in the quiet countryside and babysit, safely hidden away. Or so he believes. Once he gets to Narnia, though, he's actually reluctant to take up the role of warrior, which&nbsp;is an old theme: boy longs to do glorious important things, but longing for it and then being faced with actual combat are very different. So Peter finds out what war really is, makes his first kill (that scene was so well done)&nbsp;and finally figures out how to be leader/protector.

One other thing about the war.&nbsp;From the original book, but highlighted in a big way in the movie, is the theme of children's helplessness during war. The Pevensies get empowered by going to Narnia. They can't do anything about the war at home but&nbsp;Narnia is a place where children can help&nbsp;restore good to the world.&nbsp;It's less terrifying for them to be&nbsp;involved in the&nbsp;struggle in Narnia and be scared there, than it was for them to be huddled&nbsp;shaking in a bomb shelter.

Finished reading Phillip Pullmans trilogy and I have thoughts.

Again, I first looked back on what I'd said about the first two books in order to try and put my thoughts in order. For your reference:
<A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/dotsomething/93779.html"" target=_blank>Comments on The Golden Compass</A>
<A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/dotsomething/118258.html"" target=_blank>Comments on The Subtle Knife</A>

Spoilers. Beware.

<lj-cut text=""General thoughts, Mrs. Coulter and Asrial's relationship"">

My brain isn't as completely scrambled as it was by <EM>The Subtle Knife</EM> but I still loved this and feel like I could spend months just reading these books and discussing them and writing essays.

Mrs. Coulter and Asrial finally find their passion for each other, instead of just being about the Dust. Yet even there, it's not really love for each other that unites them but their love for their child, which is so true of some divorced couples in the real world. Mrs. Coulter even says she has no good in her and the Metatron sensed that, except for her love for Lyra, which she kept hidden from the Metatron. Yet in many ways Asrial and Marisa do sort of unite in the end.

Marisa and Asrial vs. the Metatron: daaaaaaamn. I stopped reading and kind of blinked at the book a few times. Pullman describes the feel of the battle so vividly, he actually sat down and imagined what it would be like to fight an angel. I'm floored.

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Lyra's arcs: sleep, lies, and the alethiometer"">

Lyra seems to be wide awake. She sleeps, but not like she does in the first book. In fact, towards the end she tells Will she wishes everyone else would fall asleep,&nbsp;that is, time would stop, so&nbsp;she and Will could be together in the <EM>Mulefa</EM> world forever.

The arc of Lyra and lying plays out to its conclusion. I found it interesting that the Harpy was enraged because Lyra's stories were <EM>lies</EM> and what was needed was stories about real life. It's interesting because I'm not sure what the author is getting at there, since the author is a storyteller who has made up lies to tell us this story. In a work like this, it's easy to read everything as the author's own personal philosophy. We know a lot of this is Pullman's philosphy, like <EM>Lord of the Rings</EM> reflected Tolkien's and The Chronicles of Narnia reflected Lewis'. But does Pullman believe that stories=lying? Yet at a certain point the phrase ""tell them a story"" starts cropping up, but each time it's meant to tell a true story, not a tale or myth. 

<EM>""I haven't always told the truth, and I could only survive in some places by telling lies and making up stories."" </EM>--Lyra (chapter 38)

That so reminded me of Veronica Mars, who once told her father that the spying and prying of detective work, the lies, were what they had to do to survive. Lyra's a survivor of that type, lying not because of lack of morals but because she's scared and it's a way to protect herself and those she loves. But by the end of <EM>The Amber Spyglass</EM> Lyra's given up on lying; she doesn't have to anymore. I kept wondering during the world of the dead sections and the stuff about true stories, if Lyra would come eventually to realize she was a fiction writer rather than a historian, but by the end she seems to be in the historian role. I'm not sure what Pullman is trying to get across about the role of history vs. the role of fantasy.

In addition to all the other arcs, there's an ""Alethiometer arc"". In <EM>The Subtle Knife</EM> Lyra refocuses and stops using it for her own ends. At the end of <EM>Spyglass</EM>, she loses the ability to read it because, she's told, knowledge gained by years of study is better than knowledge gained by grace.

On the whole, Lyra's character development is amazing and by the end you see she's believable grown and changed from the little girl at the start of the series. 

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Lyra and Will: taboos and subtext, what subtext?"">

Lyra and Will's journey towards adulthood continues. Just one way this happens, the continued shift from concern for their parents to concern for each other. Will can't use the thought of his mother to break the knife at the end, unlike at the beginning of <EM>The Amber Spyglass</EM>, it isn't enough to distract him. He has to think of his love for Lyra instead, and the knife shatters (love shatters knives...interesting image).

There's more subtext and not-so-much the subtext and Will and Lyra&nbsp;finally&nbsp;doing away with every daemon taboo there is, growing beautifully from that moment in <EM>Knife</EM> when Pantalaimon licks Will's hand. It's still <EM>OMG shock!</EM> to Will and Lyra when they touch each other's daemons, but then it's pleasurable. 

I can't even call what Pullman does in those passage subtext, unless it's subtext&nbsp;just beneath the surface in plain view but kind of murky and distorted. He&nbsp;keeps it from breaking the surface. I'm not even going to debate whether or not they had sex. It's not irrelevant but they're intimate with each other in ways the adults in this book just aren't, so it's kind of moot. 

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Endings"">

The ending of this? Just so worked. Pullman goes a bit overboard with Lyra's declaration of how she'll love Will forever and their atoms will be comingled (I kind of rolled my eyes at this point...okay, you're in love, here's a shiny ribbon, shut up already). But I still felt terrible for them and Pullman made the scramble to try to find a way out of it, a ""loophole,"" believable, while at the same time showing the inevitabilty of their parting. The most poignant moment for me, and the one that'll give me a lump in my throat if I just think about it randomly, was Will and Lyra arranging to sit under their worlds' mirror tree once a year, every year, at mid-day on Midsummer's Day. 

There's also the implication they won't meet again until both are old, which is kind of sad and sweet and I loved, loved, loved that Lyra thought to give Will the speech about if&nbsp;they each meet&nbsp;someone&nbsp;they like and get married they won't hold it against these people that they aren't Lyra or Will. Quite the realist is Lyra. Yes, the love of your life, the love that happens but once in an eternity, may be shut away in another world but life goes on. It sucks. It hurts. But it is and there's nothing they can do to prevent it.

I like happy endings in general, but not when they're falsely sentimental or violate character and that fictional universe's rules just to get to that happy ending.

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Pullman vs. C.S. Lewis"">

The main point Pullman seems to be trying to get across about religion and the church is, I think, Lyra's words&nbsp;on the last page of <EM>Spyglass.

""...the Kingdom was over, the Kingdom of Heaven, it was all finished. We shouldn't live as if it mattered more than this life in this world, because where we are is always the most important place.""

</EM>Beyond that, I'm not sure I fully understand. I'd have to reread the whole trilogy. All the things with Dust, and the particles Mary can see with her spyglass, and Dust is for children, and then adults get the other stuff, and how the Dust is leaking out of the worlds and taking intelligent thought with it...really interesting but could I explain really what the heck Pullman meant by it to someone else? Not so much. I like the idea of all the intelligent thought and feeling leaking out of the world, because right now that's what it feels like a lot of the time.

On an additional note, Phillip Pullman's been speaking out against The Chronicles of Narnia, that they represent all of the worst traits of Christianity. Which strikes me as odd, since one of the message of His Dark Materials is very similar to the lessons the children learn in Narnia, that the hard route is the right route, that people <EM>""have to be kind instead of cruel, and patient instead of hasty, and cheerful instead of surly, and above all how to keep their minds open and free and curious""</EM> (Xaphania the angel in Chapter 37). I think Xaphania and Aslan would probably have a lot to discuss. It seems like these are the values Aslan is trying to teach, with regards to the patience, kindness, and cheerfulness. Even open-mindedness is a theme in Narnia as well--the characters run into trouble when they form preset opinions without bothering to dig deeper, or when they're too wrapped up in their own ways and customs to understand anyone else.

"event","<lj-cut text=""U2 Vertigo tour, with something like coherence"">

This was not only my first U2 concert but my first large venue concert. I got quite the buzz as I walked towards the MSG front entrance and saw on the marquee ""Tonight U2 Vertigo SOLD OUT."" I don't know how many MSG seats, but it's a lot. And we were all singing along&nbsp;through most of&nbsp;it.

Keane opened for them. They're <EM>very good</EM>, if you've never heard of them, classify them in your mind in the column just below ""Coldplay."" They've had one album so far and there was just something so gutsy about a group like that opening for U2.&nbsp;Before they did their thus-far signature song ""Somewhere Only We Go"" the lead singer said ""I know we're not U2 but if you know the lyrics, feel free to sing along"" and some of the audience did. The rest of the audience drank beer, chatted, and wandered in and out which I don't blame them for, they hadn't heard of Keane yet. Their loss.

But enough about Keane! So there was a half hour break. We watched the sound check guys do sound check while the clock crept past nine and I finally let myself get jittery and excited. Because before that, my mindset was ""I will believe I am going to see U2 in concert when I am in my seat watching them.""&nbsp;

Finally the lights&nbsp;went down and a shadowy figure&nbsp;came out&nbsp;alone on the stage, and those guitar notes drifted up into the cavernous space and I had literal goosebumps. That was Edge, doing the opening for ""City of Blinding Lights."" Then everything sort of exploded with light, Bono and the rest appear, glittery confetti falls from above&nbsp;on the lyric ""A city lit by fireflies.""

I'm trying to remember all of what they played, and of course can't, but here are the high points in no particular order--they nailed ""City of Blinding Lights."" They played ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,""&nbsp;""Pride,"" ""One"" and ""With or Without You."" Before doing ""Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own"" Bono talked about his father, who loved opera and would stand in front of the radio pretending to conduct. They did ""I Will Follow"" and ""Miss Sarajevo"" and ""Bad,"" which awed J. because she said they almost never play that live. When the opening guitar lines of ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" started, J. and I started jumping up and down, clutching each other's hands and squealing for joy, which was just fine because all around us tens of thousands of other grown-ups were doing&nbsp;about the same thing. 

Bono crawled on the floor blindfolded, marched, leapt, and ran around the oval, clasped hands with the audience down in the pit. Larry Mullens actually emerged behind his drums to play a small drumset out at the front of the oval. Edge sang (though not alone). Bono played guitar. Adam Clayton&nbsp;supported it all&nbsp;with his bass guitar, the unsung hero.

I've seen DVD's of their concerts and talked to people who have been to see them live, so I had certain expectations but this went <EM>beyond </EM>anything I could have expected. They're brilliant musicians and showmen in the old-fashioned sense, and the four of them have such a rapport and their joy in the music is so clear and they project that to the audience&nbsp;as if they&nbsp;want you to feel that joy too. Bono hit that soaring sustained note in ""Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own"" <EM>just</EM> so, and held out his microphone to get the audience to sing the familiar songs.

At one point,&nbsp;Bono's throat&nbsp;scratched on the start of a line, so he had to run over and&nbsp;take a sip from his water bottle. The audience kept right on, finished singing the line for him,&nbsp;and then he picked&nbsp;right up and did the line how he'd wanted to and kept on going,&nbsp;with sort of a nod towards the crowds that telegraphed <EM>sorry about that, thanks, for being patient.</EM>&nbsp;

<lj-cut text=""What worked, what didn't, a little bit spoilery so beware"">

Overall, superb. Clever writing, interesting characters, striking visuals. Not your run-of-the-mill science fiction film, or your run of the mill film, period. I thought bits of it were rushed, and Kaylee and Inara were woefully underdeveloped. Everything else was fine. That's the objective moviephile talking. Nathan Fillion was just superb. He totally owned this movie, and his role as Mal, beyond anything he's done in the tv series so far. Maybe the large screen was necessary to see how he does interesting things with his chin and his eyebrows and his mouth. He's a fascinating actor to watch. Summer Glau once again proves she's probably the best actor in the cast. Beyond those two--who really are the focal point of the film--Adam Baldwin is the best out of the Serenity crew performance wise. 

Talking as someone who has seen, and liked, <EM>Firefly</EM>, I'm still traumatized. Preknowledge of the characters turns this from a decent movie into a blow-your-mind movie.

Still. Traumatized. OMG.

"event","<P>I've finished reading volume II of His Dark Materials, and my mind is generally blown.

<lj-cut text=""thoughts on The Subtle Knife. Contains spoilers."">

Somewhere around 10-15 pages from the end of this book I&nbsp;cursed out Phillip Pullman, in the sense that he is a brilliant genius who is heartlessly cruel to his characters in the best possible way.

I love the writing, and would get distracted sometimes because I'd have to stop and re-read this or that paragraph or sentence, like the words were candy to be rolled around in my brain. There's something cruel about his prose as well as his plotting. His prose is heartaching yet sharp as the knife Will has to carry. This is a harsh fictional world, the kind of place where suffering is necessary for a greater good and characters aren't really allowed to be content. They're allowed to be <EM>happy</EM>, in a sort of dizzying heights sort of way. But ordinary contentment doesn't happen. Sometimes there's hints of it. Will and Lyra cooking omelettes maybe, but that's near the&nbsp;beginning and it's all downhill from there. 

Lyra hasn't yet gotten what she needs and wants from her parents. Will gets what he needs from his father ultimately but not in the way he needed it. That scene near the end just ripped my heart out, and the abruptness of how that ends is just a kick in the stomach. Yet it didn't leave me feeling empty or like Will didn't get what he was looking for. Pullman writes Will's fight with his father in a way that it seems like his father is finally holding Will, and after the fight he gives Will the approval Will was craving. If you've read these already, then you'll know why right after that scene I was literally shaking the book going&nbsp;<EM>OMGWTF!</EM> (and if you haven't read these books yet, why are you reading these comments anyway? Seriously, you do not want these books spoiled for you. Shoo!)

It was interesting how right after that, Lyra's missing and Will seems totally floored and devastated by it. Almost like getting the encounter with his father has allowed him to shift focus, now his concern is for Lyra (that's a little bit Freudian there, I know). Which actually brings Will back to the role of protector he had with his mother, in a way.

The ""Paradise Lost"" parallels are coming through more clearly now. Also much as I liked Lee Scorsby in the first book I felt like his character didn't come through as strongly as it did in this one. Just when I was really starting to like him, again <EM>OMGWTF!</EM> The effect will bleed backwards and when I reread book one again, I think I'll be more attuned to his character. This really feels like one long single novel rather than 3. In fact I wonder if it really is, and the publisher just made him cut it into 3 at certain points, anyone know? None of those cuts are really good places to end a novel, they're just raw ends like Will's lost fingers and we either need balm or the next volume.

Just reread over my own comments on <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/dotsomething/93779.html"" target=_blank>The Golden Compass</A>. Following up on the theme of Lyra being half asleep, in this one Lyra seems to be awake and aware. It's Will who is frequently having nightmares or is half-asleep. Ironically towards the end he can't sleep or be still, even though he's beyond exhaustion. But my impression is&nbsp;this book has less of the sleepy to it. 

On the subject of Lyra's role as an actress and lying, I thought it was fascinating when she&nbsp;thinks how much harder it is to&nbsp;tell lies&nbsp;in Will's (i.e.&nbsp;pretty much the ""real"") world. More on the morality question was her promise to Will to stop using the Alethiometer just for her own curiosity and start using it to a purpose. In Book I Lyra got very used to just trying to survive with Pantalaimon. It's not that she had no help or guidance other than her demon or the Alethiometer, but she was mostly alone in her journey and had to consult the Alethiometer as a matter of staying alive. In Book II, now she has a sort of spear-bearer in Will and becomes aware that it isn't just herself (and her soul) vs. the world alone, there's Will as well, and she needs to use the tool in a more focused way and not overuse it.

One of the most amazing moments in the series so far,&nbsp;is when Will is crying and Pantalaimon turns into a dog and licks his hand to comfort him and Lyra is shocked and astounded, as is the reader, because Pullman succesfully set up that taboo. I loved&nbsp;that Lyra and Pantalaimon know how important this is but Will is oblivious. Will is oblivious about a lot of things. It's not that he's dumb, but he seems to be the hand and Lyra the brains.&nbsp;

I'd have to go back and check but it seems to me in Book I was there were people forcibly touching someone else's demon and it was horrifying, and there were demons touching other demons, and it was either sensual or just friendly, or their battling each other. Book II has more of the demons touching demons sexual subtext (always with Mrs. Coulter, isn't it? Sex is her weapon?). But now for the first time we have a demon touching another person for comfort and it's not horrifying, it's kindness, except it's horrifying just in the shock of violating the taboo.

</lj-cut>

I had other stuff to read but now I guess I'll plunge onward&nbsp;to <EM>The Amber Spyglass </EM>while I'm in that headspace. If you haven't read these books yet, I recommend them highly.</P>"

"event","You might want to stand back and don those squee goggles. Because this evening I&nbsp;attending a&nbsp;taping of The Daily Show, the episode that airs tonight at 11 pm on Comedy Central.

<lj-cut text=""Abandon News, All Ye Who Enter Here"">

...which if you remember from my earlier post, is what is on the sign over the door leading into the studio. The studio's a building all unto itself way the heck over on 11th avenue. You can't miss it since it has huge banners that say <EM>The Daily Show</EM> on it.

So we get into the VIP line and wait. Then they let us inside and there was more waiting. Then they let us into the studio itself, which was much smaller than I expected it to be based on how it looks on TV, and all the talk recently about the ""big new studio"" and all the extra seats they said they wound up having. But since I've never been to a taping in my life, this may just be a normal thing.

There were 3 or 4 cameras, including the crane camera that sweeps over the audience. There were a lot of lights. We were in the second row in one of the two VIP sections that flanks Mr. Stewart's desk, quite close, which was awesome. We waited some more, and then a guy came out and started to work the crowd. He's called a ""warm-up monkey"" and was pretty funny. He coached us on screaming loudly and laughing loudly enough, heckled the crowd a little.

Actually, I can see why a warm-up monkey is needed. Even though everyone was excited to be there and were psyched for it, if we hadn't had the coaching, we'd all have applauded too politely and too quietly, with just a few whoops. It's just human nature. Most of us aren't used to being in a tv studio.&nbsp;Someone had to tell the audience it's okay to yell your head off and go nuts. I mean, I think people generally would like to scream out their adoration, but usually you don't have a coach telling you no, you aren't expressing your love loudly <EM>enough</EM>. It was strangely cathartic.

So Jon Stewart comes out and everyone jumps to their feet and goes crazy, which was terrific. He talks to the audience a bit, makes with the funny. Then it's time to get serious and do the taping, so&nbsp;he gets in his chair at his desk. There's a telemprompter on the camera. The director counts down, then signals to the audience to start cheering. I could barely hear his opening words, the cheering was so loud. He was miked, and sounded oddly muffled throughout, because while the process of taping was very much like live theater, it's for TV. If he projected like they do for live theater, the sound would be too muddy and loud to use for the show.

We got to see Rob Cordry do a segment against a green screen. He's adorable and then some.

Stuff you only get to see at a taping: after Cordry finished his bit, Stewart did a little flail-flapping-papers&nbsp;""you rock!"" thing at him and Cordry grinned and exited.&nbsp;The cast must have&nbsp;such rapport after working together, they seemed to be fans of each other.

Other small things of note: they show the clips on TVs so the audience sees what he's commenting on. During a ""great moments in punditry"" segment, I snuck a glance over at Jon Stewart, who was standing in the corner, and he was watching&nbsp;the audience <EM>watch</EM> the segment with a tiny smile on his face like ""Yup, they'll love this, uh-<EM>huh.</EM>"" Also, he has great focus. While Cordry talked and the camera was off Stewart, he held his facial expression. Barely even blinked, so he'd be ready when they cut back to him.

Between tapings, some guys in shorts and sneakers with headsets would come up to the Desk and talk to him. He made notes. I tried to figure out what they were saying. Most likely they were just working out how they wanted to handle various cuts and shots, although I thought it was funny that for all we knew they were discussing how&nbsp;they all like their&nbsp;coffee, <EM>you need to use half and half next time, and maybe up the sugar content a little *nod nod*

</EM>There's apparently a studio dog, we saw him on the way out, very friendly with the crowd.

</lj-cut>

And that's how I spent my evening.

"event","So I finally got my&nbsp;revised, expanded&nbsp;edition of The Outsiders DVD. Since I've been babbling&nbsp;about this&nbsp;new edition a lot lately, I thought&nbsp;some follow-up comments were&nbsp;in order. Mostly, this is about the soundtrack.

<lj-cut text=""This will take some getting used to (no spoilers)"">

The additional 22 minutes of footage added are all wonderful, and necessary. This feels a bit like seeing the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the movie theater, and then watching the extended edition at home on DVD, ""oh, so <EM>that's</EM> the film you were trying to make.""* I have trouble imagining the LOTR movies without those scenes from the extended editions, even though the theatrical cuts would have seemed just dandy if I hadn't known there was going to be an EE. 

<FONT size=2>*as opposed to what George Lucas did to his Star Wars trilogy.</FONT>

Side note: watching C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio play Ponyboy and Johnny&nbsp;reminded me fleetingly of&nbsp;Elijah Wood and Sean Astin playing&nbsp;Frodo &amp; Sam. Something about the way the boys were curled up together sleeping, as fugitives. Just an odd brain spasm.&nbsp;If <EM>Gone With the Wind </EM>hadn't been the boys' major touchstone, then <EM>The Lord of the Rings</EM> might easily have been a good substitute.

[ETA 1: what also made me think of this was Johnny Cade saying that until he and Ponyboy had to be fugitives, he had never been away from his own neighborhood before, which reminds me of Sam saying ""If I take one more step I will be farther from home than I have ever been before."" I'm not sure who is Frodo and who is Sam and this is a tangent I should probably get off of now.]

What was a bit of a shock to me was how much changing the score changed the movie. I knew that Francis Ford Coppola had&nbsp;added some period songs. What I didn't know was that Carmine Coppola's original score was almost completely scrapped in the process.

The&nbsp;movie&nbsp;can&nbsp;be sentimental, and the period rock 'n roll songs that replaced&nbsp;the original score&nbsp;help undercut that. Coppola says it's because he thought there should be music the characters would listen to as a score. As a result, the Elvis Presley songs make the film seem harsher and more immediate. It's not as easy to get to the emotion, and by standing back a little, it's more effective.

But a part of me is mourning the original score. It has more to do with emotion than film quality.&nbsp;It's because&nbsp;I grew up on that score and spent the 80's watching The Outsiders on VHS. It's one of those old reliable movies. For a while I knew it well enough that I could tell you which passage of music went with which exact beat of action. So the removing of the old style Hollywood score left me disoriented. Carmine Coppola's main Outsiders theme in itself is enough to bring a lump to my throat. The new soundtrack doesn't have that effect on me. It's too late. It's also because I have a weakness for film scores. I enjoy soundtracks, but am much more impressed by a good score.

I have no doubt that this revised version of the film is the better film, in tone and depth. But it's debatable whether this film should have a romantic film score, or a rough and tumble, relevant rock and roll soundtrack. I could make arguments both ways.&nbsp; Right now I'm leaning more towards the soundtrack being better than the score only because I suspect I'm not judging the music fairly. I love the score just because it's familiar, not because it was necessarily the best choice.&nbsp;

It's just too bad that&nbsp;amputation had to be part of the process. As a general rule, it's not a good idea to take a classic film and completely change the music.

And not having the scenes that were restored to this version feels like just as much of a cruel amputation. I can't have it both ways (well, I can. The original theatrical DVD is cheap, and apparently out of print according to amazon so I ordered it from a used dealer, so I can have the version that's most familiar, and the version that's really the best one).

[ETA 2: funny note from the extras. A very young Adam Baldwin auditioned for this movie. Of course, every male actor in the US who was between the ages of 13 and 30 in 1982 auditioned for this movie. Still, they had brief footage of him and it was just...ha.]

"event","When I wrote <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/dotsomething/111412.html"" target=_blank>this post</A> on the greatest teen angst movies of all time, there were a few films I&nbsp;forgot to mention.

These aren't the brightest films in the crayon box, but each has a really interesting angle on teens. Plus, I really like them, and have not yet reached my limit for how many times I can sit through them.

<lj-cut text=""It's a do or die situation"">

The Goonies&nbsp;(1985) is not really teen angst. It's adventure. Except, no, wait. It has some of the formula. Outsiders vs. bullies, coming-of-age/self discovery, and the kid from the wrong side of the tracks gets the pretty, popular girl, while the arrogant social leader gets his comeuppance. And Mikey is angsty.&nbsp; Other than that, it doesn't really belong in the teen angst category, but it should certainly be included in lists of any significant films starring teens.

The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) in some ways is the all-time great teen angst movie. It's a bunch of teens vs. the <EM>entire world.</EM> Awesome. Helen Slater's like a female James Dean. It's a bit silly, yet each time I watch, I get a bit of a thrill from scenes like Billie Jean walking down the sidewalk, children trailing behind her as if she's the pied piper, on her way to rescue a child from his abusive father. In 1985, I wanted to be the girl running down the mall dramatically pulling that wig off her head. Because that was very cool when I was 13. Plus it's also a funny film and has the adorableYeardley Smith in it. Do you have any idea how many girls cut off their hair after seeing this film? Cutting of the hair is <EM>huge</EM> in girl coming-of-age stories (c.f. the book&nbsp;<EM>Anne of Green Gables</EM>). A new haircut changes everything. Also, this film is the source of the BEST teenage pop song <EM>ever. </EM>Formula elements: outsiders vs. the established, coming-of-age (in more ways than one). There's even an outsider romance with a rich kid, only the rich kid proceeds to upset&nbsp;several tropes. If he were in a John Hughes flick, he'd either be more good-looking and confident, or he'd be a complete jerk. This one is neither.

Additionally, Billie Jean herself always reminds me of Buffy. Maybe it's Helen Slater's performance reminding me of Sarah Michelle Gellar's. The same ""kill you dead where you stand"" glare, the pretty face and resolve of steel.

Cruel Intentions (1999) is a nasty little film, a bit cheap, but fun. Its formula doesn't come from teen angst movies but from <EM>Les Liaison Dangereuses. </EM>Betrayal, lies, quasi-incest, plotting, scheming, sexual discovery, and twooo wuv. I'm thinking about whether this follows the teen angst film formula, but all the characters are insiders not outsiders.&nbsp;<EM>Cruel Intentions</EM> also doesn't end like any teen angst genre film I've ever seen, though.

Can't Buy Me Love (1987)&nbsp;is the budget John Hughes. This hit the same year as Some Kind of Wonderful, and post-dates the rest of the John Hughes canon. They were clearly trying to get the John Hughes audience. Dippy premise with some nice moments. <strikeout>It's also the <EM>only</EM> teen film I can remember seeing that</strikeout> This and <i>Heathers</i> are the only two I can think of off-hand that openly acknowledges that all these outsiders, and all these popular jocks, when they were in middle school, elementary school, were <EM>friends.</EM>&nbsp;Best buds.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;puberty&nbsp;arrives and everyone&nbsp;switches friend groups.&nbsp;I witnessed and experienced it first-hand myself.&nbsp;Yet this is the only film in both my lists that addresses the phenomenon.

The film truly qualifies as teen-angst flick, and you know it does it very well when you have a teenaged boy curled up in his parents' garage sobbing alone in the dark. Even the great Hughes never did&nbsp;that.

If nothing else, <EM>Can't Buy Me Love</EM> also features a wee, snarky Seth Green.

Lucas (1986) isn't quite the wonderful movie I thought it was when I was 14 but I rewatched this last winter, and it still got to me. Oh, it's overly precious in some ways, but it has genuine emotion too. It's more realistic than other teen flicks. The jock is not a one-note jerk. It breaks other formulas in ways I won't say in case some of you haven't seen it, I don't want to spoil (although it's a safe assumption most people have seen all of these movies, or can at least guess the ending within fifteen minutes of the beginning). The main focus is a complex friendship, and the female lead has one foot in both worlds, being both newbie outsider, and a normal girl with all signs of being popular and socialized.

I'm sure I've forgotten something.

[ETA: I forgot <lj-cut text=""Marty McFly"">...

Back to the Future (1985) belongs in the ""superteen"" and ""adventure"" group with Ferris Bueller, Buffy, and The Goonies. <lj user=""ivy03""> pointed out that if you take out the time-travel stuff, this is ""straight up teen drama"" as a boy learns about who his parents were, and therefore, where he comes from. Marty is an outsider big time who gets a certain amount of self-discovery. The romance is all from Mom and Dad, formula is followed: geek gets pretty popular girl.

In a lot of these films, the protagonist has some kind of adult mentor. Buffy had her first watcher, Pretty in Pink had the Annie Potts character. Some of them have parents they can actually talk to (the Dad in ""Sixteen Candles""), some don't. Billie Jean has an odd shadow-mentor in the form of the sympathetic cop who is chasing her. Mikey Walsh had One-Eyed Willie. Others have no adult mentors whatsoever, only nemesis. The Breakfast Club has the biggest anti-mentor of all time in Principal Vernon (with the janitor being a shadow mentor for Brian; the parents in TBC are just useless.) Marty McFly had Doc Brown.
</lj-cut>]

[ETA II: and I forgot <lj-cut text=""Heathers"">...

Heathers (1989) really belongs in my first post, with the ""all time greatest"" list. It took the teen flick formula, took the safeties off, turned it upside down, and shook it vigorously. The finding of true love is no longer the ultimate goal. The nasty popular crowd gets it comeuppance in ways previously unheard of in the genre. Characters walk a morally ambiguous line. It really sort of strips the veneer off the ""bad boy"" archetype.
</lj-cut>

and <lj-cut text=""Mean Girls"">...

Mean Girls (2004) has at its core a nasty girl-group of popular teen princesses. The ""plastics"" instead of the ""Heathers."" It's one of the more realistic looks at girl dynamics in high school, based on the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400047927/qid=1126882457/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0835812-8307251?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"">Queen
Bees and Wannabes</a>. Aside from that it's nothing new. Nice outsider girl wins popular boy. Snotty popular girls get their comeuppance. I put it in the ""runner-up"" category. 

Also notable is the usage of outsider girl in disguise as a popular girl, which was in play in <i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i> and <i>Never Been Kissed</i>. <i>Can't Buy Me Love</i> did this with a guy instead of a girl.

</lj-cut>

and

<lj-cut text=""Never Been Kissed"">

Never Been Kissed (1999) is a silly movie. It does have Drew Barrymore, who isn't playing a teen, but a 20 something who goes undercover as a teen. Technically, it counts as teenangst because of the supporting characters (who are outsiders, jocks, or teen queens), and yet doesn't because the journey of self-discovery is all the 20-something girl's. It's similar in theme to <i>Mean Girls</i> (and predates it).

"event","<P>Certain individuals on a certain&nbsp;message board on a certain website which shall remain unnamed just can't seem to get that whatever problems the stories in DC and Marvel have,&nbsp;it's not because the superhero, as a story genre, is inherently a bad mode for storytelling.

<lj-cut>

In fact superheroes are one of the oldest, most universal, and strongest types of storytelling, including the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, and probably even earlier than that. I feel compelled to clarify this right now, since I'm upset with DC Comics. The problems with the Batman books right now has nothing to do with the genre itself and everything to do with&nbsp;poor creative decisions. A genre is only as good as what's being written/done within it.

My lurking on message boards the last few days has turned up&nbsp;independent title fans who, on hearing of the problems DC is having, sniff and dismiss it as <EM>it's just a superhero book, therefore it sucks no matter what, why bother</EM>, DC Comics readers who think that the very plot twists that put me into a rage are <EM>really great stuff</EM>, some DC Comics readers who are really, really angry, and a sprinkling of middle-of-the-road <EM>I love superhero books but I'm just not comfortable reading this anymore but I'm polite</EM>. 

It's all subjective, I know, but I can't shake a strong sense that those of us who have read what we've read and have the discussions we've had and understand the characters as we've understood them are the ones who can see that what's going on now is distorted, a twisted version of the fictional universe we've come to know and love. That's&nbsp;insular.&nbsp;It's how I feel<EM>.</EM>

(Am I obsessing? Of course I am, it's me. Hopefully it's a constructive sort of obsessing.)

For the time being, I've decided to drop all the monthlies I'm buying&nbsp;except one (uh-huh, yes, of course <EM>that </EM>one).

Someone let me know when it's safe to come back.

[ETA: by ""read"" I mean, having absorbed in some way. I've been heavily influenced by the animated stuff.]

"event","<P>Remember my no-spoiler policy? Well, now there's going to be a great big exception to that rule, because of DC Comics and Infinite Crisis. <lj-cut text=""There are reasons why."">

This Infinite Crisis thing has me wondering how much longer I'm going to read the DCU comics. At all. <lj user=""doeeyedbunny""> once told me that she&nbsp;stopped reading X-Men when the continuity just got too snarled and messed up&nbsp;to follow anymore. I'm feeling like I'm going to hit the same wall with the DCU, that once IC hits, I'm going to throw up my hands and give up trying to pull coherent character arcs out of the chaos.

It's the rumors that tipped me off. None of them may end up being true. It's very likely none of them are true, but it's giving me a taste of what sort of animal Infinite Crisis will be for the batfamily.

There's one rumor that's fantastic and if it turns out to be true, I will read avidly, because, wow, it's a good one.

There are two rumors that would make me drop the universe like a hot potato. One is so patently ridiculous it's not worth worrying about. The other may also be just as ludicrous, except DC has already done something just as bad in my view. I'd already stopped reading the main Batman books when it happened, but if I hadn't, maybe it would have driven me away. I don't know. It's something that clashes badly with my understanding of how these characters and universe worked up to that point, and the only way I can keep reading the sidekick books is to stick my fingers in my ears and go ""lalalalala!"" After Infinite Crisis, the din may grow so loud I have to get out.

I've only been reading comics since 1996 or so. I can only imagine how someone who's been reading this stuff for 30 years or so might feel. But even if I've only been reading for about 10 years, the actual span of the books I've read is about 20. (Well, really it's 50, if you count the reprint I read, but for real character and story-arc reading, it's 20.)

It's just an odd feeling. The idea of getting off the train and simply rereading all the issues I already have is&nbsp;very appealing right now. But we'll see, I'm not making a fannish ultimatum, just speculating.

Be wary of spoilers in the comments, there may be discussion of rumors.

"event","Because I watched the director's cut of <EM>Donnie Darko</EM> last weekend, and&nbsp;discovered again that I love that movie,&nbsp;I've been <lj-cut text=""thinking about the best teen-angst films ever and why I'm so fixated on them"">.

The fact is that the teen-angst movies are generally popular. So it's probably not something that's, you know, just me. But I can't generalize about everyone else who loves these movies but for myself, I've come to the conclusion that because adolescence was such a bumpy ride and so very miserable, that I'm left obsessing for the rest of my life about the causes, effects, emotions, and post-traumatic stress. It's like after a horrible accident, you review what happened in your mind, hoping to make sense of the chaos.

These don't all strictly qualify as <EM>angst.</EM> They're just my favorite movies that take an interesting look at teenage characters, usually with lots of emotional agony but sometimes with silliness.

In&nbsp;chronological order (mostly Spoiler-free observations, except possibly the ending of <EM>Pretty in Pink</EM>):

 Rebel without a Cause (1955) The king of all teen angst movies, and beyond my capacity to explain the greatness of.

West Side Story (1961) They're pretty, they're in love, they're miserable, there's singing and fighting and dancing and the hell of trying to fit in and find someone you love, with the racial angle bringing the search to belong to a literal level.

The Outsiders (1983) In every way the love-child of <EM>Rebel </EM>and <EM>West Side Story</EM>. Stay gold, Ponyboy, stay gold...::sob::

Sixteen Candles (1984) This qualifies as angst because of the humiliation&nbsp;and the quest for the unattainable love object.

The Breakfast Club (1985) Big ball o' angst. There's sobbing and confessing and screaming and cursing and dialogue, dialogue, dialogue. Plus the archetype Bad Boy.

Weird Science (1985) Not angst, except for the humiliation, but belongs on a list with movies that emotionally torment teens, because it's a revenge fantasy. It's also fun to watch.

Pretty in Pink (1986) We all know this movie ended <EM>wrong</EM>, right?

Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) This is like the uber teen movie. I've heard Ferris Bueller described somewhere as some kind of&nbsp;teen superhero.&nbsp;Those teens in the other movies in the John Hughes' canon need Ferris to save <EM>them. </EM>Ferris himself has no angst. All of the emotional misery is channeled into&nbsp;his sidekick Cameron (because it's all about the sidekicks).

Some Kind of Wonderful (1987)&nbsp;Love this almost as much as&nbsp;<EM>The Breakfast Club</EM>. Oh, <EM>such</EM>&nbsp;angst. It's got the outsider theme&nbsp;from <EM>Rebel Without a Cause</EM>, it's got the Romeo and Juliet-themed romance from <EM>West Side Story</EM>, it's got the humiliation and disenchantment and quest for the unattainable object&nbsp;from <EM>Sixteen Candles</EM>, it's got the dialogue and angst from <EM>The Breakfast Club</EM>, it's got the revenge from <EM>Weird Science</EM>, and it rights the wrong that was the ending of <EM>Pretty in Pink</EM>. It's every teen movie ever made until Super Ferris showed up.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) This is on the list because I happen to think Joss Whedon's original movie was funny and intriguing, even though the actual concept of what he was really trying to do doesn't successfully come across until the tv series. The TV series should be on my list as the all-time ultimate teen-angst thing, but it's TV and I'm trying not to cheat. I have no evidence Joss Whedon was thinking of the John Hughes canon. I know for a fact, because he said so, Buffy was a response more to the girl in&nbsp;most horror movies. But I wonder if it was a response to teen angst films as well. <EM>Buffy</EM>&nbsp;the movie took a character who up to that point in movies was always the villainess--the popular cheerleader, the teen queen who was a foil to the more quirky and adorable plain girl--and made her the heroine. <EM>Buffy</EM>&nbsp; the tv series first stripped that character of her crown, still made her the heroine, and ironically gave her as a foil <EM>another </EM>teen queen popular cheerleader character. Meanwhile the sidekick characters moved into the spotlight. <EM>Buffy</EM>&nbsp;the TV series (not the movie) was never really about defeating the monsters or saving the world, but the struggles of growing up.

I also&nbsp;got a big <EM>Rebel </EM>vibe off of <EM>Buffy. </EM>They even&nbsp;had an&nbsp;abandoned mansion where the lovers could secretly meet. It's interesting that it's the girl who comes to town and&nbsp;shakes up&nbsp;the lives of the ordinary kids who already live there, while in <EM>Rebel </EM>IIRC, it's the guy. Also, Buffy would appear to be only the second significant appearance of the Super Teen after Ferris (in movies).

Donnie Darko (2001) This is&nbsp;the third example of the&nbsp;Super Teen.&nbsp;The twist&nbsp;is that Super Teen is neurotic. Or maybe he's the only sane one. We're never sure.&nbsp;Like Buffy, it takes Donnie a while to figure out what his destiny really is. The movie has a lot of the classic teen angst elements: revenge, outsider, disenchantment, emotional misery. Then it goes places few movies in any genre ever go, let alone the teen stuff. I'd put it in a teen marathon, though because it's really about all of those themes.&nbsp;

That also made&nbsp;me think of <EM>Back to the Future</EM> which may or may not belong on the list of ultimate teen movies of all time.&nbsp;<EM>Future</EM> has a strong central teen character and covers everything from bullies to oedipal complexes. It's got the outsider.

Also, <EM>The Outsiders</EM> plays a little with the Super Teen idea, in that teens do something heroic. ""You were always heroes. You didn't just become heroes all of a sudden"" (I'm paraphrasing)

</lj-cut>

I expect spoilers for each film&nbsp;could end up in the comments, however, so be wary."

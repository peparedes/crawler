my words have been my doom.
i wish to take them back-
the ones that have caused pain.
i wish to take away the fear
the shield, that hides my heart again.
ive tried to write it over, 
but each time i will fail.
i try to find the words to say- 
but the silence does prevail.
i try to drive the fears away
but still they come; like falling rain
taking my strength: my courage wont stay-
in the world that i so choose.

""she lays in bed each night
watching the star lite sky
she thinks of all her life
all the choices in her path
the road before her eyes
her happiness to decide
the risks-denied- the times shes tried
the pain shes felt so deep inside
but most, the roads, herself shes closed
for FEAR of loss and FEAR of woes
her head starts racing
and her heart beat pacing
as she looks out to the world shes facing,
does she risk it all and mayb be denied

Distance

""the distance in miles on an empty road
 distance in heartbeats always unknown
i give my heart to you without a doubt
i give my heart to you fears without
silence the crowds, stamp away fears
silence the crowds, our time is here
my wish for you is for you to know
that i am here now never to go 
please try not to doubt me
cause there is something here, you see
we saw it before, but it was too late
this time around lets not make that mistake
a whisper in the wind 
soft and gentle like your touch
a whisper in the wind
a breath between us never too much
the distance in miles on an empty road
distance in heartbeats let it be known.""

in the cold of the night with the wind blowing strong
when the air is so chilled it can freeze to the bone
theres always been a place inside for u to come to 
to wash away tears and push away all your fears 
to release the weigh of the world -
sometime to unfold
but this shelter it seems has become liek a dream
and its fault can be laid upon us all inbetween
who have faltered and let our truest friends down
those who feel like they would rather drown-
than to leave our best friends amongst the cold night
when they need us the most- for shelter and light.

""Shield""

of all the stupid things to say
of all the ways to be uncool
this is the one that i chose
those words were my doom
i wish to take them back
all the ones that cause pain 
i wish to take away the fear
the shield, that hides my heart again
ive tried to write it over and over
but each time i will fail
i try to find the words to say im sry
but nothing comes out but silence
im more afraid of losing u 
then any other thing i can imagine
u make me laugh and u make me happy
u take away the pain ive felt
but the fears- they come
of losing the feeling, of losing the high
so i want to make it up to u 
i waant to let u know i care
i want to tell u how i feel 
ruining this is more than i can bare
and what we have is very real
so i ask for forgiveness for hiding and running
i ask for forgiveness for wanting to think
i ask for forgiveness for being so stubborn
and i ask for forgiveness for messing up big
i pray for a chance to take it all back
i pray for a chance to forget the past
of all the stupid things to do
the one i chose is losing you.

she looks in the mirror - sees scars and pain,

she turns to herself-sees emptiness haunting

Alone
the past creeps down upon me every single tiem-i try to speak i try ot think the words are lost within
the one good thing gets hidden deep within yourself as your head fights off your heart that just waants one chance to yell
all alone in safe and hiding the world is far from sight and all alone is how ill stay no one with me- day and night.

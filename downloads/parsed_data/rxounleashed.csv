No one knows you anymore. You dont know anyone anymore. (Not enough to confide in anyone anyway) You dont even know yourself anymore. Funny how time changes things."

"event","Well i had a nice long weekend away. It was really kewl just to do nothing! I even started reading a book! Shock horror! We had some kewl little adventures. 
Toby and I went to Lennox Heads, it is a nice little town with very few people and shops, nice beach, but was too windy to swim, and it's close to Bryon and Ballina. 
I thought it was a nice weekend. Toby took me, he's so lovely. So cute too. I really enjoy spending time with him, and feel all happy and shit! lol. 

Rar! Well It's only two weeks until we go now. EIK!!!"

"event","<p>... things are going really great atm.&nbsp;<br /><br />Toby is awesome.&nbsp;Work is shite, but that's normal.&nbsp;<br /><br />My weekend was great, well i spent most of it with Toby, just doing stuff together. Which was realyl kewl. I feel like I've known him for months and months, not such a short period of time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Work, well blargh. I've been shunted down the back to teh freight station. Not so bad, cause Toby's down there, not that we get to talk during the day anyways, and I really dont want him to get sick of me, so hopefully, things'll be fine.&nbsp;<br />I'm doing someone's job who quiet, i've been lift to figure it out for myself basically since no one really knows what went on. LOL. yipee. <br /><br />Other - I havne't really tlaked to my parents much altely, maybe this is normal. But i live in teh same house? WTF. Meh, i'm trying. but I guess maybe i'm just too tired or something.&nbsp;<br /><br />As for you guys, was ncie to do dinner Monday, but apart from that haven't seen you that much.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sorry to hear about Jo, she was our age, that's a terrible loss.&nbsp;<br /><br />RXO </p>"

"event","Well It's ten weeks today till Steph and I go to Europe, OMG! 
I can't believe it's snuck up on us that quickly. It seems like only yesterday we were booking and planning stuffs. :-) And now we're off. I can't belive I've done it as it is! LOL.

Well, quite a few things are going on ATM besides Europe...

We've moved house. To Thornlands. 
It's a nice house, not as big as the old one, and still doesn't feel like home yet, but give it time and it will I guess, I've lived in the other one all my life so I can't expect it to happen overnight. 

Also, I've met someone kewl. 
That's all I'm saying so I don't jinx it. It's awesome, except I'm going to Europe in 10 weeks, and I'll be gone for 5 months, and I can't possibly expect someone to wait that long for me to get back. But I think we're taking it one day at a time and we will see what happens.

My bike is being looked after by Scotts dad. Which is nice, so it'll be happy and safe while I'm away. And my car is gone, yes I sold my baby, sniff. 

Steph and I are having a going away Party, I will keep you updated.

Also, Jamie when's the next board games night? I found some more!! he he. :-) 

Well that's about it for now. Bwah ha ha."

"event","i have found god. not in the born-again judeo-christian sense, but in the culinary sense.

many times i have eaten malaysian food at a place called penang village in san jose, and it has always been a delight to my tongue.

i have finally found a place that trumps it.

welcome to the spice islands cafe, downtown mountain view. 

aside from the awesome interior decor that crosses southeast asian and californian contemporary lines, the food is tremendously tasty, excitingly exotic, and disturbingly delicious.

malaysian style coconut scallops, beef rendang, nasi lemak, coconut rice, shrimp rolls, basil chicken and malaysian style spareribs.

mmm."

"event","i sit here with a million thoughts running through my mind, and i can't stop them. i want to sleep but i'm busy prying into the lives of friends past by reading their work online, i'm busy wondering where my damn ammunition is and why ups hasn't delivered it yet. i'm busy wondering when i should pay the stacks of parking tickets i have from those bastard cops in the city.

i sit and wonder and i don't know why and i have no idea what i'm doing with my life right now, but i know that what i'm doing is all i can do until i figure it out but i have no motivation right now even though i had it an hour ago and it's all bleeding away slowly into oblivion, a sweet oblivion that i won't know until the day i die.

i wonder if people truly sit and don't think beyond their latte or their duvet cover or their new ikea dinner table they assembled themselves and wonder what it's truly like to live and be free and to do what you want.

i wonder if people truly just go with the flow with no rhyme or reason but to stick to the plan of buying and fucking and eating and laughing and crying and spending and fucking some more.

then i look around me and realize that i've been doing the same thing for so long, how could i give it up? but maybe it's the same as someone who's been in a crappy relationship for so long- they don't know anything else.

i want to look outside the box more than i have, more than the little pinhole or crack. i want to see the box for what it really is, like neo wanted to know what the matrix was. i want to understand who is doing what and why but it's out of my grasp. i want to play the trombone and the bass and photograph things and build race cars and drive them and direct movies and act and sing and design but it's all just lost because i can't do it all right?

"event","the sky heaved and sighed forth a cascade of dewy droplets so large they shimmered silver in the bright beams of my headlights as i hurtled at exceptional speed up the freeway in my glass and steel beast, taunting death to do his worst. thoughts ran through my head as my forearms flexed to keep the car steady as i glided through patches of water threatening to throw me off course and send me into steel and concrete dividers. 

whenever the rain falls heavy i smile to myself but in sad introspection and realization more than happiness for the precipitation. i wondered and asked myself why it was that i can sit back and relax and enjoy the simple pleasure of wrapping myself in moments of guilty pleasure like an inviting blanket than keep focused on the inequities of the world. why i sit back and let myself get a fucking blowjob and cry out in ecstasy when i could be doing something productive. 

but then the rocket in my mind travels as fast as i do when i invite death to my doorstep, and perhaps at that moment since they are both traveling equally as fast i am completely free of thought and able to focus on the moment.

freeing your mind is difficult- you must try your best to let go of the stupid little thoughts that sidetrack you, you must have resolve and constitution to maintain along the path of righteousness. i guess i don't have the chops yet, because all i can think about is the rain and getting another blowjob tonight."

OMG!!!), the nasty ones, the depressed ones, the accounts of the holiday rush and of the emotions that follow, the happy ones and overjoyed ones.

this is pretty much all of those combined.

i guess it all boils down to one thing- doing my best to make everyone happy, which is what i always try to do. i enjoy putting a smile on someone's face with the thoughtfulness of a gift or what have you but the bank account has been finding itself slim recently and my plans to slowly collect christmas gifts for people over the course of the year crashes and burns inevitably as usual.

but it's whatever.

so this year i'm done, and done quick. shopping wasn't bad and my procrastination didn't force me to endure too much pain, for which im thankful.

and on top of that i found out that i can legally administer weddings in california. 

fucking awesome.

merry christmas to you, christians and non-christians alike. all i can ask of you is to smile at the guy or girl next to you when you're out there braving the world so they know that they are alive and real and that there are other people in the world they can connect with.

"event","so you're a skeptic. you don't want or can't believe that bush, cheney, et al are abusing government policy to censor, to expand imperialistically, to seek out and secure oil and to screw everyone out of money so the rich can benefit.

that's fine. i can understand how it's hard for you to see that. so i will play a game i like to call connect the dots. i will do my best to source all of my information and provide links to those sources, so that you can verify what i say is true before you attempt to debate me.

so without further ado-

<lj-cut text=""play connect the dots with me"">

so i bring a few preposterous proposals to the table. 

one, that bush and company are out to secure world oil reserves for the US and to lie to you in the process of doing so in an effort to make imperialistic gain seem humanitarian and righteous.

two, that bush and company have willfully engaged in policies of deception to the american people, fueled by self-censorship of the media in what amounts to no less than indirect bribery, and that you are not supporting what you think you are.

three, that this is nothing new and that specific members and groups of the far right wing have been plotting these things for decades, ever since the nixon administration or perhaps earlier.

four, this is not a huge conspiracy theory- instead it is the willful actions of distinct small groups or single members all acting in self interest that happens to coincide with the self interests of others and thus seeming like a big conspiracy.

i will begin with one, just because thats where you usually begin.

when you look at what the bush administration has been focusing on, it's hard to put the pieces of the puzzle together until you look at a map. in fact, when you think of afghanistan and iraq, you don't think of either being anywhere near the other. 

recent news has suggested that the us is taking a harsh stance against iran, against what the un and the eu seems to wish. the us has since the bush administration targeted <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1796034.stm"">iran as part of the ""Axis of Evil"" along with already conquered iraq, and north korea</a>.

funny thing, isn't it? that bush, after taking afghanistan, would lump iran and iraq together into an axis of evil and therefore give us political motivation to go to war and ""liberate"" their people?

so hard to understand after looking at this map?

<img src=""http://www.norcalneco.com/meastpol.gif"">

well looky here. iraq and afghanistan are seperated by only one country, and that's iran. and what does iran border as well? turkmenistan and the caspian sea.

lets review about the caspian sea:

prior to the war in afghanistan, the decision to build a gas pipeline across afghanistan from turkmenistan was shaky because of <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/analysis/16777.stm"">political instability</a>. who was to say whether or not the northern alliance leaders would hold the pipeline hostage as a way to bribe the u.s.? who is to say the taliban wouldn't do the same? in 1997, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/west_asia/37021.stm"">taliban leaders</a> came to texas for discussions on such a pipeline.

in that article, unocal identifies that it has agreements with totalitarian dictatorship turkmenistan to sell its gas and a deal with pakistan to buy it, but afghanistan was required in order to build the pipeline and transfer these goods.

what better way for american business to securely transfer natural gas resources from caspian sea country turkmenistan to pakistan than to take over and ""liberate"" the country in the middle, then install a us friendly government and stock the nation full of us soldiers.

in a <a href=""http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-dc062398.html"">speech to the CATO institute</a>, a right wing think-tank, then-ceo of halliburton vp dick cheney said:

""An example that comes immediately to mind has to do with efforts to develop the resources of the former Soviet Union in the Caspian Sea area. It is a region rich in oil and gas. Unfortunately, Iran is sitting right in the middle of the area and the United States has declared unilateral economic sanctions against that country.""

funny then that when he became vp, cheney would support harsher sanctions against the very country he wanted us to relax sanctions on.

now lets look at other central asia countries, especially turkmenistan.

according to <a href=""http://www.fas.org/asmp/resources/govern/108th/sjres3is.htm"">S. J. Res 3</a> turkmenistan and uzbekistan are both serious human rights violators with totalitarian governments.

turkmenistan in particular is ruled by a 'president' niyazov, a man who rules the country with an iron fist and a personality cult of exhaustive proportions. no independent media, no opposition parties, no traide unions, internet access is tightly controlled, foreign newspapers strictly forbidden. opera and ballet have been banned, and this former soviet republic closed all concert halls, circuses and their academy of sciences. 

in fact, niyazov (the great turkmenabashy) replaced any turkmen culture with the Ruhnama, his own personal book of spiritual sayings.

despite having a high poverty rate, the us government gave 5 times as much money to them (1.1 million) for security and police aid than they did humanitarian (0.2 million), figures from the <a href=""http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/fs/35991.htm"">state department</a> itself.

in fact according to a profile by the <a href=""http://www.newint.org/"">new internationalist</a> on the country, the state department rewarded turkmenistan for its cooperating during the operation in afghanistan by refusing to list it on its 2002 list of ""countries of particular concern"" over the infringement of religious liberties, even though it has the worst record on religious freedom in the former soviet union.

now about iran.

why is iran next on the list? in addition to being included in the list of countries part of the ""axis of evil"", several permanent military bases are being constructed in iraq. funny thing that the beginning of next year will mark the first time that squadrons of ea-6b prowler aircraft (meant only for two things- jamming enemy radar while protecting an incoming squadron of bombers and blowing up enemy radar/anti-aircraft sites) will arrive in iraq.

last i checked, the insurgents in iraq don't have large antiaircraft platforms. but the funny thing is...

iran does.

you be the judge.
--------

so maybe now you can start to see the connection. major oil companies formerly controlled by current government officials stand to profit from current policies and expansion. with iran next on the list, the us government will have easily and officially installed a series of us-supporting governments from the caspian all the way to pakistan, the country we used to funnel money to al qaeda during the soviet attack on afghanistan in the 80s, in order for us oil companies such as halliburton and unocal make money.

call me paranoid, but i like to see it as connecting the dots.

the other parts will come soon.

i hate the way it makes you feel, the imbalance you have in your body where your energy seems to have been permanently lost, your ability to function in any task besides sleeping seems futile and the simple desire to be out and happy is destroyed forever.

or at least it seems that way.

the worst part about getting sick for me is the complete and utter loss of sex drive. i can't mentally conjure a single lascivious carnal image to stir ""the fire in the loins"" so to speak. nothing at all. i had a pair of lovely naked breasts in my face this morning and all i could do was smile and say ""wow, those are great. want to discuss philosophy?""

need release, need to clear my head. maybe visit my friend and bring a little more e so we can both enjoy a couple hours of sensory bliss and carnal pleasure. i want something new though, something different. 

its a lost cause, im stuck in a loop and can't get out. one to the next to the next, then back around again. i get bored too easy, tired of the same thing. i like exciting and new and i like to bring the new and exciting to others.

weird headaches too, they come in spikes. a few seconds then gone, then fine for hours and hours and hours and hours. and no, its not the e or anything else because i dont take it, just the cute little fuckbunny i've been messing around with.

so i was standing around in the lobby of some kind of strange two-winged building, where one wing was a media school where they teach people how to be things like radio announcers and tv producers. the other wing was a drug rehab center, kinda.

so im standing around and then seth green walks up to me and asks me quietly if i know where i can get some crack. i told him in a very brad-pitt-in-twelve-monkeys kind of way that if he's here for help he should stay away from the crack dealers cuz they're everywhere and you can't get away from them and it's weird because even if you arrest one twenty seconds later a new one pops up to take his place kinda like hydra except just one instead of two so they don't replicate.

and he laughed, and said he wanted and needed help so i helped him sign in to the program and he kissed his little asian girlfriend goodbye for a couple of weeks and she had a sad but concerned look on her face when she went away and the lady behind the counter asked me if i would be his sponsor because he's signing up for the rehab program and i was like yeah, sure, i guess that's fine.

then i woke up.

the weird part? at no point did i say to myself in my dream ""woah, im sponsoring seth green to check into a drug rehab clinic for a crack addiction"".

"event","it seems im not the only one out there with the notion that near-complete social breakdown is inevitable within the next two years as a worst case scenario resulting from the ""election"" of bushie again.

even hardcore republicans who decided to vote for kerry instead of corruption share my thoughts, nra-member, rifle and handgun carrying pubbies. adequately enough, someone broke down the three levels of self defense.

i. forcible entry into your home requiring you to utilize a firearm to defend yourself
ii. localized social breakdown requiring you to defend yourself during an escape from the immediate area
iii. total social breakdown requiring you to defend yourself either during escape or while staying put

for these reasons i've been visiting the shooting range recently, because it's been years since i've used a firearm and wanted to brush up on my skills. i am thankful that a majority of my close friends are all firearm owners and/or users and can hold their own if they had to. it may sound like the words of the paranoid, but i have three general locations to evacuate and regroup to, as well as a small ""breakout bag"" of supplies should i find myself in a situation where this is necessary.

in addition, i am purchasing my first firearm in the next month, a small rifle. the ruger pc9 is a superb short-medium range defense weapon that uses the same magazines as the ruger line of 9mm pistols, and the ammunition, being 9mm pistol ammo, is cheap and readily available should you need to acquire some during this time period.

so now that you think im crazy, realize this.

the government as it exists as of current lies to you. it lies to you in many different ways by many different people because they all have individual agendas to fulfill regarding power and wealth as well as imperialistic supremacy. this is a problem because eventually it will become exposed somehow and cause social unrest. once the social unrest begins, then the government response begins and it eventually leads to the downfall of the united states social structure leading to things like localized declarations of martial law in order to keep riots at bay and the media clamped down.

it lies to you about what happened leading up to 9/11 and it lies about the events afterwards. it lies about why things happened the way they happened and why they let it happen. 

i know, i know, im crazy. but ive read the facts (and no i have never seen that atrocious movie farenheit 9/11) and i come up with logical results from the factual input into the equation of who what when where why and how. if you read this, be ready. be ready at the very least with supplies and a way to run. if you don't believe in owning a gun or can't for some reason please at least take one or two firearms training classes. many local gun ranges hold them for free. this is not a joke, this is a real warning.

be safe, and keep an eye out for the next year and a half. they may sneak things in so slowly you don't even notice at first until everything you know is gone and fed into the corporate structure of greed, the equation that means one thing- money and power and control for the few who already have more than enough of all.

so im like shit i already got a cat i cant have anymore i have no place to put them maybe i should just flush the toilet so i do but it doesnt work and they crawl out and all sit down around the toilet and they all look like my sister's stupid bastard of a cat so i go next door to the clean apartment 300 and borrow a box and come back to put the kittens in it so i can take it downstairs.

and then suddenly im downstairs but im outside because we're kinda in japan but we're kinda not because there are a ton of japanese restaurants and they are very vivid but its kind of a weird twisted part of disneyland actually and even though i've seen this place in my dream before its different this time because the windows for the apartment building above the food pavilion area with all the japanese stores has had rocks thrown through its windows like we're living in the ghetto now or something.

and now im not in the military anymore im here because we decided to go to disneyland before we go to watch the <a href=""http://www.jgtcusa.net"">JGTC race</a> and i get lost trying to get back to my apartment and end up getting into this elevator that is more of a weird kind of monorail that goes without any kind of strings or tracks and this lady is getting in with another lady and they are german and a kid is getting on with them but then they decide no this isn't the elevator for them and the lady and the kid get off but the other lady looks like she doesnt realize she has to step all the way out the door like maybe she forgot so the door closes on her but she's not in pain and we help push her out.

but this elevator doesnt go where we want so i end up back in the parking lot where i get a call on my cellphone and it's my buddy jason who i haven't talked to in oh probably five years maybe six yeah more like six and he asks me about whats going on and if we want to hang out with him at disneyland today since we're here and he's here he must've seen my car because how else would he know i'm here right and i tell him that i brought my laptop with me and i give him a joking wink and nudge and say ""dude i got like eighteen gigs of mp3's on it"" and he jokingly says something like ""well i guess i know where i'm staying tonight"" and everything is fine until my cat meows and i wake up.

i kinda wish i had stayed in that dream, it was bizarre and i don't remember all of it but holy christ i have never remembered a dream so vividly before."

it feels good because there is a singular moment where you are not thinking about it but you are and then it comes to be when you realize that you exist as a singular being here and now not later not before because the past is no longer and the future does not yet exist and so you smile because you are here and the universe is here but thats all that is here and nothing less but you and the nothingness around you but you frown because of the same fact they both cancel each other out and you realize that it's just you and the universe whether the universe be god or allah or yahweh or the great other or the great nothing but at the same time you cant help but sit there and think to yourself wow it all exists but it doesnt so why the hell do i need to be unhappy about not being happy or happy about not being unhappy and just focus on the one part about both of those statements that is static and unchanging and never moving

not being

and so you realize that by not being you are being because things are defined not by their shape or form but by the empty space around them because a room is not big or small unless you have the empty space between the walls to define them and you cant determine how far away something is without empty space between you and the other and so its emptiness and fullness that complement each other in a way that two souls can never do because they never acknowledge the existence of another and maybe thats how two conjoined souls should be so that they best define each other by never acknowledging one another or maybe thats the way to avoid the entire thing from starting in the first place in which case we would never exist but we do exist so therefore we are and therefore we are not but it doesnt matter because the only similarity between the two that is static and unchanging and never moving

therefore

you are what you arent and you arent what you are because you are everything and nothing all at once and this repetitiveness is getting tired because it really all boils down to one singular thing that nobody not even me can truly grasp except that you have this feeling inside of total contentment but emptiness because you are not really happy nor are you sad and you do not want but you do not wish to give up and you are not jealous but you are not so loving but you accept everything for what it is and try your hardest to be good and so you are nothing but one thing that is static and unchanging and never moving

nothing at all"

"event","I hate election day this year. It leaves me with this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach because of the future I know is coming yet I am still optimistic and hope for the best.

It's funny and sad at the same time, I guess, and I'm really not sure what to think of it all. There are moments when I'm filled with happiness, like the moment my mother told me she was going to register to vote. My mother, of all people, who has always said her vote doesn't count. There are hundreds of thousands, even millions of people like this who think the same, but this time around they've changed their minds.

Whether it's blind faith, logic and reasoning, love and compassion or hatred and fear that drive them to the polls, people are spilling out by numbers never seen before to make themselves part of the vaguely democratic process of choosing our next employee of the year, the guy who is supposed to do stuff for us, our next President.

Then there are moments that sadden me, like when I can't make a blind-faith Bushie see logic, and regardless of conceding to my points of logic they say ""But I'm voting for him anyway"". It makes me wonder deep inside if there is something else I could've done. But I know there isn't. After all, if one isn't willing to listen to logic after admitting you are wrong, then what else can be done to change your mind?

So, today is the day. The day the people will voice their opinion on whether or not they wish to continue to follow this blind path of darkness lead by GWB, or if they choose to venture along the unknown trail, realizing that things could be worse but how could they not be at least a little better? This is one of the most historic election days of our times- not just in the decision made but the fact that so many wanted their decision to be known.

But what will happen, is the question? Predicted by myself and a couple of others, despite the rallying support for Kerry, mitigating factors will cause Bush to win his second term. This second term will lead us further into war and strife in the middle east and see a rise in terrorism at home which will result in further fascist policy being made and approved. 

The citizenry won't stand for it, of course, and it will result in at least civil unrest but at worst civil war, sending the world into a new dark age as a great majority of economies are dependent on our own.

Rising from the ashes of this civil unrest will be corporations, the giant teddy bears here to coddle you with soothing shiny products of epic expenditure and indenture you to their servitude in the name of making more money for whomever is on top. 

I hope Kerry wins. Don't you?"

"event","i leave the radio station and walk down the street towards my car.

as usual it's about 0300PDT and i run into the usual beggar. i think to myself that tonight i will play a little game, because while i have come down a long road to becoming an honest, honorable guy, being skilled in deception is a survival skill, one you can use in dire straits to get your ass out of the fire.

i chat with the guy after walking up towards him with the usual swagger of a street-savvy guy you'd find in san francisco in the wee hours of the morning. i'm smoking a cigarette, which will inevitably prompt the question from a beggar, ""hey man can you spare one of those for me?""

of course i offer, but i say, ""well i can spare one if you got a quarter,"" to begin setting up for the character i've decided to play. this seeds the man immediately with the thought that i'm obviously a smart business-minded guy; i won't just hand out a cigarette but i'll offer one for some change.

he gladly gives me the quarter because one drug is just like another and seriously even though you can get a pack of cigarettes for less than four bucks and twenty cigarettes at twenty-five cents a pop is four-fifty, can he really hold onto his change long enough to buy his own pack? or maybe it's more than if he has a pack everyone will be asking him but if he buys or begs singles he'll do alright.

but anyway.

i offer to light it for him, setting myself in a slightly wider stance to express dominance. he thanks me profusely and i lean back against the wall to converse. he asks me what i'm doing around this part of town late at night and i tell him just business. 

he smiles a big smile, a hopeful one and asks if i sell crack. i explain to him i deal in bigger things and he smiles and nods though there's disappointment in his eyes like he thought maybe he was going to score a little more crack for the night.

i'm obviously not scared to converse with him so he doesn't write me off as somebody who doesn't belong here. he tells me his name is willie and i tell him mine is big mike. hey, all of the shady business guys have a little nick to their name and so i give one. we shake each other's hands street-style and he goes on about how it's been so damn cold the past couple nights and the crack dealers arent as frequent so he can't get a little high to get away from it all. then he asks what i do.

i tell him if he knows of anyone looking to score a little hardware to let me know, and he smiles with eyes real wide. he makes a gun with his hand and nods and i say bigger than that. good shit. german shit.

he says oh yeah like a ruger huh and i explain to him no, bigger. i tell him i mostly deal with suits and he seems to shrink a few inches like a dog who has just realized that the dog he's next to is bigger and in charge. he tells me if there's anything i need, anything at all just let him know he'll try to find it for me.

i nod to him and say a'ight and give him a goodbye handshake and say peace willie. he says see you later mister man and i walk towards my car.

the key to deception is to act. when you act you must become the character in every fiber of your being or you aren't believable. once you believe you are this character you can become this character and then you are believable and then you act and deceive.

it works. still."

"event","it's a bleak scene, 2:34 in the morning on market street. there's homeless people lined up huddled with each other against walls and in doorways to fend off the bitter breeze that whips up the canyon of asphalt carved between concrete, steel and glass. crackheads wander the street, talking to themselves or imaginary friends and often jesus.

one of them shouts up to the sky to say that even rich people need god to look after them. he implores him to be nice and to take care of all of us. hes stoned out of his mind and i give him 3 bucks. im on my way to the strip club after work to do a little market research, no joke. 

at 0234 i often find that charisma and instinct keep you safe and carry you a long way. at 0234 there arent people roaming the street, just animals. animals can smell fear. they see their prey and they stalk it for a while before going in for the kill. after leaving the strip club 40 bucks shorter (20 for the door 20 for a girl's lapdance followed by a nice long 30 minute conversation as im such a charming bastard sometimes, where we discussed politics and the business of stripping and prostitution) i head back down the street. 

on market street you run into many characters. and now it's 0316, so its later. i run into a guy named ray ray. he wants to know if i want some weed or some cocaine. or a watch, presumably traded for said weed or cocaine. i decide to play a role like i often do with these ones.

i have no fear when i walk down the street. i know i am safe because i can kick some ass. i dont walk with an air of superiority; rather, i fit right in. i walk around like the rest of the animals on their hind legs peddling their weed and their coke and their sex and their rock and roll and their watches and their bling. i walk around with the rest of the animals, just one of the pack. i walk around like i belong there, and they respect that. i get head nods from hardcore street thug niggahs who would otherwise smile toothy and wicked at a whiteboy walking down the street, thinking to themselves good, next meal.

i tell ray ray im feeling too sick to do any dope, as i was coughing (for show) while i walked up towards him in the first place. he says that the coke will make me feel like a million bucks, not sick. i say its coo but next time you got some weed and im around let me know. see, he explains that hes not a weed dealer, just coke. he happens to get weed in trade now and again from people in dire need of something more hardcore, like a guy who trades up two beers for a shot of tequila. 

another guy walks up, somebody ive met before. scrawny thug niggah named jt. i pound it with him when he offers his hand and suddenly ray ray backs off just a little bit. guess now im not prey, but now im some dude who knows some dude whos not just a chump. ray ray is still talking though. i give jt a dollar for 75 cents and discuss the barter and trade system with ray ray. jt follows for a bit and asks if he can get a ride if i got a car but i say im being picked up on the corner otherwise my ass wouldve been in my car already.

they laugh and ray ray walks me to the corner. tells me hes usually on turk and teller and to find him there.

im like.

aight. 

peace homes, god bless.

i give him a g-ass handshake and go to my car."

"event","So is it all just paranoid conspiracy-theory bullshit, or are these pieces on a chessboard being moved into play?

Sometime early next year there are plans to move a large squadron of Marine E6 Prowlers into airfields in Iraq. Now, you may write this off as ""Oh, well, yeah of course. They want to keep planes there to defend themselves and stuff.""

I don't doubt the logic behind that thought. But what you have to understand the mission role of the E6. The E6 is meant to jam radar so that bombers behind it can safely traverse enemy territory without the concern of surface to air missiles.

Last I checked, the Iraqi rebels don't have mobile or stationary SAM installations, and if they were worried about hand-fired rockets, they would have sent them before. This accompanied with a large movement of naval forces into the area leaves me concerned.

Concerned about what? It sounds to me like pieces are being put into play for the Next Target. I don't like that thought. Not one bit. Call me a worry-wort but it's just the truth. So what do I get out of all of this? A distinct sense of ""Why It Was Done"", or at least part of the reason.

Israel has long since been used by us as a 'forward base of operations' in the Middle East operational theater. But in order for us to use it offensively, we would need some serious permission from them. Why? Because the last time we used Israel for anything (Gulf War), they ended up with a few dozen SCUDs in their backyard. So what? Take over Iraq, of course. It solves two problems: 1- Iraq dropping SCUDs on your bases and encampments and 2- Getting permission from Israel.

So now we have this nice big cooperative and recently liberated sandbox under mostly our control in the middle of the Middle East. Iran is a neighbor, so is Syria, and others. Countries we really aren't too happy about. And now we're staging troops there, aircraft, and so forth. And not aircraft that would have any real effective use against unconventional combatants such as insurgent rebels but the kind used in more conventional warfare. Sounds like we used Iraq as a hopping-off point for the rest of the Middle East to me.

And another amusing thing. My friend in the Navy tells me there isn't going to be a new draft because the Navy is trying to cut back on personnel. But I work at a radio station part time and see a good number of brand new US Navy recruitment spots.

You do the math. :)"

Examples have been provided in the past, and tonight is no exception. But I'll get to that later.

So I go to a party. A friend's birthday party. To be exact, it's a birthday party for two friends and some random girl I don't know. The party was ""off the heezy fo' sheezy"" to quote the E-40 vernacular. We're talking about a 90-or-so person party with plenty of posers to laugh at and plenty of bitches to hit on. (Doesn't it just get you all hot when I call a collective group of women in short skirts and tight tops bitches?)

It was good, and I leave with satisfaction. But only because one of my small group were 5 months shy of 21, and unfortunately the Sheriff's department decided to come over to the party too.

Somebody had weed. Dumbasses. And because cops all have noses for weed like my fat cousin Frank has a nose for Krispy Kreme, the guy(s) get stopped, guns drawn on them, and searched/handcuffed/butt-fucked with a baton (Wait, this isn't New York...).

On the way to drop a friend off after the party as any good designated driver should do, I end up stopped at a stoplight. From the side of the road I hear someone yellow my name. I flip a bitch and pull into the gas station parking lot, only to be briefed and find out that there is indeed a friend in the back seat of this SUV and his girlfriend and homeboy were flipping out. Why? Because he had about 3/4 a bottle of goldschlager, a couple beers, and some pill and was hallucinating.

So, I give them advice, tell them to keep him hydrated and monitor his vitals, call an ambulance if anything gets worse and tell them to stop worrying and take care of the task at hand.

"event","When you're the target.

You can take it when you don't know the person and it isn't affecting your life.

You can take it a little less when it's an acquaintance.

It's harder to take from friends and close friends.

It's worse when it comes from family.

To know that your family talks shit about you behind your back is unbelievable. To know that they make judgments on your friends, your life and your lifestyle is devastating at best. And when they can keep it so quiet that you don't know until months later.. that's a tragedy.

So I'm having an argument with my sister over some DVD's she claims I might have. Simple really. I tell her that I don't, that when I borrowed them the cases were empty. She can't find them so obviously she wants me to look through my DVD's one more time, which I conveniently have located in several CD binders.

Well, to begin, let me explain.

I'm an observant person. My abilities of visual pattern recognition from an environmental snapshot are good. Damn good. And I honestly don't brag seriously about much. I notice when things are out of place. I notice when things don't belong. And considering I carefully hand-packed those CD binders only with DVDs that I would want to watch while at work, I would notice if something was out of place.

She knows this. But she doesn't trust my judgment, so she asks me politely if I can take a look one more time. It's obfuscation; she's hiding the fact that she doesn't trust me by trying to ask me politely. When I tell her she's telling me that I'm not trustworthy, she balks. Of course she's not saying that. But after it erupts into an argument as families tend to do now and again, I find out that I am right. 

She calls into question my friends. Tells me how I hang out with the wrong people, the wrong girls, that people use me. That she is worried that I'm going to make mistakes.

Use me? She's never met a single friend. She's making this judgment call based on what? On a picture she's seen of me drinking with some 21 year old friends of mine who happen to <b>look young</b>. This, coupled with a receipt for a pack of cigarettes she found in my wallet (I won't ask why she was looking in the first place) and a few bottlecaps found in my bag (Again, I won't ask) leads her to believe that I'm being used by 17 year old kids to buy alcohol and tobacco.

Uh.

I smoke. I drink. I go to parties and barbecues. I enjoy myself and I have fun. I have only once even gone on a date with someone under the age of 18 whilst I was over said age, more or less support the bad habits of those under that age. My only crime is that I once let my best friend's little brother (16) have a beer.

But are these acceptable answers to her? No, obviously I'm not trustworthy. I'm deemed a failure, a loser. I'm deemed as someone who is so gullible that he's obviously being used by a bunch of people pretending to be my friends.

Sorry dear, this isn't San Ramon. I don't have friends who come from rich parents who live fake lives and have fake friends and put on a pretend show everywhere they go.

But the real question is why does she make these assumptions? Because she feels that I'm too homely, lack too much personality, I'm too unskilled, I'm too stupid. Because she thinks that I'm weak enough of mind to befriend people who aren't really friends. She thinks I'm socially gullible and naive because I was when I was younger. 

Thanks sis. And thanks for telling me that you and Dad talk about these things with each other.

Grow some fucking balls and say something to my face. There is nothing I hate more than a shit talker. And that's all it is, because unless you know the whole story, unless you ask questions, unless you've met the people in question and you've asked me, that's all it is. Shit talking.

Fuck you.

You want to know the truth? The horrible truth?

I'm the exact fucking opposite of what you think. I'm a social chameleon. I blend in. I'm a manipulator. I get people to do what I want them to do. I don't spend money on anyone I don't consider family unless it's to influence them in some way. I'm a deceiver. I get people to do things for me just because. I take revenge on my social universe for what others have done to me so long ago. I am exactly what I hate and I love it and hate it at the same time. I do things to make ME feel good. I use people to make ME feel good. I fuck who I want or whomever I want to manipulate into it. I get people to give me money, to give me respect. I can get away with open-hand slapping someone in the face for them accidentally almost burning me with a cigarette butt, and they APOLOGIZE to ME.

So there. What do you think of them apples, bitch?

Fuck you and your judgments too. 

Time to call my dad and bitch him out now. :)"

Been up for over 24 hours now, sitting at Denver international airport waiting for my flight to arrive (30 minutes). I left Indianapolis around 6:20 in the morning (Indy time, that's 4:20 our time because those stupid bastard Indianianians don't respect Mr. Franklin's concept of Daylight Savings time. And they call themselves patriotic! Harumph), on a flight I wasn't expecting to take.

See, apparently today is the day everyone flies out of Indianapolis to somewhere else.


At O'Dark thirty in the fucking morning.

I get there at 5am for a 6:15 flight, and what happens? Sure enough, TSA (Transportation Security Agency) holds me up for 'special inspection', which includes a free in-flight anal cavity search and questions like ""Is this video camera real?"" But hey, I don't mind having a gloved hand stuffed up my cornhole. After all, it's just a rectum.

Reminds me of when I was abducted by aliens. (kidding. On both. Maybe)

I was disheartened to leave Indy, with so many really great people there. I had a superb time and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I drank myself into oblivion many times over, went to the titty bar with a few friends from the east coast, experienced the joys of Canadian beer and a Canadian cigarette all in the span of a little over 50 hours. I visited northern Illinois, eastern Wisconsin, central Indiana. I saw thunderstorms I can't even describe, rain I haven't seen in a while and most of all I did it on a budget of 47 dollars. Not including airfare.

In fact, I only spent 7 bucks at the strip club! I swear, Indianapolis has the best dollar/titty value ratio in the country. Before anyone gets excited, titty bars for me really aren't a big deal. It's a place to hang out with some friends (men and women, ahem) and entertain -them-. It takes a lot for a girl to turn me on, and honestly the majority of strippers couldn't elicit an erection from me if they tried.

What I do appreciate? The acting and athletic prowess of some of the dancers. Indy had fine examples of both. Favorites for the evening included 'Rhea' and 'Taylor', the former being a wild short-haired blonde (It's the short hair, damnit! And you know it, you little Russian minx ;)), the latter being a vaguely Avril Lavigne lookalike. Hell, my friend's husband even gave her money for a private lapdance. She really liked that one. ;)

I'm not quite sure how this turned into a discussion about the relative merits and demerits of the adult clothing-removal performance industry, but anyway.

Great picks on cool motherfuckers for the weekend: Terry, Ryan, Chris, Shawndra, Heather, Mary, Dan, Goose, Mike, Kenny. A toss up on a few others until I figure out what was going on with something...

Drinking. Woah. My last night here, I got drunk no less than 3 times, and sobered up. And got drunk again. Fucking great. It's hard to ride it out like that, but I managed.

And now, I sit and wait for my tubular chariot of flaming doom to thrust me forth into the skies and send me westward, heeding the tidings of our forefathers (Go WEST young man! Go WEST!) and barreling at high speed towards San Francisco, the city of Brotherly love. And sometimes Sisterly love. And sometimes just plain hot girl on girl action, sourdough bread, cable cars, urine-stench alleys and legal medical marijuana.

No matter how much I can't wait to get home, I wish I was here for a day longer."

So you're waiting for your plane, and you look outside and see it. A nice little 737 that's probably older than that 25 year old scotch you drank the night before. That unsettles me. I prefer to travel in vehicles younger than me.

Then, you sit in the seat. You feel that anxiety you always feel before a plane flight, the feeling of ""OH MY GOD IM GOING TO HURTLE MYSELF THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE IN A FUCKING ALUMINUM TUBE AT HIGH SPEED 33,000 FEET OFF THE FUCKING GROUND"" kind of feeling. 

Makes me wonder what kind of balls Apollo astronauts had to travel to the fucking moon in a VW beetle-sized craft. Probably giant government issue brassies.

But, I thusly hurtled.

<img src=""http://www.initialvelocity.com/inair.jpg"">

And now I'm rewarded by being in the Denver airport. Hello Colorado.

I miss the roadtrip. Though the beauty of the clouds and the ground from afar (scary afar) is wonderful, it's just no replacement for the camaraderie of a nice long roadtrip.

Sigh.

Oh well, never look a gift horse in the mouth. I have a videocamera for entertainment. Later folks."

[Public] Rhiana: ""Where the bitches at""? I don't even understand that in English. Well, I understand everything but ""at"". 
[Public] MacKenna: Well, to translate it to something in proper english as opposed to a more of a slang english, the phrase is 'Where are the bitches?'. In this case, bitches is used as a derogatory term for women in the sexual-object sense.
[Public] MacKenna: So, it's the equivalent of walking into a party, throwing up your arms, and shouting out, ""Greetings my fellow compatriots, where might I find the loose women I would like to engage in sexual intercourse with?"", except in a much cooler way. ;)"

"event","Like many other people these days between the ages of 16-30, I am a member of a car club. Not just any car club, but a car club devoted solely to the appreciation of a single generation of a long line of cars under the namesake 'Cougar'. I'm a member of NECO; New Edge Cougar Owners.

Because of this club, I was to embark on a historic journey that would take me 2253.9 miles across our great country, through states such as Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. You know. The collective gambling-drinking-hooking-polygamistic corn belt of America. And because of this club, I now know what it feels like to be the chick in the Houston 500.

So, you're asking yourself what the Houston 500 is. Sounds like a car race? Like the Indy 500? Not... quite.

The Houston 500 is the penultimate in debauchery and filth, brought to you in part by the Porn industry of our lovely country. The Houston 500 began as a legendary quest to defeat the world record for the largest gangbang (a salacious act of sexual misconduct represented by an orgy of grandiose scale).

This gratuitous sausage party is horrendous. Hundreds of naked men lined up along a wall, circled around the warehouse all waiting their turn to stuff their meat popsicle into any one of the 8 orifices women have been graced with by genetics at birth.

Thankfully, there's no nasal sex that I'm aware of, though I'm sure a google search will turn up a picture or two.

But I digress. Why the analogy between myself and the chick in the Houston 500? Because my club chapter decided to leave a day early for this cross-country trip without me.

<b>WITHOUT ME</b>

So kids, much like the porn star who can't really talk right now because her mouth is full of cock, I know what it feels like to be seriously <i>dicked</i>.

So tomorrow afternoon, I have a plane flight to Milwaukee where my great white nigger from the North will pick me up. Thursday morning we make the trip with several other cars to Indianapolis, where I will stay for a couple of days.

So hopefully this will be fun- I have a digicam and camcorder to document my trip. Even if it's just for me. Fuck them all. They weren't dicked like me and that chick.

Here's a link to a news story on the Houston 500, in case you're bored.

"event","Witness, one of the most spectacular examples of performing art in the world. It rivals all forms of theatre and dance. Comedy and drama. Satire and wit.

Witness the splendor of <a href=""http://www.doubledutchess.com/site.html"">double dutchess</a>.

If you have never seen them before, you are missing out. I have only seem then in video form in a couple of places, and I can't wait to see an actual performance.

So the question is, WTF are they?

Self proclaimed heartless frigid bitches and disobedient catholic schoolgirls, it's a group of attractive women performing the long lost art of....

Double Dutch jump-rope.

I know, I know. You question me. You ask, loz ok lus3r wtf!!??!?!1!11!11

I answer with an excerpt from the site and from what I've been told of an attendee of their so called 'first performance' as being accurate:

<i>The crowd was nervously awaiting the Double Dutchess debut. They had been corralled outside to see the show. The boom box had a message for the people: Double Dutchess had just broken out of prison, guards were in critical condition, they were traveling in an unmarked white van, and they were armed and dangerous.

As the message was playing, the white van pulled up to release the wrath of Double Dutchess. Chains. Bats. 40's. Tattoos. Orange jumpsuits. The show went off. Tom Epley, who would forever more be a part of every show, played the role of bicycle cop and tried to make an arrest to no avail. Double Dutchess is still at large.</i>

The video on the site is great. They once did double-dutch at a performance dressed as catholic schoolgirls, and during the middle of the jump-roping hijinks, they paused to get down on bended knee and accept communion from a man dressed as a priest (Presumably the aforementioned Epley).

<img src=""http://www.initialvelocity.com/double.jpg"">

I can't do anything but respect that. The satire, the wit. The comedy. Mixing the sexiness with the whole poking-the-world-in-the-eye humor of bringing back something as oldsk00l as double dutch and turning it into a performing art.

Relish in it. It's fucking great. They can be found performing on stage while bands play, or practicing in the street in outfits all over San Francisco.

Double Dutchess is Valtronic, Kate Rock, Little Girl and Switchblade.

If you're in Portland, check them out tonight at disjecta."

"event","Especially my family.

So today I find out that my mother's friend happens to be a close relative of my close cousin's girlfriend. And she just came here from Taiwan not that long ago. Okay, not really all THAT weird, I suppose. I mean, two out of 2 billion Chinese people knowing each other in a foreign country? 


But then that same friend's husband happened to be roommates with my mother's brother (my uncle, of course) in college, and is good friends with him. 

My mother has known this woman for 20 years and neither of them knew about the connection our families had. That amuses me.

I don't know if I've ever gone over other coincidences in my life. Like how my second high school's school colors were color opposites of my first high school. Or how they both had the initials CHS. What about mascot..mas..mascoticular similarities? My second high school? A big grizzly bear. My first high school? A scotsman, which is basically a big bagpipe playing grizzly bear.

Or how some of my friends from my second high school knew people that I knew from my first. Despite the fact that both schools were 45 miles away, with about 100 high schools en route between the two.

Or how about this? My girlfriend in the summer after I graduated had a brother named Mice. I ended up working in the same department as this guy 4 years later at Cisco Systems, 40 miles away, in a corporation of many thousands of people.

Or how once I was producing this radio show for a guy at KSJS and he was supposed to have this famous dominatrix Midori from San Francisco come down and beat/spank/whip/torture/fellate/thrash/homogenize me on the air (I love being a producer, don't you?).. and it turns out that two years later when I went to work at Cisco, I ended up working on the same floor as her fiance. Whom my coworker happened to see on HBO's Real Sex (insert random roman numeral here) with said Dominatrix. 

Then when I went to work for Nortel, the manager of the Database administration team who sat about 30 feet away (keep in mind this is a corporation at the time of 80,000 employees globally) turned out to be the mother of my sister's boyfriend. Also 45 miles away in San Ramon, whereas we were in San Jose.

Yeah, life is full of weird coincidences. I'm surprised that not everybody I know is interconnected some how."

I won't forget his on-screen presence nor his abilities as an actor.

RIP, Brando."

What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.

You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around. 

You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth.

He's nervous, his hand shakes as he takes another drag from his cigarette and he speaks in a low whisper. His words are guarded by a sonic destabilizer from distant, prying ears, and it makes it difficult for me to even make out what he's saying.

""Mark has a briefcase. We want it.""

I'm confused, for a moment, but I don't show it. You can't show it in this kind of business. You have to keep that expression on your face, the one that says you're Mr. Man, you're the one in control. Weakness. Animals can smell fear.

""Alright.""

I don't usually take any keepsakes from my marks. You dust'm, you walk. That's it. My job isn't package retrieval, it's unwanted assisted suicide- unwanted on behalf of the party who's about to lose their life. But the kid pays enough, or whomever gives the kid the money to pay me sure pays enough.

Fuck it.

""Yeah, alright. Got it. Keep the case.""

I walk away from the lone smoking figure and stuff my hands in my pockets. I wonder if she'll be there when I get back. I wonder if I'll get back. I don't like something about this one. The smell, the feel. The taste in my brain. 

Fuck it.

Residents of this shantytown part like the Red Sea did for Moses as I walk on through, just another daily demon doing the devil's work out of a dark place.  Maybe it feels weird because it's the last one. Last one and I'm out. I keep telling myself that, and it never works."

"event","For the past two weeks, I've been sick.

Well, that's a lie. In the immortal words of Monty Python, ""I got bettah""

Then I got sick again. The vile remnants of the martian death flu I received as a lovely birthday gift from He Who Art Upon High (Thanks homeskillet, that shit was great. At least it didn't take my voice away like last time, for which I am grateful) formed some kind of Bacterial Workers Union (BWU local number 381! HOORAH!) and decided to go back to work after being given a pay raise.

They were all promoted from throat work to sinus work, however.

This folks, is why you don't quit smoking when you get sick. This is your body coming back together and repairing itself, and you suffering the Snotty Green Monster disease until it's done. I'd go back to the doctor for antibiotics, but he's just going to shove more of these weird samples at me that make my tongue taste like a shiny new copper penny.

But there's a horrible side effect of me being sick. I've been having fitful sleep at best recently, and far too many dreams. Strange ones. Really strange ones. Ones that feature many friends and I in very strange situations where I am forced to help one or more of them escape some kind of horrible fate like death or working as an internet on the Bush re-election campaign, or even such horrors as <b>*shudder*</b> meeting Oprah.

I wish I could remember the details, however. I feel like I'd find some kind of deep and insightful meaning in the details if I could only remember them."

"event","Sitting at my friend's dance recital, I had a moment of introspection. Not one of your usual moments of introspection that you have while you're on the can and didn't have any reading material to bring in with you, but the kind of profound yet possibly completely unproductive moments of introspection you have when your brain strings together a sequence of relations that you never thought your mind capable of stringing together.

After all, you still couldn't figure out who shot who on that soap opera, right?

So I'm sitting there watching 14 year old girls ballet and after a long sequence of relational thoughts in my head in a brief period of time, I come to a conclusion.

Age makes you lose your optimism, which in turn affects your ability to do new stuff.

<lj-cut text=""Read more bullshit homebrew philosophy or whatever it is."">

See, they say that you learn languages best when you're a little kid. You also learn performance ability best when you're a little kid. Certain things you just have a real hard time learning when you get older, and why?

Self-consciousness and self-doubt.

Sure, you may still have optimism, you may still think world peace is possible and just around the corner. But in the end, the older you get, the more self-consciousness and self-doubt you accrue. Kind of like properties in monopoly, except you don't get any money back when someone lands on your self-doubt neighborhood. You just run and hide with a really red face.

I wonder if there are things I'll never be able to learn. I'm a firm believer that it's possible for anybody to learn anything, so long as they have a normal brain and are given the proper basic training in logical thought and music. Both are very important. 

I want to learn new languages. I want to act in a movie. I want to perform on stage with a band. I want to write something that gets published in a national newspaper. I want to produce and direct a movie. I want to learn how to sing better. I want to learn how to dance. There are plenty of things I want to learn how to do and you know, I think the only ones I'll accomplish are those that don't require overcoming that self-doubt and self-consciousness.

Speaking another language can be hard. You're very self-conscious about how you say what you say becaue you'd prefer not sounding like an idiot. Dancing? You don't want to look like an idiot. Writing? Acting? Same and same. It's not stage-fright. It's self-doubt.

I just want to stay optimistic. I don't want to become some crotchety old man waving an I Love Bush sign on the street corner. I want to stay being -me-, and I want to do and learn the things that I want to do.

Anybody can do anything, given the proper basic training and the ability to overcome self-doubt.

Sigh.

Or Le Sigh as a certain somebody might say.

So, I apologize for this tangent. It's just something I thought of. On a side note, my friend is an incredible dancer. You can really tell she loves what she does and could die happy living it every day of her life. I envy that passion. Her form and style is just.. wowsers. I found myself completely enamored with her ability to dance.

On top of that, I have trips to plan. Chicago on Halloween, Indianapolis in July, Vegas in August and October. And I want to visit NYC in December.

Anyone wanna come with to Chi-town or NYC? :)

"event","So I'm driving back to my apartment in SF last night, which happens to be off market in the Castro. Except I didn't realize that this weekend was what I affectionally term 'The Day They All Came Out' like some kind of bad B-movie title starring people who were once in infomercials and daytime soap operas.

Okay, wait. Before you get the wrong impression, understand that I'm not homophobic or a gay basher. Why? Well..

1- My dad is gay and I have no problem with it. I mean, I had a minor problem with it when I went through the childhood trauma of divorce but even then I supported his decision to live life as who he is instead of a lie.

2- I'm the most open-minded and non-judgemental bastard you'll ever meet. I'm also obviously very humble, so shut the fuck up you stupid chink/spic/dago/wop/kike/nigger/gook/jap/slant-eye/red/ad nauseum/ad infinitum.

So let's play a little math equation.

I am represented in this equation by A. My vehicle is represented by B. Each police roadblock on Market preventing me from getting home is represented by C.

A+B+C^100000 = A^PISSED_THE_FUCK_OFF

Why is it that when a huge group of fags decide to throw a party, they block off ENTIRE ROADS and INCONVENIENCE THE RESIDENTS?

When a huge group of niggers throw a party, they bring RIOT SQUADS and TEAR GAS and tell them to DISPERSE AND STOP BLOCKING TRAFFIC.

Maybe I'm just confused.

I wonder what they do when a bunch of white people get together and throw a huge party.

Well, in a few short minutes after my shower, I get to brave the MUNI downtown through the pride parade mess so I can record some commercials. Fun!"

"event","There are times where the planets align, stars come into conjunction with galaxies far and wide, miracles and voodoo hexes both occur simultaneously and you're left with what the rest of the world refers to as a Bad Day&trade.

Only, your Bad Day&trade feels different than normal bad days. This is a day where you feel riddled with depression and you're not quite certain where it came from. Much like a dozen fresh illegal Mexican immigrants in LA, it arrived overnight without any warning of how. What triggered it? Cosmic forces? Bad breakfast cereal? 

Painful reminders. Ah yes. Those. They're usually the catalyst in the evil biochemical reaction that results in a heavy feeling of depression.

Painful reminders of what? Strangely enough and despite my stunning ability to exist and operate willfully in my somewhat hermitlike existence, the painful reminders of being undesirable. Things people say or do, being just a friend or big brother, all those things leave you with that heavy feeling. And no, I'm not talking about you, you Russian poolshark minx. You had nothing to do with this, honestly. ;)

Don't get me wrong. I have little to no problem finding means to engage in carnal indulgences with fairly attractive members of the opposite sex, and I do so on a frequent enough basis to keep the instinctual animal hidden within sated. Hell, I've even been complimented more than once on my ability to seduce a woman. That's great. But when the ones you really <b>wanted</b> are always going to <b>other people</b> because you are a better friend than anything else (read: not attractive to them in any way), it leaves you with a seed of discontent with yourself. When it happens twice in one day and then another 'friend' calls to tell you about her new boyfriend that's mistreating her, it becomes a full-fledged demonspawn discontent tree. 

With black christmas lights and everything.

So, for now, I will sit and simmer my discontent with some garlic and basil over a medium heat and spend some time with some friends distracting myself from the burning smell in the kitchen until it goes away or the fire department comes by to put out the charred remains of my mind.

Depression happens, folks. It's just the way it is. It's what happens when you attempt to fight social programming and human nature to be a social, loved, and cared-for creature and instead desire to become a fully independent self-willed man with no need or reliance on that external sensory input.

Except for blowjobs, okay? Those are still fucking great."

"event","The blockbuster video at Santa Teresa and Blossom Hill is closing soon, to be replaced by some fine eatery of yuppie proportions that only the extremely middle middle-class can appreciate.

As a result, they've slashed prices on previously viewed DVDs. What does this mean? This means that insipid fools who have no taste in film can purchase used copies of Freddy vs. Jason for a paltry $4.545.

Amidst the pile of steaming fetid crap on the table, I always manage to find the few gems- usually of the Sundance variety.

First find? American Splendor. A movie about a writer of underground comics. I can instantly relate to this one!

Second up: Charlie's Angels- Full Throttle. I know I'll take a lot of flak for that one, but it's not about the plot or the chicks. It's about the <b>way the movie was shot</b>. It's like an hour and a half long music video, much like the first. And it's a style I can appreciate. It's just.. just.. wow.

Third: Amusingly enough, Series 7. I hope that my designation of current Girl [Series 7] has anything to do with this flick, because it's about death. A guy apparently wrote a <b>joke</b> concept about a reality show whereby three people are selected weekly by random lottery, given a gun, and sent out to kill each other. Survivor advances to the next round. He got a reply back from a major network. ""Can we make it more sexy and less violent?"" The fact that they entertained the idea amused him enough to make a movie out of the supposed 'episodes' of the movie.


The third is on the plate for tonight. We'll see about the others later."

"event","Just popping back in to wish everyone and there's, a very Merry Christmas! Happy New Year! A Very Merry Unbirthday! and Happy Hanuka! (Hey, we celebrated both when I was growing up... My Aunt's Jewish)

For those who aren't up on the latest, I'm back in FL (and finally away from NY! YAY!!). Though still several hours away from where I grew up (never really spent time in this area of the state - Cape Canaveral area), and an hour away from most of my friends still in FL (which, with gas prices as bad as they are is troublesome). But it's still nice to be down here, as it seems more like home than NY ever did.

The new job ain't bad - it just ain't good either. Working Securities and Fraud for an e-commerce company which is kinda fun (I just love tracking down assholes trying to steal from people and catching them), but I don't think I'm cutout for call center work. I come home at night, spent - but feeling like I haven't done anything. Ofcourse, working 50 hours a week since before Thanksgiving, and 60+ hours the last two weeks, I do nothing but come home and fall asleep... :p

Also of note, for those who play and are interested, I'm playing (though I haven't had time to in the last two weeks) World of Warcraft on the Burning Blade server (an Orc Warrior named, suprisingly enough, Ayrbourne). Maybe getting into FF Online soon, still don't know."

"event","What's been happening with me?

Let's see... Got a job at Crosman Airrifles! (YAY!)
Got laid off due to cut backs... (BOO!)
Went to Origins! (YAY!)
Came back, still no job, and all the apt applications got turned down... (BOO!)
Got a job at Graver Technologies. (YAY!)
It's still firking hotter than hell, and I'm making fuel filters for Bradley Fighting Vechiles (APC) (Um... Boo?) (Yes, boo...)


So I'm just coasting through til my brother gets up here in Aug, spending time with the family at a get together for his birthday, then hitting the road for Florida. Didn't really want to go to Florida, but at least I'll have some place when I get there, which is more than I can say for most of my other prefered destinations. Largely, not having a job is what's screwing me up the most - I have the money for 6 months rent up front; but everyone wants proof of income :p So for now, I'll head off to FL just to get out of NY, get my sh*t together again, and find somewhere else to be."

"event","I'm cleaning up. Mostly packing away stuff that's been cluttering me for a long while now - stuff I don't need on a regualr basis, but I don't want to get rid of because I do pull it out and make use of it occationally. Besides, I figure this way it'll be packed when I'm ready to move - less work down the line.

Did manage to find a few items I own that I figured I could put up on Ebay - Warhammer 40k stuff I'm not using, some old records which are collectable, even a few old magazines and books I had been collecting (some of which is over 100 years old).

In addition, I found a scrap of paper with a poem I wrote several years ago, which is ironically appropriate now. Figured, with the little positive responce I got on the free-form (little responce, but constitutes a large number of readers of this miserable excuse for writting, in my personal little section of this place), that I'd post this one for people's pleasure (or pain; whatever).

DISALLUSIONMENT

The passage of Time has proved:

that my life is not worthless
merely pointless

that my melancholy has
become nostalgia

that love is still romantic
but that relationship's aren't love

that the burning dreams of youth
are the bitter regrets of age

that suicide is still an option
but it isn't worth the effort

that there is no Meaning to Life
and that cynisim is inevitable

that the world truly is a cesspool
but that Hope can keep a man alive"

Not just sorta sucks, but really, really sucks.

I knew I needed a change, and I had said I need time off from work long enough that I'd get antsy to get back to work, but THIS is not what I had in mind. Knowing, in the back of my mind, that I haven't got a job to go back to after however long, that I haven't got a regular paycheck coming, I can't just sit back and relax and enjoy the time off.

I need to win one of those Win For Life lotto things - but that would take money, and I haven't got enough to spare right now...

this sucks"

"event","So there I was, minding my own business, when BLAM!!! Out of NOWHERE... my boss hands me my pink-slip.

Bah! Petty little man, and petty little reasons, but I was planning on leaving soon anyways - so what do I care? I wanted to leave on good terms - put in a month or more's notice, train my replacement, etc etc - but the new boss desided he needed to make an example of me, so fine. They'd told me more than once I was indispensible, not irreplacable - so let them go and replace me then... They'll find someone to fill my job, but not my shoes.

The real problem, I've figured out is, I had no friends with the upper escelon anymore - everyone I was in good with had been moved or promoted, and the guys left didn't care one whit about me. I guess I chalk it up to Life Leason #359... Apparently when the news was broke I'd been fired, a great roar of disapproval was raised by my peers and subordinates (some, already planning on leaving, put in their resignations then and there - one even walked out, I'm told!) But, they Bosses don't really care - they'll just hire more drones.

Ofcourse, the biggest kick in the teeth is - one of the reason I was fired was for my tendancy to give great customer service!! That's right! It seems it's more important that the people hired and trained to answer questions spend all their time faking out the numbers that Head Quarters sees (so we look good on paper) than answer the questions of our customers. (Yes, the bosses spend a large chunk of their time trying to get around doing processes so their numbers look good without accutually doing the job right the FIRST time...)

Ah, well - it'd gotten to the point I hated going into work anyways. Pretty sad when, You love the company you work for, the people you work with, the job you do, the customers you help - but still dread going into work and seeing your boss' face."

Gotta move. Hate here, gotta move there. Anywhere'd be fine so long as it wasn't here, but wanna be there.
No money to move though - gotta get another job. Hate getting another job. Gotta move, gotta get a job. Life sucks.

New Poem:

Here     there be     dammners
  and
          strommners, for to
follow the blades                  of the roots
      to grass and greens
for many things
of follow and fallow and fellow and friends.

Luck benners        favor the               romp
        til trills of        some summer
soft laughly        and thus.
              Til long           unto 
  ends we do find         our way home.

What's a rainbow when you follow it's long course
But a vision of a dream shared, but a vision ofcourse.
Follow your rainbows, follow your dreams
Fore nothing is never, 'ere ever it seems."

"event","I felt like I&nbsp;was on the verge of a panic attack all day today. I&nbsp;almost started crying several times at work. I felt anxious just checking my e-mail. It was just surreal - because I knew&nbsp; had no good reason to be feeling that way. 

I've been quite depressed lately, tired, lethargic . It is such an ordeal to wake up in the mornings - to get up and actually face things. I&nbsp;just want to stay curled up in my bed or on the couch. On Sunday I&nbsp;slept basically all day. 

But today was something else completely (though I'm sure it's related). I&nbsp;have a history of panic attacks too, but they have always been triggered by something - some actual event.

I was thinking maybe I&nbsp;have seasonal depression. I don't know... I don't know what to think or do. I'm so scared to wake up tomorrow and have another day like today. 

Maybe I will try to eat a bit more tomorrow - and maybe go tanning to get some light.

Then it was toast, tuna, and yogurt. I had planned a salad. So overall I probably ate 500 calories more then I had planned.

"event","This is such a beautiful day. I'm glad since we have quite a long haul home.  It's about a 7 hr drive and my wonderful husband has decided we will leave Ft Bragg as soon as he gets out of school today. I suggested we leave early, early in the morning but nooooo, he wants to leave between 1700 and 1800 today. <sigh> Lord, I wish he'd learn how difficult it is for our son to travel when he is tired.  Oh well.  At least we'll be in our own home for a few days.  It's also looking like we'll make PNO tomorrow night.  I want to make the most of this trip cause I'm not sure when we'll get to come back.
      It's looking like I'm gonna miss Chattacon. :(  Normally, I won't mind very much but I was *really* hoping to get Micheal Gear's autograph.  Oh well. Maybe someday. 
      Oops, my little guy will be home in a few minutes so I'm off to make snacks.   Hope to see lots of ya'll tomorrow night."

"event","As I sit here in my house (notice I did not say new home) waiting for my son to get home from school, I pause to contemplate the coming year..and to wonder over the last.  I know that 2005 was a rather difficult year for so many of my friends and family.  It was certainly a challenge for me.  I was sick most of the spring and summer of 2005.  I came damn near to having pneumonia twice, broke a toe, became severely anemic..etc.  The most difficult thing was losing my dear Sister Elf.  I can not say the number of times I've picked up the phone to call her just realize I can not.  I miss you so much Sister.
     Lest you all think 2005 was a complete wash-out, I do have to admit that in many ways it was a very good year.  My family and I were able to open our home to friends and family on several occassions. I will never forget the site of my friend, C, as he morphed from a dignified adult businessman into a silly 12 yr old.  My family has grown stronger and we have never been more unified. My health is improving. My son started school and to my delight, he LOVES it. I've rediscovered my personal Path. So, all-in-all, I supposed 2005 was worth living. <g>
     Now, with the new year comes new adventures.  We've moved from our beloved home in east TN to an Army post in NC.  The house here is tiny and we know no one.  However, we are together.  That counts for a lot.  My son has already started his new school and likes his teacher as well as the other kids in his class. My husband has started school also and is knee deep in learning new things that will aide him in his career. I haven't gotten a job yet, but I have found I am enjoying the extra time.  I'm deep into researching Huna magic as well as indulgling in a few other interests.
      As this New Year begins, I'd like to take this time to wish all my Loved Ones a Wonder-filled, Love-filled, Curiosity-filled Year.
Blessings."

"event","I opened this account a while back. Made one post and then nothing.  Recently my friend, B., asked why I didn't use it and I told him I didn't know what to write.  He laughed and told me to write what I know.  So, here goes. Be advised I tend to ramble.
     Not too long ago, I got the opportunity to spend time with some of my favorite children.  I normally do not get into a pool with masses of people becaue I do not swim well.  However, one of the other adults promised he wouldn't let the kids drown me. I grabbed a floaty and join him on the ""adult"" end of the pool.  As we watched the kids laughing and playing, we began to tal about reason evironmental events and the seeming increase in violent crimes. R. said he thought that those of us close to the Mother maybe felt it more strongly than others.  I told him that I'd also noticed that lots of my friends and relations were becoming more appreciative of what they have in their lives.  This let me to spend some time contemplating my riches, or blessings if you will.
     So, here is my current list.  I am rich in the Love I receive and give. I am honored to call S. my husband and have such a wondered, loving, intelligent, magickal little boy as a son.  I have friends I can call on any time, any where for any thing.  I am amazed at the number of people I can *honestly* call Friend.  I have my health for the most part. Okay, I'm severely anemic but that means I get to eat more red meat! So, it's all good.
I have a home that is both comfortable and appealing.  I am able to indulge in some of my favorite activities *and* I don't feel guilty about it!
     Okay. So it's not very exciting but it *is* what I have on my mind these days.  At least for the most part.  Hope everyone has a lovely day.
Happy Lammas!"

"event","Good morning all,
       After much badgering from a dear friend, I've decided to enter the 21st century with just a bit of kicking and screaming.  I'm not sure how often I'll be able to post, or that it will be fun and educational, I just say I'm here. For now, I'm off to play in the dirt.  Have a wonderful day!

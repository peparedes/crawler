"event","went and saw willie wonka tonight, it was absolutely amazing i thought. depp did such a amazing job i can't see how anybody could walk out of that movie and not be amazed by his performance, some of the kids on the other hand weren't that great. but all in all i was definitely glad to pay the money to see that one. other then that i've decided to start a new workout regimen so i went and go the weight set ive had my eye on for awhile, kinda let that stuff get away from me this summer which i shouldnt have done, im hoping to bench 300 by the end of the year which prob isnt a huge leap cause i did 250 at the end of last year and i have weight training double blocked this year so thats good. anyways other then that not much goin on.

cant wait to see you all at school

much love, catch ya on the flip

Hannah I've admired you since the first moment I saw you in choir. You were just so breathtakingly beautiful that it amazed me beyond belief. I would sit there most days just singing and taking the occasional glance your way hoping to catch your eye. Slowly I began to speak of you to my dearest friends and low and behold one of them knows you really well. Not to long after that my hopes came true. We began to have convo's even if they were just on msn I loved them.  Everytime I would see you pop online a smile would just creep across my face. Then we actually began to talk about hanging out and it hasn't happened but the times it has happened have been some of the most magical moments of my life so far. The other night when you put me on the spot and had me to admit I liked you I was so scared that you may not feel the same way but now it's kinda up in the air and I still don't know. But today when we talked we just seemed to ignore that convo completely. Well I got this off my chest and hope my friends post about it lol and if it ever finds its way to you which it may *cough* bre *Cough* i hope you kind of understand me a bit better after reading it"

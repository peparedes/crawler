"event","I skipped the whole school day again. I just couldn't find the resolve to put myself through the effort to drive, struggle for a parking space, be uninterested in class, and go home to work later that night. I was just as bored at home as I would have been at campus. I have all these things I could do, projects I could conduct, and etc. I just can't find the motive to do ANYTHING. This kind of lethargy's going to bite me in the end. After all, it already has in my grades. A nice, juicy 2.3 GPA. I just can't get myself to care anymore. There's no reason for the lazy behavior. I don't have anything particularly fun that would tempt me to ignore my studies. I just don't care anymore. The things I 'wanted' to do after college, working for the government, programming and stuff... I can't determine whether I really WANT to do those things, or simply because that's all I really CAN do well enough to justify a job for. What kind of person is one that lacks the drive to do anything at all? It's like I'm not really living anymore."

Dear FOX news,

You're reaching a little far up your ass to believe that Revenge of the Sith (Or ""Seeth,"" as one of your out-of-touch-with-reality reporters has pronounced it) has an Anti-Bush message. Sure, the 'you are with us, or you are against us' phrase has parallels between the two. That's what we call a cliche. That sort of thing predated BOTH of those events. Sorry FOX, your attempt at smearing everything that leaves Hollywood as liberal (or for that matter, aligned with ANY party) makes me ill from the stupidity of the concept."

I just feel it in the back of my mind that I don't know what I want in the long run. Not even the vague general things such as whether it involves college or not. It's not so simple as not going anymore. Another feeling is the unease of not knowing how I'd feel about it later, as if it would shame me to stop. There's just no defined will to try at all, no want for anything. It's pretty likely that I'll barely graduate and in the end it means jack shit other than a complete waste of time and money. The impulses within didn't go away either. I still get morbid plans of suicide running though my head, as if some part of me is developing the ultimate contingency based upon cold percentages of guaranteed death to the point of envisioning the experience in my mind's eye. I take my goddamn meds and they DON'T LEAVE. I've never hurt anyone or willed to ruin anybody. I avoid killing even bugs when I can just leave them outside. I was told I was smart and could be somebody someday. Everything extrapersonally is FREAKING FINE. I just can't summon up the will to want anything farther down the road than the next paycheck, not even to define whether I want to live through it all or not."

Erika,

U probably already know that im leaving, i knew this would be better if i wrote a letter explaining tha truth about how much i care about you. The truth is, is that i never loved you, i hated you so much, u are my bitch and dont u ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, n be around u. U really have no clue how much i hate you. Now that im leaving i thought u should know that i hate you bitch, u never did tha right thing, and u were never there. I didnt think i could hate someone as much as i hate you. And i never want to see you, for the rest of my life, i will never miss kissing you like before, i never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and thats a promise. U never had my love, and i want you to remember that. Bitch u keep this letter bcuz this may be tha last thing u have from me. I hate you so much. i will not talk to you soon bitch.... Goodbye

Girl: ummm ok

[She finds a piece of paper in tha jacket, It says...]

Baby i hope u find this before u read my letter. I knew ur dad might read it, so i switched a few words...

Hate = Love

Never = Alwayz

Bitch = Baby

Will not= will

Got a sick flow - didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates

Why did I ever let you inside my heart? I'm such a fool.
Paint my face in shades of blood and grey 
and take the seat right next to me
But I should've known that you were a killer. But now I'm dead.

A gaping hole, shot through my heart
A lost connection from your poison dart
Shot from your tongue to end my life.
But if you're blowing at the fire to light your strife.

You'll never know. You'll never know.
The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.

A gaping hole... (shot through my heart)
A lost connection from your poison dart.
My head now spins and my ears bleed gold.
I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.

The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day. [x2]

You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay
I'll stab you one time.
I'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain.
Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams?
I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you. Now I'm insane. [x3]"

"event","Once upon a time there were three little pigs
who went out into the big world
to build thier homes and seek thier fortunes.

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy boaster
The sherrif at the border ,he tried to take me out
I drew my axe with the quickness-and cut his adam's apple out!
Walked in the village and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door and shot me in the face
And blew me off the porch-and blew my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo so it only made me laugh (ha ha!)
Axe in hand, I rose like the dead
And swung with all my might- made a thump noise in his head
Since we out west, I grabbed a shotgun
And blew his fuckin tounge out the back of his cranium!!

[CHORUS:]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like a sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The Carnival's in town- come and get your piggy snacks

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a mother fuckin dick
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a volkswagon bug 17 deep
Packed fulla Juggalos, lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out- we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in persuit like Starski and Hutch
But theres only two of them-the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkon Doughnuts to gather up the rest
25 piggies with they bullet-proof vests
We lead them in a chase,they bustin off rounds
But now they all fucked cuz we at the Carney grounds
And they gettin swallowed by their very on breed
DARK CARNIVAL and wicked clowns because we need....

[CHORUS 2x]

The last little piggy, his house is made of gold
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it- the gaurd he told me wait
I snapped his fuckin neck in two and slammed his nuts in the gate
Cuz this little piggy must defianatly die!
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil
And pull it out the sky and beat it with a shovel
People in my city, they fightin for they meals
He sleeps on a matress stuffed with hundered dollar bills
A richey is the devil- he never will admit it
So I'm 'a cut his hand off and slap his face wit' it
Opened up his door, he sleeping in his bed
I grabbed a brick of gold and slapped it upside his head
He begged for his life, I told him its too late
And tied his neck in a knot and watch him suffocate"

No matter how much i hate you, you never deserved that. I was talking about another incident but w/e i am not allowed to say my side to this you just have to attempt to take a cheap shot at me. Well sorry that you missed me and hitting me would not solve the problem it would just make it worse because i have alot of girls that can back me up, so if you are going to have people come after me i will have twice the amount  of people after you 2 so don't fuck with me, oh yes sam thats not a threat, its a promise, and just don't take it the wrong way again since you 2 are much less intelligent than your average blondes. I will have girls on your shit, if you think about having people coming after me, even though you might have half of carmel against me, i have people from white plains, the bronx, wingdale, brewster, patterson, and of course the carmel area, so i recommend you just leave things be."

Where you are and how you feel.

I don't know why but i still have a bit of respect for you. Of course i fucked things up again wit tara because wrote untrue statements about her and her bf but w/e i don't remember it i am getting blamed for it and i have no choice but to admit that its my fault and i can't fix things this time and i really can't try at this point. I am sorry sean i am sorry tara and to you frank. w/e i just know that you people will never understand nor try to. You people are just kids, you will never know the way i have had it. I have been through so much shit that you can possibly imagine. How the fuck do i expect you kids to even know how fucked my life is? All of you people live with your actual parents and didn't have a fucked up childhood, screw it if you people are curious of how i feel then IM me, other than that ""fuck you"" you can't possibly imagine how hard it was for me, and no i am not looking for sympathy so fuck you if you think that, I just hate that ""certain people"" think i am trying to win over a crowd, i am just trying to find someone who can listen and that can help me, because i can't take this shit anymore, and the secrets that are stored in me. 

P.S.  I repeat yet again i am sorry that friendship couldn't work out and i am not going to bother to ask for forgiveness because i know for a fact that i will not get it, so the hell with it this will probably be the last journal entry i will write relating to you, peace."

(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"

I am not going to be cooped up in this fucking house like i am some little ass kid. I have had it with people for all i care, everyone can go drop dead. There is a few people that care about me and a good amount of people that pretend to care, everyone else are fucking bioist. Hmm Od'ing on pills at this moment would be nice, hell even slitting my wrists, or drinking to the point that i die of alcohol posioning, don't think its possible? ask one of my good friends brian kelley, oh thats rite, he is dead now, and i never got to thank him for being a good friend to me, i am going to miss him he was one of my friends ever since i visit this fucking town when i was 8, god bless him. mark you are a good friend and my number 1 homie and bri you are my number 1 female homie, same thing to you mel, i love you as a friend and i am happy that you are always there for me 2, tara thank you for being friends with me, u 2 sean. everyone else could have a care in the world so fuck you all and if i sound funny writing this shit, is because i am not sure what i plan on doing to myself before this nite is through i have no fucking clue if i plan on ending it rite here, rite now and if i don't it will only be for one reason.....   other than that, the people i mentioned, i love you all and i hope i see you again in the future, well peace out, need to drink some more shit with these pills....."

"event","Its really hard these days to know who are my friends anymore. I mean i get my ass kicked by spif last fucking week. I would have fought back, but since i am on probabtion i really couldn't do shit about it. Ashalieha if you ever read this. I didn't exactly rat you out, hell i had no choice but to tell at least the truth to the cop that day because i was already in court for DWI and since i am on probabtion, if i didn't play ball with him i was going to get arrested for breaking and entering and accessory for theft. I am sorry i mean it from the bottom of my heart, i did not want to do that, if i wasn't on probabtion and didn't have that DWI charge, i would have not only not rat you out, i would have been your alibi that you were chillin with me for the past couple of weeks, fuck it what happened, happened and there is nothing i can do to undo things. I hate this fucking town, i am sick of it because now basically i am living in this town alone with no one to turn to, i only have a couple of friends left if any, other than that i have nothing to live for anymore."

"event","I might as well be the fuck honest of why i plan on leaving this fucking town and state in september. I got the opportunity of a lifetime to get the hell out of this town and state to live in georgia with a good friend of mine. I am leaving this town once and for all because i am a laughing stock to all the people in this town, my supposed ""friends"" think i am a joke. i get no respect whatsoever in this town, i get shot down everytime i ask someone out and its getting really fucking tiring, i swear to god if i live here any longer i will slit my fucking arm so deep that it will be too late for anyone to save me, and personally if i cut my arm bleeding and knowing that i am dying i will laugh. Most Friends i have in this town use me, play me, and fuck me over. I am sick of being overlooked, i have been retreated into a corner and my only escape out of it is moving once and for all and never look back."

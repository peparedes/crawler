"event","I feel a real stinging urgency in my life. It hasn't been that long since I had an easy to follow plan and direct path laid out before me, but already it feels like I'm slipping to the side, slowing down, losing track of my goal, and getting so turned around I might be going the wrong way, all at once. There's decisions to be made ,now, that I feel I mistakenly made months or even years ago without realizing it. I've shut doors that I didn't know even existed and now I want open. Only they're never going to open. They are sealed shut with a sign that says sorry, you are not the person we hoped you'd be. How depressing. I feel like a world class orchestra performer who's lost in the masses because he's not playing the right songs and drowned out by outlandishly average players he has surrounded himself with. I feel skill, talent, intelligence, courage, creativity, personality, and many other good things pulsing through my body and in every corner of every bone I have. Yet, I've shown it to only a handful of people none of whom can do anything with it, just as I seemingly can't. It's a lonely world out there and one I fully expected to have on my mantle as one of many accomplishments but as time fades I've been brought back down to it as quickly as one in a free fall can expect. I know it's not over, of course not. But it's obvious there are only three types of people in this world: Those who figure it out, those who never figure it out, and those figure it out, only it's too late. Let's hope this writer has the former in store."

"event","I'm back everyone, I've decided that I should continue to use LJ. I miss posting on here and so I might as well do it again. My life lately is a lot different now then it used to be. I'm about to finish college with a B.A. in Economics. I'm also starting the flight program which means in about 2 1/2 years I'll be a certified commercial pilot. From there I'll just have to find ways to accumulate hours in order to get enough to get hired by a big airline. I want to be a commercial pilot for Alaska Airlines or something similar. Anyway, back to less serious things. I was lookin over some of my old posts and it's so weird to go back and look at who I was talking to and what I was up to 3 years ago, I can't decide if all the lyrics I used to post were any good or just crap, haha i was thinking that time would tell but apparently it hasn't. Anyway, I want to become a little more involved in this site again so if you're one of my old friends on here and you happen to accidentally stumble across my journal again, hi!"

"event","hey everybody i know i haven't posted in a while but i decided to write about something that i realized is kind of funny to me. i started thinking about just how weird it is that everyone in the world has this one life to live, and yet everyone is so okay with doing weird things in their life. ok i know this sounds kind of weird but seriously...people are living this one life, everyone you know. and they're all decideding to do things with it, and yet even though everybody believes this is their one and only life on all of planet earth, they're just so okay with doing things like being an actor for a career. i was watching some random movie and this guys mom had a heartattack in it. and he was acting like he was so worried for his mom's life. and it first it seemed really good acting..then i thought in all of their choices of things to do with their life..they decide to pretend to be other people doing random things in their made up lives. i mean seriously think about how stupid that is. i mean think about how god must think about an actor? with all the options of things to do...you 're just choosing to mimic other peoples lives. how pointless is that?"

You're just right around there. You're cool. I'd probably prefer to
hang out with someone like you with this IQ. You're a little above
average, but not quite a genius so that you annoy me with useless crap.

"event","I finally found megan kuhl again ahhh i love that girl so much. she finally called me she's always been a hard one to track down, but getting to talk to her just made me remember why i even cared that much to find her. she's just great. anyway. even though i never update instead of catching you guys up i'm just gonna skip right ahead to the present. I'm living in ellensburg right now currently in my parents house, i just moved back in last week finals were done last friday. i'm planning on moving into either ryegate or ashton court cause its only 270 a month there. not bad at all. okay as for the current interests...i've been spending a lot of time with this girl named lauren and i guess like any girl she's not an easy one to figure out. she's always calling wanting to hang out but yet she's got some ex boyfriend that she mentions a little too much for my liking. we'll see how that goes. also i've been talking to kaycee hagan a lot she's a little young for me, just graduated, but she's really fun to talk to and gorgeous so...who knows. thats all for now i'm tired. 

oh i got a couple new pics check em out"

"event","i haven't been drinking lately but that changed on thursday night. i started off the night trying to finish this paper on bill clinton but my roommates started drinking and pretty soon a few people were over and i started drinking and next thing i know i'm kinda drunk and i couldn't really finish my paper haha. but amanda came over i met her a month or so ago but she goes to boise state so i hadn't seen her since then but  she was back for the weekend and she's transferring here for winter quarter and i dunno we kinda hit it off so we'll see how that goes. we went over to pats at about 12 and honestly it was the most fun party i've been to here. it really was cool, the whole baseball team was there pretty much, a lot of girls were there...none of them were chewing..it was just great! haha. no really if i haven't mentioned it before i've seen some girls chewing at parties here and it just makes me sick. haha. so anyway we had a good time and ended up gettin to bed about 4:30 or so. last night again i tried to work on my paper haha however this time i got it done before i got drunk. such a good student i am. we really dont drink very much here but for some reason everyone was just throwin down thursday and friday. last night started off pretty much the same way i talked to amanda for a while and eventually her and cynthia came over and we played drinking games for a while until we decided to go over to the aviation house at like 12. it was cool over there a lot of people but like always when aviation guys and baseball guys get together a fight breaks out haha i have no idea why..right as i was leaving like 20 guys started fighting with about 6 or 7 baseball players i had no idea what was going on cause apparently it happend like 2 seconds after we left. this morning we had to be at the school at 8 for a baseball meeting. i think i was still drunk. i dont feel good i think i'm gonna go to sleep or something, wow that an idea."

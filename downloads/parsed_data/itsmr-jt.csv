"event","well this past week was amazing, my beautiful girlfriend was home for 5 days. we had so much fun together and i couldnt ask for a better thanksgiving break. 
erica and i went and cut down our own tree which was ummmmmm alot of fun, come to think of it, it was so cold outside and i had on no gloves so i had to wear ericas and i kinda ruined them really bad, i didnt know cutting down a tree would be so exhausting. can you just picture it, me laying flat on the floor in the snow and dirt freezing trying to cut down this tree which serious took like a half hour to cut down and erica just laughing cuz i was out of breathe lol, on top of that erica and i had to drag the damn tree almost literally a freakin mile it seemed like, we walked so far out there. even though i was freezing i would do it all over again, i would do anything for my baby.
   The best moment i recall spending with erica had to be when it was snowing pretty good outside about maybe nine o'clock, we actually went for a walk around her sub, the atmosphere and the moment couldnt feel any better than how i felt being right there with her, it was amazing!
   i know alot of people have someone they love and have or had a special moment with. what was a special moment you had with the one you love that will forever stay with you!!!?????????? comment!"

"event","high school is over now and everyone is on their way, on their way to become whatever it is their heart desires for them to be. well!! that means there needs to be a time for change, to change the way you look at things, a different perspective, not from a highschoolers perspective, but from a growing adults perspective. what i guess im trying to say is, people ""grow up"" there are far more things you need to worry about than who is gonne be your friend tommorrow. friends will come and friends will go, you will meet new ones and lose old ones, and the ones that remain friends with you are the real ones. i think we all need to worry about what we are gonne become in life and leave the high school life behind us all, the things like, are we gonna be able to support a family one day, am i gonna make myself and my family proud of what i have accomplished, we need to look at the upside here, it really is time to grow up, think like an adult now, make adult decisions, and do something about it. dont just sit around playing video games all day, and cry like a baby over why someone didnt put you on their friends list lol! thats not what is important, i could care less about what someone thinks of me, i have to be me right now and do what i have to do to make it in the real world, caring about what other people think of me is not important to me, dont get me wrong i love hanging out and having fun, but there is always and time and place for that, but there is business to take care of first....."

"event","well yesterday was such a wonderful day!! to start it off ericas parents and my parents had dinner together for the first time ever, erica and I just thought it would be a good idea for our parents just to come together and have dinner and get to know one another better, it really went well!, better than i had exspected, at first there was some awkward silence after we just sat down but then we all started to interact and everything became wonderful, i just thought it was really nice to see our families talking and laughing together about memories from the past and other oldie stories from the marines and the navy lol! what was funny about having our parents meet for dinner was that they all thought of the same thing, which was "" i hope this is strictly dinner and your not gonna tell me ericas pregnant or you guys are getting married"" lol! thats so funny erica and I didnt even think of that! but all in all it went well!!! good times.

later that night erica and I met up with lyndsay and chad, i missed hanging out with them its been quite a while since we all became the foursome again lol! we went to a haunted hayride which wasnt all that great but i still had a really great time just being there with my girlfriend and lyndz and chad. i think we are going to hang out with them again today to go see ""saw 2"" which is gonna be a sweet ass movie.  well.....i hope everyone is having a good halloween weekend, be careful take care and dont do anything stupid lol!!"

"event","there comes a time in everyones life where they are gonna have what you describe as ""hard times"". everyone goes through it. so when it happens to you, do not get discouraged and feel unloved or like the world is falling right on top of you, never feel unloved because no matter who it is, someone loves you. just keep on pushing forward and never give up, keep your head up and never look down. you have to remember its gonna come to a end at some point, always keep God a part of your life, he is always willing to lend a helping hand. dont ask why this is happening to you, think of it as a preporation for what lies ahead for you in your life. have you ever heard of everything happens for a reason? well i believe thats true, and ive learned that from exsperience, i had my hard times, it may not be the last, but it was for the better, and i have the one person i love, and im happier than ever. it took some time, but nothing is just handed to you. no matter what you describe as your ""hard times"" remember its only gonna get better, its for the best, just let go and let God. just take it one day at a time, one foot in front of the other, and let life work its self out. i love all you guys and im glad i met a wonderful group of people such as you guys, u know if you ever need anything im always willing to help!"

"event","whatever situation, whatever circumstances, every trial and tribulation, every fall,a wrong move you make, their is always someone there to pick you up. the question i have for you is, who is that person, is it the person you think its gonna be. 

never let the world bring you down and the people living in it, there is one person that thinks of you as the world, that will lift your head up high.

......love your neighbor as you love yourself.....

what is your meaning of love.......

my meaning of love is giving absolute 100% of yourself to that person, nothing less, doing whatever it takes to make the other feel loved, always being available through the good and bad times. remember love is not just a word, it has meaning, dont ever tell someone you love them just to here it in return, say i love you because thats exactly how you feel.

i began to think one day about how all of us were happy and all together at one time, i was over kanes house and kirk put on the springbreak video, i hated watching it becuase it makes me just wanna jump right into the tv and be there again. i know we can never ever go back to that again and it can never be perfect as we all explain it. but we can make other things good. we all may not be together at one time anytime soon, but just knowing we had good moments together and meeting new friends should be good enough. just like gilbert and kirk said, forget about last spring break, its time for a new one. im so glad to have met all of you guys and gals, you all are great people!!! thankyou for the wonderful memories i now have to remember for the rest of my life.!!!"

misses ""joey wear your seat belt"", "" put your seat belt on joe""lol!!!!!!!!!
is not wearing her seat belt for the first time in her life time lol!!

"event","good morning everyone!!!





well yesterday had to be the best day i have ever had, i got to hang out with beautiful erica.
we planned on eating sushi for dinner, which i personally thought would be the most grosses thing ill ever eat, but to my surprise it was actually good, i actually ate like 5 of them and erica ate 3.
u know it just felt so good being there with her, just her and i, laughing and just having a good time together at dinner, it couldnt have started off better.
later on in the day we went to the mall with her roommate betsy and her friend which i dont remember her name. once we got there they went their seperate way and we went ours, so once again it was nice just to be with erica.
and of course we cant go to the mall without buying something lol! so beautiful erica had to buy some workout shoes (""they have to be newbalance""erica'lol!!!) after that she was looking for t-shirts to workout in too, so after ripping all the t-shirt packages at marshall fields and jc penny, we ended up not finding any for her and leaving them there ripped open. lol!! 
u know its just so amazing how one person can make your world go round, just being there with her yesterday was just so amazing, i never had so much fun. well all in all it was a good day, i so cant wait to see her again, miss her allready.                 oh yea!, the emily rose movie was pretty good, but your right kane, to many court scenes, it needed more gore lol!"

have you ever been so in love you would do absolutely anything just to see that person smile. to make that person feel how much love you have for them. to make sure they stay the princess that they are. well!, make sure you stay that way cuz it means alot, even though they may not react to it like you would hope for, im sure it makes them feel good knowing they have someone who cares for them so much. and know they will always be there for them no matter what. thats the way i feel about erica!!! i love you sweety. never let that person, that means so much go. they are truly a gift. always know that."

"event","well the last couple days have been crazy, i took my mcoles test which totally drained me out, but i did pass which is a good thing, im so much closer to acheiving one of my goals. to start my life and be on my own. im the kinda person that wants to make everyone proud, to say, you know joe is succeeding and putting effort into becoming a police officer.
i wanna show the people that need to be showen, im gonna make it!, im gonna be something!, and im gonna be a able to support a family one day to the best of my ability because i have alot to look forward too in life.
im ready for the adult life, im not trying to grow up too fast, its just time to become an even better man. time, life, love, is too short to just let it pass away. now is the time for me to grow up, get my life organized, then the fun will come later.
i dont just do things just for others, i do, do these things for myself as well. but my family and erica are a big part of why this drive to succeed is so strong. im gonna make them proud. i promise!."

This journal is a nice escape type thingy I kinda like it.

Currently I am attempting to get a hold of some people to study. Ah time set, lovely.

Life is happy right now and I am content. Large change from before thank god, can't believe how retarded I was. Kill myself"

Yes well hello and welcome to this journal, I'll be surprised if anyone is reading this...

I still have not decided if I want to make this friends only or not...we'll see how it goes

Today I had it pretty rough, I just broke down utterly. It was a pathetic site I'm sure.

God I think I'm becoming jaded, I used to be so much perky..er. Ah well people change, or perhaps this is only a phase. Only time will tell, but for now when I'm here on this account: Jaded it is mates.

god this layout is ugly and boring...I should put a pic in the bg or something...god there are a million things I should be doing but instead I'm sitting here brooding and messing with my lj....

I just have no drive for anything anymore"

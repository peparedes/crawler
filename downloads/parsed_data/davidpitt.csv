LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) 
the Scales of Justice. Cardinal, air, yang - planetary ruler: Venus. Keywords: ""I BALANCE""
Libras sorted into House Hufflepuff are some of the sweetest, most charming individuals you will ever meet. They work hard at their studies compared to other Libras (most Libras would rather coast on their strengths than apply themselves to all their subjects) and are often quite successful. <strike>Physically, however, they remain unathletic and lazy - the closest they'll ever get to a Quidditch match is the spectator's box, and that only if the weather is pleasant.</strike> Anything beautiful and harmonious appeals to the Hufflepuff Libra. Since potions and alchemy require an instinctive awareness of the harmony of ingredients, Hufflepuffs who are Libras display a surprising facility in these subjects. These wizards live to help other people, and to help their friends get along with each other; nothing hurts them more than to see people in distress or bickering with each other. Feuds and wars between wizards distress them. Equally distressing is the disharmony between Muggles and magic users. Many Hufflepuff Libras become Muggle specialists, hoping to bridge the gap between magical and non-magical. 

<b>Bloodline:</b> Pureblood
<b>Heritage:</b> British 

<b>Mother:</b> Tamora Pitt, 38, doesn't work, recently divorced
<b>Father:</b> Richard Pitt, 42, Department of Mysteries, recently divorced then remarried
During his mid-twenties, Richard and some friends stopped at a Muggle pub for Merlin knows what  reason. (It had seemed like a good idea at the time.) He met and began an affair with one of the  waitresses there, which resulted in his first son, Jeremy. Richard was ashamed at having been with a  Muggle and he didn't want the world at large to know, so he manipulated her into giving up the  child. Mari was a college student with little to no money and he found it easy to charm her into  believing he would give Jeremy a far better home than she could, using the wizarding world to hide  from her once he'd gotten his way.

Sometime after all of this, he met and married his first wife, though it was a marriage of  convenience for their families and not one of love. He's only ever touched his wife to produce their  two children or when they've been drunk.

Nevertheless, everything went according to plan - Jeremy wanted for nothing and no one knew his true  parentage - until Richard ran into Mari at at King's Cross as they were both picking up their  children from the Hogwarts Express. After a heated exchange that resulted in him being slapped, they  spoke a bit more civilly and Richard realized that not only had he been wrong to keep her from their  son, but that he still had feelings for her after all these years. Since then, he began to actively  pursue a rekindling of their prior relationship, even though they were both married.

When Mari's husband died, Richard all but moved in to be there for her and her children -until she  forced him to leave a couple of weeks after most of her brood had gone back to Hogwarts. He went  back home, but promptly asked his wife for a divorce (in which she got custody of their two boys),  realizing that now that he has Mari in his life again, a loveless marriage just isn't enough for him  anymore.

Less than a year later, he and Mari were married and Richard has never been happier. 

<b>Guardian:</b> N/A
<b>Siblings:</b> Jeremy Pitt, 18, 7th year Slytherin / Garrett Pitt, 14, 4th year Slytherin

<b>Personal History:</b> 
David has lived a fairly normal life. Well, he considers it normal. He had a mother, a father and brothers. He loved his brothers and, for the most part, they loved him. His parents didn't have the  most conventional marriage (you're supposed to marry for love, after all) but he never questioned  whether his parents cared for him or his brothers. It was obvious, of course that they did not love  one another but that particular fact never seemed to be an issue in their lives. 

Another, obvious, well known fact was that Jeremy, the oldest of the Pitt boys, had a different  mother than the two younger ones. Of course, it was unclear as to who this mother was but those  facts were largely unimportant to David. 

Though the selfish gene seemed to run rampant among the Pitt men, he was happy with his family as  long as the individual members were happy. Which, most of the time, everyone was just that... happy.

Once of age, Hogwarts was a given. However, the entire family was shocked when they found out that  he had been sorted into Hufflepuff. The Sorting Hat had a hard time placing him... though, that was  mostly attributed to the fact that he argued with the piece of material on his head when it informed  him that he was Hufflepuff to his very core. Every Pitt man (there seems to be very few girls in the  line) for as long as anyone could remember had been sorted into Slytherin and David, really, didn't  want to let his family down. (Much less take the constant teasing from his brothers for being one of  those Prat Puffs.)

Though he'd fought hard against it, he felt at home with the Badgers and found his place among  friends and classmates. Unlike his father and older brother, he was focused on his school work. He  wanted to do well and he didn't have time for things such as girls. Which, sadly, also seemed to set  him apart from every other male in the Pitt line. 

It is possible that he's the only one to ever exist but David Pitt is a virgin among ladies men and  he likes it that way. He'd never admit to it but he views his virginity as something special. He's  in no rush to fall in love and in even less of a rush to fall into lust. He believes that there is a  girl out there for him. He also believes that their meeting will be some will of fate and he wants  to be perfect for her when that happens.

Unlike his younger brother, Garrett, David took his parents separation well. He didn't blame the  muggle woman that his father later married, nor did he blame Jeremy. (Since, apparently, this muggle  was the boy's mother.) Again, he was happy as long as his father was happy and, honestly, he was  glad that the man had finally found true love. The thought of a loveless marriage had always  saddened him and though it wasn't the best news to go out among their pureblood elitist circle of  family friends, he was accepting.

Mostly, his life remains unchanged at school. He works hard at his studies and has fun with his  friends. Though that can be credited to the fact that David does not hang with the Pureblood crowd  at school. There are far more important things to worry about, in his opinion, and too much time around the pureblood elitist ignorance would only push him over the edge.

<b>Personality:</b>
David's quiet demeanor might lead people to believe he is shy, but that's not the case. David is perfectly outgoing when he wants to be, but he tends to spend a lot more time focusing on his studies than trying to make friends or impress girls.

He spends a good amount of his spare time in the library and works hard for his good marks, especially this year since he is due to take OWLs at the end of term. Unlike Jeremy, David isn't content to just coast by on his trust fund. He wants to do something with his life and he believes in working hard for the things you want.

This isn't to say David is <i>completely</i> anti-social. He has friends and he does enjoy spending time with them. He just sees school as a much higher priority than most other things, so while he's at school, most of his energy is focused on studying.

It's not really a surprise that David is a complete romantic. He's the complete opposite from Jeremy when it comes to girls. Not only has he not had nearly the experience Jeremy has, but he doesn't want to have those experiences. Instead, he wants to save himself for the right girl. He's not actively looking for her <i>right now</i>, because school is his priority, but he knows he wants to one day find a nice girl to settle down with and have a family with.

True to his house, David is loyal, especially to his family. He's closer to Jeremy than he is to Garrett, but he loves both of his brothers and he would do almost anything for them.

He's pretty easy going and he has the patience of a saint. It's really difficult to piss the boy off and even when you do, he's not likely to get violent. In friendships and relationships, he tends to be pretty passive, preferring to give in to what the other person wants rather than get in an argument.

<b>Physical Description:</b> 
About 5'9"" tall and weighing about 165 lbs, he's about average height and build for his age. He dressed pretty casually most of the time, though he always appears to be well groomed. David has a tendency to chew his (non-existent, cause.. chewing) fingernails when he's concentrating. It's a bit of an oral fixation that mostly presents itself when he's nervous or thinking really hard about something.

<b>Preferred Body Model:</b> Chris Marquette
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v88/cece_icons/Picture1-3.png""></center>

<b>Hobbies and talents:</b>
David doesn't really have any hobbies or talents. 
Though he enjoys quidditch, he doesn't play all that often, nor is he really amazingly good at it when he does.
He is really focused on his studies and spends a lot of his time studying but reading is not something he particularly enjoys or does for fun.

<b>Weaknesses:</b>
quiet - David's quiet nature gives the impression that he's shy and can sometimes make him seem a bit unapproachable.
insecurities - living in the shadow of an older brother like Jeremy (who seems to be good at <i>everything</i>) isn't easy, especially when David has doesn't see himself as anything special

overthinking/overanalyzing - the boy really does think too much

being too nice - can we say pushover? David is far too nice for his own good and it's far too easy to get him to do whatever you want him to

<b><u>Magical Stuffs</u></b>
<b>Patronus (for fifth years and older):</b> Dove - universal sign for peace and innocence.

<b>What would your character smell if they sniffed Amortentia (the love potion)? </b>
 Roses and wine. David has a romanticized view of love. He's never experienced love but he looks forward to the day he finally does.

<b>Do you think your character is capable of successfully employing a Cruiciatus Curse?  Why or why  not? </b> 
No way. He's far too sweet/nice for that kind of thing.

<b>Describe how your character would react, in the form of a sample RP, if faced with a Dementor.  </b>
As soon as David had caught sight of the Dementor, he'd hid. It wasn't the bravest of actions but, deep down, he knew that he couldn't produce a Patronus. 

Running around, screaming, trying to fight would only get in the way of those that were capable of fighting such a thing and David didn't want to do that.

As a first year ran past, he grabbed her and pulled her into the spot with him. ""Shhhhh,"" he motioned, trying to give her the most reassuring look he could muster. ""Just sit here,"" he whispered. ""It'll go away soon.""

Everyone was afraid. David was afraid but he was trying his hardest to keep from surrendering to that fear. Things that had never bothered him before, bothered him now - his father leaving, his mother not caring, the way his youngest brother behaved. He told himself that it was all the Dementor and that those feelings would subside as soon.

He just had to stay calm.

<b>Alignment:</b> Anti-Voldemort. He's not made a stand before now and he likely wont make one but if he has to lean one way or the other, he's against what Voldemort stands for.

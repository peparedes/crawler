In other news...I told Nick I'd post about the Rico situation and so I'm going to.

Stuff between him and me is going well. Stuff between him and his ex who he lives with is going very very badly. He told her that we were seeing each other and she flipped. She wants him to not spend any time alone with me until they aren't living together anymore (he's moving out probably the 9th or 10th of January). We're not going to not see each other at all, but we're going to try to see each other less over the next two weeks because he doesn't want to hurt her more than he has, and I don't want him to. It really really sucks though. I know two weeks isn't that long a time...but I'll mainly see him at work and it's so hard to be near him and not be able to speak freely, or touch him, or anything. And the week after Christmas I'm doing overnight, so I'll barely see him at all. 

I'm whining, I'll stop. It's just so frustrating...It sucks so much to not be able to do ANYTHING to help a situation."

"event","""Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.""

First off, where on earth did the notion that Humpty was an egg come from?? I see nothing in the rhyme that implies that. Yet, in every picture in nursery rhyme books, he is portrayed as an egg. Ridiculous.

I definitely agree with what UFO said. Humpty was suicidal. Why else would he be sitting up on that wall?? The question is WHY he was suicidal. Which brings me to my next point.

Why were the king's horses and the king's men so close at hand? And why were they so anxious to put Humpty back together? The way I see it, the story plays out like this:

Humpty Dumpty knew secrets about the country across the sea. The country that the kingdom was at war with at that time. He was captured by all the king's men, who intended to bring him before the king to reveal what he knew. Humpty, ever faithful to his native land, refused. He daringly fought off the men and their horses and ran, with his captors in hot pursuit. He made it to the edge of the castle grounds, where there was a very high wall barricading him in. There was only one thing he could do: climb. He made it to the top of the wall, but his fear of heights had slowed him a bit, and the king's men were gaining. Humpty had no choice but to throw himself from the top of the wall.

All the king's horses and all the king's men made their way to the gates as quickly as they could, and rode to find Humpty's broken body on the other side of the wall. Try as they might, they could not heal him; his wounds were too serious, and, alas, medieval medicine was none too helpful. Unable as they were to get the information that Humpty knew, the kingdom lost the war and was conquered by the kingdom across the sea.

And so, Humpty's noble act was recorded, albiet cryptically, for all to read, so all could remember how he sacrificed himself for the sake of his home.

Now that you know how the story of Humpty Dumpty truly came to pass, you may admire his courage and selflessness each time you read his tale."

Kaley...Lindsey...Tamber...Kara...Craig...ummmmm...I don't know if there were more than that. I was all over Craig, it was weird. I had a long, loud conversation about Target with Ryan (how sad, even in drunkeness that's all I talk about). And lots of people were grabbing my boobs. It was really wierd. Mostly Kaley, I think, but lots of other people, too. And I remember wanting to take care of people. Monette was really sick and I felt bad that I was too drunk to help. And I remember falling down a lot...but I suppose that's just a normal part of being that drunk. God that was fun!! I wish I could remember more. Meh, oh well.

Happy New Year everyone!!!! The first new year of the year!!"

I feel like vomitting, and there's no toilet in which to do so...I'm going to Sooper's to buy a plunger. Does Sooper's even sell plungers? Well, I guess I'll find out, eh?"

"event","I should not be trusted around motor vehicles. Nothing good ever comes of it. 

But we do have a strong mailbox. A very, very strong mailbox.

Strong enough to pull one side of my bumper AWAY from my car. 

So here's what happened.

I was backing out of the driveway, trying to go to work, and I'm used to parking in the righthand spot. Only this time, I'd parked in the lefthand spot. I backed out how normally do, though, back and to the left so I can get actually get off from the driveway and not the curb.

Only that didn't work, since I was already in the lefthand spot.

My back wheels went over the driveway, fine, and so I started turning, looking behind me so I wouldn't hit anyone. While I was looking back, it was quite impossible for me to look forward at the same time. And since the back of the car cleared, I didn't think there'd be problem with the front.

I was wrong.

The side of the car hit the mailbox. Which would have been ok. Except that just as I hit the mailbox (the exceedingly sturdy, Amazing Wonder-Mailbox), one of my wheels went off the curb. Any NORMAL mailbox would have fallen over at that point. But ours? Noooo, ours would NEVER fall over. 

Instead, the post (a big fat wooden one), which had been positioned right behind the bumper at that point, refused to budge. So the bumper decided that since the post wasn't going to move, it was going to have to. So most of the car went down the curb, while the bumper (with the exception of the blinker, which popped off) stayed hooked around the mailbox post.

So, at that point, the car was pretty much wrapped around the mailbox. It wouldn't go forward or backward, and the mailbox still wouldn't budge. So skipping most of the police stuff (no accident report, since it was my mailbox and my car), I had to pay $50 for a tow truck to pull it sideways off the mailbox. 

I shall post pictures when Tamber gets them developed.

And today's developments in the story, duct tape can do a great number of things, but it could not save my blinker. I taped the grille thingy (erm...the radiator?? uhh...) and the headlight back onto the car because they were loose, but the blinker was completely off. So I tried taping it on as well. It was too fond of freedom, apparently, and is now in hundreds of shiny orange bits all over 287.

Poor Derdlim."

As you know, (actually, not, because I actually don't think I've mentioned this...what's the matter with me??? I don't think I've told any of my online friends, how upsetting.) I'm moving out of my mum's house into a house with some friends. Tonight is probably my last night here, and as we still haven't figured out the computer situation at our new place, I probably won't be on for a while. Hopefully not too long of a while, but I'm not sure. I just wanted to say bye to everyone, and I love you guys to bits, and I'll miss you!!!!!!!!! 

I may be on tomorrow sometime, but I just wanted to make this my official goodbye in case I can't come on.

wallet - plain black
hairbrush - turquoise and black paddle brush. That I desperately need to clean out
toothbrush - ummmmm, blue, i think

coffee cup - don't really have one

favorite top - my purple mesh shirt, my ""reality is a nice place to visit.."" shirt, my black hoodie
cd in stereo right now - ""Adventures in Singing""...for my voice class 
piercings - two in each ear, and I've been thinking of getting my eyebrow done. 
what you are wearing now - black and white striped shirt, blue pyjama pants with stars, and navy blue panties
hair - still multicoloured. a few shades of brown with a bit of red and black
makeup - normally nothing...occasionally some lip gloss. Unless I'm going out, then I'll wear more than that

who or what (was/is/are)
in my head - nothing. Well, not nothing. But I started to wonder what was in my head, and that pretty much pushed everything else out.

talking to - no one at all
eating - nothing
if you could get away with it and murder anyone, who and for what reason - never never never

what are some of your favorite pig out foods - oreos
what's something that you wish people would understand - I don't know
what's something you wish you could understand better - what in the world makes people think they can do some things. For a kind of lame example, guests at work. Honestly. There's a table of shirts, nicely folded. They're all the same style. Why in heaven's name do they need to unfold one of each color, in the same size, and strew them all over the table?? They'll all be the same bloody size.
anyone you miss that you haven't seen in a long time - Tim, Christina, Nick (even though I did see him recently, I hven't really gotten to hang out with him in a while), Sean (always...I miss him as soon as I leave Arwa's each week), Sarah..."

Well, I like a guy at work. And I'm actually (though extremely slowly) getting up the nerve to say more than hello and how are you to him. Not much more, but I'm getting there. He's 26 though...my mom would/will kill me if/when she finds out. I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens...I need to not be such a flaming coward.

I'm glad I get to go to see Regionals tomorrow, I haven't gotten a chance to see the show yet and am very excited!! It worked out well, they scheduled me until 5:30 tomorrow, so I didn't have to switch with anyone. Now, for State...being the moron I am, I didn't realize that the schedule for that week was coming out so soon, so I didn't ask for the day off in time. So now I'm hoping that someone will be able to switch with me for a different day or something. 

Umm, what else...I've been spending a whole lot of time with my sister, which is awesome. It's great hanging out with her and our coworkers. She's corrupting me though...3 times the past couple of months I've had to stay at her place because I couldn't drive. Plus the fact that she's addicting me to Sex and the City. I've watched more of that show the past couple of weeks than anything else combined...thaaat's ok though. At least I'm having fun, eh? It feels sort of strange though, because she's good friends with so many of these people, and while I'm getting to be friends with some of them, it still mostly feels like they're HER friends, not mine. Well, I guess I'll get over that in time.

Ooh and I may have found a roommate!! Well, no, not MAY have found, I did find one, it's just that now we need to find a place. It's a girl from work/school, Tamber. Should be fun!! I love my mom so much, it's just that we get along so much better when I'm not living at home, and I'm sick of fighting all the time. Besides, I'm 18, it's about time I move out.

So, that is the life of Laila at the moment. I'll try to update more often...although I'm sure I say that all the time and it never happens...but I WILL try. I'm off to watch Cowboy Bebop now!! WOOT! Love you all!!"

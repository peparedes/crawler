One story I laugh at.. is that my brother was 5..and (this is before I was born) him and my mom went to 7-11 and there was a midget..he said ""Aww, mommy, look at the orphan..."" and the midget said to my mom ""I've been called many things.. but never an orphan"" LOL what a loser..

A: He breathes. Well, any guy who breathes must slowly, and painfully die, but this is my dad. Have you ever just got so annoyed by someone? Like the way they say things just makes you wanna hit them? And if anyone else said it that it would be perfectly fine, but its JUST them.. Thats how I feel EVERY time he speaks.

I mean.. you HAVE to be high to wear pajamas with footies and shapes like triangles above your head..

Dragon Lady was quite funny yesterday:
I asked my dad for icecream and I got ""the look""
and she said..
""No, you dont mess with a woman when shes like this...
You try walking around with a 'feminine product' shoved up yourself""
and he tried to recover by saying [manly voice] ""Its like that one tampon joke...""
spit it out, dad, then he said ""what?""
and drogan lady just said ""Dont be an ass, kevin""
and he just said ""well I saw that look in your eye...""
""just shuttup and get the god damn icecream""

Right now I feel like...why do people back stab... exspecially about their bestfriends?
Its bugging me so much that people say things so freely and act like it never happens to them. If you dont like someone then dont bother being their friend, its not fair. Im so happy that my close friends dont do that gay shit to me, and honestly, if they did its not like I would break things off, I just wouldnt trust them that much, you know you're my close friend if I dont hold back many secrets. 

Just remember, it may seem as tho nothing bad will happen when you say things about people that you know they wouldnt like to be said about them. But in the end your bill comes. Thats the way it is. Thats karma.

Thats not like myself though.

It burns my eyes to see
Pieces of what used to pump blood-
Throughout my body on the floor.
I only still loved you with every broken piece,
But that doesnt mean I didnt want
To choke you with them.
The crying was only a side effect of my hate for you
And I wish I just saved every tear
So I could fucking drown you in them.
And my only wish..
Was to disturb you with my thoughts,
See if they chop you into pieces.
Or just to narrow it down:
I only wish the worst for you.
Yes, you still have my heart,
Too bad it desnt work anymore.

HCOStarfish52: aww thats sad

Do I stress you out?
My sweaters on backwards and inside out
And you say how appropriate
I dont dissect everything today
I dont mean to pick you apart you see
But I cant help it
There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splinter ruler
It would knock me to the ground if I wasnt there already
If only I could hunt the hunter
All I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance...
Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why Im relentless and all strung out
Im consumed by the chill of solitary
Im like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit in out
Im frustrated by your apathy
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
Im humbled by his humble nature..
And what I wouldnt give to find a soul mate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldnt give to meet a kindred"

Second Semester first day: lol wonderful, Trisha is in my fourth hour and I swear to god Mrs. Albright is gonna hate us. I thought Mr. Jones was mad at me cuz he didnt talk to me too much when I came back from Georgia (by the way Angel is wonderful, I missed Maria tons, and I have 5 of the cutest little girls for nieces: Judy,Jade,Mary-Jo,Sheryl, and Alisa!) anyways then he gave me a real big hug and licked my forehead lol (so hardcore) he completely rocks my socks ;) Im happy.
Too bad my dad is such a queer or I would have had alot more fun in Atlanta..
Anyways afterschool I decided Im going to have two kids, one girl and one boy.. heres the hardcore brilliant idea: Im gonna name them mom and dad.. Like that one? lol TJ helped me out.. But then Steve said no.. I have to name the boy Steven Richard lol. Okay Steve as long as you have a girl and name her Kaelen =)
Aphex Twins... the only kind of music with out words that completely rocks..so hardcore man. Anyways Im gonna go meet Amber halfway (snow day biatch!) yeah baller. Later on I might go to the mall with Trish and Steve (havent seen steve in so long lol) Alrighty, so if you think I have a life then go ahead and keep reading my newer entries (when I type them up)"

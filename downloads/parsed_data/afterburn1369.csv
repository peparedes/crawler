butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
kill the headlights and put it in neutral
stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
baby's in Reno with the vitamin D 
got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat 
someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
don't believe everything that you breathe 
you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
so shave your face with some mace in the dark
savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park 
Forces of evil on a bozo nightmare 
ban all the music with a phony gas chamber 
'cuz one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
one's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
the daytime crap of the folksinger slob
he hung himself with a guitar string
a slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
you can't write if you can't relate
trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
and my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite

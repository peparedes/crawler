"event","Okay, so first of all, its been a year since I posted. Umm...hi, internet.

Anyway, tonight I went over to Eric and Jamie's for bratwursts (very yummy) while there, I get a call from the girl working midnights tonight. She is crying. She asks if I can work for her tonight. I ask why, because, ya know, midnights suck and I try to avoid them. She says 'some shit went down' and she's afraid she's going to jail. I take this to mean she's hiding from the cops. Logical assumption, I thought. So I go into Shell a little bit before I have to work and she's there. 
So I sneak up behind her, lean against the counter and ask ""If you're here, why can't you work tonight?""
""Oh, I just got back. I guess I can work tonight.""

Apparently her boyfriend had kicked her out and tried to burn her stuff. She had just managed to get it all moved. She was afraid of going to jail because she was technically trespassing to get it back, and there was some kind of scuffle involved with her ex man. People are crazy.

So I'm standing outside the gas station smoking a Black and Mild when LJ randomly drives up. He tells me he's about to go meet Romy and Cosmo at Huddle house. (he doesn't say Romy, of course, he says Jes. And for that matter, he says cosy instead of Cosmo.) So I head over there, drink some coffee. John and Jes go home, and I'm smoking in the parking lot with LJ and some girl named Hillary, when across the street we notice a guy and a girl in the middle of some kind of domestic dispute. So we watch. After a few minutes of heated words, they both start walking in other directions. Because I am who I am, I holler to the girl (who happened to be the closer of the two) ""Hey, you need a ride?"" And she comes over and borrows my phone to call a friend of hers. (would you want to get in a truck with me if you just met me? I wouldn't.) So we're standing by my truck when the dude comes back. They get into another heated argument and she accuses him of blacking her eyes in the past and says she's afraid he'll beat her if they go home together. (they're engaged). I'm glad that at this point LJ was there, because I'm kind of bad at calming people down. If LJ wasn't there, I probably would have gotten into a fist fight with the guy. He convinces them to come back into the Huddle House for some coffee. While in there the girl manages to get a hold of a friend and has him come to pick her up. While waiting, the couple continue to argue, the guy being much calmer than the girl, who continues to takee offense to anything he says. (She may be justified, he may be a horrible abusive controlling asshole. I have no way to know the truth of the situation, though he did seem jealous any time she mentioned one of her male friends.) After about half an hour, the two manage to somewhat come to terms and agree to go home together. So when her friend gets there he gives them a lift.

Now, I said all that, to ask this: Why the HELL would she go home with him if he's abusive? And why the hell does that bother me? I don't know these people. I should have no reason to care. I'll probably never see/talk to them again. Yet I'm worried that right now she's lying bleeding on thee floor of her apartment. And I just wonder, what the hell could I do? Would it have been bettere to get into a fight with the guy ratheer than let her calm down and go home with him? I don't know. I'm just frazzled by this. People are irrational and there's nothing to be done with it. I have no idea why I posted this, I just had to put it out there."

The last time I posted was sometime in February, but it feels as if that was only like last week, not three months ago. Time goes so damned fast, kind of pisses me off. Nothing much has really changed, but so very much has not stayed the same. I don't really feel all that comfortable writing shit on here, and no one really gives that much of a fuck anyway.

I had the realization lately that I am a transient friend, for the most part. The friendships that I form often tend out to be temporary, never really lasting that long. I have no idea why, I can just see it as a continuing pattern in my life. During Elementery school and Middle school, I was friends with a couple of guys. Once we got into High School, I just kind of stopped talking to them. I realized I had nothing in common with them. I got into church ~shudders~ and became friends with Cassie and Shannon, but even that didn't last for very long. They graduated HS, went to college for a while, and kind of dissolved. Shannon got married, and I haven't talked to Cassie in forever. If you don't know about the recent reason for several of my 'friends' to stop talking to me, I'm not going to explain it. (Though Ryan and I are friends again) But the fact that I drift away from my friends isn't really the heart of it. I'm a secondary character in the social circles in my life. I say this not to complain, or to garner pity or sympathy or whatever the hell else there is, but simply to put it down somewhere solid and see if I'm crazy or not. I may read this in three months and think ""What the hell was I on?"", but right now, and lately, I've realized that I am not the reason for a gathering. I might help instigate it, it might even be my idea. But the reason you come to my party isn't to see me, its to see someone else. Not to say that you don't like me, or enjoy my company. I'm just not your primary concern. I'm secondary. To everyone. And secondary characters always drift into obscurity and get replaced.
I don't really know what I'm trying to say, other than I really believe that all the people I'm friends with right now, I probably won't even be talking to in ten years. People will change, relationships will shift, I'll do more stupid shit. I don't know where I'll be ten years, and I don't know who will be there with me.
I'm a transient friend. A secondary character."

"event","So, after waiting patiently in Sparks Hall for what seemed like an eternity (hour and a half, tops, probably less, I have a bad sense of time. Almost as bad as my sense of commas.) I become enrolled in Murray state for the Spring term, then after finding my new Advisor and getting him to fill out my ARP form (I forget what it stands for, but it basically means I've been a bad boy), taking that back to Sparks, and using the phone in the lobby to call Racer Touch, I am scheduled for classes. Woot. I've got English 101, because I had a D in there and need a C for what I'm doing now (an A wouldn't hurt, either). Civ 102, because I failed it, Philosphy something, because I failed it, and Art 121 because I failed that. Also, I'm taking a National Government class because I can take up to 16 hours, have to take at least 12, and anything over 12 is kind of 'free'. They charge the same tuition for up to 18 hours as they charge for 12. So I've got fifteen hours, set up so that I should be out by 11ish on most days, so hopefully I can find somewhere to work. Pizza Hut didn't call me again. I'm going to call them back tommorow, and if they dodge me one more time, giving me sweet phrases like 'you've been approved' and 'the manager will call you tommorow' I'm gonna hit the dirt and find someplace else to work. I think I'll have better luck with my hair pulled back and my beard trimmed up nice and spiffy. Also, I'm feeling confrontational and will be more assertive that I need the job, and that I can do whatever the hell it is they need someone to do.  I have no idea what I just did, but I tried to hit CRTL+T to open up a new tab, and it didn't work. It just kind of reloaded this page with my text intact. Weirdness.

On a more metaphysical note, I feel like I'm starting fresh this semester. I've got very little left to tie me down. I think I'll be able to make new friends, talk to be people, be social without giving myself a nervous breakdown. Join either the Philosophy club, or maybe get back into Drama :|. I dunno. I'll have to see. I need to clean my room up and arrange it in a way that it feels condusive to doing things. Going to classes, making friends, being active. Right now its kind of an energy drain. Its arranged in a manner similar to what would happen if a massive hand just tossed all my belongings into a rectangular shaped space, then littered it with soda cans. 
Until next time!

I am listening to an internet radio thing from download.com. It is pretty gnarly, for the record. What record that would be, I have no idea. Whatever I did with my CRTL button combo earlier must have logged me out, and I appear to have forgotten which password I used on this site. Damnit."

"event","Hey, I just thought I'd update since I told myself I was going to put words to something every day this year, whether its on paper, on LJ, or a nondescript word document on my computer. Being that I was about to go to bed, I figured I'd go do a LJ entry. Not to mention there is a lot brewing in my mind right now.

I've tried to be the good guy all my life. Tried to do the right thing. Tried to be there for anyone who might possibly need me. I've always wound up taking the backseat as far as girls go, since they could only see me as a 'friend' since I was trying to be so damned supportive. Well, my recent conclusion? Fuck that. If  I live in a world in which the bad guy always gets the girl, and the good guy gets fucked over, then fuck that. I'm not going to try and be the world's Superman anymore. I'm not going to listen to you at 2am when you're crying, and I'm not going to be there for you when you think your world is caving in. I no longer give a shit if your boyfriend lied to you. Fuck you. 
Superman's dead.

"event","As I sit here, munching on crackers and a bolonga and cheese sandwhich (hey, I'm hungry and its late), the skies crackle and flash with a small storm. I'm safe, tucked here in my basement. Assuming the ghost next door doesn't get me, but that's another issue entirely (one for which I should see a shrink). But what's truly captivating my mind right now is my sense of 'Good'. Everyone, everywhere, strives to be 'good'. However, the definition of such good varies wildly, as do the means for which good is accomplished.

So, what's my point, exactly? I'm not really sure. I may have stopped having a point when I stopped thinking about this and started writing. It just seems to me that my motivations and subsequent actions seem to differ from those around me. Even those I tend to agree with in terms of right and wrong, good and bad.

The main difference here is helping people. Now, not like anything major, just little things. My mental evalution about whether or not I'll do something for someone when asked (or without being asked, if I notice it) is pretty simple. How hard or time consuming the thing to do is, and how much I value the person. If my value of the person is above what it would cost me in terms of time, money, energy, or sanity, I go ahead and do it. For me, however, I tend to value people very highly. There are several people I know that they'd have to ask something really damn crazy for me not to do it. this really ain't making a lot of sense, is it? And if it is, its probably irrelevant.

I consider myself to be a different kind of good. My sense of good does not derive from a divine code of laws, or even from a man-made code of laws. My sense of good is self-made, it is what makes the most sense in a given situation, that which benefits myself and those I value, so long as it does not harm those who may be innocent (or non-participatory). I also tend to try and help anyone around me that I value who needs it. I try to protect from harm those near me. I try to always be available if someone needs me. I haven't turned my phone off at night in a really, really damned long time. I don't know what that says about my personality. I don't know if I have a Hero-complex that needs satisfying, or if I'm just trying too damn hard to always do the right thing. I dunno.

I'll end this one with a quote from Preacher that really hit home for me. Its paraphrased, because I don't feel like looking it up.

""You gotta be one of the good guys, because there's way too many of the bad guys"""

"event","So, its officially Christmas. Spent a good portion of the day Christmas shopping, managed to get threw it without having to kill anyone, so I consider that a victory. I even had my knife on me.

I don't really know why I'm posting, I just thought it had been a while. I'm still looking for a job, If my resistance breaks down I'll probably apply at Ponderosa after Christmas so I can earn enough money to pay back my mom, pay for gas, and make the first few payments on my tuition. (I'm going to get a loan, but I won't be able to get it until after the first payment on my MSU balance comes due, so I'll probably wind up having to pay Murray a small amount out of my own empty pockets so they don't purge me from whatever classes I narrowly manage to get into.)

Hmm...sounds like someone is stirring upstairs. Weird. Its like 2am. Oh, it was Eric, I just heard his door close.

Time for random poetry, this is from my senior year at MCHS (I think it was senior, the twelve years kind of makes it seem that way. Whatever year I had Pre-Cal. I have urges to write at weird times. Like when I'm trying to sleep in Pre-Cal. Anyways, this is like the one thing that I've written that I actually like. I know it isn't actually any good, its very amateurish, but I don't feel bad about that, since I'm kind of an amatuer poser writer. I'm posting it now because I was thinking about the inspiration for it a few weeks ago, and it still freaks me out a little bit. but that's all I'm going to say on the inspiration, I don't think I've ever told anyone who it was, and I never plan to.) That whole thing probably should not have been a parenthetical statment, but once I start with those parathesis I just can't stop!

Eyes

I saw you sitting across the room today
I've known your face,
For twelve long years,
I've seen it a thousand times

Your bright smile
Your perfect skin
Your head cocked slightly
A puzzled expression, with an open mouth

But today, I saw your eyes.
they had dark circles under them
And in their depths
They held no light

What happened to you,
Oh once sweet beauty,
To dim that eternal flame
In your now dark eyes?

Tell me your story
Tell me your pain
Let me find the light
That you are striving to regain

You know me only by name
And I know you just the same
So break your heart to this stranger
And, perhaps, today he'll set you free"

I gots me a job again, working at a Hawaiin Tropic....warehouse? I'd feel dishonest if I said factory. I'm the dude who puts the invetory stickers on the carboard boxes and tapes them open....but my coworkers know me by another name....and that name is......FANBOY! Erm, yeah. I accidentally got put in charge of moving the fan around because it wason the pallet behind me. I did not ask for this job, but when the need arose.....I said 'Move the fan yourself, damnit'. Which did not work, so I moved the fan. Because when a pregnant woman who is overheating glares at you and tells you to do something, YOU DO IT.

Erm, yeah, my brain is apparently short circuiting, but I've got a job, so life is good for now. Now, in three weeksn and I want to shoot myself because my feet hurt from standing on them for eight hours a day, life will not be so good. But for now, Nirvana.

Maybe not quite Nirvana, since I'm in my room all by myself, without someone here with me, but close, damnit.

The guy I work across from was in the Army for 21 years, fought in Vietnam, few other places I don't think we 'offically' were at, and in Desert Storm for a while. He likes to ramble on, but its interesting to hear him talk about shooting people, makes the day more pleasant.

That's about it. I'll probably try to call Mica later, after nine when she -might- be home.

Peace out, homies."

"event","So, my job at SouthEastern ended Thursday, and as such I'm currently unemployed, yet again. They gave the permanment position to a girl that I worked with. she wasn't bad, but she wasn't as good as me, which sort of irritiated me, but I guess that's just life.

Romy is leaving Saturday to go to NE, which should be good for her. I'm riding down to Nashville with her to see her off.

I need to find a new job, apparently there is still an opening at the dam for a bus-boy, so I may do that. I'm not sure though, might try to find something different.

Guess, like always, I haven't got much to say right now. So laters people."

Haven't done a whole lot lately, been doing the work thing pretty steady, thinking about going down to the Dam and applying as a bus-boy. They're hiring, and Ryan got a job as that, and Jessica is working as hostess, so it would prolly be a pretty sweet job. Only problem is My current job doesn't end until the 23rd, and they might want to start soon. Sigh. And I can't just quit the job I've got right now, I need it and the next two-four checks to pay my car insurance. When I start at the dam it'll take like a freaking month to get a damned paycheck. Plus I'd be working for the government, technically ~runs in terror~.

~comes back~ Oh, right. You're still here.

So am I. Hopefully fun will be had at the apartment this weekend. Who knows. At least my computer has new RAM. ~dances~. That's about it. Wish I had something significant to say. Ah, well, its my journal and I guess I can fill it with pointless self-absorbed drivel if I want to. Adios"

Ryan just headed home not long ago, we went to Waffle House and hung out for a while.
I feel kind of messed up right now, I just hit a big disphoria and I'm not entirely sure why. I was talking to Mica online for a minute and she left to go to bed because she didn't know what time it was and she was up too late. I should go to sleep too, but I try not to sleep when I'm all depressed, makes it hard to get up in the morning. (Go to sleep happy, wake up refreshed. Go to sleep depressed, wake up and hit snooze).  I think I might just be sad because I really wanted to talk to her and I didn't get to. I called her earlier today but she never called me back. Logically, it doesn't bother me. But the fact still remains that I didn't get to talk to her hardly at all. I know this shouldn't make me sad, but that doesn't alter the fact that I am sad.

On the up side, I get to hang out with Lily Saturday :). Haven't seen her in ages, she's a sweetie.

well, just felt like checking in, adios guys."

"event","So, yeah, after paying back my parents for my new front tires and filling up my gas tank, I've got around 40 bucks left. Not a big deal, I don't need money for anything other than gas to and from work during the week, right? Wrong, I need a new starter or something. Car wouldn't crank up this morning, so we've got to get it towed and repaired. Once again, my parents are going to loan me some money and I'm going to pay them back. ~babbles~ But I'm good :). I was on my way to go see Mica when I discovered the car not working, so I called her and she came over here and we played Trivial Pursuit for a couple hours then just kinda lounged around. Life is good. I hadn't seen her in like a week, I felt Mica deprived. I feel really relaxed and recharged and ready to go to work next week so I can earn enough money to repair my car. And go bowling with Lily on Saturday. WHEEE.

The big 'party' at Cambridge was a bust. Cops wouldn't allow the party to be outside so they crammed it into everyone's apartments (a lot of people just didn't show). They set up the DUI checkpoint right in front of Jessica's apartment, so we all just sat outside and watched the police. Interested, but no 'party'

Ah well, until next time amigos."

"event","yeah, so, I've gots me a job working at Southeastern Book Company updating their used book prices on Amazon. Wow. I haven't been able to put it that succintly yet. I'll have to remember that. Its a pretty job, just sit around and input ISBN numbers and alter prices according to competition prices. Today was my fourth day working. We work a 9-5 shift, Mon-Fri. Suppose to last 6-8 weeks. I'm hoping for eight, that'd be sweet. Its easy, just gets mindnumblingly dull after a few hours. The two 15 minute breaks help, and lunch is like starting the day fresh, but it still gets old. yeah, wow, I bet that was really boring. I find I actually have a good work ethic once I start working. (assuming I'm being paid) I work as fast as I can to get as much of whatever I've got to do done. I priced around 600 books today, whereas everyone else did around 400, I think. Makes me feel all warm and spiffy inside. (can one feel spiffy?)

On the weird side, the only station that we can get on a radio inside the office is Froggy, a local country station. My cell phone also gets no reception inside the walls, though it works fine outside. It appears to be a normal metal building, though it might be a front for a secret government project for jamming signals....hmm...

I got a flat tire last night on the way home from Draffenville. Had to call my dad to help me change it, I put the jack in the wrong place. But I got new front tires this morning and I know owe my parents around a hundred dollars. Such is life. My fault though, I should have replaced them with one of my checks at Seapac instead of wasting it. I'll be able to repay them by next Friday though, since I'll get a full week's worth of work this week.

On an off note, we need to have another party soon. And play lots of Last Dance with Mary Jane...for certain reasons.If only I could dance. ~evil cackle~"

I totally screwed up a computer I had some things on I wanted to get off of it. That was a crazy sentance. It was working okay enough to get things out of, then I tried to install XP on it thinking 'this will make things work better'. However, it will not finish installing XP and each time I boot it up it goes straight to the installation. Pisses me off. I want to crucify someone from Microsoft. But someone unimportant, like a janitor. Because I buy a lot of Microsoft products, I wouldn't want to hurt their productivity. Just send them a message.

erm, yeah, murderous rage aside, I'm going to Gloria's Friday. So, wahoo, you know. (Gloria's is a really cool international cafe in Murray)

That's all, really, except its almost 3am and I should be asleep."

"event","A Mike's sounds really good now...hmm...maybe I should remedy that later tonight.

No work today. Or possibly for the rest of the week. That makes me happy, I want to go swimming and spend some time with friends. I feel like I havne't seen anyone. Which, I haven't really seen anyone except Romy, which kinda sucks. (I love you, really.) I just wanna go and hang out and have fun, relax a little. Friends are good things to have.

On another note, in order to have a right to life, must one be worthy of that life? Did I just totally miss the full meaning of 'deserve victory'? No one has responsibility for anyone's life but their own (except at their disgression). If that statement is true, then abandoning your children before they are old enough to fend for themselves is a morally correct course of action. Being worthy of your life means that you can survive on your own without compulsory aid from another. Obviously, I need a grocery store to survive (I'm not to keen on foraging in the woods), but that isn't compulsory, its volunterry trade. However, a newborn child cannot survive without the aid of a parent. The parent is legally compelled to provide for the youth. There is no trade involved. Is that moral? Arg. Is it moral for the parent to deny the child they conceived food and shelter, to the point of death?"

I've got to work from 3-9 again today, but I think I'll be off until at least next weekend after today. Unless Integrity calls me. Someone said I was on the schedule for next weekend, so boo-yah, more work.

I'm just so glad I didn't have to work the breakfast/lunch rotation today. Breakfast is always nuts on Sunday, plus they had some big party coming in during lunch. Craziness!
Being that I'm off tommorow, I should get my ass down to Taco John's and get that job. Though I swear if the same guy interviews me I'm gonna be pissed. I'm amazed he could tie his own shoes. He was either stoned, drunk, or stoned and drunk the night before. Oh, well, I don't really have anything significant to say at the moment, just thought I'd post and waste some cyberspace. Adios."

Well, I'm about to be off to work, and hopefully it won't be as crazy as crab legs night. Last time I worked on a Saturday it was easy enough, so should be okay. (even though I think we have a massive party coming in at seven. They should be done and out by nine or soon after. If not, I can always chase them off with a broomstick. We have lots of those).

Hopefully I'll find something to do after work tonight. So if I call you, Ms. Ophelia, don't be suprised.

On another note, what aspects other than a belief in a diety that supercedes reason, can allow an individual to drop reason and commit a crime? (Such as rape, murder, even theivery). I believe that a belief in a diety is something that creates the majority of the crime and bloodshed around the world, but it is not alone. There must be other things. One obvious answer is greed, and hate. But what allows these emotions to become so powerful that they overcome reason? Hmm...more on this later, I'll think about it while cleaning tables and contemplating stabbing customers who come in at 8:50."

Ah, well, it just irks me since I was going to go see Mica this evening after work, but I got off so late that I didn't have a chance to. When I called her she was on her way to bed. Such is life, I'll just have to wait until next week to see her. Its not like its a big deal, I just like seeing her. Thinking of her and knowing that I'll get to see her later makes everything that I have to do so much easier. When I was working at Seapac on that damned 115 degree platform sweating my ass off, I just had to think to myself that I'd be able to use the money I was earning to go spend time with her, and it was all good.

I know how horribly pathetic that sounds, but I gotta motivate myself somehow.

Ah, well, its the same hours for tommorow and Sunday. Shouldn't be as bad though, no crab legs to clean up."

"event","I'm just a sitting in my room waiting for the time to come to leave for work. I've got to stop by Integrity and pick up my paycheck. Hopefully I won't have to rough up the bastards, but if they don't give me my check ~draws finger across throat~ I need my thirty dollars, damnit.
Tonight is seafood buffet night. That means huge crowds of people and....CRAB LEGS! Now, crab legs may not scare the normal individual, but I always get stuck with vaccuuming up at the end of the night because the guy I normally work with is a bastard. Not really, he just hates vacuuming.
Sigh...I hope we manage to get out close to nine tonight, no matter how unlikely that is. I'm going to call Mica and see if she wants to hang out late tonight. Maybe watch a movie or something. I don't really give a damn what we do, I just wanna be around her. Sigh, someone shoot me, I'm pathetic. And on top of it all, I don't have a clean shirt to change into after work even if I do get to go see her. Pisses me off. I've got my clothes washing now, but they won't be dry by the time I leave.

Eh, enough bitching. Life still rocks."

"event","Well, being that this is my first post I think I'll say 'hi' to all the people out there who are not reading this because they have no bloody clue that it exists.

Heh.

Seriously, I suppose I should put down on virtual paper what I'm up to right now, which is precicly squat, except realizing I don't know how to spell precisly properly. Damnit. I'm just sitting at home, trying to think of something to do tonight to entertain myself, considering calling a certain friend but I don't wanna get on her nerves by calling her all the time. Sigh, such a needlessly complicated situation. Oh well, I'll probably do it anyway then wind up not doing anything tonight reguardless. Such is life. I hate just sitting around. At least I have work tommorow and Saturday. Yay. I need to get a more reliable job. Taco John's is hiring again. Bastards. Maybe if I go give them another application they'll hire me this time. If not, I could always just go blow them up. Yes, that solves everything. oi.

Well, I'm out guys, I'll probably write again tonight when I get all bored and pissed off at the world."

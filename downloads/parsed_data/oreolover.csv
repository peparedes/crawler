Love is...

Love is
  being happy for the other person
  when they are happy
  being sad for the person when they are sad
  being together in bad times
  Love is the source of strength

Love is
  being honest with yourself at all times
  being honest with the other person all times
  telling, listening, respecting the truth
  and never pretending
  Love is the source of reality

Love is
  an understanding that is so complete that
  you feel as if you're a part of the other person
  accepting the other person just da way they are
  and not trying to change them to be something else
  Love is the source of unity

Love is
  the freedom to pursue your desires
  while sharing your experiences with the other person
  the growth of one individual alongside of
  and together with the growth of another individual
  Love is the source of success

Love is
  the excitement of planning things together
  the excitement of doing things together
  Love is the source of the future

Love is
  the fury of the storm
  the calm in the rainbow
  Love is the source of passion

Love is
  giving and taking in a daily situation
  being patient with each other's needs and desires
  Love is the source of sharing

Love is
  knowing that the other person
  will always be with you regardless of what happens
  missing the other person when they are away
  but remaining near in heart at all times
  Love is the source of security

Love is
  the source of LIFE"

My love for you is always real
My hands touching yours
My lips kissing yours
My body against yours

Your hands rubbing up and down my thighs
Gives the chills running up and down my spine
Ooo, baby how you make me feel so good, so good
I could never let you go

You filled all the emptiness in me with love
You filled my heart with love
You filled me as a whole with love
The love of my life is you, Sheena
No one else is ever a comparsion to you
You are one of a kind I will always precious
I can just say a thousand words to decribe how I love you but
All you need to know is that my love for you is perpentual,
never stopping

My love for you is always real

I love you to the top sheena!!! -mwahs-</center>

<h2>You'll Fall in Love With An <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/arieslover.html"">Aries</a>!</h2>
You want a lover like Aries, one who knows what he / she wants and goes after it.<br>
You fall for assertive Aries almost instantly... the only sign powerful enough to sweep you off your feet.<br>
Your Aries is dominant and romantic - bringing you lots of adventure.<br>
<br>
You are attracted to people who are completely in charge.<br>
Nothing turns you on more than surrendering completely, to the right person.<br>
Symbols of power turn you on - from flashy cars to an Aries with lots of charm.<br>
<br>
The trade off is that your Aries has trouble commiting and lack stamina.<br>
You'll have to try extra hard to make the relationship fresh and fiery.<br>
Keep that burst of passion going past the third date, and you are on your way!

 that time she was with kevin, we saw them nearby us, we just were like scattering around and huiide from her to surprise her..
 we did. she shocked and smiling hugely. how cute.

 she got her ear piercing, not upper or lower.. its right middle of ear, the narrow, u know what im saying? awk, i m not good at this explanation, tho. 
  we paid it for her, how nice? hehe. 

 so we went to the MIYAKO- japanese restaurant. the price of food was so damn expenesive but i didnt care. we ordered the same food - sesame chicken. it tastes really good. the man were doing his stuff right front of us and even though, i was sitting on the middle and look so ridiculous next to other table whosever kept staring at us. 

 jennifer was so really happy, i can tell & see..

 we went to kami's place, her place is pretty nice & beautiful.

 kevin & kami gave her the present- it was homebamade presents. that was showing a real friendship. *sighs happily*

 oh oh, i drove kevin's nissan, and i already loved his damn car, mofo and he drove mine eventually. he prefered mine and i prefered his, lol. 

  so the end. :)"

 today, i went to my grandparents' house. i thought there were just nothing especially visiting with my parents.

 so i watched the tv, playin basketball, and online just for a while.

 suddenly, my grandma came to me and sayin, ""your grandfather needs you to come down here quickly."" i was like, puzzled...

 i walked outside and turned to left, and saw the DAMN FUCKING CAR!
 
 i meant, i could have jumped and screamed that i got my car!

 from there, i just stood and kept shockingly staring and smiling really huge, more than a smiley face. my grandparents and parents were standing there and looking at me proudly. 

  papa gave me a car key.. i was sooo shocked that i got my own car. it was so unbelieveable.. 

  i opened the car door and sat in the car... was soo happiest girl in the world than u'd ever imagine..

  the kind of car is ACURA- something.. ooh i dont remember. that is really embarrassing.. anyway... its blue-green and has 2 door. ofc, manual shift.. so u can't steal my car away. har har..

   i think that was it. *sighs happily* i dont have to tap my dad to beg to get me a new car 'cause i just got my CAR! YESSSS!!!"

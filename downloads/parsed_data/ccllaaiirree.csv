You take life as it is, and you find happiness in a variety of things.
You tend to be close to family and friends. But it's hard to get into your inner circle.
Making the little things wonderful is important to you, and you probably have an inviting home.
You seek harmony with others, but occasionally you have a very stubborn streak.

Your strength: Your intense optimism

Your weakness: You shy away from exploring your talents

Your power color: Jade

Your power symbol: Flower

Your power month: June</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

"event","it's remarkable how much you can overestimate somebody.  little things are important, but they are not enough to cover you're entire personality.  when the good things are few and far between its probably time to say enough is enough.  but its disheartening because i would love to believe that people are good and that people care, but it is really getting more and more difficult to believe that.  i think im coming to terms with it and accepting it but that might just be making me cynical, which i really dont want to happen.  and its amazing how little someone can really know you, and its all because they just dont care enough to ask.  maybe you're bursting to talk but nobody will ask.  society is pretty self centered.  it's good to be concerned with yourself so you dont get trampled but you need to open your eyes and see that -holy cow- there are other people on the planet.  sometimes i feel so stuck and trapped and alone that i think my heart is literally going to break apart.  luckily/unfortunately the moments are often fleeting and i push it to the back of my head, or my stomach, and i wouldnt be suprised if one day i woke up with an ulcer or a complete mental explosion.  the price we pay to be peoples sound boards.  people talk to me because i listen without fail because thats who i am but who knows, maybe i just wont anymore.  i think people should be a little bit more naive because we're all too smart and sharp for our own good.  ignorance is bliss and life is what happens when we're busy making plans.  life isnt a series of momentous moments; it is what it is, its happening now, later, before.  why does everything have to be so calculated and such a tremendous deal.  howcome we cant just relax sometimes and go slow.  everything is so fast paced and important.  why can i not find anybo(d)y that will appreciate and like and love me.  oh because im waiting for (h)i[t](m) to fall out of the sky because im not brave enough to do anything for myself.  but i would love to know from somebody that im not very unattractive.  i cant make any decisions or any friends because im complacent and trying my hardest to be oblivous to my stagnant state of being.  i give myself too much credit and not enough.  i like the fact that im the only one whose going to read this, and that thought was one of the most unsarcastic things ive ever written, even if it looks facecious.  its amazing how people change but we all miss it, unless if directly affects us, because we're primarily concerned with ourselves.  my mom and dad know me better than anyone in the world and that makes me sad sometimes because i know what they know about me makes them sad and i would rather feel it alone because i dont ever want them to blame themselves because its not their fault.  i could take/write forever about everything and nothing but its generally unimportant and i think things become too scientific and less real when people try to analyze them so much.  i appreciate simplicity and i think it speaks a whole lot louder than anything ""profound"" i would love to be simple, maybe i am i just dont know who to ask or how to find out.  i wish that the world was more innocent and less dramatic and kinder.  or i wish i could meet the people that were.  i have lots more to say. maybe someday i'll say them."

<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>when i was in kindergarten, i was walking down the block in my velcro barbie sneakers and i walked through wet cement. i was so scared i was gonna get arrested, i ran home and threw my sneakers in my moms closet.&nbsp; and the footprints are still there today.&nbsp; i had teeny feet.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>when i read/hear/think/tell ghost stories it makes my eyes tear.&nbsp; it makes me look like im crying, but im not.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i used to have this thing about getting wet with my clothes on.&nbsp; thing as in, i really wanted to do it, so once i dumped a swing full of water on myself and ran home pretending i was in a movie. lol i was so dumb.</FONT></STRONG></LI>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i used to talk to my hands alot, i pretended i was a teacher and they were my students. that might explain a little why i am the way i am.. ha.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>once, my dad cooked chicken for dinner and i adamently did not want to consume it, so i put it all in my pocket, ran upstairs, and hid it behind my dresser.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i have this theory about numbers and colors.&nbsp; all the numbers that double, like 2+2, well, 2 has such a crush on 4 that it doubles itself to get to 4.&nbsp; same for every other number.&nbsp; my color theory, which originates to when we had these little plastic cups when i was about 5, red likes blue, yellow and green are friends and pink was the princess but kinda friends with purple.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>that last point, i know, is mega weird.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i was once riding my sisters bike through my neighborhood when i was 7 and this guy in a car pulled up and tried to call me over.&nbsp; i proceeded to JUMP OFF THE BIKE, AND WALK IT HOME.&nbsp; smart kids would have ridden it... but not me.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i really like warm milk, but i can only drink it with my thumb in my mouth because thats how i always drank it and its the only way it tastes right.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i wish plaid clothes were really in style because i have a weird fixation with them.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i used to never care what anyone thought of me.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT size=1>i really hated my sister until i was like 15, and now we're best friends</FONT></STRONG></LI>

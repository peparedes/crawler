the fissures and fractures of the steps at columbia university hold secrets of my parents courtship. as i turn corners around library buildings i see my young mother toting a macrame bag, trying to hide her pack of parliament lights, pressing the tips of her fingers against each other nervously, waiting at the black steel gates for my father to walk through them. at the hungarian pastry shop she drinks black coffee and he takes milk no sugar, the dim lights complementing their smile lines, anticipating the future.

what am i to do? i am left with fragmented recollection, only moments where my mother pauses and there is an estranged look that slowly passes over her face.

"event","i cannot stand the platitude of teenage pain and the slow, plodding hum of it in my heart. i see my actions from a watchtower north of my body, taking precise notes, eyebrows raised, i see them, anticipate them, examine them in retrospect. !!we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive at the point where we started and know that place for the first time [ts elliot]. this is all i know. these answers, they are in my possession somehow, perhaps in an inside pocket or a curled up inside the vacancy of a seam rip or button hole, but i dont know where exactly and so i must continue to fervently putt putt putt. a year ago !ha i was still making the same mistakes just with slightly more caution. why of course it meant something to me! WAH WAH WAH i'm not playing that game. plus i know in a week i'll be fine. SPRING BREAK 2004 BABY YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!

i think constantly of my mother. what she might think if she studied me from the watchtower [which she does]; we could sit quietly and discuss the root of the action, the delay of consciousness, the manifest destiny of my predictable neurosis. ANTICIPATION! EXPERIENCE! SHOCK! DENIAL! REGRET! bus rides and car rides and truck stops leading to destinations pregnant with the unknown, pockets and pockets and pockets of clouded judgement and equivocals YES AWESOME COOL. there were poignant moments, i assure you reader, really. sometimes in the early white of the moment things were quiet and soft and my pink lips spoke without care or worry. i i i dont know what to say or how to articulate the synthesis of regret and pride i feel.  but i'm exaughsted from all of this foresight i want to go home now.

"event","you fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpilllar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. you might as well have the brain of a tank. you get them wrong before you meet them, while your anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; then you go home and tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. and yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the signigicance we think it has and takes on instead a significance that is ludicrous, so ill-equiped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle withour ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's gettingh them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. thats how we know we're alive; we're wrong. maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. but if you can do that - well, lucky you."

First at work-training today I did some EXTREME-buffeting. There was supposed to be 15 people but only 6 turned up, so I had two mountains of sausage rolls and mixed crisp bowl galore.
Then I went to Tescos and brought some LUSHIOUS dinners.

I am going to make myself some goals, some that can be done now and some that can be done anytime and get cracking on achieving them.
These are my life plans.
1)  Go to Las Vegas for a lost weekend of illegal activities and marriage.
2)  Divorce above
3)  Meet somebody who wants to marry me.
4)  Have 1 sprog and adopt one.
5)  Give blood.
6)  Learn to drive.
7)  Gain a healthy life style.
8)  Feed sharks.
9)  Become a nurse.
10) Become confident.

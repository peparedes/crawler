Some of my friends think that imma become a diabetic because i eat so much choco... lol's.. hopefully i wont but just in case, i've found a shop that sells sugar free choco... CAN U BELIEVE IT?! LOL'S!! sugar free choco... i bought some for my grandma cause she's a diabetic... i thought it was pretty fun... unfortunatly... the store is in las vages... LOL'S :p so yeahs... imma go to sleep but hopefully i'll update more later... TTYL'S CAITLIN!!!"

"event","well, ladies and gentlemen... i now have the funniest thing for all of you to hear. Today was one of my friends birthdays and a kinda of ""tradition"" i guess you could say, is to kidnapp the birthday person and take them out to eat or somethin like that. Today me and 3 other friends of mine went to this guys house to surprise him. We had an entire set up ready. There was cation tape (like the kind you find at a crime scene or something) surrounding his house and we set up cones around the ""evidance"". then we were gonna have a person lying on the floor like they were dead and we had 2 other people on standby and one person watching out for him. The two people on standby were supposed to put a bag over his head when he walked in. We were trying to work everything out for a while and then when we finally got it right we settled down and started talking. We had people switching off to see if he was coming. (keep in mind that we got to his house at 5p.m)then it turned to 8 and we started getting hungry so one of my friends and me went to get food and when we got back, he still hadn't come back. So then we were eating at his house with out him. which was really funny alone. Then someone said, ""we should sing happy birthday"" so we sang it. Then we finished eatinng and we just cleaned everything up and then left. lol!!! so weird but funny at the same time... well, miss you guys much and ttyl's"

"event","hey all of ya'll... well, let's see... there's not too much stuff that interesting or funny. I know that i had a good laugh yesterday. I was hanging out with my friend tiffany. She just came to the U.S for around a month, maybe a little more. Her english isn't perfect but she understands some of it and her best subject is math. (she actually likes it; i don't think she's human lol's) well, she was put in algebra 1 where they about LCD and GCF and all of that great stuff and in the middle she started to think (in chinese), ""what's xy in english?"" When she told me this I started thinking too, then i realized, but of coarse, that xy is english. really dumb i know. Then she tried teaching me more chinese because i don't know a lot of chinese names. So she was teaching me how to say Atlantic Ocean. It's Da Shi Yang in chinese. But i herd, ""Da shiang"" which mean elephant. so i was like, ""elephant? that's what they call the atlantic ocean?!"" and at first tifany was like, ""yeah yeah"" then she was like... ,""wait, NO!"" and i just started crackin up... AND SHE HAS THE CUTTEST LITTLE SISTER!!! CAITLIN YOU SHOULD TOTALLY HEAR HOW HER LITTLE SISTER SOUNDS LIKE! IT'S SOOOOOOOOO FREAKIN CUTE YOU'D B LIKE, ""OMGOSH!!!"" lol's cause her little sister does pikachu impressions and she like, ""chuuuu!!!"" lol's so cute... well yes, i know, when i explain somethin, i explain it in detail. My english teacher loves it, my friends hate it, cause it takes forever. lol's well, finally updated my livejournal w/o being told to. muchos love to u all and MISS YOU CAITLIN!!!"

"event","well, caitlin always says to update me journal... and i should really b doin this on word cause my last entry was deleted almost 3 times. But I'm just a dork sometimes... lol's... i got a lot of time on my hands cause I'm just doin the laundry rite now. Nothing else goin on. i got back from church around two and it's already four, almost five. I guess i should really practice that dance im gonna have to do next week. lol's, but it's so weird. That's bad... no one herd that... then again, of coarse u didn't, i typed it i didn't say it. Unless ur a telepath or somethin, then maybe u herd me say it. K, this is another reason why i get annoyed at having to write so many entrees, I start talkin to myself. Then someone always walks into the room and sees my face screwed up in some weird way and they're like, ""what are you doin?!"" and then im like, ""WAH!"" and then they start laughin their head off. ::sighz:: yeah, well, nothin much funni happened, except for when people saw me wearin me new jacket w/ the hood up. I think it's really cute!!! it's a black jacket w/ pictures of cats and red lines in the front, and on the hood, it has little cat ears. I think it's sooooooooo cute. A lot of people were like, ""WTHECK?!"" when they saw it. i think it was funny though. well, if i have n e ting else to say i'll come bakc on. im scared that my comp. is gonna freeze and i'll have to redo this again. :p do do do's lol's ttyl peoples"

I'm so messed up rite now. I have no clue what's goin on. I felt total hate earlier, then i felt disgusted, then i felt like an idiot, then i felt fine... now i guess kinda bad but not really. Remember dj? well, he seem's to the greatest guy. he's really nice, total christian, considerate AT TIMES (in bold for a reason), and care free... now i just feel like a total freakin idiot. I don't even like talkin about it but i know i have to in order to get it out of my system. I've known him for a while now, and my friends say that im basicly upset. I'm constantly raving on about what he's done, or wat we did, or wat happened that had to do with him? I basicly wouldn't shut up. But seriously, i feel like an idiot. No doubt about it. He is a real carefree guy, and pretty considerate at times. other times he's completely UH!!! AHHHH!!!! AND MAJOR SCREAM!!!! and now i don't want n e ting to do w/ them for a while at the least. this is/will be perminently the last entry. Part of the reason i feel this way is probably just because i strive for attention. he has a lot of friends and a lot of people from the youth i don't really talk to much well, differently... i don't know how to say it, but yeahs... and for me... i actually make myself depressed wen i find out something that i don't like. and i get jealouse easily too. and for me, i guess i go with the tantrums, and the attention now, or none at all. and the fact that im scared to hurt myself doesn't really help me either. this sucks... check bak laters:p"

(she was baking too) then she took me home... i got home... say all da ""little"" stuff that my sister had bought and was like ""ok then"" and then i went looked around the kitchen, didn't feel like eating anything, so i went up to my room... did somethin for sometime then i went and got somethin to eat and i've been hangin in my sister's room since:p p.s: SHE WONT LET ME GET MY OWN KITTEN!!!

"event","wow, i've been goin through so much in my mind even though i seem to b really weird outside... uh, did that make sence? w/e's it's like, i've been thinkin a lot because of things and i feel really bad about talking... well actually, asking a friend of mine how come he didn't get mad easily, and i don't know if im just over thinking it (which i usually do) or if i got him mad, but now i just feel bad. and i don't know wat to do. because i really like him. and i just can't stop thinking about him. I guess im just talking to caitlin here... HEY!!! THIS IS SUCH A COOL WAY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER!!! :p ok sry, i guess its good that i get sidetracked easily, but i really am troubled by this thing. I don't understand why i havn't these feelings, or why i get my self depressed just by thinking that i actually believed the things that he said, even though i know that i truely believed wat he said and i guess im just pushing him away myself and for some stupid reason, im putting my self into depression then coming back out, wongering around in his words again, and then going back to my little spot in the corner... wow, i can't even shut up about it. It's seriouly weird, and i don't understand it at all. And i feel completely helpless, i guess it's because im scared that he's going to turn out to me joking and i'll turn out to be making a complete fool of myself, which im scared to do...:p jeez i need to get a life... pooger lol...:p new word."

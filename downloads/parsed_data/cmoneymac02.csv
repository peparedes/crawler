"event","i hung out on sat with larry and his new interest.  i guess his fiance broke up with him and he is on the rebound.  hes hitting on the newer girl at work.  shes 23 and not all that great looking but still shes cool enough that i would even spend time with her.  some of you may know her little sis from middle school.  Felicia M.  missa this should ring a bell.  you two were friends for a while.  well i talked to her for a bit and we have a lot in common.  
oh yeah missa, sorry bout sat they conned me into bowling the extreme.  i din't want to but they didn't want felicia to feel like the third wheel.  im nice like that. damn my inability to say no.  you all should come down on a tuesday to bowl.  its getting to be really busy like extreme with out the expense of it.  you would have lots of fun and were open till 12.  sweet deal if you ask me.  (shameless plug i know)
outside was fun on sat on the go-carts.  it kinda rained then quit and we stayed open till about 430.  then the rain got heavier and we quit.  then people got upset and we still said screw you buddy.  then i pulled a double on sunday and had to work all dirty from power washing the walkway infront of the club house.  they are usually pissed at me for a little dirtyness any other time, but this time i asked if i could change before everyone else left and they shot me down. 
well im done for now and i will call someone this week to see whats going on and maybe start hanging out with you guys more.  sorry for falling off the face of the earth and all.  night all and my phone is still cool.

"event","i woke up and called mom at around 1230.  i saw her work number on my phone and thought she needed something.  she didn't all she wanted was to let me know she wasn't coming home for lunch.  so i took advantage of a free day til work.  i went to target to see if they might have a leather cover for my new phone.  of course they didn't.  but i did find a new corvette collectable there.  then i went over to the cingular store on chotuoe and they didn't have it either, but they said the cing store on barry and i-29 would.  so i got gas and headed out.  they didn't have it.  so i got a belt clip deal.  i knew i would need something to keep me from dropping my phone too much.  you know, those damn clip things don't work too well if they are not on your belt.  for instance i had it in my lap, not clipped to anything and i dropped it on the ground when i got out of my car.  i dropped it outside of the store too.  havent even had it for 2 days and i dropped it twice.  nice charater marks though.  and thank god i didn't break anything.  
i called sam today and surprise no answer.  oh well i wont worry about it.  ill see her again at work more than likly.  however i do need to now weather or not she is trying to get back with me.  i don't sant to get back with her yet but i think she might feel differently.  i just want to make sure things are handled differently the next time.  
we'll see when everything is staightened out.  in the mean time im going to sleep.  night all and make sure your belt clip is clipped on your belt."

thats all just wanted to get that out. night all and keep a friend close to you at all times."

"event","I have to get a root canal done soon.  i chipped a tooth a while ago and it was bothering me last night.  Bothering? no more like trying to kill me by pain.  i went to the dentist today and they put me on penicillin and hydrocodone.  it is to say the least a most memerable experiance.  i smoked a cig a little after taking them and i damn near past out before i got to the bed.  no more cigs for a while.  I just took one too so i might start typing funny.
Changing subject a bit.  Sam still says she loves me when she leaves a v-mail.  i don't get that but i like it.  i shouldn't but i do.  i hope i get a chance to talk to her mom soon.  i don't want sam to leave the area.  We havn't really talked any but i feel like we can still make it as friends.  i know for sure it will be quite a while before we date again and im fine with that.  im not even looking to start up with her again.  
jody is a good friend and im glad he spends time with me.  we played pool to night and then me him and adrian came over here to watch Radio.  very good movie and very touching.  i love it.  buy the dvd its worth every penny.  
well my head feels like a hundred pounds so i better get t osleep before i pass out.  night all and hydrocodone is some good shiat."

"event","To missa:
Thank you for your comment.  i know i haven't been around much and i really want to see all of you again.  All of you are good people and great friends.  I have talked to sam and we figured out what lead to such a crappy V-day.  We both agreed somethings could have been done differently on both of our parts and she knows she was a big bitch and apologized a number of times.  I think it will take a while for things to get better but she needs to work out things with her mom first.  Her mom was very much pissed off about the whole thing.  Well your words mean a lot to me and i hope to see you soon.  
To mandalou:
You are a great girl and you deserve a great night out.  I will call you and set something up.  I hope you are free on friday night cause thats about the only time i am.  If not i will make time for you.  I think i am done with actual dating for a while though.  i have been hurt one too many times.  things never work out right for some reason.  I hope we have fun and we both need to find people who are worth our time and company.  We both deserve so much better than our past few relationships.  I can't wait to see you again and look forward to it very much.  
Now about Sam:
She can can be the worst person to be with at points but when she wants to be like today she can be a real angle.  im still pissed as hell at her but i did relize i could have done somethings differently.  We had a good talk today and relized that nothing was going on between her and Goof Ball.  That was in the past way before me.  He screwed her over before and she doesn't like him at all anymore.  She still thinks Margie was all over me as in the way of wanting in my pants.  i can't tell her the truth about what margie is up to(not with me but her ""boyfriend"" from pius) because it would put a bigger strain on their friendship.  i know she could use a friend right now and to make things worse would not help.  I hope me and sam will become friends again but it is gonna take time before i can even see her.  I know for sure we won't be together or even dating for a long time and i don't know if i will even want to.  im pretty sure i don't.  but on;y time will tell  how things work out.  She talked to her mom tonight but i havent got a call from her to talk about that.  i hope she doesn't move to her dads.  i don't want to lose her as a friend too.  I wish she calls me before making that choice because i think i can convince her to stay.  she has a lot of stuff here she would not want to leave behind.  i hope she relizes that.  not just me but friends and her moms family.  they all have nice things to say about her besides when she acts all two faced and what not.  I forgot to ask her about her dad from the play but if we talk tomarrow i will.  
Well thats enough for tonight.  night all and credit cards should be for emegancies only."

"event","I bowled like crap today.  i felt like crap today.  i was better than yesturday but i was still upset.  im still upset.
After bowling i went with jody larry and his fiance tara to the bowl to play pool.   From there me and jody went to margie's and sam's play of Our Town.  Boring play but decent acting.  After the play was over most of sam's friends came up to me to see how i was doing and to give me a hug and encouraging words.  I talked to Jeff dude who was cool and then sam came up and gave me a hug and ask if i was ok.  i told her i was better than yesturday but not really ok.  She then had to talk to her family but said shed be back.  i didnt really ""talk"" to her but i asked her about someone calling her mom.  she seemed upset about it and apperantly they are having a talk tonight about the whole thing.  The big shock came when Sam's dad of all people came up to us as we were sitting there and asked for me.  i said me sir hi how are you doing.  he said fine then asked if Ron was here too.  we said no and he turned waited then walked away.  i was frightened to say the least.  Her mom came up later and seemed distressed and asked if i was ok and gave me a hug and kiss on the cheek.  shes a good lady and i have a lot of respect and care for her.  she didn't say much but made sure i was fine and went back to her relitives.  I got word from patricia that sam was in deep shit with her mom about the whole thing and she was probably not going to get out of it in any way.  
i guess they were going to 54th street to eat but i wasnt about to go.  i told her good bye and they all left.  margie wasnt going so me and jody talked to her for a bit.  i told her thanks for last night and that she pretty much kept me out of hand cuffs.  after me and jody left we went to adrians again and bs'ed for a while.  towards the end i got a text from sam.  it said ""hey i love you""  that was nice to know but it sure didnt seem that way last night.  i wish she felt that way then so i wouldnt be going through this.  i texted her back saying that it didnt seem that way and and that she hurt me and that i went to get atleast a little of what we had back.  than i relized the way i put it was in a very mean demeaner so i sent another apologizing and said that i am still upset and im not sure if i could believe that.  i also told her i still cared about her and wished that last night went alot better than it did.  i set those around 1130 and i havent got anything back so she probably is sleeping or just doesn't want to talk now.  
i dont know how i feel right now but i know i still care for her i just dont know if i can trust her.  i want to but it will take alot more than a text massage.  
oh well time will heal all wounds right.  we'll see about that but for now its baby steps.  I have many questions to be answered so until that happens i will just relaxe and seek comfort from friends and just get my life going again.  

well enough of my sob story im sure im being a downer.  night all and many safe returns.

Wait a bit interesting side note.  i just got a call from sam.  i called her out on a couple things.  she wasn't drunk on friday but some guy was hitting on her and she denied him i guess.  Jeff told me today that she said she broke up with me to see about her and ron.  she side stepped it and countered with i wouldnt believe anything jeff said.  then i asked about something jeff said last night about ron screwing her over before.  she countered againg with fine believe him, who u just met or me, who youve known for over a year.  then she said she didn't want to argue now cause she's tired and asked me to call her tomarrow.  i will and i will get the facts straight one way or another.  i wont rest until i get all the info i can and find out why she was acting that way.

ok now im done sorry for the length again."

"event","i was half way through and relized it was getting long so please bear with me i need to get it all out.  And i hope your valentines day was a lot better than mine.
Tonight was the very worst valentines day ever for anyone in the world.  i would not wish this on my worst enemy!
I went in with all hopes of regaining something of what we had.  I came out with a bruised knuckle and an extreme case of the anger shakes!
It started half way decent.  i went to her house around 530.  her friends arived a little after me.  we took pics and headed out.  went to one of their houses.  she got out and rode with one of her friends to another friends house to pick her up.  some goof ball who i wanted to literally kill (LITERALLY) by the end of the night, rode with me there.  he got out and that girl we picked up rode with me.  What The Hell Was That.  she didn't even ride with me but once the entire night.  got to Buca De Beppo's and ate dinner.  Very Little Dinner Talk.  
The Dinner Talk
some how they got on the subject of a party they went to last night.  Apperently sam was tipsy and let a couple guys rub up on her.  i bit my lip and sat there trying to keep my head.  She noticed i was looking pissed but only asked twice if i was alright.  i didnt want to talk there and i was hoping she would ride with me atleast to the dance.  NOPE!  i rode with Goof Ball.  
That Ride
i got them blacks and then headed to the dance.  He asked what was up with me and sam.  i told him i didnt know.  he asked if i wanted to get back with her.  i shrugged and then decided i would like to get back with her.  but the way she was acting i wasnt for sure.  i guess he took that as a no i don't want her back.
The Dance
we went in and a couple times she acknoleged me as her date and i was starting to think she might want to atleast talk about things later.  we took pics there and went into the dancing area.  we sat down for a bit and then sam took off to talk to friends.  i danced with one of hers and was starting to enjoy myself a little.  then i sat down and waited for sam to come back.  30 min late she does only to say whats up and then danced with her friends.  i did another slow song with another one of her friends.  sat down again and tried to look for sam.  I saw her.  became enraged.  and got up to leave.  but i had someones stuff in my car.  looked for her and asked her to grab her stuff.  then jodys girl Margie stopped me.  Margie has a newly gain amount of respect from me.  she became one of the nicest person that night.  she made me dance with her.  i said i don't want to be near sam at all and i dont want to see them.  she was perfect.  she kept me facing away and even when i tried she stopped me.  
What got me so pissed is that she was freak dancing with Goof Ball.  Even knowing that i was already pissed and knowing that she could have talked to me about it.  Atleast i put forth an effort to regain some of our relationship back.  All she did was play stupid ass girl games with me and pissed me off even more.  Then Goof Ball came up to me when margie had her back turned talking to some one.  He said and i will use dialog for this:
GB: What are u not havin any fun?
ME: (evil eye and down right mean demeaner) NO... Im not havin fun!
Margie: (grabs my hand and pulls really hard) Charley, NO!
GB: (frightened look but still forward) Oh come on and shake it. (walk away before i put a foot in his ass)
what finnally got me to leave was i saw her and Goof Ball walking off holding hands.  its one thing to do it behind my back but when im there for a reason that she knows about is something in its own.  i pushed margie off of me and grabbed angelica and told her to grab her crap.  she looked scared and i appologized to her and said im outy and she needs to get her stuff before i go off on someone.  i didnt even say good bye to sam i just left before i did or said something i regrete.
i said my goodbyes and appologized for being a downer but i was pissed off and it was best i leave now.  after walking angelica and christen back to the door i walked past a hadi sign and punched it as hard as i could.  then i tore out of puis' parking lot fished tailed on some ice and peeled out as fast as i could.  
I called jody on his way back from the Comet's soccer game.  he said he would be back soon and to remain calm until he called me back.  i went to his neighbors and long time friend adrien's house.  i told him everything and told him how pissed i was and told him how hurt i was and then he told me that means im on the market again.  He is a very good friend and i wouldnt know anybody else who could have calmed me down as fast as he did.  i talked with them until 300Am then went home a lot happier.  those two could cheer anybody up.  
the funny thing is margie went off on sam and really told her off yelling and all.  i thanked her and told her that means a lot to me.  sam called me twice once to yell and after margie yelled at her to apologize.  she got brownie points for building up the courage to call me again to apologize but i am still pissed and i have to bowl tomarrow or today at 100.  i think jody is talking me to their play tom er today at 700.  i hope sam tries to talk to me.  ill tell her how i really feel and felt and how much it hurt me that she did that to me.  all her friends agreed that she was being a bitch and i deserved better.  which i do and i think im done with high school chicks.  
ive ranted enough for now.  ill have a follow up tom er later today.  It will take time but im ready for something new.  someone new. anything new.  Any suggestions help me out.  i need more than just jody right now.  
Well night all and hope everyone got something out of this.  sorry again that it was so long."

"event","To day i woke up, got the hair cut and good thing too.  it was starting to look like the serial killer do.  then i went to the mall to shop for sam's v day present.  i was going to get her like a glass heart or something of the ornamental type thing.  however, after recent events i spent a total of $7 on her.  the way she has been isnt worth $40 for this nice little desk top type glass heart thing i saw.  
I went to the bowl tonight to play pool with jody.  his girl is now seeing someone else and i got wind of what sam has been up to.  I thought her and jody's girl got into it about something and wernt talking any more.  aperantly not and they were together lastnight.  she called me tonight and left a message on my phone.  she said this is your least favorite person just wanted to talk cause we havent in a while so call me if you get home early enough.  i called her and told her v mail that she wasn't my least favorite person and i don't know were she got that idea from im just not happy with you right now.  
i hope i get an idea of whats going on this saturday so i can figure out if im on the market or to sit tight and wait for her to come back to me.  i really like her and i hope she stays a good friend if she breaks it off.  but outlook isnt very bright right now.  
oh yeah i got her a little teddy holding a small box of chocolates.  its kinda cute i dont know if i want to keep it my self or give it to her.
i also have city bowling tournament this weekend.  i hope i do good.  i also found out that it might be too late to turn in my state bowling tourn form.  i will have to call the guy running it to see if he cant get us in.  me and kevin run house last year taking third in doubles.  our team took second due to a late entry rolling highly over their average and getting more handicap than us.  i hope we do good this year.  
but it wont be the same without good ol KP.  we might bowl on the 17th and 18th which is the weekend after his accident.  It will be sad to bowl with out him this year.  
Well i have rambled long enough so night all and as a side note, the presidents of the united states of america are getting back together and are coming out witha new CD.  I am totally stoked for it."

"event","My life went from somewhat stable to crappy to worse.  Things were going fine and everything until Samantha freaks on me.  she didnt get mad but she is all of a sudden weird.  She decided things were going too fast for her and took us back to DATING.  i thought she was a little bit more mature than that but i was wrong.  im still taking her to her dance and were going to eat and everything.  I think shes close to breaking the whole damn thing off.  
It all started after we did the deed when we had a time to our self.  she was a tipical unexperianced girly about it and made me do all the work which i don't mind but she wined about how fast and slow i was going and tried to make me hurry cause it was hurting.  I took it as gentally as i could.  she said she enjoyed it but about a week later was when she started acting funny.  her play is coming up and we havent spoken much and im worried about losing her all together even as a friend.
her mom talked to me on sunday and asked if everything was ok.  i said yes even knowing that i wasnt fine.  she figured that sam did something and asked if we were ok.  i told her that sam wanted to take a step back to dating.  she said she thought something happened cause sam went out with her friends intead of me on friday.  and they went out again on saturday.  I think she might be looking for someone to replace me.  I would never tell a girl we need to take a step back and then go shopping for girls with my friends.  If she does that to me i will be totally pissed off and all i can do is piss and moan and bitch and curse and whatever else until i feel better about what happened.  
ive kinda had this happen before.  my girl went to a couple parties and ended up making out with someone else cause she was drunk.  she turned out well though.  shes getting married to some thirty year old and might be pregnant.
From now on i am not treating any girl with kind hearted devotion and respect.  everytime you think you have girls figured out they change the rules.  if your nice and sensitive they want a rough and mean guy.  if you acted that way the cry that youre not being sensitive to their emotions.  girls are too complicated and not worth the time and effort i have put in on them.  now ill let the girl do all the work.  any girls out there i am now letting you pamper me, buy me things, take me out, sweep me off my feet, try to get me in the sack, tend to my every need.  and you better be nice and sensitive.  no wait i changed my mind you need to be rough with me ignore me every now and then.  no be sensitive. rough. now sensitive. now jump though the hoop.  role over.  play dead.  beg for me. 
why dont girls relize what they have.  about two weeks ago if i would have broke it off with her she probably would have cried.  she loved and cared for me and now she thinks things are going to fast.  
other than that things are going well.  i got back into smoking cause of all this.  work is pretty much the same.  tuesday nights have picked up and i see chris dyke and derek malone there every week.  amis hasnt been back. and i have yet to get my raise despite complaining numerous times to martha.  jessie took off mondays so i have to work with the bitch.  my health is good so i think thats something to be greatful for.
oh well good night all and may your relationships do better than mine."

AMIS came with friends of his and bowled.  it was kinda funny to watch.  i dont know if you guys remember amis from school but i do and he bowls that quarter deal we have.  fun stuff.  hes going back to maple woods so u all might see him there.

I hung out with jody and adrian tonight and still took off too soon for them even though it was like almost two.  i talked to sam a little today and her ferensics thingy took too long for us to do anything.  she didnt place but did rather well. we havent done much latly and both off us feel that we should spend more time together.  we plan on making plans to take off to somewhere and just get away from it all.  we might go visit her dad and hang out down there.  
i miss the way things were.  life was better for everybody a few years ago.  economy was up and people left alot more things alone.  now we have peta or whatever the animal rights people are blowing up at anyone even looking at an animal wrong.  companies cant fire crack addicts because that is the same as killing them or something. plus i could still get away with a lot of the things i have been messing up on.  it not that i dont know that im messing up i just cant seem to do something about it.  i let the time slip away and didnt sign up for school so now i wont be on mom health insurance any more and if i get on at works i will lose alot more of my pay check.  i cant afford that shit and i cant afford to screw up anything at work either.  my manager outside is trying to get me a promotion to shift manager for outside when it opens up again and they threw the fact that i got caught letting friends play pool for free.  they had just started and i timed them on when the manager got back there.  The bitch just hates me and wont give me a break if my life depended on it.  shell just say well he had it coming or something equally as mean.

I got my City tournament (bowling) shtuff turned in the other day and im getting money from josh and larry as soon as they get it.  
oh yeah, as a side note larry bought his girl an engagment ring!  bachelor party anyone!  and they all said i would be the first to get married.  what a load of crap  though.  not to be mean or anything but anytime he says hi to any girl she flips and breaks up with him. i cant wait to see how this turns out.
i still need to get my state (bowling) stuff done then we will be set.  i played pool tonight and suck ass like usual.  sam went with some friends to the movies so i got away with hanging out for a while.  i then met her and her friends at denny's and had a snack.  then took her home and made out in her drive way before leaving.  i never believed it until now but she smokes blacks and she had me buy her some tonight.  freaked me out a bit but now she cant say anything when i smoke.  
i might see her after her ferinsics tournament.  that is if she doesnt go to finals.  part of me wants her to cause she enjoys that stuff, then another part wants her to fail so we can hang out longer.  either way i might get to see her so whatever happens.
its funny cause tonight her friends all stood up for me when sam got all pushy and mean to me.  i laughed and followed their lead.  then i relized i dont stand up for myself agianst her anyother time.  made me relize that she is mean to me alot.  i dont mind it iguess cause my sister was like that every time i talked to her so stuff slides too far off my back for me to relize that im being walked all over.  but any other time is like spending time with an angel and she knows my turn offs and turn ons and she understands me so well i can let the little things go.
guess we have some things to work out before we take the big step.  ha like it will happen soon. if ever.  shes ok though i love her and her piddaly little bouts of meanness dont bother me. much anyways.  itell her when she makes me upset or when she goes too far.  then she apologizes and makes up for it.
well i have rambled on long enough time for night night if i get to sleep tonight.  night all and never underestimate the power of the art of butt wip"

I wasnt going to sit around and wait for her to call.  i know i should be all ""ill make everything ok""  and help her get through it but she wasn't getting home until about the time i was gonna get home. maybe about 30 min after she gets home but thats not that long to wait.
i got her call at the bowl and talk to her in between turns for a bit until she got pissy and said she was going to bed and not to bother calling.  i got her calmed down before getting off and called her when i got home.  she calmed down and hopefully i can talk to her more tomorrow.  we might go out then cause she doesn't have school fri but she has something else to do.  
I also have some funny info on bitch at work.  aparently she is inline for a raise but scince the revanue for the bowl isnt up to par she might not get it and if she doesnt she cant work there any more.  what a bit of unfortionate info for her.  now i might be able to screw her over like she has been screwing me over.  lets see how she likes it when the shoe is on the other foot.  she doesnt deserve the raise anyhow.  what good has she done for the bowling alley.  she scared off several employees and doesn't handle confruntation very well esspesially with the costomers.  i say peace out biatch.

today i also had to porter(clean up trash).  our porter was sick and nobody else wants to do the grunt work.  but to prove that i can handle difficult situations i took the job along with yesturdays snack bar duty.  i also handled the counter by my self through a rough patch rather nicely.  If only our center manager was still there.  i forgot to ask her bout my review and i remembered ten min after she left. damn the luck.  theres always tomarrow but it better get to  me some how.  
And jack ass better not get my shift manager duty when outside opens.  he seems to think hes a shoe in for the job.  i heard diff from the real outside manager.  i also better get a larger raise with that.  fuck management and the ass holes who think they are management.  their power trippin asses better relize the little people are who get the jobs done.  the way bitch steps all over her workers are the reason this bowling alley is going to shit.  most of the people who have quit are because of her and nobody gives a shit that this woman has no people skills whatso over.

i hope you guys can forgive me for not coming back for now but it doesn't seem that i can get my head out of my (I).  
Bitch at work ragged on me sat and told me she wasn't taking anymore of anyones crap.  instead shes firing on the spot and hiring new people.  i haven't seen anyone new and she doesn't even have the athority to fire people.  i told her i might have to take a sat class and she told me i was lying cause no schools have sat classes.  then even though i told her that was the only time i could take it she called me a liar and asked why i didn't take it during the week.  I SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT SATURDAY WAS THE ONLY TIME I COULD TAKE IT!  she hears what she want's and i almost quit right there.  Plus now here lap dog is doing most of her work for her.  little pussy eater!  lap dog is already going to be a center manager in a year and i feel sorry for whatever center gets this fool.  
He told me i had to tuck in my shirt so i tucked in the front and left the back out to see what he would do.  next time he came in he yelled, actually spoke in a louder tone, to tuck in my shirt.  i said it is and went back to helping the customers.  he sculted off and pissed and moaned like a good little lap dog.  
sorry for the rant im not feeling well and today was a little better but i still want to hurt some one. i just have a little more to talk about so bear with me.
i got to work with the hotty Jessie in the morning cause jackass's moms went to the sucky ass chiefs game.  if we would have won i could have worked with jessie again.  damn chiefs they hate me.  i saw my girl last night for a brief bit and didnt even get a kiss from her.  but i got one today that made up for it.  plus donna was in a cherry mode so that made the second half go by rather fast.

Bitch ass didnt give me my review to sign and see was gonna look into it.  we didnt have as much business tonight as before but it was more than before the holidays.  i got off fairly early and called sam when i got home.  im gonna pick her up after she gets back from werrensburg for a school thing.  that is gonna be around midnight she said but im gonna be out anyways so i dont care.  
thanks to missalissa and mandalou for your support and i hope to see you both soon.  i went to metro link and then relized i couldn't find my ID thingy so i couldnt go into it.  so i guess i have to make a trip up to school or search long and hard for that damn thing.  
i also found out that this fri and sat in the game room is gonna be rough cause of a new rate thing we have for the pool tabels.  they are charging per person $8 for a two hour session.  there will be two sessions at like 930 to 1130 and 1130 to 130.  that is gonna be a pain explaining to people.  but its their oun fault for fighting and this might cut back on that shit.

I haven't signed up for school and i flunked math and econ last sem.
i have to retake both and chem the real thing.  i also need to find out what the hell is up with my raise.  i havelittle money and not a clue where it goes.  I have tried to wuit smoking but it is not working.  too many stresses have drove me bake to it.  New years i felt like a damn fool cause i got way too drunk and thought i would be cool and call my girl.  STUPID!  
I wrote her a couple poems and it made her feel better about me and that made me happy.  for a while.  something brought up my boy Kevin P. amd it made me depressed.  I don't know why im not over that but it still bothers me.  I hope Rick at the bowl gets that tournament together.  i want to bowl that before i go adult.  maybe it should be an adult youth thing.  that would be nice.  but it is going to be for scholorship money he said.  
I cant sleep either and i think i might have sleep depravasion.  When i try to sleep i wake up in an hour or two.  then i try to go bake to sleep and end up playing vigee games.  I still need to finish my room but that might have to wait until i get my life on track again.  
im looking for support this next sem and hope most of my friends are still there.  i need to stay on track go to class all the time and do my homework.  ive even thought about quiting work so i can focus better on school and screw the bowl in the long run.  the need me more than they know.  
on a side note saturday was fucked up in the game room.  A fight broke out between a group of asians.  some kid got fucked up by a pool stick and was bleeding profusly.  i had to break it up and call 911.  then i got wuestioned and i might have to ID a couple of them.  i can't tell any of those people apart they all look the same.  
well now that i have got a few things off my chest i think im gonna try to check out the school web site then go to sleep if i can.  night all and good luck on lifes crazy journy."

Crappy week and new years was a pain in the ass.  I went to my friend larry's family deal and got piss drunk.  i spent the count down in the bathroom and with my head out the window on the ride home.  fun stuff.  i even found the time to call my girl from the floor of the bathroom and act like a damn idoit.  i never understand why i do these things but i do.  maybe this will be my last year.  
I don't even care what happened after that i just know today i felt like shit and didn't even call Sam until after i got up for the second time.  i got home around 1030 and went back to bed.  I called her later and she didn't make me feel much better.  She was worried that i was gonna do something last night like cheat on her.  there was only one girl i wound even consider doing that with and she wasnt there.  all i had to choose from was a skank and a slut.  both i probaly would have caught something.  
I went to the bowl with jutt and shot pool with him until jody and shavers got there.  then we all played and i ended up getting my ass kicked all around.  i didn't win but once against jutt.  
i didnt call sam when i got home neither and i hope she doesn't get mad and not want me to come over tomorrow.  i finally saw her again when she got home the 31st.  i gave her a big hug when i saw her and she got emotional and stuff.  i missed her so much.  we are gonna see a movie tomorrow.  should be fun.  she keeps telling me she wants to do me and we are never alone for a long enough time and it makes her mad.  she told me that it might be a good thing we have to wait.  it will be better for our relationship.  i think shes right but im ancy and want her in a bad way.  BAD.  oh well i have to wait and it will be better like wine or something.  right? the longer i wait the better it will be like aged wine.

Me and sam exchanged gifts.  she knows me so well.  i loved what she got me.  I got some curve cologne(i think thats how its spelled); a cuddally teddy bear; and a shirt that says ""grab your balls...we're going bowling!""  and it has a bowling pin standing up and two bowling balls setting at the base of it like a well you know. a PENIS. its quite funny and my co=workers liked it when i showed it off tonight.  
She loved the gift that i got her.  she liked the teddy bear and i saw her face when she only saw the teddy.  she was lmost dissapointed.  until she pulled it out and saw the bag hanging on his arm.  then her eyes got real big and nearly yanked off the bear's arm trying to get it off.  when she opened it and saw the charm she smiled real big and nearly jumped on me to give me a hug and kiss.
Her little bros were cute except the baby cried nearly the entire time.  Ricky the older one was funny and i wrestled around with him for a bit until sam said she was jelouse.  she also called me a big kid. and said i had the mind of a 3 year old.  called me retarded and whatever else cause i was having fun with her brother.  oh well she got hers later.

"event","I had a rough few days.  sorry for leaving u all for a bit and i bet you are all excited to hear whats been going on.  thursday was more shopping.  I bought My sis' boyfriend(Bro-in-law) a gift and endulged my need to spend on myself.  friday i hung out with my girl, jody and some of my girl's friends.  saturday i bowled and went to the movies with my girl and her friend.  i lied to get out of work.  today was work all day and partially into my employee x-mas party. 
I saw stuck on you with matt damon and that one guy.  it was decent better thatn i thought yet not a good as expected.  wierd i know.
seeing how i might not see my girl until after x-mas i took her present over on friday and showed her mom.  i told her i had to see her open it if i can.  i also asked her mom to keep her out of it until then.  lets see how long that last.  she likes to peek at her presents and already knows everything her mom got her.  i asked her very serously not to open it until i had a chance to see her again at her house.  i still dont have a clue if shes gonna get me something good or lame.  the way its sounding it might be lame but if its from the heart ill love it anyway.  she asked me what size shirt i wear.  if its a t shirt im taking my gift back.  unless its something corvette.  then ill do her right there.  
i think it might be an MU jersey or something MU which is fine with me but id rather have something corvette. if i even figure how to get these pics on this web site ill show you peps how much i love corvettes.
well i think ill go and play my new computer gams and then go to sleep. Night all and good luck.  I dont know."

"event","well i got some of my x-mas shopping done with.  i got samantha a necklace like mine kinda but prettier and a charm shaped like an S with the white gold in the mid section.  i got a bear to go with it and i put the necklace in a bag and put that on the bears arm and put the bear in a bag.  she'll love it.  
i also got my sis a $70 clock for her apartment and a gift for one of my cosins for our little party on x-mas.  that was about it.  i looked for stuff to buy myself but i didnt really feel like spending anymore money which is surprising for me cause money burns holes in my pockets and leap out like i have a bad disease.  
i didnt talk to sam too much but what i did i enjoyed i met her at the mall earlier and we were supposed to find a gift for her mom.  then she started looking for a sweetheart dress and took me in the dressing room with her. it was kinda disappointing cause she didnt even show me anything.  i can respect that but there was no point for me to be in there if that was all she was doing.  oh well it was still hot.  then she left with her friends and i went to a jewlery shop and found what i wanted and had them hold onto it for me.  
well that was one exciting day.  im pooped so im going to sleep. night all and dream about me."

Engineering was a breese and wish the other two were like that.  i have to wait and see how i really did though.  
when i got home i called my girl and we talked for a bit.  shes going to the mall tomarrow with friends of hers and im thinking if i should go up there and hang with her for a bit or wait to go with mums like i said i would.  maybe i could go for a bit come back and go to the bank and pick up mums and go back.  that could work if  you followed that.  
I finally get to go christmas shopping.  i can only do so much though cause the rest is for mums and she doesnt want to be there when i buy her present even though she already knows what it is.  
I had another coughing fit at work and it sucked cause i was at the counter with absolutly nobody around me.  thats right another night of quarter mania were nobody came.  oh well not my problem.  as long as i get paid.

i didnt even say how i bowled yesturday so here i go.  shitttttttty. well for 11:00 cause i got there at 11:00.  i had little practice and wasnt very warm.  however i made up for 9:00 after that.  i shot a 199 average but it didnt feel like it.  i had a low 200, 196, 162, and 233 which boosted my ave.  by the way my average went up to 197 for that week and will be the same for next week.  
today went fine and i bowled a 623 for practice.  work was bland and i didnt have a coughing fit which is good.  i didnt shop today and i wont have a chance tomarrow so im going with mums on wen.  I will get most of it done at the mall and just get gift cards for Best Buy or something.

"event","yesturday was ""FUN STUFF!!!"" I had to  work with bitch and new guy at the counter.  Jackass shows u p to work the counter and he wasn't supposed to so rather than sending him home bitch got the idea to bring me up to the counter to help with the ""RUSH""(very small amount) of people coming in for open play.  i didnt even get a chance to call my girl.  she did send me home early though. TWO FLIPIN MINUTES EARLY! i was pissed.
Today was better.  i started losing my voice around 5:00 and ask phillip to work the counter for me and i could work the game room.  he agreed and so did donna.  i had two motives for this.  i couldnt talk well and my girl showed up.  i got to talk and torture my girl cause she started it with putting ice down my shirt and my friend's another friend got her on the ground flipped her on her back held up her legs and i dropped ice down her pants.  we all had a big laugh. 
after she left i played a couple games of pool with jody and his ""sis"" adrean.  i came out even.  after they left i was bored out of my mind and sat around coughing.  i had a big coughing fit and it made my eyes water like i was cryingi had to go into the bathroom and fill up my bottle of water about four time before it stopped.  i then had a massive head ache and sore throat donna let me go at 9:40 almost right after i got out of the gameroom.  
by the way branson is definatly called off and i slipped again with the love thing but i belive i ment it this time.  i didnt even recoil after saying it, like it was natural or something.  surprised me cause it usually takes me a while like two ta three months not one like this.  besides she said it back with a big smile that made me happy.  
i think im gonna go xmas shopping tomarrow during the day and hopefully get most done.

the only way to go in my mind.  and damn i was rich.  but i think more people would show up.

i woke up feeling worse than i ever have since getting sick.  i took a shower and felt ten times better and i felt better as the day went on.  i developed a head ache but that was about it.
Later on i went to Tortilla Flats with samantha and her friend and her friends boyfriend.  we then went to maggie moos and had ice cream and went our seperate ways.  Both places had people i knew from tonka.  Elana calc and tera dale at TF and ashely j at MM.  it was a little wierd for some reason cause i didnt even realize who they were at first.  It was good to see ashely again i missed her. but i didnt really care too much for the other two in high school.  elana seemed cool tonight but she wasnt in high school.  oh well i got to see my girl and it was fun.
i didnt get to talk to her about branson but things arent looking good.  i wish i could go but she leaves on christmas and her dad said 6 days(if i went then) was too long.  i then asked her if i could come later like planned but she told me i would get lost and not know what to do.  i scolded her and pouted.  she then said she would talk to her dad and think about it.  i was happy.  i hope i get to go down there but she keeps saying i wont get to see her until like jan 9th or something.  im mad and feel like kidnapping her just so i could see her before then.  oh well its outa my hands and atleast i will see her after this all blows over.
night all and a safe tomarrow."

"event","This morning i was waken up by mom telling me that my sis was taking the taurus and i had to take her to work.  well i was half asleep and didn't comprehend the fact that all my stuff was in the taurus and it was too late to call jacque (jackie) back home.  Mom decided to start the tempo and the crown vic.  she took the tempo and i got the vic.  i pushed her out of the parking spot and sent her on her way.  then i realized i couldnt get out of my spot.  i rocked back and forth until i finally got out about 15 min later.  
i got to school hella late and had a math test.  we are doing logrythims and i didnt have a calculator.  i pooped on the test.  Econ was a bunch of rambles about nothing and i got maybe 1/4 of a page of notes.  during that class i started feeling bad and light headed but shook it off until about 1 when mandy needed a ride home.  i talked to a kid in my engineering class and asked him to tell the teach i was going home sick.  i then gave mandy a ride home and went home my self.  
well mom was there and asked about me being home so early and i explained.  the she left in the vic and went the back way to work.  about 5 min later she comes back in and says he hit a light pole.  the back way never gets salted and it was still slick.  with a powerful V8 and rear wheel drive it makes it hard not to spin the tires.  she was going around 10mph and started to speed up when the tires started going.  the back end went to the drivers side and she counter steered.  however the front tires were on ice now and didnt grab.  the back tires still going pushed her on the curb and slide right into a light pole.  she was pissed and called gramps cause it is his car.  he understood and shook it off as nothing big cause his insurance will cover it.
later i went to the bowl with jody and shot some pool.  he is pissed about something really jacked up with something going on with his girl and her fam.  he slammed his car door so hard it shattered the window.  i totally understood.  but our other friend acts like everything should be catered to him.  he wanted jody to calm down and when he didn't our friend got mad and theatened jody with bodily harm.  i dont understand him.  oh well.
oh yeah the exciting conclusion to the love or wuv thing.  she understood that i wasnt feeling well and it slipped but i told her something like my subconsiance(however it is spelled) made me do it.  then she took it like im going to acctually say it in a week or two.  i like her alot and want to be sure about it before i say it again.  i dont want to hurt her if i dont mean it.  i also dont get to see her for a while and branson is called off for now.  our obligations are reaking havock on our relationship along with jody's girl's problems.  i have to work and she has school and drama stuff and we never have time enough for each other and i really wanted to see her this week but i might not be able to.  we'll see what happens tomarrow and hopefully i do get the chance to see her.
i have more as details arise. thats all for now here at The Mac's House. Back to you Bob."

So it finally snows and im sick so i cant play in it or nothing the only thing i did was push moms out of the parking spot.  fun stuff as i step in a big slush puddle and get my socks wet that i just put on.  i hate winter.  i wish it would snow in the summer time without the cold.  then i would be the happiest little boy in the whole world.  
i didnt have any classes today but i do tomarrow and i hope there are a few slick spots were i can play on my way to school.  im feeling better but now i have a cough and it makes my head hurt.  however, i had one cig last night and none today and i feel fine for the most part.  i think my withdrawl is covered up by my sickness.  thats the new way to quit.  start when your sick so you wont know if you are craving or just sick.  it works.  in theory.  right. whatever.
my girl asked me to send her a sweet text for a good night thing or something.  well i wrote it and sent it and then looked at it and realized i wrote love instead of wuv.  i didnt even realize when i was writing it.  wuv was our way of saying it without really saying it.  i think i messed up but i wont know until tomarrow.  i freaked myself out and i dont know if i meant it or if it just came out.
come back tomarrow for the exciting conclusion.  night all eat drink and dont dirve when drunk."

She is dealing with her sickness alot better than me by eating and drinking healthy while i drink pop and eat cookies and french fries.  i just hope i get better before the trip to branson with samantha.  that way i wont feel so tired and drained.
I didn't get my check today so i think i will go up there either tomarrow or thursday so i have money for christmas preasents and what not.  i really hope my back pay gets here before christmas.  
now i am heading to bed and hopefully i will get a full nights sleep instead of waking up every hour on the hour.  night all and a better tomarrow."

My girl is so sweet to me now that i am sick and i think i will use this info to my advantage.  make her be all lovy dovy to me and then surprise her on like christmas or our trip to branson.  something sweet to sweep her off her feet for taking such good care of me in my time of ""need.""  I still have to get her present and everyone elses and the way things are going i wont be able to until the day before.  i think my bank account will be tapped by the end of the season.  thats no good cause of branson and i think my family is going to florida soon.  everything is going to be fine cause i will make it fine or be very upset.

"event","I had to go into work early.  of course i had to wake up earlier than i wanted and went into work early cause i got sick of doing nothing.  i got there about 9:45 (15 min early) and found out why they wanted me to come in early.  We had an adult/youth tourn. and there was massive amounts of people there.  The ""biggest"" shocker of them all i was alone at the counter most of the time.  The best part when i was swamped at one point my co worker was standing right by the counter watching the crappy chiefs game and did't bother to help me in any way.  no no i take that back she told me that we just tied the game.  Glad you are enjoying the game bitch.  the twist of the knife is that i am coming down with something and i felt like shit the entire night.  i was even grumpy to Samantha.  i felt bad and she started right away on me and i didn't feel like playing with her.  I did get a break which i spent in the game room with her and my buddy jody.  The only other break i got was earlier when my co worker came back during a calm period and i got something to eat then right back to work.  
One good thing is that sam saw that i wasn't felling well and backed off and started trying to make me feel better.  Her mom even noticed i wasn't feeling it and made sure i was fine before they left.  i love her mom even though sam hates me for it.  i also got off early and came home and literally plopped on the couch with a profounding wooof of the cusions.  i just laid there and mom asked if i wanted anything to eat and made me food.  she has the motherly instinct of when i am sick and babied me until she went to bed.

Well it was just the glass in front of it but close enough.  Then the fudge heads from the morning bowling leagues think ill let them do anything they want and kept trying to steal stuff from the display case.  I literally did the mom slap on some kid and it freaked him out.  I got him good too he had a welt and all.  he left me alone the rest of the night.  others took a little more and i was more than happy to releave so stress.  Then after i got off i had to talk to the district manager who was serving boose next door.  I dont get my pay check until tues and my review still isn't done.  I talked to both the DM and my other ""manager"" lady.  they both promised i would get both done by tues and hopefully i get my raise and back pay before x-mas.  then i had on of the better conversations with my girl and this time she didn't try to make me fell bad about something.  i think i might have her figured out and will have better conversations in the future.  
This morning kinda sucked but over all it was a good day.  I started off bad in both leagues.  9:00 i shot a 169, 236, 231, 219.  11:00 i shot a 152, 193, 258 for another 603 series.  i threw a bit of a fit after that first game and releave a lot of stress.  then i found my mark and left alot of solid ten pins and got pissed again.  then i calmed down and shot the 258.  
i also have to go in early tomarrow and mope around with nothing to do but piss and moan about being ther too damn early.  fun stuff?!  If i had another job lined up geranteed to hire me i would quit the bowl in a heart beat.  but i don't so i have to suck it up.  
moneys money and if i have more than u then i can buy more stuff than u or something.  I guess i don't have to out run the bear; i just have to out run you.  right ive always loved that saying cause it is so true and thats how i live my life.  for the most part. not really i just thought i would sound cool. oh well i can still out run you.  night!"

I was suppose to go shopping for my girl with a buddy of mine but he wasn't feeling well and didn't get up until the same time i did.  that would be around 3:00 or so.  When he did call me I had already made plans with my girl and was getting all sexied up for her.  By the way I was very sexy tonight.  
I called her around 5:00 to set things up and took a shower after that.  Then i waited around bored off my ass til around 7:00 to leave.  she made me see haunted mansion for ""some reason.""  We saw most of it during breaks and the few funny parts.  my professional review is crappy.  don't waste the money wait for the release on video.  dull not much humor for me or her.  i did like the singing bust and the gipsey head in the crystal ball.  that was it though.
I was at her house until 1:00 and came home.  we didn't even do that much there like we usually do.  oh well i am going to branson with her and we can have all sorts of fun there.
well thats all for now oh yeah i get to work all night again tomarrow that makes three weeks in a row.  oh well i can use the mulla.  good night sleep tight and if you have bugs call the exterminator."

Me and my girl are feeling each other more deeply than either of us really relize.  I sent her an email today and for some reason i got real sensitive and put down some feelings i had in my head.  They were good feelings but i wasn't sure if things were ready for them to come out like that.  how ever when i got hers back she seemed touched and even put a few things she was feeling.  and for some reason i wasn't freaked out at all.  I think it might be the fact that i have known her for well over a year and we have been friends for the entire time.  I know here alot better now and feel like ive known her longer than that.  I dont think im quite at the love level and she knows that and the cool thing is shes not pushing it on me.  I appriciate that dearly.  For some reason Im not running away screaming at the thought of loving some one but im not quite at that level, but im close.  we havent been going out that long but weve been into each other for the time before we started going out.  we always talked on the phone and went on a couple of dates but nothing seemed to go right for either of us during that time.  but now things are great and i cant wait to see were it all goes.

"event","This is the second day in a row i have felt like walking out on work.  Donna who is ussual pretty good at making sure im not at the counter by myself for a long amont of time had to leave for some type of emergency.  I can understand that but she was gone most of the time when she told me that it would only be at the most 2 hours.  I got all the leagues started myself and did all their money.  Then when she did get back i still wasnt able to get food because she had to finish up in the office.  I guess this is good over all.  Im learning to be more dependent on myself instead of others and getting better at problem solving.  Even that deal on sat. with the druggies i pretty much handled myself, even if it wasn't the best way possible.  even if it is helping me become a better worker there is no call for someone to be at the counter during the later leagues for a long time.  
Not to sound too egotistical but i think this senior chick from oak park has the hots for me.  She had her little sister tell me she was gonna be there tonight and made sure that she had a friend to show me off to.  that wasn't too egotistical was it. Oh well.
I also went to all my classes today and even took my time in engineering instead of rushing through the assignments.  I took good note in math but it is almost impossible to take note in econ because he gets off the subject so much i lose track after the first time.  we are also getting into the easier stuff for math that i remember something about.  After i get done with this im checking the web site for the rest of my math notes.  that is something i would have put off til tomarrow and forgotten about it.  I might even start work on my econ paper tonight cause i dont have class tomarrow.  
well it time to go study and what-not.  Live long and prosper."

"event","For starters i would like to apologize to one miss mandalou for standing her up today at school so she will be getting extra hugs and kisses from me tomarrow.  I am so very sorry and wish for all your mercy when you see me tomarrow which you might not get this yet but ill tell you about it.

Now for my crappy work day.  i got to work with the most unpopular ""manager"" lady.  She started off leaving me at the counter by my self from 30 min after i got there at 5 until around 830 to 845.  then i finally got a cig and food before she left me again til a couple min before i got off.  then she had me run checks and do the lottery report.  i got off at aroun 1015 15 min after i was supose to. not like i was leaving or anything cause i bowled after but its the principal.  I also bowled a 640 something.  not bad with my knee still feeling like shit.  ill ice it down again tonight.  she also said nothing to me about my raise and ignored me when i asked and i forgot later to ask again.  oh well ill get back pay and it better be before christmas cause im going to branson that follwing sat with my girl and her friend and mine who are together.  I have also promised moms to get her pergo flooring and finish my rooms so i need that money cause stuff today isn't cheap.  I think im also getting sick and nows not a good time.  i need to be at every class for math and econ so i can pick up my grades in there.  if not im gonna have to pay for all my classes.  thats might be around 700-1000 bucks.  not that i dont have it i just rather spend it on something else.  
I am not feeling so good any more.  I think its because i don't exercise enough and im out of shape.  I always felt good after a strong work out but now when i do anything that requires effort i get all bummed cause i fell very worn out after even small things.  Im gonna quit smoking and join that community senter in north town so i can get back in shape mabey more so than i was in my prime.  I might even check out some adult basketball leagues like the y or something.  i wonder if my cosin still plays in that league he was in.  ill have to find out.  no that i have written it down i better act on it so i dont get in a rut again.  the reason i brought this up is cause i ran down from the count the first set of lanes to get a pin out of the gutter and got very winded.  i didnt like that feelling one bit.  thats it i've made up my mind i am gonna quit smoking and start exercising more.  Period. final answer.  good for me.  mabey ill feel a little better than i have the past few months.  this is gonna be good for me.  alright now its time for sleep cause i want to be awake for class tomarrow. good night"

"event","My knee is very close to going out on me.  Working from 11-10 didn't help it two much.  when i got home it was swollen pretty bad and hurt like the dickens.  I think i should see a doctor because this has happened before but not as bad.  hopefully icing it down helps like it did last time.  and hopefully it is healed by the City and State tourtament for bowling.  
Speaking of which, i believe right now i am going to be in the top division for both is singles.  This 196 average is gonna suck.  I need to figure out what the rest of my team is doing so we can fill the papers out and send them in.  City is in Feburary and state is in march and april.  

My girl likes to toy with me.  I didn't get a chance to talk to her yesterday and i was hoping to see her today but she texted me and said she might not make it.  I was upset and was kinda mopping around when i saw her on my way to do something.  She said my face lit up then turned into something of evil.  I got mad and scoulded her for messing with me like that.  I think she has me hooked. why else would i have gotten mad for her not coming and lighting up when i did see her.  I don't know right now im too tired to think that serious.  
Im going to sleep off the pain of my knee and dream of a better tomarrow.  peace to all"

"event","Well i bowled another 600 series in 11 o'clock and held my average for 9.  All in all another good week of bowling.  But work pissed me off.  For starters, our main manager's sister died last week of cancer and our manager has been gone for a couple weeks(understandable).  Our other ""manager"" decides its ok to take vacation.  That left us short for the counter which i had to cover until about 1.  Im fine with the work but i would have really liked to have been in the game room tonight.  
A friend of mine had a table back there he was getting for free.  He went outside while some friends played and he saw a couple guys smoking a blunt.  after he got in and played a game those guys came in and played one with another kid on that table.  One of them decides it would be cool and take the tabacco out of a black and put it in a bagy, then put it back in the black.  This caught my friend's attention and being a protective big bro to his sis came and told me what was going on.  I Know almost all of the kids who play back there and really don't want that kind of shit going on around them.  I go back there and see whats going on.  I confront a kid i know from high school who was a big druggy.  He said they weren't smoking weed or nothing like that.  Then i asked jackass, who was working, what they were doing.  then that kid comes over and says he tells me what he did and that was it.  I told him there was no call for that.  Then i asked him what the point of taking out the tabacco and putting it back in was.  He got real shifty and evasive.  this made me very pissed.  i determined that there was something else in that bag that went back in withthe tabacco.  I got real protective of the little kids back there and scaulded him.  I told him these kids were like siblings to me and i didn't what that kind of sh1t around them and if i heard anything else of that nature i would literally throw them out myself.  thats when he backed down and said he wouldn't do anything else like that.  Thats when i realized i had someone holding me against the counter and telling me to calm down.  I was really pissed and caught a glimps of myself in a window and noticed the look of evil on my face.  If he pushed me any more i might of hurt him.  

If any of you have ever heard of taking tabacco out of a black then putting it back in and the point of it let me know cause i want to make sure those kids are safe to play in that game room without being introduced to something they should even know about yet.  
I hate those kids anyway and that would have been a good excuse to break a foot off in their ass.  Im still pissed about it and want them to try that sh1t when im back there.  It will be a whole other story.  plus i mad i didn't even get a chace to talk to samantha.  i know she wanted to talk to me but i was stuck at the counter the whole night.  oh well i should have some time tomarrow to call her.  
I am going to sleep now scine its 2 and i have to work at 11.  another long day ahead of me. good night or morning or whatever."

"event","I help my girlfrien and here mom put up some of their x mas decorations.  Fun stuff concidering it was like 20 degrees out.  I got there about eleven and helped the til dark then we ate and then me and Samantha played Super NES for awhile until she started sheating and we ""wrestled"" for a bit, she won.  The only problem is she wont do anything and wont let me do anything to her.  I don't mind waiting but she needs to stop turning me on then shooting me down.  At least when i turn her on i offer to finish her off.  she doesnt even offer.  i really like her and dont want to pull the i love you thing to get some. if i just wanted ass i could go for the horny 15y/o.  but i want to be with sam and ""be"" with her.  i dont think i can take anymore of the teasing.  Ok from now on when she goes to start im turning her down.  Then we'll see how long she can last with out me messing with her.  I know she wants me cause she tells me after every time we mess around, then says she has to be a good girl.  I like hard to get but damn.  I know it hasnt been that long but she cant like touch it and do nothing.  I should tell her that stuff doesn't fly too well with me.  im not selfish as i said before, at least when i touch her i offer to do the rest.  (Redundent but it makes me mad) 
Getting off the sexual subject.  Her mom is great.  She drives like a maniac and doesnt care what anyone says about it.  when we went to get the food she was all over the road and Sam yelled at her.  Her mom shruged and said nobody is coming so why should i leave all this road unused.  I busted up laughing and got yelled at by Sam.  She is mean to her mom and i dont like that.  I defend her mom all the time and get ridiculed for it.  Plus I only know my mom so that doesnt help matters much when Sam is mean to her's.  But it was funny today cause her unc was there again and me, unc and moms teamed up in clowning on Sam.  I took most of the heat cause i started it and agged it on.  We went for about ten min until she threw a pillow at her mom and stormed off.  she can dish it fine but when it gets turned around she goes ape shit.  I think its cute and tormented her about it through out the night.  She took it well or must have because it didn't effect the ""wrestling.""  
Oh yeah, Horny girl bout got my balls chopped off because she called twice while i was there.  Then sam kept trying to call her back and i kept hanging up on her.  then stupid ass calls back and sam answers and says im busy and mentions that she was my girlfriend and hangs up.  then i get twenty questions about her and played it off nicly.  Besides i don't like this girl and told her i had a girlfriend.  but she is trying her hardest to get me.  I hate that and was laughing the entire time sam was talking to her.  Hopfully she takes a hint and leaves me alone.  
Well i and a good turkey day and hopefully tomarrow wont be too busy for the game room.  and hopefully horny girl does show up.  I want everyone to finish out the holiday weekend safely and have fun. Peace."

"event","This had to be one of the better holidays for my family.  Most of my family is mad at gramps for getting remarried and he shows up with his new wife.  to my surprise nobody jumps on his ass for it.  They were even ""nicer"" to his wife.  I dislike my family because every time something happens it is blown out of proportion and taken to extrems.  I spent most of the time talking to the cosins who don't care about what gramps is doing.  My cos pete is the best but he is going to k-state and is never around anymore.  Bo is next but he lives in st. joe and his bro paul lives in maryville.  mary an annie come after them and they live in smithville but they arn't into the same stuff i am so we don't hang out much.  Eric is out there but pretty cool for the most part.  steven and rochell are the worst cause they are stuck up for no reason.  as a matter of fact they weren't even there today.  They don't care to much to see gramps.  I think they all could be nicer to him for the fact that he is showing signs of alshimer or how ever its spelled.  My 2nd cosins were there and the older one is kinda queer.  Which theres nothing wrong with that he just came off that why for the first time that ive noticed.  Dallas is a senior this year and he let his hair grow out which doesn't really work to well for him or thats what his big bro matt said.  over all i had a good time and would take this one over any of the others.  Too much alcohol and such at the others turned them into a free for all.  
well i haven't talked to my girl besides a text so im going to call her now and happy turkey day to all."

"event","I got nothing done today.  Pick my girl up and took her home.  her unc was there for mabey ten min and left us by ourselves.  Cool guy but not to bright.  we didn't do nothing but she wanted to. she was being good though.  didn't mean she couldn't give me the worse case of blue balls know to man. All she did was suck my fingers and lick my ears but for me that is enough to drive me up the walls.  then she did the play with it with out really touching it thing that she is overwhelmingly good at.  this went on for about 3 hours before her mom called and said her spy saw my car still there and said i had to leave.  I was so happy and upset it was escruciatingly fun.  she torments me so.  but its too late to dump her and too early to tell her i love her and get some.  I don't do that anyways not like i ever had to.  sorry little ego trip.  i like her alot and will wait as long as it takes.  
When i got home moms already had half the lights up and was waiting for me to get home and finish the rest.  Then we went to target and got my printer cartridges and some paper along with Shrek, Nemo, and Bruce ALMIGHTY.  Three great movies and i watched them all in one setting.  i dont usually have that long of an attention span but for some reason i couldn't get up. Oh yeah i am a lazy ass I completly forgot.  
I haven't ate much either.  Saving room for turkey day.  I have to wake up early tomarrow to drive to Maryville.  We have to take two cars cause we made so many pies and other food.  Im driving one and i think my sis is driving the other.  
I swear if one more fucking pop up disrupts my typing im gonna hunt down its creator and slit their throat.
were was i.  Oh yeah food.  I get to eat twice tomarrow and that most like will equal 5-8 times.  seconds and thirds mabey fourths.  desert if i can fit it in.  
Well happy turkey day to all and to all a good night.  Wait thats the night before chrismas.  im such a dumb ass.  well we need a turkey day saying.  Gobble gobble is out.  how about ""eat 'til you explode and screw the diet."" There thats better. Glad i could help."

"event","School started off bad with a test i forgot about and bombed and i skipped Econ.  I engineering i flew through the work and was ready to leave but my instructor likes to talk to me about my life.  He wants me to quit smoking which im in the process of but he is all up in my face about it.  He also wants to make sure im doing good in my other classes.  He wants me to call him at home and talk to him about the stresses and such that are in my life.  He is a cool guy and everything but he is too involved.  He can't leave well enough alone.  he wants the best and won't settle for anything less.  
Then when i got to work today both the front desk main computers were down where we ring up our league fees and shoe rentals and that stuff.  Out techy person can to fix the first one but put it under the mini bars code so we were trying to sell alcohol through it.  Then when we get ahold of corprate they give us little help, very little.  I was also stuck at the counter by myself for the entire night.  I only got in one cig.  That could be a good thing since i want to quit anyway but not on sucha crazy day.  At least the horny girl, as we call her now, wasn't there.  
One good thing came from tonight.  I get to pick up my girly tomarrow from where ever shes gonna be at and take her home.  hopefully we get to play at least a little bit.  
Turkey day doesn't sound too promising.  I have to go all the way to Maryville for family fun.  all of my family.  Get ready for a rant from that disaster.  And sorry for that shameless plug and the one im about to do again.
Tuesday nights are quarter mania nights and your friendly AMF Pro Bowl.  That means for your first game you pay $5.00 and $.25 for shoes and $.25 for every game after that per person.  Tonight we had a good sized group but we could do alot better.  We had mabey 15-20 lanes going out of 48 so spread the word and enjoy a cheap night of family friendly fun.  Or just woop a friends ass at bowling.  remember this goes on every tuesday and you're more than welcome to stop by.  I love my job.  and they love me thats why i haven't got my raise yet.  You'll be hearing about that soon to if they don't get with it.  
Well happy turkey day if i don't get to the computer tomarrow and have a safe and fun holiday week end."

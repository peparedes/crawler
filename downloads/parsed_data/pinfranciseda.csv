My birthday was another to remember, and well, LCBO watch out for your next regular customer.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><u>My shout outs</u></em>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I want to thank Melanie Her. for that 30minute phone call from the other end of this planet - THANK YOU. Thanks for the greet. Seriously, that made my day. On another note, I guess this explains those who called but wasn't able to get a hold of me -- sorry I don't know how to PICK-UP my second line. Thanks again, and see you soon homiie.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shout outs to Ellaine and Julian O. for taking me out to lunch - thank you. I told you guys that God loves me, and you guys were just thinking too much about rain falling. So, I didn't get what I wanted after all =( Kidding! LOL. No, seriously, thank you guys. Soon we will sacrifice ;) (our inside joke, don't watch that)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marian...oh Marian. Shout outs to you for being forever so late *ahem ahem* THANKS! After 51minutes of my birthday you've finally called and greeted. Lol, I'm kidding. You know I love you homie! And yes, you were INTENTIONALLY first to greet me =) - Our&nbsp;""talks""&nbsp;are just TOO funny you soon to-be converted bastard!!!Only my siblings call me ""THAT NICKNAME"" I guess you're one of them!.&nbsp;Thank you my sister from another Moja.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Steph and Krista: Well, Hmmmm I don't know where to start lol. Hmmm. Steph, although you couldn't make FRIDAY happen, still I want to thank you for <em>not</em> CALLING me =( LOL hahah kidding! As my first shout out explains why I missed your call - sorry. And thanks for calling @ 12:20am - lol. We most definitely need to chill..soon! Seeing how I haven't seen/talk to you in so long! There's a lot of catching up to do...I think. I'm pretty sure you know your way around the ""Reference Library"" by now. I guess we can never ever get lost anymore and somehow walk around the WHOLE so many blocks. That still makes me laugh. Thank you.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krista....oh Krista. There's just TOO much to say. Homework before Francis (I'll always remember) - KIDDING! lol. No seriously KIDDING!!! I balanced the ""angriness"" by leaving some guilt in the conversation --Thank you - for calling to ask for andrea's number! (PLAIN COLD!) LOL. It's too bad that you're leaving Don Mills Superstore and going to your homeland - sad. You owe me some HM2G btw. Still, <em>we'</em>ll miss you (we as in Andrea and myself lol).Finally, read my notes, it just might make your day =)&nbsp;Thank you for the greet once again.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=""5"">To everyone&nbsp;else that took the time to make 26th to remember for - thank you all.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font></p><p><font size=""2""></font><font size=""2""><br /></font></p>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh wow can this class be any more boring? So, I'm in my Children's Literature class right now - damn these exam reviews. I had no choice but to attend this prep class because of my lack in attending these classes. I've got no idea what the exam will be - I should really start listening rather then being on this. I'm waiting endlessly for the end of the class; which is the end of the semester as well. Also, give us our damn essays back already! She did mention something about ""I Love You Forever,"" she remembered my book - might be a good thing then? Ahh this is driving me crazy! I'm&nbsp; uncomfortable sitting here completely doing nothing - first year college will finish in exactly 20minutes and counting.

Goodbye

LSFM - attend your class more frequently.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning 7AM -- it's not easy waking up this early, but seeing how I had an 8AM-4:30PM shift I really did have no choice. Work consisted with me dealing with many angry customers with nothing better to do but rant to me about the service. Got nothing the whole day but people constantly yapping at me and going all crazy mode on me. What the mother****ing shit did I do to any of you? Damn you f***ing cheap ass low life A-O's fighting for every penny you can possibly get back - yes even if it was a penny, they still did bitched for it. I can go on and on, and the list just never stops, but I don't want to waste any more time. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to contradict myself with the phrase of ""I LOVE WORK."" Aside from dealing with those rude/angry/bitch/mean/worthless customers; I must say that I really am happy with where I am. I can write so much, but I don't want to brag about my job. So, lets continue on the day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Good afternoon."" ""Vache!"" Two close friends of mine decided to chill after I finish my shift - Vache and JEN.G. It took us a quite a while to decide where we would eat, and sooner or later we all knew that it would be CONGEE (damn you Vache). The ""conversations"" were - lets not explain that. So, after lunch we came across the idea of eating a sundae ice-cream (ice-cream sundae?) while watching ""The Usual Suspects,"" and damn you once again Vache for not coming. Had a wonderful ""date"" with Jen.G (If you're reading this, then I know you're laughing), and of course another third wheeler Andrea (lol-ing once again). The dessert was something I've never made before, and let me just explain to you how good it was........... I can't seem to find words that express my thoughts. I'm glad that Jen.G found the movie to be an amazing work of art - watch the movie! And the day ended with me driving the twins plus1 to their habitat, and driving back home alone is insanely boring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here I am writing this day entry that happened yesterday, and ready to fall asleep anytime soon. But first, let me write about other things while I'm at it. One, I couldn't be any more happier with the fact that I'm going to Philippines once again - I really am EXCITED. I hope our plan works (even though we have none yet) and hopefully get to see each other while we're down there....(TO BE CONTINUED)

I&nbsp;started the essay about&nbsp;12hours ago, at work, and I was able to finish it all before the deadline. What problem did I come across?&nbsp;THE SUBMISSION SITE WOULDN'T LOAD ON ME!!&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT A&nbsp;PISSOFF. I had to go through such an&nbsp;obstacle just to hand it in&nbsp;(thank&nbsp;you MCH). And now it's 2andahalf hours late cause the damn site wouldn't load.&nbsp;JUSTGREAT.Marks will most def. be deducted. On another note, the essay was a ""last-minute"" essay and which I&nbsp;did half of it while working in RCSS holy smokes -&nbsp;that's just sad. I'm angry.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision on a&nbsp;Saturday completed my month. As much as I want to explain how&nbsp;pissed of I am/was, I refuse to because&nbsp;still I couldn't help but be proud of myself due to the total amount of work&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were able to do throughout the day.Thank you again MCH and JO for stopping by, that too made my day. I've learn why my managers find it so hard to supervise on weekends, and it's because of the craziness and the total amount of people that refuse to work. I'd like to thank all those that made my day so much easier than it should've been and the people that worked so hard. Thank you. Although I did look quite foolish in that red ""fitted"" vest - thank you for pointing that out at the end of my shift, still i did enjoy the night and look forward into supervising again.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, to M.Claudio. First I want to apologize if I made you feel that I was mad at you. Really if my message states that ""I don't love you"" it's because I'm contradicting myself and that really I do love you ..... as a&nbsp;friend, as a sister that I've always looked up to, as someone who I know will always have my back, for who you are, for always putting that smile on my face,&nbsp;and for making me write this part of the entry about you. I was never mad at you, and really I did know and understand that you have a SHITLOAD of work to do, and I envy you for that because you're so committed to school. I guess it was wrong of me to write that message on your wall on the first place because I highly doubt that nobody would understand that I was never serious. Again, I'm sorry.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is the part where I say...goodnight motha*****s for I am now going to sleep because I've finally sent that damn essay.&nbsp;<br /><br />Goodnight motha******s&nbsp;<br /><br />LSFM - doing essays last minute just doesn't work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img height=""286"" alt="""" width=""300"" src=""http://photos-d.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v134/125/71/504252024/n504252024_412427_4541.jpg"" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em><font size=""1"">and this is why&nbsp;&lt;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.foolishness</font></em><br />&nbsp;"

My mind seems to be everywhere right now. I really don't know anymore, so please don't hear me out. I'm definitely confused at this point- why? I really don't know. I can't seem to sleep, and maybe that explains why I'm still awake right now. My thoughts seem to be going at every direction possible in my head.

Then sister asked me I wanted to buy something from forever21 - they've got mens clothing now, because she had this 21% off discount card. What's the catch? It was only for today. So, I got ready and had my work attire just in case I wasn't going to make it back home in time. The only problem to this journey I was going to take was that I had no bus ticket nor coins - oh no. Searched the house for whatever I can get, under the bed, couch, stairs, closets, pockets, and to my surprise I only found $.10 - ahh! So, I walked to 7eleven, not that far, and all for what? To hear, ""Sorry we don't take visa for bus tickets,"" and my debit card has a current balance of $1.20. What am I going to do? Time is running out and I still haven't gotten in any TTC vehicle. So, my last option - walked all the way to ""The Plaza,"" which by the way was so far, and all for what? To hear, ""Sorry we don't accept visa on bus tickets."" You can probably guess what I did from here on..yup WALKED all the way back to mon maison - blah. So, I finally gave up this journey that I was excited to take. Ahh, but wait, somehow an idea pops in my head. Because my work starts at 5:00PM I was able to make it just in time to catch my sister and give her the card to buy me something - good thinking. So, went to work and gave my sister the cards and asked her to buy me whatever that was there - aren't I a genius?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work finally came along and so I took action for my unthinkable plan and gave the discount cards to my sister. Work was pretty much the same as every other Sunday. You know, do this and that and this and that - blahblahblah. The store closes at 8:00PM, and why is it that people don't seem to understand that? Around 8:55PM a customer comes, ""I need to buy sugar, what time are you guys close?"" Look around! There's no lane open, the store lights are merely opened, and all the workers are sitting down waiting for 9:00PM to come. Oh and another thing ""are you going to circa?""

Instead I enjoyed dinner at BostonsPizza with a couple of friends. My night has only begun. So we had a few good conversations here and there, and most of them were about ""life""&nbsp; - don't worry we weren't high . How will everyone be in so many years from now? Who will be this and that? Ahh stuff like that - kinda scares me though. So while stuffing my face with a $10.00 starter, I get a phone a call from my sister.<br /><br />To&nbsp;Monday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went with my sister, niece and nephew to a family friend's house around 12:00AM to sleepover.

"event","<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=""3"">CP24 states that it will be snowing&nbsp;throughout the week&nbsp;- boo!&nbsp;Suddenly I have an interest in indie movies....random. I'm&nbsp;debating on college choices right now. I need more hours from RCSS. I wanted to write about ""the dream"" on LJ, so I will.&nbsp;</font><br /><font size=""3""><font size=""2"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two nights ago, I had this dream. I was at the beach with ""you,"" and you wrapped your hands around mine while walking along the shore. I was happy. It felt as if nothing mattered around us. And then I woke up, and I couldn't help but notice this ""feeling"" in me that I had. I can't really explain it, but for some reason I felt&nbsp; ......bllaahhh I don't even know what&nbsp;that ""feeling"" is/was. For some reason I couldn't help but think about this ""dream"" of mine the whole day. What did it mean? Why were ""you"" there? Why were ""we"" together?&nbsp;<br /></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, that seems EMO, but really I'm not. I just wanted to express this strange but rather interesting dream of mine. I can't really say much more about it because that was the only scene that I dreamt of. I don't know what else to say, I really am without words right now. I also wanted to write about my ""strange"" nights. For some odd reason, I've been waking up in the middle of the nights around 3-4am for no reason!&nbsp;<br /><font size=""2"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night around 3-4am, I woke up with the sound of a dog crying. I was in such a deep sleep and then all of a sudden I start hearing this dog cry - that's random I must say. There's three single beds in my room, all three in a parallel formation. My sister was gone for her volleyball tournament in Sudburry, and my other sister, who was two beds away from me, was in her deep sleep. I heard this dog crying and barking, and so I sat down to see where it was coming from, and to my surprise the sound was coming from the side of my sisters bed - to answer your question, I was scared as hell. I woke up my sister right away asking ""do you hear that?"" And what scared me the most was that, right when I asked her, the sound of the crying dog was gone. I wished that she heard what I heard, so that I wouldn't be the only one. The cries of this dog seemed so ""sad"" and ""frightened."" What did this mean? Why did a dog visit me? Why was it crying? Why is it that when I woke up my sister the sound had left?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another strange ""night""of mine. You might be thinking that it was just a dream or this and that, but I wish I can say/think the same. To be honest, I don't know how to explain myself. I mean, what else is there to say? I woke up in the middle of the night because a sad dog was crying beside my sisters bed. When my sister came home from work, she asked me ""what happened last night? What did you hear?"" And all these other questions. I only said as much as I explained to you right now. Maybe this encounter of mine has something to do with the fact that I once had a dog back home and died while I was here, and the sad part was that I didn't even know the date that ""it"" died. BLAAHHH why am I talking about this? Ok, so here's what I don't know is a wise decision on my part whether I should write or not. Well I do want to express my thoughts on this right? So, I will. I've been told by my family members that my grandma, who passed away, had this puppy with her all the time, and somehow it reminded me of her. When we left, I think we left more then just a dog, but we also left puppies. So, she had this one favorite puppy that she always petted and they said that she would pet it because it was MY favorite one of them all, and so the puppy&nbsp;reminded me&nbsp;of her.&nbsp;Ok I'm going to stop here.&nbsp;<br /></font>"

The greetings that were sent to my mobile&nbsp;device&nbsp;brought joy into me because the people that I expected less from&nbsp;actually took time to click that ""send"" button. From ""Happy Halloween,"" whom I never knew till this morning to ""Merry Christmas baby love,"" which made me laugh tremendously, oh marian how you make me smile. And from the message that never made it into my cellphone, are you sure you sent me one? I joke, but thank you. What I've been wanting to buy finally came inside a perfectly wrapped box, but still I tore it apart. This year is nearly coming to an end, and excited I am for the next celebration. I end this ""journal"" with, MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, and of course a soon to be A HAPPY NEW YEARS.&nbsp;<br /><br />"

"event","&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><strong>First </strong>day of school... woke up&nbsp;with the feeling of excitement in my head. Ready to enter a whole new world, but this time no friends by my side.<br />......Great&nbsp;gotta make new friends.&nbsp;. Missed&nbsp;the first class of the day, of the sem., of the&nbsp;year, and lastly of my college life!&nbsp;Thought i had it figured out, but building&nbsp;A was bigger than&nbsp;i thought it would be. Hidden hallway and staircase leading to my designated class...I did not find.&nbsp;Decided to give up since there was only 20minutes and counting left of class. Decided to look for my next class to avoid the same problem..<br /><br />Sleep-ins on tuesday and wednesday nights....&nbsp;"

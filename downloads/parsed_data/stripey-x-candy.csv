"event","well I finally got my lip pierced ^_^ Sssoo kewl ^_^ I got to Pariah piercings, filled out a form, and went into the room. My piercer was so hott =D haha the numbing stuff made my tongue and lips feel 3 times bigger than they are and the guy kept trying to talk to me and I was like sitting there trying my best to talk back lol he showed me two rings, but somehow the first one he picked for me was made for me haha he called it candy striped and it's blue and pink, I thought it was weird 'cause my name is Stripey Candy =P he clamped my lip and put the needle through, it was a pain I could put up with, then he went to put the ring through, and the tubing came out! so he was like ""ah, the tubing has come out, do you mind if I put a needle through it again?"" so I told him no, go for it. He did, and it looks great ^_^ My lip is a little swollen but not much, it bled a lot though.
He couldn't think of anyway I could cover my piercing for work, so looks like I'm gonna have to pay a visit to the boss in the next few days lol
I can't wait for it to heal 'cause I'd like a smaller ring, but this is kewl until then ^_^ I'll post pics next week when my hair is sorted. Ordered some dreads that should be here anytime now =D
So anyone in Cornwall thinking about getting a piercing, <b>Pariah Piercings</b> is the place to go! =D"

"event","Rhi tagged me to do this...

List three random facts about yourself that your friends might not know (good or bad) and then tag four other friends to do it.

1. um, I like some club music. 'Gatecrasher classics' that new album is a perfect example =) I want it.

2. When I was about 10 I had one of my drawings published on the front cover of a cookery book lol

3. My worst fear is being buried alive, even the thought of it terrifies me. 

I'll tag the only 3 people on my friends list that I haven't already seen this done by:

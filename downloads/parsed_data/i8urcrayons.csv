"event","so everyone else is really bored being home when no one else is home yet, but is anyone else bored in the oc because they are visiting their family and no one is home there, either?

I am. i came to orange to visit my aunt,uncle and cousins. So i got here on saturday and i got to see my uncle tim for a couple of hours, then he left for taiwan. i got to see my aunt nancy and cousin scott until sunday when they left for las vegas (scott had a firefighter test to take there) and my cousin kara had an english project to do, so we didnt go with them. she went to a friends house to work on it for a couple hours on sunday. i mostly slept, cuz i have been really sick and too weak to do like anything else. kara was at school on monday till like 8:30. i saw nancy and scott for a few hours once they got back. kara had school again today-scott was at the gym and is now at school (when he was home, i was sleeping) and nancy has been at work. 

i guess its cool that i have had all of this time to do nothing but sleep, since im not really missing out on anything.

i just heard someone open the door. imma go investigate.

happy birthday shan!"

"event","so today, i went to the grocery store with Karen. I got milk and yogurts and water n stuff. Well when i went to pay for them, i pulled out my wallet and noticed that i could no longer hear my keys jingling. so i looked around where i was for them (in the basket, my purse, the bag they put my food in) and i couldnt find them. i told karen and we started scouring the store and all of the aisles i had gone through (the store is no larger than the quickstop in rayleys shopping center) and we couldnt find them. I started to panic because my key ring has my dorm keys on it (they cost some outrageous amount to replace) my po box key, my bike lock key (i rode my bike to the store) my car key, and the key to my room at home. we even got the manager of the store helping us look. When we couldnt find them he took down my info and said that he would go through the surveilance tapes with the owner to trace my steps and find out what happened to my keys. so karen and i started walkin home and the lady who checked my groceries came out holding my keys!!!!!!! oh god i was so happy. SO happy! this couple found them when they were looking at a display.

so guess where/ what display they were at...

-the donut/cupcakes display. I dont even remember walking by it. my subconscious musta been working hard this morning huh?"

"event","I see like one barefoot person a day, walking around school, or skateboarding around school. And its a different person every day- or a different couple of people, depending on how many barefoot people i see. I wonder if they wear sandals in the shower? Or if they are afraid of like, getting worms or something from walkin around on the grass/cement all the time. they must have thick callouses. when you get a callous, isnt it just dead skin piling on top of itself? so it would make you taller, if only by a little bit, wouldnt it? gross.

so for those of you whom i dont talk to on a regular basis, ucsb is pretty awesome. i decided not to do crew (much to the dismay of my ego, which is dwindling due to the inflation of fat cells on my body). it was really expensive. perhaps i will save up this summer so i can do it next year.

Being in college makes me spacy. I like, dont pay attention to stuff that i am saying or typing anymore. Earlier i almost asked ""I wonder if they wear showers in the sandals?"" and things like that occur multiple times every day. but i HAVE been keeping up on reading, studying and the like, absorbing material like mad (i hope)....

in everything but spanish (my major, go figure). Cristina must think i am such a dunce. When we are doing an exercise in class, she ALWAYS calls on me for the ONE answer that i got wrong. Im sure the other kids in the class think im pretty dense as well. Its not my imagination. Today we were doing this exercise where we'd look at a picture with a 2 verbs underneath it, say whether the action in the picture is reflexive or reciprocal and then make a sentence using the appropriate verb under the pic. I knew the answers to all of the pictures when the other kids were called, but of course, Cristina calls on me for the last one. And the last one just happens to have verbs underneath it that are neither reciprocal or reflexive, the question was not applicable to that box. Is she setting me up on purpose? i wonder."

"event","SO I'm in SB for those of you who don't know. I LOVE the location. its gorgeous. holy cow. havent been feeling too much like myself so for the first couple of days i didnt meet toooooooo many people and i got kinda worried. everyone that i told was like ""its only the second day, chill out"" including my mom- so i listened, and ive met more people since. guess they were right ;P

i am going surfing today! im super excited. super duper excited. kristina welch is going with me and letting me use her board, and my friend karen let me borrow her wet suit (since she is rushing all day). how nice is that? i made her a necklace, she was happy. 

so i have a 19 meal a week meal plan. annnnndddd i dont eat that often. and if i do eat its not in the dining commons. yesterday i ate dinner there and thats it, and i think the same for the day before. but they wont let you change it to 14 until the end of the quarter. AND if you have friends come, your friends cant use your extra meals, AND they dont ""rollover"" into the next week. you have 19 a week and thats all there is to it. HOW FUCKING MESSED UP IS THAT. it angers me. i need to make a friend in that place and get them to let my friends use my meals cuz i cant eat there three times a day. oh, and 14 a week is the least a beginning student can get. grrrrr! what a waste of cash

i wonder if people will read this, i skip over long entries, but i dont post too often, so maybe you little tigers will be curious. 

i dont want this to end on an unhappy note. I am going surfing!"

"event","since i updated. the past few days have been eventful so i thought id finally have something to say.

im at my moms office right now and shes working so i have nothing to do but hang out online and read peoples lj's. reading about everyone being off at college or leaving soon makes me feel something. I dont know whether its anxious or nostaligic or what, but its not normal. But- Griffin has been sick lately, which means that im probably getting it because my stomach has been acting so weird lately, so maybe im just nauscious?

one of my co workers-Galen broke his hand today while he was biking into work =^( poor boy. When kaiser called to tell me he wouldnt be in i asked how he was doing and she was like ""uh, ill let him tell you when he gets out"". that made me worry, if it was really only a broken hand i would hope that he would be able to say ""man i feel like shit"" or something along those lines. well since galen wasnt there, i started pulling tarps when james came in and he is so strong that he was tearing them out of the water and my crank flew off and hit me in the corner of my mouth. it hurts to smile, and talk and pretty much do anything that involves moving my lips. whatev, I can deal. 

I really want to go buy bamboo for my fish bowl, and id like to go to the doctor so they can check my tb shot and i wont have to get another one. why cant i just take the truck? i dont know. lets ask and hope my mom doesnt get too mad (shes very frustrated right now). wish me luck!"

"event","just got home from staff training. we did this event where 2 ppl from your x-game team would get weight belts placed across the floor of the pool 5 yards apart. does that make sense? like, one in every square going the short way across the pool. So one member from your team goes at a time. this person jumps in feet first, swims under water, gets the closest weight, comes back underwater and gets out and lays it down. no breaths can be taken once you are in the pool. well i just happened to be 1 of the 2 people picked from my team and i TOTALLY fucked up cuz i went for the farthest one first!! i was thinking (gotta get the farthest one, so julia (the other person picked) doesnt have to hold her breath as long) but that was stupid, cuz every person gets the weights re-set for them. AND you are supposed to get the closest one first. what the fuck, i am dumb. i was down yesterday, and today isnt helping. but at least i get to go to lunch with hannah, and rock climbing later. OHOHOH! and i am learnin ""blackbird"" on the guitar. woo haa

i must give some credit to kevin quirico who got all 5 weights up on deck. what a savage. too bad hes not on my team anymore =^(

and to bilotti, who got 4 and would have tried for 5 if keith didnt stop him cuz he looked like he might black out."

So i am thinking to myself ""where is everyone?"" until i realize that they are all asleep, cuz its early, which is weird to me because i got to sleep in today. I am getting used to waking up at 5:30 for work. BLAH I still dont like it though.

So i went to orientation last weekend. It was cool. SUPER informative. I couldnt imagine signing up for classes without academic advising. The session where we actually signed up for stuff was intense. I took a Spanish placement test. I expected to be put in Spanish 2 because i havent taken spanish in like 2 years and the last one i took was Spanish 3. BUUUUUUUUUUT i was put in Spanish 4!!! WOOHOO!

For the student night out they let us go into Isla Vista from like 9 till whenever we wanted. There were parties on like every street and lotsa people just walkin around. seeing as how its summer and there arent many people there, I bet it gets SO insane during the school year. Me and some kids went to this one party for this kid's birthday, and they called some girl grandma cuz she threw out her back earlier that day. and everyone was pretty gone. it was more like a gathering, only like 8 or 9 people. then we went to another with a band, but it was in a backyard the size of my room and we werent really into the music so we left. SO our party experience wasnt too exciting. we DID pass a mexican party that was goin pretty strong though. We didnt go in cuz we would have felt out of place, not being mexican and all. 

When we got back everyone went to their own dorms, and my roommate (Karen) came in with some boys and we all just hung out. It was my first time meeting her. She was so nice! a little out of it, but she was drunk and not annoying so i thought that was pretty cool. Got to sleep around 4 that night. 

dont know how to end this. the ride back home sucked. car broke down 2 and a half hours from home, but now we are renting a lincoln town car.sooooooo its not THAT bad"

Any of you college kids have any ideas that i might not think of? so then we did the makeup thing. woo fun. i actually got some. surprised? me too. will i wear it? probably not. so then we went to sur la table. I love that store too. little fun kitchen gismos with lots of moving parts and shiny metal makes me so excited. And they have all of these dishes for foods and accessories for your table in primary colors and iono. i just get happy in that store. so we bought this apple corer/peeler/slicer for will. and i just used it and its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool! it makes eating apples a lot more fun. not that it wasnt fun to begin with, but yeah. i wonder if anyone will read this, it looks kinda long to me."

You would think it would be the other way around... actually teaching would make me more nervous... oh well.

After however many hours of rehearsal she went with us for her first time and climbed really well. I was done after like 2 or 3 routes my first day. I bouldered those v1s again. Its awesome when you work out the problem and do the route entirely with technique. (well not entttiiirely, but pretty close) I also did a 10a. It was a really crappy one tho. Nat did it much better. She is really a much better climber. I think i will try to do more of them. Saturday was spin/run. It was good. Freakin hard. Diego got mad at me for only drinking water. Then i went to see starsky and hutch with griffin. It was way better than i thought it would be. Not horribly funny but it did have funny parts. Sunday i got my prom dress! yippeeee... its not anything spectacular. But it was cute and rel. inexpensive and it was an <U>extra small</U> so i will be walkin around prom saying to people.. ""oh what a beautiful dress! what size is it? oh a -3?&nbsp;Oh, well&nbsp;mine is an extra small"" not really tho, if it were a true extra small i wouldnt be able to fit in it.

"event",".... and it is soft and purple (in honor of what her name would have been... ""purple"" in korean) sooooo i have finally learned how to crochet beanies and i am like a beanie factory. this will be my 5th and i learned on friday at the gym. I tried to climb a 10 a and failed cuz i suck.... nat climbed up it helluv fast i hear. But she is a better climber than i am, dont listen to her if she says otherwise.

SO interesting times at sarah g's wedding.....Carol Ann and Sarah were both so gorgeous! i loved the color theme of the wedding: blue and silver with white calla lilies (i know that is spelled incorrectly, whatev)so i guess white as well. The yacht club looked so pretty with all of the candles and the 120 odd napkins that two ladies and i rolled up (geesh... they were unrolled in an instant... ::sigh::). so onto the interesting part...

My mom got drunk, and she was dancing..... oh dear.

it was fine for a while, but then she was doing this thing where she would repeatedly run into me with her stomach. like bouncing off of me, and i kept stumbling and she just kept coming.. after that she spinning me and spinning me and spinning me, and herself as well. She really doesnt know how strong she is, she was pushin me all sorts of different ways and i had to be like ""mom!! you are making me dizzy!"" like 4 times before she stopped. But she did, and eventually i got tired of dancing (its kinda hard when you have to limit your movements to strictly ""g"" rated (head bopping and jumpin around) , even tho the other drunk folks on the dance floor were definitely getting more riskay than that...)(ok... i exaggerated... its not that difficult). Theres more but its not necessary to post. I feel like im talking shit about my mom with this entry enough. But she was having fun and she was actually acting better than some of the other drunk people there. I just wish it didnt take 20 minutes to get her off the dance floor (20 minutes and 20 candlestick holders). 

Sarah if you read this tell your mom and Dick that i am so happy for them and wish them the best!!! 

i just realized bitchy could be a mood... and even tho i am not feeling completely bitchy i will use it because i was talkin shit about my mom, like a mean person. =^("

Wait for the guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot...  Who calls you back when you hang up on him... Will stay awake just to watch you sleep...Wait for the guy who kisses your forehead...

"event","im feelin kinda lame... which is lame considering the day i had. 

school was fine... found out my physics test isnt till nextttttt week, SWEET. I thought it was tomorrow and that would have sucked cuz i wouldnt really have time to study/do my hw today. Soooo i go take my LGI test agaiiiiiin cuz i failed the first time like a goober. But the first test had all of these questions about like.. how long each class i can teach is and what the pre-reqs are and all of that... and the second test i took didnt have like any of those ?s so i would have passed that had i taken it yesterday. Whatev, i am dumb, i can deal.

SO why i feel lame and shouldnt... after school, i passed my LGI test then went to the gym and did an hour of yoga, an hour of spin and an hour of abs... afterwards, clayton, jared and paul and i went out to thai food at this HELLLLLLUV good place next to the spaghetti factory and i had the best pork, rice and cucumber salad thing EVER. It was soooooooooo good. SO im really rather happy after this... and then i am takin paul home...

and i told him about how shan and i are applying to hollister and i think its funny and he said ""yeah that is"" and kinda laughed. and i said ""itd be even funnier if i got hired"" and he said ""yeah, it would be... no offense"" while laughing. so the kid thinks im ugly which is weird cuz hes so focused on looks annnnnd we were ""an item"" or whatever. I shouldnt let his opinion get to me at all but it does so i feel kinda lame about that. I also feel badly because i was just reminded that this weekend is v-day and jimmy will be frolicking with dana... kinda stings. i think this entry has gone on long enough."

"event","<P>so the funniest part of the day:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was leaving the staff mtg. and my windows were kinda foggy so i couldnt really identify any cars behind me. I could see the headlights... but not like... whos car and what not. SO anyhow we are all leaving and for some reason i thought that hannah was behind me. I guess it was because she was honking and stuff at me for going slow behind the cars in front of me that were going slow (not really my fault huh? yeah...). So I (thinking that i am in front of hannah) go SUPER slow and swerve all over the road so she cant pass me and just mess around and stuff. and shes honkin and flashin her lights, so i revv my engine and roll down my window and im flippin her off for like 10 seconds... and i finally get past the stop sign and go towards the light and this red truck passes me up! im like... ohhhh man, that was so not hannah. but it was damn funny. that person must have been so mad at me! hahahahahaha... im not a nice person but it was a misunderstanding so it was really hilarious to me. i almost cried laughing. </P>"

<P>After school i had totally forgotten about the sectional which was lame cuz i was rushing to get to yoga in concord on time... but, i missed that because i thought the class started at 4:30 and it starts at 4.&nbsp;sad times. so i cant take yoga at all.. cuz all of the other classes are during work or during lgi training... so not for the next few weeks anyhow. </P>
<P>Well i go home to some mixed up craziness (its not necessary to elaborate here) and then i go to work, which was cool till i heard that we had to get in the water for our staff training meeting that night. It was soo cold! but the water was Very VERy warm so that was nice. The staff mtg. was one of the more stressfull ones. Being told that we were doing lots and lots of stuff wrong for an hour, then into the water for a continuous heads up freestyle swim with random people being picked out to assess an unconscious dummy on the deck and do cpr and everything like that. It wasnt difficult, just not super easy like i expected. THE BEST PART OF THE DAY will be in my next entry so people will be sure to read it. cuz this ones kind of long and this part is helluv funny... to me anyhow.</P>"

She says she doesnt dislike him, because she has no basis for judgement but i think she does. She told my brother that she missed jimmy the other day. Ok mom... let us get back together so you can no longer suffer from missing my ex-boyfriend.

I went to the gas station to get some pads cuz i ran out today and didnt feel like going to rayleys or safeway. And im paying for them and the teller guy is talking to someone on the phone and he said something about id? like... she would need i.d. And im like ""excuse me?"". And he laughed and said he was talking to the guy on the phone. Yeah i was wondering why i would need I.D. to buy some pads. Ok... so i bought my stuff and (this part wasnt embarrassing) im about to walk out and he asks me if i go clubbing a lot and i said no, i was only 17 and he was surprised cuz he thought i was like 21! damn... coulda bought alcohol.

Jeez Mac. go sit on a can. grrr. so we were playing ""an american in paris"" today and i think we got it before break and we were supposed to practice it over break who in the world is going to practice something for someone else during their vacation time? she for sure didnt study her ish either. I guess the flutes played super super badly today because she was like full on yelling at caity during the song and when we stopped to fix us. Ok macheel, lets just have caity make us better in the middle of class. Im sure she got the msg the first time your flapping lips spat it on her. fuck you man. Im mostly just mad cuz i REALLy need to get gas before going to work (i have to be there at 3:15) and i just planned on getting it at lunch today. But it was really shitty of her to yell at caity simply because the other flutes in the band arent spectacular. Ugh and she tells me i am her ""project"" like she needs to make me smile because i dont do it enough. Too bad i just hate her. I find it difficult to pretend like im happy to see you when your face has such a strong effect on my gagging reflex. rant is done... i must write a refreshed post now."

"event","because thats all i feel like writing about. iwent to the doc today and they took a throat culture for strep, ill know in a few days. and then prescribed antibiotics and what not. so i came home and took them and a vicodin and drank some juice (gotta keep up them fluids) and i went to sleep and then i woke up and was kinda sittin around and i coughed and started to throw up, luckily i have a little trash can handy for that, cuz it was purple... i cant even keep down juice. SO i thought it was the vic. and i ate a piece of bread to settle my stomach and drank water. and then like 30 minutes later i threw that up. god, this is hellllllof fun. when i went to the doc they asked me if i wanted an antibiotic shot just to get things jump started and i was like yeah.. sure. And they told me to pick the hip i like least cuz thats where it goes, but it reallllllly goes in your ass. so i had some lady like pinching my ass while she gave me the shot. the shot didnt hurt, but the medicine did. My mom said it was because the meds were thick and were movin things around (how gross). so anyhow, that was pretty much my day. I just had some grapes so hopefully i wont lose those tonight too. so does anyone want to help me out with usin this thing? like where to put the music im listening to or how i feel? i really dont know how to do anything. thhhhhhhhannnnkkk you. hey, i just acc. pressed something and found out how to do all that. god im a dumbass."

"event","I think I'm dying. Last night I woke up crying because my throat hurt so badly. I woke up my mom and she had me sit on the couch and roll ice around in the back of my throat to soothe it cuz nothing else worked. I tried this throat numbing spray (ended up numbing my tongue), throat lozenges, even vicodin didnt work. And she gave me a few ibuprofens to use as well and i was kinda iffy about that because i hadnt eaten anything in a while and usually strong medicine like vicodin upsets my stomach when it doesnt have anything in it. But i took the ibu. anyhow and my stomach did complain, but it wasnt sooooooo bad when i was lying down. so this morning i wake up to a really sore body and my throat still really hurt, and my mom brought me more ice and i had just finished a piece when i started to cough, and then i threw up in the trash can. It was like water and green mucus. a LOT of green mucus. I almost threw up again just from seeing it. SO last night (i woke up around 3) we called the doctor and my mom was gonna have me go to the hospital but she doesnt think they could do anything for me other than give me drugs, and it was prolly better for me to sit until i fell asleep at home instead of waiting in the emergency rom forever. I didnt realize how sick I was. I had another fever this morning when i woke up. i stayed home yesterday mainly because i thought id be totally fine after one more day of rest, but today i really feel awful. I cant even talk, or sleep because im not tired enough to cancel out the pain when i lie down. I think i am going to stop complaining now. I will get ready for the doctor instead."

You know i read other peoples journals and tho most of them only post about what they did that day i still find it interesting but i cant seem to believe that people would care enough to read about what I did. esp if it consists solely of reading ""The perks of being a wallflower"" (very good, i suggest you read it) and sleeping on the couch. So before I go any further lemme just say that i am SO GLAD that there are no more band reviews for another few months. honestly, 6 is about 6 too many. well not really. I wouldnt mind 3. last night stacie, caity, caitys mama and i went to palermos for a celebratory dinner which was a nice way of wrapping up the season. then i hung out with caiter-doodle (that little turkey) for a few hours and drew a picture. it was funnnnnn. Hmmm Ive been wanting to make pizza for a while now.. like the stuff from scratch. maybe ill do that soon since i have all of this newfound free time (yes!).

I was all shaky and cold and dizzy and achy and nauseous, that was bad. and mrs chini felt my head and said my temp. was 102... which is nuts cuz when i got home and took it with a thermometer, it WAS 102. I guess thats what happens when youve been a mom for a long time. being able to sit at home and sleep all day was really nice, something i def. needed. And then at practice I got to sit out and watch the band do a pass. I spotteed like 5 mistakes but im sure they were like an ""only that time around"" sorta thing. We really are rather good. When you are in the block it doesnt sound like it but we do blend and accent and all of that together. Its pretty awesome. well crap i just realized that i didnt tell my boss not to schedule me for thanksgiving break.... or did I? well shit now i have to go find out.

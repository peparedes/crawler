"event","Ok so yea i no this is more 3rd update today(promise this is my last 1 lol) but i read annas LJ and i had to put this in....its exactly how ive been feeling lately:


i don't understand.
if you love me, 
if you realized how much i do for you,
if you realized that i'm not making up all the things that i say to you, 
why can't you pull yourself together for 3 hours to do something nice for me?
why don't you start changing now?
i never really know the truth.
i don't know when to believe you. 
i want to.
i want it to be like a fairytale.
i want you to make all my problems going away, without me having to tell you to.
i want you to make me happy again; like you used to.
maybe i'm selfish.
maybe i care too much.
maybe i should stop whining.
maybe i miss you.
maybe love is supposed to hurt. 
i just don't get it.

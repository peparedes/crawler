"event","Lets see i am not doing to bad today besides the major pain in my ankle.
I am still worried about my mom but i cant do anything about that so all i can do is talk to friends and Eric.
Yeah Eric sorry i didnt answer the phone last night i was cryin again i have been in to much pain and i didnt want you to have to hear that again. Today i decided i would write in a journal besides this one and it kind of helped not much but some.
Someone told me yesterday that i was strong than most people she knew. That comment made me think and made me feel pretty good. At the same time it kind of made me feel that now i have to keep that. I mean I have to keep that strength now cuz it seems like people look up to me now but i doubt it but i dont know. The thing is I dont think I can be strong anymore it is just so hard thats what scares me sometimes because i have to keep all my stuff inside cuz i cant talk to anyone in my house so i believe i have to keep it in and if i do i dont know what i will do if i hold anymore in it is just too much.
I feel as if i am starting to complain to much so i am sorry if i am so i will stop now.
Anywayz i had a half day today it was boring!!!!!
Sci-  we finished a lab
2nd- not my class so i dont do anything
Eng- we started reading Tale of the Two Cities 
or w/e that was my school day.
I came home watched kids ate a popsickle helped with dishes and was in so much pain i went and layed down for the rest of the day till now. I am bout to leave again cuz i aint got nuttin to do except type on this but if i do any longer i will start to complain about my life more.
LOL!!! well so i am out. Gone. Peace. Buh byz.
P.S Eric I kno i aint supposed to say this first but i have to. I am pretty sure i am in love with you. Little scared to say that cuz i dont know how you will react but i had to so there."

  4th- Math. Did more equations thats it.
 Lunch- Best part of the day most amusing at least. chris harbin, Zack Abrams, and others were using my cruches as fighting tools and Zack decided he was goin to dance on the wall so he used my cruches to hold himself up. You had to be there to experience the laughter. LOL
  6th- Law. Student was comin on to the ugly teacher (he was just messin around tho) 
  7th- French. Did an assignment and then i was tryin to get my make-up work from the teacher and she ended up forgeting again and we checked papers it was funny cuz we were actually making fun of her and she was laughin about it. We were makin fun of everyone who got the same answer wrong it was hilarious u had to be there to kno. 
   Now i am home well been for a while as u probably already knew. Jovan is tryin to have me hang out wit him but i dont wnat to i got a man Eric. Yeah i am talkin to my man right now i feel bad cuz he lost his voice. It was so funny though because he talked to me with his computer it was creepin me out.

weakness. its always been something i was afraid of. i always tried to convince myself that if i denied my own weaknesses long enough, they would become strengths. but they havent. the more i ignore them, the worse they get. the more power they gain over my life. 
how many, lisa? how many can you ruin? how many can you push away? can you scar. hurt. use. they say people dont change. and i always wanted to believe they did. that i wouldnt be like this forever. that someday i would grow up and realize the way i hurt myself. and realize the way i hurt so many around me. well ive waited. when am i going to fucking grow up? when i am going to stop. sometimes i think about the people in my life. both in the past and currently. and i am so completely amazed. amazed at how lucky i have been. some of the people i have known juat amaze me. whats even harder to believe is that these people could somehow care about me, could love me. i dont know what i did to deserve it, and i know deep down i dont, but i am so thankful for these people. i try to tell these people what they mean to me. among the many other things that i inevitably do. like push them away. try to hurt them before they hurt me. avoid opening up to them. then revealing myself. i want them to know. i hope they do. they are incredible. 
cheers to you. for showing me what i believe to be the closest thing to love."

dont touch me. dont fucking lay a hand on me. id rather suffer. id rather stretch my arms out and hang my head for the world to see than to have  anything that you are come to know anything that i was.

we are once again together and once again happy. my only fear is that the past will tear us apart eventually. one can forgive but can rarely forget. if i could have control over only one thing, it would be the memories that keep him from giving in to me completely. 
if only i could erase those memories forever from his mind. i would have him back. and he would have me. 
the past is a difficult concept for me. the fact that the past was once the future and then the present, the fact that the past was real and new. the fact that the past allows you only enough of itself to continue to hurt you and be a permanent scar on your hearts and your minds, but not enough control to change it, fix it, better it. that is why the past is never really the past. its just another page. its just a different time, and its just as real as right now. and its just as painful as tomorrow.

i feel like i have two, or maybe more, completely different and separate minds sometimes. i have what seems to me to be a ""normal"" mind. this is the side that loves family and a future of marriage, and children, and a career. this is also the one that gets me out of bed in the morning and takes me to the daily and everyday activities that one must complete in ordeer to maintain the appearance of a ""normal"" and ""healthy"" existence. this is the one that knows right from wrong, though struggles to always choose right. this is the one that cares about others before itself and wants to be better, in every way. 
and then the other side, which appears to be equally dominant, and equally stubborn as the ""normal"" mind. this side keeps me from becoming the person i feel i want to be. this side creates thoughts and ideas that i could never desrcibe. thoughts so comfortable to me, so appropriate and exciting, but utterly disturbing and socially unaccepted, undesirable, and intolerable to others. this is the side that keeps me drowning in an unmotivated and unreliable drain. 
this side scares me. this side pushes people away. people i know i love and need, but cannot fully reveal myself to. 
i am tempted to label this the ""dark"" side of my mind, which i assume most people have of their own...but i do not feel it is dark. i do not feel it is wrong. it is only the environment i have been raised in that tells me it is not right. and i do understand that it shouldnt be right, but this side of me feels like home. this side of me feels like me. its the ""normal"" side that doesnt quite fit."

so...what inspires me, huh? 
thats a tough question. different things inspire me for different reasons. inspiration comes in many different forms and i am not sure which way you mean it. lets see.....the thought of learning inspires me. i enjoy feeling like i have learned something either about life or people that might not exactly be crucial to know, but it makes life a little more beautiful. or interesting. or complicated. or simple. 

poverty inspires me. not the poverty that we know. but real poverty. real despair. i would like to say that it inspires me to donate my time and money to help fight poverty, but i would be a liar...maybe thats something i need to work on. 
right now i have plenty of time in my life, during the week, during the days, that i could be volunteering at a number of places or doing a number of things. and i dont. and i should. i am perfectly capable and should share the blessings that i have been given. specifically my health and my abilities.

and speaking of uneasy situations...........i hate times and bad times and the fact that there isnt anything that can change the reality. 
i dont know."

"event","things are changing. i am changing. 
i have always feared change. i have always avoided it as much as it would allow itself to be, but i am not scared of it anymore. 
i am open to it and i hope i will remain open to embrace whatever changes life has planned for me. 
i do not want to fear the future. i dot not want to fear myself and i do not want to fear the reality of fleeting moments. 

some people that know me well will agree that i live in the past more often than anyone ever should. i miss things. i miss experiences and people. i miss childhood and adolescence. and i must accept that those times are gone, but not lost; are in the past, but not forgotten. 
i have wasted the present dwelling on days gone by. it is causing me to miss my future before it ever happens. 

the future will not wait for me to say i'm ready. the future will not stall as i gather myself and close beautiful doors leading to unforgettable memories. it is time to seal those entrances and cross the threshold of my future. i take comfort in the truth that i will always hold the key with me, should i ever need to return."

i think it was time. time for final goodbyes. final morning calls, and final shoulder sharing sob stories. things will come together from here on out. they just had to finally fall apart first. 
things are good. i am happy. nervous and excited, but content. 

my mission now is to discover if what ive suspected all along is true. should it be, im not sure what ill do. and if it isnt, im sure i will be relieved of much internal confusion.

beauty. in its truest form. that one would wait. that one would die for the love of another. 
sometimes i close my eyes and i can see you. i can see perfection. we smile. 
there is no past to remember and no future to forget.
only the innocence of that exact moment. 
and you hold me. 
you feel me as i feel you. 
as you take every part of me, i slip into unconsciousness and am lost in an entrancing euphoria. 
passion so intense i am moved to uncontrollable tears. 
all of my emotion is condensed into one and is released with one enrapturing moment that defines my soul.

my eyes are opened. perfection has passed. but it has not died.
it is immortal. as is my love.
and i can still feel you taking me. 

i cannot stop crying. and it has not stopped raining."

you are asking me to give you something i am uncapable of. i would loving nothing so much as to ease your mind and allow you to let go. but i cant. i cant without lying to you and i cant without deceiving myself. 
the truth is i am afraid to reveal the truth to you. it is true that you have loved me unconditionally throughout the most trying times of both of our lives, but i fear the truth will be more than you can handle. 
you will become outraged, embarassed, and far more confused than you are at this moment. and yet, you are begging me to do that. 
i wish to fulfill your desires, but how can i? knowing the greater burdens i will be placing on you? the heavier crosses. you will feel as if i have tightened my grip around your living neck and refused to let go. 
i cannot do that to you.

i told you that what you know right now, leaves you without the slightest hint of understanding why i am unable to commit to a decision. and this is true. if you trust nothing else involving me, trust this one thing. believe me when i say, that if i was able to make a decision, i would. and your life as well as mine would be seemingly simple and sincere. and as soon as this opportunity reveals itself to me, i will reveal to you what you have been begging for. until then, i am sorry. 
you ask something that is not possible. and i am able to see more than you, and i know that for the time being -- the decision to remain indecisive is the most appropriate for the both of us, but mainly for you."

will it work? should it work? should i avoid the inevitable pain of a broken heart? should i avoid breaking your heart and breaking your purity?

everything happens for a reason you say? well explain this to me please. my mind is hurting  and my heart is growing weary from this constant battle. dear, allow my heart to rest. allow my thoughts to know peace and security. 

pain is not something i intend to place on you. and if i shall, please forgive me.

"event","everyone has a past. 



some are more proud of theirs than others. there are those blessed few that smile when remembering and replaying their own personal story. there are the strong individuals that have composed a spectacular symphony of memories and stories. they have carefully chosen every individual note and they have surrounded themselves with musicians as precise and talented and consistent as themselves. 

i have not accomplished such a task. the songs that i have written are many times unpleasant to the ear and damaging to the imagination. but they are my songs. original works of art created through tears and frustration. scribbled with shaky hands and drunken mistakes. 
but they are beautiful. they tell a wonderful story.

everyone has a past. 

everyone has a symphony, a defining orchestration that has the ability to exonerate even the most hardened of individuals. 
it is a sad day when those lyrical ballads have no audience to entertain. it is a shameful reflection of the human nature--- that tendency to only accept that which is familiar and safe. 
we shall have no right to judge an individual based on what is presently seen by our human eyes. we must listen. listen to the songs they have written. listen to the notes that have been chosen and the chords that have somehow chosen themselves despite vigorous protest. 

there is no greater form of acceptance than to listen to and truly hear the anthem of another. to shed honest tears for sorrow-filled melodies and sounds of innocent desparation. to hear without judgment of neither the past nor the present, another's honest story. 

i embrace my past. and the past of everyone around me. and as long as we continue to do so, our futures promise to deliver the most glorious symphonies ever heard."

"event","imagining my life without you is terrifying. however, it is time for me to say goodbye. to close the door and to stop allowing you to defeat me. to control me, and to hinder me.
nine years. for nine years i have allowed you to make every decision. to decide my moods. to determine the extent to which i am able to feel emotion. if you allow any emotion at all. you have kept me from experiencing love. you have scarred my thoughts and you have broken my integrity. 
i am shameful. i despise myself for allowing you so much power. from the moment i was introduced to you, you haved paralyzed my every muscle, my every thought. i have not been allowed to experience life in the same way that those around me do. and i hate you for that. 
i hate you for hurting others through me. i hate you for hiding the real person, my true self, from my own and others. 

before i leave you, before i pick up my cross, before i can become alive again, i want to thank you. thank you for the many experiences i have had due to you. though i have been cheated of happiness and purity because of you, i have also seen honesty in its truest form. i have felt true despair and i have felt the hatred that i have deserved. and i thank you. that hatred, that shame allows me to see that it is not me that believes those behaviors and actions. it is not me that allows total defeat. it is who you have made me into. and she is no longer stronger than me. i cannot allow her to control my thoughts and fears. i am not scared of losing you anymore. 
she is, but i am not her. and i hate her. i wont let myself die to you. 
my ashes may be plenty and their story is great. and i will rise higher from them than i ever have before. through her death i can live again, and i can love again. i can feel again."

i also have been seriously considering abstaining from alcohol for an extended period of time, as in a week or two weeks. just to see how i react, mentally and physically. actually, i was advised to do it, and i have been very unsuccessful thus far. but i have gotten a little better, a little more able to control and maintain. 
its especially hard when those around you are not struggling with the same problem and they find it hard to understand why you are trying to do such a  thing. it is so hard to let go of. 
just like a best friend, or a lifelong pet, or the house you grew up in. its familiar. its comfortable. its the only thing that has remained constant in your life. how could you give it up?? and why would you give it up? it has never failed you. 
i wish i was strong enough to fail it. to desert it. to run away and never turn back. 
hopefully i will be one day.

i dont know what it will take, you would think i would have learned already. i mean, its caused enough pain and hurt to both others and myself that i should hate the thought of it. yet it never leaves my mind."

i finally got to see him. and even talk to him. i couldnt really believe it. i cried pretty much the whole time but i got to talk to him. 
it was wonderful. it wasnt planned and it took me off gaurd but i was happy to fall. 
and even if he doesnt ever call me or talk to me again, as someone made it clear to me that he wont, im still so happy i got to see him before i leave or he leaves. 
i miss him. 
and him. and him. 

i cant believe how stupid i could be. i cant believe what i let go. ive ruined it. all of it. the past 2 years are gone and so is he. even the friendship. i hurt him. and ill admit its my fault. 
im still convinced i will never find anyone like him again. what an amazing person. i dont deserve his friendship anyway. 

im not trying to feel sorry for myself. i just wish things were different. so different. 

its ironic that the things that have caused any unhappiness in my life are the things i crave to do the most. and the same things that i cant let go of. and the one thing that truly gave me happiness, i push away and and lose forever."

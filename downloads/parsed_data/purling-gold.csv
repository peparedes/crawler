Reallllllllllllly high fives to my Chicago budheads. Leap, fuckers, leap with all the joy pulsating through your bodies!!

Wow, the White Sox are definitely a worthy team. So many good plays, so brutal in this war of attrition with the Astros. Lucky Sox. Lucky.

Now, Lidge... :(

I definitely see a momentum in me toward baseball."

"event","So, more luck has come whirling into my life. My mom found out Friday night that she has 3 tickets. One was supposed to be for my brother. He preferred to stay in South Carolina. Thus the decision came to me for whom would scurry with me into the World Series game. 

Therefore... Mark, <lj user=""stuntedparadise"">, you crazy southsider, welcome to my sphere of luck. :-P"

"event","Called the teacher at his home after he didn't reply to my email for so long. Explained the situation. He enthusiastically agreed to me missing the exam Monday.

So, fellows, you'll be seeing me along the thousands in the Sunday World Series game. 

Tonight: Gallaudet.

Sunday: Chicago."

"event","So I might be going to the World Series game on Sunday in Chicago to see my cousin wage WAR against the Pale Stockings. 

Only obstacle? A goddamned exam at 10 am Monday in my German class. I'm seeing if I can get out of it, postpone it, and I'll be hitting the road Saturday to intrude Chicago once again. An email has been fired toward his ass.

If the teacher's belligerent enough to say no, then I hit Gallaudet tomorrow night. 

Either way, this weekend will be a win."

"event","I found out today that the Simpsons is based on Nuke school.  apparently Matt Groening was a navy nuke (Electronics Technician, just like me.)  Mr. Burns is modeled after Admiral Rickover (the father of the nuclear navy), and Ned Flanders is based on a civilian contractor that attended the school.  Homer is a pneumonic acronym for something Ill find out about at prototype.  now every time I see a picture of Adm. Rickover in the school building (of which there are many) I picture him tenting his fingers and saying ""Excellent...""
whenever I ask about what Ill be doing out in the fleet, Im always told Ill be sitting in front of a panel of guages and meters, making sure they dont move.  and I always imagined myself sitting in Homers chair, kicking my feet up and trying not to spill soda on the circuitry.  I had no idea how close to the truth that was until now."

"event","its been a very physically intensive 18 hours.  yesterday I had to do PT with the other navy recruits at the rec center, including swimming nonstop for 45 minutes, 100 pushups, running about half a mile, and these horrible things called butterfly kicks and ab blasters. (no, not an alcoholic beverage with jaeger and red bull.)  after which, I found out I was going to have to meet with my recruiter today at 0900 (zero nine hundred) (9am) to give him my contact info so he could pick me up on sunday.  after which, I somehow got talked into swimming laps at 6 in the morning.

normally, Id still be squinting, and swearing at the bright sunrise, and grumbling complaints as I slouch from place to place aimlessly like the undead I loathe so much.  but that girl Cally is right.  working out in the morning really puts the rest of your day through a rose colored filter.  considering I only got about 2 hours of sleep last night, I feel sharp and energetic.  but well see if it lasts.

they had a proper diving facility at the aquatic center.  not up to olympic standards with diving platforms, but they did have a 3 meter board, and they all had adjustable spring, unlike the single board at the rec center.  it was fun being able to dive off a 3m board again after a decade, and I even learned a new dive.  actually, I learned 2, but the spiderman dive isnt allowed in competitions I believe.  (you lay on the board, holding onto the sides, and flip over the front so youre hanging off by your hands, then you pull your feet up to the bottom of the board and push off and dive into the water.)  the other was a reverse 1 1/2.  (jump off the board facing forward, and do 1.5 backflips.)  I only got 3 shots at it tho, because the last one busted the zipper off my shorts, and I had to contain myself as I sidestepped my way to the locker room.  so until I get a new suit, my diving career is on hiatus.

"event","tonight I played poker with my dad and a couple of his friends from work, and lady luck was sitting on my lap and doing naughty things with my cards.  Ive always lost at poker before, and was expecting to have fun losing $10 at nickel and dime ante games, but ended up walking away with an extra $30 in my pocket.  talking shit to people can get kind of awkward when youre actually winning...  Ive always done it on the short stack of chips in the past.  now I dont know whether I just got lucky, or if my friends I always played with before were really good.  I guess Ill find out next weekend.

in the same vein, last night we stopped at a liquor store/bar/casino to pick up some beer, and I played video poker for the 1st time.  I spent $5 on the machine, losing it all, but got 3 free beers out of the deal, so I like to think I won in the end.  when I was at the casino in CO, I spent $50 before I could even get one free drink off the house.  but back at lucky lil's, the casino down the street, my dad's girlfriend Linda and I also tried the oxygen bar they had there.  $3 to breathe 10 mins. worth of scented air...  it smelled nice, but I doubt it can do all the miracle remedy things it promised, like curing hangovers and improving bowel movements.  and if you can believe it, the slogan for the oxygen bar was: ""sexy for the mind, healthy for the body.""  I can honestly tell you, I didnt feel very sexy, with 5 feet of plastic tubing wrapped around my head, and from the looks I was getting, the girls in the place weren't feeling it either.

I love gambling.  I have a feeling if I lived in NV, Id actually have an addiction.  Ive always wanted one of those;  they can be very fashionable in the some crowds."

""You've got mail!""
    Startled, Robbie Dunkirk quickly hides his gameboy and begins clacking noisily on the keyboard in front
of him, before he realises he is still alone in the com lab.  sighing, Robbie casually clicks on the icon
of the overflowing mailbox and begins reading the contents of the le-

    opening his eyes, Robbie finds himself staring at the ceiling.  as his senses once again swirl into his
head, Robbie wonders if this impossible, nagging memory could be true.  rereading the message once again, while at the same time biting his lower lip to prevent another fainting spell, he finds his memory served him regrettfully true, and breaks out of the com lab at a dead sprint.

    Josh Hoffstatter winds his right leg thru the precariously balanced mass of feminine limbs w/ a feline's grace.  just as his big toe registers on the green circle, his intercom buzzes on.  ""Rev., there is a young man here who urgently reque-""  just then a flustered youth bursts thru the door, spouting nonsense in the proper vernacular of Josh's own creation, causing a deluge females to come toppling down on Josh's head.

    ""Reverend, i have just recieved a most dire report from Agent Inquisitor!""

    quickly composing his regal composure, Josh bids the young man to continue w/ a nod.

    ""perhaps, your worship, it would be better not to discuss such disturbing matters in front of the women...""  tho Josh had no reason to believe women had any lower tolerances to shock than the young man before him, he dismissed them, pending they took the twister mat along w/ them.  Josh prefered to have as few people as possible present while he made his xecutive decisions anyways.  ""Sir, Agent Inquisitor has managed to infiltrate a hidden laboratory, where... where..."" biting back tears, the youth continued.  ""where our most sacred of icons are forced to engage in perverted and blasphemous acts of, a
sexual nature!""  whereupon the youth could no longer stifle his passion, and began weeping like a little
bitch.  a distant look of deep consideration spread across Josh's countenance, and detatchedly xclaimed,
""have your full report to my secretary by happy hour.  leave me.""  as soon as the doors to his study were
shut, Josh was seized by uncontrollable fits of laughter, as situations such as these began Josh pondering the wiley and ingenious beginnings...

    Josh of 12:  i dont wanna eat my vegetables!
    Mother:  at least 2 bites.  veggies are good for
             you, and make you grow big and strong.
    Josh: (quickly) its against my religion.
    Mother:  dont be ridiculous.  now eat!
    Josh: no really.  (shuffling thru list of trivial 
                       facts in brain)  brussel 
          sprouts are a cruciferous plant.  they died 
          for our sins.
    Mother: now, really Josh.  alright then, we have
            brocoli, too.
    Josh: (presenting encyclopedia) sorry, theyre 
          cruciferous too.

    at this, Josh's mother was defeated, as she was devoutly catholic and had no right to question providence.  Josh, spreading the word, slowly but surely gained the faith of avid vegetable haters across the country, and soon became the powerful demagogue he is today.  realizing these zealots would serve his every whim, Josh quickly seized the state of idaho, a boring but geographically ideal foothold from whence to conquer the entire pacific coast.  
    now, some of you might be thinking, ""an army of carnivores?  now really, these peoples blood pressure
would be so high and bodies so obese, they could barely climb a flight of stairs, much less overthrow
the American government.""  however, as Josh predicted such a possibility w/ his superior intellect, he
remedied such a situation more than satisfactorily.  w/ the xception of those who merited a spot in the
rotation of groundskeeping, the vast majority of his faithful congregation denounce idleness by whidling
monumental idols of his likeness out of the rocky mountains, resulting in a populace of hurculean proportions.  as the Mexicans ravaged the south, those ill-fated souls who were unlucky enough to blunder
into California were quickly and brutally massacred.   thus is born an empire.
    tho Josh would have normally showed this ""Green-House of Ill-Repute"" no more consideration, he inferred that word had probably spread thru the provinces like a fervid brush-fire, and his integrity
depended crucially on his front of the passionate evangelist.  rallying his troops, Josh lead his militia of statuesqe, post-apocolyptic, bondage clad gladiators and valkeries to descend upon the laboratory and purge it from the earth w/ divine retribution, freeing the sacred green martyrs his empire was founded on.
    however, as he approached the location betrayed to him by his mole, Josh found the lab ravaged, while a
swarm of cattle defiled the plantlife w/ their rabid mandibules.  aware of the equal mixture of rage and
hunger of his troops at the simultaneous register of blasphemy and the source of the victory barbeque, Josh
instilled a sense of divine right in the frenzied troops, as the Pseudo-Crusades were waged.

   will Josh's unzealous cause be discovered?  will his barbarions prevail against the overwhelming army
of steak and mutton?  who is the mole in Dr. Meghan's midst?  find out in the next installment of...
 THE GREAT VEGETABLE EPIC!!"

"event","look what I found in one of my email folders.  I figure this will make good filler since nobody seems to be posting lately.


so... World War III is upon us....

      ...the fields stretch out upon the mid-American plains.. vacant soil waiting to be tended.. I crouch to the ground and open my hand.  In it I had clutched the jewel of the earth: the emerald wars are waged for and the reason lives are lost.. the beautiful green broccoli seed radiates life and love in my hand..
  A few yards behind me, friends stand.  Large, glowing smiles grow on their faces, their eyes shimmer with hope and joy.  The broccoli plant will be sewn.  Harvest will soon bring new life and new vegetation to us all.  As I am about to release the life-giving seed into the vital earth, a dark shadow falls upon me.
  I look up, surprised and alert.  It is the shadow of evil.  A flag waves behind the figure before me - a flag displaying a vile and wretched plant...
  A Brussel Sprout.

The figure speaks, ""Ho'! Stay your hand you vile swine!  What thinkest thou! Do not tarnish the earth with your wretched plant!""

  * a sword comes close to my hand, I clench the broccoli seed tightly in my palm *
<Val>   ""WHO do you think you are?!"" I retort, jumping to my feet.

<Tim>- ""I am Tim, the general of the Brussel Sprout Strike Force.  We will be your demise. Even now, the wheels are turning - soon fields of brussel sprouts will spread out before us miles long.  Broccoli will not flourish in this world.""

<Val>* ""You Vile fiend!  Can we not plant Broccoli and Brussel sprouts 
side by side?"" This is said while reaching my hand to shake that of my foe's in a friendly gesture ""I am Valerie of the Broccoli SSF""

<Tim>- ""HAHAHA"" He laughs, retracting his hand as if we were in elementary school. ""bah humbug...peaceful agreements for the weak and boring Val...no guts, no glory""

<Val>*Growls with the knowledge that a largescale world war is about to ensue* *puts on her sunglasses*  ""just call me don val'rio"" she says.

  Now the truth is known. The Broccoli SSF is truly the Broccoli Sniper Strike Force. Still.. Tim is not shaken.

<Tim>- ""ha, as if you have sunglasses..""

<Val>* *cries*

<Val>*looks down* ""...ok so i dont have sunglasses but that doesnt mean i'm not tough and intimidating.."" *kicks the dirt*... :<

<Tim>-*cringes in the corner*
<Tim>-""heeeeeeeeey...that dirt...is..umm...dirty, watch it you big meanie!""

<Val>*regains some of her fear-instilling stature*  NYAH!

<Tim> *raises the white flag*

<Val> ""wow.. that didnt even involve third world countries!""

<Tim> *aims the flagpole at Val, grips the trigger, and orders an immediate surrender*
<Tim> ""haha"" he grimaces wickedly ""...first casualty of war is the truth""

<Val> ""HOLY SHIT!""
<Val> *Val pushes a button on her DrSeuss watch and disappears into her ultra-topsecret underground spy base*
<Val> ""ANOTHER DAY!!! ANOTHER DAY!!!!""

Now... the war has been waged.. the sides have been staked.. and alleigances have been sworn.   Who will strike first?  Where has Val gone into hiding and when will she return?  Will Tim have time to plant the evil Brussel Sprout seed of doom?  Will Broccoli forever go extinct?  Will there be a harvest?  ...perhaps just a harvest of corpses?  The war has begun.  What side will you take?
*DUNDUNDUN*
-Val!
shut up.


what will happen next?  tune in tomorrow to find out!  same broccoli time, same broccoli channel!"

"event","'evening all!  tonights update is being brought to you from Great Falls, Montana.  I got up here friday, after having driven w/ my dad through a (literal) snowstorm.  there was surprisingly only one accident along the way which we saw, luckily not 1sthand.  1 semi had rear-ended another semi, tearing open a trailer like aluminum, and folding a car carrier in half.  I didnt see any ambulances, so I can say with a clear conscience that it was a pretty cool wreck.  I finally got to play in the snow after a month of being around it, as I was able to borrow winter gear from my dad.  he had hooked up a tobbogan to his 4 wheeler, and dragged me through fields and down the back roads around his house.  that was fun except tobbogans dont really have any steering mechanisms, so going around a few corners I got flipped into the snow and sent skidding along behind, snow being scooped up under my jacket and shirt.  I even wore a ski mask similar to the one on my counterstrike icon.  I got my computer hooked up to the internet last night, and dusted off trillian, which I found hiding under a stack in my programs folder.  so if anyone would like to chat, Im usually on around this time (between 12 and 2 de la manana).  aim=diezombiescum  icq=53986946  and yahoo, when it actually connects=thearcticavenger.

blech.  I hate writing update entries in my lj.  I can never seem to put the same literary flair into them that goes into my introspective or critical posts.  or maybe I could, if I stretched each narrative into a few pages of text.  but that would take more patience than I have right now, so this is what youre stuck with.

I was so disoriented by the rollercoaster of emotions I was pulled onto, I actually wanted to watch it just to feel better.  as much as I like Hughes movies, I think from now on Ill stick to Spike and TechTV, where the ads only make me want to buy beer and video games, rather than cry into a box of tissues and stuff myself with candy.  the things girls will put up with..."

"event","earlier today I saw the garbage truck pull up next to the trash can, and expected to see someone jump off the back and empty the can.  but lo, instead a giant robot arm folds out of the side, grabs the can, and turns it upside down into the top of the truck.  I love watching robots at work.  especially robots that could crush a minivan into one of those ridiculously small european clown cars.  europeans sure are dumb.  Id never drive a car I could fit in my backpack.

  but I digress.  Im not writing about how much I hate europeans.  Im writing about how much I love robots.  so the robot arm sets the can back on the ground, and I notice the lid is left hanging open.  ""well, robots cant be perfect yet,"" I think to myself, until the arm reaches down, flips up the lid, and pats it closed before retracting.  now I want one.  I dont know where Id attach it to, but with something that cool, Id find somewhere.  preferably it would be attached to my shoulder, but then Id probably fall over from the weight.  unless I got one on the other side too.  but then Id be to heavy to move, so Id need hydraulic robot legs.  now that I think about it, it would probably be easier to just transplant my brain into a cyborg body.  or download my brain onto a flash memory card which can be inserted into a cyborg body...  the future sure is going to be great.  Alien: Resurrection already promised me a Wynona Ryder android, so Im saving my pennies now for when the Wayland/Yutani Corporation subsidises.

  but back to the here and now...  I got a membership at the rec center down the street, so I have something to do now.  I figure getting into shape is better than sitting around all day watching tv, but the jurys still out on that one.  Ive been running about 4 miles a day, then lifting weights until I cant move.  they also have a pool, and Ive been able to practice my diving again.  Its only been about 15 years.  luckily I found my bathing suit, because I dont think there is anywhere in wyoming in december to buy another one.  hey, its snowing outside.

  You never really know how much you love Texas until you end up in Wyoming.  I still feel like Im only visiting, rather than moving in.  Maybe that will change tomorrow when my stuff gets here.

I only managed to watch a few minutes of it before becoming thoroughly disgusted.  I suppose what did it for me was when that ingenuous brittish chap told one of the girls ""youre not the best singer here, but you are the most commercial.""  and she thanked him for saying that...
I suppose that really sums up the essence of the the show for me... its not really about talent, not ultimately; its about how well you fit the generic stereotype of what marketing agents think will appeal to the largest consumer demographic this season.  and of course we all know marketing agents are never wrong... I mean, to get back at the matter at hand, lets take a look at the show.  it draws more washed up flashes in the pan than and entire seasons worth of vh1s where are they now.  tonight we were 'graced' by the presence of on of the members of earth wind and fire, and jewel.  jewel, for gods sake!  and whatever happened to that girl that won last year?  I think I saw her singing in a halftime show or something... what do you suppose her future holds?  commercial jingles for used car lots?  grand opening appearances at local shopping centers?

"event","I dont know why, but Ive been listening to the new Apoptygma Berzerk cd a lot lately.  I bought it about a year ago, and listened to it once before banishing it to an eternity of collecting dust in the dungeon of the cd tower.  and about half the songs I only listened to the 1st minute or so before skipping to the next.

  I have a remix of the song 'until the end of the world' that I like, but I didnt like the original on the cd.  then a few months ago, I saw the music video for it.  it wasnt anything special as far as music videos go; half of it was the band playing in the desert, the other half was the yin side of an asian girl chasing her yang side through the crowded streets of chinatown.  or maybe its little china.  either way, nothing that special.  I also saw the video for suffer in 'silence', which was even more mundane.  the band was driving around the desert in a busted-up oldsmobile.

  notice a theme?  yes, the desert motif is appropriate, as most of the 'harmonizer' cd is about a lost relationship.  but then so was the last cd, 'welcome to earth.'  well, half of it was anyway.  the other half was about UFOs.  however, in 'welcome to earth' (the beginning of the break-up) Stephan was resigned and accepting of the resolution, and in some cases even bitter.  the songs in 'harmonizer', on the other hand,  are the sad, desparate graspings at any shred of hope of reconciliation.

  but back to the story.  so after seeing the videos a couple of times, the desire to listen to the entire cd slowly crept over me.  not all at once mind you, or else I would have dismissed it quickly and never thought of it again.  but after a few weeks had passed, I was in the mood to listen to something different, and scanning the rack I came across the accursed cd, and decided to pop it in.  its like fucking crack, I tells ya!  all it takes is one hit...

  I dont want to like this cd.  its all dance-y and pop-y, and despite the subject matter, is chock-full of up-beat and happy melodies that subconsiously coax you into singing along like some mindless, drug-filled candy-flipping automaton.

""I need to forget
and make this tragic feeling go

  and I swear, if 'suffer in silence' was played with guitars and a human drummer, it could be a Good Charlotte or Blink-182 song.  .grumble. fucking so-cal punk... .grumble.

  oh yeah.  the title of this entry is the name of one of the songs.  I personally endorse photoshop and the use of its many pirated incarnations.<sup>&#134;</sup>  the song, by the way, has nothing to do with photoshop.  theres also a song called 'pikachu', which has nothing to do with pikachu, and a song called 'rollergirl', featuring samples which I am unable to determine if they are a female sighing happily or moaning ecstatically.

  the reason I began this entry, oh so long ago, was to state that my computer is up and running.  I am, in fact, typing this entry on it as I speak (or type, rather...)  Walker has just finished building a new system himself, and was kind enough to lend me one of his hard disks while I order mine, since he will have to reformat it anyways.  (I have a hard disk drive, along with a network card, in the mail.)  the only things I really have on my computer so far are games and internet, as I am going to have to erase it and start over in a few days.  when I have a permanent home for my programs, Ill pirate me a copy of photoshop<sup>&#135;</sup> and make some fun user icons and probably build a blog-style web page that I can personalise better than lj.

  I think to compensate for listening to the new Apop so much lately Ive also been playing my Atari Teenage Riot cd a lot.  I like Atari Teenage Riot.  theyre angry, theyre always yelling about joining the revolution, even though they never really state what to revolt against, they sing about online multi-player 1st-person shooters, and they steal guitar samples from bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols.  wow, I just re-read that last sentence, and realized it could be used to describe myself.  except that I dont steal guitar samples... yet...

  instead, I try poking at the bios to detect it, to no avail.  then I open it up, rewire the IDE ribbon about 12 times, also to no avail.  then I loot a hard drive off the carcass of another computer lying in my room and try that.  same error msg.

"event","Eskimos have dozens of words for ice.  (I dont remember the exact number offhand.)  why?  because there are dozens of types of ice.  the hard-packed slush and snow that covers the ground.  the kind thats 5 feet thick on top of lakes that you could drive a truck over.  the kind thats half an inch thick on top of lakes that would drop you to a watery death if you stepped on it. the constantly flowing glaciers on the horizon the size of mountains.  ice is something eskimos deal with on a daily basis.  their conversations would be very vague and their descriptions long winded if they only used 'ice'.  it would be like trying to have a conversation about 'love'.
  supposedly we are a relatively advanced culture.  we understand the macrocosm around us and the microcosm within us to a greater detail than Socrates or DaVinci ever dreamed.  We have such a complex understanding of human emotions that our cliches would be Freud's epiphanies.  and yet we have the most powerful, most inspirational, most painful, and most abused amalgamation of ideas confined within one cryptic word.  a man can describe his preference for a particular brand of pork rinds and his affection for his wife with the same convenient word.  a woman can lie to a friend about her new hairstyle as well as express her solely validating passion of creating music with that one oily word.
  it is a verb and a noun.  with a little modification it can become an adjective or adverb.  it is simultaneously the most substantial and most superficial word in our language.
  time to pick up Belinda from class.  sigh.  I watched Pretty in Pink earlier today, and was planning on ranting about Hughes.  Im noting it here so I wont forget.
  btw, the quote is from a Violent Femmes song, featuring guest vocals by Bruce Campbell."

"event","scanning a list of famous last words, you will find many eloquent reflections, as well as pearls of wisdom cultivated over decades of numerous extraordinary lives.  but these quotes are taken from the lips of some of the best versed authors and poets of history, who had months, possibly even years to sculpt the words that would be forever preserved as their ultimate message.
  however, there have been a few famous figures whose deaths had been so tragic and unforseen as to prevent anything but the purest of emotions from pouring out in their last breaths.  most notably, Julius Caesar's final exclamation, ""et tu, Brute?""
  Julius Caesar was betrayed, and butchered by an entire room of his closest advisors and friends.  and among them, the one person he trusted, and loved above all else.
  if you check your statistics, youll find the most frequently uttered final quote to be ""shit.""  while not nearly as erudite as that of the great Caesar, obscenities in our language describe a wide variety emotions, none of them felt lightly.  I would go so far as to say they are used more passionately than the words ""I love you"" by all but a discouragingly small number of people.  feelings of betrayal, of disillusionment, of rage and bitter disengagement encompassed in their entirety by one word, without trivializing the magnitude of any of them.
  the more passionate the moment, the more abridged ones vocabulary becomes.  its only upon reflection that the feelings can be specified, can be quantified.  when the emotions overwhelm you so entirely, theres little else you can say.
  the one person he trusted, and loved above all else..."

"event","Belinda kicked Allens car.  we came over to pick up Val and go see a movie, and Allens car was here (Im still at the house.)  so yeah, she jumped out of the car and stomped it pretty good.  and yeah, I thought it was pretty funny.  but the best part was when we went inside everyone had seen Belinda kick Allens car.  he was already fairly uncomfortable as Ness was there, but that chased him off.  and guiltily, Ill admit it was fun to watch him squirm.  I felt bad for him for a split second, but then I remembered seeing him and Val together, and what an ass he was.  and all was chipper again.  so now were in this awkward state between picking up Val and picking up a movie.  more as it happens..."

"event","Elizabeth and I just got back from colorado.  we had spent the week skiing.  I was snowboarding.  it was great.  it was just like on those commercials you see for the resorts with the people tearing down the mountainsides and flying over cliffs and whatnot.  except with a lot more falling.  and less flying over things.  and the runs I went down were less steep.  to be honest, there wasnt really any flying over anything.  but it was still really fun.  I actually picked it up pretty quick, and was taking on some blue runs by the 3rd day.
  remember the subject line, from that part in the nightmare before xmas?  when the guy hammers the dead animal flat and poofs it into a hat and sports it like the work of art it is?  we saw a woman who had done something hideously similar with a dog.  we were finishing up eating at one of the lodges and were about to leave when we noticed a woman who seemed to be holding a fuzzy white lapdog.  upon closer inspection, the dog was a lot floppier than was healthy.  just then, when our curiousity had peaked (or is it piqued?) she stuck the thing on her head.  it was as though she had taken a pomeranian, cut it open at the stomach, and scooped out the innards.  the legs were dangling around her ears.  the worst part was, besides the organs and skeletal structure, it was still entirely intact.  it even had the paw pads and claws and teeth on it.  we wondered, what the hell was wrong with this woman?  had it been a favored pet she couldnt bear to part with?  ugh.  people are fffucked up.
  when we wre in this poster/tshirt store in breckenridge, spiderman was on the tvs arranged throughout the store.  the 1st time I watched the movie, I was paying careful attention to discover if Bruce Campbell was in it.  I knew if I were Sam Raimi, Id throw a cameo to the chin that launched my career.  and in that store, Elizabeth pointed at a wrestling announcer on the screen and proclaimed, ""hey, its Bruce Campbell.""  and sure enough, hidden behind an enormous pair of shades and a carnival barkers voice was that great ham, the Ego known as Bruce Campbell.
  that about does it for tonight.  time to pass out and sleep for a considerable chunk of tomorrow.
  merry whatever to all, and to all an etc. etc."

Ive had one decent nights sleep since before thanksgiving break began.  I thought Id get to sleep today since I didnt have to work, but it seems the fates' sense of humor is entirely too similar to mine...

Josh was dreaming, happily drooling on his arm;
When behold!  the klaxon of the fire alarm!
After falling into clothing to face harsh winter air,
He grabs purple poptarts and stumbles downstair.
But alas, after spiraling 4 dizzying flights down,
Josh meets returning students who turn him around.
As he ascends the foul staircase, musky and steep,
He finds he'd have been happier to burn in his sleep.

;)  I rarely catch myself waxing poetic, but I suppose anyone can be moved by the right subject matter..."

"event","attempt #2.  I wrote something resembling this post earlier today, but didnt copy the text before posting.  of course it didnt go through and my post was eaten.  redoing things that were done correctly the 1st time is so frustrating...
  I guess the 1st item of interest is that I got a job at the blimpies/baskin robbins in san marcos.  its a pretty easy job, killing time being the hardest thing I need to do.  I spend that time sampling (gorging myself on) icecream.  as I am typing this, I can already forsee certain friends of mine (Belinda) coming into the store with the intent of mockery, or even attempting to get me in trouble with my managers.  however, any such individual(Belinda) should be warned; you will be quickly pelted with 31 flavors of projectiles.
  thanksgiving was spent at Elizabeth's grandparents' house in dallas.  they were fun in a quirky kind of way... (or was it quirky in a fun kind of way?)  regardless, dinner was good, my only complaint being there was no gravy.  hopefully Ill make it back to my house before all the leftovers are gone.
  cant really think of anything else, so I guess the abridged version will have to suffice."

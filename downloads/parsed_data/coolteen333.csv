"event","Hey guys. Today was alright besides the fact the devil came to my house. MY AUNT JEANIE!!!! AHHHHH!! Anyway, my cousin (Jen) got in a car wreck and left the car here. Well today the repair man came, so Jeanie and Jen had to come to my house. We'll it wasn't that bad. She does'nt seem to have anything against me, thank god. Well anyway, last night I spent the night at Casey's. It was fun, i felt bad for Casey though, with his stones and all (get well soon man). But yeah, i had to come home early in the morning to wait for the arrival of ""The Aunt"" as mom would say. Oh, did i say i was the only one home when they came? Yeah, the rest of my family went to Jacksonville to go to a museum (however you spell it) and then they went to CHUCK E CHEESE'!!! YEAH I KNOW, SOUND AWSOME!! But not for me :( . But anyway, thats about it, my cousins car is fized and I'm home alone, ayone wanna come over? lol, anyway, im out. Peace. -K Man"

"event","hey everyone, well yesterday wasn't the best of days, but isn't wasn't the worst either. I woke up around 2, got on Warcraft, called Christina and got owned in our first game. HATE!!! But we won a few after that but we were super devastated after our loss. No worries though, we're still 31-3. BUT, in 4v4 we're gonna rock!!! We just gotta wait for Christina to get her game. After playing, dad called and asked me to roll silverware at the Roadhouse, GAH! It wasn't too bad, i guess you could call it dad's fathers day present. but thats no excuse, i still need a present for him, any ideas? Anyway, rolling silverware wasnt bad, but my back hurt after standing and repeating the rolling process for three hours. But after work, dad and I went to Hooters (Ahh the memory's) and got some wings to take home. We then watched ""Kiss The Girl"", not a bad movie, then i called Christina and went to bed. So Yeah, nothing too exciting to talk about. So for now, goodbye fellow ninja's! -K dizzle"

"event","There was this little boy about 12 years old walking down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. He came up to the doorstep of a house of ill repute and knocked on the door.

When the Madam answered it, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted.

He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money to buy it, and I'm not leaving until I get it.""

The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked.

He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?"" Of course the Madam said no. He said, ""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making love with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want.""

Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him.

Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door.

The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?""

He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with a baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of cute little boys. She will then get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitter's, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, and HE'S the son-of-a-bitch who ran over my FROG."""

"event","Two Arabs boarded a flight out of London. One took a window seat and the other sat next to him in the middle seat. Just before takeoff, an Israeli sat down in the aisle seat.

After takeoff, the Israeli kicked his shoes off, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the Arab in the window seat said, ""I need to get up and get a coke.""

Don't get up,"" said the Israeli, ""I'm in the aisle seat; I'll get it for you.""

As soon as he left, one of the Arabs picked up the Israeli's shoe and spat in it. When he returned with the coke, the other Arab said, ""That looks good, I'd really like one, too."" Again, the Israeli obligingly went to fetch it. While he was gone the other Arab picked up his other shoe and spat in it.

When the Israeli returned, they all sat back and enjoyed the flight.

As the plane was landing, the Israeli slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.

""Why does it have to be this way?"" he asked. ""How long must this go on? This fighting between our nations? This hatred? This animosity? This spitting in shoes and peeing in cokes?"""

"event","My unit's Dr. lady-person gave me some sleeping pills to test out. Basically that if I have side effecst, like say...they tear up my insides and make me wish I were dead or something, it'd be better to find that out here instead of over there. Damn shame is, I got little sleep last night, I'm listening to calming music (Damien Rice), <i>and</i> I took sleeping pills. Forty something odd minutes of laying in bed, nope, still awake.


I guess sleeping pills have no effect on me. Lame.

"event","I went to my first military funeral Thursday. After a deployment people are usually allowed a week of non-chargeable leave, meaning it's not counted against there vacation days. This crew chief got into a car accident while home after Iraq. So he survives a war zone, only to get killed while home. That sucks on so many levels.

Anywho, I didn't know this guy so I wasn't sad beyond the, ""I feel for his family"" type of sadness. But still, the memorial service was heartwrenching. It's probably because I'm enlisted that I find military memorials the saddest. I guess because there's this quiet dignity about them. I don't think I can explain it.

The chilling part is when they had everyone outside and they started playing ""Taps."" That is such a hauntingly beautiful song. It's always been one of my favorites. Especially in Basic, 'cuz that meant I could go to sleep. But I digress, we were outside standing at attention when you could see the honor gaurd standing with their rifles. Even though you knew what was about to happen you still couldn't help but jump when they fired, and I honestly doubt the reason peopled jumped was just because of the sudden loud noise. There's a huge difference in just hearing a rifle shoot and hearing one fire in a 21-gun salute.

And then ""Amazing Grace"" on bagpipes is surprisingly beautiful. I hate bagpipes except for that song.


Gah, I hate thinking about death and all that is involved"

Me: No,  this ticket's already going to hurt, I don't know.

Her: Good. That ticket probably saved your life.

Me: ???

Her: I had this terrible feeling this morning that you were going to get killed because you drove too fast. That's why I kept telling you to be careful.

"event","Man, I am bitching and moaning about today. Ok, so far this week I have been playing ""survivor"" for some mission with our unit and the Pjs. It's pretty fun. I get to see how things are like on the ground, I get to see some really pretty scenery, and I get to ride up into the helocopter on the hoist.

Except for today. I mean, I got to do all that stuff but it still sucked. Today, part of the scenario was where I had a broken femur and I was bleeding profusly. So I'm laying there, the Pj comes and asks me what's wrong. I tell him, he cuts open my leg, sees the wound (I had a maskthingywhatever) and places his knee on my theigh and puts ALL OF HIS WEIGHT. Now, I was called to pretend it hurt when they touched my leg. I didn't have to pretend. That hurt like bloody hell. 

Oh, it gets worse. They then decide that I need an IV. I hate needles. I hate needles with an undying passion. I hate needles more than... um...your mom. Why? Because they're sharp and pointy. Sharp and pointy and they're used to poke things, because they're sharp and pointy and they poke my skin and...uh...yeah. Anywho,

I start freaking out, see the last paragraph if you want to know why I freak out. But I try to be good. I honestly do. They were going to put it in my right arm, so I clentch my left hand, turn my head away, and I am very cogniscent of my breathing. I take great pains to breath slow and deep. In-out. In-out. In with the butterflies, out with the bees. I am holding on to my sanity by a thread. And then, poke. Next thing I know, I'm getting this tingly sensation all throughout my body. I start to tense up all over. Next thing I hear is ""Breath, don't freak out, don't freak out. Ok, he's freaking out. Pull the IV out. Scenerio's over. Call the 60s back in.""

So they pull the IV out and I start feeling a little bit better. They sit me up and start asking me questions. Who I am. What day it was. What I was doing etc. I knew it all, but I couldn't talk. My tounge would just not work. I couldn't open or close my hands either. It was like they were asleep, but a hundred times worse. It took about two minutes of struggling to get any movement back in there. Finally, once I could stand but up, I got hoisted back onto the helocopter and went home. My arms are barely not hurting anymore.

Today was fun."

"event","The last thing I need is another obsession. Oh well. Anywho, what I want to start doing is recording my grandparents, for a myriad of reason. For one is they've been around a few more years than I have, and I want to document all of their stories. About how things were when they were growing up, how they met, stuff about their parents and grandparents. I think that'd be cool. Also, they're getting old, and I want to provide a medium to help keep their memory around. I think I'll have fun with this little project.


I had my first fire today. We were starting up the engines when, well...something caught on fire. We put it out, but that helocopter was done for the night, so we had to rush and get another one ready. A tiring experience."

"event","""Watch 'The Notebook"" numerous people told me. ""It's such a sweet movie."" I heard on more than one occasion. So I did. I went to the store and bought it, assuming it would be a very good movie. And after the first time I saw it, I thought it was pretty good. It was sweet and all that jazz. 

But then I started thinking about it and I realized, that movie sucked. It was awful. It was laughable how they tried to make us sympathize with the main character even though she does not deserve sympathy nor respect. Allie did not deserve sympathy, Lon did. All he tried to do is give everything he mistakenly thought she deserved. And Allie, being the whore she was, goes on and cheats on Lon with an old flame, on the eve of their wedding at that. To say that it just happened is a bold-face lie. As soon as Allie stepped foot on Noah's property the die had been cast. She knew exactly what was going to happen, and she stayed. All blame rests on her shoulders.

After having lied to Lon about her whereabouts, after he catches up with her she's still trying to sweet talk him, make everything seem as if things are normal.


So all in all, ""the notebook"" was about a girl who whored it up. How sweet."

"event","My life is good. Anywho, it's been a while since I've updated and it's not really my fault. Ok, it's my fault. Wait, no I recant that. It's Angel's and Kristen's fault.

A few weeks ago, January 14th to be exact, I, in my infinite wisdom, decided I wanted to reformat my computer. I mean, it can't be <i>that</i> hard, can it? See, it wouldn't have been if I had any idea as to what I was doing. I am one of the most computer illiterate people ever, which is shocking seeing as how I'm a video game dork. Anyways, when I reformated, I got rid of EVERYTHING, which is the point of reformatting, but I somehow forgot to backup my drivers, and appearently without the drivers, nothign would work. No internet, and worse, because all my games requires a graphics card, so I couldn't play my games. I finally got things fixed on the 2nd of February. So that was nearly twenty days of no computer. I had to like, read and such. Oddly, I spent a lot of time sleeping.

Anyways, back to why it's Angel's and Kristen's fault. It is there fault because as my friends, they should have known I'm a idiot and would screw it up royally. Therefore, it is their job to protect stuff from me. It's like in the Bible or something.

Speaking of the Bible, I have snapped out of my phase, which is good, 'cuz I didn't like being in it.

That's all for now. Yay for me being happy!



Now all I need is a girlfriend."

Would you/what is
---------------------------------------

Eat a live hamster for $1,000,000? Wait, wait, wait...I could get paid to do that?

If you were stuck on an island, what people would you want with you?: 20 hot 18-22 year old female, blondes and brunettes.

Suicidal?: No. I'm not a little bitch. Everyone has their problems in life, but to take it is the coward's way out. That's why anyone who's suicidal should be shot. If they want to die, they should. I don't want to die, but I have a fairly good chance of dying because of what I do for a living. So if someone's all safe and such and they want to take their own life, then fuck them.

Yesterday morning I went to my Chem Warfare training then to a crapload of briefings at my squadron.

Where do you want to get married? In the perfect Catholic Church. And old mission would be awesome.

If you could change anything about yourself, what would it be? Too many to count. To start off: I wish I were smarter. Able to grasp concepts more easily. Stronger, better looking, smarter, smooth, gracefully, wish I could sing, prettier eyes, OMG I'd kill to have pretty eyes. Grey, blue, green. I want pretty eyes more than anything. Find a way to comunicate my emotions without becoming a train wreck. I've found ways to deal with them, but admittidly not the most healthy. Don't see me improving any times soon though.

I'm a damn good driver. It's those fucktards who drive slow who suck.

HA!

What do you dream about:

"event","I don't know why I'm feeling this way. I know there is a God, I know He loves me. I can't count on the many things that He's done for me and my family, but I can't shake this nagging feeling that I've had for that last couple of weeks. I don't know where it came from. Honestly, I'm not even sure what I'm feeling. I'm not feeling forsaken or unloved, and yet, I know that I'm not as happy as I could be. As I should be.

I am a very lucky person. I have good friends. I have a great relationship with my mother. I have a family that absolutly adores me and can't get enough of me while I'm home. But there's something, something stabbing at me in the back of my soul that I can't recognize. Maybe if I knew what it was I could do what's necessary to stop it. 

Maybe it's my self-confidence, or lack thereof, that I have about me doing my job. Some had said, ""You made it through the schoolhouse, you obviously can have what it takes to make it here."" But the thing is, I was shocked that I made it through the schoolhouse. I didn't think I would. Hell, I was <EM>this</EM> close to quitting. Not very many people (meaning no one) knows that. I mean, I actually talked to an instructor about it. Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I just wish I were better at it. It's as if someone turned on a firehose and I'm drowning. For example, someone'll be asking questions and I'll just blank. Then they'll tell me the answer and all I can say is, ""Where's you find that at."" I don't feel like I'm good enough or smart enough.

I've always considered myself intelligent. Not genius or nothing, but fairly smart. High school, when I tried, was easy to me, and yet, not that I'm here, I feel lost and confused. I'm hoping, I'm praying that something will click in me like it did last time and I'll laugh at myself in the future that I ever felt this way. But then we come again about my lack of faith, in which, as I said earlier, I don't know why I'm feeling like that.

If only...I don't know."

Oh, what a Christmas, to have the blues;
My baby's gone;
I have no friends;
To wish me greetings, once again;
Choirs will be singing, Silent Night
Oh, Christmas Carols, by candlelight;

Please come home for Christmas;
Please come home for Christmas;
If not for Christmas, by New Year's Night;

Friends and relations;
Send salutations;
Just as sure as the stars shine above;
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear;
The time of year to be with the one that you love;

Then will you tell me, you'll never more roam;
Christmas and New Year will find you home;
There'll be no more sorrow;
No grief or pain;
'Cause I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again.</CENTER>"

Fucking military won't baby me. They just make me fly again the next day. But I feel like crap. If I feel this bad tomorrow morning I'm going to pull myself off the line and go to the doctor which I really don't want to do because I just started flying and I don't want people to think that I'm wussing out.



I want someone to make me soup and to nurture and care for me. Is that too much to ask? Maybe I should go downtown and buy a whore for a few hours just so she can cook me soup, forget sex. I want SOUP!

I have my first flight tomorrow. I am so nervous. First of all, this is the first time I've flown since Oct 14th, and secondly, this is my first flight at my unit. Hopefully I'll do well. And plus being the baby of the squadron (seriously, I'm the youngest by far) I have a lot to prove. A lot of the instructors there don't like the whole, ""high school to flight school"" thing, which is exactly what I did. As someone pointed out to me though, I've gotten this far, so there's no reason to think I can't go further. Hopefully he's right.

Oh well, tomorrow night I'll be studying everything I get yelled at for. That's the best way I learn; get made to feel like an idiot so I know exactly what I need to know, and then learn it. One thing I've noticed that I have that a lot of my buddies that I got through the schoolhouse with is that out of most of them, I'm the best with books. They have to learn by doing, whereas I can read it and then learn.&nbsp;

So who do you think is gonna win the Superbowl today?  My guess is the Panthers.  I'm not a football fan, but I get into it when Superbowl nears.  I don't think it's so much of a big deal down here as it was last year, because last year the hometown won and this year they didn't do crap.  I don't like the Bucs."

Caleb's leg was amputated today.  I want to see how everything went and make sure he's doing okay, but I don't want to bother his family right now.  Although the concern is killing me inside.  It just breaks my heart to know he's in the hospital again, let alone he has cancer.  But I guess what he told me yesterday was right, you need to have a sense of humor in order to survive.  I'm just taken back by how calm he is.

Today was the last day I'll see Sarah until the end of March.  On the way home I had to pull over into a parking lot and just screamed and cried and let all my emotion out.  I needed it.

Oh, and Dad, you snoop around for skeletons in the closet.  I'm pretty sure you have quite a few skeletons hanging up there too.  My close friends know what I'm talking about."

"event","Caleb has connective tissue cancer.  He called me today and told me that the cancer was just around his right knee, but just in that area alone they've found multiple malignant tumours, most to deep to just cut out.  So in order to prevent the cancer from spreading, his right leg is going to be amputated, and chemotherapy for precaution incase of any dormant cells.  I had to prevent myself from crying because I had to drive.  The reality of this is hitting slowly but hard.  Now I know how people feel when they say, ""You never think cancer will hit close to home.""

Sarah is leaving on Feb. 4th for basic training.  I'm at her house right now, and tomorrow I go home and it will be the last time I see her before her graduation from basic.

Travel Plans for 2004:
End of March - Sarah's graduation for basic training in Missouri
Spring Breakish - Trip w/ LeLe (most likely to NYC)
End of April - Upstate NY for great grandpa's burial 
Summer - Out west (The Rocky Mountains & The Grand Canyon)

...and maybe more.  There's alot of places I'd like to go this year.


Forget to mention yesterday the trip to the dentist.  Wasn't as bad as my old dentist, but I still don't like going.  They smoothed out my chipped tooth, and told me I have Periodontal Disease, and I have a really bad infection in the gum line of my left upper back teeth.  So I have to go in on February 6th (Caleb's b-day) for one of those extreme cleaning surgeries.  *groans*
I'm also getting my wisdom teeth pulled sometime in the near future. *groans*

We've been drowning in rain last night and this morning.  The wind blew the front door open just enough to make the alarm go off and wake my dreamful self up.  That happend around 2, then I didn't go back to sleep and started watching TV, then around 4 lightning hit the house.  I think it just hit the satellite cause the TV went out for a few minutes.  Good thing the power didn't go on.  I literally have panic attacks in total darkness.

It's a mixture of different things, I'm sad that tomorrow and Wednesday will be the last time I see Sarah for a long time, and we will miss each other's milestone b-day.  I'm also developing nervousness about different things that are coming up, and not because I'm unsure.  It's the kind of nervousness you feel when your interviewing for your dream job.  But I blamed it on being unsure, I don't know if anyone read the last post before I edited it.  To all I did confuse though, I'm sorry.  I can't believe I said it out loud.  The reason I'd edited it was because I couldn't stand looking at it.  I'm sorry, I'm very emotional right now, and I'll be back to normal shortly.

Sarah's in the army now.  She leaves for basic training on February 4th.  I'm very happy for her, but I am so sad she's leaving.  I have to keep reminding myself it's too soon to cry.  I promise I'm gonna try to make it to your graduation, Sarah!  Even if I have to lie, cheat, and steal.

What would you all think if I got Gastric Bypass Surgery?  I know, it is an extremely risky surgery.  But I'm in the middle of exploring it as a last resort if I can't loose weight.  And I qualify for the surgery.  This isn't something I'm just gonna go out and do tomorrow though.  I'm going to keep studying up on it, and if I still feel this is something I want to do, I'm going to ask my doctor about it when I see him in May.

I've been under spells of insomnia ever since I got back from Hawaii, although apparently everyone else has adjusted back to regular time.  I haven't really be doing anything or going anywhere, except to go take care of the horses.  I've been sitting around waiting for every girl's favorite aunt to visit.

Sorry everyone, you probably won't get your Christmas presents till January.  I'm broke.  So, if you want something in a decent price range that you don't get for Christmas, let me know."

"event","Ahhh, I'm home!  I'm so happy!!!  Even if it is below 40 degrees outside.  I get enough 80 degree weather during the summer, and after three weeks I kind of got tired of staring at this everyday.

No offense, because I do think Hawaii is pretty, but it's a tad bit overrated and TV and pictures make it look alot nicer.  Things look a bit dirty.  And buildings looked like they were ready to keel over, even our hotel (ahem, condo) looked like it was gonna fall apart.  Oh wait, it did!
<center><img src=""http://pic1.picturetrail.com/VOL123/1333127/2534625/40687774.jpg""></a></center>

Well, not the actual building itself, as you can tell.  Just the carpool.  It was scary when it happend, which was on the 6th.  The piece they collasped fell on top of a car with kids inside, and their mother was screaming.  I thought she had just lost her children right before my eyes.  But suprisingly and thankfully, no one was killed or even injured.

I could go on and on about Hawaii, but I won't.  I've been there now, I don't need to go back anytime soon. Now that I'm home, I think I need to adjust back to my own time zone and go to bed.  Sleep is not something I've seen much of since the 18th.  I've put big meaning to the word insomnia.

NOW THIS, was the ultimate highlight of my trip.

We went in early because of my mom, so Sarah and I went and got up front, and stayed there the whole show (yay! hehe).  Mom and Christina stayed out of the crowd.  Sarah had her phone with her, so we did manage to get some pictures (even though cameras aren't allowed).  They did an encore of Christina Aguilera's ""Dirrty"".  It was quite amusing.

They only not-so-great part, I have so much disrespect for fans of them.  They were revealing clothing, the have so much hatred towards the people up front that they feel the need to kill you to death just so you can touch thier hands,  they scream at inappropriate moments, and they throw stuff on stage.  During ""Penny and Me"", someone thought it would be a good idea to throw pennies on stage.  One not only hit the back of my head, but the ones that made it on stage hit Isaac's <b>Taylor 810</b> guitar and scratched it.

"event","It's started off when my mother and I decided to go out to breakfast at Cracker Barrel.  Afterwards, we went to go walk around the store part and check out the Halloween stuff.  As I was walking towards it, I slipped on something but caught my balance. 
""Have a nice trip?"", asked my mom.
""Err...yeah.  What did I step in?"" I asked.
We looked down and saw something smeared on the floor.  
""I don't know, it looks like some kind of gel.  I'll go get someone to clean it up.  Wait here,"" mom said.
A few moments after she left, a foul smell came into the air.  It was a familiar smell, but nothing I came across everyday.  Then my eyes widened as I realized I just stepped in HUMAN VOMMIT.
Mom came back with someone and got a whiff of the smell and came to the same conclusion as I did.  Then the person she brought back with her noticed another pile of it (unsmeared) about 6 feet away.  Then the manager came over, as someone came out of the men's bathroom and reported that someone had thrown up all over the place.
You know, leave it to a man to throw up and not tell anyone about it.  Gosh, that was so disgusting!  And <b>it was on the bottom of my shoe!!!</b>

After wiping my shoe off in the grass, we headed over to the barn to feed the horses.  When we got to the gate, it was unlocked!  Nothing was stolen, so we figured Dad came and got the fishing poles off of the boat, cause he's competing in a fishing tournament tomorrow.  But then we called my Dad and he said he hadn't been there.  So someone came onto our property, but didn't steal anything after realizing that everything we kept there was locked up nice and tight.  Man, too many low life theieves live in Myakka City.

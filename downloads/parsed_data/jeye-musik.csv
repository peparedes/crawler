"event","post about so many things, i've even intended to.  but motivation has always escaped me.  right now, my whole left hand side hurts.  what started as pain in my heel occasionally over a month ago has in the last 3 or 4 days been upgraded to ""maybe i should see a doctor"".

so anyway, forget about typing anything sensible!  the first bands for the big 10th (that's TENTH anniversary) Infest have been announced.  they're bound to push the boat out and get some one exciting.... or maybe it'll be PIE Nation.  not exactly the square root of EXCITEMENT squared is it....  their website is even proclaiming that 13th Monkey are a rhythmic noise band.  not on my watch.  i've been advised that Caustic are pretty decent but at it stands there's not a lot of excitement to be had thus far.  i'm hoping they have something a bit more substantial in the pipeline.

to cap it off, they've even nicked the Tresor logo on the front page of their site."

"event","just a quick note before hitting the hay, and having mulled it over, i think i would rather that Smith just left.  whilst appreciating what's he had achieved in his tenure so far, if he's so intent on heading backwards then i don't think he is the man for the Scotland job.  any suggestion of a split deal is just going to lead to conflicts of loyalties.  that said, no doubt the machinations of the next few days will twist things further... be curious to see how it all pans out.

ok, apologies for the decidedly non-LJ-friendly subject matter.  back to normal programming, i'm really looking forward to hearing Eye's debut album.  their first demo is awesome so hearing these songs with a better production will be grand."

never to fear though, i've amused myself with shopping for CDs at Boomkat.  nice.  as an aside i notice that they've started doing MP3 releases for a number of labels including Morr and CCO for all your melodic girly electronica needs.  but the thing that's grabbing my interest is that the Modern Love back catalogue of 12""'s are now available.  i fear i'll be investing in a key selection of Andy Stott, Claro Intellecto and Bitstream goodness."

"event","i don't really subscribe to the thought that music has good or bad years until you've had a good few years to mull it over and decide that is the case.  for example, 1997 was a great year.  i couldn't comment on 2005 yet.  2006 was good for me although the usual fluctuation in trend perhaps weren't ideal for me.  this meant, that i spent maybe a little more time investigating older bands than i might have normally done listening to the current releases but from an outsider's perspective it's possibly academic seeing as i have such a voracious appetite for music.  pushing aside thoughts of further waffling to the side, let's get down to business in alphabetical order:

<B>ellen allien & apparat</B> <I>orchestra of bubbles</I>
<B>mogwai</B> <I>mr beast</I>
<B>orphx</B> <I>insurgent flows</I>
<B>substance & vainqueur</B> <I>surface / immersion 12""</I>
<B>white rose movement</B> <I>kick</I>

which covers me for releases this year (orphx might've been 05 but i was late getting on board that one - sue me).  which moves me onto 5 older or classic albums i've finally got around to buying or re-discovered or plain just found-out about:

<B>basic channel</B> <I>various 12""s that plugged the holes in my collection (03, 05 and 07 if you're keeping track)</I>
<B>big black</B> <I>songs about fcking</I>
<B>the cure</B> <I>the head on the door</I>
<B>joy divison</B> <I>heart and soul boxset</I>
<B>meat beat manifesto</B> <I>storm the studio</I>

that summarises the situation nicely.  i had thought about going into more detail, but you'll probably thank me for not stooping to that level.

what about everyone else?  not seen too many end of year lists yet.... don't pretend your inner-geek doesn't love this sht."

not really seeing the appeal in heading out anywhere to celebrate new year, there was some talk of people coming up here but that fell by the way-side and it's just me + the mrs + the cat.  but it's ok, festive Only An Excuse to exercise the laugh glands.

so i'll do the top 25 bands meme thing that has been on other folks journal recently.  this isn't a current listening or a definitive list of greatest of all time.  it's just the 25 that pop into mind as being those that i've been consistently listening to for a period of time.  let's get down to it.

1.  Kraftwerk
2.  Autechre
3.  Mogwai
4.  Skinny Puppy
5.  Sigur Ros
6.  Big Black
7.  White Rose Movement
8.  Ulrich Schnauss
9.  Joy Division
10. Lali Puna
11. Coil
12. The Cure
13. LFO
14. Babyland
15. Forma Tadre
16. Biosphere
17. Drexciya
18. Gridlock
19. Meat Beat Manifesto
20. Beefcake
21. Sage Francis
22. Synapscape
23. Curve
24. Monolake
25. Godflesh

Questions:

What was the first song you ever heard by 6?

   ""Passing Complexion"" is the first I remember, it's quite Christmassy which is why it stuck in my head versus other songs on Richman's

What is your favorite album by 2?

   Tri Repetae++ 

What is your favorite lyric that 1 has sung?

   and at the dawn of night, this city's made of light

How many times have you seen 11 live?

   once at ATP - the ambulance died in his arms is the recording of it

What is your favorite song by 7?

   london's mine

What is a good memory you have involving 20?

   when Moondrops was played at a industrial/goth club and most punters were non-plussed by the gorgeousness of it.  i think they were close to breaking down the door to the dj booth and demanding that the normal shite be played.

Is there a song by 3 that makes you sad?

   r u still in 2 it

What is your favorite lyric that 14 has sung?

   mother and father, don't you know, he's doing the best that he can

What is your favorite song by 19?

   strap down

How did you first get into 22?

   i think it was in 96 just after i'd first heard Ant-Zen stuff on a free cd that came with a magazine called Culture Shock.  uncle Peter bought either Rage or Synapscape because it was on Ant-Zen and it was new and exciting.  as i recall i quite liked them but didn't really start to appreciate them until the Ant-hology box set came out and I heard Travel.  which i still rate as    one of their best songs.

What was the first song you heard by 21?

   crack pipes

What is your favorite song by 4?

   harsh stone white (live) - the version from the Spasmolytic single

How many time have you seen 10 live?

   never

What is a good memory you have involving 13?

   i saw Speedy J when he toured for Loudboxer and the whole night was full of faceless repetitive soul-less techno (as opposed to the life-affirming repetitive techno) and it was just such a welcome relief to hear one of the Djs play the Sweep Mix of Tied Up.  Speedy J was dull as fck    that night as well.

Is there a song by 23 that makes you sad?

   unreadable communication

What is your favorite album of 15?

   navigator

What is your favorite lyric that 9 has sung?

   i'll break them down, no mercy shown, heaven knows, it's got to be this time (and yes, curtis did it best)

What is your favorite song by 8?

   in all the wrong places

What is your favorite song by 16?

   novelty waves (most of their stuff needs to be listened to as an album)

How many times have you seen 5 live?

   once

What is your favorite album by 12?

   head on the door

What is a good memory you have involving 25?

   sitting on the grass at my parent's house during the summer before i went to Uni with the sun beating down, the patio door wide open and Crush My Sould playing really really loud on the stereo.  i'm not sure the punters in Lochmaben were as impressed as i was.

What was the first song you heard by 18?

   i had to check Discogs.com, it was Sickness on a comp. in 98 and i remember being a little dissapointed as they were the latest band who were meant to be the new Puppy.

What is your favorite song by 17?

   probably Digital Tsunami but they always have the F U N K ! ! ! 

What is your favorite album by 24?

   momentum

How many of your top 25 have you seen live?

   15 but i can be forgiven for a few.....

that was fun!"

"event","productivity reigned supreme yesterday and it will do again today just as soon as spew out some words about the White Rose Movement gig on Wednesday.  the quick summary for those that can't be arsed with my ramblings is awesome.

support bands were typical for a touring band in that they were kind of rubbish but worth mocking even if i can't remember their names.  band #1 came from Stornoway we were advised and it would seem there is dearth of indie kids in the Hebrides as the three emo boys that fronted them looked to be fashioning themselves on whatever's hip with NME whereas the drummer was punk as fck modelling himself on Blink 187463934.  shattoos and shohawk in full effect.  musically they were forgettable indie though the singer did a particularly frustrating impression of Brian Molko from Place Bo when he sung.  weird.  band #2 tried to give us some sort of early 80's alternative rock thing with programmed rhythms fronted by bass guy and guitar girl.  a bit rubbish so i just mostly ignored them.  the singer lassie was amusing in so far as she looked like some hideous hybrid of Aunt Sally and a hooker doing the charlestown.  Doop doop indeed!

onto White Rose Movement and if i'm honest they started shakily and with the mix all over the place (too little voice and keyboards, then too much keyboards briefly).  but a song and a half in and they were starting to gel a bit so by the time we hit the 3rd song they were in the groove and they got to prove that my love for them was justified.  the great songs from their album lived up to expectation and some of the songs which i rate as good came over live as great.  what i especially like about them was that they did pretty faithful tight versions of their songs that showed what they do in the studio is not just trickery from their producer but they also expanded on the songs adding in little changes here and there.  in particular the keyboard player can tinkle the ivories with aplomb and the drummer can fairly thump the skins, man!  for the music geeks, the drumming was augmented by fadining in and out dub delay lines (2 separate ones with different time settings) which added little tricky idm-esque rhythms that still kicked with the live elements.

so yeah, totally immense.  and perhaps a bonus was that regardless of your preference they're a  band who're easy on the eye (so long as you ignore the guitarist who looks like a mop topped Dwayne Bansey from Spaced)"

"event","not a weekend of earth shattering truths to share with all and sundry but a weekend none the less.  Friday night, i head straight to the refined Mr and Mrs Lees from work for some dinner and chat prior to going back into Edinburgh for the Fibumtumbleveter night.  it was live post-rock action with a band called SonVer.  never really heard them before but i'm always into a bit of that action so was keen to see them.  as it transpires they were pretty good -> guy with guitar and lots of effects and girl with cello with lots of effects.  they started off with a particularly spaced out attempt at Flower Of Scotland which though nice sounding was maybe a little fromage.  except for a few moments where they could've been a bit more succinct they scored an A+ from me.  i might've been tempted by their cold capitalist merchandising but cash flow demanded otherwise.

i would've stayed on after the band to hear how a dark ambient club could become danceable but by the time the band finished it was getting on a bit and the drive to Dundee loomed before me.  i look forward to reading the playlists though.  good time then, but if there was one grumble i would make was that before the band the music being played at nightclub volumes which made conversation a bit tricky at times.

ok, the rest of the weekend slipped by and now i'm fighting off the melancholy that strikes me inre work.  but i'm well armed to fight off the melancholy - i've just invested in Native Instrument's Electronic Instruments 2 and later we're going to put up the christmas tree!"

this evening's candidates: the confirmed bands from next years Dark City festival in Edinburger.  and hot-diggity they're rough.  comical just isn't the word.  i like to think of myself of being an open-minded chap who can give anything a fair chance but these acts are making it hard for me.  if there was some kind of Nobel Prize For Lack Of Invention And Talent one of these bad boys would win by a country mile.

"event","whoah, just back from Skye where i went on a little holiday with my wife because it was time for me to become a thirtysomething.  aye, the big three zero.  it's not too bad so far.  i'm going to summarise it with little regard for punctuation.

scary drive in the snow; avoided dying; arrived in skye - hotel was cool; weather rubbish all weekend; took some nice photos but mostly of landscapes as it was too cold/wet/windy to venture out of the car for extended periods; decided skye is really beautiful and that we'll need to go back once the weather is more clement; food at hotel was just tasty-t; birthday itself was nice and i got cool cards and prizes from folks; drove back down the road which scary though slightly less so than the way up.

now i'm home and glad to have tomorrow off."

"event","the astute of you will, no doubt, have noted that my gums have been in a non-bumped type of state of late when it comes to music.  and furthermore you might be thinking something has gone horribly astray.  well, not really - i just haven't quite been able to get my typing fingers out of neutral when it comes to waxing lyrical in stupefying detail.  which has nothing to do with the music i've been listening to of late, it's been keeping me amused in an acceptable manner.  however, i have ordered <A HREF=""http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=24686"">this</A> from Boomkat and it's currently winging it's way to me courtesy of our chums in the royal mail.

"event","helping the missus out with some photogrpahicaliacal action intermittently here so i thought why don't i post on LJ for a laugh - outline the excitement factor five that was my weekend. actually, that could be overstating the case.  So, for example, the missus and I got ahead of the game on the XMas shopping front down in Edinburger which is sweet although I seem to have aggravated an old ankle injury.  I assume it's an old one as i really don't recall how i achieved it - going to the doc's in half an hour or so just to get it checked out.

then on sunday, i went down to Law to visit my friend Will.  good to catch-up and as usual i was favourite-old-weird-sort-of-uncle John to his son Frazer.  which is easy to do for a 5 year old boy, you just build him a new layout for his Scaletrix and pick him up by the ankles and swing about upside down.  nae panic.

obviously i did other things, like watch the Adam & Joe DVD my missus got for her birthday which made me laugh, watched some foosball, watched some Northern Exposure on DVD... yeah.  you'd never guess i had a change of decade coming up!"

"event","thanks to the folks that came along to the gig on Friday, it was nice of you to do so.  the gig went well with the new PA that the Tronic guys have sounding pretty sweet.  mostly happy with my set, and weirdly it was one of the first gigs i've played where i've not come away being really down on myself for screwing stuff up.  plus, a fair few people said nice things about it too which was nice.  now i need to get focussed on sending out demo material and finding some party who'd like to release a compact diskette (or something similar).

following on from that, i've just been dodging about the rest of the weekend not really achieving anything notable (does anyone need to know that i got my car serviced yesterday?).  and tonight, with the missus being on nightshift i've been inflicted with a slight dose of post-gig malaise.  lets publicly embarass myself by noting the things i've failed to achieve tonight:

- setting up my studio following the gig
- downloading photos off of the camera
- having a decent dinner (it was crumpets, a muffin and digestives dunked in tea for me)
- doing some housework stuff
- making packed lunch for work tomorrow
- having a shave

that said, i did achieve some things:

- my mum phoned
- i phoned Will
- i watched match of the day
- i read some of my book

ok, so i'll maybe try and quickly rectify some of those failures... looking at the clock i doubt i'll be bouncing out of bed and getting into work for a decent time."

i probably should be annoyed about it, like i'll need to look into getting it serviced but i actually quite like it.  as i can control when it glitches it's almost like my Korg got circuit-bent for nothing."

<I>""My twenty-fifth birthday. The Pukkul Pop Festival was yesterday. ""Pukkul"" means pimple. Feeling pretty old. The Festival was way too weird. Nazi Ebb were playing by the time we arrived. Shitty little homo disco outfit. Their rumps looked so sweet in those jodhpurs. The drummer farthest from us had a comical little boner for most of the set. We played, broke some stuff, got a good response. All that. Nutty Belgians were hurling sod by the end.""</I>"

"event","there's scarcely been reason or motivation to post here... yesterday was the Mogwai gig in Glasgow which i think, on balance, was a bit of let down.  it was the old firm day in Glasgow which meant that the knuckle-draggers were out in full force doing their best paint a thin layer over their religious bigotry.  that got things off on the wrong foot and then the Barrowlands whipped out a claw-hammer to drive the nails into the coffin of the evening.  the sound in the venue wasn't any great shakes and because it's such a big venue a lot of people were there who seemed to be more than disinterested in the band - there were more than a few MySpazz hipsters.  So, whilst the band were pretty good it just couldn't compare to the gig in the Usher Hall this year where the sound was great, the setlist better and the crowd were much more into what the band were about.  amusingly, the support act last night made me think of a poor man's Kid606 circa 2000 spasmodically chopping and mangling sound with no structure, form, rhyme, reason or thought for the tedium that was mounting.  Then, as the set began to wind-up I recognised some definite 606-isms and a jaunt down the front of the venue revealed it was the man himself - he gathered himself together for the last couple of songs but the damage was done.

other than that, not much else been going on.  work has been tedious and outside work hasn't fuelled me with much to compel my fingers into hot-typing action.  although i have been feeding my filthy addiction for music more than a little of late - bought perhaps too many cd's but i'm still deluding myself that as a i spend so much time commuting i listen to all this shit.  i should knock together a post clueing people in, but no doubt the enthusiasm will depart me before long."

<lj-cut text=""my opinion on the bands that played"">

<B>friday night</B>

Schmoof kicked things off in a retro-kitsch-electro-pop kind of way that i didn't particularly care much for.  i was hoping for more as i was hoping they would be at least a bit different from the majority of acts over the weekend.  in reality though, i didn't think their song writing was much crack and they seemed just too keen to be kitsch and tongue-in-cheek which frustrated.  they did amuse when the lassie singing berated the synth-chappie for his anlogue gear going out of tune when she was hardly a shining bastion of pitch efficiency.  ah, the irony.  the next band were Destroid which was the latest money-spinning incarnation of Danger Daniel Myer - i've no idea if it is money-spinning or not but this really did seem to be music catering to the lowest common future-pop/ebm denominator.  it just seemed weird that he wasn't playing as Haujobb this weekend which i could've enjoyed (even if only for the oldies - 99 and before).  i'm sure that Mr Myer crafted something that was good for the genre, i just think the genre is utterly turgid.  finally then, the big headline band for the night Lab4.  and on this outing, it would seem that they're a couple of fashion assasins with a natty line in by-the-rules trance circa 2000.  i listened in from the top of the stairs for a while before beating a hasty retreat.  apparently they had technical problems, and apparently they were miming.  that's got to be embarrassing.

<B>saturday night</B>

i missed O.V.N.I. so no comments there, but arrived in time for S.K.E.T. whom i expected to be another in the conveyor belt of standard-issue Hands rhythmic-noise bands.  fortunately, they proved me wrong and whilst you could bundle them in with that genre it was nicely done and the music showed nice progression and had the good sense to bring in some understated melody later on to keep things interesting.  two thumbs up from me even if the Dubya Bush samples at the start were a little ill-advised.  i then saw some of Reaper who sit somewhere in the current pantheon of ebm i care little for.  it could be categorised as Hellectro or maybe Terror EBM or maybe Future-pop or whatever the correct micro-genre categorisation should be - i'll be none the wiser.  in real terms you'd be hard pressed to note stylistic differences - at least i would and i'm a muso-geek.  aye, bald shouty guy offset by a couple of clowns in monk's outfits and music that was about as fresh as 4 month old yoghurt.  the next band on were Unter Null who had an entirely different sound in that it was a lassie having a go at being a bald-shouty ebm guy.  so, really it was just the same deal.  if i was being charitable i might say that they attempted to have a little more melody than you average purveyor in this scene but the sounds they use and the way it was all put together left me half-comatose so it's a moot point really.  i was amused though when the singer advised the audience that she would kill anyone who downloads pirate copies of her album from the internet.  yeah, i don't think i need to worry about her coming after me with a knife or a bazooka.

at this point, i feel i should talk about 4-4 beats.  they really did rule over this weekend with an iron-fist.  and it was getting soul destroying.  why are so many modern industrial bands so scared to make rhythms more interesting?

anyway, next up were Architect who were fantastic.  absolutely cracking set and if you'd said to me beforehand that they wouldn't even play anything off Galactic Supermarket then i wouldn't have believed it could be so good.  they started off quite ambient with some fine melodic stuff happening (Myer giving the ivories a good tinkeling) before falling off into some fine Raster-Noton ambiences - all clicks and buzzes.  Then the beats came in with a fine mash-up of a Speedy J loop and gradually built up the intensity over a good number of tracks before finishing up on what could be easily lumped into the rhythmic noise camp (but delivered with such grace and aplomb constantly shifting direction and focus).  Over the piece some of the rhythms were disctinctly off-kilter but looking over the audience it was clear that a lot of folk were getting the groove.  as much as i do think it's been long time since Myer's halcyon days he still knows how to program amazing rhythms.  finally then, the headline band were Rotersand who i saw very little of.  they were pretty much falling into the same camp as Reaper and Unter Null so I had little stamina left to endure another bout of that sort of stuff.  i suppose, once again if i'm being charitable, that if people enjoy that sort of thing then i'm sure those bands had them like a pig in the proverbial but it just doesn't do it for me.

<B>sunday night</B>

due to navigational trauma finding our way into Bradford we missed the very start of the Autoclav1.1 which was a little frustrating.  the set itself was really good with the blend of breakbeats and big melodies being an excellent tonic to the tyranny of the 4-4 beat elsewhere in the weekend.  the stuff from the last album was sounding tight as you would expect but the new stuff was sounding even better. on a side note, i think i'm the only person in the northern hemisphere who isn't all that bothered about the S'Express cover, sure it's decent enough but i would much rather have heard more of the new stuff call me a stick in the mud if you will.  i then went for dinner thereby missing out on Frozen Plasma which wasn't a great loss as they were another project of the guy from Reaper who, if reports are correct, were even more derivative of VNV Nation in this incarnation.  the next band were Stromkern who set i walked in at the end of following a nice bit of food.  a lot of people were advising me that it was EBM but with guitars and rapping so i stuck my head around the door.  personally, i didn't really hear much in the few songs i caught from the top of the stairs to back that summary up.  it could've been a curious combination if it hand but again they were another band that set off my now increasingly well adapted ""modern-day-ebm-sensors"" off so i skulked off thinking this isn't my bag.  again.

next were Wai Pi Wai.  i'd heard their first album which i recall as being ok and something i'd sort of filed away and i knew they were on Hands so my expectations were middling but i was keen to give them a go.  which was nice because it transpired that they were totally busting holes out of trojans.  sound-wise they shared a lot in common with current electro such as Dynarec or Bitstream, maybe with a little more oomph given the bands background.  not afraid to mix-up the more elctroid rhythms with straight four-four but always keeping it evolving and therefore fresh sounding. sensibly i nipped up to the Hands stall mid-set to grab a copy of their new e.p. and made it back in time for more aural goodness.  one track in particular, not sure what it was called, just sounding like a slick-up-to-the-minute take on Newbuild-era 808 State and that is seriously high praise.  finally then, the festival was finished off with a performance from Front Line Assembly who i will report were good value and had i still been as much of an FLA fanboy as i was ten years ago would've totally rocked my world.  as it is sick of BLeeb's output for a long time now and so this was more like a pleasant stroll into a nostalgic lane.  the band did put on a good show, the live drums, guitar and synths really making the music feel much more dynamic than a lot of other offerings through-out the weekend.  i caught some classics that had me tapping my toes, so yeah, good stuff.

<b>overall then</B>

i enjoyed more of the bands than i initially expected.  normally i would've expected to enjoy a couple.  but this time it was five, which probably shatter all records for previous Infests for me.  it would even make me seriously consider coming along again next year providing the band line-up has a few options to tempt me.

what did it consist of?  well, the bands were better than expected, the dj's were rubbish, the banter was great, the fashion sense of some of the punters was incomprehensible, the journey down was marred by traffic trauma and the discovery of the awesomeness that is tesco's veggie hotdogs.

right, i'm going to phone my sister before she heads off to Kenya with pupils from her school.  then i might come back and wax lyrical on the bands and the djs because i'm almost sure folk are hanging off my every word."

"event","zero thirty eight hundred hours and i should go to sleep because i have to get up in 15 minutes (at least it feels like it) to go to work.  but i'm not just now because i've had a really good weekend and the thought of the hum-drum of work is just annoying.  anyway, so this weekend, i've done a whole load of nothing significant but it's been really productive.  watched Jason And The Argonauts (sort of) and then Ice Station Zebra tonight.  ISZ is fantastic, i would recommend it.

but the main thrust of my productivity has been musical as my laptop is now (kind of) working.  it's exciting in my world!"

"event","busy day, but it was important to send this one out.  as much as a Kraftwerk fan as i am, i've never ever listened to their pre-Autobahn material; not sure why.  probably it's the bands own distancing from that material, but i just haven't.  however, a few days i stumbled across a link to an MP3 download of a sound-board live recording of a concert from 1971 where it's essentially Ralf and Florian along with Michael and Klaus from Neu! from before Neu! existed.  Needless to say I was in like Flint and downloaded like a maniac.

opinion -> it's totally fantastic.  not at all like Kraftwerk and much more like Neu! especially with the drums and guitar being so upfront.  even so, it's a great recording and it just seems really weird to listen to Kraftwerk, the most austere men to ever grace this planet, rock out in what can only be described as a filthy fashion in places.

so, yeah, check it out - http://www.bigozine2.com/archive/ARrarities06/ARkwbremen.html"

"event","<B>really annoyed and seething</B>.  my whole plan on moving into the new house was to spend some time making sure that all the odd-jobs and such like got down, then i worked on the missus website and sorted out a new design.  and finally, after what feels like ages of having put doing my music on hold and feeling all fresh and bursting with ideas for songs AND having got all my gear setup just nicely so i can integrate all my hardware in with the software everything just goes wrong.  i've been wrestling with the laptop for a couple of weeks now, installing, re-installing, and trying my best to isolate where the problem lies.  eventually i bit the bullet and rebuilt the thing this weekend.  which i did not want to do as it means reinstalling all my software and reauthenticating it all and generally spending even more time that i don't want to be spending dealing with this morass of absolute pish.  but at least at the end of that, my laptop will work and i can just turn some of these ideas i've been noodling about on keyboards with for the last while into actual songs that someone somewhere might actually enjoy listening to.

of course.

those hours are spent and the thing still isn't working.  the audio just glitches horrifically.  more investigation, more seconds tick away and marshall themselves into minutes, hours, squadrons and platoons.  it must be hardware with the laptop, speak to a few computer-based-muso-types on the web and the prognosis is starting to look like the motherboard fan is gubbed.  i'm not even sure how fixable this is given that it's a laptop.

options now would seem to be to either to send the laptop back to manufacturer and get it fixed (could be weeks), buy a new laptop (could be expensive) or buy a new desktop to use as my main music machine and look to get the laptop fixed in the longer term for playing live.  but again, that will cost money.  

BIG question - anyone had to replace a laptop motherboard fan?  is it pretty simple or am i definitely looking at sending this thing off?"

"event","you know stuff going on... but i'll brush past that and wax lyrical about Synapscape by Synapscape.  pulled this one out on a whim and it is, to be blunt, absolutely amazing.  and the thing is, looking at the case, is that this was recorded in 94/95 and to me it sounds so much fresher and interesting than so much of the current crop of rhythmic industrial/power noise (or whatever the genre is called these days).  emotively, it's rich too.  it can be aggressive, or it can get occasionally introspective.  in places they even get the FUNK out.  more bands should embrace the funk.  the production is great too, there is depth and character - it's not just some rhythmically uninventive arse-clown with access to some cracked distortion plugins.  ok, it's not so clean and crisp but that's a plus point i think - too much is sterile today.  maybe the big difference is that this is so clearly the product of a couple of guys hunched over tables of equipment making music and not parked in front of the LCD screen working on their monitor tans.  i definitely feel it myself, when i'm writing music that i spend perhaps a little too much time in front of the computer loosing that tactile aspect and automating things way too much.  i'm definitely going to lay off the computer more for the Jeye stuff i'm working on.

anyway, people who don't have this album should go out and buy the actual CD.  it'll be a search but it would be worth it, much more rewarding than flogging on to some P2P software and downloading some dodgey mp3s.  for me, i think i'll take Rage with me to work tomorrow and play it obnoxiously loud when i'm stuck in the usual traffic jam on the forth road bridge."

"event","well, i'm back from my brief holiday.  i'm not sure that i even mentioned here that i was away, but i was.  a short psuedo-road trip thing with the good lady to celebrate our first anniversary.  up one side of Scotland, along the top and down the other side.  overall, it was really nice.

tonight, was planned to be one of productivity, where i immersed myself properly for a decent session of making some music since getting my gear properly setup in the new house.  but that's been knocked on the head by my laptop being gubbed... suspect it could be hardware which i'm less than chuffed about - it just conked out a few weeks back in the ridiculous heat and it's not been right since.  so i gave up and spent some pleasant time making some strangely early-90s  sounding ambient on a couple of keyboards.  obviously i could've recorded it, but i think i just wanted to make some sound that was lush.  might dust the mini disk recorder off and write a song entirely without a computer at all tomorrow if rebuilding my laptop doesn't succeed.

now, though, i think i might go make myself a hot chocolate and watch a film.  i guess this is all a bit geriatric.  before i go though, the cd that's on is reminding me that i should've included in my recent post about gigs the Coil gig from ATP."

yes.  we're now online in the new house.  so i'll be communicative once.  not much to report, things are going well in the new house.  it's feeling like home now and it's looking great.  still odd jobs needing done but my portfolio of DIY skillZZZZ is improving.  i've even started playing about with electrical outlets.  and my corner of the spare room that i'm calling a studio is far beyond awesome.... i've had a little tinkle with my FS1-r for the first time in a year or so.  brilliant.  it may well be the lushest synth ever made.

ok, the one bit of sad news in the move is that my CD player has died.  well partly.  which is a sad day as i've had it a long time - 13 years to be precise.  i recall saving my pennies from my Saturday job working in the Deli counter at Prestos in Lockerbie to be able to afford it.  and it's weird that it's survived so long given the number of times i moved flat with it, took it out to pre-club nights i've organised.  life rolls on."

"event","..until we get the new house.  everything should happen tomorrow and then it'll be all systems go on getting moved and such like.  so, right now, i should be packing but i'm just really really tired.  work is knocking seven bells out of me right now.  i don't think i posted here about what's happened in the year i've been at my current work.  to start with, my boss's boss's boss left.  so my boss's boss had his workload increase.  then my boss's boss left.  so my boss's workload increased accordingly.  and a few weeks back my boss left.  which means i'm now doing the job of all those bosses.  obviously there's been shuffling about of staff and responsibilities - it's not like i'm doing 4 people's jobs.  but still, what i am doing and what and who i'm responsible for is pretty intense.  still, in terms of the old ""career"" and broadening prospects it's a good thing.

maybe i'll go pack a box or two more then try and charge the batteries for the coming few days.  and to keep myself focussed and motivated i can revel in the thought that i'll finally be able to setup a home studio and not have to make sacrifices over space.  i might even take photographs once we're settled and i can post them here and talk everybody through my synths.  wouldn't that be exciting?"

<A HREF=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/armandoiannuccischarmoffensive.shtml"">The Charm Offensive</A> has started on radio 4 again and i laughed a lot at it last night.  there's meant to be podcasts of it available from their website but i can't locate them.  maybe after the weekend.

elsewhere, i'm packing because we start moving into the new house on Wednesday."

"event","of anything else worthwhile to post about (and i probably should attempt to post more) i just thought that i should register my excitement about finding out that Mogwai will be releasing Team Handed as a single.  with the magick words that it will have some live songs.  i'm really chuffed; i love that song.  let's face some real home truths here, Mr Beast is a fantastic album and that's one of the highlights (along with Glasgow Mega Snake!!!).  i don't think i ever posted here but i saw Mogwai live recently at the Usher Hall and it really did live up to the hype.  a mind-bending set.  possibly the best gig i've ever been to.. only Kraftwerk and Skinny Puppy stand out instantly as being better.  when they played Like Herod.......

...amazing.

i'll say that with caveats... i've seen a lot of fantastic bands in my time. but really this was actually that good.

but anyway, what other shit have i been listening to?  well.  plenty of guitar action -> mogwai, sigur ros, joy division, explosions in the sky, interpol.  but also, i've been spending a lot of time with the so-called ""idm"" of the mid-90's.  you know, the artificial intelligence stuff, ae, beaumont hanant, biosphere.  into the realms of Chain Reaction.  just reacquainting myself.

ahhh, but anyway. i'm not actually typing anything with intrinsic value."

"event","...after the weekend.  the gig on Sunday night was great fun, all the bands did their thing with style and panache.  i was surprised that Gav and i managed to be as smooth as we were seeing as we only had an hour and a half to rehearse before hand.  but it was fun overall.  thanks to all involved, and a sigh of resignation to the punters of Edinburgh for not coming out and seeing some nice music played live."

"event","just a quick post as you'll probably guess from my lack of activity on here and email of late i've been busy busy busy.  so, Jeye live on Sunday in Edinburgh.  it's a Jeye versus LAN formatique situation, we'll play a short set each and then collaborate.  definitely a much atmospheric and placid affair than our usual stuff.  but i think it should be really nice, met with Gav last night for a short rehearsal and it was sounding pretty damned sweet.  fingers crossed for Sunday.

also playing are Wraiths who i've not heard yet, but i figure they'll be laying on the ambience thick and oppressive.  headlining will be the Law [Rah] Collective which will be smart.  i've managed to loose track of their recorded output since their album on PBR quite a while back and i managed to miss their gig at Maschinenfest the last time i was there because i wasn't well.  that said, i'm excited nevertheless as all i read about them live says good things.

ok, i'll try and update this thing more regularly.  in the meantime, all the details about the gig could be located here:

oh, and check the Detritus gig too, i wasn't able to play that one as it's the weekend i'm moving house.  but instead they've got Chikuma playing who is pretty awesome live.  as will LAN_Form especially if he's playing some of that new stuff."

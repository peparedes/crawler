"event","i watched the sex and the city epside twice on sunday and both times completely lost it when the montage of the series played at the end.

i think what's so amazing about this show is the ability for its watchers and fans to relate to it, talk about it, act like the characters aren't just characters, they <i>are</i> members of our family. especially this season, with the immense charcter growth of all the ladies.

we've been through weddings and a divorce, a baby and miscarriage, moving and shopping and shoes, good bad and ugly dates and sex...and for it all to end? it hasn't really hit me yet, but the question has already been posed:

what am i going to do with myself come february 23?!"

i found out on wednesday that i got into habitat for humanity's international spring break trip to mexico. very excited and a bit surprising, as the extent of construction/painting/habitat experience is me watching brynna and julia paint their rooms this summer. but anyways, i'm off to mexico this spring break with a team that i hope to get to know and become friends with. that's kinda what i wrote my essay on. and also, maybe if the trip is to juarez, i will see roberto. 

anyways, yeah that was the bright spot of the week. that and watching elliott goodman represent alpha phi omega today in the polar bear run. seeing my residents however? not so good..."

- ace of base was on the radio this morning and so i felt old. then sonal said that full house is now a ""classic"" show on tv, and she too felt old. then we got dollar lattes and walked around in the snow and felt young again.

- hitchcock is great. iceskating is great. the two together are great.

- i am currently taking 4 classes right now; intro to medical ethics, america in western civ, qualitative studies in the soc sci, and ochem. in that order of liking too. beh. i just hope that the all tu/th schedule doesn't kill me. 

- i have lost my gray sweater, the one i was hoping to wear tomorrow. it makes me feel like i've lost my memory - when did i wear it last? how could i have lost it? why does my backache, why am i tired, why are my posters falling, i have to write thank you cards, i have to organize and (crap!) do laundry, i hope tns goes well tomorrow and stuff in the evening. and oh my goodness, i need to get some money, and figure out this summer and work more at the lab and buy food for next week's study break. these streams of thought, like in amelie, fill my head and sometimes keep me up at night.

alas, i am no longer the birthday girl."

"event","well the travel bug did bite and i've spent the past week visiting friends across the midwest. last weekend was a trip to pittsburgh to see nada and her family and then the past few days was spent in columbus, hopping around the city visiting friends (old and new) and family. i visited my piano teacher, who almost had a heart attack when she saw me at the door since i have not written to her in like two years. i also visited my childhood friend who i lost touch with as we both entered high school. and of course, there was the parties and the doing whatever with gang. all in all both trips were a lot of fun, and it was good for me to get out of the house and be active and see people.

anyways, it's been a long day. 6 hours of driving from ohio to dc and then a 4 hour fiesta bowl game - YAY Buckeyes!

i realized late today that it is the 21st birthday of miss angela g., sweet pea amazing fun chica and one of the many highlights of my highschool life.  i have not talked with her since summer of first year, but angela, i hope you have a good birthday. i am sorry that i do not have your cell phone, home phone, or email address in my databases any more. perhaps i cleaned out that part of my life too soon."

i've also noticed that living in a single for the first time in my college career, i'm messier and louder. probably just filling the position that nada has left. i have to turn up the volume of the classical radio station or the new cd just so i don't have to hear myself think. or hear the silence that surrounds me. also i leave my shoes everywhere, papers in neat little stacks in a circle around the couch. have to keep it messy so it looks lived in and so i have something to do with myself at night.

off to the rat lab so i can say i've had a productive quarter. then packing for home and hanging out with courtney tonight. it will be good to see a friend from ohio."

i also saw kill bill, vol 1 tonight, which mos def the bloodliest, gooriest, most gruesome movies ever. i kinda like it though, even though i had to cuddle up with my jacket and was probably kicking the seat in front of me everytime someone was hit. which was an awful lot, i suppose. it was well told and quentin tarantino certainly has the eye for beautiful scenes.

chock full of midterms and papers, crisis and training, and not being able to see friends like i want to. i feel as if i should know what i want to do with my life and with medicine and psychology. i'm frustrated because i can't take any interesting psychology courses that would help me make this decision about my future because a, they either cancelled the good ones or b, they are all at the same freaking time. stupid ochem, i blame all my problems on you.

and also i miss people. i miss seeing nada even though i hear her voice every day. i miss my parents and both buddys. courtney calls every day and i miss her too. i miss seeing brynna everyday and knowing she lives just next door. i'm surrounded by people here but sometimes you just need the history with someone, the connection, the old stories and jokes and memories.

and sometimes you just need to go home and be with family. t minus a week and half."

up front, stage center, brynna and i were dancing along to everything he had to offer. songs from bewilderbeast, have you fed the fish, about a boy, and even plugging his new album with crazy new songs! the chain-smoking, beanie-wearing, brit took control of the stage and the evening, playing acoustically for most of the concert, but every now and then calling out the drummer, bassist, and keyboardist. he told stories, he rambled, he even passed around a picture of his son oscar (cutie!), and all in all he was amazing. drunk? possibly. wonderfully fun in concert? hellz yeah.

better than last time? perhaps. but maybe because not only was i in the front row, but while he sang the opening song (jackson v baby!) he pointed to me twice. and shook both my hands. and gave me a set list. i think he's in love...*sigh*"

the house is 99.9% done with the constuction. it's totally awesome now and ready for company =)

i treated myself on tuesday to the new barenaked ladies cd - in preparation for the ""peep show"" concert on sat. i think i might cry!

i've been talking with courtney a lot these past couple days. she's a bit lonely, haveing just transferred to osu and is living at home, which is hard since she can't go out with peeps from osu and her parents are always around (scary!). i feel for her, but find myself useless in that i can't really do anything except listen and console. poor dear...i hope that i can see for a bit if she come to chicago early for thanksgiving break. that would be really good for the both of us, i think.

i know i've been mia online lately. i spend just as much time in my room as last year, i suppose, it's just that i don't find myself wanting to be online and chatting  all the time. i just get online now and then to see if my brother or if buddy is online...and they're usually away!

""...I take as my precedent those who have gone before me.  I take as my supplement vitamin C, on which (I have been recently informed) a study was done that concluded no measurable benefits in immunological performance.  However, Mr. Karfunkel, an immunological wonder of sorts, has professed the existence of much evidence that a multi-vitamin taken regularly over a long period of time has the benefits that I would suspect a significant portion of the dorm now seeks.  Viruses or, to use the technical term, ""chemical zombies"" have exchanged ad we now go through what be though of as Intiation or, more purply, 'hazing'.  Many of these viruses are airborne or salivaborne, which then raises the question of why the condom depository at the bottom of section 3 has been so rapidly depleted(1). To quote a wise man referening a simple man paraphrasing a butterfly (dreaming), 'Rats in a cage.'...

"event","OHIO STATE 5-0, 1-0
Cubs win 5-4 and are up one.
Chicago Fire wins 2-0 against Columbus (C'bus) Crew and maintains #1 position in the Eastern Division.
- Chicago Fire soccer game was my (first!) house trip. 13 students, 2 RAs and we were off to the brand new Soldier Field for a night of fun and fireworks. Despite the fact that it took us one hour (AH!) to get to Roosevelt and Michigan, it was a great time had by all. Loads of fun, very successful and lots of bonding. And we all love bonding.

My first study break was on Thursday, thanks to Sonal and Bryn. They basically made everything while I ran back and forth between helping them and doing last minute ochem problem set. On the menu that night was Dirt and Sand - a total success as it was all out by 10:25. Rawk on - major RA points there.

This whole RA thing is getting eaiser. Granted I have no time for anything else - while I try to squeeze in naps, and free reading, and hanging out wth Bryn and Adam and Chong and Robert and everyone else - I find that I spend so much time here hanging out. Watching tv, talking in the Green Room, sitting or throwing a frisbee outside - this place is just buzzing with activity all the time and it's great. 

And it's late again. Tomorrow is the tug-of-war that S-H is prepared to win, complete with a battle flag and cry. There's also APO Clean up Hyde Park, reading for ochem, and a possible trip to Chinatown with Bryn, Jenn and CO.

To end - I am lucky to be where I am today. 

And I am lucky to be going to this show which I a so freaking excited for I don't know what to do with myself:

Barenaked Ladies' ""Everything to Everyone"" is being supported by the aptly named outing Peep Show, which drummer Tyler calls a ""combination promo tour/concert tour."" BNL will be taking questions from the audience, showcasing the majority of the new release and playing a short selection from its back catalog at the end. 


Questions from the audience? Obviously I have to think of what I'm going to ask Eddi rather than prep for my Ochem midterm this week...shiznit!"

"event","so the whole ""i only have classes tues/thurs"" thing didn't work out so well.
first off, as cool as t. luhrman is, psychological anthropology is not all that i thought it would be. i guess i didn't really have much thought one what it would be, but it's more anthropology than i can probably handle. so i am considering darwinian medicine, taught by nada's favorite bill wimsatt. this would mean that robert and i have three classes together - hip hip hooray!

i got a call from proof. they asked me to be an extra on wednesday and thursday. too bad i cannot miss a class of ochem, else i'd be there at 6:30 am rubbing elbows with gwenyth paltrow (yeah right!). but maybe they will let me do it on monday, even if it means missing my early morning yoga class!

this evening was the section three tea party. two years ago, a friend of mine (!) invited me to a hitchcock tea party, which i found very weird at the time. i mean, who has tea parties?! so i went, and it was dark and there were lots of people dressed up and the rooms were cool but it was scary. and here i am, buying bulk tea and milk and (stealing..borrowing?) tea from bartlett. our tea part rocked, with christmas lights on the stairwell, and my purple ikea table displaying the goods. we rawk.

tonight was also the first study break, hosted by the amazing jordan. chips & dip (three kinds!) and lots of people. i felt totally natural there, sitting and talking with first years and upperclassmen alike. gossiping about bennifer, britney, and who wore what when. i laughed a lot - more than i remember doing in a while. it was utterly comfortable and amazing. 

there is a lambda party on friday night but i am on duty. i don't really care that much. i need to get work done because i know that it won't happen otherwise. tonight i planned on crashing early, and look, i went and spent 6 hours hanging out with people. they say here that you really do have to go to the reg to get work done. else, there's always something to do, someone to talk to.

and after i said goodnight to everyone and made my way up the stairs to my room, i realized that i am falling in love with this place and the people here. waiting for me in my inbox was an emai one of my fav residents (not even one of mine, but snell's!) wrote to me to apologize because he did not make it to the tea party like he promised. dorky yes, but it brought a smile to my face.

jordan also just sent me this link:

yeah, this year is going to be fine. 

just wait until tomorrow after house elections. botany pond is freezing cold and i will be one unhappy chica..."

"event","i'm tired although this week has not been physically draining. 

today i went to the lincoln park zoo with about 12 first years and 4 upper classmen. i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to talk with the first years about their experience thus far and perhaps meet and get to know the returnees as well. and as we all know, talking on public transportation is tiring, having to yell over the noise of the train and traffic. and also when you don't know what to say i suppose that cuts on the conversation a little too. 

in the end, our large group split up into ""groups of friends"". i was with a group of first years  that did not come with their roommate...basically those that really weren't attached yet. so we walked around, saw the monkeys and the snakes and the lions and even an armadillo. it was fun and all, but standing there looking at the animals i felt alone. i was the outsider, i didn't fit in. 

the group met up 2 hours later and those that wanted to go thrifting stayed on the north side. me and my posse continued on to the john hancock reception, where i ate some cheese and talked to more first years. it's a lot different getting to know them that i'd expected. i guess i kind of thought that it would be easy to get to know them - that they'd come easily into my open arms and tell me everything about them. well not really, but it's hard. and them not really knowing me makes it harder for them to talk to me. 

it's is the beginning after all. but today, on the bus ride home, i was the only upperclassman on the bus, minus the o-aide on bus duty. as i sat alone, surrounded by the chatter of the first years, i realized that being in the ra position can be as lonely and seperate as i want it to be. i am really isolated from these students, stradling the fence between staff and student. once that a few days ago i did not do so well on and royally screwed up.

so tonight i spent time with friends; catching up, having fun, hanging out. we're all in our own little spaces and can isolate ourselves very easily if we wanted and it just takes a little effort and time to go to someone's place and hang out for awhile. 

and that's what i learned today."

"event","- i spend lots of time at bartlett, eating meals and talking to SnHitcockians. tee hee =)
- i give candy to first years so they stay up late with sugar highs and therefore fail their pe exams.
- i've vacuumed, cleaned, and organized my room, hung up posters and pictures, did laundry, and bought a mini (anna sized!) fridge. it sits in the corner with my purple table from ikea.
- i catch up on all the salacious gossip with jordan, my partner in crime.
- i waited in line for one hour with jordan and janice to sign up to be extras for the filming of ""proof"".
- i talk with first years about placement exams, clases, general chemistry, the math sequences and why i did not like hbc.

i have been through o-week in three different positions and it's still fun!
now, why i'm tired in the middle of the day is beyond me..."

"event","it's midnight and i'm pooped - but what have i done?? i ate brunch for two hours (have to stay at the hitchcock table and greet the students), made a list of busses we can take to get to and from downtown, watched the first episode of alias (totally kick ass! am now hooked) from jordan's very extensive dvd collection, talked online, went to chinatown to eat dinner with 8 first years, and then spent two hours at buddy guy's legands, a blues club for our house activity night. basically i ate and sat around and somehow i'm exhausted.

yesterday went well, considering 48 new students arrived and moved in. it's only been one day but as christopher martin (my new best friend at hitchcock) said this evening, it seems like three. thank god for jordan, cause i had many panic attacks that day. in the morning i didn't know what to say to the first years and their families, i couldn't remember the names and faces that i had gone over so many times before, and i was just so nervous about meeting them and getting to know them. in fact, i still am. i've lost all ability to make small talk - i don't know what to say to these people.

and worst of all. it really hit me yesterday that i am a third year. THIRD YEAR. i am old. i remember when i moved in and met frank and jen and thinking - WOW - two full years under their belts already. it's halfway over guys. and it scares the shit out of me.

i saw nan chen at lunch today and felt old again. i went to high school with him and chong (now a second year and living in hoover), and am so happy that another new albanian is here =) at the same time, he's just starting and i'm almost outta here.

i don't know exactly what i am so scared about. but i can't eat and i can't sleep for very long. i just need to relax, let loose, and enjoy the last week of summer.

today i also learned of a recent death of a student i knew in high school. it was really shocking reading the obituary and having those words sink in. life is beautiful, dear friends, yet short..."

"event","so it's been awhile since i've written in here. partly because i've been so busy with the end of  summer and training, partly because of laziness, and partly because i really don't have anything to write. the past few weeks have gone by quickly and now i am in a position, which two years ago, we all looked up to in some way or another. it's kind of scary, a bit intimidating, and also exciting at the same time. there are 48 first years out there in the city of chicago and in  3 hours they will converge onto the grounds of hitchcock. what a beautiful day it will be.

it's 5:40 am and so begins the life of an ra. 

breakfast is at 7:30 and opening day starts at 8. there are huge signs outside hitchcock: one big white sign across the section 3 stairwell windows that welcome the students to snell hitchcock and have pictures of armadillos, and a large red sign up above the main entrance to hitchcock that has the hitchcock motto on it, which in latin means ""deformed yet useful"".  this morning there will be two armadillos greeting and helping parents manuver the traffic in and out of hitchcock. they are played by scott and maura (who i love!) and the costumes are hilarious! i will obviously take pictures...

this place is crazy but i'm quickly falling in love. at lunch we played flashcards games with the pic book pictures of hitchcock students. of course we were the loudest students in pierce, yelling names, yelling at each other, and laughing...i couldn't imagine being anywhere else.

everyday i wake up and am thankful that i am sleeping in that bed. that i have come this far in my life and am doing things that i'm really excited to be doing now. i just hope that i am a good ra, that the students (esp the returning ones) like me and and enjoy their year here in hitchcock. i hope that i can balance the relationship between friend and staff and also my personal life and ra life. and i also hope that whatever issues and problems that come my way, i will handle effectively and well. 

well it's time to get ready for new students and a new year!! t minus two hours!
hooray for opening day! =)"

"event","i am excited to go home in two weeks, see my family, hang out with the lil brother. buddy is also driving down to see his uncle and he, lil bro, and i will see an rhcp (II!) concert. wahoo, baby! i am so ready for the work, not the summer, to be done. working 40 hours a week, and only getting paid for 20, takes a lot out of you. and perhaps even more when you're on your own.

but the summer has been a good one. i've settled into the McClintock lab and am looking forward to the firstyears and hitchcock hall. tomorrow is my goodbye lunch at the cpo, and it will be hard to say goodbye to the cpo team. spending my time and working in the great lively supportive environment really made uc home.

i went to ohio over the weekend with brynna and janice. we left after work on friday and got to courtney's house at one, after getting really lost somewhere in bumble indianapolis. instead of cutting across indiana diagonally, we ended up driving straight across the top to south bend and then following some hick town road south, all the way down indiana to the capitol. i hate mapquest.com.

saturday was cedar point which still knocks my socks off. courtney drove up and now we all know the justin timberlake cd by heart. well, except for buddy because he was smart and brought headphones and his own cds. that buddy is a smart one.

saturday night there was a party at lyndsay's. i was really excited for this - thinking it would be just like old time, lots of people from school, music, food, and fun. there were a lot of people that i didn't know and for some reason that just made me a little bit nervous. i guess i just don't feel comfortable drinking around a bunch of strangers, but it was also different than the other times. the people at this party, sure i had known them in high school, but there that night they were different. except for buddy and tonio, i didn't recognize ash and lynz and erin. either i'm too old to party and play flip cup or i'm not cut out for that. i think bryn, janice, and i were all equally scared that saturday night.

it saddens me though that the ony way i can connect to some of these people is through parties and drinking. it's probably an effect of my going to a school that doesn't have that sort of culture but at the same time i wouldn't really be into that if i'd gone to osu. i've already lost so much contact with many of my friends from high school. but home is where the heart is and the ones that matter are the ones that i talk to."

"event","it's been awhile lj.

sitting here on colleen's bed that's mine for the summer. or at least for the next month and a half. her fan is also on and blowing towards me, the humid chicago air is nothing like the cold air of the winters. chicago is amazing in the summer - totally different perspective than that of the winter. there's sun and laughter in the air. there's music and food and movies. most weekends have been girls' night out. how wonderful this all is, making plans and being with each other.

stoph and i are yelling back and forth to each other. i'm afraid we're keeping julia up. stoph and i have infiltrated a class of 2007 chatroom. i feel like an imposter, an elder rising second year, but i cannot help but laugh as the incoming first years banter about fonts, ratings, and sexuality. i want to talk to them and tell them that these are the days that we can never get back - these care free summer days. there's so many things that i want to scream out - at them, at the world - but hold inside. about high school and standardized test scotes. about being pre-med. about college and friendships and max palevsky.

but instead i remain on the outside, watching their posts flow up the screen. they are forming quick friendships and i wonder about the validity of it all. some of us learned the hard way, but i hope that someone is there for them when they do realize it."

"event","So it's drizzly and rainy here. There's construction going on all over the house, the front area is all muddy and there's a front entry way being added onto that we have to jump through to enter the front door. It's alot of fun. There's an entire section being added to the back - both stories. So everyday I get woken up around 9:30 by pounding on the roof and hammering and saws whirring. It's interesting because all the construction workers are vietnamese and so I can hear and understand most of what they say. There's something comforting hearing and being around it - I guess just another thing that makes it home is hearing the language. I guess I missed that in Chicago and didn't realized it until now.

I've been thinking more and more about going to Vietnam. It's almost become an obsession to me - all I can think about doing over the next summers. Just visiting the country, learning the language, the culture and traditions, and the history. I just want to see where my parents are from. Where my grandmother and grandfather lived before the war. The stores, the clothes, the food - I hear so much about the Vietnamese food in Vietnam. That's it's the best there and so all you can do is just eat and eat and bask in the savory goodness and the heat of the sun."

Ne wayz, since i'm bored I'm going to update the world of my weekend and the current affairs of my life. This weekend i attended god knows how many parties. 

Friday: umm.. I'm so out of it that i don't even remeber what happend on this day. Hmm... I should probably ask Sam cause in one way or another she was probably involved.... O i remeber now, after that lame senior breakfast, me sam micah holly andrea and amy all went to dairy queen. amy h brandon and krystina were supposed to come over and go swimming at my house but that fell through cause everyone had to work. I think there were parties after that.... 

Sat: GRADUATION!!!! I remeber that IHOP was the center of the universe afterwards because a commment was made about my order off the kid's menu, right after graduating from highschool...lol. After that TEAM AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!! nothing more to add...(*wink *wink)

Sun:I was so exhausted by this day, so exhausted that i ended up sleeping through two of of the parties i was supposed to be at before Micah called me and informed me that i was late for Sam's party. lol. oops... ( I'm really sorry to Lauren and Amy H!!!-CONGRATS!!!!) 
I stopped by Sam's party and then Sava and I headed to Jessica's party at O'Charley's. It was really nice her parents paid for us to have ne thing we wanted off of the menu. After that Sava and I went back to Sam's house to go swimming with micah, amy, sam and alex.(Sry for missing ur party Kim-I love u!!!)When we got to Sam's pool it was full so we took a random late night trip to Lake Alatoona... Lets just say there was some skinny dipping involved....

Mon: Stopped by the school to give some presents to my teachers and then with to dinner with sam

Today: Went shopping and chilled at home some more and caught up with some friends. Tonite was a trip because when attempting to avoid Daniel, Davita and I almost ran into him at Wal-Mart.... lets just say more drama ensued after that cause he saw us...

Now: Talkin on the phone with sam and updating

Tomorrow: I'm supposed to go bowling with John and Ed, who knows if that'll actually happen... I'm not a big bowler...lol"

"event","the fact that i've graduated still hasn't hit me. Oh well, I still have three months until i have to move into agnes scott. I'm finalizing my plans now and i already have my room mate. 

I haven't teared up, cried, or even felt bad about the fact that i won't be attending the hell hole kell next year. I must say that i am sad that all my favorite teachers are missing, now i have no incentive to go to any of my brother's events next year. Now i'll be forced to go and just see him. 

I am afraid that i will lose touch with those that mean the most to me. I'm already getting farther apart from my best friend since first grade (a lot of it has to do with dee tension) and I feel distant from my best guy friend. I guess i just have to have faith that the people that i love most will still be there with me later in life. o well, i guess i better get my ass in gear for next year. I already have to start throwing out some of my shit cause it won't all fit in my dorm room next year. Things would be easier if we had a house..."

It was just like one of those scences in a movie where all the girls gossip and spread stuff around (it was a ton of fun!). Afterwards Amy H, Jessica C, Rachel, and I went to the mall to look for last minute jewlry. That was even more fun because when Jessica and I pulled up to the mall we got to see a car on fire. lol. All of these events lead to today, which is prom. I'm going with John Richards who is really sweet and talked me into going. Although i'm stuck in a limo with a complete bitch pray that i wont punch her head through the limo and that i'll make the best of the entire journey... Ne wayz, I hope everything goes well with everyone else cause i'm trying to avoid ne more drama tonite...."

It was great to have to spend 3-4 hours waiting in line to donate your blood because teachers keep cutting in front of you and the whole thing is ill organized... (at least i got out of class). After school I went with Micheal to visit Sam at work. She was working with the ass-hole who thought we were cool enough for him to refer to me as ""Mark."" That's not the worst part, While I was waiting for Micheal to tip Sam and for us to get the hell out of the rain, this HUMONGOUS downpour falls and instantly we're both soaking wet. As a result, Micheal has to drive me to my car which is only 20ft away so that i don't catch pneumonia and then i must proceed on to Publix (soaking wet)in order to buy groceries for my mother...

She helped me to come up with choices for a solution to the never ending problem/drama i'm having with one friend: 

1)call her out aka fight back

2)take a break from being friends with her

3)don't be friends with her

I decided to choose a combination between 2 and 3. I tried to solve my problem by talking but wasn't taken seriously, and I refuse to sink down to a petty level and call her out (everyone can already see wat she's doing, and they're not talking nicely). As a result i've decided to not confide in her any more. I see it this way: If you're trying to pull me down, i've got to cut you loose."

Unfortunately for Wesleyan, I will not be attending because THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE!!!

Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday) 
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony 
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit 
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, Come on

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation 
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations 
Elevations, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, Come on"

"event","I went to agnes scott this weekend for their achievement weekend and I had a lot of fun! I do feel very reserved about the segregation that takes place in the dorms... Ne wayz, i did find a lot of cool people to hang out with and find out about campus life from. I really want to go to this school but my parents are all bent out of shape because of how much money it takes... As a result i'm being forced to go to Randolph Macon in VA for the same type of weekend just because they are giving me more money. Needless to say, I DON'T WANNA GO! But i digress, I LOVE AGNES SCOTT! and i already told my parents that's where i'm going. I still don't know the final amount of money i'm getting from the school so I really don't know how much i'll be paying in the end. Hopefully they give me more money for violin!"

Wat really happended was, I was sitting at a red light waiting for it to turn green and as soon as it did i went. Well, according to this cop i went while the light was red... I'ts an argument that i will now have to fight in court in april! that's not even the worst part, I didn't have my license on me! But the PIG supposedly gave me a break and only wrote me a ticket for supposedly running the red light.... Grr... Ne wayz, Justin was driving me home from theresa's house and guess wat.. WE GOT PULLED OVER! All the cop did was get out of his car and tell justin to yield better next time and then he left. THAT WAS IT! HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR HIS LICENSE!!!! so...i'm really jealous that i got the asshole cop on chastain while justin got the nice cop on canton... GRRRR....................!"

As a pitiful result we spent two hours in the car, stopping at multiple gas stations, in order to find the friggin' mountain!

But Nathan was acting like an ass so his parents let us take Chubbs and Taylor for ice cream while Nathan wasn't look and we ditched him! lol. We also had to go pick up Patrick and his friend Nathan (2 Nathans how confusing). The highlight of the night is when Sam, Taylor and I dropped Patrick and the 2nd Nathan off at home and they mooned us!

Sat: I went ice skating with Theresa, Dee, Micheal Lee, Molly, Justin, Chris and TJ (everyone feel on their asses and it was hilarious). Afterwards we all went to the movies and saw one of the corniest movies ever, HITCH.( The only thing that made that movie good was the fact that Will Smith was in it lol) I also found out that i got into Randolph Macon and i got a scholarship!

Sun: I went bowling with John, Micheal Lee, Ed, and Justin. I didn't bowl because i suck but i had fun watching Micheal Lee kick everyone's asses.
I swear the kid is a genious at everything. Ne wayz, We all went to Buffalo's afterwards in which john spilled a water on me twice and an ice fight ensued. 

All in all it was a good weekend until i got into a fight with my mother about how i'm never home and she wouldn't let me go out with sam and nathan to dinner. GRRR!"

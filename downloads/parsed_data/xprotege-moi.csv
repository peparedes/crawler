"event","blahh. my birthday sucked then started to rock.
everyone at school forgot. except heather and sammy.
everyone else forgot. =(

my parents left to go to a friends house. they left me!
it sucked so hard.

then, my aunts came over and gave me 75 bucks total. rocks. since i had 175.
so i want an ipod. i'm willing to give my 175 so my parents would only spend 125.

then, paige came over and i started crying because my birthday sucked so badly.
ian called, i love him <3

alright. then, my parents came home. my dad gave me 100 dollars.

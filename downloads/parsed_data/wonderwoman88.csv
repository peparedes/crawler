This semester has started out hectic. I had a little trouble getting back on the ball. 

Except for VOICE!! My lessons have been going really well. I have been practicing too. ha. But I sang for my studio yesterday and I got such a change and was able to open up. ah...amazing feeling

AND I saw probably one of my favorite sopranos on Sunday (besides Natalie Dessay) the lovely Miss Caitlin Andrews!!

February is going to be a busy and great month."

Caitlin's house was sooo fun last night! Clay was definatly surprised, I think, it was kinda hard to read his reaction though. But it was funny!

The we had a ""water balloon fight"" but all the balloons were gone in 10 seconds and like 3 people were wet. Soo we got out the hose and tried to spray Clay, soo how did that turn into me getting soaked?? (Caitlin tell your sister thanks again for the clothes!) Then we danced inside for a little bit, until Caitlin knocked over like 1,000 CDs that was fun. Also, getting beat up by Leah. yay.

Thank you everyone that came! I didn't really get to see everyone but I saw most of you guys! Only a few more days left of school!!! yay!!"

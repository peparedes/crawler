On Monday when I came home from school, i went to pick Josh up and he came over and we watched ""shrek 2.""  omg, it was so funny.  seriously, it was one of the best movies ive ever seen.  We were laughing out butts off.  I think my favorite charector is Puss-n-boots.  he was so incredibly funny.  I love it when he was licking himself and feonia came over and shes like shrek? and then hes like i can be anythig you want me to be baby.  lol. it was so funny.  we had such a good time.  we were just sitting on the couch watching it was we couldnt stop laughing.  It was amazing.  we got along so good and i forogt about everything that was bad that was going on in my life.  We had a great time.

After we dropped him off i had like a huge smile plastered on my face.  I was in such a good mood.  So then at like 8 the door opened, and Jessie and Joel came over.  We were all sitting on the kitchen table and were like 'lets go to excards' so we went to bretts to pick up the camera and he came wiht us and we all made a family trip to excards.  lol.  it was so random.  we were home in like 20 mins, but it was funny.  like i said, it was like a familiy trip. Its nice to be able to just hang out for no reason and have such a good time.  You dont have to be seriosu all the time.  Its greeat to know that people care enough about you that even when we only have 20 mins they stll want to see you.  


So the next day i went over to joshs house.  it was so  fun.  I met his birdie and his cats, and his hamster and his doggie and his farret. We, yet a gain, had such a good time. we talked for awhile about this and that.  Its so cool that theres never an aqward sielce.  We watched the mighty pythona dn the hold grail.  it was so funny, omg.  it was so random, it screamed josh.  the entire time we were laughing and we were just enjoying eachother.  His sis megan showed me her raindeer dance, and her dance to hillary Duff and her drawings.  shes so cute!  she reminds me of what i was when i was little.  lol. Anways, we had such a good time.  i wish i couldve stayed longer but my moms a loser.  lol.  jk.  but really, it was so fun tho, seriuosly.  it was one of the best times ive had in a really long time.  Like i said, i feel so comfortable around him.  We just click.  I dont have to worry about things i do/say around him, cause josh always does something more stupid.  (lol.....just kidding josh!) Seriosuly though, that was one of the best days ive had in forever.

So afer joel came over and I was kinda scared.  he seemed distnt or something.  he told me that he had to tell me soemthing and i was like oh man.  But we started talking, and i got to know him better.  Odviusly, im not going to type what we talked about casue its kinda our buisness, but ik, it just went really really well. We noramlly dont talk about thigns, but we did that day.  It felt good to know that he can trus me enough to tell me stuff.  And i told him stuff that my bestfriend dont really know anout.  We sat in his car for a little bit and then he came in and wanted to hug my mom my goodnite and rach and then we went back outside. So yea, a lot of things we said that we both have been wanting to say, so it went good. It felt good to say somethings. Its like were at peace with things now.  I dont kboq....everything just feels right. I wanted him to know that i know what hes going through to a certain degree. It went really good that we talked.  We needed to.

By the end of that night i was in scuh agood mood, nothing could bring me down. I wsa smiling all night.  Weverything inmy entire day went so well... life is getting better, i can tell.  Things are geting clearer and im understadning a lot.  Ive let go of the past.  I really did.  I went thorugh a couple days whe ididtn know what to do with myself.  Where i wouldve done anything to go back to what was. 

But i think that was just the ending of the chapter.  I needed to greive one last time and imagine how it couldve been.  But now, thats over.  were over. Ive got people in my life who love me, who want to spend 20 mins with me, and thats worth it to them to spend that time with me.  Ive found a reason.  Infact, ive had that reason for quite sometime now, its just now i see it and i feel it.  Im begining again and it feels great. And so, i offically closed a chapter in my life and a new one begins....

                                    ""With every ending coems a new begining...."""

BRIAN McKNIGHT LYRICS

""6,8,12""

Ooh, ooh
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever cry yourself to sleep?
In the middle of the night when you're awake,
Are you calling out for me?
Do you ever reminisce?
I can't believe I'm acting like this
I know it's crazy
How I still can feel your kiss

[1] - It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours
Since you went away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better but it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours
Since you went away

Do you ever ask about me?
Do your friends still tell you what to do?
Every time the phone rings,
Do you wish it was me calling you?
Do you still feel the same?
Or has time put out the flame?
I miss you
Is everything okay?

[Repeat 1]

It's hard enough just passing the time
When I can't seem to get you off my mind
And where is the good in goodbye?
Tell me why, tell me why

[Repeat 1]

Sing it for me
Ooh, ooh

~ALWAYS"

"event","This is so typical.  Im always in trouble.
Okay, well let me start from the begining.

So this morning I had to go to yearbook at 830 cause we have like nothing done.  So i stumbled out of bed at like 8 and got to school at 830.  Dan and amanda met me there and we went up to the room to get everything going.  So we were all there and we were actully having a really good time.  We were goofing around but we got SO much done.  I did like 6 pages and thats A LOT to do in that short of a time.  So anyways, Dave ended up comming in to so we all had a blast.  The yearbook it going to kick ass this year-seriously- its awsome. I love every page so far.  Its totally new than any other year.  Theres like a million pictures and the layouts are so cool.  And get this... we have a theme AND were using school colors!  So the yearbook is going to be awsome.

anyways, i talked to joel at like 11 and she said he was going to pick me up at noon to go out.  So at noon he picked me out and we went out to eat! :-D we had a great time.  It was literally the first time we went out by ourselves.  

And know whats creepy?  We went to Hillview and one of the things we had was onion rings.  So were sitting there, and i was thinking and when we came home I asked my mom and confirmed it. The first time my mom and dad went out alone (not on a date-just alone-like me and joel) was at Hillview and they ordered onion rings!  How incredibly creepy is that!?   I dont know, that was just really weird to me.

So anyways, me and joel had a really good time.  We goofed around, but were serious when we had to be.  It was a great time.  we talked about a lot of things and there was never an aqward silence. We were laughing and smiling...it was a blas.  After lunch, we got it the car and i was like ""hey, lets go see my grandpa.""

So we went to my grandpas house and we had to much fun.  I have to admit, i was a tad nervous.  I didnt know what my grandma and grandpa would do.  I just wanted to go see em and for my grandpa to actully meet one of my friends.  So I did.

I couldnt belive how good they both got along with joel.  It was amazing.  I love my grandma to death, but shes a bossy lady.  She was so nice to joel.  She talked to joel about everything and was so nice.  My grandpa was so nice too.  He talked to Joel and he stayed awake the whole time with us.  He normally doest.  I was there for like 2 hours.  It was a lot of fun.  It was prettuy cool being able to take my someone over to my grandparents.  I  felt grown up.  You know?

So i came home.  and this is when everything went bad.  When we were driving back, Brett called my phone and he seemed really pissed off.  Hes like i was waiting for you to call.  I told him that i was with joel and he knew it.  I guess he left a voicemail on my phone at like 1140 but i didnt call him back.  Well my phone is dumb so i cant check voicemails.  I guess he called my house like 20 times or whatever so he was pissed cause he waited around all day. Brett hasnt bothered with me in 2 months when jessie wasnt around, but all of a sudden he cared.  So that pissed me off.  I was out with Joel, so know he wanted to bother with me.  Idk, that really really hurt me.  Its like no one else is around so sarahs my last option.  And then he makes ME wrong.  Like i said, he hasnt bothered with me for 2 months and he makes me feel like shit because i was out with joel.  Whatever.

So I came in the house and Joel left.  Yea, well, thats when I was yelled at.  My moms mad at me casue i broght joel over to my grandpas house.  I guess youre only supposed to do that when youre really really really serious about someone.  What the fuck?  Joels my friend and i wanted my grandpa to meet him.  I care about Joel.  I didnt know that it was horrible that i did that. I guess my moms afraid my grandpas mad cause hes 20.  I mean, i can see wheres shes comming from, but how the hell was i supposed to know that?  How was i to know that bringing joel over was some huge symbolism?

So if getting yelled at wasnt enough i went online and Josh is mad at me casue i didnt call him.  Oh man.  I was busy this morning and i just forgot to be honest.  I told him last nite that i was prolly going to busy and id call him.  But i forgot to.  I just forgot.  And then joel txtm him from my phone and said ""I love you too josh.  Love Joel.""  Joel didnt mean anything bad by that.  He was just kidding.  Thats what he always does.  So yea, now hes mad at me cause i didt call him.  I keep fuckin messing up.  Everytime.  Everything.  I go out for one day and i mess everything up.  

Im sorry to EVERYONE that i didnt call and tell them exactly where i was.  Im sorry i was having a good time.

So yea ever sience i got home my day has sucked.  My moms talkin to me a little bit now. I can see why shes mad though, i just wish she wouldve siad something to me beofre about its 'significants.'  But oh well, I care about Joel and i wanted them to meet him.

But anyways, I dont regret having him meet my grandparents.  Im really glad I did.  I mean, what if theres no tomorrow?  

If you read this Joel, thanks so much for today.  I had a really good time.  Thanks for being so awsome with my grandparents.  They really liked you, i could tell.  (my grandma must really care if she kept offering you cake!!! lol)  As for my mom, she was mad about something eles with my aunt so she was already pissed off.  But seriously, i had an AMAZING TIME!  I love how everything just works its self out when were together. I had a blast and dot worry about my mom- you know by the morning shell be ok.  She always is.  And as for my grandparents im so glad they met you.  I really ment a lot to me..."

"event","Yet again the morning was sad. Really sad too.  I was crying on the phone with jessie. Joel's aunt passed away.  When Jessie called me to tell me what she was doing she told me about his aunt.  I felt so bad.  It broke my heart that he lost someone else.  Its so not fair.  How could so many bad things happen to one person?  Its times like this when its hard to belive in God.  I mean, why would He do something like that to someone?  When his world finally starts looking up, something bad happens.  Thats not fair.  Its just plainly isnt.  I kno that suffering is a part of life, but my god.  Its so cruel of God to do that to him, and anyone else whose suffered a lot of pain.  Im so upset right now.  i dont even know what to say.  Why does God do this to him?  His mom, dad, aunt and now his uncle.  My heartt hurts for him.  Its just not fair.  

Im so sorry about your uncle Joel, just know that ill be here for you no matter what and you can alwasy count on me.

Well Jessie and Joel went shopping today at the galleria for my bday present :-D  hehe.  Jessie was so excited.  They stopped by before they left.  They were hyper.  LOL.  it was so cute.  it made me laugh.  We were all sitting on the kitchen table and i was like ""do you two want to go now?""  and jessies like ""YES!""  lol.  it was funny.  After they came back joel came over after and gave me a little mermaid cup that him and jessie picked out.  so thanks jessie and joel!!!  (the little mermaid is my fav charector of all time!)  It made me smile.  So yea, they had a great time by what i heard.  Im glad you two had an amazing time! :-D

So they went to the mall and i hung around the house for a little while and then i went to the mall with josh.  we had a great time.  His brothers and sisters we re in the car so i was alittle nervous cause i was like ""what if they dont like me?""  lol.  They were cute.  They made me smile a bunch.  Autum is so random just like josh.  She called me a dirty shoe.  lol.  it was funny.  Then when we were at the mall we walked around for alittle while and then we decided to sit down and we sat infront of Clairs for like an hour and a half just talking.  It was nice.  We talked about a lot of things and i felt totally comfortable.  When we looked up at the clock it was 4 and we only had an hour left....it was crazy.  Time flew by.  So we went and looked for shorts for my sister and then we went and got a drink and just hung out.  I acutllly had a really great time.  We get along so well, its creepy.  We have so much in common too-both the good and the bad.  So yea, thanks for so much fun at the mall Josh!!!!  I had a great time and it took my mind off of things.  Thank you so much Josh.  Youre such an amazing guy. Dont worry, itll all work out...

Well, ive got to eat dinner.  So sorry to Joel about his uncle.  Im so sorry.  I wish that i could erase your pain and make it go away.  Im so sorry sweetie. If you need anything at all, just ask and Ill be there ina heartbeat"

"event","The morning was so sad.  I went to Cassie's dad's memorial mass.  It totally broke my heart.  I wish i couldve made it better for her, but i think showing up showed how much i really value our friendship.  I was really touched how we sat with her too.  That ment a lot to me that she concidered me that close of a friend.  It was so sad and i give her all the strength in the world for standing up and talking and being there.  She did a wonderful job.

After words, me, joel her and amber went to the mall and had an amazing time. They all made me laugh my ass off.  We were all having orgasims on the bed and on the chair.  LOL.  The bed was AMAZING.  When i grow up and become sucessful im gonna buy me one of those.  By the sounds we were making, we so could have sold like 900 of those beds. LOL.(they were those ones where they mold to your body.) We all laughted the enitre time.  I think we were in that store for like 45 mins.  We walked the mall a couple times going here and there.  We just had a good time.

Other than the fact that amber and cassie were all over joel we had a good time (lol.) im just kidding ladies.  It was really funny.  All the poeple were looking at joel like he was a pimp.  Joel was so cute.  He made everyone feel so comfortable around eachtoher.  We all got along so well and the time flew by.  Oh yea the cologne.  Oh man, we were like all over joel there too.  lol.  He smelled amazing.  hehe... he wanted to steal the sample bottle but the lady wouldnt let him.  lol.  that was really funny. The mall was so much fun.  I forgot about all the prooublems in my life and jsut had an amazing time. 


After we dropped them of at home, me and joel talked a lot and i understand him better.  I kno things are hard for both of us.  Life isnt supposed to be a peice of cake.  I just wish that some people would just stay out and let us worry about us and no one else but it.  But oh well. I knew from the day that I met him that it would be hard. But its worth it, he's worth it.  I guess some people are worth the fight-weither it be for frienship or more....hes one of em. (hence my profile)  Theres only a couple of those peoople in my life that i would keep on fighting for and hes definitly one of em.  I hope he knows that.

Everytime Im with Joel we always have a great time. Sure he can at times be a tad immature, but thats ok.  He always makes me smile.  And he never leaves anyone out.  No matter what.  Thats one thing thats awsome.  Any other guy would just keep to himself, but he doesnt. He'll take anyone into the group and get them talking and laughing.  Oh yea-he hugs everyone too. He always talks to my mom and my dad and my sister and never ceases to put a smile on everyone elses face,.  (lol-the first itme my mom met him he reached through the car window and hugged her and afterwords shes like 'i thought he was goin to slice my throat and kidnap you girls.' lol)  I love the fact that he comes in everytime to talk to my mom and sister and dad just to say hi and see how things are going with them.  Whenever he comes in the door my sisters like ""JOEL!""  And she calls him buddy too.  Ok-if rach calls one of my guy friends buddy that means hes ok by her.  lol Anways, he hes so nice.  I knew that from the begining just by the way he talked about ones he cared for.  Even when someone hurts him, he still talks about them nice. Hes been hurt so bad before but he keeps it positive. He doesnt give people excuses, just reasons for what they do. (yes, there is a difference.) Life had been rough for quite some time for me, but he sticking through it with me.  He knows where i stand now, and hes okay with that.  And thats amazing to me.  Odviuolsy i cant tell him everything thats going on cause i just dont know him enough yet.  Just like he keeps somethings private in his life, but thats ok.  Im so glad that i met him.  Its pretty cool when you can find someone and look and them and be like ""theres a reason we met...and i can tell its a good one."" 

I thought it was relly sweet that he came today for cassie.  I mean, he barley knows her, but he went there for her. No one else.  Just her.  I cant get over it.  He has such a big heart and i never ever want to hurt him.  He sat there right beside her and made her smile and when she was crying and afterwords took her out and made her laugh her ass off.  Not many guys would do that for someone.  Hes got a heart of gold.  Thats a fact.

Joel youre such a sweetheart and dont ever chnage for anyone.  If you just belive in youreself, everything will fall into place.  Some things in your past may haunt you, but theres no need to worry.  Youve got people who love and care for you more than you know and theyll always be there for you.  Sometimes you've just got to take the leap of faith.  I love you Joel! (as a friend of course for all you who are reading this!) GOOD NIGHT! :-D"

"event","i was rereading my livejournal and i totally didnt talk enough about josh.  I was like ""geeze, i wasnt very nice...pffftt.""  I mustve gotten really tired adn stopped typing randomly.  lol 
So anyways, We had this amazingly great convorsation.  He made me feel so great.  We were talking about having kids...lol.  And no, not the process of making them, we were talking about how theyd turn out for sum random reason. We know for sure they wouild have like no patience what-so-ever.  So theyre basically screwed in that department.  hehe.  But theyd have tehe best paretns ever!!!  Josh is gonna teach our little girl how to beat up boys that harass her and then shes gonna call her big strong daddy to make em a speed bump. (just like my daddys gonna make him one....lol.)  Josh said that i would be an amazing mom and the said that he wishes his kids would be just like me...aww!  that was so sweet!!! *blushes*  Now i can hpnestly say that no one has ever tole me that, so thats def a frist.  He also said so many things to me that made me smile a HUGE smile.  That was like the best convorsation ever.  hehe.  And THEN i called him at 830 and we talked for like 45 mins.  hes like a part of my routine now.  I call him when i get up in the morning, home from school and then before i go to bed. (wow-rereading that it sounds like i stalk him. l lol) The other day my mom even said ""why is it that youre only happy when youre talking to josh?""  lol she made me laugh.  Shes so funny and so random.  I was like come on, Josh is like an AMAZING friend and he can just cheer me up even when hes down.  i was totally down in the dump befre i talked to him, i mean it.   I had to fake being happy all day to please my friends and when i came home all i wanted to do was lay in myo room and cry my eyes out and scream into my pillow, but when i talked to him, he calmed me down.  I dont think he reliazes how important he is to.  I can trust him with anything, and i mean that.  He even lets me call him at 615 in the morning to wake him up on mon., wed., and fri., and on tues. and thurs. he still lets me call him so that way i can talk to him in the morning before sochool even tho he doesnt have to get up till like 11.  No ones ever wanted to put up with me in the morning before.  He sets my day off to a good start, and i dont kno what the hell i would do without him.  I kno that i can trust him with anything and everything,  Its crazy.  Almost odd. I mean, Jessie and brett are always there for me but its a different kind of frienship wisth josh.  I think were going through simialr things and were intrapersonal (i learned that word today) so were in touch iwh our emotions adn weve got so much in common we naturally flow.  i dont know how to explain it.  Im just so glad that we got talking again.  A lot of people have 'given up' on me or just left my life and im always afriad of htat.  But withJhosh, i have a feeling that hes not going to be like that.  No matter what happens, i kno that were going to be ok.  Why?  I have no idea.  Its just there.  I just know hes going to be there for me.It like one of the only things im sure of.   


Im sorry youre so confused right now josh... i cant imagine how rough everything is for you right noonow.  Just kno that ill be there for you, ok?  Ill listen whatever time of the day, no matter what else is going on.  I hope you know that.  I kno that youll do the right thing.  You're not going to let anyone down.  I love you josh! :-D

"event","Today was alittle bit better.  I just let everything go from yesterday.  I really dont care. Well i do, but i knew if i said something more that I would be the one wrong and thats not fair.  Yea, i am totally left out ALL the time, but too many things happened at home last night that the last thing i need is a fight in school too.  Yea, theres ALOT of tension between us... well actully jill and bill vs me, but o well.  Dont care anymore.  One day theyll relize what theyre doing.  But until then, ill just take the daily emotional beatings.  The cuts will turn into scabs one day.

But anyways, today was survivable.  I think its casue steve talked to me...willingly. I miss him a lot and having him come up to ME was AWSOME.  He stayed for like 5 mins, but thats great.  I havent talked him really sience aug before we broke up.  And i miss talking to him. I dont think he knows that either. But i understand why things are so hard for us.  I understand.  I just want things to be back to normal-whatever normal is. He even saw me in lunch.  I really wish that we could hang out tho.  I miss that.  Not as bf and gf tho of course, just friends.  I want to get to kno him again casue i miss him like crazy.  our friednship was and will always be really important to me.   I just hope he knows that i care about him as  a friend and i hpe that one day we can get back to a good place between us.  I wish i could tell him what i could before, but i dont think he wants that kind of a friendship right now.  So rite now im just gonna sit back and be patient about it.  Today was just a good sign for our frienshp to be better again.  I cant wait for the day when its good again.  But ill wait.
I came to a lot of conclusions today.  I think ive been hurting myself and someone else for sometime now and im sure that person agrees.  infact i kno that person would agreee.  So yea, im gonna take care of that.

Oh yea.... i found someting out rreally sad.  Someone that im friends with said something that was TOTALLY false about me an someone else and i almost started cying.  That person made up something that they nkow is false-in fact, its something about them thats true.  So try being my friend ok?  IF yo ont want to b, then tell me.   Why would you do that to me?

So Josh mde me smile too.  we had a great convo.  He said like some of the nicdests things ever that made me smnile.  But one thing we foudn out: our kids would have no paience.  lol.  So theyre screwed.  Josh is gonna teach outr little girl to beat up boys too.  Then shes gonna call hima on her cell and hes gona make em into a speed bump.  lol  So yea. were onna be awsome parents.  All i can say is i love you josh."

And people are allowed to have their own opionions Bill.  although Jill doesnt, most people do.  I never ONCE said that i didnt support you.  so fuck you.  how dare you jump at me like that.  who do you think you are?  ive always been there for you when i shouldve taken care of myself.  so why dont you stop thinking their youre in a nazi prision camp and look at the real pciture and stop making things up for symathy.  how dare you even imply that i dont care.  but no, youd never yelled at jill. never ever ever ever ever.  Nope.  Shes ALWAYS RIGHT.

So yea....anyone else who bothers to read this that im jelous.  Well, to a degree i am. Ill admit it. But you guys dont live this life.  How would you feel if you thought you had CANCER they didnt even call after the tests to see if you were ok.  how would that feel??  If it was one of my friedns, i wouldve been at the hospital WITH THEM holding their hands.  But no, you two were prolly talking on the phone.  THE DOCTORS THOUGHT I COULD HAVE HAD A BRAIN TUMOR.  But dont be there for me.  No. Thaat wouldve been dumb.

Back to Jill, im sorry that my outfit didnt get apporved on your list.  Kiss my ass.  You may not have brought up the gothic thing, but you did agree.  And then you said something about my nails.  FUCK IT.  Im sorry that i didnt dress the way you wanted me to.  Im sorry that i wasnt covered in pink bows with flowers.  I never got that memo.

I dont even know why i concider you two my friends casue right about now, youre far from it.  You both yell at me all the time and youre never hapy with me.  when im sad fuck me.  I thought you were supposed to HELP me, not talk about me behind me back.  when im happy its for the wrong reasons. (josh....joel....never good enough, huh?)  I cant belive you two!  I NEVER do ANYTHING right.  I dont even see why i bother with you two anymore. Friends forever, huh?  i mustve been left out of that equation.  You mustve ment Jill+Bill=Friends    I was never in that equation to begin with. 

             ...Im sorry im not the person you want me to be..."

"event","Well today has a rough day.  I was yelled at by rachel and i was crying at like 6 am, so thats never good.  So anyways, i called josh at 615 like i promised and he made me laugh.  Hmmm, i dont remember what we were talking about tho.  lol. if i remember ill tell you.  Oh yea- he wrote a peom which kicked ass. lol. i was really good josh, and i mean it. And so are the other ones you wrote.  The rose one was the best.  I feel like a dead rose too.... its a really good analogy and im very proud of you.
I dont know what im feeling lately.  Its like one minuete i feel happy, and one min im scared.  I guess im scared that someones gonna get up and leave my life.  Idk....my brain is alway thinking about things and it never gives me a break.  Its getting kinda old.  I just wanna close my eyes and open them and have everything fixed infront of me.  But odviously that cant happen.  Im just sick of being compared to people.  Im me...im no one else.  Im not someones ex girfriend or someone else who has hurt someone in the past.  I guess im so weary of somethings is becasue like ive said, i dont want to be a rebound.  I dont expect people to be like 'this is how i feel for you....' and spill it all out.  Cause i cant do that, and i wouldnt expect that of anyone else.  Thats just the way it is, all i ask is please dont say something you dont mean.  Everyone, some people in particular, please be careful of what you say to me Cause i might just go out and belive it.  So dont promsise forever unless you really mean it, and dont tell me you want to hold me if you dont plan on it for awhile.  If youre not sure, just tell me.  im not looking for a realtionshp thatll last forever, but i want one that has that potential.  I dont want to be the gf who was in ur life for a while.  I hope you undertand that its gonna be awhile before we can be becasue of me.  Im not going to get into something that i cant handle and im not about to hurt you like others did in the past.  As some people have noticed, i built an emotional barrier built up and its gonna be hard for me to love again.  So i guess im just asking is to say what you mean, and say it if you know its not just going to be for today.  Cause thatll hurt me too much...i dont want things to change from that to something eles in like a day.... i dont kno if i could handle it.  So i guess what im trying to say is dont say things you dont mean, and when you really do feel them, please tell me.  I wont hurt you.  Ill give you all i can.  Right now, I can promise you my friendship, thats what i need right now.  I need someone who understands me and my feelings and wil understadn that i make mistakes, and thatswhat you are right now.  You havent rushed things...youre takin em slow and i appreciate that so much.  I feel safe with you...something ive never felt before.  Im sorry if its hard for my emotions to come out sometimes, as you can see its easier for me to write them out.  So i apologize.  But i promise that once we can trust eachother enough, and put the past in the past....well be together hand-and-hand.  My heart wants to be loved by someone like YOU."

"event","Happy Halloween! :-D  Oh man, trick or treating was amazing. It made me laugh so much. Brett, Jason, Jessie and Joel were so much fun...and of course my mommy.  hehe.  We all went together adn had an amazing time.  My mom said that Joel was too old to go get candy, but he could come with us. So my mom and joel followed us and they talked and i guess really got along.  She told him that i ruined the  chance of us going out right now by not telling my mom when we kissed at the haunted house adn tehn in my backyard.  She told him that i had 5 days and that she gave my 100 opurtunities to tell her, but i didnt.  I was going to tell her sunday, which i did, but i guess my 5 days expired on Saturday night.  So yea, that kinda sucks that my mom said that, but theres nothing i can do.  Ive odviously made my mistakes.... that and mike didnt help anything, but i cant erase them.  I would erase mike if i could, buyt i cant and ive found forgivness in myself.  That was the worst thing thqat ive ever done, but i cant do anything about it.  But anyways, my mom said to Joel that theres the future for us, but for right now, im just too yung.  Buit its all good Im having a blast rite nopw anyways.
So trick or treating was so much fun We all got along except for like2 seconds, but thats ok.  We were just overtired.  Thats the last time ill be able to go trick or treating, os enjoyed the hell out of mnyself.
I also got to see Josh today! :-D  we had a good time.  WE were only together for like a half an hour, but imglad that i got that. WE gget along so good, its like he knows exactly what im going to say and he knows what to say to me.  Healwasy makes me feel better about things....when im with him, i dont have to worry about anything and i can just be myeself.  Not many people can do that to me.  
So i guess an era just ended, but i guess thats part of growing up. Its sad, but its what happens.  If things gdont change then well miss out on what lifes realyl out.  Im just gald that we can just go out and have a good time and enjoy ourselves.  If we didnt, then what would be the point.  I guess hteres just those people who make you fell whole again.
And its you."

"event","Ok...well ive got like a couple mins so i can actully write.  Im so busy latley, so im gonna try ot keep it updated!  (unlike josh lol)
SOrry to anyone if ive been alittle pissy latley.  Im just under so much stress.  From the dumb yearbook to grades to friends to 'friends' to family to just myself, ive just been rally confused but i shouldnt be takin in out on people i love.
I decided that im not going to be a lawyewr.  After that dumb frield trip,  dont think i wanna put that much stress on myesle.f  I want a job where i love going to work, and i dont think that that would be the optimial proffession for me.  I think-actully i kno-im gonnabe a teachrer.  I love little kids so much.  A lot of people dont have the patience to do that, but i do.  I have no patience for puizzles or anythign like tat, butwith little kids i do.  They make me happy.  I love it when i can make them feel better.  So yea-im going to go to Canisus for elemtarry teaching.  
Hmmm...what else has been going on?  la-la-la-la, im trying to think.  Oh yea.... i wish people would let me talk for myself.  People-dont put words in people's mouth.  If theres a relationship between two people, then keep it that way.  If tis between three people, then kepp it between the three people.  So everybody just calm down and pay attention to your own lives.
I wish that i was happy.  I mean, its not like im suicical or depressional, but still.  I dont want to have work at things anymore.  Why cant it just be like a fairytale?  Oh yea-theres no such thing, i forgot.  Silly Sarah.  I dont kno, i just want my life to be allitel easier.  I mean nothing looks good from my view.  Jessies graduaating this year (which, if you kno  me, means that Ill be completly lost,) the next year im graducationg, brettt and I are going to differnt collages, and im just afraid.  Its bad enough that i lost Jason, but there goes another.  Ah man, lets stop talking about this, im gonna get sad.
So hmm, something good.  I get to have an amazng weekend again!  On friday i have the halloween party !  :-D  and then on saturday afternoon i get to see josh which will for sure put me ina  super-de-duper mood, and then i get to go to shandas with joel (i think) and have fun there. So its allgood.  It shoudl be a great weekend. 
I think part of my proublem is that i dont wanna be a rebound gf.  Been there done that and look where i am.  People keep warning me, but cant i feel what i feel?  Why isnt it ok to belive in love?  I think what we 'have' is real, whatever it is. well sweetie, you kno who you are, and thank you for making me smile even when you dont want to.  I dont care if no one else wants belives that its real or thinks imbeing dumb...cause to be honest, i dont understadn it eaither, but i think you do.  I think you know what all this means.  Deep down i think we both do if wed just push everyone else to this side.  So just remember this:
              ""Never apologize for saying what you mean
                      Cause thats like youre saying your sorry
            For being real."""

"event","I wish people ould jsut be honest.  Seriously.  I mean,come on.  Why cant people just say how they feel and stop going around it. Its so old.  why cant you all just come straight out and be like ""hey-youre wrong"" or ""youre rite"" instead of going around it.  My god, if you dont like me, just tell me.  And if you do, dont only say it but mean it.  Please just stop lying me. 

Also, enough with the whole ""ill love you forever.""  i mean, seriosuly.  How can people even say that?  im glad no one is saying that to me.  Cause i dont want people lying to me.  It just pisses me off when i read people profiles and theyre like ""ill love yu forever"" come on.  The people bearley know eachtoher and theyre swearing their unconditional love?  Give it up.  MEAN what you say.  DOnt lie. In two weeks, theyll be on to soemone new. Love isnt a fairytale, so dont make it up to be something its not.  See it how it is.  I kno that you have to try in love and im not going to pretend somethings perfect when it not. 
im just sick and tired of being promised forever when that only means a couple months of their lives.  Only promise forever and that
youll be through hardtimes if you mean it.

I know how hard love can be...and i dont mind working for it.  I dont kno, its not like any of this really realated to my life, but i see those profiles and i wanna gag. Wow-do i sound bitter or what?  I think i need to go to bed.  

Oh yea-I just wish that people would be happy for me when i find something and to let me enoy it.  it may not make sence to some people, but let me fall in love and stop judgingh me.  Theres always something wrong with my desisions, its never good enough.  Just keep judging me. You dont know what i feel like when im with him. Bye.  I need to go to bed.







ps this whole ""bitching"" its not towards josh, joel, jessie or brett"

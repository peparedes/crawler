"event","WOW!!! relay for life  was so much fun!!! i was bouncing off the walls cuz of all the coffee.  i think matt suffered from my insanity the most.  sorry matt.  b, u would have been so proud of me.  i was just sprinting around the track at 3 in the morning singing yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me.  

i also wrote those lovely words on my texts w/ b. me and my phone bonded wut with my texts to b and calls to the beach kids and casey (I'm so happy for you ;)).  

cameron and i bring out the worst in each other lol.  i also found it really ironic that our conversations with taylor were WAY cleaner then they were with matt.  (michelle, it wasnt his fault.....it was all the sugar lol).  

i like smores.  so does jillson ma but in a diff kind of way.  wink wink.  OMG jill- the article in teen people w/ simple plan- it got....it got......thrown away.  *cries bloody eyes out*  i was sooooooooo sad.  just so u know, it was the summer 2004 issue, so it was NEW!!! i think we should buy it.  

the people magazine also did well this month.....the cover, as b and kelsey very well know, has our fav. elf/pirate/wimpy hot guy in troy on it.  ""he's a pirate"" lol.  wut else is there to report....not much i guess.  o ya, gym kids, we had some disapointing news about something CLEAN that has to do w/ air and soap and h2o. grrrrrrrr.  but thats ok cuz the beach crew saw some kool stuff.

i thinnk part of the reason that i luved relay so much is that i learned something about ljcd this year, and high school in general.  i stopped trying to b friends w/ people who didnt treat me how i deserved.  now i just do wut makes me happy, and i really dont care.  i actually have fun now.  

ne way, kayla, i got some good practice for next new years, but this time (as much as we all love yellowcard) u r gonna turn it off so u can stay up all nite eating ur dads fudge and listening to me and colleen educating kels about the sexual dangers of sweatshops. lol.  

newayz, ive only slept 3 out of the last 35 hours, so i think i shall go take a nap.

luv ya,
morgan"

all stars health kick is now well underway and i have decided that studmuffins are totally allowed lol.  i went to whole foods yesterday to buy healthy stuff and the guys that work there........lets just say that its like the diving on tv lol.  good idea jillson.


i have now seen PoA 3 times (and counting) and i LOVE IT!!!  dan is cool lol.  he almost fainted in the dementor scene w/ sirius.  haha.  how like his character.  my new fav song is hero by nickelback.  i think they should play that when he jumps out and does tha patronus.  ooo, that reminds me.  does ne one have the 1st spiderman on DVD so i can borrow it?

"event","i feel so cool.  i went to cameron's house w/ michelle and it was so awesome.  we swam for like 3 hours and the pool was like a jacuzzi.  i was humming bolero, which will probly be my floor music, (its way diff than colleen's) and cameron was like ""bolero""  and i was like, wow, u r smart.  and then she played it on the flute.  :)  i was like WOW.

"event","hi!  sorry there hasnt been much to write.  also, this will probly be short cuz i could use some sleep.  i slept today the whole drive from the chiroprators to gym.  the chirppractor makes me cry cuz it hurts my shins so bad!!!  shin splints are the devil.

gym has been way better lately even tho i am still scared of flight.  so i will wrote wut  i wrote in my profile a long time ago.  basically, all i need to know is that it is exactly the same as low beam and that people make waay to big of a deal out of it.  honestly, its just like the low beam and i freak myself out for no reason.

also at gym:  we hosted the milkyway classic last weekend and it was so much fun!!!! i was the announcer and i was all like:  hello everybody and welcome to the 6th annual millkyway classic.  your teams for this evening are:......    i am so ready fro speech this summer lol

ummm our bathrooms broke at gym so we had to walk to a different shopping center at break like everydayand so we went to a bedroom store and sat on the couches and stuff while reading motivational sayings.  shaun was so proud lol.

any other gym stuff.....im gonna wear soffes tomorrow cuz i am being rebellious.  b gave me some cool new leos uz she is cool....also, starting next week any all star optionals that want to are going on our team diet:  health food guyS!!!!  no more of that pat and oscars i ate for lunch today (first time in forever, dont yell at me pleez.)  actually, i like my balance bars better anyway.  too bad we have an art party tomorrow.  well, it starts next week anyway.

school~  key club lunch was good.  i hung out with cool people, but wow is there a lack of guys at that place.  thats ok.  michelle rox my world.  matt knows something i don't but i dont know wut.  grrrrrrrrrrrrr.  well, he is very trustworthy w/ secrets, thats for sure lol.  i think thats all for now cuz i am tired.  naptime.  sweet dreams.  ""watch you smile while u r sleeping, while ur far away and dreaming......"

"event","aaaaaaaagh.  hugest wrist rip ever!!! thats ok tho, cuz bars was good.  i did some giants and toe shoots and stuff.  on beam i do a gainer off the end, cuz my roundoffs scare the heck out of me!!!!  but i know that if i ever need a roundoff i c an relearn it fairly quickly and thats good to know.  

good luck to all my buddies competing high school: b, emily, casey, jillson, colleen, kayla.  kick @$$!!!!  (dont u love how sheltered i am.

when i was warming up today, zoee was there and we bonded.  no one else was there that she likes better (everyone basically) so we played.  she was Sooooooooo hyper.  then later she crashed and fell asleep.  remind u of anyone?  speaking of sleep, im gonna go get some.  sorry the entries are kind of boring, but im tired, so c ya later!!!!

"event","today was such a better day.  i did not accomplish my goal:  i still cried, but that was cuz i was in a considerable amount of pain at the chiropractor's.  he put A TON of pressure on my shin right where it hurts and i had to flex my foot.  i wanted to die!!!!

gym was way better today tho.  i did 6 for 6 backhandsprings on high beam and i went for straddle backs w/o the sting mat.  i still had a spot, but i was going to handstand and everything so it was cool.  floor was hard.  cause i cant twist and it makes me mad lol.  i was all like, im gonna give it all ive got.  cuz its all ive got.   all ive got wasnt good enough, but thats ok.

it was so sad tho today.  kelsey keeps pretending to be mad at me, but even tho i know she's pretending, its almost heartbreaking, cuz shees not smiling the happy little kelsey smile.  and kayla was down too.  we need to smile, because smiles spread like bunnies.  

im gonna go read devil wears prada and then to bed.  night

"event","ya.  i was kind of depressed today.  i think i figured out why.  its almost like i have multiple personalities( dont laugh) and the pissy, crying depressed one has been showing more and more, and i just let it.  i need to stick w/ my happy side, no matter wut happens.  i need to remember kaylaism. :)  

so, i coulnt make giants, which sux cuz i competed them all year and got a 9.5 on that routine and all, but i guess i should focus on how i made a couple last week.

then i freaked out on beam.  its like, i couldnt picture myself going, i just thought i would collapse or die or something.  then when i got off i wanted to faint.  ummm, if i could ask all readers one favor, please dont tell me , ""at least u only have to do one handspring"" because that just makes me more sad b/c the one still stresses me out and im afraid i wont get flight for next year.  i finally did one at the end, and it didnt feel so bad.  goal for tomorow: dont cry during gym, and be social during school, try to make more friends.

""if i could find you now, things would get better,
we could leave this town and run forever,
so let your waves crash down on me and take me away""

here's the plan of action:i gather all my closest friends (all stars of course and michelle w and whoever else is nice to me and really cares) and we can just go.  not far just away for a week or two, to forget about the problems of daily life.

heres a funny note to leave u on:
after i had crashed like 4 times on clear hips (which were actually really good until i crashed) kelsey and mary were talking about the guys they like and me and jill and colleen and casey were talking about people using code names (i luv skittles lol)  and shaun says to us:  ""u guys are too young for boys.""  ya, that kind of cracked us up.  :)"

"event","haha.  kelsey is a weird kid in the best possible way.  michelle biaggi and i are really mature at gym ;) and were speaking about some, um stuff, in french.  and kelsey pretended to be mad at me and she writes this whole  thing about how she got me gooooooooooooood.  lol.  kelson rocks like Lee!!!!

also, kayla and i decided that we are willing to share our b-day extravaganza w/ tom felton (9/22/87).  i need to use the good eye more, b/c there was a pic online of tom, but it was really his head on someone else's body, and i couldnt tell lol.  i was like, ""that looks prettty nice.  he has good biceps"".  kayla's good vision brought me back to reality."

"event","hi!  this is my new live journal.  its probly pretty boring cuz im one of those paranoid people that is afraid of being stalked by scary internet people.  ne wayz, thats not the point but w/e.

umm, this weekend i had fun.  i went to michelle's house and then i had a b-day party for colleen and b and mary adn pierre lol. i like to swim in the pool late at night.  

i really dont know why im writing right now other than to procrastinate studying for world cultures.  im really over school right now.  im sick of being stressed and im sick of living just for those 4 hours a day i spend at gym.  (yes, i actually like gym.  weird isnt it?)
not too much more tho, till im free.

sorry this is such a boring entry.  ill write better stuff later, so dont give up hope.  more interesting stuff later (i hop, for ur sake)

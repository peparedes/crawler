"event","You'd think I&nbsp;died, I&nbsp;post like...one freaking thing then, gone. I&nbsp;don't even know why I'm posting NOW but, I&nbsp;just feel the need.
&nbsp;Day before yesterday, I&nbsp;saw a chicken peck a dead chicken, and another peck a dying one. I&nbsp;did not know it was dying, you think you're so embittered but then you're left screaming &quot;What is wrong with you?!&quot; at a chicken. It flapped around on the ground...before that I&nbsp;thought it was dead.
 I always think, what with my belief in an afterlife, reincarnation...that death wouldn't trouble me so much but it always does. Maybe only sociopaths are completely unfazed by death.
&nbsp;Oh, btw, too, finding the freakin chickens was the same day as my nephew's bris. It was just, happy event, talking with people, then, bam dead chickens. Also trekking through the woods in a dress, pantyhose and boots (changed out of the...platform, clog things I&nbsp;wore), searching for live chickens. Actually did find the two that were missing, alive.
&nbsp;It's just a weird shift...this additional part of my personality. I now care about chickens (some I&nbsp;even find cute)...when the fuck does THAT&nbsp;happen?

...Now here's a weird urge...just this, twitch that wants to do something violent. Hm...now see, video games and movies can be useful, I'm able to act out this urge in a virtual setting and/or experience it vicariously without worrying about the messy cleanup."

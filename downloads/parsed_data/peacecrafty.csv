Things are settling down again, although I'm not sure whether I can use the term normal to describe my life at present. Truth be known, I'm not sure what defines normality anymore. The past few weeks have been a blur, and I've lost all track of time. I'm very tired even though I am sleeping, but both Tomas and I are doing much better than we were.

It's quieter now Quatre and Trowa have left. I miss their company. Their support, as with everyones was very much appreciated, and sorely needed.

Thank you too, to everyone who offered support and advice.

Rest in Peace, dear Peygan. You will always hold a special place in my heart."

*glances over to the bed where Tomas is still sleeping*

I can't help but think that I'm being very self-centred in allowing myself to wallow in self pity like this especially after what happened last night with Tomas.

It's a very humbling experience having the man you love crying in your arms and there's nothing you can do to make it better. He's lost the last of those he calls family, and he's not handling the situation well.

In public he's quiet, and putting on a brave face. He seems to feel that he has to live up to a standard with my family and friends even though I've told him that they will understand.

Last night he came to bed, and put his arms around me. He was shaking, and I stroked his hair. He leaned in closer and lost all that was left of his self control. I don't know how long we lay there holding each other, but we both cried at least a week's worth of tears before finally allowing sleep to claim us.

I need to go. Tomas is stirring and I don't want him to wake up alone."

"event","I've spent the last week at the hospital after my visit to Aspen was cut short by a phone call from Tomas. Peygan collapsed last Monday, and was rushed to hosptial after suffering a massive heart attack.

He's been unconscious for the most part, since he was admitted, except for twice when he opened his eyes, smiled at us, and then closed them again.

He's growing weaker, and I'm scared he's not going to recover.

I've already watched one father die, I don't know if I have the strength to do it again. 

I'm also worried about Tomas. Peygan has been more of a father to him than an uncle, taking him and his mother in after his father died, and then providing comfort for Tomas when his mother passed away a few years later. 

He's very quiet, and I know he's trying to be strong but I'm not sure how long he can keep doing this. I might try to get him away from the hospital for an hour or so, just to get him to open up and talk, but I worry that if I do and something happens while we are gone, neither of us would ever forgive ourselves."

How do you know if you're falling in love with someone? I'm really not sure. All I know is that I want to see where our new found relationship takes us, spend all the time with him I can, and that I miss him when he's not around.

Tomas makes me feel special. I often find myself smiling at the memory of a touch, a whisper, a comment. I've had relationships before and they have failed for various reasons. I pray that this time things will work out. I think I've finally found someone I can imagine myself growing old with and it's a wonderful yet scary feeling.

Naturally I couldn't make his trip a total waste so after I explained the situation, which he found quite amusing, I offered to take him out for dinner for his trouble.

We had a wonderful evening, and during dinner he finally admitted that it was he who has been leaving me the flowers and other gifts.

<i>At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart:
And as the last slow sudden drops are shed
From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled,
So singly flagged the pulses of each heart.
Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start
Of married flowers to either side outspread
From the knit stem; yet still their mouths, burnt red,
Fawned on each other where they lay apart.

Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams,
And their dreams watched them sink, and slid away.
Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams
Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day;
Till from some wonder of new woods and streams
He woke, and wondered more: for there she lay</i>

It's Nuptial Sleep, by Dante Gabriel Rosetti. I spent hours memorising the poem for school, and although I can't quote it now from memory, it's one I will always recognise.

I suspect the person who left this for me knows that, if it's who I suspect, as I seem to remember complaining to him about having to do so at the time.

I keep telling myself that I'm a strong person, that I don't need someone else to be happy, but it's not working as well as it should be.

We're comfortable with each other; with my friends I can be myself and relax. There's no need to worry about the correct way of doing things, or what others think. They accept me for who I am - with no concerns for my position - and I accept them for who they are in return. 

I do regret having lost touch over the past few years, but they have accepted that too, without question. It's been my own loss, and I'm determined - one could almost call it a New Years Resolution if I believed in such things, which I don't - not to let my work detain me from keeping in regular contact with my friends, with my family. 

On a lighter note, although I'm sure Trowa would disagree with me...Dorothy has a weird sense of humour. She is well aware that Trowa does not feel entirely comfortable around her, and she has made it her mission to wander past him, while he is here, eating various pieces of fruit while in the process of cutting said fruit with small sharp objects. They pass each other, exchange very cool greetings and keep walking. I know she's doing it on purpose, but she denies it of course.

Trowa's going to try to persuade him to try to get some sleep but I can't see any of us getting much in the way of sleep tonight. 

I know I won't be."

It's wonderful to see old friends again, although I must admit my concerns over recent events *frowns* I wish there was more I could do to help; it's times like this that I feel extremely inadequate, especially as my friends are all so very capable. I've been told that I shouldn't feel this way, that my skills lie in other directions, but even so...

In saying that though, I do not mean to imply that I am wholly unable to defend myself, or protect those I care about. I still remember how to use a gun, although I prefer not to use one unless neccessary,  but I have learnt over recent years that there are those who will not allow themselves to be reasoned with. It is a shame that there are still people out there who will lower themselves to this kind of behaviour to further their own agenda. 

On a brighter note - my costume is still safely packed at the bottom of my suitcase. It would rather spoil the surprise if others were to see it ahead of time.

My brother's reaction should be especially interesting..."

There are several with great potential, though I do wonder as to Dorothy's motives for applying. She didn't mention that she was planning to when we spoke the other day.

But then, Dorothy has always liked to keep me on my toes, and I don't expect that to change anytime soon."

I am very pleased to be here.

Quatre, if you need to contact me further, please use my home number. I have arranged for the calls to be forwarded to me no matter where I am. *frowns* I am fairly certain that you have it; if you don't, Heero definitely does. 

My apologies again for not receiving your initial calls. The matter has been dealt with and I am presently without a personal assistant until I can find a replacement for Roger. *sighs* I still can't believe how foolish I was to believe that I could trust that man. But then, I mistakely also believed that our agreement to end our relationship was a mutual one.

Either he is a better liar than I thought, or...

Regarding the current situation, unfortunately it would be difficult for me to leave Cinque at present, but if I am needed, I will be there.

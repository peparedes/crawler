From the place that I'll be landing?""

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,
There's nothin' I'm wishing to be ownin'.
Just to carry yourself back to me unspoiled,
From across that lonesome ocean.

""Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden,
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona.""

And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.

And it's only that I'm askin',
Is there something I can send you to remember me by,
To make your time more easy passin'.""

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,
It only brings me sorrow.
The same thing I would want today,
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship a-sailin',
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
But with the country to where you're goin'.

So take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."

"event","I think this lyric is particularly beautiful...it is the first in Hart Crane's long poem ""The Bridge,"" published in 1933. 


How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest
The seagull's wing shall dip and pivot him,
Shedding white rings of tumult, building high
Over the chained bay waters Liberty--

Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes
As apparational as sails that cross
Some page of figures to be filed away;
--Till elevators drop us from our day...

I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights
With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene
Never disclosed, but hastened to again,
Foretold to others eyes on the same screen;

And Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced
As though the sun took step of thee, yet left
Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,--
Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!

Out of subway scuttle, cell or loft
A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,
Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,
A jest falls from the speechless caravan.

Down Wall, from girder into streen noon leaks,
A rip-tooth of the sky's acetylene;
All afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn...
Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.

And obscure as that heaven of the Jews,
Thy guerdon...Accolade thou dost bestow
Of anonymity time cannot raise:
Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.

O harp and altar, of the fury fused,
(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)
Teriffic threshold of the prophet's pledge,
Prayer of pariah, and the lover's cry,--

Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift
Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,
Beading thy path -- condense eternity:
And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.

Under thy shadow by the piers I waited;
Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.
The city's fiery parcels all undone,
Already snow submerges an iron year...

O Sleepless as the river under thee,
Vaulting the sea, the prairies' dreaming sod,
Unto us lowliest sometimes sweep, descend
And of the curveship lend a myth to God.

What do I care
that the stream is trampled,
the sand on the stream-bank
still holds the print of your foot:
the heel is cut deep.
I see another mark
on the grass ridge of the bank--
it points toward the wood-path.
I have lost the third
in the packed earth.

But here
a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped:
the purple buds--half ripe--
show deep purple
where your heel pressed.

A patch of flowering grass,
low, trailing--
you brushed this:
the green stems show yellow-green
where you lifted--turned the earth-side
to the light:
this and a dead leaf-spine,
split across,
show where you passsed.

You were swift, swift!
here the forest ledge slopes--
rain has furrowed the roots.
Your hand caught at this;
the root snapped under your weight.

I can almost follow the note
where it touched this slender tree
and the next answered--
and the next.

And you climbed yet further!
you stopped by the dwarf-cornel--
whirled on your heels,
doubled on your track.

This is clear--
you fell on the downward slope,
you dragged a bruised thigh--you limped--
you clutched this larch.

Did you head, bent back,
search further--
clear through the green leaf-moss
of the larch branches?

Did you clutch, 
stammer with short reath and gasp:
wood-daemons grant life--
give life--I am almost lost.

For some wood-daemon
has lightened your steps.
I can find no trace of you
in the larch-cones of the underbrush."

"event","It's time for my biannual LJ entry. Last time I was furious, this time I'm impossibly excited for my upcoming 21st birthday. Being that it is technically August 22nd, I will be turning 21 TOMORROW. Yes, on Thursday August 23rd, Nathan Strobel will be 21.

Eva and I were strolling through the beer section in Giant today picking out preferred beverages, discussing possible liquors fit for purchase, and purchasing mixers for said liquors, and despite this very tangible activity, I'm still in utter awe of the fact that I'm going to be a full legal adult.

In a way I find it rather depressing that this is my last milestone birthday before I turn 30, have a full-time job, and start joking about how I haven't aged a day since 28. But whaddya gonna do. I'm rather torn on this growing up thing. I'd like to have a (large) house with Eva, two dogs, two cats, two kids, and a Mercedes. I'd also like it if my parents gave me money all the time with no strings attached so I can just sit around and read teen dating message boards all day. Unfortunately, that's not likely to happen.

In the spirit of preparing for this inevitability, I've gotten a job at the Free Lance-Star which is stressful, confusing, and anxiety-producing but ultimately fulfilling, I believe. Open the sports page and look at all the scores, box scores, and short summaries of high school volleyball matches that no one ever looks at. That's me. It's an entry level job now (albeit a pretty goddam hard and actually pretty important one) so that I can actually get something decent after graduation. At the beginning I was incredibly anxious and dour about the whole ordeal, but I've come to terms with it and even if I don't love it, I think it will fit into a routine and will ultimately be quite beneficial. So whatever.

Just a few days ago I wanted to quit and just keep the mindless desk aid job at school that I applied for last year, but Eva was able to talk some sense into me, and now I'm glad she did because I'm starting to feel more comfortable with it.

Anyways, I hope everyone has a fantastic school year, good day."

"event","I know this is shocking to those of you on my friends list (all 3 of you) but I'm actually updating my lj. I just need a place to vent.

I would just like to say that I HATE my neighbor. HATE HATE HATE my neighbor. I hate him with the white hot intensity of 1000 burning suns. I hope he chokes on broken glass and/or suffers an aortic dissection, preferably at the same time. I am not exaggerating. Those of you who know me are aware that I'm a pretty (VERY) laidback guy. Not much shakes me. Suffice it to say that I AM shaken tonight, very much so.

I won't go into detail, because the offense comes across as being far less egregious than it actually is. The situation is greater than the sum of its parts.

I loathe almost every aspect of living in a dorm. It is the absolute antithesis of my personality. I could live at home, but all said, that would suck almost as much as living on campus. This hall was bearable before HE moved in, but now I spend practically every evening grinning and bearing it until I can force myself to sleep. I need more Xanax, seriously.

Next year Ricky, Eric, and I are moving ONE ROOM (from 414 to 413) because this is the only hall on campus with male triples. I hope to God that my neighbor isn't homesteading. Seriously, everyone pray for me. It would be slightly better because we wouldn't be directly next door to him, but the thought of living within 20 feet of him again next year makes me ill.

Why do I attract people like this? Bad luck? Am I being punished? I don't know. All I want is quiet. Last year I was stuck with a raging alcoholic for a roommate who had his friends over to drink 40s literally every single night. And I lived with that all year, no complaints! I even got an alcohol citation and had to go to the JRB because he and his friends got caught drinking! Jesus Christ. 

I could deal with him. Honestly, once I got used to the whole routine, I could just put on my headphones and drown them out. Even he is kind of a loser (read: huge loser) I still feel that my old roommate was a genuinely nice guy; just a serious alcoholic/pothead. He wasn't a sociopath like my current neighbor is. This kid is literally the typecast serial killer. It is frightening.

I forgot to mention why he is even here. He got kicked out of his former school for walking down the street in nothing but a thong carrying a bong. Yes, seriously.

But Christ, what I wouldn't give to spend some QUIET TIME with Eva on say a Friday night, and go to sleep without having to turn on a fan in an attempt to drown out the horde of drunks alternately blasting drinking songs and screaming.

I fantasize constantly about having a nice little place with Eva where I can do all of the above and actually, like, read a book in some semblance of peace and maybe fall asleep before 3am every night. I also want a dog.

Why is it that a dorm atmosphere is 100% antithetical to learning anything? It makes no sense to me. What happened to the best and the brightest? A majority of the people that live in this dorm seem to be just as stupid as many of the stupid rednecks I thought I left behind in high school. At least they KNEW they were dumb.

I don't mean to sound like an asshole (yes I do, what the hell am I talking about) but I am so fucking sick of so many people on this campus. I am sick to death of the stupid douchebags whose interests on facebook are ""beer, parties, and shit like dat"", whose favorite music is ""anything that gets me pumped, yea boi!"" and whose favorite books are ""yea i dont read much"". Seriously, how the hell did these people get into college. When I was in high school I thought college was like, you know, smart people doing smart things. Don't get me wrong, there are more than enough extremely intelligent and cultured people on this campus that I greatly admire, but they ARE vastly outnumbered.

I guess I've just become quite disenfranchised with the whole song and dance. Most people don't go to college to learn, they go to college 1) because there is lots of alcohol and 2) because their parents are willing to pay 20,000+ dollars for a piece of paper.

This started as a diatribe against my neighbor and ended as a diatribe against stupid people. I don't consider them the same. The kid next door to me is in a class by himself. At least the people I mentioned above have SOME redeeming value, and most of them are actually nice enough people. They just piss me off and I'm especially pissed off right now because it is almost 3am and I should have been asleep two hours ago. But the neighbor is absolute scum. I can't come up with strong enough epithets to describe my hatred for him.

That is all, goodnight."

I attribute much of my musical growth to the Beatles, John in particular...The impression that his songs made on my teenage ears will never be forgotten. ""1"" blew my mind, and shortly after I bought it, I went out and got every Beatles album I could get my hands on. The summer between sophomore and junior year of high school, I would sit in my room and listen to the White Album all the way through on a nightly basis...every chord is permanently ingrained in my consciousness. The album contains my favorite musical moment by a country mile; Ringo's pained scream of ""I got blisters on my fingers!"" at the end of Helter Skelter. If that ain't fucking hardcore, I don't know what is. It was like they made the album just for me. Revolution 9 would creep the living hell out of me...""number 9, number 9, number 9."" Then they'd lull me to sleep with Good Night. It was like a shot of espresso followed by a glass of chamomile tea. I wish I could go back to those days when I could be truly passionate about a CD or a band for months on end without itching to move onto something different. The Beatles just WERE to me...no influences, no arguments, nobody better, cooler, louder, more dynamic, or better live...they were just the fucking Beatles, and that was more than enough. I mean, I was so passionate about the Beatles, I wrote my application essay to UMW about how they affected my life.

My high school years without the companionship of Help!, Nowhere Man, Yer Blues, I Am The Walrus, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Revolution 9, In My Life, Tomorrow Never Knows, Julia, et al are unthinkable. So thank you for the music, John. I know you don't believe in Heaven, but maybe I'll see you on an alternate plane of existence someday.

By the way, I am fully aware that this is one day late. I just forgot to do it yesterday, because as you know, I don't exactly update my LJ faithfully."

"event","haha, ok Alyssa...I don't want to get into a pissfest about our musical tastes. I just felt like I needed to defend one of my favorite bands. I was just engaging in some friendly jousting with that thing on AIM anyway. But since I have a bit of time, I might as well refute a few of your points.

Who is saying that I rely on some ""ambiguous musical hierarchy"" to make myself look cooler? I like the music I like because its good music and it appeals to me. So be it if it makes me look cool. I do take pride in my CD collection because I've put a lot of time, thought, and money into it. I don't flaunt my musical tastes unless provoked. If I thought my music made me look cool, I would drive with my windows down...which I don't. I would also own a bunch of band t-shirts...which I don't. I'm happy to keep my music to myself, but when somebody attacks my music, its on.

I would have to disagree with your point that being well established does not result in some sort of clout. Going by this logic, Eminem would be on the same level as Bach or Mozart, and I think most people would agree that's not the case. If a band can stand the test of time, they're obviously still subject to the taste of the individual, but I think they do deserve a certain degree of respect for their longevity. If they can stay respected and in the public eye for that long, it obviously says something about their level of accomplishment. And its not like I ""only"" listen to older bands because they're somehow ""better"" just because they're old. Many of my favorite bands are newer bands, hell, even more recent than Linkin Park. Its just that I think Linkin Park sucks because they're commercial corporate drivel with no redeeming artistic value. There has to be a distinction between something created for the sake of the music and something created for the sake of fattening someone's wallet. Bands like Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, et al fall squarely into the latter category.

Snobbery is taking one stance in public and another in private. If I pretended to be a big Pixies, Sonic Youth, Velvet Underground etc. fan but just wore their t-shirts and never listened to the music, then not only would I be a poser, I would also be a snob. I never try to shove my tastes down someone's throat, I just make fun of them behind their back and snicker to myself when someone espouses how ""hardcore"" Slipknot is to me. I come across as a music snob because I probably am, but I'm not a bad snob. I just take pride in the music I listen to. Is that really so bad? I put serious effort into augmenting my music collection with fresh and exciting things to listen to, so I definitely feel like I'm more qualified to speak upon music than someone who just listens to what they hear on the radio. People are too quick to dismiss a strong, educated opinion as snobbery. Perhaps its personal insecurity. If my toilet is broken, I'm not going to try and fix it myself, I'm going to call the bloody plumber, and I'm not going to call him a toilet snob because he knows more about them than I do. If I have a friend who doesn't seek out music as passionately as I do, I'd be doing him a favor by introducing him to some new bands. Music is a matter of personal preference, but your personal preference is more respectable if you actually put some effort into cultivating a knowledge of the craft.

OK that's it, hope I made myself clear. :)"

"event","OK, true story time. This just happened like 30 minutes ago.

As Eva knows, Ricky and I go to McDonalds every night. Tonight Jon joined us. We were walking back down College Ave, and we hear a voice behind us say ""hey guys, can I talk to you for a second."" We turn around to see a black man with a band-aid on his head wearing a black sweatshirt and black sweatpants. We walk with him all the way down the street while he feeds us his cock and bull story. Suppoosedly he is a business owner from Woodbridge. He was travelling with his wife, and they got into a fight. She kicked him out and took the kids with her. He somehow ended up on College Ave and needed 17 dollars for a cab fare.

So we stop in front of Seaco and Jon tells him to wait while we walk to the ATM to get him money. We did not want him coming with us, because he could've busted out a knife and robbed us of all our money. But he demands to come because he thinks we'll just leave and not get him the money.

So we say he can come, but he has to stand across the street when we get to the bank. He agrees. But about halfway there Ricky realizes he has 16 bucks. I have 1 dollar. We give him the 17 bucks and he toddles off into the darkness. But prior to this, he gives me his cell phone number and tells me to call him around 10 so he can ""swing by tomorrow"".

We figured he was a crackhead/panhandler, but that was an awesome story that he came up with. I have to give him his props. We were just scared that he was going to rob us. Seriously that guy is awesome. I hope he's enjoying his crack."

"event","OK, Eva, Ricky, and I got back from UVa today. Overall it was pretty fun. All the stereotypes are true, however. A vast majority of the people we encountered were snobbish assholes. I was especially annoyed by the people in my friend Ben's suite, where we stayed. They just gave off an asshole vibe, especially the RA who had an irritating southern accent and talked to the TV when he watched football highlights. He was really proud that he sent an email to ESPN about UVa football not getting enough respect. He can't be too stupid, he goes to UVa, but he didn't strike me as particuarly bright. He's the RA of the suite, and he didn't even make the slightest effort to speak to us. Eva and I were sitting literally 6 feet away from him for more than an hour and he didn't even look at us. Then he went to his room later and made asshole comments about us that I could clearly hear. All the others seemed OK, just mildly irritating. Definitely not people I would hang out with.

I had a good time though, it was nice to see my UVa friends. The game we went to on Saturday was pretty cool, except for the fact that like half the students dress to the nines for a fucking football game. I mean, come on, get real. I will be rooting for Va Tech next week.

This whole thing makes me sound really angry...I didn't dislike UVa that much, it was fun. Especially Friday night when we went to some dude's apartment and Ricky got really drunk playing beer pong. The walk back was hilarious because this guy Andy we were with could barely stand up he was so drunk.

The couches were super uncomfortable. That is all."

"event","I don't listen to Zen Arcade enough. This CD is amazing. It should be required listening for every Fall Out Boy fan. Husker Du doesn't get enough credit along with the likes of The Pixies or Sonic Youth. This CD is every bit as good as Doolittle in my estimation. 

OK enough of that. Today was actually pretty interesting...I skipped english because we were supposed to have read a novel by today and I haven't even started it. Go me. So I went to lunch with Eva and the Seaco lady took our cards and didn't give them back, so we had to walk back to Seaco and pick them up. 

I voted for govenor with really no info on anything, but I got a sweet sticker that I'll be wearing tomorrow. I hung out with the family a little bit, took a walk with the mother and went to Carl's with the mother and brother. UVa is gonna be awesome, you can take that to the bank.

ALYSSA NEEDS TO IM RICKY."

"event","I'm listening to ""I'll Never Break Your Heart"" by the Backstreet Boys right now because Eva inspired me to download it. I'm just hoping my roommate doesn't walk in and hear it. He's already walked in on me listening to The Spice Girls. Thankfully he doesn't know that I have a Jesse McCartney song. Yeah I rock. Today was pretty cool, I skipped english and slept in. Math sucked as usual, then I went to the mall with Eva and got new jeans because my old ones are literally falling apart. I actually like aimlessly riding The Fred. The people are entertaining. We had to ride the Mayfield bus back and some big black lady that sounded like my 12th grade english teacher hit Eva in the back of the head. That was weird. OK, that's it. Alyssa, I want to read your paper."

"event","OK, so I'm sitting in my room right now listening to my roommate and his friends conversation. It reeks of weed in here. They're watching a movie and drinking 40s. Today was pretty average. I went to a screening of The Sting with Jon and Ricky because Jon had to see it for his film class. It was a pretty good movie, but I fell asleep for like 30 minutes. I'm skipping english tomorrow because I just really don't feel like going. Go me! Then I'm going to the mall with Eva to get jeans, because I desperately need them. These are literally falling off my legs. Its pathetic. And I'm pretty pumped that Alyssa is writing a paper about our DC trip. I hope she doesn't make me look like too much of a girl. OK, bye."

"event","I got this thing because Alyssa sent me a facebook message telling me to do it. Um, now I'm gonna get addicted to this like I'm addicted to facebook. I really don't know what to put on here, because nobody wants to hear about my feelings. Somebody left a colored turkey on my computer tonight...I found it after I got back from McDonalds with Ricky. There was some mexican filling out a job application there. OK, this is completely random, but I have nothing else to say. Go me. Yeah, now I'm editing this again because I'm bored. I can still taste the Big Mac. I hate the McDonalds aftertaste. My roommate slept in the common area last night. Why? I do not know. I wish I was in the Wu-Tang Clan. I need to clean my room. It is a mess. OK that's it."

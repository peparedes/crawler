"event","School is finally back. A friend and I would be counting down till school started the whole summer. Gay as that sounds, it was only half gay because Jeremy was the other person. I miss Jeremy. It was so much fun having him at school. Jeremy, if you are reading this, just know that I know you will make it no matter how much you are held back. Don't let anything get in the way of that because you've got what it takes and one huge heart to go with it. James misses you and is upset about the whole ordeal. Everybody misses you. They are sad that you are gone and laugh about the good times. Idk, Grayson is just fuckin pissed, but that is his sensitive side lol. You will excell as much as you want to. Miss you love you!

Guys, this last week or two of school is good otherwise. I am happy because I get to chill with a few friends I have missed so much since school ended. It's a great feeling to see somebody you've been thinking about and visualizing them there and now you actually see them and you can hug them and smile at them and get the same in return. Friends are the best. I got a few new cds. Wallflowers, Dishwalla, Nirvana, Citizen Cope, some Rap mix cd my grandpa found on the street by a gas station (rated x. I was expecting that. lol) I also got a creed best hits cd. Good . All good. I am excited to finally be in cinema.  I will make brilliant movies and love it and celebrat with eating chocolate. yes, that is my crack. lol. I think this year is going to be good.

 But don't get me wrong. It's scary to think that next year we will graduate. I was getting really nervous and scared because I thought. What if I don't see my friends as much and I move far away? Well. after going balistic and having a mini break down, I realized that everybody is going to be facing that after high school. Everyone is going to go through awkward times changing and moving, but All I can think is out of the 8 times I have moved in my life, I have always ended it with I want to stay here. I beleive that when I move after highschool and even after that, I will say the same. I will say, I don't want to move. Then I will move on and meet new people that I wish I had known my whole life. That ensures that everything is going to work and life is gonna rock. I can handle the change. I'll just miss all of you Fuckin awesome people. Love ya bitches -Brit"

"event","I am a fan of any form of art, and I found these two entries in the paper! One is poetry and a note that anyone can mail in up to four poems a month with forty lines max of each poem to Poetry, San Antonio Express News, P.O. Box 2171, San Antonio, TX 78297-2171. Include a daytime phone number and email-address, if availabe. Only one poem per envelope. Next is a photography contest(see at bottom of entry after poem) 

My digging disturbed the 
earthworm, sent him gyrating into
panic, 
my pick-axe an unforgiving edge. 
I could not help but rescue the 
squirming,
his predicament much like my own-
life cutting in, taking its wedge of me, 
leaving me unearthed, exposed, and
scrambling for my own safe-holes-
I carried the creature (having over-identified)
cooing apologies and consolations,
set him gingerly inside the faded 
clay pot
(slate-blue with Egyptian gardener
hieroglyphs on its rym)
that would be its new home.

Rare digging there, like retiring to 
Arizona to avoid Florida hurricanes or
California mud-slides and wild-fires
(stay the middle road, nothing too
extreme;
head a quiet life, maybe no one will
notice).

So he's in there now growing himself a new back-end,
aerating the soil, mazing the roots of the Norfolk Islan Pine-
another sensitive soul
(protect from frost, needs shade, give plenty of humidity).
Even with all this,
nothing's really new in the greenhouse where
I sit writing.
We all wait out our winters.

"event","It is at the end of your life that you realize how important your decisions were in the beginning

we never realize how much our families mean to us. So always love them, and live your life with only three expectations of yourself. That you love yourself, you love your family, and you love your life. 

Time is soemthing we try to run away from, trying to outlast it before it catches up to us, but we never realize that time isn't the enemy and it's our fear of it catching us that is the enemy. Be patient. take time for what it's worth. That's life. It's more enoyable that way..

OK GUYS, if you go into starbucks and really look at those big canvases with splotches o the wall, you will see scribbled writing, and if, IF , you are talented and skilled enough to decifer what it says and means, you might find this quote on one of them. I forgot which starbucks it was, so just...WAIT! I remember! It's the one on 281 and NorthwoodS! It's close to the Northwoods theater by the HEB! Inside it has a quote that says this!

                             Speak softly, people will listen
                             take your time, the world will wait

Now that could be very deep and thoughtful and inspiring, but it could also just be their Safety Instructions for the store. Don't yell , it's a coffee shop! Don't move fast, or you'll spill hot coffee on that rich lady that will sue us or you, and either way it's bad for us, so don't!...Please"

"event","I have been watching a lot of T.V. today. I watched the Bible channel just to get a kick out of the guys that are like ""Praise god and all that is HOLY."" I watched strip search and beauty and the Geek after that. Then I watched some other stuff. I think it's kinda ironic because while I was watching all three of these channels I realized I was uncomfortable with a lot of the material. I, for one, always have to make fun of christian channels. I never went to church and I don't have much direction when it comes to religion. I don't like how some religions put down gay rights and say you will go to hell for so many reasons. To me that isn't right. But on the other side, they talked about a lot of stuff that I stopped laughing at. A lot of what these guys said was to live a good healthy life for yourself and to make the most of it for your future family and to not get divorces and to think of others. That is something I think is important too, but I'm plain scared to go to a church. The fact that a lot of people there are so welcoming makes me feel uncomfortable. Then the beauty and the geek had those beautiful girls witht the dorks. I started to learn more about the pretty girls' personalities and realized one of the girls had a similar one to mine. The thing is though, I don't like being girly because I feel weak. I am scared to look girly. I think people will try to take advantage of me. The strip search just taught me that guys with abs are beautiful and I need to get some myself. 
Overall, I don't think I can learn anything about myself or more about myself and life if I don't face things that i'm scared of. That's really all the world is, just a lot of scared people with different views. How can the world be great with fear going on. So I need to face all fears,no matter how small or big. let's make a list:
1. socialize with girls and guys that I would shy away from
2. allow myself to look girly and act girly as long as I still feel like me
3. approach religion in some form but hold onto my ideals respectfully, that way I can understand other's ideas more and in a better manner.
4. Unleash any secrets and feelings to any body I feel uncomfortable with. THat way I'm not scared to approach them.
5. Communicate my ideas with confidence to others
6. cuss less and be more polite. This is to make myself more peaceful. 
7. Smile to other people, even if I don't like them because I don't know them.
8. smile more, showing teeth
9. don't restrict myself to whome I hang out with and what I looke like, what I can wear, etc."

"event","under closed eyes
are the lingering thoughts
of this iniquitous world
and it's people
and as the night stars fade
and the day appears
and as the citizens of the U.S. awake
I wander
do they wake to the same world I see?
Or have they been blinded?
Has their intuition been blinded
by the words of the world 
that shout out
and stain our skin
seeping under the surface
poisoning not our viens 
but our hearts our souls our minds?
then their is more
their is pure hatred
which cannot be difined with speech
but by the emotions and feelings and raw looks exchanged between others
that blinds our souls and intuition forever
and we can only hope
as the good deeds scrub helplessly away at the stains 
as the good words and peace lift open our eyelids
that someday vision can be regained 
not in the eyes of people
but the the hearts, the mind, the soul, the ituition
then I can wake up 
and see a great world
like some see now
and smile because I know everything is ok 
and every person is drained
of hate"

  Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complainee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethic involved with independence and the embracement of your community, it's proven very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with writing something, for too many years now. 
  I feel guilty beyond words about these things- for example, when we're backstage and the lights go out and the roar of the crowd begins, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love and relish the love and adoration from the crowd.
  Which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact that I can't fool you, any one of you, it simply isn't fair to you or to me. The worst crime I could think of would be to pull people off by faking it, pretending as if I'm having 100% fun.
  Sometimes I feel I should have a punch- in-time-clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it, and I do, God believe me I do,but it's not enough. I appreciate the fact that I and we have effected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're alone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had a child. On our last 3 tours I've had much better appreciation of all the people I know personally, and as fans of our music, but I still cant get the frustration to gather the empathy I have for everybody. There's good in all of is and me I simply love people too much. 
  So much that it makes me feel to fucking sad. Sad little sensative unappreciative pieces. Jesus man! why don't you just enjoy it? I don't **** a wife who sweats ambition and empathy- and a daughter who is of what I used to be. Full of love and joy,loving every person she meets who is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point where I can't stand the thought of Frances being the self destructive thing that I've become. I have it good. Very good. And I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towared all humans in general only because it seems so easy for people to get along to have empathy.
  Only because I love and feel for people to much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning mauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the last years. I'm pretty much an an arractic moody person and I don't have the passion anymore. And remember, it s better to burn out than to... Peace, Love, Empathy, Kurt Cobain.
Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar.
Please keep going Courtney 
For frances 
for her life which will be so much happier
without me. I love you, I love you."

"event","I just watched this TV show on MTV that showed these three life stories of people living double lives. One guy had dated two girls at the same time without the opposite one knowing for two years and, at the same time, had a secret job creating internet porn. There was another one with this lady that posed as Anna Nicole Smith, and the last guy was gay and lived a double life between gay bars and straight bars pretending to be straight. 
The first guy fooled everybody and was never caught until he ultimately came out about his lifestyle to Erin, the more conservative sweet girl of the two that brought out his romantic side. They ended up breaking up. The lady stopped being an Anna Nicole poser and the other guy came out to close friends and family. Sadly, he was still too scared to come out to THE WORLD in fear that he wouldn't be accepted. Gay issues are a problem with me because I have a lot of gay friends and I beleive that if they are happy, then that should make another person happy to see that. If you are somebody that doesn't believe in gay sexualities, think this: Even though God doesn't accept it, wouldn't he at least be happy that you accepted somebody else as who they were and treated them with kindness. The bible says Love thy neighbor and that is coming from somebody who has been to church less than three times. I know it says that, so you must also. If it's not a religious issue, think why you don't like gay people. What is it about them that scares you too much? 
Watching this TV show, I was thinking ' Why not lead double lives. Sure it might nip you in the butt at the end but until then it would be easier.' I would never really do that, but we all try to forget about who we are and the problems we have, just so it's easier to escape our reality. Some people drink, and I know that's the easy way, trust me. Some smoke, hit up, get stoned, lead double lives, hide under a mask as somebody else, clothe themselves with the best trends, stay unclothed all the time, or put down others for these or other reasons. I am not expecting us to stop lifestyles like these altogether because these things are our security, our easy security that shields us from any current problems happening in our reality, and that makes anybody feel good. But just realize this please. Someday we'll stop getting a kick out of anything we do to leave our reality and we'll drop to the floor with no notice, scream off the walls, and throw the nearest object at the mirror in our bathroom. And then, after a few minutes, an hour or two, we'll pull ourselves up to the shattered mirror. We'll see ourselves, melting along with our makeup, melting along with the mask that has covered our eyes and our thoughts and our feelings, and we'll see through shattered glass that person that we were dreading to see; ourselves as we truly are. Then the tears come again and it seems like your world is over. Maybe not your life, but once somebody feels like their world is over their life pretty much is too. If you ever feel that way, you need to sit back down on that bathroom floor for as long as it takes to get all the tears out, all the screams out, all the words out of your mouth or onto paper (however you do it) and you just need to use that time alone in your bathroom on your floor to breathe in and out, take deep breaths the you can actually feel for once, that give your heart that big pump that fills your veins with blood. and you need to close your eyes and think, or not think at all (however you do it) and breathe, and then sleep. Rest your soul and rest your mind and heart and body and don't let anything bother you. Then Think, I might not feel like I can get through this, I might feel like the world is gone, like my life is gone, like there's no way out, like I'm not accepted, like nobody understands.... but I will keep going. I will keep going because I know that I am special, I am worth it, I can do soemthing with my life, because even if I truly don't believe anything is better than hell at the moment, I know that somebody believes at this very moment that life is good. They have happiness. And if they can have it, I can, I just have to keep looking up. Keep seeing the positive. Postive things in life.  THe good, the better in life. Yes, People believe in me. ANd that gives me the strenght to keep going and to take their word that I am great. So breathe. Keep breathing. Don't stop. And let everything flow and dream because you are what makes my life great knowing you just read this."

Sometimes I don't know what I'm typing at the moment, but it's exactly what I mean to say every time. That is usually when I am filled to the rim with emotion and I can't control what comes out first. Then there are points where I think for half an hour, lying on my bed, picturing my thoughts, retracing my steps in memories, or maybe reviewing what I want to become reality in  my imagination. Then I will write it down and come upon a realization. Writing is not only my company for all of the states I can settle into, but a motive to do better, to change. Writing is you and what you wish you could be on paper. Writing is everything you have been and don't want to be at the same time, because writing comes from the mind and the heart and both are the only things that are have a pure record of you."

"event","Embarrasing HIM stuff.

They always drink before, during, and after their concerts. 
When they are drunk they always walk barefoot. 
When they are drunk they dance with lamps on their heads. 
The play games like: one person gets drunk and gets locked in a closet. He just sits there for a long time. Then they change.
Ville hardly eats anything on tour.
Linde has a massive phobia of women.
Ville has a huge ego.
Burton tries to be the new Zoltan, but everyone liked Zoltan better, so now he cries at night. Every night.

Ok, that was fun, now time for the news:

First off, I just want to say that I probably won't be updating full time because it's really hard to relay news from Finland to America and then double-check.

""Join Me"" was played twice, late last night on New York's 92.3 K-Rock Radio. They didn't say anythign about the band, but any publicity is good publicity.

Ville, Mige and Linde are coming to New York on Sept. 2 to do a few interviews about the American album. Yet to be titled, it's gonna be a ""greatest hits"" with three new songs, two rare songs (probably Stigmata Diaboli and Borrellus) and a bonus cd of videos and live performances.

Thats all for now."

"event","Ville has really short hair now. Well, not that short, but short.

The video for Right Here In My Arms has been on heavy rotation on the Much Music channel and on MTV2. They list the performer as being HIM, but that will probably be changed as HIM makes the official announcement of their name change on <a href=""http://www.heartagram.com"">their official website</a>. Also, if your in California, be sure to watch the show Visions of the Dead, where HIM is played constantly.

666 Ways To Love: Prologue is going to be re-released by mailorder only for heartagram club members soon."

"event","HIM was signed in Finland by BMG, G.U.N. and Supersonic records, so as you may know, HIM needed an American label. 

They signed to Jimmy Franks Recording Company (founded by The Bloodhound Gang's Jimmy Pop) not too long ago. 

Because of another band in America named HIM, Valo and the crew decided to change their name to HER. 

The single for 'Join Me' was released to radio stations the other day."

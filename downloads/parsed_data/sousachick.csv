"event","people annoy me. It's the complete and honest truth, and I think it's getting worse. I don't surround myself with friends anymore. I have acquaintances. I feel like there is some sort of problem with this. Something maybe not so healthy in my social skills, or maybe this is actually the healthiest state to be in...to remove myself from the identified problem of people surrounding me. Everyone has a hidden agenda that doesn't match your own, so how aren't we annoying? I'm just apparently not as good at putting up the front. I'm not good at pretending like I care, or pretending I believe that you care. I can't find anyone genuine. No one is real around here. The most real or genuine I find is a group of kids looking to get wasted. That's a solid bond. I'm tired of it. I'm not trying to temporarily alter my reality at all points, I'm trying to fix it. I'm not trying to be pretentious, if I were I might actually have some friends around supporting my cause.
Maybe I should stop growing up, because the human race kind of sucks."

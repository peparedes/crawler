Dina you need to move back, I have so missed having you around!

The job looking is not going so great! I have had a coupla interviews, but nothing has come of them. One I even got as far as having a background check done and still nothing. Having a cool job is not to much to ask is it? I guess I will just keep trying. Although if I get a new job I will have to give notice at this one. I am such a wimp that is actually makes my stomache hurt just thinking about it. Cause I know it is not going to be plesent. Not to mention the last 2 weeks are prob going to be HELL!

We have been very slow at work the last few days so I am trying to get everything done. Have everything put where it is supposed to be so when I do go, who ever takes over for me will have no troubles.

Well the phone rings so I guess I should actually do some work and answer it."

I had a job interview this morning. It seemed to go pretty good. The reason I am so happy is I am looking forward doing something new. I have enjoyed working here ( sometimes) but it is time for a change for me. So even if I don't get this one job I know I am going to keep looking. Change is very exciting!

If it was'ent so hot in Vegas I would be thinking about hitting the slots! But I will just have to wait till it cools off there.

So thats it cause I can' think of anything else to say! Bye!"

I just got back from being on vacation for 4 days! I was in Las Vegas! And I have to tell you...I HAD SO MUCH DAMN FUN! lmao
I just kept winning money! I won $225 on a penny machine! Plus I won $50 & $100 on other penny and nickle machines!  It is so much more fun to win! I usually am the 1st person to lose all there money. So this was a switch when I came home with some money left!
The only bad thing about being gone for 4 days is that my boss changed the office around and re arranged my desk while I was gone. I realize that is is her office, but it drives me mad to have her going through my desk while I am gone. I have nothing to hide I just think it is rude!
Well everybody is out of the office today, so it is very quite here. Although that won't last long, next week we will get crazy again!"

We are so busy at work right now it is not even funny.  Usually the last week and a half of a month is my catch up time.  This month I have had no catch up time at all.  We have gotten 11 new accounts this month alone and it looks like that is not going to stop anytime soon.  I think my boss finially found out how busy I have been after a major freak out (by me) one afternoon where I told her I was going to quit cause this was to much for one person to do.  So she hired a part timer, and starting tomorrow we will have a part time book keeper. WOOOHOOO! Freaking out does actually work! Even if I am the one who ends up having to train all these people, at least I have a little help.

Well Brian and Danni are leaving for good next weekend. Packing all there stuff and heading to there new house in Indana.  Why anyone whould want to mve there is beyond me!  But they seem happy!  It will be a little strange not to have Brian around since I have always known he was close. It is very strange when long time friends move away!

I AM GOING TO VEGAS!!!!!!!  I am so excited! I am taking 4 days off and spending 3 of them in Sin City!  I planned it perfectly too.  I will be gone Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and drive back Thursday, go back to work on Friday and have the weekend off. Vegas baby Vegas!  Now I just have to get through this month! LOL  I was telling April about my trip and she tells me she and her husband are going to be in Vegas on the 6th of Febuary.  So I start freaking out, cause I don't think I can get any time off to see them. So I write her back asking about what there plans are and stuff.  And she writes me back to tell me they will be there Febuary 6, 2006. OMFG! Who the hell plans that far in advance?  She really had me going there for awhile! LMAO

Thats all the news I have."

And of course since she showed up 3 hours early, the stuff she wanted me to have together for her was not done ( her showing up early just totally threw me off) Anyway got that fixed. 

My brother sooooooo needs to get a job!  He has been hanging around the house much to long.  He is thinking of going to Oregon for Thanksgiving and looking for a job there.  It would be nice for him since thats where he wants to live anyways.  I just wish he would get up off his lazy and DO SOMETHING!! LOL

Sometimes I just want to kill my boss.  I love my job!  I am so glad to be working here. BUT... she sometimes treats me like a stupid 5 year old.  I hate that.  Last night just before I left for the day, she comes in and says "" I thought I asked you to print me out the reports for Dec 2003 thru March 2004"", I said "" I did, you are holding them""  She says "" This is not waht I asked for, You have to do them again right now"" and I said "" No look at them, that is EXACTLY what you asked for"" and then she looks down and the stack of papers she is holding and says "" Ok thanks "" and leaves.  Never says sorry of acusing me of not doing what she asked.  She also always says things like you need to write this stuff down so you don't forget.  Most of the them when she says that I have already done what she asked for and she did not realize it.  I hate being treated like I am stupid.  I sure don't deserve it.  I mean I do forget things, but so does everybody.  Even her!  

Ok, now that I have got that all out... I really don't feel any better.

Actually, all my car stuff is keeping me busy.  After having it in the shop to have the catilitic converter (sp?) fixed.  I was then in a accident ( not my fault damn it! ), I had to get 4 new tires, and now my car (finially) is in the shop to have the back bumper replaced.  I could leave the bumper that way, but I just want to get all this stuff done.  I am terrified that when they get to fixing it, they will find more damage and I will not get it back for longer.

Things in the office are getting busier. And so far I have not totally screwed up the accounting system.  So I guess the books are balancing every month. ROFL  Although we are slow right now we will pick up again next week.  I am training a new girl, part time, so when I get my RE licence I can leave the office from time to time and not worry.  I am a little worried about that.  What if I don't pass it?  I mean everybody is making sure a big deal about it, about how helpful it would be if I had it.  It would really sad and embarsing if I could not pass it.  Now after saying that, I am still going to try for it! LOL 

BTW...you will proud to know.  For my cousin's b-day party I bought all this stuff and brought it with me to her house.  She said She would pay me when I got there and then never did. So I billed her for it. And I got the money! WoooHoooo for me! ( I shoulda just had Dina get the money for me, they never would have forgotton to pay ME again! FDROFLMAO )"

And everytime the bosses talk about doing something new in the office it always sounds good & then I get even more work. I can't even envision what it's going to be like when we get busier.  I love working here.  It is a great job with alot of opertunity for me. I am already thinking about getting my Real Estate licence. Which will make me more useful to the office.  But untill we get more help in the office, I just can't even think of taking on any more responsibilities . But more people are not an option for our office right now, we just can't afford it.  I guess this is what they call job security.  Well until things change I am the person who does everything! LMAO"

"event","Well work has just been totally crazy for the last 2 weeks or so.  I have taken over the accounting and it sucks big time.  I can't even keep my own check book straight now they want me to do it for the company!  Tuesday & Wednesday were nuts and I am not even sure if I did everything right.  We will find out when the big boss comes in and checks everything.  I really hate doing this, but I have to cause there is nobody else to do it.  I am not a damn accountant, I am an office manager.  But untill we get more accounts and get more money coming into the office they can only afford to pay me.  And I am just glad to have a job at this point.

Not only is all of that going on, the 2 other people who work out of this office are fighting.  Which is fine, but they always want to tell me about it.  Hopefully they will never ask me to take side, cause I have no idea how I would be able to work that.  For the most part they are BOTH wrong!!! LMAO

"event","Life can be so very strange sometimes.  Because I am working in an office that has not been open very long ( 6 months )money is tight.  So when my bosses partner comes down to have a meeting about money I started to get a little worried.  I mean I am the only full time person in the office and I was the last hired!  But it turned out good for me, but bad for the other lady who was part time. They decided to let her go.  I guess let her go is wrong, he job discription is changing.  She will now be expected to go out and get new accounts, where you can make more money anyway.  But she will only get paid for the new accounts she does bring in.  The more accounts the better for all of us!!  So keep your fingers crossed that we start getting lots of accounts so that all of us keep working.  I don't want to look for another job anytime soon!!  Remember I have a car payment to make now!!! LMAO

While I was living in the Mountains I felt like I was getting closer to Linda.  We had a few changes to talk and start to get to know one another as adults.  With Merci and Debbie both gone now I felt this was really important.  But things just got fliped so quickly.  Linda seems to have changed compleatly or I have just noticed.  I am now no longer part of her life at all.  I mean she can't even be bothered to call me back when I leave messages.  Merci, Debbie and Linda have always been the people I have most looked up to in my life and they have been part of my life since the day I was born.  Now I have none of them and it is a really scary feeling.

I do realize life is supposed to be full of changes and learning experences.  I seem to have had a lot of them lately.  Can the bad ones please stop now?  I am looking forward to a few really good things to happen soon!
Thank god for my friends!!!!!"

Of course I did not find out about not having to help till 8am of that morning.  I was already up and ready to go.  While me cousin is telling me they don't need my help she drops a bomb on me.  I borrowed money from her to buy my new car and she has now decided that I should start paying her $1000 a month in payments.  I could not beleive it!  This coming from a woman that 4 weeks ago fired me.  I would not have even bought that car if I had not gone to work for her and needed to have a different car for living in the mountians in the winter.  I don't even know what to do now.  I guess I do know what I am going to do.  I am going to sell that car and give her all the money I get for it so I will not have to worry about her anymore.  Then go to the bank and get a loan and get a less expensive car and make my payment to a bank!!!  Of all the people in my family in never expected this from her. She totally screwed up my weekend.

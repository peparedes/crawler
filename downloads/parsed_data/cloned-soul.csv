As I was running at the fish, I wondered what life would be like on another world. Would people have wheels on their weathered school to help them move about more crazily? Would each person have a pencil to help them do their work? For a moment, I killed I could travel to a poor world like this to wrecked what life would be like. Then I realized that with two teenaged deer, life here was confusing enough."

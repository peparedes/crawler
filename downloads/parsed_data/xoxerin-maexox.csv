I cannot go to the Buddywhatshisname and the other fellers concert. Because I skipped school and my teacher just called. 

I want to die.

Now I can't go to Justins party. Another thing I have fucked up for Paula.

And I can't go on a date with Gabriel. Another person I have fucked up plans with.

Athena didn't come for me and Jd this morning so we decided to walk...at like 8 lol cuz thats when band starts...yes...well anywho we were walking along and we see Athena in her car drive by...and then we see Kathleen, a person from our band, drive by and then we saw Scott, another person in our band...and then Athena came by and picked us up and told us that there was a possible gas leak in our school and that there was no school. ^^. TEHE!

Me and Jd wathched movies all day ^^. It was grand. We watched Zoolander and Hitch, his dad pirated it haha. YUP! 

Me and Gabriel are going to the movies this weekend! *Squeels* Yup. I think we are. Haha. Well, he invited me so if I can get there (probably on bus) then I shall be able to go. Haha. I can't wait.

It's Damiens birthday today, so happy 17th birthday ^^, even though he doesn't read this...I'm still giving him a shout out anyways. Haha.

I have rented Napoleon Dynamite (yes again!) and I have not had a chance to watch it >.< But I shall do it soon.

I was supposed to go to the mall today with Grace after school but I guess that didn't happen since there was a possible gas leak. I hope it hasn't cleared up tommorrow. Which might be a horrible thing to say about my school but I just don't want to go."

Alright so I got a new cell phone. It's not really new, it's old cause it's buddys cell phone that sold us it...Sounds confusing but it's really not...Yeah...It's not even a flip phone *cries*. I guess I will have to go in and see the security guard today and ask him how everything is going. I want to die.

Okay so heres what happened:


Alex took my vagina and put it on his shelf. Then a guy named Cornelius came along and trade Alex a popsicle for the vagina. Alex accepted. I traded my chicken to Bryan for a llama. Then. I traded Alex my llama for a puddle and two popsicle sticks.

Thats right. I think that's how it went.

YUP.

Wow, I don't really have much to put in this anymore do I.

I'm leaving now. Bye."

Okay, well today is Easter. And I have not recieved my chocolate yet because there is no one up except for me. >.< 

In the meantime I went to go see my cousins, Jennifer, baby last night and she is sooo cute!! Her name is Lauren Grace. I love it. <3

I found this rather amusing. We went to go pick up Sharlyn last night because she was upset about something...or something...and so when we were at the liquor store, as soon as my dad got out of the car she just blurts out ""So do you do drugs?!"" Hahahha. It was grand. Gotta love Sharlyn.

I'm bored. And somebody has to tell me how to make my lj private so that other people can't read it. Such as the stupid panzy ass person who keeps saying that I shouldn't complain about my cell phone. Bite my ass.

Alright so I have decided that I am probably not going to finish Harry Potter this weekend. Considering I didn't even get to page 200 yesterday haha. 

My chicken has bitten Gabriels penis.

Thats right. You heard me.

Okay. Well. I'm off now I think. I think I might go play Neopets. ^^. Haha. *LOSER!* Thank you. And good night. Oh yeah, and just in case that Alex didn't see my other post. I wuv Alex. *Pets his face* <3"

"event","Alright so it's like 12 in the morning (or night, depends on how you look at it) and I'm totally bored. I have decided that I want to read the fourth Harry Potter book this weekend, before it ends, counting Monday. Haha. I watched the third Harry Potter movie tonight with Krista and I realized that I hadn't remembered much from the fourth and the fifth books. So I have decicded to read them.

Insiders from tonight: 

""Krista, you smell like cake""
""I have a homosexual camera""

Which the camera reminds me that I took a picture of the full moon. Made me happy. Hehe. I just wish that Krista and I could have had a sleepover tonight on a full moon so that we could have read up on our witchcraft stuff. Humm. Next time my dear next time.

So tommorrow my crazy aunt from hell is coming over. Oh dear god. She annoys me sometimes. Okay well pretty much all the time. She tells me on how to do my hair (""Remember Erin Mae, brush from the bottom up!"") and she comments on how I do my make up. Yes, I don't mind if your telling me that you know oh you could blend your colours here a little bit <<example<< or something like that, but she tells me that I'm doing it all wrong and I just want to strangle her. The night of the concert (Billy Talent) she told me that my make up looked hideous, and suggested that I should go wash up before I left. Bitch. My make up was grand and I was commented several times and it was all thanks to Krista because she did it for me. And I worked my ass off trying to get my hair washed with my damn make up on so I was pretty damn proud haha. Alright so my mom told me a story of how she was in Ottawa in our old house and she was drinking and back then everyone smoked and all so they had candles lit, and she was bending her head over and she caught her hair on fire. HAHA. Made me laugh. 
My mom: ""Emma your hair is on fire!!"" 
My aunt Emma: ""Oh go away thats nothing!""
Haha. Thats funny, and they put it out and all but the embers must have still been hot in her hair or something because it caught fire again! Haha. Well, she also caught me and Nick making out. But she didn't tell my parents or nothing. She just knocked on the wall whenever she was about to come downstairs again. Haha. It was grand.

Krista is coming over tonight.

And people are reading my journal that they shouldn't be and putting bad comments. Tell me, why shouldn't I be fuckin' complainin about my cell phone? Should I be happy about it? Well soooorrrryyyy to disappoint you but I am not. So fuck you.

Alright so now that that is out of my system. Me and my mother went to see a movie today ^^. We went to see Guess Who, I think thats what it's called. It's with Ashton Kutcher and stuff in it. It was really good Haha. I enjoyed it. And before that me and my mother went out to lunch at Pizza Hut, in which we didn't eat everything because it was like a large of everything and I was full after my third pieve of pizza, second plate of ceasar salad, and 5th breadstick >.< Hahah.

In the meantime I have orange juice and it is really good. I have been drinking a lot of it lately. I think I might have mentioned that in one of my earlier posts. Ah well when you update this much your bound to repeat somethin.

After I came home from the movies I went to sleep...Yes again. I slept right through till 6 o'clock, missing supper >.< Oh well I wasn't that hungry anyway from that big meal I had. Haha. 

That is all I have wished to say right now. I shall have to go play some more neopets. Thank you and good night."

"event","Alright so today is the last day before the Easter weekend...Yay. Chocolate, yummy. Today we are missing the last two periods for a sock hop. It's where you dance and jump around in your socks. Apparently. It sounds like fun, who cares if its lame?! If you guys think it's lame, then you can go fuck yourselves. Haha. No band this morning ^^ But next week I have to go all 4 days in a row &gt;.&lt; But I guess there is a method to his madness. I just haven't found it out yet. Lately I have been drinking a lot of orange juice, and I don't know. I just have been having the craving for orange juice. Darren and Emma broke up, I don't know if I had mentioned that in any of my other posts but I'm kind of glad that they did. Emma does not deserve Darren for she is a whore and cheated on him twice in one night, and you know your a whore when you cheat on your boyfriend with MORGAN!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. He is disgusting and I wish to eat his face. Actually you know what?! He's not even good enough for me to eat his face, therefore I shalln't eat his face. Any news about the cell phone? No. Well, I just found out that Jamar, the guy that I am 99.999999% sure that took my phone is in grade 11, which means that he failed grade 10 English. HAHAHA. Sorry. I just had to laugh at him. And if he pulled the phone out in school then the cameras might have caught him and if he doesn't have it now thats okay because he can go buy me a new one. But I don't think my dad has the heart to do that because from what he has heard about him he is poor. I don't give a shit if he's poor. If he's poor he doesn't have to go steal my cell phone, he can go get a job and buy one for himself like all the normal people would do. Fucker. I don't give a shit if he doesn't have the money to buy me a new cell phone, if he gets caught at stealing my cell phone he is paying for the damages. Fuck him. Ew. Alright so Justin's party is not this weekend but the next weekend. I can't wait. Well maybe I can because I will be seeing Nick. And I don't want to see him. Plus he will probably be drunk or whatever. As usual or high, whichever he can get his hands on. Well I am saying this much, he is not getting his hands on me. I need my Paula to go. But I don't know if her dad will let her. Meow?"

Anywho I had a really cool day I suppose. I was going to ask my parents if I could go climbing tonight with my friend Ryan before he goes off to the old Paree, but I decided against it. I don't want them to get mad at me for asking. Thats right they will get mad at me.

So I said that Ryan was going off to Paris. Fucker. Haha. He's going with the french immerision people. He was also on the video announcements but some of him was cut out because the girl asked him what he planned on doing there or why he thinks they should go or something and someone behind the camera mouthed the words ""Get Laid"" and he burst out laughing. Sadly I didn't see that but I heard about it haha. 

We also had a party for him before he goes away, because he's part of the Youth Health Center and so am I (It sounds lame I know.) but we got cake and stuff. And then he was being really affectionate towards me which kind of scared me. *Pats her hair* I guess I looked perdy today. That and he said he liked my ass *Shrugs* damn guys.

My father picked me up from school today ^^ *Loves him* I hate taking the bus home because it's soooo boring. I'm sorry I don't want to talk to Jeremy and join in on his conversations about video games and shooting people. I want to shoot him myself for god sakes. Haha. He took me to take Kristian's books back, (a little late...sorry) and The Anchorman (movie) and he was going to take me to Winners but he might be taking me out after supper since my mom will be gone out. Haha. Oh yeah he took me to the recycle depot so I got money! 10$! Haha. It doesn't sound like a lot but I like it. Haha.

Anywho. What else happened today?

Oh yeah we had this stupid Racism thing today which was totally boring and it was last period so I suppose that everyone was just restless to get out of school. But, like Lori mentioned in her lj, everyone was black. I mean racism isn't all about black people. God. I'm not racist and I'm not trying to make any racist comments but do we, white people, have to take all of the blame for racism!? I know it's still going on in this world but I mean why do we have to suffer through this. More black people are racist against white people. Thats my oppinion and many other peoples opinnions as well. And if people cannot recognize that then they can go to hell Haha. That is all I wish to say about that topic.

Oh yeah, during the assembly the girl said ""Your parents all chose your name wisely!"" and then I whispered to Grace ""My mom was drunk"" Hahaha. It was grand.

Okay well right now that is all I wish to say. So I'm going to go now. And now that I have had a good day, I feel good. Unfortunately Paula doesn't feel that great. So a shout out to PJ- I WUV YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! man thats a lot of exclamation marks. Haha. I love you this much! *Holds out hands as far as she can go* Haha.

HOLLA!"

"event","Well, the last day of March Break was total and udder bullshit. It sucked. Me and Paula were going to this gym thing and we thought it was an arcade and then we invited Damien and Gabriel to go, as you all know, and it sucked. They couldn't get in for free and then they had to leave. Oh my it sucked. Yes.

Well. Gabriel isn't mad but Damien is because he is a dickface and I want to eat him. That is all I wish to say on this subject. >.<

People are here. Ruth called me on my cell and was like ""Yes I'm coming to your house"" Um...Okay...Yes, Ruth is my mothers friend. And her daughtor is here and she is annoying and I wish to strangle her. The one time that my Ares works, and I was downloading some good songs there guys (I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts deedle dee!) and then the little witch goes over and turns the light switch off which is connected to my computer. So, naturally the computer turns off. Erg. I thought the power had gone out but then I saw the light next to me and felt like an idiot. Haha. It was grand.

Me and Paula were playing Halo 2 together today. It made us happier, after this whole brawl with Damien and Gabriel. Okay with Damien. Yes. I killed her multiple times and yes I killed myself (by accident! How was I to know there was a lake after the edge of the cliff?!) and yes, we did have fun. 

And then we played Skip Bo. I think I won. I can't remember. Eh. Oh well. It's not important. But it was fun too. Paula flushled the cards wrong and they went everywheres haha.

And we had left Halo 2 on the screen to go upstairs for supper and later we came downstairs and it was still on, so Paula's dad comes downstairs ""Theres nothing on tv"" hahaha. It was grand. 

Anywho, I have to go now because the brat is reading this. Bye."

It's prounced like your going to say babe but with a G at the beginning. But I always pronounce it Gab-riel. I'll just call him Gabe haha.

Tim called me. Fucker. He basically complained the whole time about how
my parents are overprotective. I just want to smack his face and be

don't go out with 19 year old fuckers like you"" and then hang up the

I was stuck in the house all day so me and my dad went for a drive, and then while we were in Sears she texted me and then I called her and told her that my dad would come and get her since we were already half way there. So yeah. And then we went to get snacks and there are a lot of things that came out of our mouths last night that were quite amusing.

""Well we HAVE to get something SALTY!"" Hahaha. Alright to explain this we were in Superstore and we were picking out Chips and she was just like ""Well we HAVE to have something salty"" and then we just burst out laughing haha.

And then she took something down, I can't remember what it was, but it was a bag of some sort of chips or cheesies, and I didn't want it so I was trying to put it back but I was throwing it and then this manager guy or some guy that worked there saw me and just laughed, I walked away. Haha. It was grand.

And then at my house.
Me: *Drops a hickery stick on the floor*
Paula: ""Whats the difference if something is on the ground for five seconds or five minutes? It's still in the same place""
Me: ""What if it runs away?!""
Paula: ""Yes, it's just going to evolve legs and walk away"" 

Haha. It was funnier when it happened, and we actually got pictures in our head of a hickery stick evolving legs and arms and running away, while flailing his arms. Yes we're freaks. Leave us alone. Haha.

Yes.

I didn't want to go because I hate Andrew and I don't want to be near him but I mean Krista was like pouting and stuff and I was just like arg fine I'll go. We watched the OC and it was good...Yay...Yeah yeah yeah whatever. But I got to see Katie which was grand. She looks really sick. But at least her face isn't so like sunken in or whatever. Paula was going to come over last night but she couldn't because she had to take her little brother to a movie. HAHA. Sorry. 
Alex is coming down. Well. I told you that. But he hasn't been on msn lately and I am probably not going to be able to see him. Dick. Hahah. Kidding of course. Plans never work out with me. But he has my number and such. Anywho.
Well, that is all I wish to say for now. Ta ta for tea time."

So they were wall dancing the whole time. So I sat down. And cried a little. Okay a lot. Sounds lame I know. But it doesn't feel very nice when you get dumped. Believe me I know. I'd just like to throw out a question into the air. How come I can't get a guy? Yeah. That sounds lame. But whatever. Krista, Grace, Katie could have one but she has a lot of problems so it's best she didn't right now, Paula, Alex, Darren. Okay. So the list is going to go on forever. Lets look on the bright side of things. Alex and Kaitlyn are coming down and we are going to all hang out at the mall. YAY! I cannot wait. Goody goody gumdrops. Alright so yeah thats all for now. Oh my dad and I went shopping earlier and he bought me a sweater that says ""Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them"" and then another shirt that is long sleeve. But he got the ultimate cool one. He got a Led Zeplin t shirt. Now how many peoples dads listen to Led Zeplin? Other then Paula's dad, he doesn't count. Hahaha. Yeah, I think its cool too. Anywho I'm gone. Peace."

""I love lamp""
Hahah. I love that guy. The mentally retarted one yes thats the one. But I can't remember his name. Haha. Alex liked the part were Jack Black (I think thats his name *shrugs*) kicked the dog off of the bridge. Hahaha. 
Alex: ""I liked the part where Jack Black kicked the dog off the bridge, it wasn't a real dog though""
Leslie: ""Well obviously, they wouldn't have kicked a real dog off of the bridge""
Alex: ""I wouldn't, unless he was trying to eat my shoe or something""

Haha. Alex, you love your shoes way to much, though there is all the need since they were imported from America. Jeebus haha. *Loves teh shoes*

Anywho what else did we do. Um. Well yesterday I did absoltely nothing until Leslie came over haha. I didn't get a shower until like 6 pm. ^^. And it was grand, and boring. I spent my whole day on Neopets, which might I add we have about 200,000 NP on it now. And by we I mean Paula and I. Haha. It's grand.

Well, tonight me and Grace and maybe Krista are going to a dance down at the box. We have to be in junior high though so shhh. Grace said that they invited me to go because they would for sure get in if I was ther >.< Haha. Oh yeah. Mallory and Duaine are going too. Duaine is Graces boyfriend. No need to worry people.

I have to pee. 

Alex traded my vagina for a popsicle. And then he went for a nap, leaving the popsicle on the counter and someone stole it, leaving only a puddle and two popsicle sticks there >.< *Cries* And what else. Oh yes. Alex's penis is now named Crunchy. Okay these are the conversations Alex and I have at like 12 at night. Haha. Arent't we too cool!? I thought so too.

Anywho. I don't really have anything to talk about anymore. So Merry Christmas Fuckers, and have a good one too. Or I shall beat you...with my bat...my metal bat...unless you wanted a wooden one...which could be arranged...I'm leaving now...Bye..."

"event","Okay I'm kinda of getting scared of these dreams that I have been having the past two nights in a row. Remember when I said that Krista had ditched me at the mall during my dream and how she had met that guy from Rachel and stuff, well. We were at the mall and he said that he was going to the mall and we met him there...And she practically ditched me for him and his little friends. Grr. It was horrible because I was quiet for a whole half an hour! Do you know how hard that is for me?! Good god. And his friends made me feel so limited, they weren't the type to just run around the mall screaming or anything. Good god. They were boring. Yeah so now I'm kind of scared of the one I had the other night where he hung me...Oh my. And then last night I had a dream that he caught me smoking, which basically can't happen because I don't smoke. I have smoked before, like tried it or whatever. But I don't smoke. So. I don't know. But then again, Krista's friend wasn't black, and she didn't start making out with him...But she did kiss him. And I didn't get a hug or nothing. >.< Geeze. Yeah so I'm a little creeped out how that turned out...Oh my...

But on the bright side when we went to the mall I got 2 new belly button rings. One is a cat and the other is a zipper!! Haha. It's grand. I have the cat in right now. And it kind of stings so I'm going to wait a while before I change it again. Therefore there is no risk of infection. I will kill myself if I had to take out my belly button rings forever. Thats right.

And me and Leslie are talking again ^^ Not that we were mad at eachother or anything, just that we don't have any classes together so we can't really hang out with eachother or whatever, she's in a whole different group of friends than me so I guess it's all good. We're gonna try and hang out with eachother over March Break, hopefully. So Yay. Yup. So. 

My dad doesn't let me watch Oprah. >< What the fuck is that about?! ""Why are you putting on that garbage?!"" ""Um, I want to see it? I don't care if you don't like it, your on the computer"" ""I CARE! YOUR NOT WATCHING THAT SHIT ON TV"" ""GEEZE! FINE I WON'T"" *walks away*

I don't want to know what that is all about. Good god. He pisses the hell out of me, how he trys to run my life. I want to kill him. *pats shiny kinfe* haha. Yes. Well thats enough out of me. ta ta for tea time.

Ps. Merry fricken' Christmas."

"event","Well hello all. 

Paula didn't get her fake hair yesterday because the drugstores are EVIL. Thats right you heard me.

It's early in the morning. Like 9. And I don't know why I am up but I am. Haha. Today me and Krista are going to the mall. Maybe. If my parents let me. Apparently there is 2 belly button rings for 10 dollars. And my mother promised me that I could get a new one for Justins party, which might I add is only 3 weeks away. Haha. It's grand. I don't even know if I can go. Because there is this band thing where we have to go in on that Saturday and we have to play for CBC and they are recording us or whatever and it sucks because I don't know the music very well. Thats why all of March Break I am going to practice. Yeah right. Haha.

Last night Justin did not want to go to church with Jesse and Angus so he came to my house. And so did Krista ^^ and we made cookies. Okay. So I made cookies. Krista put the egg in and melted the butter...Oh and ate most of it. The cookie dough that is. Haha. And it was grand. And then they kept making my cd skip because they are stupid. And I drank Justins apple juice and he thought it was Krista which was grand. Haha. What else happened? Oh yeah, people, put pop in your mouth, like alot, and then swish it around. Shake your head like theres no tommorrow and then stop. And just wait for a second. SEE?!  Aint it cool!!!!!!! Haha. It's grand. What else happened? I kicked him in the balls does that count? Haha, he told me to get in the kitchen and make him some cookies, bitch. He actually called my a bitch. Not that I am apalled at that but whatever. I got him back ^^. And and we watched Salad Fingers!! All of the episodes since Justin had never seen them before and it was awesome. He said that some of the parts were kind of sketchy because he didn't know what the fuck was going on haha then again when does he?! Haha.

Kay so everyone my father is home. YAY! Kind of. We watched tv last night together haha. Sounds stupid but thats always what we used to do. We used to always watch Law and Order together or Friends or CSI or whatever was on that we both liked. Kay so thats not true, he sometimes tried to watch the Home Hardware network. *Shrugs shoulders and walks away*

Kay so I had two wierd dreams last night. 

The First One:

Alright so Krista told me that Rachel had given her a hot guys email. That is a true story right there and that is what my dream is based upon. Alright so. Me and her went to the mall and then she saw the guy, he was black, and I was like huh? And then they went off together and started making out and then he pulled out his cock and Krista started giving him head...It was so wierd. And I was made because she totally ditched me...So I went home...Haha...And then thats the end of that dream. Wierd eh?!

The Second One:

Alright so the second one is much wierder, in my opinion anyways. Alright so I was living with my dad and he got really angry at me one day, I can't remember why, but have any of you ever heard of the book Bluebeard? Alright, so in the book what happens is that that Bluebeard lives in this amazingly huge castle. He has been married several times but it just focus's on this one girl. The recent one. Alright so they both get married to eachother and she moves into the castle with him. One day he goes away and leaves her with all of the keys to all of the rooms in the castle. He told her that she could go into all of the rooms except for one. In which the room was forbidden to her, he showed her the key that she was not allowed to use and it was the smallest key. So he went away and one day she was curious. She thought that you know it's her house now too and she should be allowed in it. So what happens is that she goes down to the room that she is not allowed in and she puts the key in and opens it. And what she sees is horrific. She sees all of his ex wives, hanging on the wall. Dead. She runs back out the room but before she reaches the door she trips and drops the key into a pile of blood. She grabs the key and gets the hell outta there. Then what happens is that she trys to wash the blood off of the key but the blood won't come off. So when he comes home, she hides the key and hopefully he won't notice it is gone. So when he gets hpme and she passes him the ring of keys he automatically knows that the key is gone and he says to her ""Where is the key that I told you not to use?"" ""Oh, I must have left it in my room..."" so she runs upstairs and she has one final attempt to try and wash the blood off and while she is trying to wash it off, her husband comes upstairs and sees the blood on the key. He starts yelling at her that she went into the room and that he was going to kill her. So he goes downstairs to get a kinfe, she calls her brother, her brother and his friend come running and they kill Bluebeard. The end. Haha. Alright so back to my dream. My dad was angry and he hung me inside the wall next to all of his other wives...Except...I'm his daughtor...Haha...And so what happens is that I escape somehow and I sneak back inside and my mom sees me...And then I escape from the house...And I can't remember the rest...But it was really really wierd! Haha.

Alright, so I have had enough of typing. So bye...

Merry fricken' Christmas y'all"

I like Monkeys
Ugh, Kay. Everyone die says:
i like chicken
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece.
I thought this was odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth so I bought 200 of them.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I like monkeys.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one of them drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in the genitals. I laughed. They punched me in the genitals. I stopped laughing.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech and hurl themselves off the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into it's third hour.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive; they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sort of dropped dead. Kinda like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. God damn cheap monkeys.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room; on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs. I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet monkey and one hundred ninety-nine dead, dry monkeys.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I tried to pretend that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for a while, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad. I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in my toilet and I didn't want to call a plumber. I was embarrassed. I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
Unfortuantely there was only enough room for two at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't go bad.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I tried to burn them, but little did I know that my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire. Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and one hundred ninety-seven dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
The odor wasn't improving. I became agitated at my inability to dispose of the dead monkeys and I really had to use the bathroom. So I went and severely beat one of the monkeys. I felt better
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him I had a wet one. He couldn't take it either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't quite know what to say. They pretended to like them, but I could tell they were lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in the genitals.
Tommy D-> RV Show in 3 Days!!!!!!! says:
I like Monkeys.
Ugh, Kay. Everyone die says:
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHNAHNAHA

"event","Hello there evil fuckers. Haha.

Alright so the say started off good, obviously because I had some funny conversations with some funny people. Haha. It was grand. But, we didn't have eggs so I called Paul (Paula's father) when he was gone out to get Morris or coffee, I don't know which he was doing,  but of course he didn't pick up the phone so he called back and Paula told him to pick up eggs. But he didn't. He forgot. Because he is the most UNCOOLEST person there is. So we called Zach to bring us some eggs. And he offered us bacon. For all of you that don't know Zach lives up the street. So he came. And he hid the blanket from me, in the most obvious place you could hide something. In someones closet you say? Why that is correct. Haha. Yes, well, I am stupid enough not to find it. So before he went home he showed me where it was and I felt like an idiot. Of course. So we ate food, bacon and eggs. And ice tea. It was good. And after that I think we went downstairs to watch our Trailor Park Boys Marathon. Yes I know it was supposed to be Buffy but stupid Blockbuster wouldn't let us get them because...well...they didn't have them there haha. They should have known we were coming. Haha. I know its a little bit unreasonable but shut up. So yes. We had a Trailor Park Boys Marathon and it was damn grand. Haha. And in between the first epsisoded my dad came home. Good fucking timing eh? I thought so too. Anywho yes he brought this girl Charlin? (SHAR-LIN) Haha. Yeah she was cool, we used to be playmates whenever we were younger. I can't remember how old she is but she quit high school and now she is gone back in it to finish it. Haha. Whatever. Dumb children dropping out. What else happened today? Ummm....After my father left he came back. Haha. Yes, he went to drop Charlen off at her friends house or whatever and then he came back but by that time we were busy wathing the Trailor Park Boys and it was damn grand. Haha. During tha ttime, I put on fake nails though they suck kinda because they won't stay on my damn fingers. Because they hate me. After the Trailor Park Boys I called Ryan and he was having a shindig I guess with Alex and Nathan which he failed to tell me about last night. But me and Alex were talking on the phone which never happens so that was good and I had fun because we said some pretty interesting things to eachother (non sexual...actually they were but its not bad! haha) and then I was talking to Ryan again, told him to say he was sorry a couple of times, he asked me why and then I made up a phony reason and pretended I was mad and so he said he was sorry. Hehe. I just like to have the power. And then Nathan and Alex said he was whipped. Which my dears...he certainly is. Haha. I love it. Well he is to a certain point. But yes, afer that his sister needed to use the phone and so we said goodbye and then I went upstairs. Oh yes, and while I was on the phone with Alex, I decided to do an experiment. I wanted to light a candle and then throw it at Paula to see if it would go out in the air. Paula said that it obviously would and if it didn't hten I would light the whole damn house on fire. In which I almost did....Haha. *is ashamed* alright so the candle didn't go out when I threw it across the room and so I'm an idiot. haha. Yes. And she threw nail polish at my face and it almost hit me too! Haha. It was some grand shit going on right there. And then when I got off the phone we went upstairs and we were going to have a saonce but we didn't because we didn't have any one to call. Yes well I have to go now because Paula's mom is getting angry at me. Byes.

Merry fuckin' Christmas all."

"event","Alright so yes, I added my friend Josh to my friends list...go to his lj and read what he put about me ^^ I'm so proud!!!!!!!!! YES! haha

Anywho, not going to Antigonish, as I have probably already mentioned but meh.

Ryan is grounded for being suspended, for skipping. So does that technically mean that he is grounded for skipping? Or for being suspended? I don't understand, all I know is that he is grounded and that I cannot talk to him for a while. But hopefully he is coming down on March Break and I might be able to see him ^^ If that is at all possible what with his no brain and all sheesh.

There is no band for me this morning ^^ Athena called me this morning and she said that she wasn't going to be coming for me YAY! Which means yes I had to get up early and all but still, I am showered, dressed, make upped, and ready to rumble! haha. Which also means that I have some free time to myself for an hour and a half Yay!

I might be going to Paula's house tonight, to have a Buffy The Vampire Slayer marathon ^^ and then I'm going to go to the mall when I get home with Krista, and Paula can come to. I am not excluding her from anything haha. What else is going on right now. 

I told Alex last night that all girls maturbated. He was quite appaled when I told him that I was going to watch porn. 

Me: ""Bah, I hope these fuckers leave soon, I want to watch the porn that I downloaded""
Alex: ""...But your a girl...I don't even watch porn! Masturbation!""
Me: ""If a girl ever tells you that she doesn't masturbate, she's lying! For every guy that masturbates there is a girl that masturbates as well""

Hahahaha. I thought it was funny too guys. And if you didn't then...you suck...haha.

Oh yes I also gave my vagina to Alex, and he put it on his shelf. Haha. Oh dear, we are messed up. 

I don't know what else to say. I'll talk about my sleep. I went to sleep at 7:30 last night. Haha. Nerd? I know. I think I might be adapting to Ryan's habits. He usually goes to ""nap"" at like 4 and then wakes up at like 7 and then doesn't go to bed until like 12 or 1. Haha. I think its funny because whenever I try to call him at 6 his brother is always like ""He's asleep"" I just sigh and wait for him to call me back.

Anywho. What else has happened. Oh yeah, yesterday we got out early for lunch. Haha. Because of this winter carnival thingamabobber or something, I looked at it as an oppertunity to get my science homework done and passed in. Good thing I did because I definately wouldn't have done it last night because of the whole sleeping bit at 7:30. Haha. 

My mother just told me that my Aunt Emma broke her wrist, oh dear thats not good. She was at work and she was standing on a stool and she fell off. I tried to hold in the laughtor too by's it's okay.

I'm getting a new bellybutton ring for Justin's party! Which is on April 2nd for you guys who didn't know that. I missed it last year because of the whole swim meet and such but I asked my friend Bryan who is on another team, if there was an swim meets coming up and he said that he was hosting one on the weekend of the 10th..Whenever that is right? I thought so too. Haha. 

Oh yes, I might have to put Meeko, my oldest cat, down because he has been peeing on things lately, well more than usual. He peed on my bag and he also peed on my jacket. Why the hell is my cat going after MY stuff?! Haha. But more importantlu I don't want him to be put down. *cries* I want him to stay alive forever!! Haha. But I know that that isn't going to happen and I know that it might be for be for the best.

Anywho. I am off because I have nothing else better to say.

Ps. Merry Christmas to all you fat fucks. Haha *Love me*"

Okay, well I think today is the day that they are going to be calling home because everything hasn't been going that good today. Ugh I had to get up for band this mornng and oh my god, Mallory is mad at me. Grr on her. She is mad at me because me and Grace went to her house yesterday for lunch because we had nothing else better to do, usually people would be happy that someone has just dropped in to see them but no not Mallory because she sucks like that. She gave me glares today and yesterday her and Charlotte and Jenn (Frazer) were walking ahead of me and Grace because they were mat us. But I think it was just Mallory because Charlotte seemed to be find with me and I don't really talk to Jen that much so I think it is just Mallory. Oh well, she will get over it. Big deal? I think not. Alright so Kristian is like right beside me because she's a loner, and she's with Sidney her only friend. I'm not going to say anything mean about her because I don't feel like getting into anything and hurting people. This morning I watched two movies, one in English class and one in Calm class. Awesome? I think so. We watched ""Pleasantville"" in English class because it apparently relates to the book The Giver, and in Calm class we watched the rest of Pirates of the Carribean, that movie has nothing to do with anything that we are doing in class. Haha. Before the people were like Oh my god you have Mr. Williams for Calm and band and now they are wishing they had Mr. Williams. Yes. I hate guys by the way, someone just called me Sweetie, fuck him. Haha. I don't like people at all today.
My friend is in the hospital, I suppose I shouldn't say any names because well some people don't like me talk about them or whatever but yes, she went on an overdose of pills last night. I'm scared for her. Krista was like crying today at the beginning of school and I know that she is doing crappy because she is so close to her and stuff. Well I guess she isn't going to have a march break, and I don't think I am either because if the teachers phone my parents then they are going kill me, because now if you miss over 4 absents then they are going to call home and I know that I have missed over 4 classes, skipping of course. Because I am an idiot. I know this. I know that I am not going to skip any more this semester, and not a lot next semester.
Alright so the swim meet was fun kind of. Me and Matt had a good time, he was incredibly hyper after the first session on Friday I think it was haha, it was grand, I pushed if off the bed (now don't you guys getting dirrty things into your minds) and then he couldn't stop laughing and I don't think that I have ever seen him laugh so much in his life haha. It was grand. And what else happened, oh yeah he was trying to hit my head but I guess I moved it and he hit his hand on the top of the car, so funny. Haha. And my boyfriend is an idiot because he couldn't find me, he went in every place except for the main place that I told him. Haha. Oh well. Alex was like ""Give me your cell phone number so that this doesn't happen next time"" haha. I laughed at him.
Can you stop talking to me now?! Stupid guy. ""Oh she's staring at me"" oh yes, because I want you so much you fat pig.
Haha.
I love thee Paula and hopefully we are going to have a Buffy the Vampire Slayer marathon this weekend. 
P to the square. Yes. Thats right, that means Pink Pimp to you people. Anywho I have to go now because Josh is here. Ta."

"event","Today, no band! WoOt! I got up early anyways but its nice that I acutally don't have to worry about my drive coming early or whatever. However I have to sit all alone on the bus as Krista as a doctors appointment at the hospital. I'm really worried about Katie because her heart rate is so low that she is not allowed to drive her car. And she might be admitted into the hospital soon. I hate this. Two of my friends are bulimic. Yay?! Grr. When Katie stepped into my ouse I swear to god she was a toothpick, she wasn't always like that. And it makes me sad. I mean Krista isn't that bad with it and all but I mean Katie does it after ever meal and she does realize that she is going to die soon. *Screams at the top of her lungs*
Anywho.
I'm leaving for Antigonish tonight. Yay? Haha, there will be nothing to do all night but hopefully we get to go somewhere like...er...I don't know. Haha. Yes. Either we leave tonight or tommorrow morning. At like 3 am, be damned if I'm going to leave that early in the morning haha. Yes.
Well, yesterday I vowed not to skip any more classes until next sememster, strictly because I have skipped too many times now and my mother is probably going to find out about it since it is going to be on my report card. And, if I skip anymore then my teachers are going to start phoning home, oh my. That would not be a pretty picture. They are probably already going to be phoning home. 
Yesterday I got kicked out of math class, for the first time yay! I threw a pen at Ross's face ^^ haha and then the teacher was like ""Erin, get out"" and then I did but he let me back in and he was like ""This is the warning, if you do it again then there will be consequences."" haha. I laughed at him. Well, not directly to his face but I still laughed at him. Then my phone started ringing, lucklily I had it in vibrate haha. It was Grace because I had sent her a text message earlier saying that she had better leave Cole Harbour Place soon because she was skipping and I didn't want her to be late for her next class, so she called me, twice.
Then, in Science, I called her and she answered it uner the desk of course, and she spoke with one of those accents you know the guy on the Simpsons Abu?...Thats not his name I don't think...I think thats the monkeys name on Aladdin...Haha...But yes, you all know who I'm talking about. Yes, and then I couldn't stop laughing haha it was funny. Oh oh, and then my teacher said ERECTION! Haha. She meant to say direction but she said ""Erection"" and me and Grace and Ryan just burst out laughing because she said it and it was soooo funny haha. I laughed. That was a good science class. And today is my last day before the weekend, joyus. haha. This is all I wished to say. Oh yeah, Grace came over yesterday and we had a fun time. Everybody, look up ""piss"" in google images and look at the first image that comes up. Hahahah. Soooo funny. 

""Yo mama so fat her legs is like spoiled milk - white & chunky!""

Hahhahaha.

And then Krista came over last night and we had a pillow fight and we had a chocolate bar each and we watched Freaky Friday. It was grand.

Yes, and now that is all I wished to say. Haha. *Loves Ryan*"

"event","Well, today I skipped math and apparently they call your parents after like 4 things you have skipped but I suppose it's my own fault. So I wrote a note saying that I was at the doctors but I'm sure that he is still going to call my parents and stuff. Ugh. Obvioulsy I won't be going to Antigonish next week. ARG. Why the hell am I so stupid!? I vow never to skip again, until next semester.
But in the meantime Grace is supposed to be coming over after school and we are going to look for Disney sexual stuff and watch Hellsing because I still have it from Blockbuster. Wootness. I'm still deciding what to have for supper since she is a veggetarian but I'm sure my mom will find something for us to eat haha. And then my mom is going out and so I shall be alone. YAY! I'll probably end up talking to Ryan all night till my mom kicks me off the phone haha. Anywho.
I'm tired and wish to die. That is all I wish to say, and that I love Paulaface, and Ryanface."

"event","Well, there is no school today. And this is fucking bullshit because my mother has babysitting kids, they have to go to school because there are no busses but there is school. And its fucking bullshit because I wanted to watch Gothika and I can't because my mother has the three kids and she's like ""No your not watching that when they are here you can watch it when they go to school"" I can barely do anything around here with my moms fricken kids around here and it sucks ass. All march break she is going to have them and I can't do shit all. I can't watch tv, I'm going to wake up to them screaming at eachother or laughing at like 7 in the morning so I can't stay up late and watch my movies and plus I just don't like them. John is in grade 8 and he is still getting babysat at my moms house. MESSED UP!!!.!!!!.! And he's ruining my fun time over March Break. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

But in the meantime I have to go because I have nothing else to say. *Loves Ryan*"

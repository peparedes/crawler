"event","My 2 summoner spells, which I go with almost exclusively are
[spell=exhaust][spell=teleport]
The reasoning: Early game, when mocking shout is more of an inconvenience slow, this will let you keep champions in range for you to finish. It also heavily debuffs damage of both AP and AD champions now, which can also be critical in the under-6 part of the game. Teleport is obviously excellent for almost any champion, and while late game Trynd gets a nice bit of speed from Phantom Dancers, early game you want to be able to spend as much time in lane as possible farming so that you can right click to win later. Also, while not ideal, teleport can be used to escape ganks faster than recalling in a bush.  Since in the latest update of the guide, I change the focus to solo top, the Teleport can let you get a quick edge on your opponent by going back to buy with a minimum of lane time lost.

Other good choices
[spell=cleanse]
One of the ways in which many enemys will finish off a Tryndamere is by CCing him near the end of Undying Rage. This is one of the 2 most common ways you will die as Tryndamere (the other being DOT effects/champions). However, I prefer the Quicksilver Sash if this is a problem you're facing. Not only is it BETTER than cleanse (it removes DoTs and other debuffs, not just CC), but it's very affordable, on a fairly short CD, and gives you some MR which will give you more time to wail on their team before having to rage and GTFO.

[spell=ignite]
Similar to Exhaust, this can help you get some early game kills. I've had Taric's escape by the skin of their stun with just barely over a heals worth of HP in an early bush fight, and ignite would have taken care of that. However, I tend not to take it because late game, Trynd will carve through HP like butter anyway. If you know the enemy team has a lot of healing/lifesteal, this may still be a better choice than exhaust, but in solo normal, I always go exhaust.

[spell=flash]
Another escape/closer. Pretty redundant in my opinion with Spinning Slash, but I suppose you could justify it as anything that keeps you from dying is good. As a couple of comments have mentioned low level dives with Flash can give you some early levels, and flash is never a bad choice.

[spell=ghost] is probably one of the overall best summoner spells in the game, with a significant move speed buff that lasts for a pretty decent length of time. Good for chasing, running away, getting to a team fight, pretty much any time you want to move faster. However, with Phantom Dancers, Trynd will already outrun most champions most of the time, and once he gets in shout range, very few champions will ever escape.

Poor spell choices

[spell=revive]
The usual reason: Dying is something to be avoided.

[spell=heal]
Trynd's own self healing should be more than sufficient for keeping you alive outside of team fights, and heal wouldn't save you in a team fight.

[spell=clarity]
The worst possible spell for Tryndamere. You don't have mana.

[spell=surge]
Surge is one of the new spells, replacing Rally.  It's an attack speed buff for Trynd, but not worth taking. The main users of this spell are AP/AS hybrids like Kayle.

[spell=Clairvoyance]
A great spell, but better taken by a more support oriented character.

[spell=smite]
Used by junglers. While Trynd can jungle, this guide is more about laning as Tryndamere, though I will add a jungling section later when I've had time to experiment and practice a jungle build.

[spell=promote]
I can't say I've gotten much use out of this on any champion I play,, and Trynd doesn't need a minions help farming


[rune=Greater Mark of Desolation]x9
[rune=Greater Seal of Malice]x9
[rune=Greater Glyph of Malice]x9
[rune=Greater Quintessence of Malice]x3
This will give you +12% crit starting, and 15 ArP.

Mastery I go 21/0/9, but that last p
oint in utility is pretty flexible (Ie, if you want to go 22/0/8).  The talents to take in Offense should be clear. I skipped Demolitionist (Trynd is already a great tower destroyer), and the lifesteal talent (because my build includes it already, and I valued getting Quickness in Utility).  As mentioned, the last point in utility can be placed almost anywhere.  Prior to the 11/29/2011 patch, I was using it for extended monster buffs, but you could make an case for Greed, the ward radius talent, quicker recalls, or one last point in Offense.

I've started assembling my crit dmg rune set, but it's very expensive.  I haven't yet gotten to test how the sacrifice of early game crit trades off against end game damage.


For Solo Top:
I have returned to generally starting with a [item=Vampiric Scepter].  As I have shifted to a mainly solo top role, I frequently oppose champs against whom I can maintain regular harass and farm.  I would still consider starting with a rejuv bead for a lane in which I would need to hug the tower for a few levels.  The build is still functionally the same as a duo lane, with a couple major notes:  Consider going for an [item=Executioner's Calling] especially if the lane opponent has a strong heal/sustain mechanic, if there are no other AD to benefit from the eventual Stark's, or if the enemy has strong support healers (Soraka, Sona,etc). 

When solo top, I try and head back around 500 gold (depending on how the lane is going).  Knowing that I'm goingback, I play my first few levels very aggressively.  On my return, I complete the [item=Emblem of Valour] and buy the [item=Vision ward]. Why a pink ward, you ask?  Well, assuming the enemy solo has warded, you'll get back 25 of the gold by killing their ward, and deny them sight that protects them from ganks. Also helpful if facing a Twitch or Evelynn, rare as that is.  Now, you're going to stay in line for a while.  You want to be able to purchase at least [item=Berserker's Greaves] and the +crit item for your [item=Zeal].  The trip after that complete Zeal,and get either a BF Sword (if you can afford it) or more likely a [item=Cloak of Agility]. From here, complete the [item=Infinity Edge] as soon as you can afford.

For Duo Bottom
Personally, I like to start with a [item=Rejuvenation Bead]. I used to start with [item=Vampiric Scepter], but frequently, I found going against ranged harassers would deny me the ability to actually hit minions for getting your life back. With the Rejuv bead, you can hold up at the tower and still recover health. Once you have 550 gold, recall and get [item=Emblem of Valour] and then teleport back to the lane. You lose almost no time thanks to teleport, and now you and your lane partner have a pretty decent amount of health regen+your own lifesteal. Your 2nd rank of Bloodlust should be coming in by now too. Once you hit 5 and your 3rd rank, Bloodlust+[item=Emblem of Valour] should make you extremely difficult to harass, barring certain enemy champion combination's. Now, you should be able to farm contentedly for a while. Stay in until you have a decent chunk of gold. Note, that is is EXTREMELY important for you to use some of your own judgment here. Remember that you do not have boots at this point, which can put you at a real disadvantage. Ideally, you'll reach over 1k gold by the time your teleport is up again, in which case, feel free to make use of it to retrieve your [item=Berserker's Greaves], or just the [item=Boots of Speed] if you can't afford them by the time you're back. However, if you don't need the speed (for example, you are already faster than your opponents, or your lane partner has powerful slows or taunts), feel free to hang out as long as you feel you can afford to operate without boots. If the enemy is particularly stun or immobilize heavy (particularly if they are also AP heavy), [item=Mercury Treads] may be a better choice than Berserker's, but your DPS will be noticeably less for it.

Once you have your T2 boots, the next item on your agenda is a [item=Zeal], or at the very least it's components ([item=Brawler's Gloves] first if you must choose]). Zeal is an amazing item, it speeds up your attack speed (more attacks = more chances to crit), gives you crit, and perhaps most importantly, gives you move speed. Should bring you to about 420 move, which should be plenty for the time being. Next, we start on the item which is the very soul of a Tryndamere, the [item=Infinity Edge].

It is EXTRAORDINARILY unlikely that you can just buy the entire IE at once. I almost always start with [item=Cloak of Agility] which brings your crit to about 42% at 100% HP. Whether you get the [item=Pickaxe] or [item=B. F. Sword] next is largely up to you. The Pickaxe costs half of what the BF sword does for half the damage it gives, so the order is pretty unimportant. I'd go with the BF if possible, but if team fights have already started at this point, you made need the smaller damage boost earlier. Either way, you're getting both and then finishing the IE.


Post Laning Phase
It is around this point that the game starts to belong to you. Next, we upgrade [item=Zeal] into [item=Phantom Dancer] or start [item=Phage]. Phage is great is the enemy is particularly kite-oriented or is frequently fleeing, and also gives us a bit extra HP. This boosts our move to a very respectable 442, and makes us swing like a crazy dude, crit'ing virtually every swing. Note that if a particular champion has been a problem for your team, now is the time you begin to counter build them.

At this point, you are completely ready to dominate the game, if you haven't already. You can carve through squishy's in probably 2 seconds flat, and even tanks can't ignore you for long. It's up to you to decide whether to complete the [item=Frozen Mallet] or [item=Phantom Dancer] first, but both are core in all but the most unusual cases. So what items you build next is somewhat up to you. Here are some common choices for me below:

[item=Stark's Fervor] Stark's is pretty much one of the best items in the game. You already have the Emblem of Valour from early laning phase, so all you need is another 1750 and you get a lifesteal and attack speed aura for your team, and an armor debuffing aura that affects your enemies. Pretty much the only time this is not incredibly awesome is if someone else on your team has built it already, it sort loses some of the appeal. However, I often wait to build this till after I complete Phantom Dancers, IE, and depending on the flow of the game, a defensive item or two.

[item=The Black Cleaver] or [item=Last Whisper] Enemy tanks are likely to have good armor, and tanky DPS are as well. Depending on which is being more of a problem, take one of these. Both give good AD, and the cleaver boosts your AS even more (though it costs about 1k gold more too).  Frankly, I almost never get the Cleaver.  With the new Mastery's, Last Whisper makes for a 46% ArP. Only a pure armor build can really stand up to that, and that's why you have AP teammates.  LW has practically become core in any game in which enemy team members purchase armor items for me.

[item=Sword of the Occult] Always fun when you're dominating a game. However, I can't recall having gotten this item since hitting Summoner L20. I'm going to go with almost 100% of the time, you are better off with a defensive item in your 5th and 6th slows, or a hybrid item like Frozen Mallet, or something like a Bloodthirster to give you a nice Lifesteal chunk with your AD. Frankly, I can't think of a time I've used this in a real game as Tryndamere.

[item=Quicksilver Sash]A personal favorite of mine for MR, this item is great for when the enemy team tries to keep you there with only a second left on UR. Also great for: Ruining the day of any Malzahar, Vlad, or Warwick who ults you. Nothing like watching their ult dissipate in the press of a button right before you cut them in half to give you that ""Pwned, noob"" feeling.

[item=Guardian Angel]Do you want to frustrate the hell out of the enemy team? GA is for you. Gives some nice all round defensive bonuses, and the getting back up is nice too. Don't rely on using it to rejoin a fight, since you'll probably have burned rage before it activates, but at least they didn't get a kill on you, and you can return in a minute after you go whack a few jungle mobs to heal to full.  I've only done this once as a troll build, with a Zilean and Yorick on my team. 

[item=Force of Nature] or [item=Randuin's Omen] or [item=Thornmail] For teams that are overstacked on one damage type or the other. Thornmail for physical and FoN for magic. FoN has the added bonus of more move speed and a ton of health regen, and a Trynd wearing it is pretty much the terror of the battlefield to any caster. Thornmail is less devastating because melee characters generally try and avoid slugging it out with Trynd to begin with. The FoN combined with a [item=Frozen Mallet] is even better, as it increase Trynd to having near 3k health, improving both the regen effect and giving him a slow on attack.  Randuin's can be a very solid choice (it slows people attacking you and gives you a second AOE slow as it's active), and the HoG component will mitigate the cost somewhat. 

[item=Bloodthirster] is on it's face a great item.  Unfortunetly, you'll usually have to either get armor pen or defensive items or utility in your last 2 slots, and if you need none by the time you can afford this, you're already winning too hard anyway.


Certain champions are particularly easy or difficult for Tryndamere at various phases of the game, and certain champions are very dangerous when paired with certain partners or types of partners.

Teemo
Teemo gets first mention because I hate him. I hate his stupid adorable face, and I want him to report for execution, not for duty. I hate his stupid mushrooms in the bushes in the jungle, and I hate when his poison outlasts UR and finishes me after I leave a fight, and I hate when he used to be able to blind-exhaust-blind me. Fortunately for me, Teemo is squishy. REALLY squishy. Unfortunately, he's also really good at running away. If he's harassing you early in your lane, whirling to him and smacking him a few times is usually a good way to discourage him, but...

By around L5-6, your healing should pretty much outdamage his harass. Most Teemo's nowaday seem to go AP/AS, so if there's a powerful AP carry, that FoN you should be getting will mitigate him as well. But he's still worth bewaring.

Teemo/CC partner
This is where Teemo becomes a real danger to Trynd. With a stun, taunt, or immobilize capable partner, Teemo becomes fairly safe from counter attack by a solo Tryndamere. A stun on Trynd after he's whirled to Teemo is likely to be fatal for Trynd, or at the least, force a rage. At this point, you may be best off retreating to your tower until your lane partner or jungle can assist you in killing the damn munchkin.

Lee Sin, the Blind Monk
Whoa boy. Lee Sin is a pretty hard counter for Trynd. He slows your attack speed with Cripple, gains armor and lifesteal from his shield, and most of the successful builds I've seen have been fairly tanky. Oh, and he can chase pretty well by combining Safeguard and Sonic Wave. His ult also deals a pretty big burst compared to his other moves and can take you offguard. It also lets him get away pretty effectively if you're beating him in a fight. If you can make him miss you with Tempest though, you've got the edge.  Lee Sin is often played as a jungle now.  If you dodge his Q, you can usually escape him easily when he ganks.

Caitlyn
If Caitlyn starts in your lane, she's actually not that bad. She can harass you, but if your partner is helping you control the bush, it's not too bad. Where Caitlyn becomes a real problem for Trynd is if she starts mid and then leaves mid to harass other lanes (which puts her damage generally above your ability to heal). She is difficult to 1 v 1 for Trynd in a lane because of her ability to control the bushes with her traps and range. Her sniper shot can (and usually will) strike after Rage ends, resulting in your unfortunate demise.

Stealth Champions
Other than the usual oracles/vision wards solutions, Trynd has a special advantage in detecting stealthed champions. If Mocking Shout is useable, but there's no one visible around, there is a stealther near you (also useful for bush checking!). Retreat to a tower, or at least get some help, a gank is probably coming your way. Akali's smokebomb is also a real pain for Trynd, but when trying to outlast it, just head for the nearest bunch of minions and start carving em up for health. This will matter less after the stealth rework, but that's not in yet.

Galio
It used to be that Galio's ult basically amounted to suicide if he caught Tryndamere in it, because a Tryndamere, combined with the rest of his team, would often kill the Galio before the ult ended, accomplishing little. Now that his ult has built in damage reduction, try and stay spread out. Your still likely to be the 'target' of the ult, but try not to let him take your AP teammates with you.

Fiddlesticks
Don't panic when he starts fearing and draining you. As long as you've gotten your IE, you can cut him down faster than he can probably drain you and his silence won't do shit to help him. And when he gets you low, rage and just take his face off. That being said, I hate Fiddle almost as much as Teemo and I often get an Executioners Calling just for him (and the lifesteal+crit isn't bad). If he gets the drop on your team with crowstorm, focus him. Your ult will buy you the time to at least remove him from the field, and you may even live afterwords to enjoy it.

Udyr
Ugh. Udyr is one of the most frustrating champions in the game for Tryndamere (and I think everyone else), just because he runs super fast with his turtle shield on, and then when you get to him, he stuns you and runs off again. Frozen Mallet or help from your teammates is really all you can do to kill him.   He is extremely dangerous to solo top Tryndamere.  If you don't have good awareness of your minimap (or didn't ward), he can come out of the jungle and stun you very quickly, before you can fall back to your turret.  Beware the Udyr jungle.  BEWARE

Rammus
If you need to kill a Rammus, wait for his Defensive Curl to go off. Rammus is actually surprisingly squishy when that isn't on, and hitting him while it is is likely to do next to nothing (and it has a damage return). If a Rammus is pursing you, try and run him into minion lines. In the jungle, consider whacking a camp mob so that they follow you and crowd the already narrow path in the jungle for him to run into. Try and fight near minions, every Rammus ever has Sunfire and will draw some aggro from minions and you will have a convenient source to hit for lifestealing your health back to survive tremors.

Yi
Free kill, 1 v 1, unless Yi realizes this in time to pop his ultimate and run away. Yi's should never engage a Tryndamere alone unless fed to godly levels. The only real other danger I can see is the AP Yi build might surprise burst a Trynd before he ults, but you can see the Alpha Strike coming, so shouldn't really occur.

Jax
Pre Phantom Dancer nerf, my advice was Do Not Confront. Now, they have more manageable dodge, but you may want to consider a sword of the occult anyway if they're doing well. Do not stand toe to toe with a Jax. Jax gains a stacking attack speed buff, so when fighting him, whack him a few times, and then run off until you see the buff dissipate off him, then re-engage. Smart Jax's will keep this up by hitting your minions, try not to fight him near them (this is doubly true, as they will attack him, miss, and give him more dodge/stuns). Even if fed well above Jax, do not underestimate him, he can ruin your day.  They are apparently planning to remove Dodge from the game, this may bring swift justice to Jax players.

Singed
Another champion with an annoying ability to run away, if you don't catch him almost immedialty during pursuit, back off. You are chasing through a poison cloud (if the Singed is even halfway competent) and when you are low enough, Singed will turn around, throw you, and then spray goo on you to slow you. As mentioned earlier however, Singed can be a great laning partner for early game kills. A FoN+Frozen Mallet can be an effective counter to his strategy, but still, you're usually better off doing something else.

Pantheon
Pantheon has been at various points kinda scary. Since his stun length and burst damage was nerfed, he is now actually kind of squishy, and nowhere near as dangerous. The key is to remember that your first hit will always be blocked, and to walk around his Heartseeker strike (in other words, don't stand in the spears).

Sona/Taric/Soraka
Generally, you will be able to outdamage the healer as long as you can sustain damage on the target (meaning they don't stun you). However, I prefer to just kill the healer whenever possible. Taric is particularly vicious with a ranged harasser in early game however, as he can stun you in place when you whirl in and then shatter to lower your armor while the ranged (or just his minons) tears you up.

Taric also gets special mention as a good support duo bottom.  His shatter let's Tryndamere tear foes apart, especially combined with Dazzle for a stun.

Karthus
Karthus is pretty easy to kill (Though he'll remain in the fight for 8 more seconds after that), but the reason he's getting a mention is his ult. Karthus's LOVE to use their ult to finish a Tryndamere who has escaped and whose rage has worn off. I STRONGLY reccomend MR against a Karthus. Even if you just buy a [item=Negatron cloak] and nothing else. On most champions I would say a BV, but the lack of mana on Trynd makes that suboptimal. Here's a fun fact though: Quicksilver Sash cleanses Karthus's ult. That's right, his ult is like Vlad's on a global scale in that there's a debuff that triggers the damage at the end. Pop... no ult.

Edit: This is no longer the case for Karthus's ult.

Nocturne
Nocturne is one of the newer champions, and a personal favorite of mine when I play to play a ganking assassin. His only real danger to Tryndamere is if you're at low life and you see Paranoia (Nocturne's Ultimate) go up, you may want to consider a pre-emptive rage. If you think you can survive it, feel free to just wait for him to show up. A lot of Nocturne's power comes from his ArP combined with the panic that losing sight of everything on the map causes, but in a straight up slugging match, he should be no match for Trynd. If you dodge his Q attack (the claw thing), he's pretty much screwed, as it is a major damage source for him. Oh, and his fear is a bitch too, but no more than anyone else with a 2 second CC.

Vayne
Fuck Vayne. I don't think anyone else as bad to go against as Vayne for Tryndamere. She can rapidly attack, close, and retreat, deals lots of burst, and can knock you away, stun, and escape with easy. She gets faster when she chases so if you move to engage, you pretty much have to committ, because running will kill you. This is where having a stunner is essential, because a decent Vayne will roll around you, shoot you into a wall and stun you, and you'll be half dead and she'll be halfway up the lane before you catch up.

Riven
A skilled Riven can be a major threat, particularly in Dominion.  Try and juke her stun (ie, run in close, and immediatly back off, the range is very short), because if you manage this, you will probably have her.  She can't usually win a straight slug fest with Trynd, but she usually doesn't have to.  Her high mobility let's her escape easily even when slowed.  In Dominion, where she doesn't really need to farm, she is much worse, as farming is probably her main weak point.

Wukong
Wukongs main threats come from his ult, and his ability to harass in lane. Counter his use of decoy with a pink ward in the lane, if you have to go up against him.

Fizz
Fizz isn't too scary, at least not for Trynd.  When trying to kill him, be extremely aware of his little pole stand move.  While he's in the middle of it, he will be unaffected by Mocking Shout."

"event","So my birthday is in 4 hours, and I'm not really feeling that great, for two reasons.  One, I'm exhausted from not sleeping much this weekend, and I have a stuffed up nose.  Two, I finally just mustered up the backbone to tell Tennessee Teresa that I don't want to date her anymore.  The long distance thing is not working for me at all, and having a girlfriend I just don't really care about feels wrong on so many levels.  I know I'm making the right decision, I just feel guilty about how heartbroken she is (as well as being somewhat concerned that she'll go and do something stupid).  Right now, she's just trying to cling to the relationship because I think this is the only half-decent relationship she's ever had (and also the first time a guy has broken up with her instead of the other way around).  

Just the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the only area where we really mutually hit off to the same degree was sexually (which I must conceded, we did have excellent compatibility, though I might have preferred if she was more of a sub once subdued).  I mean, we enjoyed some of the same movies and shows, so that wasn't really like terrible incompatibility, but I always felt like we had to struggle when selecting something to watch together.  And our political and religious views are just about as polar opposite as they get.  And there's all these little things, po-tato- po-ta-to kind of stuff that we disagree on, like Marvel vs DC.  Everyone knows Marvel is a way better comic-verse, but she prefers DC.  By itself that's not a big deal (or even anything other than a ""eh, why?""), but there's all kinds of little stuff like that.  And it's not like she did anything wrong, she just... didn't do all the right things.  I wanted so bad to get her into some of the games me and my friends played, the way most of my ex's have been, but she only maintained interested as long as I sat her in my lap and was like ""PLAY, WOMAN!""  Megan for example, got so into Dragon Age that she actually quit when she foudn out she was gonna have to choose between herself or her in-game romance dying or her in-game romance sleeping with Morrigan, because she was so upset at the idea of having to make that choice.  I love that she empath'd with her game character to that degree (and that since we talked about DA:O recently, she's been playing it frequently.  I think she has 3 play throughs going).  Even Jo used to be more fun than and put more effort into playing with me than Teresa did.  Well, rather, Teresa put in the effort to try, but I knew she was only playing to try and please me."

"event","I know that if you were just reading this journal to get a viewpoint on my life, this entry may leave you feeling like you missed a lot.  You did.  I'm not here to talk about all the things that happened since my last entry, I'm here to talk about what happened last night.

Around 9:38 pm, right before the pull in which we killed Heroic-mode Dreamwalker in ICC (or healed her, or however you want to phrase it), I was glancing at my Steam friends list and realized Megan wasn't anywhere on it.  To confirm I wasn't just somehow missing something I ran to Facebook to check, and sure enough she had de-friended me there as well.  I  quickly sent her a ""Hey!"" text and attempted to call her, which I got immediately directed to voice mail.  I told Dan about it, and then told Aaryndon that if possible, I wanted to be swapped out because something had come up that wasn't strictly an emergency, but that I wanted to take care of right away.  While we're in mid Dreamwalker pull, I get a long text which opens with her saying she decided that she isn't ready to be friends with me, and the part that I really think upset me where she said I was a poison sapping her personality and causing her stress.  I was becoming increasingly stressed myself the more I read this and thought about it.  And while Sindragosa normal mode went smoothly (as well it should by this point), Lich King was a disaster.  THREE out of the four times I got targeted with defile, I dropped it practically in the middle of the raid.  Rightfully so, Don was furious with me, and I was furious at myself.  If I had been raid lead, I would have kicked me out after the 2nd time, and the third would have had me screaming my head off.  We didn't kill him last night, though we were close several times and I completely blame myself for this.  Teresa (Dan and Aura's friend from Tennesse) and Dan tried to cheer me up, and while they succeeded in taking my mind off things for a little bit, I woke up this morning unable to think about anything but being told I was poison by a girl that I have spent over three years of my life with.  And it's like a slideshow of happy memories won't stop playing in my head now, where I can so clearly recall staggering off the train at Hull station and her running to me, and how happy she was to see me, and then staggering through Hull (and nearly getting run over by a bus) to collapse on her cot of a bed and sleep for like near eighteen hours.  Or how she used to be fun and laugh and actually be pleasant to be around, instead of this stern, disapproving, shrew of a woman that she is now, where every little thing pisses her off to no end and she spends all her time hating things and disliking things and complaining about this and that.  Right after we broke up, I thought the change was my fault, and in a way I still think it is.  But more likely than me sucking out all the sunshine and replacing it with venom, I think more likely is that the sunshine was just the outer coating and all that venom was already in her from her being unhappy pretty much her entire grade school life (much as the venom in me comes from my younger years, and Joanna just helped me learn to spit it).  

So now I guess we'll see what happens.  I REALLY wish she had waited like two more days to decide this, so that she could have been there for the boss fight in D&D against the quori... I'm still not sure that thing won't stomp the party into the ground, even with the ludicrously healing twinked cleric that Robert is putting together for that new guy.  If it works as he says, he can do a 13 HP heal EVERY ROUND, which is crazy."

"event","So still haven't picked up a new job yet.  I think it's because I keep limiting myself to places I WANT to work rather than just any place that will hire me.  Unsurprisingly, most of the places I want to work are fairly hotly contested.

Entertainment news: I don't think I've mentioned my return to the EVE life, which I'd rate as a success thus far.  I left EVE University and joined a corp called Seppuku Warriors which is at least nominally a pvp training corp, though far training pretty much seems to consist of ""let's go here and kill this thing, learn from experience.""  Megan finished construction on my Abaddon battleship and I've been doing L4 missions ever since.  I've also obtained several other ships for pvp, including an Assault Frigate which is my new love, a Zealot Heavy Assault Cruiser, an Armageddon and Apocalypse class battleships, which are currently sitting unfit in my hanger in Amarr since I couldn't afford to replace the faction-modules that are apparently necessary for one of the fits.   I actually have quite a bit to write about in EVE but I want to give that it's own post.

I'm trying FFXI for the third time.  Already up to L21 warrior, as well as 18 Monk, 7 Black Mage, and 5 White mage.  They've done several things... well I would call it making leveling less painful rather than easier.  If the game's current format existed when the game released, I would be more sympathetic, I guess.  I'm still having enough fun to continue playing but if I have to spend half an hour standing around waiting for party very often, I doubt I'll keep playing for long.  Right now I'm planning on trying the Dark Knight, Paladin, and Samurai classes."

They discover he has no affiliation with House Cannith, but eventually decide to carry through the contract.  After saving Falian from bugbears, he takes them to Rose Quarry, where they unsuccessfully attempt to sneak into the town.  They fled the ruins of the quarry, after killing Kaela and one of the other guards.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>21 Nymm</b>: The party observes guards on patrol throughout the day.

Exploring the place, they befriend the awakened wolf pack and it&rsquo;s dire wolf leader, Rorsa.  They assist Rorsa in freeing the remaining wolves who have been trapped in a cages since the Mourning from a half-golem wolf.  After further exploration of the facility, they located two copies of the schema.  Garrow ambushed them, and demanded the schema.  Seth immediately handed over one of the schema that they&rsquo;d found.  Garrow left, taking their horses with him.  The party begins walking out of the Mournland, which occurs without incident other than a brief encounter with some air elementals.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>26 Nymm</b>: The party reaches Gorgonhold outside the Mournland and buys horses from a rather questionable middle aged human who works the stables.  They begin riding back to Rhuukan Draal.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>5 Lharvion</b>: The party reaches Rhuukan Draal.  Early in the morning about a day&rsquo;s walk from the city, they abandon their horses, having noticed two hobgoblin&rsquo;s in unknown uniforms shadowing them for the past several days.  Seth leaves about 20 gold in these horses saddlebags, suspecting that these hobgoblins are pursuing the horses.  The party rests in the Guardian&rsquo;s Gate Inn, the most secure inn in the city.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>6 Lharvion</b>: The party goes downstairs to find Elaydren d&rsquo;Cannith waiting for them.  She pays them for their work in retrieving the schema and offers to pay them an additional thousand each to escort her back to Sharn via the <i>Lightning on the Water</i>. Captain Vennet recognizes the party when they board, which they do immediately at Seth&rsquo;s insistence.  Seth also then sells the creation pattern that they discovered to Elaydren for another thousand gold a piece, as it&rsquo;s recovery wasn&rsquo;t part of their original contract.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>7 Lharvion</b>: The party members notice four black cloaked figures watching the <i>Lightning on the Water</i>, as it emerges from the river into the ocean, but they take no action.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>11 Lharvion</b>: The party arrives at Sharn without incident, and proceeds to accumulate a great deal of wealth through both their contracted payments from Elaydren and the sale of a great deal of equipment.

He seeks aid in divining a way to break the curse from the main body of the Lightbringers.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>20 Lharvion</b>: The party mostly relaxes and enjoys their newfound wealth while Seth works on items from his barracks spot in the Clifftop Adventurer&rsquo;s Guild hall.  Maximillian visits with Naz&rsquo;ghuul, his mentor about his return to his homeland of Cyre.  He learns from Naz&rsquo;ghuul the planned beast for the Festival of the Hunt this year is a Displacer Beast.  By the end of the day, Seth has finished up his item crafting.  <i>Whisper of the Vampire&rsquo;s Blade </i>begins.  Lucan Stellos, an elite agent of the Dark Lanterns, traces Calderus to her lair as he investigates her spy network, and is turned into a vampire.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>21 Lharvion</b>:  In the pre-dawn hours, Lucan Stellos breaks into one of the vaults of the Dark Lanterns under Calderus&rsquo;s orders to steal a magical longsword known as the <i>soul blade</i>.  He kills or incapacitates the guards, and flees the city with his sister on a carriage, heading for Trolanport.  Around ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, a House Orien courier arrives for Maximillian with a letter requesting his presence and that of his trusted friends.  The Dark Lanterns have taken note of their accomplishments in the Mournland and want to use proxy agents to recapture Lucan.  After an audition involving the defeat of a dire ape without killing it, they are given their mission details and sent after Lucian immediately.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>4 Barrakas</b>: Festival of the Hunt in Sharn.  The party catches up with Lucan Stellos and his sister in the evening, a little before sunset, and engage him.  They disable Lucan&rsquo;s carriage and he and his sister flee invisibly shortly before it crashes.  The party rides the rest of the night and reaches Trolamport.  Sarge spends the night roaming the city looking for information on what a &lsquo;krell&rsquo; mentioned in Lucan&rsquo;s notes might be, and finds little but sahguain muggers.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>5 Barrakas</b>: The party spreads out again seeking information on what a &lsquo;krell&rsquo; might be, and come up with the name &ldquo;Neya ir&rsquo;Krell&rdquo;, an Aundarian diplomat.  The party goes to the Aundarian embassy to speak with her, but are refused admittance.  Seth leaves her with a message about Lucan possibly being after her life.  Aware that she will be at the ball that evening, Maximillian goes to the House Orien enclave in the city and manages to pick up a date for the ball, thus securing for himself an invitation.  Caena attempts to find work as a servant, but Aundarians are not notorious for hiring Valenar elves as servants to high security, invitation-only, balls a few hours before they occur, especially when they show up with no references, in singed travel clothes with a battle mask on.  Meanwhile, Maximillian picks out an outfit for himself, in indigo blue with Cyran purple, and buttons that combine the crest of House Orien with the symbols of Cyre, and the whole thing with a great deal of silver trim.  He also had a blue and purple mask with a silver rim.  When Caena and Maximillian return to the inn to discuss plans with Seth and Sarge, a Orien courier arrives with a letter to Seth.  The letter indicates that Neya has received his message, and that she would be interested in discussing the matter at the ball tonight.  It also included four invitations.  Seth strongly opposed going, believing it to be a trap.  At the others insistence, he finally agrees to wait nearby the embassy with their adventuring equipment at ready, while the rest infiltrate the masquerade.  Caena obtains a red and gold outfit similar to the Valenar traditional garb, but with a more &lsquo;high society&rsquo; touch than an eye to efficient but glorious combat.  Sarge chooses to wear a dress, which makes him/her something of a sight, as warforged in frilly dresses are highly unusual.  The three of them spread out through the masquerade, Maximillian being pulled into a number of dances by his date, Kirian Orien.  After about twenty minutes, Maximillian manages to locate Neya and begins to speak with her, but in the midst of their conversation, Meena&rsquo;s attempt to <i>charm person</i> Lucan fails fairly miserably (as it doesn&rsquo;t work on undead), and he calls forth the <i>soul blade</i> from inside his glove of storing and nearly kills her in his initial attack.  The crowds panic, blocking clear shots for the gnome guards.  The two Aundairian agents with Meena attack, which results in the first of them being cut clean in two by a blow for Lucan, and the second, who was moving to protect Meena taking a fatal stomach wound.  His sister, Grilsha killed two of the Embassay guards with a scroll of <i>lightning bolt</i> in her attempt to both clear a escape route and to kill Neya, who she saw as betraying them.  Meena then attempted to entrap Lucan in a web, which he effortlessly evaded.  Seth made it inside, using <i>mage hand</i> to get Sarge&rsquo;s <i>heward&rsquo;s handy haversack</i> to him and attempted to use a <i>scorching ray </i>against Lucan.  Lucan again evaded the attack with ease, however, the ray ignited the webs, which began burning outwards, towards where Sarge, Maximillian, and many of the fleeing party guests were.  Maximillian managed to free himself to the degree that he was able to cast <i>create water</i> and douse the fire before it spread too far along the threads.  At this time, Lucan decided the odds were getting too far against him, and retreated towards the exit that Grilsha had cleared, and she used a scroll of <i>wall of ice</i> to block off their escape.  After Maximillian had been freed from the webs by Sarge, he healed the monk of his otherwise-fatal stomach wounds and patched up Meena.  After a few moments conversation, Meena had everyone clear the area around the <i>wall of ice</i> and used her <i>fireball</i> spell to break it down and set off in pursuit down the corridor.  The party learned from Neya that Lucan was headed for Karnath by way of an airship docked at the local Lyrander tower.  The made their way to the tower, and forced their way past the dominated gnome dockworkers, killing three of them in the process and leaving one to bleed to death.  Maximillian stabilized two that were bleeding to death before being pulled onboard the airship.  They paid their passage using the letter of credit given to them by Breland, and presented also their recommendation from Captain Vennet.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>6 Barrakas</b>: Having settled down on the airship in their two cabins, the party began to discuss ways to find Lucan and Grilsha.  Seth declared that he would be scribing scrolls in the morning, and not to disturb him.  The rest of the party went to check out the passengers.  They didn&rsquo;t find anyone suspicious, and eventually rested as well.  Seth awoke early and began working on scribing a scroll of <i>detect undead</i>.  The party spent most of the day on deck.  Once Seth completed the scroll, he attempted to use it to sweep the ship for Lucan, but because Lucan was in the dimensional locker, he did not detect his presence anywhere.  After this strategy failed, he used a scroll of <i>detect magic</i> and began sweeping the ship with that.  Using this strategy they located Grilsha and spoke with her.  After negotiation with her, she said she would inform her brother of their desire to meet and retired for the night.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>7 Barrakas</b>: The party spent the day in various preparations and enjoying the scenery.  That night, when they headed on deck to meet with Grilsha, she informed them that he had agreed to meet them in a few hours.  However, just as she told them this, they noticed another airship approaching from below, and several skiffs loaded with Emerald Claw boarders rising up.  Caena fired a scorching ray at the pilot of the lead skiff, and it crashed into the side of the <i>Cloud&rsquo;s Destiny</i>. The rest of the boarding party made it onto the deck, while archers fired from the safety of their skiffs.  The party engaged in fierce combat across the deck of the ship.  As the crew and Emerald claw casualties mounted, Sarge went below deck to search for Lucan.  As she was nearly to his locker, he emerged, killed the Emerald claw search team that had come below deck to look for him, and rose as mist to the deck of the ship.  The captain of the <i>Jade&rsquo;s Fire</i>, the Emerald Claw ship, fearing that he was about to escape, rammed the <i>Cloud&rsquo;s Destiny</i>.  As the ship approached, Seth ran below deck to warn Sarge.  The elementals of both ships broke free and engaged in combat.  Ironically, the <i>Cloud&rsquo;s Destiny </i>was powered by a fire elemental and the <i>Jade&rsquo;s fire </i>by a air elemental.  The combat between the two looked as if there was a tornado of fire engulfing the wreckage of the two ships as they plummeted from the sky.  Lucan assumed bat form and flew off, and Grilsha cast a spell to do the same.  Garrow, disguised as the captain of the <i>Jade&rsquo;s Fire, </i>drank of potion of <i>fly </i>in order to insure his escape.  Maximillian used his dragonmark to teleport onto the remaining skiff with the four surviving archers.  Caena had engulfed the ship in a choking smoke with fire spells and a cast of <i>pyrotechnics</i> earlier in the fight.  Maximillian appeared on the skiff just as the smoke cleared and began battling with the four archers for control of the ship.  Caena had obtained a potion of featherfall from one of the dead Emerald Claw soldiers and simply leaped off the side of the ship.  Belowdeck, Sarge and Seth had also obtained potions of featherfall from the dead soldiers, and were cutting their way out of the wreckage of the ship.  With the ship only a hundred feet above the ground, they broke free and lept through the firey tornado that was the elementals engaged in combat, and floated free of the wreckage.  Meanwhile, Maximillian had defeated two of the four archers, but was finally taken down.  The archers lowered the skiff and caught up to Caena, ordering him to surrender or they&rsquo;d kill his friend.  Caena complied and boarded the skiff.  As the skiff descended towards the wreckage to search for survivors, Sarge and Seth set up an ambush.  When the skiff landed, Sarge remained hidden, magically camouflaged by Seth&rsquo;s magic.  The ordered Seth to surrender, and Sarge burst from her hiding place and cut one of the archers down.  Caena slew the other one with a spell.  After healing Maximillian to consciousness, the party flew the wobbly skiff to Sterngate.  There, they reported what happened to the gate guard and ordered them to let them in the city, displaying their papers given to them by the Dark Lanterns.  They were let into the city, but the soldiers took the skiff to insepct it.  They obtained an inn room.  After discussion among the party members, they decided that the pursuit wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble for what they were getting paid.  They decided to return to Sharn on the morrow, and request either additional reinforcements or assistance.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>8 Barrakas</b>: After a night&rsquo;s rest at an inn, they returned to the makeshift impound at the local barracks, and found that the skiff would probably be impossible to repair.   Discussing methods of travel, Seth was inclined towards buying horses and riding the thousand or more miles back to Sharn, but Maximillian suggested taking the Lightning rail.  As a member of House Orien, and a dragonmarked heir of the House at that, he stated that he could get a discount.  Seth agreed to this, as long as it wasn&rsquo;t too expensive.  Maximillian went and spoke at length with the House Orien ticket master, and was able to secure for them extremely discounted prices.  The party boarded the train heading north to Starliskur and then west to Wroat and Sharn, unaware that Lucan and Grilsha were aboard the same train.  Around three in the afternoon (they boarded the train at twelve), they reached Starliskur, but only entered the town in order to purchase a few scrolls, then returned to the lightning rail.  As night began to fall, Caena and Maximillian visited the bar a car forward of the private cabin they had secured.  Seth and Sarge remained in the cabin, with the door locked, when a knock came.  Seth called out asking who it was, and received the reply &ldquo;Mr Stellos, here to see you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Seth called back.  &ldquo;I believe you requested a meeting with me&rdquo; was the answer.  Seth opened the door and two average farmer-type looking men walked in and sat down.  What was not immediately obvious was that the one doing the talking was not Lucan.  The other one, who stayed silent, was Lucan, and he spoke by dominating the other man and telepathically instructing him on what to say.  Seth and Lucan talked for a while, and Lucan explained (or rather stated in such a manner that Seth could make the assumptions) that he wasn&rsquo;t acting of his own will, but that of the sword.  Further, he hadn&rsquo;t acted in his own will in stealing the sword, but on the orders of another.  He could speak with Seth as long as he didn&rsquo;t consider him a threat to his arrival in Karnath, but if he saw him as a threat, he would have to kill him.  Seth asked Lucan if he would be willing to meet him again, and Lucan agreed, saying that he would contact him again.  Then both of them stood and left.  Seth and Sarge immediately went and informed Caena and Maximillian of what had just happened.  Caena and Seth then began investigating the train, finding it odd that two farmers could afford passage on the lightning rail.  They found a group of three farmers, and upon questioning, learned that there had been a forth, named Joe, who they hadn&rsquo;t seen in an hour.  After some back and forth questions of the passengers, they tracked Joe&rsquo;s last seen appearance to a cabin a car back from their own.  The door, however was locked.  Seth called over a conductor, and convinced him that he thought his friend Joe might be hurt, since he was in the cabin and not responding.  The conductor opened the door, and Joe was nowhere to be seen in the cabin.  The curtains were drawn, but otherwise it appeared to be an empty cabin.  Seth was apart to start a search of the compartments, but the conductor stopped him, finding him a bit suspicious.  Seth then went outside and used his <i>hand of the mage</i> to open the windows and the compartments from outside the train, as well as unlocking the door to the cabin from the inside.  Inside one of the compartments was an inky blackness that he couldn&rsquo;t see into.  What he did see, however, was bulky cloaked figures on horses riding up alongside the train, and Halflings on glidewings swooping out of the clouded night sky.  Shouting &ldquo;Raiders!&rdquo; he ran back inside the train.  He darted back into the cabin and searched the darkened area and found the cold corpse of Joe stuffed inside the compartment.  Lucan and Grilsha emerged from a forward car as the four discussed this.  Seth announced that he had a plan to free Lucian from the swords control.  Lucan was forced to act under his orders to stop anyone from interfering with his trip to Karnath and stabbed Seth, nearly fatally.  However, Seth stayed up and managed to cast <i>Protection from Evil</i> upon Lucan.  They quickly persuaded Lucan to allow himself to be staked.  Meanwhile, at the front of the train, the warforged raiders had boarded the train and killed the conductor for refusing to stop the train, which resulted in the loss of control of the elemental and was causing the lightning rail to begin an uncontrolled acceleration.  Maximillian, Seth, and Caena ran towards the front of the train, while Sarge and Grilsha fought the band of warforged raiders who had been slaughtering their way towards the middle cars from the rear who were led by a warforged named Scimitar.  Caena, Maximillian and Seth reached and engaged the warforged with only seconds to spare, and Seth and Caena were almost killed before Maximillian reached the <i>lightning reins</i> and was able to stop the lightning rail.  A lucky blast from Caena finished off Bastard, the leader of the warforged raiders.  With over half the passengers dead as well as the conductor, Maximillian piloted the lightning rail on the rest of it&rsquo;s trip to Wroat.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>9 Barrakas</b>: The lightning rail arrives in Wroat early in the day.  The party is questioned, and based primarily on Maximillian&rsquo;s party is not detained.  They transfer Lucan, hidden in a box, to another lightning rail, and head back to Sharn.  Arriving late that evening, they bring the box containing Lucan to the Dark Lanterns and receive their reward.   The party vows never to take a job like this one again.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>10 Barrakas</b>: Seth begins another crafting project, occupying him for several days, while the rest of the party simply enjoys the relaxation in Sharn.  Maximillian reports to Naz&rsquo;ghuul about the events of his mission.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>14 Barrakas</b>: After finishing his crafting work, the party begins looking for work again and finds a posting requesting skilled adventurers.  No name is signed to the posting, but an address of inquiry leads them to the Medusa&rsquo;s Kiss.  As it turns out, it is indeed Demisi.  She wishes them to seek out an ancient hobgoblin mask that is buried somewhere under the sewers.  She provides directions to the sewer hatches, then sends the party on their way.  The party descends into the sewers, and quickly finds themselves being stalked by kobolds.  They &lsquo;ambush&rsquo; the kobolds, capturing one named Yipyap.  They enlist his help for a couple of silver coins, upon which he proceeds to ride on Sarge&rsquo;s head.  After some brief encounters with sewer monsters, they find a hatch leading down further under the city into the lava pools.  Once in the caverns of the lava pools they managed to locate the ruins described by Demisi.  They fought their way through the ruins and located the mask, only to find a small clutch of wrymling red dragons.  They barely defeated the dragons, and retrieved the mask, as well as located the dragons horde, which composed mostly of a huge mass of copper coins.  They decided to leave the copper there, taking only the silver, gold and platinum coins.  As the party departed the ruins, they encountered an Empty vessel half dragon Inspired.  She attacked the party, but was slain.  On emerging back to the sewers, they directed Yipyap to bring his kobold friends and gifted them with the mass of copper coins they had left in the ruins.  The kobolds enthusiastically rushed into the lava pools shouting with glee.  Upon their return to the Medusa&rsquo;s Kiss, they handed the mask over to Demisi, and she paid them as agreed.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>15 Barrakas</b>: Maximillian wakes up to find his dragonmark to have grown to cover most of his face.  Seth grows tired of living in a curtained off area of the Clifftop adventurer&rsquo;s hall barracks, and he and Sarge go real-estate hunting.  They meet with a real-estate agent, who agrees to take them to lunch the next day when the rest of the party can attend.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>16 Barrakas</b>: The real estate agent treated the party to a meal at Sannid&rsquo;s in the Platinum Heights of Upper Central.  After the meal, he showed the party to the house, which was in the Highwater district of Upper Dura.  It had a living room, a pantry with a cooking pit, a study room, two bedrooms, and a bathroom.  The four of them, finding it to their satisfaction, agreed to purchase it, and moved there from Clifftop the same day.  Seth immediately went back to work crafting magical items.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>27 Barrakas</b>:  A gargoyle courier arrived from Lady Eladrin d&rsquo;Cannith, requesting the parties urgent help, and for them to meet her at her house.  When the party arrived, she was under attack by Karnathi zombies, which they put a rapid end to.  Eladrin told them that the Emerald Claw had attacked her at her own house and stolen the schema&rsquo;s and the creation pattern that they had recovered previously, as well a great deal of her notes on the location of the fourth schema.  She begged them to quickly locate the fourth schema before the Emerald Claw gained it and completed the pattern.  After some debate, the party accepted the task, primarily on the grounds that they didn&rsquo;t want the Emerald Claw to have the pattern, but insisted on it&rsquo;s destruction upon recovery.  Eladrin hedged, avoiding answering that demand directly, and quickly gave them money for supplies.  Unbeknownst to both the party and Eladrin, Merrix d&rsquo;Cannith, Eladrin&rsquo;s true employer, was observing events at the household all along, and intentionally had allowed the location of the schema to slip to the Emerald Claw.  His plan is to let the Emerald Claw locate and retrieve the fourth schema, and then recover the completed pattern.  She also sent them to meet with a gnome named Byam, the captain of an undersea ship (Submarine).  They purchased supplies and headed down to the docks to meet him.  He and his crew showed the party into a warehouse with a hollowed out bottom where the ship rested.  Once the crew and party had embarked, Captain Byam set out towards Xen&rsquo;drik where the fourth schema waited.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>28 Barrakas</b>: Sarge remained huddled midship away from the viewing room, playing cards with Seth.  Caena and particularly Maximillian enjoyed the view from the viewing bubble as they moved through the Saigon&rsquo;s teeth, taking a shortcut on their route to Xen&rsquo;drik.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>1 Rhaan</b>: The submarine was attacked by a dire shark and it&rsquo;s sahuagin handlers.  The submarine quickly rises to the surface, but it caught in the nets of the sahuagin.  The crew, Maximillian, and Caena emerge into the water with potions of <i>water breathing</i> in order to cut the nets.  The dire shark eats the four gnomes who emerged to help cut the nets before Caena and Maximillian finish cutting the <i>Sea Dart </i>free.  Caena creates a ring of blades around himself, which doesn&rsquo;t stop the dire shark from swallowing him whole.  Maximillian swims into the dire shark&rsquo;s mouth after him, and uses his newly strengthened dragonmark to teleport himself and Caena back inside the ship.  He manages to heal Caena enough to keep him from dying despite the whirling blades keeping everyone back from the Valenar elf.  The ship rises to the surface, and Byam, the two surviving gnome crewmen, and the party defeat the sahuagin handlers, and, after making repairs, continue onto Xen&rsquo;drik.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>2 Rhaan</b>: In the late afternoon, the <i>Sea Dart </i>arrives about a mile away from Stormreach.  Byam tells the adventurers that he will wait for them for 30 days, then leave.  The party makes it to Stormreach without incident and goes to the local House Cannith enclave to seek assistance in garnering transportation to make it to the ruins, which lay deeper into the jungles.  There are two gnome secretaries, who display complete apathy to pretty much everything the party does, and the head of the local enclave, Miran d&rsquo;Cannith.  Miran is obstinate, barely displaying any concern with the parties mission.  They manage to wrangle a letter of credit out of him for a riverboat to get to the ruins, but in the end, after they have the letter, they practically storm out of the room, knocking aside Miran&rsquo;s pet project on the way, several floating geometric spheres.  The party goes to the docks, and finds the riverboat mentioned in the letter of credit, a captain Chinxero&rsquo;s boat, called the <i>Marlow</i>.  Chinxero is reluctant to take the payment in the letter, citing his lack of trust that Miran will honor it.  The party is sympathetic, and leaves.  They then go to the House Orien enclave, and tell the local head, Banthen d&rsquo;Orien, all about the schema, the patterns, and their mission.  Banthen is quite pleased with the party, and the potential to gain an opportunity to blackmail House Cannith.  He promises to provide them with at least one-way transportation to the vicinity of the ruins, via the next greater heir of Passage that becomes available.  He anticipates that this should be no longer than three of four days.  The party cheerfully agrees, and goes to find an inn.  Once they get to an inn, however, they find an elven woman named Muroni waiting for them.  She tells them it was destiny that they would meet here, and asks to accompany them and watch them.  Seth adamantly refuses, though the rest of the party is receptive.  She buys them inn rooms, which everyone but Seth (and therefore Sarge) accept.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>6 Rhaan</b>: The party attempts to teleport based on a vague description and a general &ldquo;here&rdquo; on the map.  Appearing in the middle of the jungle, they decide to try again using the river as a landmark.  The second attempt places them at the river successfully.  The Orien heir stays with the party having expended his teleportation uses for the day.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>7 Rhaan</b>: The party reaches the temple, and the Orien heir returns to the enclave.  The party enters the temple and kills numerous Emerald Claw soldiers.  However, after a long forgotten trap left by the giants kills Seth, the rest of the party is eventually overwhelmed and perish.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>25 Rhaan</b>: The Lightbringer sages uncover mention of the Curse of the Decaying Raven in a truly ancient tome regarding the lands of Barovia in northern Karnath.  The place was of little strategic importance and was able to remain untouched by the Last War.  Attempts to recruit from the region were met with failure, no recruiting parties returned.  Suspecting that Paladin Alexander, now in an advanced state of the wasting curse might need assistance, begins to prepare to dispatch forces to Barovia.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>3 Sypheros</b>: High Priest Renauld Flameborn, a well respected asamir priest in central Thrane is called to the Lightbringers headquarters in Flamekeep.  He is told of the Paladin Alexander&rsquo;s curse and his help is requested in breaking it.  At the same time, three paladins including Ashlyn Forini are dispatched as an advance force to Barovia.  High Priest Renauld sets out to the Lightbringers well concealed base in Karnath to meet up with Alexander.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>17 Sypheros</b>: The Lightbringers advance force arrives in Barovia.  They learn that the region is ruled by Strahd, and other powerful creatures of the night.  However, when they attempt to leave, the road becomes choked with mist and they are unable to find their way out.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>24 Sypheros</b>: Danovich&rsquo;s son, Doru, is killed by werewolves.  Danovich goes mad with grief, and begins to study the <i>Liber Blaspheme</i> which he had uncovered many years ago.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>3 Aryth</b>: Danovich raises his son Doru as a blaspheme.  This act of evil irrevocably taints the priest with the corruption of the <i>Liber</i> and creates the beginning of the zombie plague.  Strahd kills the burgomaster of Barovia, Kolyan, for &lsquo;interfering with his plans.&rsquo;  His grief stricken daughter Illyena mourns his passing, and lays his body in state in their home.  His son, Ismark, becomes the nominal burgomaster in his father&rsquo;s steed.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>4 Aryth</b>: The plague spreads throughout the town.  Near the church where Doru, now a blaspheme, hunts casualties are high, but the three paladins manage to contain most of the zombies, evacuating as many of the townspeople as they can find to the center of town and building barricades.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>14 Aryth</b>: High Priest Renauld arrives at the Lightbringer stronghold in Karnath, and meets with Paladin Alexander, and Lars Ostren.  The three travel in secret towards the borders of Barovia, as an Aundarian, a Flamite priest, and a Karnathian paladin together might attract unwanted attention.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>18 Aryth</b>: Lorsanna d&rsquo;Medani, a least marked member of her house, receives a dream compelling her to travel to Barovia.  She sees the faces of Alexander, Renauld, and Lars and feels compelled to help them.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>19 Aryth</b>: Lassar is given an assignment from a contact in the Karnathi military to investigate disappearances of multiple &lsquo;recruiting&rsquo; squads in the region of Barovia and sets out from Atur.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>24 Aryth</b>: In the village of Barovia, Ashlyn&rsquo;s companions, Thendrick and Mathilda grow tired of just waiting for help to arrive, and attempt to strike at the heart of the infection in the church.

They stop there for night, planning to ride on to the village of Barovia in the morning.  While they are sitting at a table in the common room, discussing their strategies and pasts, a Vistani walks in and leaves them a letter from the burgomaster of Barovia, pleading with their help against &lsquo;the howls of wolves.&rsquo;</p></meta></meta>"

	</style> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">1 <b>Vulk</b>: The party arrives in the Barovian valley.  The area is completely choked in mist.  When they pass through the gate, it slams shut behind them, with a rather loud screeching sound.  They arrive in an apparently deserted Barovia, and shortly encounter the zombies and their necromantic infection.  They fight their way through the center of town, rescuing two children, one of which had been bitten on their way in.  They arrive in time to save Ashlyn who was fighting to keep the undead who had broken through the barricades from reaching the inn where most of the townspeople are holed up.  Exhausted from fighting their way through so many zombies, they spent the night in the inn, planning to assault the church in the morning.  Inside they encountered Ismark in a intoxicated state and the Arenal elf, Demisi, who was seeking the <i>Tome of Strahd</i>.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Meanwhile, on the continent of Xen&rsquo;drik, a catfolk named Kit&rsquo;arhia is dispatched by her tribe to investigate a disturbing force felt in the ancient Temple of the Claw a few days away.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>2 Vulk</b>:  The party fights their way through the heaviest part of the plagued area to reach the church.  Inside they easily defeat the crazed Danovich and find his journal, tainted with his madness, and descend below to slay Doru.  After destroying the blaspheme, they find the recently de-animated bodies of Thendrick and Mathilda.  With Doru&rsquo;s death, the zombies fall dead (again), and the other undead withdraw from the city.  The town celebrates, somewhat somberly, and the remaining survivors are found, numbering around two hundred in total from the villages original thousand or so inhabitants.  The remainder of the day is largely spent gathering and burning the bodies of the dead outside of town.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Kit&rsquo;arhia encounters first a drow hunting party which warns her away from their territory and later Aleko Kilvari, who has been wandering lost in the savannahs of central Xen&rsquo;drik for some time after his expedition suffered a series of unfortunate events.  They continue towards the Temple of the Claw.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>3 Vulk</b>: After a night spent handling the corpses of the dead, the party decides to follow the leads they heard in town regarding the Vistani woman, Madame Eva.  On their way there, they assist Sir Ulrick in battling against some murks at the northern crossroad of Barovia, and he offers to accompany and assist them.  When the party arrives at the Vistani camp, they are welcomed to Madame Eva&rsquo;s tent, being told that they were expected, though Sir Ulrick must wait outside.  Inside, she gave them the fortunes of Ravenloft, telling them of the Sunsword, the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, and the Tome of Strahd.  The fortunes also told them where they might find these objects and where to restore their power.  The Sunsword was to be found where &ldquo;order meets chaos&rdquo; and could be restored in a &ldquo;place of supplication.&rdquo;  When they discussed the clues with Sir Ulrick, he suggested that they search the cemetery on the south edge of the village.  Following this suggestion, the party returned to town.  On their way back, they were assaulted by a raging vampire in broad daylight, calling himself Kavan the Grim.  He attacked madly without concern for his own safety, wounding Renauld before Alexander and Ulrick drove their blades into him.  Though initially unable to locate the sword&rsquo;s hiding place, when they assisted Illyena in burying her father, they found buried under the cemetery a stone structure.  They spent the rest of the day excavating the crypt.  Once they managed to get inside, Alexander was able to retrieve the blade of the Sunsword from the corpse that held it within the crypt.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">On Xen&rsquo;drik, as Aleko and Kit&rsquo;arhia traveled, a fiendish tiger named Rezzish attacked them.  Aleko was nearly torn apart by the tiger before Kit&rsquo;arhia drove him off.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Later that night, the quiet was interrupted by the howls of wolves, as the local werewolf pack attacked the town.  Some of the villagers were simply killed by the wolves, whereas others were intentionally bitten and left to the following nights.  The party managed to kill two of the werewolves, but all in all some thirty people were killed and another twenty were bitten, including seven children.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">On Xen&rsquo;drik, Kit&rsquo;arhia and Aleko arrive at the Temple of the Claw, and realize they had forgotten torches with which to explore the ancient temple, which was completely unlit.  They made makeshift torches instead from local tree branches.  Once they had the makeshift torches ready, they began exploring the temple.  Inside, they encountered two dolghasts, but dispatched them easily enough.  Following clues they found inside, they made their way through a long trapped hallway, and came into the main chamber of the temple.  There they found a dolgaunt muttering angrily to himself in the language of Xoriat.  Upon spotting them, he launched into an attack, but was slain by the two of them.  They searched the main chamber and located some treasure sealed inside a secret passage, and then headed back towards the catfolk encampment.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>4 Vulk</b>: The party sets out in search of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.  They were ambushed by three werewolves on the road to swamp.  Lorsanna and Lars killed two of them and the third fled.  However, Lars had become infected by the werewolf&rsquo;s bite.  Continuing through the woods they reached the Ivalis marsh.  As they made their way through the bog, a bloodmote swarm moved in a buzzing cloud towards them from across a river.  However, recognizing the undead nature of the swarm, Lorsanna, Alexander, and Renauld unleashed a blast of positive energy to turn them back, and the swarm fled back into the swamp, but a moment later a shambling mound burst from beneath the water and attempted to strangle Alexander to death in it&rsquo;s vines.  Alexander fortunately freed himself and the shambling mound shortly perished.  They used flying magic on Alexander&rsquo;s horse in order to cross the river without further incident.  Up ahead, they spotted the ruins of the swamp fane.  As they approached, the Drowned Lady shambled forth, attempting to use her eye against first Alexander, then Ulrick, and finally Lorsanna, but found no fear in any of their hearts., and was thus unable to use her Evil Eye.  Once they had dealt with a local pack of blood eels (large leach like creatures) and the Drowned Lady, they were able to inspect the Swamp Fane.  They sensed the latent natural energy concentrated in the fane, but were more interested in the box they found at the base of the fane.  Lars used his magic to open the box and inside lay the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.  As it was late in the afternoon by this time, they decided to rest there at the center of the swamp rather than risk traveling back to town in the dark through the swamp.  Ulrick, however, fearing for the safety of the town decided to return on his own.  Again, Lars called upon his magic and created a <i>Leomund&rsquo;s Secure Shelter</i>.  Inside they waited for nightfall, preparing to break Lars lycanthropic curse.  However, back at the village, Thirteen of the twenty villagers who had been bitten also transformed into wolves.  While Renauld and Lorsanna were able to break Lars of his curse, it was all Ashlyn and Ulrick could do to contain the bitten townsfolk.  Seven of them escaped into the wood, while Ulrick and Ashlyn held back the children who had transformed.  The party remained in their shelter until shortly before dawn of the next day.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>5 Vulk</b>:  Around seven in the morning, Raphail, one of the vampire servants of Strahd coalesced out of the mists in the center of Barovia.  He promptly used his domination power on a nearby child and had him bring other children to him, dominating five before Ashlyn and Ulrick awoke, detecting the presence of evil, and came forth to confront him.  By using the children as a shield, Raphail defeated both of them, slaying Ashlyn and leaving Ulrick unconscious on the ground, barely alive.  He then ordered the children to watch the edge of town and gave them special greeting instructions for Paladin Alexander and High Priest Renauld.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As the party approached the town, the children ran out to greet them, delivering the message as they&rsquo;d been instructed.  &ldquo;High priest Renauld! Sir Alexander! There&rsquo;s a man in black armor waiting for you in the center of town, and he says you have to die!&rdquo; and then launching themselves at the two.  Lorsanna simply placed them into a deep slumber as they lept forward and they left the children slumbering peacefully as the party galloped towards the center of town.  On their arrival, they saw Raphail sitting on the fountain, with Ashlyn and Ulrick lying at his feet.  He stood and delivered the following speech &ldquo;Ah, hello there.  I&rsquo;m glad you made it alright.  I sent out some children to greet you, but they seem to have fallen asleep on the job.  So hard to get good help around here, especially when paladins are attacking you without the slightest provocation.  Here I was, trying to employ some local children and they drew their swords and attacked me, all full of righteousness.  Anyway, I&rsquo;m here to deliver a message.&rdquo; And at this, his demeanor changed, becoming deadly serious.  &ldquo;High priest Renauld!  You are hereby ordered by Strahd, Lord of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft, to appear before his gates alone this night!  Should you fail to come alone or fail to come at all, the lives of everyone in this village shall be forfeit!&rdquo; and with this pronouncement dissolved back into the mists of Ravenloft.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Renauld, seeing no other choice to protect the people, decided to comply.  As evening approached, he walked north along the road to the Castle Ravenloft.  The bridge stood open when he arrived, and the doors to the keep the same.  Once inside, he was greeted by Raphail, who led him to the banquet hall, where Strahd waited.   Renauld refused to eat or drink any of the food or wine that Strahd offered him, and he and Strahd conversed for some time.  Strahd made him an offer, that if he and his companions could solve the werewolf problem, by whatever means, he would allow the village to continue living in peace.  Renauld responded that he would accept the offer, but warned Strahd that he might well be back to destroy Strahd himself.  Strahd shrugged, seeming unconcerned, and told Renauld that he might find that Strahd was a better lord than many of the mortal variety.  They debated the merits back and forth, until eventually after some time had passed, Strahd said they he had others matters of his domain to attend to, and had a half-celestial escort Renauld out.  Renauld spoke with the half-celestial about Strahd as they walked, and was somewhat concerned by the attitude of the half-celestial towards Strahd.  However, he returned to the village.  When he returned, the rest of the party intensely inspected him for magical compulsion or perhaps him being an undead in disguise.  Finding none of these things, they asked him what had happened and he relayed his story, saying that Strahd was the &ldquo;worst kind of evil, the kind that hides behind the thin veneer of nobility.&rdquo;  They then began discussing what to do next.  They buried Ashlyn in the south cemetery of town, and then decided to go to the Vistani and to obtain the platinum hilt they would need to re-empower the Sunsword.  Renauld decided to stay in town with Ulrick and defend the village against further incursion or assault.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">On Xen&rsquo;drik, Kit&rsquo;arhia and Aleko arrived back at Kit&rsquo;arhia&rsquo;s tribal encampment.  They spoke with the Eldest, the druid leader of her tribe.  After relating the tale, the Eldest decided to have Kit&rsquo;arhia escort Aleko the three hundred miles to Stormreach.  After gathering some basic supplies (both Aleko and Kit&rsquo;arhia have <i>rings of sustenance</i> which allow them to travel without food or water), they set out north across the savannah towards the jungle.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">When they arrived at the Vistani encampment, Alexander went to speak to Madame Eva.  He told her of his need for a platinum hilt to reforge the sword, and that he did not have the money to pay for it.  She offered a favor for a favor.  If they could find out the source of and put a stop to the disappearance of some of her Vistani up north by Tser falls.  Around this time, Lassius arrived in the town of Barovia and began asking questions of what townspeople he could find.  Other than Renauld, he found few willing to talk to him, with recent events making the villagers extremely suspicious of outsiders other than the party.  At Tser Falls, the party encountered a pack of wolves and numerous traps.  As the wolves fell back under their assault, they followed them into an unlit cave behind the falls.  From the cliffs above, a pack of ghouls and ghasts observed the party from the cover of the mists.  Inside, Varkov the trapper waited and ambushed them, firing his crossbow from the cover of darkness.  Lars summoned forth a lantern archon and battle was joined.  In the end, it was Alexander, charging over the area of a <i>grease </i>spell, sliding down a hill, and running Varkov through as he fell that won the day.  The remaining wolves and worgs went berserk and were slain by the party.  They explored the rest of the cave, finding several stuffed humans, a stuffed bear, and a fake stuffed werewolf in hybrid form.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Lassius, finding little in the way of answers in town, headed north to the Vistani encampment.  The party arrived back at the camp around the same time as he arrived there.  While Alexander went to report to Madame Eva, and receive the platinum hilt for the Sunsword, the rest of the party talked with Lassius, who asked them numerous questions about the region, finding them much more informative.  Once he had gotten the answers to his questions, he tried to use a <i>sending coin</i> to report back to his &lsquo;home office&rsquo; in Karnath, but found the magical communication out of the valley blocked.  This was puzzling to him, so he accompanied the party back to the village of Barovia.  The party spotted the ghouls as they traveled and were about to attack them, when the ghouls reminded the party of their pack with Strahd.  At the edge of the village, the ghouls disappear into the mists.  Ashlyn&rsquo;s body, infused with negative energy from Raphail&rsquo;s attack digs it&rsquo;s way up out of the ground in which it is buried.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>6 Vulk, midnight</b>: Alexander, Lars, and Lorsanna meet with Renauld to report on their success in the Blood on the Vine inn in the middle of town.  Renauld gets Ismark to tell Lassius about the events leading up to their arrival, and the party discovers Strahd&rsquo;s obsession with his sister, Illyena.  On the edge of town, the first living person the newly risen Ashlyn encounters is Demisi, who easily seizes control of the newly risen spawn.  Somewhat irritated by the disruption, Demisi heads towards the Blood on the Vine to taunt the party about their companion&rsquo;s state.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>6 Vulk, day</b>:  Lassius spent the morning trying to interview Demisi, which did not go terribly well, but nor did it get him attacked.  Then the party set out towards the woods to hunt the remaining werewolves.  Soon after they departed, rain began to pour from the sky.  Alexander stayed behind with Renault in town, guarding the town.  The party encountered a werewolf ambush, but slaughtered the attacking wolves.  Continuing through the woods, the werewolves and their corrupted nymph leader were waiting for the party at the cave that served as their home.  After a fierce battle, the werewolf pack was slaughtered and their nymph leader slain.  Strahd witnessed this through his <i>scyring</i> spell.  In a fit of rage at having his plans ruined, he headed towards the village of Barovia, with Kavan, Rafail, and Sasha in tow.  The entire village became choked with mist as the vampires approached.  Alexander and Renauld were sitting in the tavern when they heard a crash and stone shattering outside.  Alexander ran outside to investigate, wandering through the mist till he found a wooden stake sticking up through the stone.  Suddenly screams began to resound throughout the mist as vampires began pulling people from their homes and killing them, targeting anyone who had helped the party.  Rafail manifested ontop of Alexander&rsquo;s horse and the two fought.  Rafail had difficulty passing Alexander&rsquo;s imbued shield, but nor could Alexander injure Rafail.  However, with one of the major targets located, Sasha closed in on him, bombarding him with magic against which Alexander had no defense.  Renauld used his magic to keep them at bay for a moment and yelled for Alexander to flee.  Rafail turned his attention to the priest and bore him to the ground.  Alexander stayed a moment longer, but as Kavan emerged from the mist, he realized he stood no chance at all against their combined might and retreated towards the Vistani camp.  Demisi fled into the woods, having the vampiric Ashlyn and her skeletal butler, Alfred cover her as she fell back to what she felt was a safer location.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The party returned to town an hour later, covered in water and victory, to find the town dead quiet.  They rode to the center of town and found the bodies of the townsfolk.  The rest of the day was spent digging graves and investigating.  The twenty or so survivors of the town refused to emerge or speak with them.  Around nightfall Alexander returned from the camp, and told the rest of the party what had happened.  After re-fortifying the Blood on the Vine, they bunkered down for the night.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>7 Vulk</b>:  The party gathered their strength and marched off towards Castle Ravenloft.  As they approached the drawbridge the rain slowed to a slight drizzle, and they noticed green slime dripping from the archway behind the portcullis.  By using Lars conjured mount as a shield they were able to pass under it unharmed.  Entering the castle, they passed two stone dragons which suddenly sprang to life, spraying the party with fire.  Their battle carried them into the next room where gargoyles swept from the alcoves of the room to strafe the party.  The party slew the two stone dragons and, when the gargoyles proved unable to effectively damage the party, they retreated.  The party spread out, exploring the entrance hall, and coming across a door leading to a banquet hall.  Inside was Strahd, who turned and greeted them with expectation.  He explained what his plan regarding the werewolves had been, and how they had played their part of an outside threat a little too well, annihilating the allies that Strahd had intended to drive to his doorstep.  For ruining his plans, he promised the party a painful death.  During the course of the conversation, he managed to seize control of Lassius&rsquo;s mind with his <i>dominate </i>ability.  However, he did not make use of this immediately.  At the end of the conversation, he converted to mist form and flowed up through the ceiling, but then merely made his way over to the chapel, expecting they would soon arrive.   Once the party located the chapel, they began attempting to setup a defense perimeter.  However, once Strahd&rsquo;s assault began the perimeter only trapped them in as they fought desperately for their lives.  They drove off Strahd once, but a few hours later, he returned at full strength and began assaulting them with magic, using his link to Lassius to locate the party. As the party&rsquo;s spells ran low, Alexander made a desperate strike, charging his horse up the balcony and leaping into the air to strike a blow against Strahd to force him back to his coffin.  During the battle, Strahd err&rsquo;d and ordered Lassius to use his <i>dispel magic </i>without excluding himself from the area, allowing him to break the dominate.  They then withdraw back to the cave where they had fought Varkov the Trapper to rest and regain their strength.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>8 Vulk</b>: As the party rested in the cave, they came under attack from Rafail and four vampire spawn.  However, they easily drove them off.  The party then decided to try a different approach to entering the castle, going up the sides of the walls with <i>spider climb </i>magic.  After selecting a tower for ascent, they reached the top and discovered a strange and twisted garden, and its gardener, the barbed devil, Khyristirix.  After an intense battle in which both Alexander and Lorsanna were nearly slain, they slew Khyristirix and two of her three warlock servants.  The most powerful of the three, Trina, escaped however, via <i>flee the scene</i>.    The party found the <i>hellheart locket </i>on Khyristirix&rsquo;s body.  The party was however grievously wounded, and withdrew to the deep northern forests of Barovia.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>9 Vulk</b>:  The party returned to the castle, sneaking in via Lassius&rsquo;s <i>invisibility sphere </i>spell.  They began wandering the castle, exploring through various rooms in the first and second floor.  Eventually they passed through the throne room and back down through the first floor and then up the staircase until the reached the Dayheart landing.  Rafail and the vampire spawn assigned to guard it immediately engaged them.  Strahd himself arrived a few rounds later to defend his artifact which a great deal of his power had been invested in.  Lorsanna was able to turn Rafail and the other lesser vampires, forcing them to flee, but Strahd remained, tearing and slashing at them in his feral form.  The battle raged all across the landing, but the party managed to drive Strahd back with seconds left before Rafail and the vampire spawn returned.  The party retreated at full speed down the stairs.  All the vampires left from the top of the landing down towards the party, reverting to mist at the bottom to avoid the impact, but Lorsanna released another pulse of positive energy, destroying the four spawn.  Rafail endured the attack and pursued the party through the halls for a few moments more before Lorsanna&rsquo;s third pulse pushed him back again.  He yelled the command word for the drawbridge to shut, but Lars blasted the chains apart and causing the drawbridge to come crashing down.  The party retreated down the mountain, followed in the air by Rafail in his bat form.  However, once they reached the river, he had to turn south to follow the long way as he could not cross running water.  The party retreated again into the forest.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Meanwhile, Demisi had returned to the village, and ordered Ashlyn to kill some of the villagers and turn them into vampire spawn under her (and therefore, Demisi&rsquo;s) command.  This, Demisi planned, would give her a reasonably strong expendable force.  Further, as Strahd&rsquo;s wards around Barovia were attuned to the living and not the dead, it allowed her to use the expendable spawn as messengers to her superiors in the Blood of Vol, and request reinforcements.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>10 Vulk</b>: Lars developed a plan of attack for assaulting the Dayheart.  The party rode up to the entrance to the castle in the morning, and Lassius climbed up the side walls up to where the devil&rsquo;s garden was via his <i>spider climb</i> while invisible.  The rest of the party was <i>teleported</i> by Lars to the garden, and they crossed the catwalk to the Dayheart landing.  Strahd and Rafail were there waiting for them, however, and the party was driven back almost immediately and forced to retreat by Lars&rsquo; <i>teleport</i>.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>11 Vulk: </b>The party essentially attempted the same strategy again, this time however, preparing defensive magic and protections in advance.  This time, they had Lassius stay back at the camp, casting dispel magic on the <i>hellheart locket</i>, which suppressed the defensive enhancements that the Devil&rsquo;s Garden provided.  The party then began unloading on the Dayheart.  Lars unleashed blasts of corrosive acid at it, and Lorsanna called down pillars of flame.  Strahd unleashed his own power, raining poisons, lightning, and fire, all charged with negative energy against the party.  Ulrick and Alexander both took a considerable beating, but the continual assault of magic against the Dayheart eventually shattered it.  Rafail and Strahd retreated.  In the meantime, Lassius had run out of <i>dispel magic </i>casts and decided to simply smash the locket, which summoned a bearded devil named Divrix.  It offered him a Faustian pact, and he bargained for a time, but not wanting to be caught bargaining with a devil when the rest of the party returned, he asked to defer the bargaining until a later date.  Moments later, the party returned via <i>teleport </i>once more.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>12 Vulk</b>:   The party returned again to the castle to explore, this time descending down into the depths below the castle.  However, a trap split Alexander and Ulrick from the rest of the party, as two giant ants and an invisible troll stalker attacked.  However, Lorsanna simply lay the stalker to sleep with <i>deep slumber</i>.  Alexander and Ulrick wandered about the upper floors where the trap had taken them, but eventually wandered down into a nest of demons.  They barely survived the encounter, but realized they had certainly taken a wrong turn, and headed back upstairs to look for a different route.  In the meantime, the rest of the group had made their way back up to the second floor of the castle.  They entered a dining room, and opened a window, letting in the dim light of the overcast sky, and then proceeded to open the door to a study, in which stood Strahd.  His presence ordained by the Fortunes of Ravenloft, he stood his ground, again throwing his magic against the party&rsquo;s.  Lars, Lorsanna, and Lassius had been growing stronger, however, but it still seemed a near even battle, until finally Alexander and Ulrick managed to surround him and finally he was forced into mist form.  They spread out and searched through the study, and found numerous magical tomes and books of theory, some quite ancient and rare, and a copy of Strahd&rsquo;s spellbook.  Lassius found a secret passage in the fireplace, though Alexander set off a trap in his eagerness to open it.  Inside was a chest, and another secret passage.  Moving down this new passage, the party was engaged by two human sized spiders.  They slew them and continued down the passage.  At the end, concealed behind another secret passage was the true treasury, and the Tome of Strahd.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">After summoning a celestial monkey to set off any traps on it, they retrieved the tome and withdrew from the castle.  Lars began studying the tome.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Meanwhile, Demisi, realizing they have obtained the tome, sets out to find the party and make a deal to obtain it.  She posts undead birds near numerous major landmarks with orders to alert her if they spot the party and sets up in town to wait.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>13 Vulk: </b>After revealing what he had learned in the Tome of Strahd to the party, Lars formulated their plan of assault on the three fanes.  Initially they considered a feint operation, but discarded the plan when they realized that the person performing the feint would almost certainly be killed.  The plan eventually decided upon was to go first to the Swamp fane, and have Lars perform the Ritual of Transference there.  However, that night, as they rested, the sky turned black, and a vortex of black clouds engulfed Castle Ravenloft.  The negative energy which had been building in the body of Ireena had reached critical mass and she arose as Strahd&rsquo;s new vampire bride.  He was over-joyed at the success, and set about reconstructing her personality to more closely match his own twisted version of Tatiyana&rsquo;s.  The negative energy left a physical manifestation of taint, which poured down the side of the cliffs and filled the basin at the bottom.  The party watched, disturbed.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>14 Vulk</b>: The sky&rsquo;s remained black all day, and the liquid evil in the basin continued to rise.  The party spent all day observing this phenomenon.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">A skeletal Pegasus, still capable of flight, and instructions detailing her priorities are the only response Demisi receives.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In Xen&rsquo;drik, Aleko and Kit&rsquo;arhia arrive in Stormreach mostly intact, and begin trading some of the items they found for cash and seeking a place to stay.  Kit&rsquo;arhia has the gem she found in the Temple of the Claw made into a piece of jewelry, and smashes a rather rude gnome through the side of his own stall.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>15 Vulk: </b>The skies returned to their normal gray color, and the party sets out for the swamp.  Once they arrive at the Swamp Fane, Lassius erects an illusion to conceal them, and Lars begins the Ritual of Transference. As he did so, the entire swamp seemed to come alive, with a sort of revitalizing force, as the links between Strahd and the land began to break.  Demisi&rsquo;s undead scouts observed this, and reported back to her.  She gathered a few vampire spawn together, and placed a <i>disguise undead </i>spell on Alfred, making him appear to be a normal human skeleton instead of a boneclaw.  She then approached the fane, and called out to the party.  Alexander emerged from the cover of the illusion to negotiate with her, then returned under the cover of it to discuss with the rest of the party.  Eventually, he and Ulrick agreed they could not cooperate with evil, and the two Paladins charged out of the illusion at Demisi.  Alfred burst into his true form, nearly impaling Alexander as Ashlyn moved to block Ulrick.  The Knight of the Raven and the former Lightbringer&rsquo;s swords twirled back in forth in an eerie mirror of eachother, as Alexander attempted to get past Alfred to reach Demisi.  Lassius dropped the magical illusion and began dispelling her magical defenses, while Lorsanna reduced the spawn she had brought with her to dust with a single pulse of positive energy.  Once it became apparent that he couldn&rsquo;t get past the boneclaw on his own, Alexander summoned his horse, Ersefail and charged past towards Demisi, who was under a harassing barrage of spells from Lassius.  Alfred managed to trip Ersefail, but Alexander landed on his feet and kept charging.  Ulrick put Ashlyn to rest and then turned on Alfred.  Under this combined assault, Demisi&rsquo;s undead minions were destroyed.  Alexander demanded her surrender, which she promptly gave.  They escorted her back to the fane, and searched her, going through her possessions.  They grilled her about her motives and intentions, and she told them a second time how she sought the Tome of Strahd.  In an odd reversal, in the end the party essentially offered her the same deal that she had initially offered them.  The Tome of Strahd in exchange for her help.  Demisi, though thoroughly annoyed at the destruction of two very useful minions, agreed.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>16 Vulk</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: The party is able to reach and destroy Strahd after a confrontation with several of his vampire minions and traps, and finally Strahd himself.  Light and sun returns to Bolvaria.  With several people severely weakened, they returned to the town to heal.  Alexander allowed Demisi to depart in accordance with the bargain they had made earlier, despite Lassius's unvoiced plan to use her as a patsy.  However, unconscious as a result of the battle with Strahd, he was unable to interfere.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>17 Vulk</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: With Lorsanna's healing magic recovered, she restores Lassius to consciousness.  When he finds out about Demisi's departure, he is severely irritated, and with the mists now longer blocking egress from Bolvaria, he departs for the nearest House Sivis message station in order to report to his contacts.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>19 Vulk</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: A squad of Karnath special forces teleports in on the party while they are relaxing at the Blood on the Vine tavern, accompanied by Lassius.  They order the party to come with them immediately on pain of death.  Lassius assures them it will be alright, and after the party consents, they are teleported into the presence of King Kaius III.  For political reasons, the true story of what exactly had transpired in Castle Ravenloft would not be released, but a slightly alternative tale which kept them as the heroes would be supported by the Karnathi government, on the condition of their silence.  The heroes agreed, in relatively short order, and were given several gifts as rewards for their services to the crown.</span></p>"

"event","At 10pm CST, John McCain called Barack Obama to concede what has been obvious for some time for those of us who follow politics, or really, anybody with half a brain.  Barack Obama is now the President-Elect of the United States of America, showing that maybe people are not as unintelligent and guided by blind fear and prejudice as I had myself feared.  The Democrats made solid gains in Congress, picking up 5 senate seats from various moderate Republicans, and several seats in the House, widening our majority there.  This is truly what you call a mandate, not the 2004 election (take notes, FOX news).  According to <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html"">this</a> Obama won with a 52.1% of the popular vote versus McCain's 44.5%, a 7.6% difference.  The electoral college vote was even more so a landslide.  Though an exact count of the electoral vote will not be available for a day or two in the close states, Barack is confirmed to have carried 338 electoral votes, and I expect we will find he has over 350 when the votes are all tallied.  


It is very possible the Republican part will split in the next 12 years.  The party suffered massive desertions over Palin as a VP choice from it's intellectual section, including major writers for the National Review.  As many moderate congressmen were defeated this electoral cycle, that leaves only the farther right in power.  The farther to the right the party becomes, the farther right it's candidates become (those that pass the primary's).  As this effect continues, moderate republicans (typically social moderate economic conservatives, ie Collin Powell) will begin to desert the party, probably to the Libertarian party if a new party is not formed.  As the conservative base begins to divide itself between the right wing nut jobs (ie Palin and other Limbaugh-esque social conservatives) and the businessmen (aforementioned moderates), the Republican party base will begin to come apart at the seems.  This will likely issue in a 1 or 2 election cycle 3 party system in which the (relatively) united Democratic party demolishes the Libertarian and Republican party's split vote.  Eventually, the Republican party is voted in obsolescence. 

Countless groups and individuals cited Sarah Palin as a major factor in their endorsement of Barack Obama, including <a href=""http://pierretristam.com/Bobst/08/wf110108.htm"">The Economist</a>, <a href=""http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/fullpage/the-palin-effec.php"">numerous prominent conservative intellectuals</a>, among them <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/colin.powell/"">Collin Powell</a>, who is respected on both sides of the aisle.  It is said <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/28/mccain-snubbed-palin-on-c_n_138596.html"">McCain himself snubbed Palin</a> in the final days of the campaign.  But many people are talking about a Palin 2012 ticket.  Personally, I think for the those of us to the left, there could be little better.  As I discussed above, a Palin ticket will only further split and divide the weakened party.  The key is to, as I am sure we are all already planning to do, make Obama's Presidency go as well as possible.  We need to be in a strong position in 2012 if we want to break Republican power in this country for good.  Taking out well established party's is difficult, but it can be done.  Whether you're a Democrat or a moderate Republican, a Libertarian, or an independent, you should be behind this goal.  The Republican party marches only towards it's own destruction, and it tries to drag America with it.  Through it's political destruction, you can bring forth a new party responsive to the will of the people (as new party's often are) and end decades of corruption and cronyism that has characterized the Republican party as the party of rich old white men who run the country with one hand and big corporations with the other (though it might be better to say that big corporations run them).  Patriots, and here I speak DIRECTLY to everyone who ever said during the Bush presidency that it was our duty as Americans to support  the war, it is your duty now to preserve and assist the Obama Presidency in it's path towards greatness.  Do not let blind prejudice or hypocrisy blind you to the opportunity America has been given.  There will be no greater moment of historical greatness than this in your (likely) lifetimes.  Now is the time for change, the change that will bring about peace and propserity to America once more!"

"event","Yea! Chris and Courtney finally got married this past weekend.  The whole weekend was pretty great I'd say.  The trip there was pretty pleasant, despite a bit of traffic getting out of Dallas, but nothing too terrible.  We spent pretty much all Friday in our hotel room since the grooms section of the wedding party went out to a titty bar (apparently).  Megan's caught up now on Heroes (except for this most recent episode on Monday).  Speaking of which, that lightning chick is pretty heartless eh?  Anyway, so we woke up Saturday and went to the wedding, which was in this nice Catholic chapel.  I got all teary eyed when Courtney was walking up the aisle (I did at Steve and Mandy's too), and I even gave the polite bow to them as they went up (Matt made fun of me for it).  The pictures I took in the chapel didn't come out at all, but the video did (I hate not being able to see my pictures until I upload them... stupid broken screen), mostly the same with pictures at the hotel and the reception.  The stretch limo Chris and Courtney took everyone around in was pretty neat, even though that kind of vehicle isn't really my thing and I'd have rather had the money it cost if I was them.  Anyway, at brunch the next day I picked up a minor bit of food poisoning from something, not sure from what, but the trip back was mostly uneventful after a stop for me to be sick.  We played some of the Ravenloft game when we got back, and they are now aware of the werewolf problem plaguing Barovia.  Andrew's barely able to do any damage through the werewolves DR, which makes me smile.  Anyway, I think I'm gonna go check on Megan now."

"event","Well, I haven't written a note since I was in Japan, and so I felt like writing one now. Also, I have very little else to do right now. No upcoming papers, and my Xbox 360 is currently engaged in an exciting bout of Dead Rising Infinite mode... that is, Survivor mode. Basically, there's only a limited spawn of food items and you have to survive for as long as you can. I'm somewhere on towards the morning of my second day as I write this. The boring part is you can't stop and go do something else. Your health steadily ticks down, so I have to leave my Xbox on screen so that when my health gets to RIGHT BEFORE I perish of starvation, I eat a well cooked steak or whatever and go back to full health. I'm mainly going for the 5 day survivor achievement (gets me a laser sword), but I suppose if I'm doing well enough when that time ticks around, I may go for 7... not sure I can stand sitting around in a zombie filled mall for 4 extra hours but such is life. God the zombie noises are irritating. That goes on mute now.

I picked up Neverwinter Nights 2 and the expansion for it today. Patching them right now (which is why I have nothing to do but write this). Megan got Guild Wars, so I'm running the install of that on my comp... If anyone knows much about the game, let me know, I'm probably gonna have questions since if Megan winds up liking the game, I'll probably play it with her. None of the xpacs yet, just the main game.

I've gotten Halo 3, and it's pretty freaking sweat. I've beaten it solo on Heroic and co-op on Legendary with Socrates last night. I've gotten most of the acheivements, still missing Overkill, Killing Frenzy, all the campaign Meta-levels, Mongoose Mowdown, We're in for Some Chop, Lee R Wilson Memorial, Stepping Razor, and Headshot Honcho. I know that soudns like a lot, but except for the Spartan Officer and the campaign meta-levels, those are only worth like 5 gamerscore points each.

And speaking of gamerscore points, I rather like the acheivement system in games. It gives you little goals to shoot for as you play through the game, which for me adds a lot of good game time to them. Certainly, if not for acheivements, some games like Crackdown would have less replay value. And for the acheivements that are multiplayer skill based, it's something you can show off (""See, I really did get a killing frenzy in ranked free for all!""). However, I do wish you didn't need Xbox Live Gold membership to play online. It's a bit irritating that I have to log all my friends onto a guest account if me, Martone, and XR Chris want to play over Xbox live. Though when I had Soc create his Live account, it did give him a month of gold that was attached to my Xbox :/ He better use that shit. Anyway, I think it's almost morning on Day 2 of survivor and my NWN2 just finished patching, so talk to all of you later."

"event","Yesterday was quite a day.  We had class and then barely anytime to eat lunch with our buddies before we had to rush off to go to see the Tokyo-Edo museum and some sumo.  We went from Shibuya to Yoyogi to Ryogoku to get there.  

Once we got to the actual history museum itself, it was pretty impressive.  You go up this series of escalators and come out at the top of the museum and there's a replica kabuki playhouse and other buildings right there on either side of an old style Japanese bridge.  There's all kinds of historical Japanese stuff there, from palanquins to scrolls to those folding out screens.  There's also all the old electronic devices, from Toshiba and the like, as well as bicycles and phone booths and stuff.  There were a lot of kids there on field trip, and one of the braver ones came up to me and tried out his English to greet me.  It was pretty bad, but he was a 6th-grade equivalent, so it's better than the Japanese I spoke at his age (that is, none).  As I started talking with him, all his friends came over, and then eventually their whole class, and they took pictures with me.  I'll have that one uploaded eventually.  Then I wandered around some more and was talking to Chyun (pronounced June) and a group of schoolgirls wanted to take a picture with me too.  Japanese schoolgirls are the most excitable beings in the universe.  Anything I or Chyun said or did excited them immensely.  After that I wandered around some more until me and Chyun sat down near these two obasan.  When the sixth graders passed by and I gave them my usual ""Jya ne"", the two obasan became very excited and started talking to us.  I was able to understand most of it, except a few times when I had to say something in English a couple different ways until they understood it.  Eventually, their husbands came back and they all took pictures with me again.  But then it was time to go.  So we went and saw sumo.  I'll admit, I wasn't too interested, as I am not interested in most sports.  So after the entrance ceremony for the senior division sumo, I left and headed back to the hotel.  Carly and Lindsey went with me, but they went with Chyun to go shopping in Harajuku when we ran into him later.  Well, I stopped and got some KFC on the way back.  It costs me about 1000 yen for what would cost me maybe US$8 in terms of how much chicken I got.  And it tastes really different. I got the crispy chicken, but it wasn't anything like the chicken at home.  The skin was tougher and chewier, even though it was the crunchy chicken.  Though the meat tasted pretty much the same.  So I ate them when I got back to the hotel and relaxed a bit, went by the computer lab at the school and talked to Ami for a bit.  But then she had to go rush off to her training again, and I went back to the hotel.  So then we went downstairs and some of the conversation buddies were going to Tokyo tower.  I think Elizabeth and Megan went with them.  Me, Jenni, Richard and Larry went back upstairs and tried to figure out something to do.  Carly, Lindsey, Ami and Emi showed up dressed for ""going out"", but we didn't go with them (at least not at this point), and the four of us wandered around Harajuku.  We passed the African Festa poster, and had a chuckle about it, and our on way back ran into Carly and co, with the new additions of Kazumi, her boyfriend Sato, Ayumi, Chyun, and Lisa.  I switched to this group, cause I wanted to hang out with the Japanese students and I figured I'd be back before too long.  So we went to this restraunt that has really famous hamburgers... but they were 2100 yen and I wasn't hungry, so I didn't eat.  We all had a good time at dinner, but Kazumi (+Sato), Ayumi and Lisa had to go eventually.  So then we went to this bar in Shibuya for a while.  I have to say, overall I think it was probably not worth the ""entrance price"" of a 300\ bowl of stuff nobody wanted to touch, especially since you had to also order other food.  But the drinks were pretty cheap, for Japan.  Well, we were there for a while, and Ami had to go, so that just left the 5 of us.  We had a fun time figuring out the bill split (I am honestly still not quite sure exactly how it was divided), and headed back.  Turns out we'd not been paying attention to the time and Emi had missed the last train.  

So we went back to the hotel and of course they wouldn't let her in, cause she wasn't on the registry, and guests can't come in after 11.  The guards I don't believe spoke English, so I was talking to them in Japanese, and they didn't realize that Emi was Japanese.  Probably cause I said ""shoujotachi wa nihongo wo hanashimasen"" and they thought I was including her in that.  But they would have just told her to go home if they'd realized.  Unfortunetly for her, home is like an hour away by train and that's a ton of cab money, especially at like 12:45.  Carly and Lindsey kept tellign her to try and beg, and I tried to explain that doesn't work in Japan.  So eventually, they went upstairs and I, not about to leave a woman to sleep in Mcdonalds alone as was her plan, went with her.  We found Chyun, who had been unable to get ahold of the friend he had been going to hang out with, and the three of us went to what is apparently the most famous Starbucks in Japan, and we sat there looking down on the square for a few hours until they closed, I think aroudn 3.   Heading for McDonalds, I discovered a LOT of Japanese people sleep at Mcdonalds.  I mean a lot.  When we got there, and actually until around 6:30, there were more people asleep there than awake.  So we sat there chatting.  Around 4, I feel asleep for an hour, but woke up at 5 and rejoined the conversation.  After 7:30 or so, we started walking around Shibuya and then took Ginza-sen to Omanote-Sando station, walked back to the hotel from there, and I promptly went upstairs and passed out"

"event","So yesterday, me, Dan, and Andrew were hanging out, and it came out that Dan hadn't seen Heroes.  If you haven't seen Heroes, contact me.  I'll be able to fix what's broken with you.  So anyway, I showed him the first 6 episodes, and then it was like 10 or so, so I went to bed so I could have my finals with reasonable freshness (not that it stopped me from completly blanking on monotonicity, the prinicpal that a candidates increase in popularity should have a corresponding positive effect on his standing in a voting system).  But apparently, he spent most of last night and earlier today watching Heroes, going from episodes about 7-16.  After the Sabbat one-shot VTM game earlier in the day and after my Kara raid, we watched 17-20.  Since I'm going to operate on the assumption some people reading this will not have neccessarily seen it all, and I do not want to spoil excessivly.  But he was very addicted.  

So earlier tonight in Kara, I had my first run with Ordo's one shammy.  He did a pretty good job, picking up the strategies right away.  His gear was a bit under the level, but he only hit 70 like a week and a half ago, and he wasn't even Elemental until recently.  So I was a bit frustrated when on Maiden, Val switched him out for Tornaz instead of switching out Slomo's relativly useless priest.  Yes, we were having trouble keeping the tank up during repentance, but a priest isn't going to help with that, not when we had 3 priests in the raid, INCLUDING Ramses.  The problem was that because Jim decided he wanted to go on a date instead of showing up for his confirmed raid (or finding a properly geared replacement), that we had to have the warrior alts of two hunters as out MT and OT.  So I think we would have been fine with Tornaz instead of Slomo's priest and Pyroas healing and just setting his totems down.  Pyroas was honestly kind of upset about it too, and I pulled Val down a channel and talked to him about it.  He said he didn't want to wipe on Maiden and that we needed healers, which I did agree with, but not with which person he removed.  Well, we wound up getting through Curator without too much trouble, no good drops (though some shaman healing gloves dropped off Maiden righter after Pyroas was removed).  Anyway, so after Curator was down, I went, bought like 7 primal fire on the AH and finished my Spellfire chestpiece, and respec'd fire.  I'll be trying it out tommrow at Kara.  I lost about a 100 spellpower from mind mastery, but gained about 5% fire spell crit (lost a lot of main spell crit), and not entirely sure I spent my points right (got full Imp fire blast instead of the imp crit on scorch and flamestrike... not sure how important that is).  I'm hoping desperatly we down Prince and I get my Mindblade or at least my T4 hat or even that freaking cloak.  I'm gonna be 3 weeks behind onf DKP and loot, because I probably can't even go to Gruul's on Sunday (it is Mother's day, afterall).

Before Kara, we played the Sabbat one-shot game.  Our characters are as follows: Andrew's a Malkavian with 6 point Obfuscate and a really obsession with blowing stuff up and occasinally giggling insanely.  Matt's a city Gangrel, 6 pt Protean (yes, we're all 8th gen) who spends most of his time in wolf form.  Courtney and I are twins, about 400 years Embraced.  She's Toreador, I'm a pander (Sabbat Caitiff).  She has 6 point Auspex, so she can form a telepathic communication network at will between willing targets.  I'm a combat character, with 5 point celerity, 3 pt fortituide, 3 point obfuscate, and some potence.  However, my character is mute.  The original idea I had was that I wouldn't talk at the table at all IC, and Courtney's character would just speak in a creepy sort of way for both of us (we didn't know about the 6 dot Auspex power), but with the communication network, inter-player communication is actually even easier than it is with Thomas.  The 4 of us are a Sabbat war-pack, and we've been turned lose on the DFW metroplex with a number of objectives.  The first was to damage the Texas Motor Speedway track, the second was to get a souveneir from Six Flags (not from the shops), and for the third instruction, we were to go to this random intersection and get instructions there.  Then there were 3 more instructions after that, but we didn't get to those today, so I'll talk about them probably in a month or more.  Anyway, so Andrew basically took care of the first objective by himself, just walked in obfuscated, planted some bombs, walked out, detonated, and we drove off in our van which he cloaked.  6 pt obfuscate makes you REAL hard to stop.  For the six flag thing, we had Matt mist form inside the gate, and then turn into a dog, and bury a bomb under the Texas Giant in order to distract all the security guards.  In the meantime, I broke through the wooden fence and used Mask of a Thousand Faces to appear to be a security guard.  Of course, I further used obfuscate to make sure no one noticed, but since I have the False Reflection merit, any later camera recordings will show my security guard appearence.  I went over to the superman roller coster and after the bomb at the giant went off, I climbed up the roller coster and broke off the Superman statue.  On my way down, I stuck a note on the statue that says ""I quit"" and made sure to show it to the cameras on my way out.  After that an emergancy curfew was declared on the DFW area, but with the 6 pt obfuscate that didn't really matter.  We got to the intersection and there was an envelope with more instructions and 3 keys, with three different colors.  Turns out the keys go to three vans.

The rest of the epic story later, playing some WoW with Megan and going to bed"

"event","I used to write regular updates in my journal about what progress I was making in my various games, be they tabletop or console, or pc, online or off.  Since I set up Facebook to import entries from my LJ, I do this much less frequently, least all my more casual friends who are unprepared for the depths of my devotion to having amazingly powerful imaginary powers be left aghast and in horror of my true form.

However, tonight I felt like writing just such an update, so screw them anyway.  I dunno if I mentioned that DM Chris has started up a Vampire game, but he has.  I've got a 10th gen Ventrue (I would have gone for 8th, but we were capped), and I like to think of myself as the leader or at least co-leader of our little band (Courtney's Malkavian being the only other contender).  So far the game has been a lot of fun.  My character is the 'money' so to speak, I've got 5 in resources and provide for the rest of the group generally when we need things.  I've got my fingers in politics, but mostly in economics.  My character, Thomas Redfield, is also very formal.  He wears a suit unless the situation absoluetly demands otherwise.  I have, or should I say had, a ghoul named Alice who I was planning on Embracing and making my childe, but as you will see shortly, that didn't work out as planned.  The other members of the coterie are William Wright (Socrates, Tremere), Amelia (Courtney, Malkavian), Nate (Matt, combat-caitiff), and Alexander 'Alex' Redfield (Andrew, Gangrel), my character's biological nephew and a living incarnation of Andrew's ADHD and hyperactive disorders magnified with willfully roleplayed stupidity, and vampiric powers.  The coterie as a whole is not terribly fond of my nephew, I think.  Anyway, there's also Megan's vampire, Clarissa, who actually shares a sire with Nate.  Their sire is a Toreador and has now twice sired Caitiff.  However, unlike Matt, who developed immense physical powers (Potence, Fortitude, and Celerit), Megan essentially just developed the Toreador normal power set (Presence, Celerity, Auspex).  She is actually our most power Auspex user, followed by Courtney (at the time of her creation, followed pretty far behind.  Courtney only had 2 dot Auspex initially, Megan had 4 starting).  Over the course of games so far, Thomas has wound up blood bonded to Amelia thanks to her sympathetic bond, bypassing his unusual resistance to being blood bonded (Unbondable).  William also wound up bonded with her in a similar fashion.  I've also begun learning Obfuscate, and am up to 2 dots already.  It'll be a bit to earn my third though, I believe that takes 14 XP, which is anywhere from 3-5 games played.  And once I get that, I'll still need another 21 for Vanish from Mind's Eye.  After that, it's really just a matter of deciding wether I want to go for max presence or dominate first. 

Anyway, essentially, our coterie are the 5 councilors of the Denton area.  We were granted the right of domain over the city as a wartime act by the Prince of the Dallas due to recent Sabbat incursions.  The last two games the incursion has basically begun.  The Sabbat crashed a van full of shovelheads into the Argyle police station, and then later a bomb in the van detonated.  About a week later, in the game we played tonight, Thomas woke up to find his house burned down and his favorite ghoul Alice dead.  I was somewhat aghast at this development.  Fortunetly, my two personal body guard ghouls Sam and Jeff survived, so I'm not without my minions still.  The assistant sheriff contacted everyone in the coterie and asked us all to come meet him at this place in North Dallas, which is what Thomas and Amelia were on their way to do when DM Chris got interrupted by a phone call from his grad students.  Well, anyway, so that's where we stopped for the evening tonight.

In D&D news, I've started running Expedition to Castle Ravenloft.  I think things are going well so far.  We're testing out the homebrewed Priest core class that me and Matt came up with.  So far, it's a bit overpowered.  Matt took quicken turning and the Lightbringer 'destroy undead' varient (which in my opinion is everyway superior to the normal turning), and essentially he can drop a fireball on the undead in a 30 foot radius around him about 8 times per day as a free action.  I'm gonna have to shut him down with Divine Interdiction during major fights or something.  Also, his and Andrew's combined Lay on Hands is essentially a 1-2-ko on any boss character.  They beat the Blaspheme in the church in 2 rounds with no deaths (though one VERY close call on the part of DM Chris's Aereneal elf necromancer wizard).  I've introduced Demisi into the module, but I won't give the details on her since my players can and probably will read this.  The fix DM Chris suggested was simply making the Lay on Hands ability for Matt not work on unwilling targets, which I like.  Stops him from channeling all that energy.  Andew is still ridiculous though.  He can get his AC into the 30s and cause he's a 'Holy' paladin (High Cha), he has a TON of lay on hands.  Further compounded is the fact that I gave Paladins (and priests) Vitalic Touch instead of Lay on Hands because it was lame that the Dragon Shaman got a better Lay on Hands than the Paladin.  Anyway, as might be thusly implied if your familiar with the module, the party has defeated the zombie plague that was overrunning the town of Barovia, and now they're helping clean up and deciding what to do next."

"event","See, I dated this for the day I got back, but I ACTUALLY am writing it in late April.  So the details may not be fresh in my mind.  However, I wanted to kill some time before Karazhan.

Moving back in time, me and Megan spent a day or two back at her flat, doing much as we had been before the Salisbury trip.  I discovered that a lot of British streets look alike and did get lost by myself at one point.  Anyway, on Thursday, the day of our journey to London, I discovered a new disaster, and by disaster I mean monstrous inconvience for me.  Megan's 85 pound suitcase had broken it's wheel (I suspect the 85 pounds it contained could be involved).  Of course, this meant she wound up carting along my functional 10-15 or so pound suitcase, while I literally dragged her 85 pounder across England.  English streets, like a lot of other things that I mentioned, are generally old.  This means rough and/or uneven.  This means dragging this suitcase was one of the most frustrating experiences of my trip.  I really hated that suitcase.  Further, it is a pretty big suitcase so it was hard to find a way to fit it in on the train.  Also, the ground by the station in Hull was especially rough and troublesome to drag an 85 pound suitcase across.  However, we did eventually, after dragging said suitcase across a connecting train station or two, make it to London King's Cross station, which is actually a really nice place.  Rather than drag said suitcase across London trying to find the hotel I had arranged for, we promptly flagged a taxi.  As it turns out, the hotel was across the street, on the other side of a restraunt.  Was worth it not to have to drag that suitcase an extra block though.  

Once in our Comfort Inn room, we settled in and began deciding what to do with our evening.  I suggested we start with a walk around London, which we did.  We found a most excellent pub, and had the first good food that I'd had since I arrived in England.  We then went exploring checking out a number of different shops around London.  We almost went to a production of Spam-a-lot, but it turns out Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of those movies that Megan has never seen, so it seemed a little pointless.  After an enjoyable evening exploring Covenant Garden, we went back to the hotel, and rambunctious cuddling ensued.  

To be continued later with the next day and tales of Manchester"

"event","So today I returned from my visit with Megan to Stonhenge. It was very cold and very windy. That is my first impression of Salisbury. Anyway, since I'm in England, I will now regale you with tales of my travels so far. You will be very impressed, and soon, you will need my stories as fish need water.

The flight here was largely boring. In Chicago airport, I discovered that the Chile's there is not like a Chile's in a normal restraunt setting. They will bring you what you order, but generally not check in for refills and ""would you like anything else""'s or the like. On the flight to England, I was more bored. Actually, I must now rewind to the Denton flight and say that it was no more boring than normal travel, and my next-seat mate was a fairly nice woman from Denton named Lane. We talked some and the rest of the time I read the Expedition to Castle Ravenloft book. Back to the Chicago flight. After reading all of the second Blade of the Flame book (Matt, I imagine you'll like this one too), I started on the first Heirs of Ash book. I haven't finished it yet, but it's pretty good, not as spectacular as the Dreaming Dark or Dragon Below trilogies. However, I'd been reading for the better part of 8 hours at this point and I wanted something else to do. Unfortunetly, planes are lacking much to do. As my head is well above the back of the seat, I could not rest my head against it to sleep, because the seat before me was too close to me to slouch. Indeed, it was painful to my knees not to sit upright, and painful to my neck to do so for long periods of time, an overall mix of discomforts. The in flight meals, both dinner and breakfast were surprisingly good. However, the inflight movies, once finally begun, were pretty bad. The first one was an old Anthony Hopkins film called the Wold's Fastest indian. It appeared to involve an old Australian or new Zealand man played by Anthony Hopkins who had some kind of dream of breaking hte land-speed record in his home-made bike. All the other characters seem pretty supportive and there wasn't really an apparent antagonist. I say this without particular certainty for I wasn't listening to the audio for most of the movie. After that, the movie Last Holiday was played. It was somewhat cliche and predictable, but not unenjoyable. Anyway, at around 5:45 local, we made landfall in Manchester. Customs was a simple affair, I htink because of the (local) early time of our arrival. Nonetheless, it was still 7 o clock by the time I had sorted out myself a train route, gotten my rail pass stamped, gotten some very pricey pounds, and set out on my way to see Megan. 

It took me about 2 and a half hours to get to Hull, which actually put me exactly when I thought I would get there, despite having arrived an hour earlier than I thought I would (at the airport). Me and Megan greeted eachother with a fierce hugging. Then we traveled through the Hull City Center to get to a bus to get to her dorm-apartment-place-thingy. Well, you don't need to have the rest of hte day spelled out for you, but me and Megan hadn't seen eachother for near 2 months, so I bet you can imagine. Also, I had my first experience with Jet lag, as my sleep schedule for all of Saturday and Sunday was completly random, with me falling asleep whenever I felt like. Anyway, so Sunday, once we got out of bed, we went to see Hull. 

Let me tell you something about England. England looks EXACTLY like the movies and pictures you have seen of it. You may think that English street that looks like it's from the 1800s is just some historic part of town or mock'd up for a movie set. No, they ALL actually look like that. I rather like it. There are lots of old things here. Buildings, streets, walls. On the train ride we passed a house (still being lived in) encrusted with veins. Very classic looking. All the stores here look like individual kind of businesses, very few chains, franchises, or mega-stores. We went to the Mission Pub, and I had a carvery, which is like a buffet, where you choose a meat and some potato looking things that taste like sweet carrots. Don't know what those were. Eventually, however, the freezing winds drove us back to the bus station, where we huddled for many a minute while we waited for the bus to take us to sanctuary. When we returned home, I caught Megan up on the nonfiller Bleach. Oh, the previous night she had watched the first 6 of Haruhi, but I fell asleep randomy throughout. Anyway, so then Megan callously played World of Warcraft, neglecting the attention needs of a boyfriend who had traveled halfway across the world to see her. Not really (the callous part, she did play Warcraft). Eventually, there was rambunctious cuddling, and sleep.

Monday morning we woke up at some time, and went to the train station. You see, Megan, not having a rail pass had to buy these ticket things. I don't know anything about htem. Anyway, so we boarded the train that would tkae us to another train, that would take us to a third train, that would take us to Salisbury. This whole process took the better part of the day, and had I been more aware of that, I might have thought to eat in ADVANCE of the trip. This will lead into a major part of our tale. Anyway, so around 4:30, we arrive in Salisbury. it is also windy in Salisbury. Possibly more windy. We walk from the train station to our hotel, the Legacy Rose & Crown. I liked the name. Also, when Megan showed me a picture, it looked very sort of classic inn-ish, but I didn't realize the whole town looked like that. They have a market in Salisbury, BTW. Anyway, we checked into the Rose & Crown without too much difficulties, though for being in room 16, it's actually quite a walk from the front Desk. When we arrived, Megan was aghast to discover she had FOOLISHLY booked twin beds, instead of a double. This entire post is best narrated in JC's fake English accent, as he is speaking it outloud, as he types it. Megan thinks it's hot. Or cute. He could just be exaggerating the hot bit. None to fear however, for JC had mastered the simple art of pushing two beds together, thus solving the great twin bed dilema. However, though our noble heroes were starving from not eating all day, room service did not start for another hour, and the restraunt in the hotel for an hour afterthat. Lamenting their earlier pass-up of the local Burger King, the couple was forced to watch British Television, or telly, for an hour to stave off the fierce hunger which had beset them. Once 6o'clock had rolled around, the more masculine of the pair quickly dialed Room Service, to request two classic burgers. Despite three specifications that these burgers contain only meat and cheese, as both preferred, when they arrived some half an hour later, they contained meat, cheese, and some sort of red sauce that Megan claims was deemed relish by these mad brits. ""It makes you puke"" she says. So, taking hte tray with him, JC braved the long hallway back to the front desk. Once there, the long-suffering clerk had to endure JC's request that the burgers be fixed to the way he'd ordered them. A woman came and took the burgers, and JC returned to their room, feeling satisfied that the order could not be wronged again. Little did our heroes know, when the burgers returned, there was only burger. No bun. No cheese. Also, no relish-type things, thank god adds Megan. Rather than attempt to get the cheese, and thus, what he'd ordered, JC decided it best if he just asked for some buns. Once the buns were in hand, JC and Megan discovered, British cannot in fact, make good burgers. They have also contracted the mad cow disease. Anyway, then they watched more British television for a time. 

From this watching, they learned the British are very concerned about the following topics: A cricket player, who had gotten drunk the night before and capsized a peddle boat, and as a result was demoted from vice-captain of his crickett team. C02 emissions. And Iraq. Mostly the Cricket player though. Also, the British still watch Friends reruns.

In hte morning, we received a surprisngly good breakfast considering the last nights burger fiasco, however, bacon apparently is ham. Also, no apple juice. Further, the British have a terrible spin-off of hte Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon, called Sonic Underground. It was awful. I cannot even begin to describe hte pain I felt, when any character opened their mouth. Or moved. Or appeared anywhere on screen.

We checked out of the hotel, and went to Stonehenge. It was windy as well. Being cowards, we quickly fled to the gift shop after taking two pictures. It was REALLY windy. And whenever I say windy, I mean your balls were frozen off. Then we re-boarded the bus, and JC made several new Japanese friends, as he practiced his rarely recentyl utilized Japanese language skills. However, the Japanese people pretended that he was good at their language, despite the fact that JC was able to tell them in Japanese, that he did not believe their compliments. When JC and Megan exited the bus, they went and had the formerly eschewed Burger King. It was actually decent. However, they don't give you free refills and they don't completly fill your cup. JC found this dissapointing, as he was going through soda withdrawl. When we got the rail station, and sat in the waiting room for our train, we were again joined by JC's new Japanese friends. One insisted JC visit him in Osaka in may. JC would be glad to comply, but has already forgotten all their names, remembering only that he enjoyed their company, however brief. Once on the train, JC and Megan coveresed with a merry old couple about our impressions of England. They were also very friendly, and we approve of such friendly travelling old people.

MANY hours of train riding later, we have finally returned home to place this note online for your reading pleasure. Enjoy."

"event","Well, there's still 22 days between me and seeing Megan in England.  I had a dream about her last night, which was very enjoyable.  I guess there's not really much to say about it besides that, but I miss her a lot.  She got 60 today in WoW, which made me proud.  Now she can come to Outland and start getting the good stuff.  Though Carianta said most of the quest rewards were for shamans, but most things would probably be an upgrade from that ZF leather hat.

I tried a heroic instance tonight, Shadow Labs.  Actually wasn't that hard up to the first boss.  The Fel Overseers gave us some trouble, but we got a strategy working for em and took em down, 8.5k MS or not.  Then we got to Blackheart the Inciter and MAN is that fucker annoying on Heroic.  On top of all the irritating shit he does normally, he has some kind of war-stomp charge that punts you, and he'll usually smash you in teh air with the same attack, which for me, = death.  I'm up to 12k/21k Scryers rep, and I've hit 375 Tailoring and 369 Enchanting.  At least farming the mana-forges translates directly into profit for me."

"event","Well, I originally intended to provide another update when I first hit 70, but that was like 3 weeks ago now.  I made my goal of 1 level a day from release till 70, though I was quite exhausted by it.  I've geared myself out with mostly L70 blues (of my original L60 gear, I've retained only the Neltharion's Tear for this long), and I'm near to 800 spellpower and 25% crit versus L70 mobs.  Not bad if I do say so myself.  I'm still Arcane-frost, which pretty much owns the crap out of pure frost now, because the bottom half of the frost tree is mediocre and the bottom half of the arcane tree is amazing (except prismatic cloak and slow).  
Megan is in England now, studying at her university there.  I'm really looking forward to seeing her again over spring break, which seems like freaking forever away, but is really only like 34 days or so away.  Still seems like a really long time though.  We'll btoh be on the same flight back to the states at the end of the Spring break week but I still don't know if she's gonna have to spend most of her break in Granger or if she'll be able to spend it up in Denton with me.  She's been playing WoW still, her hunter hit 54 today and her priest is 21.  We were partying together, my shaman and her priest when my internet went down earlier today.  At first I thought it would come back up, but it failed to do so, and I started to increasingly panic about missing my Karazan raid at 7.  I wound up calling pretty much everybody.  I eventually made it to DM Chris's where I conducted my raid.
Karazan went well, we downed the first boss on our first try and got to the second boss, which took us about 4 tries to down.  ON the fourth attempt, when we downed him, however, the server crashed.  I've got a screenshot of me standing over his dead body, finishing off the last one of his adds right as the server crashed.  Jolly fun that was.  Hopefully they'll give us a drop of his body and just random loot from it.  Somehow, I think they may just say that we're out of luck though.  That wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.  Anyway, right now I'm typing this in the lobby of the Exchange (the Gateway, as it's now called), and I guess I'll go check if my computer's internet in my apartment is working, which I guess means plugging it back in and all.  If not, I'm gonna go home tommrow so I can be on in for Karazan (though Elord will probably get the mage slot.  I don't know WHY we want to rotate out people when we don't have to, but I suppose letting them see the difference in our performance levels is good in the long run)."

"event","Alright, so Burning Crusade release story: Last night, Socrates stayed over at my place so he, Andrew, and I could all go togetehr to get the Burning Crusade tonight.  So we've been hanging out all day, plus John Martone and Teresa, and of course roomie Chris and Robert.  We've being done various video game stuff, and I uploaded a shitload of anime to Martone's harddrive.  

So 10:55 comes around and we set out for the Wal-mart by the Gamestop.  According to Matt, people were in line as early as 9 o clock.  We spent about an hour there, with me talking smack to Dennis over the phone.  I discovered the name of his undead mage on Azgalor, Klauth.  At least now I know which one I'm killing.  Anyway, so there was a long ass line which was at least half the time we spent there.  Me and Soc made fun of Andrew for purchasing hair care products after he said ""I bought only what I needed!"" which apparently includes an ironing board, the aforementioned haircare products, and hangers.  The two things we actually came for, a space heater and tortillas to replace the ones of Chris's we ate were also in that basket.  So anyway, around 11:42 we head over to the Gamestop.  There is a line stretching to the end of the block around the Panera bread, which we join.  At 12 they start letting in people a few at a time in, and around 12:50 we finally get in.  We were VERY cold by this time.  We passed the time talking to the people behind us in line, who were varying degrees of serious about the game.  We all agreed that Warlocks and hunters are overpowered.  So me and Soc and Andrew all got our copies... I almost bought an Alliance t-shirt, or a patch, but I wasn't really sure where I'd put the patch, and I couldn't justify spending $20 on my Alliance pride.  So then we went and dropped Soc off and I have returned here to install BC.  I've been working on installs and post-install patches for the past hour or so, I should be on final patching phase now.  I'll see you all in Outland.

"event","I will state first off I am still moderatly intoxicated as I type this.  Earlier today, me and Andrew went over to Martone's to play some Resistance Fall of Man on John's PS3.  By the third game, me and John had a clear lead of ownage over the other players.  There was none who could face our combined might (the second best team barely scored 40 by the time we scored 200 in 2v2), and then some stuff happened and around midnight me Andrew and Matt went out to the bars, abn thend back to Martones and lpayed some mroe Resistance, where hte bottom two players had to t ake s hot.  I wound having to take 2 shots, well really, 1nd a hald.  My typing is fucked up right now.  Anyway, so it was fun, and I'm probably not fit to operate a computer giht now as I can see my ability to type is fucking terrible.  I will see you all tommrow."

"event","It's funny how I'll go period where I put at least one good update a week in and then I'll go like months where I only put in maybe one or two entries a month, tops.  Me, Megan, my parents, my brother, and his friend Andy went to the TSO concert last weekend (I guess a week ago today), and it was pretty good.  It was mostly the same show as last year, a few different songs.  Since we weren't in the 7th row from the stage this year like last time, I didn't get as pumped up, but it was still really good.  Since Sunday though, Megans been back in Granger, where she'll be till the end of the year.  She promised to make it back for New Years though.  We've been playing together a bit on WoW, but she's had work a lot, so not as much as I'd like.  It'll probably be more hectic when she goes to England and we're on a 6 hour time Difference.  As of when Honor is calculated tonight, I should have my Grand Marshall's Mageblade, and then it'll just be a matter of getting someone who can do the +30 Spellpower enchant.  That's is a sweet enchant, and if it ever drops for Ordo again when I'm in MC on Emiri (This will be a rare occasion), I will pay off every enchanter who rolls over me to let me have it.

So I'm uploading screenshots now to Facebook and to the OS website cause I'm bored while waiting for the honor to be calculated (and taking breaks to write in this entry in between).  So what else should I mention?  Oh, I got Megan the Gargantuan Black Dragon mini.  She really liked it.  I decided (before I presented it to her) to stat out her dragon and give him a story.  I asked Megan what kind of personality she thought my next dragon should have and she picked a sneaky conniving type dragon, which works great for black dragons.  So I named him Onystrax and started statting him out.  At first I was like ""damn, this dude is a pussy compared to Maelstryx"" (who is my Colossal red).  I ran a combat test, and Matt and Socrates's L20s were able to take down Onystrax, albeit with it being a bit close.  So, I went to the Wizards forum and asked for some help with how to set up a black dragon.  They gave me some great suggestions and now I'm confident that Onystrax can handle himself much better and won't be taken down by two L20s who are poorly synergized to defeat a dragon.  Added a lot of elements to Onystrax, like having his lair be underwater (black dragons have the water subtype), and that alone should make him more difficult to defeat, since he has a natural swim speed and most characters aren't designed to fight very well under or in the water.

Honor should be up soon, so I'm logging in.  Also, the screenshots are posted in the Fun in Azeroth album, so take a look (this is an LJ entry, but it goes to Facebook now)."

"event","Hey, so I haven't been updating this much.  I've been pretty busy.

So today we were supposed to have the first game of my dragon-fighting mini-campaign.  It didn't happen, and I was pretty pissed about that for a while, but then I got distracted talking about other stuff, so I didn't really stay focused on being mad.  While Megan owned this puzzle that Chris and Courtney bought, me, Soc, Matt, and Chris talked about game ideas.  The one I really liked was we pitch our concept to him.  He then chooses our levels, feats, etc.  When we level up, based on our role play, he picks the level we gain in.  I thought it was a kind of neat concept.  Anyway, then around 10 me and Megan went back to my place, and I went to AQ20 on SHinamori for the first time, got my Battleshout book.

THis past week was really busy.  In addtion to doing prep work for my dragon game that didn't happen, I had to write a paper for Japanese politics on the point at which Japan's entry into WWII became inevitable.  Last week I completed my paper on the War of the Pacific.  This is not WWII.  This is some war between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru back in the 1870s and Chile basically winds up destroying the other two in terms of long term gains.  Nobody but Bolivia really even cares about it anymore.  I also brought Megan home with for Thanksgiving, and I think she enjoyed meeting some of my extended family.  She played Monopoly with my mom and two of my cousins very much not by the rules.

I went back into a regular weekend raiding schedule this weekend.  Went with OS to Naxxaramus earlier today, took down Instructor and got Anub to 10% (not bad for second time attempting him).  Going to BWL tommrow.  I'm enjoying being back in the swing of things somewhat.

Oh, I should also mention that Megan bought WoW behind my back.  She's actually had it for like a month now but didn't tell me cause she was worried I'd be upset about her getting it (cause of Mary).  I'd actually been considering getting it for her myself since she'd been playing on my account, but when she quit (cause she got her own copy) I thought she'd lost interest.  So she's got a L20 hunter now, and I'm helping her level as best as I can.  She's almost caught up to all my alts though, I'll have to get Taimon or Ichitenken going."

"event","Probably not gonna eat any peaches though.  Anyway, musical reference aside, I am going to Granger with Megan tommrow.  I'm kinda looking forward to it, as I've honestly never really been outside urban/suburban areas for any length of time greater than required to pass through them on the highway.  I got in trouble with Megan earlier for kind of looking down my nose a bit sort of attitude that I took towards farmers.  I apologized though, and I think she's letting me off the hook.  Also, though, she said that I would become fat from eating at midnight, but I don't think that's true if I don't go to sleep at midnight (it's 2:30 now, so...).  Though this will make yet another class where I'm too exhausted to stay awake.  I really need to take a break at some point and just sleep for 12 hours a few days in a row.  Earlier today, I came home and was watching roomie Chris play FFXII in the living room and I passed out, and woke up like 3 hours later, and still felt like shit.  

I've returned to Ordo Solaris in WoW, thoguh I'm not really playing much anymore.  It's kind of a time-killer activity now, time that I should be spending doing research prep for my 4 term papers, or studying for my remaining mid-term (American Foreign Policy).  I got a 75 on my International Conflicts, which is upsetting cause I know I had a lot more to write on the second question, but I ran out of time cause I spent the first hour and fifteen minutes of the class answering the first question.  Not the professor's fault or anything, I should have just managed my time better.  Me and Megan helped eachother on our Japanese history midterms.  By help I mean she corrected the hell out of my grammer (which is atrocious as usual), and I corrected her factual errors (year and a half of Japanese history classes gives me an edge).I don't know what I got on it yet, my grade still isn't posted to WebCT, so I just emailed Dr Hall about it.  I got an 88 on my Japanese politics midterm.  But primarily, what I need to be working on right now is my term papers.  I have papers ranging from an expected five to ten pages all due in a cluster fuck around the end of november/start of December.  I need to get a lot more reading done for International conflicts and American Foreign done as well.  Further game news, I've been playing Disgaea 2 in spurts.  Contrary to my Disgaea 1 policy of 'Laharl first, second, third, so on and so forth', I've been working on making several character powerful, or at least reasonably so.  So far Adell, Jancarius (Galaxy Mage), and Nijin (sword using tier 4 Majin) are my primaries.  I'm working on powering up the character who used to me a thief, but I reincarnated her into a Majin just to level her sword skill more easily.  I've been doing lots of item world just to extract specialists and the like from items.  I need to go and update a lot of my 'main parties' gear, but almost all of it has lover specialists on it and I just don't want to take the time to extract all those from 5 to 10 people.  I've also rented Mercenaries, which is a lot of fun.  It kicked my ass a little today, the step up in difficulty from the Club missions to the Diamond ones was pretty signifigant.  Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is kicking my computers ass, making it less fun to play.  Anyway, I'm wasting valuable sleep time, to which I am now going."

I was fighting my way into the tower, and she helped kill the lookout.  So then I was wandering around the tower, trying to figure out where to use the Torch of Retribution, and she MCs me and shows me where to do it.  So then we go from tower to tower, helping eachother out, except when this Alliance rogue ganked her.  I couldn't really stop him, but I did taunt all the mobs off of her.

"event","I don't think I've updated in like two weeks.  So here we go.

I met this girl named Megan back in late August on Facebook.  And by met, I mean I was sitting in Crumley at work (I think I referenced this in an earleir entry) and messaging people with common interests and she was one of the people who responded.  So, anyway, we've been talking on Facebook for about a month (leading up to late September) and had beeen accumalating a list of movies which she had not yet witnessed.  So, like three Tuesdays ago, she finally came over for what I viewed as an unofficial date.  Oh, also, she's in my Japanese History class with Hall-sensei.  I forgot to mention that.  Anyway, so we watched some movies and there was some kissing, and she was like ""How long have you had this planned?"" and I was like ""Since I invited you over.  I thought it was pretty obvious."" and she was like ""Yeah.""  Subtlety has never really been my strong point, and making my intentions obscure really only confuses and complicates things, ya know?  Anyway, so then the next Tuesday, we hung out again and decided to officially go out.  Then we were gonna hang out that Thursday, but instead she had some stuff come up with her psychotic-sounding ex calling her and yelling at her or something.  So then Friday, she played D&D with us in DM Chris's game.  She's playing a guisarme fighter for her first character.  I think she had fun.  Anyway, so afterwords we went back to my place and she slept over, then woke up and went to take a shower (at her place), before the two of us and DM Chris and Courtney, and Matt, went to go see The Departed, which is an EXCELLENT movie.  I highly reccomend it.  Main characters die, and this often endears me to such media.  Anyway, so then we went to Bennigan's and I treated her, an experience which I found enjoyable (though my finances are like ""hey, damn it, what about us?"" this month), and hten to Main Event Laser Tag. I accidently crushed DM Chris's toe when I ran around the corner directly onto it.  It bled a lot.  It was one of those accident could have happened to anyone things, but I still felt bad.  At Main Event, me and Courtney established official tradition of the two of us sitting out on the games of pool and instead drinking and having conversations.  I enjoyed a great deal.  Courtney, of course, is light-weight though, so as soon as we got back to DM Chris's she went to bed.  Anyway, I had something called High Quality H20 and I'm told it consists of ""every clear liquour known to man, and sprite""  I took one sip and was like ""wow."" Same with Courtney.  Chris just took a sniff and was like ""uh uh, I have to drive.""  Anyway, so that all went really well.

Sunday, I went home with my parents for my parent-sponsored birthday meal.  We had Joe's Crabshack, and they had me ride around on a wooden stick horse thing (I forget what they're called) with ginormus sunglasses while they sang happy Birthday.  It was fun, and filling.  Also had MC.  Soc didn't get to go cause his connection went out when they were looking for Paladins.

Anyway, nothing really happened monday, worked on Shinamori.  Tueday was my game of D&D, went well, though it was pretty short game.  Wensday was Andrew's birthday."

"event","So, me, Matt, Soc, and Andrew just finished watching Oldboy. It's a Koren flick. If you keep up with asian cinema, you probably heard of it. This guy gets imprisoned one night for fifteen years. WHen they eventually let him out, he starts seeking revenge (for obvious reasons). Oh, and they murder his wife and frame him for it like a year into his imprisonment. Anyway, I don't really want to go too much into the plot or anything in case anyone wants to see it, but it's realyl good. If your horrified by blood and violence though, it's not a movie for you. I wouldn't say it's excessive, but I'm pretty desensitized. So, I guess don't watch it with a weak stomach. But it's not about the gore and violence, they're just by products of Oh Dae-su's rage."

"event","I guess the last entry was the wedding, at least the last one that said anything.  So, I'll pick up a quick overview from previous days.  Yesterday, we concluded Whisper of the Vampire's Blade in a wholly unorthodox method that I'll go into greater detail on later, for all you dorks who are interested in how my D&D games run.  Of the people that read this... that's probably just me.  Oh well, it's my journal, I dun have to entertain ya.  Courtney's almost ready to take her first shot at DMing.  I've stepped up to the breach to be helpful and asked to play a Duskblade.  Afterall, Matt wants to play a Dragon Shaman and Andrew a Beguiler.  I should get a PHB2 Core class as well.  Still want to do the Hexblade, Warblade, Duskblade, Warmage party one day.  Soc was like ""We'd need a healer?""  ""For what? What are we not gonna kill in the first round.""  We'd call it team badass or something.  Of course, Duskblade is a tad on the powerful 1 v 1 side, but Warblade is just retarded.  I hate that class (and that book, really).  Phil just started watching Bleach and we were discussing it.  It went kinda like this:
RUNFORYOURLIVES5: yo
WASD1337: Watching bleach
WASD1337: wtf owns
RUNFORYOURLIVES5: Told you it was fucking sweet
Anyway, so that made me flip back and forth around Bleach watching various scenes of pownage.  I really want all my fighters Shinigami style.  Especially Shijin/Terjon.  With a weapon of Legacy, he's absolutetly perfect for at some point delivering a dramatic speech and then going ""BANKAI!""  Even if everybody else makes fun of it, who cares? It'll be fun.

"event","This was a great (and expensive) weekend.  So, on Thursday, Dennis wakes me up at like 9 o clock to say he's in Oklahoma and will be here in 6 hours.  So I'm excited about him being on his way, and I decide to stay up instead of rolling on my back and going back to sleep.  I forget if I mentioned it, but all my Thursday and Friday classes last week were cancelled because my PSCI professors (3 of 4 classes) are attending a conference in Philadelphia this weekend.  Or last weekend rather.  Dunno why Professor Hall's class was canceled, but it was too so...  Anyway, so at noon, Matt drove me to the Men's Warehouse, and I picked out a suit.  Well, the suit was about 315 as it turned out.  I was like, ""k, I guess I need a shirt... and a tie.  I suppose I can go in my tennis shoes.""  Matt and the tailor lady gave me this horrified look ""Tennis shoes at a wedding? Absolutetly not!"" So then I wound up with some $95 dollar shoes.  Then there were the alterations to the suit and shirt, a belt, and a tie, and some socks.  Total wound up being like 600 dollars.  I was like ""ow"" cause I only expected to spend three or four hundred tops.  So then as we're on our way back to Denton, Dennis calls to get directions to where I live.  I was like ""I thought you said you were 6 hours out."" and he was like ""I guess not."" So I gave him directions to the Exchange and he had to wait while we drove back from Lewisville.  So then we arrived back at my apartment, and I was like ""DENNIS!"" and he was like ""Oh, no...RUN!"" and then we were all ""good to see ya again"" and such.  So then we went back up to my apartment and he was like ""This place is pretty nice, actually"".  There's gonna be a lot of quoting in this entry, I can tell that already.  Anyway, so then he and his girlfriend Rhonda, whose fairly pretty and pretty nice wanted to take a shower.  Rather, I thought they were gonna shower seperatly, but then when Dennis didn't exit the bathroom, I was like ""Oh, they're showering together... I just hope they don't have sex in there or something."" and turned up my music.  Anyway, so then Andrew and Socrates came and Emily, and we were hanging out some more (this is pretty much the theme for Thursday.  It's only notable cause Dennis was there).  We played some Naruto Taisen 4 and Guitly Gear and even a Perfect Dark match, which was 9-10 Dennis.  Though I killed myself once or I would have won.  Anyway, at some point we went to Taco Cabana, but I didn't eat anything.  We came back to my place after.  Eventually, we started the D&D, while the rest of the non-players played Guitar Hero.  I need to get Mary to take that back.  People keep playing it when I want to do something else with that TV.  Anyway, as usual, we gave Dennis a really hard time but had a ton of fun.  Andrew and Matt's characters got pushed around by low level characters that Dennis intended for us to push around.  Me and Soc made fun of them.  The low level characters cowered in fear of Shino, and Faelar didn't even see them.  Silly Banites.  Anyway, so we stopped for hte night at like 2 because we had to leave in the morning.  I slept on the couch, so Dennis and his girlfriend could sleep together comfortably.  

Friday morning I get woken up at like 9:30 by Steve calling for Dennis.  Right after they hang up, Andrew calls me and asks me if I'm ready.  It's me, so of course I'm not.  I tell him I'm about to start getting ready.  So then I put in my contacts, brush my teeth, and me and Dennis watch some videos for like half an hour.  Then, Andrew calls me to cehck on my ready status.  So I hop off the computer and start taking a shower, which Dennis briefly interupts to ask me if he can borrow Disgaea and I'm like ""Uh, no, you live in Detroit."" nad he was like ""cmn"" and I was like ""no"".  Anyway, I get out of the shower, and start getting dressed.  I still haven't packed or eaten, so I start getting out eggs (which I should probably have for breakfast for the next week, so they don't go bad).  As I'm getting the pan out, Andrew Soc and Matt arrive and are like ""We're leaving in 5m inutes"" and I was like ""o rly?"" and Andrew was like ""ya rly"" and I was like ""no wai"".  So I quickly threw the clothes and D&D books and toiltries I'd need into bags and we headed out the door.  I was in shotgun seat the way down.  So we listened to a lot of music, and I'm now an avid Nightwish fan based off their Wish I had an Angel album (which is the name of the song that I've been listening to the entire time I've been writing this entry... great song).  Also some Flogging Molly, Black Mages, and a couple other bands I can't remember the name of.  Not the fan part, the listened part.  Anyway, so me and Andrew are getting pretty pumped about our characters for the Stormrack game in January.  I'm gonna finally get to play Terjon, and he's playing a 2h sword frenzied berserker.  We spent a lot of time discussing how awesome our minimum damage is, and how insane it's gonna be for me trying to stay alive while he's frenzied.  So we get to Houston around 5 (we left at like 11:30 and stopped for like an hour at a Jack-in-the-Box for lunch) and make it to the hotel.  As we're entering Houston, Steve calls and asks if we can pick up his cousin from the airport.  Soc, Matt, and Andrew forgot their dice, so we looked up a comic shop called Third Planet and called them.  First, Andrew asked for directions coming from the wrong location.  So then we had to call em back and ask for directions again.  Then we all (except Soc) heard 59 South when apparently the guy actualyl said north.  So we drive off to the comic shop, figuring we can pick up Steve's cousin later (We told Steve that we wouldn't be getting to him in any hurry) cause teh comic book shop closed at 7 and it was 6 when we re-departed the hotel.  So we drive about 30 minutes until we hit Sugarland.  During this time, Andrew is like ""Oh yeah, I know where Kirby (The street with the comic shop) is.  I remember passing it on the way to Emily's old house.""  and eventually, we pass the street that apparently one would exit to go to Emily's old house.  So we were like ""Andrew, it seems it is not here"".  During this time, Socrates has been insisting that it was supposed to be 59 North we took, not 59 South.  So we call the place back (Andrew and Soc are bickering dangerously close to Andrew getting mad at this point) and they're like ""Yeah, you went the completly wrong way.  Go back this way and get on 59 North""  So we did.  Soc kept being like ""Oh, look who was right"" and me and Matt, sensing that Andrew was getting pretty edgy about it, so we changed the subject forceably.  Anyway, so we get to the comic shop, and it's pretty cool.  I look around, consider getting a few things that I saw there, but figured ""I just spent 600 on a suit, I can't buy stuff right now"" and passed.  The rest of them picked up new dice sets.  So then we go to try and pick up Steve's cousin.  This takes like an hour and a half, because Sam Houston International Airport is a fucking maze of poor design.  When trying to get to your destination, a sign will point you to one lane, then require you to shift like 3 lanes a minute later.  In addtion, the passenger pickup system was choked full of cars and we had to park at the nearby terminal, and then go into the terminal to look for the cousin, who of course, none of us have ever met or even have a description of.  Fortunetly, we have his cellphone, so we called him and discovered airports have terrible cell phone reception.  Finally, we locate him and head back to the hotel.  When we finally return (which almost involved Andrew getting lost again, fortuntetly, I insisted on my directions and we made the epic journey safely).  We got back to the Hotel, and Steve gave us some of the reception dinner food.  Since I don't really care much for pasta, I ordered a delicious pizza and split part of it with Socrates.  So once Dennis and some of the other people that were there for the wedding come back from trying to get to the liqour store (apparently in Houston they close at 9), and I wanted to start up D&D.  But then Emily called and said she'd be all 'tired' or something from driving down to Houston and didn't want to wait up too late at the house for us, adn so Andrew was like ""We'll be leaving in like an hour"" and that wasn't enough time to play.  I should note that we did not in fact leave for at least an hour and a half, though Andrew insists it was only an hour and fiftenn minutes.  So at first I was quite ticked that we didn't play D&D (afterall, I put all that work into making Shino amazing), but eventually we stopped watching Pride Fighting Championships which someone had brought and put on their laptop and started talking instead, cause I assure you, I'd rather play a cut-short session of D&D then watch burly men hump eachotehr and call it fighting.  But the religious and geopolitical discussion did for me.  Of course, Andrew's leash started tugging at him hard (by which I mean she arrived at her house and informed him of this fact and he was like LET US FLY!), and so we left, and went to Emily and Katie's.  We watched some random stuff on TV and we went to sleep.  MAN.  THat was an UNCOMFORTABLE bed.  I wish I'd slept on the couch, but it didn't occur to me till the morning.  So I got up showered and we had donuts for breakfast.  So then we got dressed in our fancy clothes (everyone else was in business casual at best), and we headed for the chapel.  I did get a lot of complements on my clothes, which almost made the price tag feel worth it.  The ceremony was nice, and I confess I felt all peaceful.  The lunch was also delicious.  There were some things that were tasty that I don't know what they were called or what was in them.  Also, there was some good prime rib.  Then there was dancing.  I still can't dance, BTW.  I did cabbage patch like a beast for We are Family though.  Anyway, eventually we left, and went to the comic shop again (still in our wedding wear) and I almost got talked into buying a Colossal Red Dragon miniture cause it was on sale, but I held back once more.  It was close though.  So then we went back to Emily's and rented Advent Children and Memoirs of a Geisha.  We watched Geisha, which was good, I guess, but not spectacular, had a brief break and watched Advent Children, English dubbed.  It was a pretty good dub, I'll say.  Eventually, though, we went to sleep.  This time I split the king-sized bed with Andrew.  As of course is the rule when two guys sleep in the same bed, we sletp as far from eachotehr as possible.  That night's sleep was a lot better of course.  Anyway, so Emily and Katie's parents fixed us breakfast.  It was pretty good, as were most things this weekend.  We left around 1 o clock.  The rest fo the guys wanted to go to the Houston Galleria.  After we'd been driving like an hour, I was like ""So where is this damn mall? It's pretty far out.""  and Andrew was like ""Doh, I forgot we were goign there and just headed straight for Dallas."" Which was fine by me cause it's what I wanted to do anyway.  So we drove for a while, stopping once at Dairy Queen in some speck on the side of the road town.  I had a great butterfinger blizzard.  I was in the back on the return trip.  Anyway, so then eventually we got back to Dallas and we rented Ong-Bak and Night Watch.  We were gonna watch Night Watch today, but it didn't wind up happening.  Anyway, I also rented Dirge of Cerebrus, which is bad, as I had been told.  The gameplay is pretty mediocre to poor, and the story and cinematics aren't nearly enough to make up for it.  So we watched Ong-bak with DM Chris (Courtney was playing Disgaea 2 in the other room) and then went home.  Soc stayed at my place, and we tried out Dirge of Cerebrus.  From what I can tell, I pratcially got halfway through the game last night.  

Anyway, so today I got up at like 2 o clock, played some more Dirge while waiting for Andrew to call us cause we planned to all hang out again today.  Around 6:30 he hadn't called so we called him, and we all went to Chris's and played Settelrs of Catan.  Then I came back here and wasted time I should probably have spent sleeping."

"event","Dennis is so getting rocked this weekend in D&D.  Me and Andrew were discussing stuff, and all the sudden it hit me... I can be an Incantrix.  One of the most amazing Wizard PrC's ever.  NOBODY is gonna cast a spell anywhere near me without me having something to say about it.  And I'm going to make every single buff persistant and Dennis will be like WTF.  I can't wait.  I'm doubly pumped about getting to hang out with Steve and Dennis again AND getting to play Shino again.  I guess triply or more pumped, cause I'm also pumped about the sheer AWESEOMNESS that Shino will bring to the table."

"event","Shit, what should I write about?  Though I've been busy most of the week, not a lot has happened. I don't really understand how that works.  So, I guess I'll go over my week.  Monday was pretty uneventful, went to Naxx, made Grand Widow attempts.  The one thing I'll say for Zissou over OS is that when they schedule boss attempts, we fucking attempt bosses and we attempt em for 4 hours straight if need be.  Tuesday, went over to DM Chris's played his game.  He said outloud that Ben pretty much wasn't coming to his game anymore, and that we've just kind of grown apart from Ben, and that it would be best if we just didn't play D&D with him anymore, but perhaps still hung out in other situations, which is pretty much how me and Andrew have felt for a while.  DM Chris's game still fun.

Wensday, we had the BBQ me and Andrew have been planning and I spent more than I could afford on(thus putting me a bit over on the month of August).  It was great, and we had a lot of fun.  I really meant for it to just be me, Andrew, Emily, Courtney, DM Chris, Chris, Matt, and Soc, and maybe one or two other guests, but we wound up with Ben Morgan, Deanna, John Martone, Ken, Katie, Mary, Teresa, and Robert as well.  Good times were had chilling, and then we went inside and me, DM Chris, Matt, Courtney, and Soc split off into my room to play some D&D that was scheduled for the day (I am very insistent on getting my D&D fixes wherever I can).  After Courtney began feeling tired, she and DM Chris went home and we went out to the living room and hung out with everybody else for a while.

Thursday I slept in from staying up late Wensday, and went to Naxx.  We killed bosses.  SLightly boring, because it's also dangerous, but not really in a fun way.  Apparently everyone else went to see the Descent which got mixed reviews, but mostly just kind of 'it was okay' seemed to be the sum of them.  Everyone but me and Andrew played some card game I don't understand called Phase 10, and me and Andrew went and watched Berserk.

Yesterday? What did we do yesterday... shit, I don't even remember.  I think Soc and Matt hung out with me for a while, and we just hung out, and then Soc and Matt left, and I hung out with Andrew, Emily, DM Chris, and Courtney.  That was pretty fun. We went to Chile's.  I didn't have any money to get anything (on account of the barbeque Wensday), but Courtney bought me a drink.  So we talked for a while, then I got dropped off at home.  Chatted with Robert, Chris, and Tracy for a while.  Went to bed.

Today, slept in late again.  DM Chris and Courtney called me to join them on a round of mall trips, but I was sound asleep.  Got up and worked on my priest for a while, went from L15 to 18 in 3 or 4 hours.  Went and hung out with Soc, Matt, DM Chris, Courtney, Andrew and Emily.  We played Settlers again and Emily screwed me over right at the beginning by beating me to a destination which completly boxed me in.  My one attempt to break out in another direction mid-game was cut off by Andrew.  So I just tried to help Socrates win, but Courtney obtained victory in the end.  I dedicated myself to opposing Emily the entire game though, so I was satisfied to see her victory denied.  We then supped fine alcoholic beverages and watched an Evening with Kevin Smith.  I was then returned to my domicile, and am chatting with Phil on AIM rather than go to bed.

I might go to a Baptist church thing tommrow.  I'm not sure."

"event","So we went to see Snakes on a Plane tonight.  Me, Mary, Dan, Jimraynor (from Ordo), Matt, Baz, and Andrew, that is.  Well, first we played Settlers of Catan at DM Chris's for abit, then headed off to the movie.  So, I guess you probably guessed, there's snakes in this movie, and they make their appearence on a plane.  The movie is pretty freaking hilarious if you go into it with a completly unserious attitude.  It's called Snakes on a Plane for god's sake.  How can some people be trying to evaluate as a serious suspense movie?  Anyway, so we all had a good time during the movie.  Apparently, Sam Jackson is going to be in another movie called Black Snake Moan (we all think the title is just a reference to Snakes on a Plane and suspect that all future Samuel Jackson movies may in some way involve snakes).  Far as I can tell, he finds this mostly-naked white girl outside his house looking like she got all beat up.  He goes aroudn town asking about her, and finds out she sleeps around and lets men treat her like trash or something like that.  So when she wakes up, she's like ""I'm gonna go"" and Sam's like ""wait"" and she gets up, and she's still in her same state of dress, only she has a big chain around her waist.  So we got Samuel L Jackson, with a half naked white girl on a chain in what seems like the south.  I think I see how this movie can be going.  Anyway, afterwords, we went back to my place.  It was kinda odd though, cause me, Mary, Dan, and Jim kinda split into one group to talk, and the rest of our group was kind of seperate.  At 11:30, I had to go to work, of course, so Dan, Jim, and Mary said they'd come with me.  So we get up there and Crumley's locked down.  I'm supposed to page the hall director, who doesn't respond.  After about 15 minutes, we turn around and leave, and then 5 minutes later she calls me, apologizes for not being there, and asks me to come back.  /sigh.  So we drive back up, and she says it's okay if they all come in with me.  So we talked for like the first 45 minutes of my shift, and then they went to play pool.  I'm stuck here at the desk though, don't want to get in trouble for not being at my post (I figure the hall director will let the violation of quiet hours slide since practically nobody is here), chatting on AIM while I wait for them to come back.  Bored."

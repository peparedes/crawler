Seems I'm back to posting once a month here.  Some crazy journal activity that is.  Whelp, I suppose its time for an update...

...I spent the last month making a garden.  It was very cool, i met with the client, made a killer design & plant list (all natives and edibles), acquired all of the materials, and put the sucker in the ground all in one month.  Whoop!  It was super-duper.  It really proved to me that I can do this garden design thing if I want to - and i can do it well and be fine financially - plus have fun and a flexible schedule.  All the same old probs I was looking at in the fall apply, but i am not intimidated by them.  This last garden gave me the confidence and inspiration to push for going into garden design full time independently in the fall.  It all depends on if I can get a couple design and consultation over the next few weeks.  Then I can begin installation in the fall.

I also in the middle of the installation, because my schedule was so flexible, was able to help out with Neverwas for Maker's Fair.  Very fun, the Haul is finally together enough that I was able to actualy enjoy myself this time, relax, and have fun.  I also (and this was in the same weekend as Maker Fair - a little too action packed) had the garden I did for Janette and Mary on the Bringing Back the Natives Garden Tour.  Very fun, had 205 people come by the garden - a non-stop stream of people all day.  It was great to show the garden off and share it with people, it looked fabulous - and again, like Neverwas, after all that hard work I finally got to enjoy myself and the work I had done.  Crossing my fingers that I get some work out of this...

I am now back at the CMA as a receptionist again - sort of secretly, as the CMA hired me without the knowledge of the Temp ag. so as to avoid the completely unreasonable fee they wanted to charge for buying out my contract.  I am a temporary full-time employee - I have benefits in a month - first time ever.  I can leave in august if I want.  Its been a little nerve wracking.  My supervisor emailed me today suggesting I be as discreet as possible because a couple of people came by and asked our security at the building's front desk if a liz simpson worked in the building while I was away over the last month.  I have a good relationship with the Dwayne, the security man, and asked that he not tell people I am here if anyone asks because I'm trying to keep a 'low profile'.  Then today Robert Half Int. (Office Team is a division of R.H.I. that I worked thru as temp.)called multiple times today from 3 different numbers - nobody asked for me from Robert Half, they were asking for other people in the office.  I think its just a coincidence, seems they are scouring for new work opportunities becasue the economy is what it is right now.  But it was sucky, and after the first call from these numbers I stopped picking up - and they would keep calling back, and I kept not picking up.  The weird thing was that sometimes the caller ID would list the call as 'Unavailable', sometimes as Robert Half from the same number. Ugh.  Apart from that, being back here is pretty relaxing - like being on vacation really.  I feel like my month 'off' was really my month 'on'.

In august i think I'll take off and go to Burningman again - I can't believe it, totally thought I wouldn't go, but then my long-time friend Andy expressed interest in going, and then my cousin Leah too.  Two people you'd never think would go to BM - but I know would have a blast.  I want to make sure they get out there and be there to see it.  After BM I'm going to go back east.  Ideally i'd like to spend a few days in Michigan to see the pregnant Tania and Dan, and Isaac's grandma Deena, and the rest of my Mich peeps.  Then I'll head over to NY, spend time with my grandparents.  Then the icing on the cake would be to go down to NYC for some adventures.  Coming back out here I'd like to jump into doing Gardens, but if I can't get that together, i'll come back to the CMA.  Who knows.  I'm going to begin being more active about finding gardening gigs - making a business card and a website...wowee...

So NYC is still in my sights, but it is a little ways off.  I've been joking and saying that I'm waiting for my cat to die.  Which is sort of true - I don't want to leave the garden I'm living in so she can have the happiest days possible for the remainder of her life.  The hyperthyroidism she was diagnosed with will shorten her life-span, but I imagine she'll be around another 2-5yrs.  I feel like the best treatment for her condition is the garden, and that a little apartment in NYC and little access to me would make her miserable and be very difficult for me too.  So I'm staying put here for now.  I plan on saving $ and making art, building up my savings account and my portfolio so that when I do go to NYC I will be ready.  Man-o-man I'm craving the action of NYC.  I want to get there while I am still young enough that being poor and struggling will still be an adventure when I go.  Who knows, maybe when I go there I'll go to school and get my MFA.  Who knows - for now, I'm going to take it easy, make money, make art, maybe make gardens, and just enjoy life here while I dream of NYC.  I've got my tendril of intention wrapped firmly around it."

"event","I'm really getting frustrated by all of the hype that is being thrown around about the cost of food increasing because of crop-land being converted to producing biomass for ethanol instead of food.  Its absolutely incredible that some very important points are being missed:

A) It takes more fuel to grow the crops and process them into biofuel than is actually generated from the process. 

Using our current industrialized agricultural methods that consume vast amounts of petroleum products in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel to operate farm machinery to plant, distribute pesticides/fertilizers, harvest, and transport the crops in combination with the energy required to process and refine the biomass into biofuel - plus burning fuel to transport the biofuel - the ultimate carbon footprint for producing biofuel will never even come close to breaking even if we continue with current methods of production.

B)  There isn't enough land available on the planet to grow the required biomass to be converted into biofuels to produce enough fuel to cover our energy needs based on our current dependency on fossil fuels.

It is kind of appauling that these obvious issues aren't being looked at.  Its comforting to me that we have the knowledge and technologies at hand to tackle our energy and food problems.  Makes me angry that we can't really use them.  A big paradigm shift is going to have to happen before we can even begin to be able to use these often elegant, sometimes obvious solutions on a scale that will make one bit of difference.  Its going to be interesting to see how the tide will turn, things cannot go on as they have been, i fear a lot of people will end up pulled under by the undertoe - mostly the poor, middleclass (could be the end of the middle class...hmn) and people in developing countries will take the real hit.  The elaborate wasteful way we've been living is going to have to change.  This could be a graceful change - as many alternatives are simple and gentle - but probably not, when the bubbles really start bursting I think its going to be pretty bloody awful.  

Perhaps we'll have a hybrid of both if people start waking up and looking at certain realities behind whats really driving these problems.

'The Omnivore's Dilema' by Michael Pollan is a really accessible way to get a window into the perverted way food is produced in the States.  Well written and looks at the problems from some very interesting perspectives.

The documentary 'King Corn' is another piece to the food puzzle.  

Both look at food production and the real causes behind our food shortages - which are terminally linked to our dwindling fossil fuel supply.  I liked that Pollan and the creators of King Corn approach the subject from the inside so as not to alienate or make their audience feel on the spot - they are in the same boat we all are in."

Baby praying mantis are hatching out of eggs buried in my sheets, thier little yellow bodies emerge and climb up my skin single file in an unbroken golden chain that expands in width as the insects mature. They dig sharply into my skin as they climb slowly and steadily, I cannot shake them off.

I am picking leeks and tomatoes in a garden of mine that had gone fallow.  The translucent golden tomatoes hang from a vine growing up a chain-link fence.  The mango shaped and sized tomatoes at the bottom are all rotten, i feel each tomato to see if it is good, all are squishy and fermented at first and then become firmer towards the top of the fence where they are perfectly ripe. I reach to pluck my first tomato and am faced with the piercing amber eyes of a goat. I hesitate and look closer I realizing that the creature is actually a goat-woman who stand guard over the fruit.  I apologize to the goat woman.  Her clear, golden gaze is powerful and beautiful."

"event","A long time ago I had a dream that my house was burning down.  It was my parent's house in Michigan.  I dreamed that as I was getting ready to jump out the window I had to make a choice: I could either bring with me my family photo album, or my binder of negatives - the archive of all my personal creative work.  I could only bring one with me and had to decide which one fast as I couldn't bring both.  I don't remember which one i chose as I  leaped out the open window escaping the curling flames that consumed my house.

I feel like I am forced to make a similar decision now.  How can I even decide between the two?  Both are equally important: my life, myself what is right for me - and the lives of my grandparents and my connection to them. 

The most important thing to me in my life is the quality of connection that I make with other people - I value relationships that are sincere, direct, have depth and a dynamism that encourages the individuals to grow together in a way that is based on exchange, inspiration and encouragement that is reciprocal.

Fuck.

To go and be present with my grandfather as he bows out of this world - to help make that passage as graceful as possible, and to support my grandmother as she loses her lifepartner...

It doesn't matter that they have openly despised each other as long as i have known them - they still love each other and have relied on each other for the vast majority of their lives.  They are scared.  I would like to help them leave each other on the best terms possible.  I would like to know them, as the more that I know my family and the people who shaped me as i grew up, the more i know myself.

And here, for my own life - what do I need to do for myself? What is the most important thing for me? What do I want to do for my own life?  Make art. Find a future in NYC. Take responsibility and care for the commitments that i have made."

"event","Okie Dokie.  So it took three weeks before i find myself doing everything within my power to not chew another nail off absentmindedly as i wait for each minute of the last hour of this friday to tickdown on the clock.

Ack.  I couldn't focus enough to write a convincing letter of intent for the Teach for America Application that is due tonight at midnight.  Maybe i'm not convinced yet that it is something i want to do.  I spent a fair amount of time on the TFA website while a little hyped up on caffiene and refined sugar and started having sentimental reactions to the stories i was reading about kids and their teachers lives beeing changed forever by TFA.  I had dejavu back to the days of getting teary-eyed over cat food commercials on tv while pms-ing.  

Things are going just fine, i'm just understimulated and underslept. My new housemate Roger magically appeared last night fresh from Pheonix - his arrival made the lovely Rebecca magically appear too.  It was lovely, rebecca brought champagne, i made tasty food - wonderful. I'm so glad that Roger has chosen to move in - he is a really great person - and i'm so happy that he is seeing Rebecca too. Coolness.

My car is magically dissapearing today too.  Yay easy donation process!

Checking things off my list, one by one.

All i need is that other subletter and i'm gone. 

Tonight i'm catcing a plane to LA to do the couple of things there that i felt like i couldn't leave california with out doing.  I'm spending time just hangin out with my cousin Leah mostly, with a trip to the Museum of Jurassic Technology where i'll meet up with Andy and see how much his brain has expanded from getting his PHD in neuroscience at UCLA.  It'll be a great weekend.  

I'll feel better as soon as i get up from this desk i'm chained to.  

It feels good that everyone in my office really likes me and wants me to stay.  If i can't find a subletter soon i'm going to think seriously about approaching Christina about hiring me directly for a couple of months so i can make more money - i think it'll amount to about the same cost to the cma, so i don't really see what difference it makes to them as long as i stay for a couple of months to make the direct hire worth the $1,000 fee they have to pay to the temp agency.  One thing holding me back is that i don't know how it will effect my relationship with the temp agency...there are others out there, just don't know if this would reflect badly and make me even less appealing to the temp world - the woman has next to zip office experience and bolts as soon as the agency finds her a job...

I'm truly only making enough to cover my bills and rent thats about it.  I may need to attempt this direct hire out of necessity.  But - that is balanced by wanting to keep a good relationship with this temp agency.  Temping is a total rip, but it did land me some work when i couldn't get anything on my own.  May be useful in NYC."

"event","My supervisor has noticed that I can do more than sit and look pretty while answering the phone and has asked me to come up with a little interior planting design for the office.  She has also offered Isaac and I space to install one of our tie pieces.  Christina is super cool.  As i have been doing my research for office appropriate plants, i have stumbled upon a whole world of interior plantscape design that i had no idea existed. While i was looking up Philodenderon cultivars - a totally low key office dweller, i happened upon its grand-daddy-momma relative:

Alocasia robusta 
This is THE absolute largest undivided leaf in the plant kingdom. The final height in optimal conditions, a staggering 22 ft.

I think that would fill the space nicely ontop of some of the filing cabinets down the hall..."

"event","At my temp job one of the highlights of my day, or rather, one of the most stimulating things that is asked of me is to recieve and open all of the incoming mail.  Through this, I have learned that both the Alameda Congestion Management Agency and I are being totally ripped off by the temp agency we are working with.  I discovered that while I make a whole non-living wage of $13/hr., the temp agency charges the CMA $22.10/hr. for my winning smile and friendly phone presence.  Between the cut that the temp agency takes and what taxes consume, I make less than half of what the CMA is charged by the temp agency for my services.

Holy fucking shit.

You think that they could add a whole extra $2 to my hourly so i could actually buy food with money i actually have instead of putting it on an ever expanding credit card debt.

What a fucking rip off.

I expected that they took a cut, but this is criminal.

Plus, i also found out that if the CMA decided to hire me directly they would be charged a minimum of $1,000 if they chose to hire me in the next 6 months.

Wow. I knew that there had to be a catch somewhere with the temp agency 'magically' finding work for me, but this is more than i expected."

"event","Oh man, my coworker Patty gave me a couple packets of
instant Vietnamese coffee - i was dubious, as i
typically avoid instant anything.  As an experiment, i
just tried it, and oh man, its great - its like candy
with a caffeine punch.  I'm certainly going to have to
limit my consumption.  BTW in case i didn't mention it, I am now the receptionist for the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency. This is the perfect job for me right now and i'm very happy to be here.  Wish that it paid just a little more, but hey, everyone in the office is really nice and the job is very low key.  I get to sit and be pretty (i'm wearing make-up and nice clothes instead of dirt and thread bare threads) and be nice to everyone - i'm loving all the social interaction, its great.

""Good morning, Alameda County CMA, Liz speaking, how may i help you?""

If you ever need a laugh, you should call 510-836-2560
anytime m-f 8-5 (i take an hour lunch at 12) to get a
sample of my 'phone voice'.

On the train to work I saw a rainbow created by the
rising sun on the fog.  I couldn't believe that it was
real at first, i thought it must have been some funny
trick with the polarized glass of the windows.  The
lady behind me saw it too and we ended up having a
nice conversation.  I told her about the moon-bow Jynx
saw one night.  Man it feels good to be out interacting with
people again.  I truly think that a lot of my
introverted tendencies are a learned default behavior
and not really me or who i want to be.

Wowey, so I made a point to figure out where my
polling place was last night and to get there early so i could
try and figure out how to get a new ballot. I'm a permanent mail-in
voter but didn't declare a party and my mail ballot
said that i could vote for the democratic party if i
wanted to but my ballot only had local measures and
propositions, no prez. candidates.  I went to my poll
and the nice ladies there said that i could get a new
ballot if i surrendered my old one (so i couldn't vote
twice).  I went back home and of course, couldn't find
my ballot - looked everywhere, including the recycling
and concluded that in my frustration that i must have
thrown it out a while ago.  So i didn't vote - boo! I
was actually prepared this time and did research etc.
- crazy thing is that i found my ballot this morning. 
Oh well, as i suspected, Clinton got the nomination
anyway.  I feel like we're fucked
regardless.  I'm even pessimistic enough to say that i
think we're gonna end up with McCain because this
country isn't ready for a female or black prez. I
always felt like we were in a big mess and that there
wasn't much to be done about it.  Now that i know a
little more about what is going on my suspicions are
certainly confirmed - at least now i sort of know why.
Jynx is totally right about having to keep a sense of
humor about it all.  I started a lively political
debate yesterday when i accused someone in the office
of voting for McCain - you would have been proud of me
- it was really funny, it drew a bunch of people in
and created a little crescendo of political
discussion.

I feel like i've been on fire the past couple of weeks.  I started a new job, and have been really getting my shit together for leaving.  I even felt like i had enough energy to follow up with someone who asked me out on a date earlier in january.  I realized that i had nothing to lose to check things out, i'm pretty tired of being lonely.  It started out fairly well.  I saw the guy a couple of times, even had him over one night (!).  I feel pretty good about the whole encounter.  From the start I was very clear
about my situation and drew my boundaries.  I told him not to get too attached to me and when i felt like he was, and things were also feeling too intense for me right now with everything going on I met up with him and told him that I needed to call things off.  I was sad to end things, but i was looking for something more casual than what was happening. I'm glad i
gave it a try, we both had a good time. I think that
the experience was good for both of us - i think it'll
be hard for him at first, but i didn't let things drag
on and broke things off pretty fast when i felt that
things shouldn't go further. I'm excited about this whole dating thing.  Its neat, glad i'm finally not afraid of it anymore.  I'm feeling adventurous these days..."

"event","I am mesmerized by the croaking cacophony created by the froggie orgie happening in the pond outside my window.  I've been waiting since May to hear this.  The first time I was in the garden Joe mentioned how sometimes the frogs were so loud that he couldn't sleep at night.  Frog song that loud in Oakland?  I had to hear it myself to believe it - and now that i hear it, it is unbelievable.  The frog song dream come true of my frog catching little girl self! A part of me, a very old part of me is in heaven.

I wait and listen for those special moments, the big silence that follows after the multitude of voices all call spontaneously at once, it lasts only for an instant, and then the rolling layers of vibrating frog song carry the quiet moment away.

Oh song of my heart!

Maybe later i'll go out there and see if i can relax enough to give into it, and let go of the roiling details of my transitional life dissolve into the chorus of my froggie friends.

This is a very special thing.  This is why I am here in this house, home to a garden full of frogs.  A very special place.  Can i give it up in 6 months when my lease is up?

Details evolving: my grandma, as everyone hoped, is warming up to the idea of me coming out to stay with her.  Nori has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, a common ailment of older cats that will require daily maintenance - this will make finding her another home even more difficult - maybe i won't find her a home and will end up finding a way to take her to NYC with me.  I'm going to finish my application for Teach for America and see where that goes.  MY landlords are ok with me subletting out the house as long as they get to meet and are comfortable with the subletters.  Roger, subletter #1 has maybe found subletter #2.  I'll leave for NY either around my birthday or the 1st. of March depending on when subletter #2 is located and approved. I will keep my lease and get my deposit back July 31st and move to NYC at that time, or move back out here and be garden queen if i get lots of work opportunities through the garden tour and end up missing gardening and california after spending time in the tundra of upstate NY.

And so it goes.  We'll see if some work turns up over the next couple of weeks..."

"event","So here's the current situation i'm looking at...

The situation with the escape hatch is in a state of conflict at present.  The red lights flashing and family members running around waving their arms trying to convince my grandmother that her ship is sinking as she stubbornly says that no red lights are flashing and there is no heaving sea outside and there is no hole in the bottom of the ship and everything is fine fine fine doesn't really surprise me.  I've pushed the red button on her life and she is in denial of the reality that she is finally being forced to face.  My grandma is not good with reality.  I think she has never really had to deal with it before and has never really had to grow up in a lot of ways.  I expected and hoped my whole family across the board would be in support of someone going in and helping my grandma. Specifically with that person being me, any rational person could see that me going to stay with my grandma is a mutually beneficial situation where we would be helping each other.  She thinks that she can take care of herself - which is totally batty, even she knows that that isn't true. My Aunt said she was going to try to give her the Big Hard Talk tonight.  I will see how that went in the morning.

Yesterday my Grandma had a very long day.  She drove herself off the road in the morning before going to a friend's memorial service, then I called and asked if she would be open to me coming and staying with her for a while so i could help her out and also get ready to move to NYC.  I knew about the memorial service, but not the car accident - I would have waited till this morning at least if i had known.  I think it was just too much for one day, she was moved by my offer, but i could feel her mind closing off to me as she said she needed time to think about it.

I think that accepting help from me means accepting the reality of her situation: that her husband is dying in the hospital, and that she is in no condition to keep living on the farm by herself at this time.  That she is losing control, and that things will be changing in big and scary ways very soon.  She wants to hold onto her independence and her way of life which has remained virtually unchanged for as long as anyone can remember.  I think she also secretly feels like she is finally free, no kids, no husband, and wants to enjoy her freedom despite the loneliness and isolation she must feel - and the fact that she isn't able to take care of herself.

I began making preparations to leave today.  Looks like the worst case scenario is panning out because it is the most realistic.  Things started out well, i started with seeing if the two possible roomates would want to live in the house together without me. Roomate #1, Roger is putting a check in the mail for feb. 1st rent, is ok with living with someone other than me in the house, and was open to looking after Nori as a new home was found for her.  Roomate #2 said no right away.  

Then I tried calling my lead on finding Nori a home.  That did not go as well as planned.  Finding Nori a home will be very difficult.  I called my cousin in Arizona and she would take Nori but i'd have to come up with a $600 pet deposit and also pay $20 extra a month for pet rent, also Nori would have no outdoor access and would be pent up in a boring apartment.

If I try to leave by feb. 1st I will have to break my lease and potentially deal with a very painful situation with Nori. Not to mention, my Grandma is stomping her foot and pouting, and doesn't really want me to come at this time.

The family thinks that she would warm up to the idea if she were given a little more time.  

Yesterday I had a beautiful day at my favorite beach with Jenny and came home feeling confident and positive about going to live with my grandma and that any obstacles (including my obstinate grandma) could be overcome.  I felt like i needed to look at the negative side more and so i went out to see Sweeney Todd with Jared.  Towards the end of Tim Burton's dark and bloody musical I heard a little voice in my head that said, ""I don't wanna live with my nasty grandma"" - which is true, she can be pretty ugly  at times.  Glad I heard that little voice, needed to balance out the optimistic, idealistic cheerleaders in my head.

At this point, i'm feeling like I should give my grandma and myself more time.  My current thought is to take Roger as a housemate.  I'll use next month to find another subletter to live with Roger, cross my fingers that the temp work will turn something up, start finding Nori a home and give my grandma some more time to think.  This way, I don't have to break my lease, I have someplace to keep Sarah's furniture, and there will be 6 months to locate a new home for Nori.  I would leave as soon as there was another subletter.  Or if my grandma is being particularly resistant or says flat out no, or I can't find another subletter, I'll stay here for 6 months, finish up my lease, struggle with the work stuff, and go to NYC after July 31st."

I will miss my favorite fruit which has always been and will always be, Isaac.

Tomorrow I will decide if I take the escape hatch. I wrote a list of all the things i need to do if i take off by feb. 1st.  It doesn't even fill a whole page.  That feels really good."

"event","Well, well.  I gots me a vibrating kitty in my lap, miso soup, pomegranate, and persimmon in my tumm, and peppermint tea going down,
down,

down.

Feeling much better.  The eye twitch has abated for the moment.  Stirring some pots and poking the fire is actually getting something cooking...

I have viable options:

2 possible roomate choices

1 possible escape hatch

The real question is: do i stay for awhile or do i go stat?

Some compound questions are:

Do i decide to commit to a roomate, choose a roomate, stay for 6 months, make art with isaac and keep stirring and poking the fire to see if a job magically appears to save my remaining days in cali and build a little something for my resume to work towards  a Temp/office life in NYC to buy me time there to find the job i really want? 

Do i say to hell with the Temp crap, contact Rick, tell him that the Temp crap is crappily not panning out, ask if he's got some work for me, advertise myself on the Natives Garden Tour website and work gardens for the next 6 months to 'save money' and say to hell with consistent work and NYC resume building any then go in august?

*or*

Do i take the escape hatch and immediately unload the majority of my stuff (including potted plants and Nori :(, keep only what fits in my car, put Sarah's furniture in storage, break my lease feb 1st, get behind the wheel, point myself due East and end up at my grandparent's farm in Bliss NY to take care my my deteriorating Grandmother while my Grandfather passes away in the hospital?

Is this something that will drain the living daylights out of me or will it be a difficult but inspiring, healing experience that I feel good about the rest of my life, by helping the family in a Big way, get to know my grandparents while i still can, perhaps make a little art, and be in a position to launch myself into NYC when the time comes in a couple or a few months depending on how long my grandpa lasts, it takes my grandmother to recover, and i patch together a viable living and working situation in NYC?

Escape Hatch or Planned Departure?

Does either one lessen my chance for a crash landing in NYC?

Why am I so afraid of a crash landing, why can't i be confident of a smooth landing?

Do I choose a more moderate approach, say good bye and thank you but see ya later to cali in a reasonable and financially independent way?

Do I abandon ship, take the financial oars offered by my family and paddle ashore to an island with a couple lost souls, perform CPR on one, a burial at sea for the other, make a new life raft and then SOS myself over to NYC? 

Will i get lost on the desert island too?

"event","I had a really nice evening spending a little time with my roomate a couple nights ago.  Its funny, we have been living together for a month and a half and the longest time we spent together was when she came by to see about renting the room.  I made a tasty curried dinner and we chatted.  She is less conventional than i thought and a lot cooler than she let on at first.  We don't have a lot in common other than randomly she is in the same circle of friends as Isaac is circling in now.  Turns out she is going to move in with her boyfriend come february.  I'm sad to see her go not just cause its nice to have someone help with the rent, but she is a great roomate, very considerate and affable.  Hope things work out for her.

Roomate search round 2!

I then woke up in the middle of the night and remembered the most intense dream.  My brain finally felt comfortable letting go of some tension its been carrying around.  A very very long dream, it took me 45min. to share it with Jynx so i'll spare you the details unless you are interested (let me know if you are, it was a great dream - hey Tania! i'm goona be at the Detroit airport for a couple hours on lay over on my way to NY Monday, come and hang out with me, there will be more than enough time to tell you my dream and eat some over-priced airport food!)

When i woke up i felt as clear headed as i've felt in a long time.  I also had an inspired idea come to me as to how to resolve a problem with the changes i've been making with Janette and Mary's garden.  They are the coolest btw.  I was feeling a little shaky in the morning, with the eye twitches and all about the roomate searching and the work and money and moving thing and christmas time too.  Went to work in the garden, tried out my dream inspired idea and it was just what i needed to do - the garden looks so great with the changes i'm making i can hardly believe it.  Makes me feel like i'm a real garden designer - i can do it!  As the sun set and i was recovering from rolling around many more than 10 large boulders i admired the changes i was making, Janette and Mary came out to give me something.  the something turned out to be an Ipod Touch! Holy shit and i was just happy with them letting me make all the changes to the garden.  J & M truly are the coolest.

I think its the nicest gift anyone who isn't related to me or dating me has ever given me.  

Here is a question for you, dear reader: What was the nicest thing (price tag excepted) someone who you weren't related to or dating gave you out of the blue?

And here is a synopsis of the dream:

I was a vampire and learned to restrain my insatiable desire for blood.  When I learned to control myself I discovered beauty and strength.

P.S. please tell Santa that i need a new roomate for feb. 1st!

P.P.S. Happy solstice, the darkest days are behind us!"

"event","Ah, the thermal vampire has become better friends with ye ole' hotwater bottle. The poor thing has been sitting lonely, and forgotten for some time now - then Jynx spoke of its inexpensive and long lasting warming virtues.  One of the nicest things anyone ever gave me was the little space heater that Matt, bless his heart, gave to me out of pity when we broke up.  With being so broke i've been trying to not pay extra to PGE this winter.  Sarmad  is in NYC, and my kitty really isn't as warm as you might think a fuzzy muffin like her might be - so this modest little hot water bottle has really come in handy.  It even pre-heats my side of the bed if i tuck it in a bit before i hit the hay. It also stays warm till morning and it doesn't even try to steal the covers in the middle of the night!

The other revelation recently shared with me was from the lovely Jared.  He bestowed the virtues of Pandora Radio late the other night after the dinner party.  Its really a pretty neat thing if you haven't heard of it.  You create 'radio stations' by plugging in an artist or a song or a combo of these into the website and it creates these great play lists of songs that are similar to the sounds you like.  A great way to discover new music.  Check it out:

www.pandora.com

I've been using limewire to download the new music that comes up that i like and have now downloaded over 2,000 songs from limewire over the last year for a total of 6.4 whole days of non-stop music listening.  Whoa there...

"event","I woke up this morning, cozy in my bed, tired, and happy.  I realized that it feels like the holidays this morning.  There is something about waking up in bed, cozy and warm, with the central heat in the house blowing out of the vents and knowing that its chilly outside, but i'm warm inside.  I usually don't leave the heat on at night in california cause of the cost and it usually doesn't get too cold at night.  In the East you have no choice but to keep it on or freeze to death in your sleep.  I haven't lived in a house with good central heating   in the winer in a long time.  I'm tired because i worked a 5hr. day yesterday using a pick to tear roots out of the dirt and then stayed up past 1am - I'm happy because I was up that late with friends sitting around drinking tea made from fresh spearmint from my garden and eating cookies just hanging out, talking in my home.  I had the sweetest dinner party last night with Jynx, Janette and Mary, and Jared.  I made a lovely kabocha squash curry, broiled keiffeir lime shrimp, and a salad with pomegranate, persimmon, almonds, and avocado with a ginger miso dressing.  We had wine and squashy cheese and ice cream and my mom's cookies shipped in from michigan that day.  Having a sampling of close to a dozen different kinds of my mom's cookies really emphasized the holiday cheer.  There is nothing better than combating the darkness and cold outside by bundling up, eating extra calories and getting cozy with friends late into the night."

"event","I've been having a slew of vivid dreams lately.  for the most part, they have been beautiful, inspiring and sometimes even revelatory.  A couple of nights ago i dreamed that i remembered how to fly.  As I gracefully soared thru the air i stretched every muscle completely, taking delight in not holding anything back in my body or mind.  I just soared and soared. Occasionally I would get a little tired from the flying and would drift back down to earth for a brief breather only to take flight once more to delight in being airborne. I woke up in the middle of the night and was extra happy to remember the dream because i have had only a handful of flying dreams that i can dimly remember.  When i woke up in the morning i had a melody in my head, a clear and simple series of repeated tones that i remembered singing in another dream while also flying again.  This second dream of flight was even more joyful than the first, it was so exhilarating - an uninhibited expression of exuberance and happiness. 

Last night I had my first nightmare I can remember having in a long time.  I dreamed that I was sleeping in my bed and that a demon broke into my house.  I could feel it drawing closer, creeping quietly nearer, and nearer. I was asleep in the dream and unable to do anything but wait, feeling trapped in my sleeping body.  The creature crept onto the bed and crawled over my body to sit on top of my chest and watch me sleep.  I could feel its weight pressing down on me.  It was a sniveling and wretched creature that embodied everything despicable about human nature. The miserable thing was both pitiful and terrifying.  I was completely defenseless, waiting for the demon to do whatever evil thing it had in mind. I woke up in the dream with electric thrills of terror shocking thru my body.  I couldn't see the demon, but could still feel its presence for a few seconds before waking up in reality at 3am with the same jolts of panic and fear as in the dream.  Pretty horrible, my heart was pounding and my mind racing.

I remembered a painting that came up in an art history class years ago by fuseli:


<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lady_labrynthe/pic/0000t7kg/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lady_labrynthe/pic/0000t7kg/s320x240"" width=""299"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

I was less waif-like and the demon more gollum-like - i guess this image stuck with me.

The demon felt like it was part of me and also separate from me too.  It certainly felt like a visit from one of Jung's archetype's of the collective unconscious. I did some thinking about where this nasty little familiar fellow came from.  I think he's been sitting on me more often than i'd like to admit to myself.  I've got some work to do before i can remember how to fly and sing clearly."

"event","Wow, 3 posts in 1 day, i suppose its feast or famine here.  Speaking of food, I went to see 'King Corn' today - excellent, i highly reccomend it to anyone who eats food or cares about anyone else they know who eats food too - specifically food produced in the US.  Turns out the average american life span is actually decreasing...and its all because most americans are made of corn...strange, but true.  Check it out!

www.kingcorn.net

I tried a transportational experiment today in anticipation of the death of my car.  I went to see 'King Corn' at the Landmark Shattuck in Berkeley without driving my car.  It took me 3x as long to get to and from there.  The walk to the Bart from my place is 40min.  There is a 10min. walk to a bus stop that'll get me there but the bus leaves every hour on weekends and ends at 7pm, during the week its a little better, leaving every 1/2hr.  Then dealing with Bart took another 40min. or so (and thats not having to wait 20min. for the train to appear).  I'll give it a go with my bike next time.  Fortunately there is a bike shop nearby so i can get the tires inflated on my bike, buy a proper lock and bike light (my funds are extra low, anyone know of any extra locks or lights floating around, i could borrow?).  One thing thats sucky about trying the bike/bart combo is that if i get a temp job in the city i can't take my wheels with me on the train during rush hour, looks like i'd be able to if i stay in the east bay at least.  I discovered a little organic grocery store 10min. away from my house on the walk (yay! food covered) and a place to buy fish too.  There is a bank close to the fruitvale Bart i can go to also.  Looks like I'll be ok to be mobile without my car.  It won't be great, but its certainly do-able.  

Next bit of research is to look into what i need to do to donate my car.  Then it'll be time to break the car-less news to Rick and tailor my resume to apply with a temp agency.  Wow.  Its happening.  I'm transitioning. It feels good to get ready to make these changes.

Its funny, I overheard a conversation on the Bart where this California native guy was comparing the NYC public transit to our Bay area crap.  He just got back from living in NYC for a time and missed paying $2 to get anywhere, trains that show up regularly and run all night and simply a system that makes sense and is actually more convenient to use than driving a car.  I laughed to myself as i read my free 'Open Exchange' hippy-dippy magazine.  The Bay area is such a big fat contradiction - yes i'm being extreme here.  I just think its ridiculous that this place is full of tree-huggers and zen-consumers and it has such a crappy public transit system to the point where it makes more sense for so many people to drive a car out of practicality.  For the people who aren't so poor they have no choice, choosing not to drive can almost elevate a person to a special green martyr status.  I'm being crusty and cranky here, i'm just so irritated with this culture of eco-self-consciousness.  It really puts me off that people go too far with the eco-green-spiritual culture, to the point where they look down on people who don't make as 'responsible' choices as they do or are just simply so fanatic about it that they turn more mainstream people off. They are exclusive without even realizing it, and wonder why everyone is so ignorant or crazy to not be more 'green' that they don't notice that they are frothing at the mouth.  Or rather they don't go far enough or go in the wrong direction, getting sucked into all these spiritual self-healing contrived mushed up versions of 'zen' this and 'feel your chakras' that. Its all about the energy man, and the wheat grass, put your head in the healing circle and shake it all around, thats what its all about!

I feel like this could potentially lead to some reactionary art making on my part.  Try to point out to the hippies what dip-shits they are being and maybe make some yuppies realize that they are being irresponsible jerks. Jesus am I crusty tonight.  

Its just so challenging to be conscious of one's impact in the world.  How can you step lightly and cause the least harm to yourself and others?  How can you be realistically responsible as a consumer?  Is it even possible to try and make a difference, or push towards something better for the future?  People aren't happy, hippies and obese SUV drivers alike.  I really have a lot of compassion for all these lost souls, I feel like I'm one of them, and I'm not coping with our reality all that well either.  such a mess.  Will someone please just pass me the cheetos so I can get type 2 diabetes and die early to escape it all?

mmm...snackies...I think I'll make myself some pop corn and watch 'An Inconvenient Truth' to finish this Sunday off wih the right mix of conflicted feelings."

"event","I found a roomate in the nick of time, her name is Maia and she just moved in yesterday.  She seems like she'll be pretty low key and easy to live with, not my best friend, and not a crazy head - in some ways, potentially the perfect roomate.  It is not clear how long she will stay.  She said at least 3 months to start.  After moving all her stuff in she said that she doesn't want to move again for a long time - i think she has a different sense of time than i do, so we'll see.  I need to clarify things soon though, because i need to make sure that I'm not left in the lurch again trying to cover full rent.  Truthfully, I really can't afford this place if i want to move to NYC.  I moved here anticipating it being tight financially for a while, but I had planned on starting my own business and ultimately making pretty good money once i established myself.  Joe, my landlord is coming by next weekend to help with clearing out the pond.  Ugh, this is a mess, i feel the need to talk with him about what is up, but it is hard when I don't have a clear idea how to approach the general idea of what I see happening:

1) I want to try to move to NYC
2) I do not intend on continuing my lease past July
3) It would be great if I could break it early and not lose my fat deposit
4) I somehow am still attached to this place and don't want to just leave it
5) I want to try out NYC for a couple of months to live and work in the spring
6) I will still have my garden on the Bringing Back the Natives Tour in May
7) I don't want to close any doors in case NYC doesn't feel right
8) I could still try to go for garden design and come back to this house and garden...
9) I could move to San Francisco and do...?
10) It all seems to add up to needing to make a change - how far do I go?

I am hoping to be able to make decisions before fate chooses for me.  The car deities have indicated that my car is not long for this world.  I was thinking about donating it anyway, but it is best to do that before it dies an untimely death.  I have AAA so i'm not completely SOL.  I do not have any money to put into a failing car.  I am hoping it will last out to the end of the month at least - preferably into the new year so i can make changes to Janette and Mary's garden and work a little longer for Rick to hopefully get out of the hole a little financially.  It all depends on the rain and how organized Rick is with work and how long my car lasts.  I don't feel ready to jump into doing temp work quite yet.  I would prefer this transition to not be forced upon me.  I'll be ok either way.  I'd just like to avoid excess drama and difficulty and try to get a litttle more stable financially before making a big change.  

No car = time to inflate the tires on my bike and say hello public transport.

Goodbye gardening and hello sedinatary office work.

I keep thinking about certain details like: how will I get to the bank?  How will i take my cat to the vet?  Should i begin trying to find a new home for her sooner rather than later anyway?

And the list goes on..."

"event","I'm in Rockridge as the shops are closing.  A new cafe has opened with two fountains.  i'm on the phone with Jo describing them to her: one is a simple sheet of water cascading down a tile wall, another around the corner is also a cascade of water but falls in front of a wall. The second is located slightly behind a standard dark plastic soda fountain so as you pour yourself a pepsi or diet coke, it looks like it is coming out of the waterfall.  A mix of sheik trendy design and generic standards. 

I am in what looks like the Oakland Hills but feels like the Sierra.  I'm at Jo's house, she is not home but her husband Greg is.  A creek runs underneath their house.  I find Greg in his workshop talking with a young man with longish dark hair.  We go outside, the weather is cool and softly overcast.  I look into the creek and see a large fish. I'm surprised to see such a big fish zipping around in the clear water near the sandy bottom.  I excitedly point out the fish, I can't tell what kind of fish it is - big enough to be a trout but stockier like an ocean fish.  Greg picks it up and holds the fish in one hand grasping it around the spine near the tail.  It is white, some times black.  The fish and I are equally surprised that Greg is holding it out of the water.  Greg gets distracted and the fish makes a swift get away trotting down a hillside, looking very much like my cat, back into the water.  I realize then that the fish is also the young man Greg was talking to earlier.

Beautiful fluidly shifting images and feelings towards the end of this dream: Greg and young man, fish in the creek, my delight, fish in greg's hand, my surprise, shifting colors, black and white, fish escapes, runs down the hillside, back into the water, my puzzlement, the fish is my cat, the fish is the young man."

"event","Today

I moved 2 mountains of mulch,
Then created a silken chasm of ties.

Afterward I enjoyed a party
Inspired by the full moon.

Sitting, warm, by the fire,
Then in the hot tub.

At the end of it all I find myself,
Smelling of woodsmoke and chlorine,
With the residual taste of pomegranate
And quiet conversation on my tongue.

A full day with a relaxing end,
And yet, the knot of tension persists."

"event","Being poor has forced me to eat all the random things that were hiding in various secret nooks inside my fridge and cupboard.  I happened upon a secret stash of dried fruit when i was desperately seeking a chocolate substitute. Mmmmm...dried mango...almost makes me not miss the chocolate.  It is hard to be committed to eating organically, i may end up starving.  I have all of these associations with food produced commercially to the point i don't even consider it food.  Commercial agricultural practices are destroying the soil, polluting the water and air, causing frogs to grow extra limbs, giving cancer to farm workers that get paid next to nothing...and if it is organic, if its not locally produced all the fuel wasted to get me grapes in february hardly justifies a craving...the list goes on.  

There is a book i've been simultaneously avoiding and wanting to read.  Its called 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' by Michael Pollan (same author of 'The Botany of Desire', also excellent).  I believe it traces the origins of 4 meals: one from a fast food joint, another from a decent restaurant, one where all the ingredients are 'organic', and another where all the ingredients are grown by the author - or something like this combo.  It has caused a couple full fledged omnivores I know who were devoted to meat to become veggie and veggies to reconsider the level of veggie they are comfortable with.  

Its funny. I fell like i'm really aware and responsible with some things, such as how my choices as a consumer impact the larger whole, yet I only recently started to make an effort to read the news and keep track of larger current events..."

"event","This is odd, why can't i sleep?

The occasional insomniac night happens sometimes.  Usually accompanied by a constant slideshow of thoughts, memories, images, with the occasional epiphany when the right juxtaposition happens.   I was really tired when i came home late from the city after working with isaac on our next project.  I put on a DVD, Akira Kurasawa's 'Dreams', that never fails to make my eyes close. As usual, it put me to sleep and sent me straight to dreamland during the Monet dream - i find this one pretty darn cheezey, especially when the music gets all dramatic. At this point i usually wake up and turn the DVD off because i'm sleepie (ohp! side note, i hear rain beginning outside) because Monet reveals to Akira that he cut off his ear because he couldn't paint it properly and then freaks out and wanders off leaving Akira to chase behind him searching for him literally in his paintings.  Its a neat dream, but the delivery is pretty hokey-pokey, especially Monet's weird make up and funny bright orange goatee and hair.

Anywhoo, i ended up staying up and watching up till the post-nuclear apocalypse dream.  The desolate ashen field reminded me of burningman and i realized that i found my memories of burningman more interesting than the film.  I turned it off and rolled over and reminisced thinking i'd fall asleep.  However, burningman bled into other thoughts and the free associative eb and flow decided to go into the realm of the conscious instead of the unconscious and so here i am.

Funny, sometimes when i'm up late like this i feel kinda batty.  Tonight i feel simply awake.  Somehow i ended up with this second wind i cannot account for.  I've got a lot going on but nothing to really keep me awake at night because i feel like i've got a decent handle on things.  I feel calm.  Yet, awake.

I'm going to give another shot at making calm turn into unconscious."

"event","Wow, I guess I kinda dissapeared there for a month.  Sorry for the dissapearance my loyal horde of avid readers.

Ah...

yeah...

Having Sarmad live with me for 2 weeks was pretty great.  We had some pretty intense adventures...especially in a field of willows under the mountains...and on my livingroom floor...but mostly, it was really warm and cozy.  Some stuff came up towards the end that needs to be investigated, but the good was good enough for me to want to get my butt back out to NYC Asap.  Probably not until December. And then...I'm ah, going to go back to do 2 months of intensive, immersive research.  

I've been looking at my life in California from a different place.  Not the happy place i've been selling myself on for 7 years.  From the place that realizes that maybe California isn't a dream after all.  

Many details have been weighed back and forth...forth and back again...then back to forth and i got all confused and a bit depressed and angry and upset with this place and this life for being just so darn beautiful and just so bloody lonely and not what i really expected.

I'm way too isolated out here.

I want to be where the people are.

I want to see.

Want to see then dancing...dammit...

Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I may be moving to the Big City."

A small salad of garden gifts: basil, armenian cucumbers, and sungold tomatoes harvested from my old garden accompanied by accidental early girl tomatoes gathered from a garden in lafayette with fresh mozzarella, dressed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  Armenian cucumbers are my new best friends, beautiful dark green and chartreuse stripes, up to 2 tender feet long without bitterness, humorously curved, and unexpectedly furry - i thought the fuzz would put me off, but no, its quite charming.  Plus easy as pie to grow!

Back to work on editing tie images, i'm making great progress, and have much better material than i thought.  Its good to look at the work isaac and i put out there, we did our best work to date with the ties.  Thoughts of graduate school for art don't seem so far off with strong work like this...

"event","Lets see, I want to get this down before I forget.  So yesterday I had a pretty great day working up in napa with Jane.  the day before in Lafayette was pretty tough with lots of miscommunication mixed with holes to dig filled with very hard dirt and lots of roots, so it was extra nice to have such a lovely work day.  The best part was talking with Jane on the long ride up to the job site and throughout the day.  I've been talking with people lately about their experiences of encountering people that affected their lives greatly.  So far, Jane's story takes the cake big time.  Her story unfolded as we worked.  Here is an image of part of the garden we worked in that she designed - and this is just a tiny piece!


<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lady_labrynthe/pic/0000r8t1/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lady_labrynthe/pic/0000r8t1/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Jane grew up in a teeny town in the middle of Ohio.  She went to a liberal arts school there for fine art, and seeking adventure, decided to take off for NYC to finish the last semester of her BFA.  The summer before this last semester she spent her vacation living with and working as a nanny for a family that lived on an island near Seattle.  One day she was paddling out on the water with her little charges and they were coming around the edge of an island and another boat appeared and Jane felt something was up even before she saw the sailor in the boat.  The kids started getting goofy and capsized their boat and when Jane surfaced feeling rather the fool and largely like a partially drowned feline the other boat had gotten closer and she peered up into the eyes of the handsome captain of the ship and knew 'oh no! i'm in trouble here'.  His name was George and he was a medical student in california, Jane fell fast for him in a way she had never experienced, an attraction both physical, mental, and emotional that transcended anything she had known before.  But when the summer was up she headed back to school and then dove head first into being an artist in the big apple.  

In the city Jane furiously burned the candle stick from both ends.  She had her life as an art student during the day and then after school dodged hot potatoes thrown at her by Andy Warhol and his crew while working until 3am at Max's Kansas City as a waitress.  She rented a small room from a family that lived on the lower east side of manhattan and looked after their two boys.  One night she went out to some hole in the wall steakhouse in the neighborhood to catch dinner.  As she was eating her meal alone an older man asked if he could join her.  He turned out to be Shell Silverstein (yes, the same one that wrote the great kid's poetry and also illustrated for playboy - which i wasn't aware of, i just grew up innocently reading 'a light in the attic').  She actually didn't know who he was, which he found hard to believe, but they hit it off and later in the evening Jane found herself back in his appartment listening to him play the guitar.  Things didn't get too steamy that night, largely because Jane was still in love with the 3,000mile distant George, but it didn't take too long for Jane to feel like it was time to shed her virginity - yes, things were intense with George, but Jane who was considered a 'prick tease' by some, ended up losing her virginity to the one and only Shell Silverstien - and if i didn't think Jane was incredible before, now, it is undeniable.

Yet, Jane was still madly in love with long lost George, and NYC ended up being too much for her in the end so she headed out to the Bay Area, in part to find her love and also to find a more low key life.  She didn't get into specifics but things didn't ultimately work out with George, she had missed her chance and was a little too immature to make things work.  She started her own ceramics studio, married someone else and started a family.  However, she continued to occasionally cross paths with her one true love.  they called eachother once out of the blue.  They met for a drink, George's wife was 1month pregnant, Jane was 2moths pregnant, tehy were both kind of quietly freaking out inside.  One day she and her family were out on the water in the Bay on a sailboat when she felt like something was about to happen.  Off in the distance, the fog parted and a boat sailed out and she knew it was him.  The boat drew nearer, and their eyes met across the distance.  Later their boats docked next to eachother and Jane's 2yr. old son reached out to him to get help out of the boat eventhough they had never met.  Another time his car passed hers and she and her childern waved as they drove on.  

After hearing part of this story halfway through my workday, Jane approached me where i was working with some potted plants and said that Kit Bedford, the owner of the garden, had just had a group through to see the garden the day before.  the group turned out to be George's sailing club so there was a good chance that Jane had just barely missed George yet again.  It was very odd, Jane doesn't keep in touch with him anymore, and i got the impression that she hadn't told their story for a while.  

I asked Jane what she thought of this.  She kind of shook her head slightly and with an enigmatic smile mentioned something about the energy still being strong.

In my own life i have had my own strange moments when planets seem to align and stars begin to cross.  Its hard to know what to make of these moments, they are so hard to take in, yet i feel like i live for them.  sometimes the moments are hard to believe, too good or strange to be true.  I feel torn between my good midwestern sensibilities and all this hippy dippy shit, the two clash pretty severely.  I never really believed in either, i just do my best to live in those moments, and to not try to think too hard about where they came from, or where they are going.  I take it in and let it roll through me. Later I may puzzle over it, or dream about it, but in the end i'm just happy to have had the experience and am thankful for how it has opened me up to the possibilities of the universe.

And a friend popped out to say hi as i was fertilizing containers:

I am the new Lady there, come visit me and i shall feed you peeled heirloom tomatos, fan you gently with peacock feathers and find a comfortable throne for you to sit upon to bask in the glory of the garden with me."

"event","Tonight is my last night with my Fort.  It was really difficult to get myself up here to pack, I'm really goona miss this funky spot!  I truely don't think anybody has ever, or will ever love this little loft space as much as i have over the last couple of months.  I've had to work hard to make this space as fun and usable as it has been, i feel like i'll be bored and spoiled with a room that is a normal room you can actually stand up in and not hit your head on the roof, or can actually sit in a chair placed on an actual floor instead of precariously perched on a slimsy scrap of plywood balanced over the hole in the floor where folding stairs live.  The narrow spot where the roof and wall meet my books all fit perfectly.  Being able to stand up straight in your work space is totally over-rated, having no choice but to be so close to the floor it ended up being like a wrap-around desk.  All the little nooks and crannies to store art supplies and places to put up funny little pictures will be missed, i've had to kiss each and everyone of them good bye with a tear in my eye.

My one regret was that nobody tried to ever invade the Fort.  I never got to thwart the enemy by raising up the drawbridge, or pour boiling oil over the side of my lookout, or shoot arrows thru the sheilding bars, or hold anybody hostage in my dungeon, or even make a fast get away out of my escape hatch if things headed for the worse. 

Poop.

As i was packing and bumming Karen called to tell me that she ended up being an hour and a half late to some wedding or something because she and James (her co-worker and friend in NYC a.k.a. The Picky Little Shit) were brainstorming ideas about a webcast show that would just be me basically living my life and inspiring others to be adventerous about cooking and life in general.  I was so entertained by how entertained they were about entertaining this crazy idea.  Karen mentioned things like: 'A liz world is a better world' and 'Lizspiration'.    The most enteratining thing to me is that James thinks that not only would people be really into me puttering around doing what i do in the kitchen talking about my crazy adventures making tie sculptures and blissing out on plants, but that they would actually spend money to watch me do what i do - it would also be a good way to market the self help cook book i want to do, get people hooked and sell em the book.  It was funny to hear how Karen was interested in the concept just to get people inspired and James is interested in a business money making kind of way.  I guess he really didn't mind when i called him a 'picky little shit' at dinner because his panties were all in a knot about the toasted bread on his sandwich being stale!

And here i was feeling like i just wanted to simplify my life.  Doing these web casts would be a great way to maintain some of the wild momentum i've had this summer with all my various adventures.  

Ack, now Nori is parked in my lap purmewtaing, I don't wanna tear down my Fortress!  

In the end i'm forced to light my own castle on fire.  And Shiva does his little dance, ring around the rosie, we all fall down, and wake up  to something entirely different.  And so it goes."

"event","Tonight I finally caught Britt for a video chat and while we were talking a lot of old friends ended up joining our conversation.  As i was catching a glimpse of Britt's fuzzy kitty Fizgig and waving hi to her husband Josh while we tried to all watch the lightningstorm happening in michigan together, the communication gods must have been pretty energized.  Our friend Ben from high school IM'd Britt to say he and his girlfriend Becca are engaged and getting married next june.  Then Jenny (who I've know since 4th grade) who was running late to come over and help me pack  tonight called to say that another friend from West Bloomfield, Katie and her boyfriend just broke up - a very bad and sad thing.  Then Dan, another old WB bud IM'd to say that his Sister Holly is pregnant (she and her husband have been trying a long time) and so is his brother Darrel's wife too.  All within a 5min. period all these old friends who grew up together in michigan spontaneously shared big news across the ether of phone and interweb spanning thousands of miles of space in no time at all.

Pretty neat!

Ohp! Jenny is here, pack-o-rama!"

It made me sad when he mentioned that it sounds like we'll be seeing eachother likely about 2X per year.  Well, thats more than i see most of the people i love the most on this green and rather large earth.  I hope he makes it out in Semptember when all my crazy stuff has simmered down.  Hopefully it'll still be warm enough to teach him how to swim in Mono lake.  That would be....*.....!......*.........*.*............!............!!!"

"event","Ack! I promised myself that i'd sleep tonight, which i have for a couple of hours but alas, wide awake again in the middle of the night.  I guess i just have a great deal on my plate right now and all the details to attend to pop into my head as soon as i'm the least bit conscious.  I'm not doing a very good job of elliminating details by attending to them, things keep popping up, including more details, and wonderful distractions.  I'm so  glad i went to my friend Laura's bd party insteadof packing and detailing, she's one of the most brilliant and interesting people i met while in school here.  We've always really gotten along so well, another one of those encounters of instant comfortable human exchange that i cherish above all else.  She's really great, just turned 37, she's also doing really great, has made some difficult but important choices for her life since the last time i saw her as i have also done the same.  It was so good to se her so well!  Her daughter Quinn is so neat, she just entered the 7th grade and reminds me so much of Laura, and also of myself.  I don't have much interaction with kids but she has always confirmed to me that yes, someday i would like to attempt to physically bring another person into this world, yeah, i'd like to have a child one day.  It was so strange to realize how high on my list of things to do creating an actual family is - i cherish my chosen family of friends, and the family i was raised with despite the difficulties, but creating my own family, yeah, that is important to me.  Wow.  I think of things like this and all the junk i need to do like call the utility companies and put the utilities in my name for the new house etc., just kinda end up back on their list of things to do.  I met this woman at Laura's party, her name is Elizabeth, we kinda hit it off a bit all with the plan to go ballroom dancing together and all.  She also mentioned that she had recently done some research on procrastination and discovered not only that there were many different kinds of procrastinators, but that she was most of them too.  there are the procrastinators that make endless lists of things to be done and procrastinate by making lists and not doing the things on them - i feel that i am prone to this.  i need to get organized so i make a list, but making the list is so much work that i don't get to work on anything on the list because the lists are so exaughsting.  sometimes i feel like i just need to jump in and start doing with out making a detailed map of what needs to be done so i don't glaze over before even getting to anything.  This is why deadlines are good for me, i have no time to fart around with logistics, i am forced into action because of a time limitation that lights a fire under my butt.  I wonder, is there a procrastinator that puts things off because they keep thinking of important life affirming things happening in their life, that they hope may happen, or come up last minute and whisk them away on an adventure of personal growth and satisfying human exchange and interaction?  Are all artists procrastinators because they are often thinking of the art they would like to make or are making art instead of doing life detail crap?  Or the procrastinator that feels they are going a mile a minute and if they don't slow down and smell the posies they might feel as though they may spontaneously combust?"

Your loving nature makes you wonderful to be<br>around. You are the type of person that accepts<br>people for who they are and they in return of<br>your good heartedness, accept you right back.<br>You are most likely a romantic at heart. With a<br>sensitive soul and probably a broken heart from<br>the past, you don't usually trust people. You<br>have probably been hurt by someone you love or<br>loved dearly which makes it hard to confide in<br>others. Easy going and romantic, fun and<br>lovable, you have a great personality. You are<br>very well liked in the general world that<br>you're in.

in Sadness. Lonely, depressed and feeling broken.<br>For whatever reason, you see
this world only for the bad that it holds carrying<br>the burdens of yourself and
others. Some people like to be with you and your<br>unique vantage point when they
are down, you are someone who can sympathize with<br>them. But you find yourself
alone again when they seem to find a solution and<br>are happy again, yet you still
are stuck in this rut. Do not worry, you will make<br>it out at some time. Everyone
does, if you try. When you are seen all others want<br>to do is make your pain go
away, but that is something only you can do. You<br>probably keep to yourself a lot
and don't like to let people in, afraid to be hurt<br>again. You feel empty and
helpless and your looks reflect that, often seen<br>with tears in your eyes.</font></p>

"event","Most of you who know me well know that my dad had lung cancer (no he doesn't smoke it was from agent orange from the vietnam war). i can remember him coming home from chemotherapy and radiation and just being so sick. his acid reflex was so bad that at my nana's funeral, his mom, he had a bottle of milanta in a brown bag because it was so bad. The last thing that i ever want is to have to see someone that i love dearly go through what my dad had to. 
I'm so terrified because Mike may have cancer... i love him with all of my heart, he has no idea, and i would hate to have to see him go through what my dad had too. Every night now i pray that he doesn't have cancer, and that the bumps are only related to stress. If he does, I'm gunna stay by his side and try to make him as happy & comfortable as possible. 
Baby if your reading this I want you to know that I love you with all of my heart and I'm never gunna leave your side, no matter what happens. I'm sorry if i've been a bitch lately, i'm just so stressed out about school, and i'm worried about you. I don't want anything to ever happen to you. I love you bobo and i always will."

"event","well it turns out that mike did ask one of lauren's friends to im me and pretend to be pat...i wanted 2 cry....he hurt me in the worst way possible, he new that i had loved pat, and that i still had some feelings for him, and he used it against me...even worse, when i called him on it, he lied to me. he said that he lied because he cared about me a didn't want to see me hurt. well mike, ur plan sucked, cuz now im hurt even more. if you had just been up front at first, and admited that you did have me set up, the situation wouldn't have gotten to the place where it is now. i cared about you and trusted you. i trusted you so much that i told you all about pat, thinking that you would respect the fact that ive been hurt really bad before. but no. instead you used it against me. you have completely betrayed me in the worst way possible. i cant believe i trusted you to such an extent. i deffinately regret that now. i'm sorry if your heart's broken, no wait, what am i saying. IM GLAD YOUR HEART'S BROKEN. i may sound like a bitch and i dont care if i do. you diserve to feel that pain. you diserve to feel like crap because you the information i thought i could trust you with against me. i should have known that this would happen. i'm sorry i ever met you. i'm sorry i ever had anything to do with you. i should have known that you would cause problems when ur the reason lauren n me got into a fight. I'm sorry Lauren for not listening to you. I should have Never let a stupid boy come between us. i should have known that if he treated his past girlfriends like crap, then how was i any different? I'm not, i'm just sum girl he used. just sumgirl who now is broken hearted all over again. not only for loosing one guy i really cared about, but because the memories of me & pat have come flooding back. it makes me miss him 100000000 times more...*don't worry sis, i wont try to go back to him*. Mike you will never feel as much pain as i feel right now. you basically have beatin my heart with a bat, had a mac truck drive over it, then shread it to peaces. My heart's begging me to forgive you, but i know better. If you've betrayed me once, what's gunna keep you from doing it again? nothing. I'm sorry for ever thinking that you could possible care about me. For thinking that you would be different from all of the other guys ive dated. because your not. ur just the same. there is one difference tho. you have hurt me more than any of my past boyfriends have. you screwed me over, and i can never forgive you for doing that.

"event","yea so yesterday sum1 imed me sayin they were pat...i new it wasn't really him because they weren't talkin like pat normally talked, so i figured it was mike playin head games with me and went along with it, the hole 9 yards...i said that i only loved pat, and that i could never love someone as muched as i loved him... within the first 30 seconds of talkin 2 ""Pat"" i started thinking that it was mike playin a fucked up joke on me...so deviously me decided 2 play right back sayin how i love him more than mike n shit... then last night mike called me and sounded all hurt n shit and said that it wasn't him that i had the convo with. then he started reading it to me..i asked him where he got it from and he said that one of Lauren's friends sent it 2 him...when the hole convo started, i had called lauren and asked her if mike had another sn and if she thought it was him, she said no...the weird thing is that i never sent the convo to lauren or to her friend.... like 2 days before all this, mike had asked lauren 2 call me on 3 way and not tell me that he was on the fone....so now im thinking that mike asked lauren 2 im me pretending to be pat and send him the convo so he could see what i said. when i asked mike if he was ever gunna tell me about askin Lauren 2 call me on 3 way, he said that he wasn't going to if i didnt ask, so what else is he not telling me about?? y should i have 2 ask him if he set me up? w/e this is getting so fucked up...part of me still wants to go back out with mike, but another part of me wants 2 b single for the summer...im so confused idk what i should do....o well ill figure it out one way or another...

"event","Yea i haven't written in a wicked long time, and a lot of fucked up shit has happened.....the main one being that mi aunt ronnie is in the hospital with cancer.
every family,*i hope* has atleast one family member that doesn't have all their marbles with them, if u no wut i mean. don't get me wrong, i love mi aunt ronnie with all of mi heart, but she, as we all do, have our moments.  given the fact that she only lives up the street from me, she's become one of the few aunts that no me pretty well. she has a pool and as far back as i can remember, she's let me and mi brother swim in it when ever we wanted 2 during the summer. up until a couple of years ago, i always thought that she was in the hospital because she got sick real easily, but then i found out that she had cancer. now it's concidered rare for a person with cancer to over-come it once. well mi aunt's done it about eight tiems now. and no i am  not exagerating. it's come to the point that some of her hair won't grow back, like her eyebrows *she nows has tattoo eye brows, and no it is not cool*. 
when mi mom told me a couple of days ago that she had cancer again, i just dismissed it as if it was a common cold. the next day it really hit home when i found out that she not only had cancer, but double Pneumonia. it's bad enough to have pneumonia in one lung when ur healthy, but it a serious crisis when  u have it in both ur lungs, and while ur going through intensive chemotherapy and radiation. 
so mi mom and aunt barbara went 2 Florida to talk 2 mi aunt and c if there's any chance of getting her back up to boston so mi uncle tom, who's a doctor, can help her with her medical needs. i hate to admit this, but i'm really worred about her. i guess it's cuz when i was younger i was more nieve about cancer until mi dad had lung cancer, and until reciently, i didnt really know just how lucked it was for him to have gotten rid of it and 2 be cancer free for 5 years now. 
well its gettin late and i still have 2 more sections in a practice sat test that im supposed 2 have done for 2morrow, and i have 2 get up at 430 to visit colleges that are 3 hrs away.... good night 2 all, and please keep mi aunt in ur prayers......

"event","Yea so today we went 2 Regis College for a retreate with all the juniors. it was fun...till i started thinking about it...we were supposed 2 write stuff down that people said were good qualities about us. and all i could think about were all the things it said. all the things it said and didnt mean. b4 i new it tears were rollin down mi cheaks and i couldnt stop them from coming. i was tryin 2 b quiet so no1 would notice, but mi friends did. katherine, lauren, and beth all looked up when they heard me *sniffin*. they asked me what was up and i told them with one word: *pat* i didnt have to say all the times he told me he loved me, all the times he looked in2 mi eyes n said he loved me, all the times he told me hed b there and never was. they new what was wrong by lookin at me, cin the look i had on mi face, the tears in mi eyes, and knew. that's what i love about mi friends. we can tell what eachother's feelin/thinkin without havin to say one word.  sometimes i feel like they're inside mi head thinkin with me. tellin me not to call it, not 2 im it, or drive bi it's house, no matter how badly i want 2. they know me better than i no me. it's like  i have another extention of me but in 3 people. they keep me in line even when im completely discombobulated. i love them for that

"event","Well i guess you could call 2day day one. today is the first day off of mi drug, pat. i was addicted to him. no not in the way taht a druggie is addicted to crack cuz it makes them feel better. i was addicted to pats meanness. i was addicted to him breaking my heart. i was addicted to him never being there for me and always saying he was. but most of all, i was addicted to him. i dunno what ever made me think that he would change. change from the way he always broke mi heart. i guess i just turned a blind eye to all the times he made me cry. all the times that he said we would do sumthing and he'd never show up. but i was completely oblivious to all the times he told me that he loved me, but deep inside i knew he never did or would. when i woke up this morning i wanted to cry. not out of sadness, but of happieness. i no longer had to have my heart broken over some guy that i loved that didnt love me back. i have made a promise to my self that i will never get into a situation where i make mi self vulnerable. Pat was in the past, and there he sall stay. i am determined to move a head and never to look back on him. Before pat, i new that someday i would look back on my tears an laugh. but now i no more. now i no that sum guys can make you look back on your laughs and cry. Eamon says it best: fuck what i said it dont mean shit now. fuck all those presents might as well throw them out. fuck all those kisses they didnt mean jack, fuck you you hoe i dont want you back.

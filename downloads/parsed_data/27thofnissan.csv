BRF has all of his writing classes read this one, and I think it's great for anyone who deals with language.  I definetly recomend.

Anyway, the basic idea of this essay is that all language is a lie and can never really express what we want it to.  Like, a word is supposed to express a universal idea, but if that idea were ACTUALLY universal it would be the same for all people and the same in every language.  More than that, words never describe the true range of things.  Like, we only have one word for ""leaf"" but there are so many different kinds of leaves that every person probably thinks of something entirely different when they picture the image of ""leaf"".  So all language is, therefore, lying to some extent.

But, humans only care about being lied to when that lie directly affects their well being.  No one cares about lies if they're not going to be affected by them, so no one really cares about lies withing language.  I especially like this theory in connection with Nazi use of language.  

Think about the phrase ""final solution"".  If you consider the existence of the Jewish people a ""problem"", which the Nazi do, then this ""problem"" would need to be ""solved"".  Killing them all is not only a ""solution"" to the ""problem"", but since there will be no continued existance of the problem it's definetly ""final"".  Therefore, the term ""final solution"" is completely accurate, whether or not you agree with it.   On a linguistic level you can't really argue with it, any argument has to be made on a morality level.

This essay kind of chaged my thinking entirely.  It's not about ""good"" and ""bad"" and ""right"" and ""wrong"", it's about history.  Who am I to judge?  And I think putting yourself in the position of judge is a really bad way to approach history, anyway."

"event","<lj-cut text= ""Shoah, a film by Claude Lanzmann"">

The first thing you'll notice about this film is its stunning simplicity and beauty.   It has more beautiful long shots of nature than Brokeback Mountain, with none of the sheep.  If nothing else, watch it for the cinematography.

The second thing you'll notice is that holy crap are you in for a soul sucking depressing suicide inducing nine and a half hours of fun.

So the Chelmno concentration camp yeilded only two survivors.  Two.  Survivors.  The film opens with one of those survivors singing a folk song in a canoe on a beautiful river.  The amazing thing about this film is two-fold

1.  Lanzmann managed to get so many survivors to sit for interviews.  Not only that, but WHICH survivors he found.  The last person in the film is a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.  That's huge.  The first man in the film got shot in the head, the bullet just barely missing his vital brain centers, hides out in a pig stye, and is rescued by the townspeople and cared for by Russian medics.  Amazing.  The best thing is that you can watch the people give testimony.  The moment that really speaks for the film, i think, comes when an SS officer is giving his testimony.  The only time you see any genuine emotion from him at all is when he's singing the Treblinka pride song all new prisoners were forced to learn upon entry to the camp.  Imagine making people who knew they were going to die sing a song plediging allegiance to not only the place that will kill them, but also to Hitler!  And it's the only time you see ANY emotion from this guy!  His eyes are sparkleing!  Disgusting!

2. Lanzmann doesn't use ANY historical re-enactment, but more than that, he doesn't use ANY footage from the time period or photos.  In the hardest segment to watch, for me anyway, a survivor haltingly describes the process of burning bodies in Aushwtiz while the camera guides the viewer through the ruins.  I cried and had to turn it off, and it takes a lot for me to get emotion about this stuff.

There really isn't anything more powerful than watching survivors give testimony.  Watch it.  It's worth it."

"event","<lj-cut text= ""On the Use and Disadvantages of History for Life"">

Let me first say that this essay was recomended by BRF, who is one of the biggest intellectual jackasses I've ever met.  He's getting a PhD in poetry, and doing his final project on Apocalyptic Literature.  He's also writing a book which will ""rival the Left Behind series and The DaVinci Code, in which the rapture happened in the year 300 AD.""  I think all of this information is necessary for you to really appreciate the circumstances in which this essay came to me.  I'd also like to point out that I read his personal copy of it, complete with underlines and marginal notes, some of which i'm going to share.

Basically, I think this essay is making the case that to be an important historical figure and do something which will have a real lasting impact on history you have to act in ignorance of history.  For instance, if you know that both Napoleon and Hitler attacked Russia and failed miserably, you would never lead your army into battle there, but if you want to be great you have to try, anyway.  This problem leads to there being two kinds of people in society, essentially.

1.  People who study history, who are jaded and miserable and depressed constantly, and who will never be able to be great BECAUSE they are so jaded and miserable. And,

2. People who have casual knowlege of history in a sort of abstract way who do great things and change the world.  Or, people who don't act in fear of the consequences of failure.

So, essentailly, it's up to the first group of people to, quote from the text, ""remint the universally known into something never heard of before, and to express the universal so simply and profoundly that the simplicity is lost in the profundity and the profundity in the simplicity.""  

I think this is a wonderful goal for any historian, and the best example of this I can think of in this field is The Diary of Anne Frank.  It's profound because it is so simple, and it's written simply enough that anyone who has ever been a youth can relate to it, but it still beautifully conveys living under nazi occupation.  I don't know that I've found a camp memoir that does this yet, except maybe This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentleman by Borowski (don't read unless you want to kill yourself.  He survived the camp system only to kill himself- with gas!- in '51.  Not an uplifting read, but worth it.)

And, as promised, some of my favorite BRF's underlines and comments moments.

Quote: ""What does he have but, agian, his profound insight: propogating it and sowing it with full hands he hopes to implant a need: and out of a vigorous deed there will one day arise a vigorous deed""
Margin note: ""me...""  
Oh, if only i could have profound insight, too, BRF...

Quote: ""For all that exists is worthy of perishing.  So it would be better if nothing existed.""
This one is starred.  Uplifting.

Quote: ""Where there had been a stronger and more subtle awareness, another emotion has no doubt also appeared: disgust.  The young man has become so homeless and doubts all concepts and all customs""
Margin note: 'Me!""
This seemed kind of like literary masturbation for emo kids."

"event","<p>I'm working with a poetry PhD candidate on... sort of philisophical perspectives on the Holocaust?&nbsp; Mostly I just really dig the guy and enjoy reading things with him.&nbsp; We're meeting monday to discuss:<br /><br />On the Use and Disadvantages of History for Life, by Nietzsche<br /><br />Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense, also Nietzsche<br /><br />Shoah, a 9 1/2 hour documentary by Claude Lanzmann&nbsp;<br /><br />The Inferno, Dante<br /><br />In general, everything is a written work unless I state otherwise.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll have time to update about those works before we dicuss them, and then edit the entry to post if/how my feelings/perspectives on them have changed after the meeting.&nbsp; The meeting is probably taking place in a bar, and you never know what you're going to get with the ole' Mr. Fest.<br /><br />The title of this blog comes from the Jewish day of remembrance for the Holocaust, which is on the 27th of the month Nissan every year.&nbsp; This date was chosen to comemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and I think it's awesome that something hopeful that demonstrates Jewish resistance and coming together as a community was chosen instead of a less optomistic date.&nbsp; One of my favorite survivor quotes ever is ""In life we can either smile or cry.&nbsp; If you're alive it is better to smile"", and I think that's a great attitude to have in this field.&nbsp; Yes, the work is miserable and hard and soul crushing sometimes, but it's absolutely necessary and doesn't have to be thought of just in terms of how awful things were.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For the record, I'm amazed the three people currently on my friends list ACTUALLY want to read about my boring academic work!&nbsp; Cookies to you!<br /></p>"

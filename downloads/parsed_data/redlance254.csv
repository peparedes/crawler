"event","So let's see update on my life

1. move into a new place

Which was living with roomates that turn out to be a bunch of pots heads that kept on eating my food when i bought it and didn't respect me one bit. So i move out of that place and found a nice small one bedroom place and now paying 300. a month all bills pay and i get cable go me.. lol
2. Found a great job
I now work at McLanes which is a grocery disturbiton center i am a single sell selector i select stuff for gas stations and cvs and wallgreens it easy job and i gotten a raise since i started and  now i making 10.00 and hour and soon will be making 10.50 an hour after my one year which is October 17 
3. Still with a great guy
Well we have had our ups and downs and i have learn alot about what i takes to be in a relationship and it's hard but you can make things work out if you just let go and stop thinking that everything is going to be judge on. 
4.Bought an 30 gig Ipod yesterday for 100.00 from a pawn shop man this things is nice i love it.. 

Things i need to do 

5. Make up with erin.. I know that in my last post that i but i would do this but i keep putting it off and putting off because all the thing that i fear is that it is truly over that all those years of friendship are over and a small part of me is still holding out for a chance that the gods would smile on me and give me back my friends... Elizabeth and i have been talking and she realize that what she did to us was not right and she says she sorry for throwing away her really good friends.. I have forgiven her and i just wish it was like it use to be when we were younger.. things look so much simple back then it was nice didn't have a care in the world we thought we would be friends forever then i open my big mouth.. and was mean and hurtful to someone that i really care about  and i keep on kicking my self going why did you do that why? I don't know why i just know that what i said was not right and now i am left with this nothing.. because i had to be stupid.. So erin if you read this please forgive me.

6. take care of business

7. find a part time job


over all my life is going okay wish i had more friends to hang out and that things were simple but stuff all ways get complicated.. 

things to look forward to

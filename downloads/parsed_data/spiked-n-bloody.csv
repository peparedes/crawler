I've just been to see Alice in Wonderland in 3D.  Absolutely amazing film!  Go see it.
Not just because Johnny Depp was in 3D either...

Benny n' Joon, The Faculty and I Come With The Rain are all films worthy (for my selfish needs anyway) of the 3D experience.  I die...

Anyway, went to Dublin the other weekend for the Irish Film and Television Awards.
Got to say ""hi"" to Colin Farrell, Jon Voight and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  Also got to see Matt Dillon, Aiden Quinn and Josh Hartnett.  

Yes folks, I got to die at the beauty of Josh Hartnett in the flesh.  Next time, I'll get a photo!

Going to London in a few weeks to watch The Two Towers to live orchestra, but it's more an excuse to meet up with friends.  Then off to St Ives for 2 weeks with the family and camera, then back to the States in Oct to spend a few days in New York with friends then back to Philly to stay with Brian and Tracey.

Bit of a rover this year.

Good stuff!"

Police Complaint - just brilliant!
This is a genuine complaint to Devon & Cornwall Police Force from an angry member of the public
A true email sent to the force, lengthy but brilliantly written.....

--------------
Dear Sir/Madam/Automated telephone answering service,
Having spent the past twenty minutes waiting for someone at Bodmin police station to pick up a telephone, I have decided to abandon the idea - and try e-mailing you instead.

Perhaps you would be so kind as to pass this message on to your colleagues in Bodmin, by means of smoke signal, carrier pigeon or Ouija board.

As I'm writing this e-mail there are eleven failed medical experiments (I think you call them youths) in St Mary's Crescent, which is just off St Mary's Road in Bodmin.

Six of them seem happy enough to play a game which involves kicking a football against an iron gate with the force of a meteorite. This causes an earth shattering CLANG! which rings throughout the entire building.
This game is now in its third week and as I am unsure how the scoring system works, I have no idea if it will end any time soon.

The remaining five failed-abortions are happily rummaging through several bags of rubbish and items of furniture that someone has so thoughtfully dumped beside the wheelie bins. One of them has found a saw and is setting about a discarded chair like a beaver on ecstasy pills.

I fear that it's only a matter of time before they turn their limited attention to the caravan gas bottle that is lying on its side between the two bins.
If they could be relied on to only blow their own arms and legs off then I would happily leave them to it. I would even go so far as to lend them the matches.

Unfortunately they are far more likely to blow up half the street with them and I've just finished decorating the kitchen.

What I suggest is this - after replying to this e-mail with worthless assurances that the matter is being looked into and will be dealt with, why not leave it until the one night of the year (probably bath night) when there are no mutants around then drive up the street in a Panda car before doing a three point turn and disappearing again. This will of course serve no other purpose than to remind us what policemen actually look like.

I trust that when I take a claw hammer to the skull of one of these throwbacks you'll do me the same courtesy of giving me a four month head start before coming to arrest me.

I remain your obedient servant
???????

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr ??????,

I have read your e-mail and understand your frustration at the problems caused by youths playing in the area and the problems you have encountered in trying to contact the police.

As the Community Beat Officer for your street I would like to extend an offer of discussing the matter fully with you.

Should you wish to discuss the matter, please provide contact details (address / telephone number) and when may be suitable.

Regards
PC ???????
Community Beat Officer

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear PC ???????
First of all I would like to thank you for the speedy response to my original e-mail.

16 hours and 38 minutes must be a personal record for Bodmin Police Station, and rest assured that I will forward these details to Norris McWhirter for inclusion in his next Guinness book.

Secondly I was delighted to hear that our street has its own Community Beat Officer.

May I be the first to congratulate you on your covert skills? In the five or so years I have lived in St Mary's Crescent , I have never seen you. Do you hide up a tree or have you gone deep undercover and infiltrated the gang itself? Are you the one with the acne and the moustache on his forehead or the one with a chin like a wash hand basin? It's surely only a matter of time before you are head-hunted by MI5 to look for Osama.

Whilst I realise that there may be far more serious crimes taking place in Bodmin, such as smoking in a public place or being Christian without due care and attention, is it too much to ask for a policeman to explain (using words of no more than two syllables at a time) to these twats that they might want to play their strange football game elsewhere.

The pitch on Fairpark Road , or the one at Priory Park are both within spitting distance as is the bottom of the Par Dock, the latter being the preferred option especially if the tide is in.

Should you wish to discuss these matters further you should feel free to contact me on <???????>. If after 25 minutes I have still failed to answer, I'll buy you a large one in the Cat and Fiddle Pub.

Regards
?????????

P.S If you think that this is sarcasm, think yourself lucky that you don't work for the sewerage department with whom I am also in contact !!!"

So what've I been up to since returning from Philadelphia?
Well... not much to be honest.

I'm still slowly working on the pics, but I've been distracted by other things.
I'm writing for fun.  
I've had a commission to photograph more jewelry so that's kept me busy for a few weeks.
I'm waiting for My T.A.P.S. (Ghost Hunters) T-shirt and jacket to turn up.
Watched a few films
Worked more days to cover my colleague

etc etc.  Kinda busy but I feel bad I've not updated more.

Waiting for a date to go see the lovely Dana and Drew in Portsmouth

And...

I'm going to London to watch LOTR all nighter movie marathon with a friend. 
Sore arse ahead.  I should smuggle in a cushion and Redbull."

I really REALLY wanted a Ghost Hunters T.A.P.S. Tshirt.
And a Battlestar Galactica ""I <3 Toasters"" Tshirt but no-one except Kingdom would have got the joke.  I wasn't spending $50 on tshirts.
I figured I'd get them online at a later date.  Guess who doesn't post to Europe?  NYAAARGH!


Klorz enjoyed the art deco of the Rockerfeller Center.

You can see the Flat Iron in this shot and right in the distance is the tiny speck of the Statue of Liberty.   I got a bzillion photos up here.

Then the hungry trio headed off to Little Italy (which crosses China Town) to Brian's fave restaurant.  The Italian kid who cleared our table was too f'n cute!

It was getting dark as we headed out, guess what I found?

RAHH!
It's shaky cos it was dark and my camera was dermined to pretend it was daytime.


We passed Ground Zero on the way to Wall Street.  I got a peek through the fence.  It's so weird seeing them still pulling up the foundations.  Onwards and onwards and I'm bloody dermined we're going to get where we're going, despite the rising guilt that we've been walking forever.  Finally Tracy spots our goal.  


The charging Bull.

Brian had to do a wrestling move to launch me up there.

I stroked it's testicles on the way past.  It took a lot of convincing to make them believe that it's good luck.  All the financial types do it.  That's why they're shiny.  They eventually had a quick feel for themselves.


This is NOT a way to get good luck!

We had way too much fun at the Bull.  Made me feel better about the walk.


So now it's dark and Times Square's lit up like a Christmas Tree.  Got more photos.  Went in the Bubba Gump store and the Hershey's store and wandered down through Broadway until we found this.
<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v297/Spiked_n_Bloody/America/?action=view&current=100_2114.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v297/Spiked_n_Bloody/America/100_2114.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>


We spent close to 12 hours in New York.
I had far too much fun, took far too many photos, walked far too far and loved every minute of it!

2 Retarded things about Philly (or the States in general)

1)  Double parking.  I never managed to get a photograph of this spectacle but let me tell you...  Retarded.  They park with a 3"" gap, bumper to bumper, and seesaw their way back out.  If the street is wide enough they park in a double row.  ""How does the inside car get out?""  I hear you ask.  

They drive along the sidewalk until they can hit the road.  Shit you not.

They will also park in the CENTER lane. (Note how I spelt that?)  So... given the space, the average large road has 5 rows of cars parked.  NUTTERS!

Oh, and they will slow traffic for a 75 cent toll.  


2)  Before Tax.  Here in the UK, stores buy a product, add the profit, then the tax. They total it up and label the price for the customer.  AFTER TAX!  When the price you see is the price you pay! Where you don't have to guess the final amount while counting out coins.  

Why, oh why can't they do this in America?  They're a civilised country. 21st century and all that...  THE PRICE YOU PAY.  Is it SO goddamn hard? 
Malboro $5.59, 2 packs.  ""That'll be $11.98""   
WHAT?  

And don't expect anyone behind a counter to understand your order if you're not from Philly.  Even if you say it slowly.  Very slowly... and a bit loud..."

<lj-cut text=""America update 1"">
So I changed the alarm on my phone to go off at 06:30 and woke up at 07:10. I'd forgotten to set it once I'd changed it.  Bright spark, me.  Taxi's due at 07:30.  Good job I'd showered before bed.  Lee made me a cuppa and toast while I ran round like a headless chicken.  I was ready when the taxi turned up.  Don't ask me how.

Klorz and I get to the airport.

Check the suitcase, breeze through security, waste a bit of time and head to the gate.

We broke through the clouds quickly.  Cotton wool clouds below us, greyish white blanket above with a strip of blue between.

Fucking awesome huh?

I watched 90% of Marley & Me but stopped it before the end, too close to home.  The in flight meal was a little dreary but they fed us every two hours.  Meal and drink, pretzels and drink, hot roll and drink.  4 hours into the flight I got bored and fidgety until I spotted ice crystals on the inner side of the outer glass.  Groovy!

The clouds broke as we hit Canada.

Mile after mile of stark white ice capped hills.  Hills, towns, coasts, rivers.  
Host of the Seraphim by Dead Can Dance playing as we flew over head.  Total serene beauty moment.

We passed a bank of water where the sea cuts into the land and it clouded right over again.  No more view for a while.  My very first view of the USA was my very first view of Philadelphia right as we dove back beneath the clouds, circling to land.

Hello America!

Border control was fun.  Not.
Took me 40 minutes to get through.  They weren't in a rush...
Funny story actually.

Officer: ""Why you coming to the States?""
Me: ""I'm staying with a friend... vacation.""
Officer: ""A friend from England?""
Me: ""No.  Philly.""
Officer: *looks at me like, how the fuck do you know someone from Philly?*  ""What's your friend do?""
Me: *looks embarrassed* ""Um... he's a wrestler.""
Officer: *looks at me like I'm retarded*  ""A professional wrestler?""
Me: *blushes and grins* ""Yeah...""
Officer: *looks at me like I'm shitting him*  ""What's his name?""
Me: ""Brian Heffron""
Officer: *glances at my 'where are you staying' declaration and types furiously on his screen*  ""Oh...  You here for his birthday?""
Me: *victorious smirk*  ""Yeah.""
Officer: *stamps my passport*  ""Go on!""

HAHA!  I had to fucking name drop just to get into the country!  

So yeah, after all that I get through, finally find Brian and we're here.  Safe and sound.

I love Brian and Tracy.  She laughs at me when I spot normal everyday-to-her things in the store.  I'm like a kid in a fuckin' sweet shop!  

I'm having a blast just being here!

"event","So I booked a hotel and headed off to 1PW on Sat.  Took the little blue cat with me.

<lj-cut text=""4 hours 3 trains and 2 buses later""> I'm at the arena armed with Blue Meanie's ring theme cos the dufus forgot his.  Got in early, thanks to said ring theme \m/ and accosted the bWo at their merch table.  I missed Meanie <b>SO</b> hard.

Hung out, took photos for fans, babysat the merch table, watched a few matches, marked out, hung at the arena forever waiting for a ride, hung out at the hotel with pizza and the boys until a very tired, jetlagged BM had to go bed.  I'd made the mistake of buying redbull at the bar, so 4:30 I'm still staring at the back of my eyelids in my room, freezing my tits off cos I'd forgotten to shut my window earlier.  Woke up every 45 mins and gave up at 8am.

Sunday was a far better day.  I was dead... but free Monster drinks soon erased that.

Watching Nigel Mcguinness stump Martin Stone with countless card tricks was an amusing way to wait for a lift to the arena.  I love watching the Q&A's.  6 wrestlers sat in the ring, opinionated questions from smart marks that get shot down in open honest replies.  I love those wrestler guys. Smarks are marks.  No question.

Did lunch with Meanie and Jerry Lynn before the doors reopened for the main event.  Met up with Chris, babysat the merch table again, watched a blinding night of vastly improved (with good reason) matches.  I marked, I danced, I stood on Meanie's chair, I cheered, I shared a Hot dog with Little Guido.  Shit you not.

I got photos of Klorz with some of the boys.

Thanks to Rick, Meanie, Jerry, Dan, all the boys who made it a blinding weekend and chris, for bringing me home.  I like Ben's g/f.  ""We know what it is, Gobshyte!""

Fun weekend.  Loved every minute.
Until I had to go home and got all upset.  I hate that last hour knowing it's over.  Last time I didn't get to see him again for 3 years.
But I do get to see him again in 3 and 1/2 weeks, and finally hang with Tracy too.  It's gonna be awesome!

"event","Today I woke up full of the joys of ...well not Spring obviously. The world was lay under a blanket of white powder snow, barely touched, with the sun still hiding behind the hill.

The walk to my lift spot was spectacular.  Making footprints in deep virgin snow, the clouds turning pink as the sun blazed up over the hill setting it's snowcloud blanket ablaze with orange and yellow.  It was like the sky was on fire.  Wherever the sun's light poked through the snow glowed with golden sparkles.

I would have paid work not to make me go in today. I was crying for my camera. 

Every break, I went outside, face turned up to the falling snowflakes, beaming like a 6yr old child.  Catching them on my tongue or on my sleeve and studying the tny individual snowflakes with wonder.

It wasn't until 15 mins before I clocked off when I was told all roads into my town were closed that I fell out with it.  No buses, no train, no taxis. Roads are deathtraps. Do not travel. 
Well I'm not sleeping in the office so I'll walk. 4 miles. Uphill. In the snow. With a hole in my boot.

Managed to wangle a lift.  Managed not to have any accidents despite many near miss skids.
I'm home. I'm probably snowed in.  It's still beautiful outside."

"event","Miz posted a link to EQ (Emotional Quotient) after a discussion on IQ (Intelligence Quotient)

http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm

My result was alarmingly accurate. Right down to the little, hidden things.

<lj-cut text=""My result - The Councelor"">

Idealist Portrait of the Counselor (INFJ)

Counselors have an exceptionally strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others, and find great personal fulfillment interacting with people, nurturing their personal development, guiding them to realize their human potential. Although they are happy working at jobs (such as writing) that require solitude and close attention, Counselors do quite well with individuals or groups of people, provided that the personal interactions are not superficial, and that they find some quiet, private time every now and then to recharge their batteries. Counselors are both kind and positive in their handling of others; they are great listeners and seem naturally interested in helping people with their personal problems. Not usually visible leaders, Counselors prefer to work intensely with those close to them, especially on a one-to-one basis, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes.

Counselors are scarce, little more than one percent of the population, and can be hard to get to know, since they tend not to share their innermost thoughts or their powerful emotional reactions except with their loved ones. They are highly private people, with an unusually rich, complicated inner life. Friends or colleagues who have known them for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that Counselors are flighty or scattered; they value their integrity a great deal, but they have mysterious, intricately woven personalities which sometimes puzzle even them.

Counselors tend to work effectively in organizations. They value staff harmony and make every effort to help an organization run smoothly and pleasantly. They understand and use human systems creatively, and are good at consulting and cooperating with others. As employees or employers, Counselors are concerned with people's feelings and are able to act as a barometer of the feelings within the organization.

Blessed with vivid imaginations, Counselors are often seen as the most poetical of all the types, and in fact they use a lot of poetic imagery in their everyday language. Their great talent for language-both written and spoken-is usually directed toward communicating with people in a personalized way. Counselors are highly intuitive and can recognize another's emotions or intentions - good or evil - even before that person is aware of them. Counselors themselves can seldom tell how they came to read others' feelings so keenly. This extreme sensitivity to others could very well be the basis of the Counselor's remarkable ability to experience a whole array of psychic phenomena.

"event","1. I love lists. I make them all the time. For everything. They're scattered all over the house for cleaning & decorating, in diaries for 101 or 52 Things, in notebooks for photoprojects etc. However, I rarely have the motivation to do everything on them so I find them in cupboards 3 years later and realise I STILL haven't cut the privets.

2. I've forgotten 99% of what I learned at university.  But I'm still an astrophysics geek.

3. As a young teenager I was talked into joining the Mormon church by a cute missionary.  Then I actually read the book and left.  What a pile of racist, homophobic horseshit that is.

4. I get a guilt trip every time I eat meat. I won't eat the majority of what's available.

5. I have many phobias. Spiders isn't one of them, but they still freak me out a little. Phobias include Hypodermics, Dentists, hospitals, dependance, incarceration and old age.

6. I'm actually hoping the world ends in 2012.  For purely selfish reasons.  I have to keep telling myself it might NOT. 

7. I miss horses.  I miss horseriding terribly but thanks to my back I probably never will ride again let alone have a horse of my own.  This depresses me immensely.

8. I do not have infinite patience. This came as a shock to me.  I do have almost infinite tolerance though. If only because it's easier to keep my mouth shut most of the time.  I tend to frighten people when the tolerance runs out and tell people how it is.  I can be a smidge on the abrupt side.  If I tell you it's because you NEED to hear it.  Whether you WANT to or not.

9. I am not the type of friend who will tell you what you want to hear.  I'm honest, value my honesty or don't fucking ask me!

10. I will take your secret to my deathbed. 

11. I have serious personal space issues. Get the fuck away from me. I hate it when people try to touch or hug me, but if I'm in a bouncy mood you're probably going to get one anyway.  If I'm completely relaxed around you, space and contact isn't a problem.  This depends more on my state of mind at the time than who you are. 

12. I don't hold grudges and I don't hate. Hate is a self-harming emotion. The person you hate doesn't suffer, just you.  Get over it, let it go, be free of it and move on.

13. I'm an ecclectic Pagan. I believe what 'feels' right. Not what someone tells me to believe. Some days I am the candle. Some days I can't even see the light.

14. I am fiercely monogamous. 

15. I love snow. Big fat, silent flakes of snow I can catch on my tongue. I love making footprints in virgin snow.  The world is so pretty after snowfall.

16. I love to dance in storms too.

17. I have a serial killer demon locked inside my conscience. I'm a good girl, but the urge is overwhelming.  He keeps me safe, he keeps me awake but he makes me laugh too.

18. I can't decide if I'm imbalanced but hide it well and appear sane or if I am sane because I deal with the imbalance.

19. I still believe in fairies.

20. I love sci-fi and good wrestling but can't suspend my disbelief for action flicks.

21. I'm addicted to caffiene, nicotine and probably sugar.  I used to be addicted to Chocolate. That is one BITCH of an addiction to kick.

22. I can't watch or read the news. I winds me up to ranting point. I don't understand how humanity can be so fucking selfish and stupid.  What happened to reason?

23. People tell me I'm articulate. But I don't feel articulate enough. Maybe it's because there's so many levels and aspects of me that I just can't portray them all thoroughly. People still only get a snapshot. You don't gain understanding from a snapshot.  Perhaps you wouldn't understand anyway, not everyone thinks and feels the way I do.

24. I think it's sad that people overlook the many little happinesses they're given because they're looking for one big one.  Life doesn't dole them out often.  Enjoy the little things. Squirrels, snowflakes, ladybirds, sunsets, starry nights, a warm fire on a rainy day, a good joke, finding a penny, hugs, the feel of animal fur, sound of a stream, pavement cafes, bakery smells...  They add up.

25. I can do almost anything I put my mind to, art, craft, science, maths, tai chi, riding, photography, decorating, DIY, etc but I'm a terrible procrastinator. I blame the internet."

This may be funny, but it's often true O_o


<b>NINE WORDS WOMEN USE</b>


(1) Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.


(2) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.


(3) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually end in fine.


(4) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission.
Don't Do It!

(5) Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about nothing. (Refer back to # 3 for the meaning of nothing.)

(6) That's Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.


(7) Thanks: A woman is thanking you, do not question, or faint. Just say you're welcome. (I want to add in a clause here - This is true, unless she says 'Thanks a lot' - that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say 'you're welcome' . that will bring on a 'whatever').


(8) Whatever: Is a woman's way of saying F-- YOU!


(9) Don't worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking 'What's wrong?' For the woman's response refer to # 3."

I love finding things.  Mostly I just photograph them.

Recently my only 'found thing' was the Hello Kitty that Klorz befriended.  They're currently sat on the TV.  
I also get a ton of cable ties and vinyl banners from work for Lee's graff.  They bin them otherwise.  

What else?

I have a hobby horse that THE Paul Simon was throwing away, my gran managed to get it for me.

Lee found a sheep skull but that technically hadn't been thrown away.
Neither had the fiver some time back.

I tend not to make a habit of salvaging from bins, so finds are either 'lost' or 'about to be thrown'

Found things are awesome."

"event","Today I had one of those ""Well that's not something you see every day"" moments.

Having a cig outside work when a shopping trolley wheels past in the carpark with a small toddler in it.  
Travelling sideways.
At running speed.
Except no one was running.

By the time I reacted it disappeared behind a 4X4.  I heard the thunk and started running.
A woman reappeared with the trolley wheeling it back to a very distraught mother.

The trolley hit the back of her car while she was putting shopping away.
Thank fuck it didn't hit a kerb or the toddler was going over at speed.


Was actually kinda comical now that I know the kid was ok."

I wish you the clarity to find happiness in small places.
I wish you the sense to appreciate those small happinesses in a life that can be overwhelming.
I wish you moments of calm when you need them.
I wish you moments of joy when you least expect them.
I wish you peace of mind.

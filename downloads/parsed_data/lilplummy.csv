""just kidding around"" is the name. honestly, i preferred it when i was working at both places. two jobs makes me happy, mostly because the home front will always be stupid. its just i never got to see gerard. and my summer was becoming all working i wasnt even home. but whatever.
i seem to have noticed the people i've known, well they're growing smaller and smaller, just because they scattered across america.. 2 in penn, 1 in arizona, 1 in florida, 1 in south carloina and georgia. what happened to the good old days. and its not like a few left, it was like they all left and now live in different states..we scattered yo. i miss my babies.two more years and i'll be done with school and we can make our history."

but then i just have to just push those memories away from me, and i'll keep destroying everything thats come across to me that reminds me of it..because i am happy now,and he's worth more to me than anything thats happened sophomore year."

a couple of days ago me and laird went on a journey to find a place where he can get his labrette pierced..i had to hold his hand when the needle was puncturing his lip..i cant stand needles,they make me feel uncomfortable; and when im uncomfortable, i make jokes..so the piercer told laird that there was a possibility his bottom lip would swell up..and then so rudely, i exclaimed ""your nigger lips are going to be huge!"" ....ha..and thats my story.

then she came home recently..and you know you promised to see her and you were really planning on to as well...but fucked up shit happened...she never called you after that weekend..
so you know what..this is the last time i'll say it..our group of friends wont be the same, you can keep telling them ur disappointed in me,and im a bad friend but it wont bother me cos we're not in high school anymore..and im sorry for how things are with us now, or what you may be going thru..but im done trying to defend myself because i dont have to see anyone anymore."

"event","its ass early...so early..my father decided to wake me up abruptly because soemone called my room line and he wanted me to check..so here i am, its 8:30 in the am on my day off..wonderful.
gerard slept over last night..he's still sleeping. its fun when he sleeps over cos i dont have to say goodbye to him until the next day =) suprisingly, my parents were okay with boys sleeping over at one point during high school. but then thigns changed and then no boys were allowed but now they seem to not mind when gerard does. oh the perks.
anyways, i skipped class friday cos i was sick..not really but i jsut didnt feel like spending 6 hours in drawing class cos i was ready to crack..sheriously i have not missed ONE day of school in the month of september..that's a BIG accomplishment..but also school's weirdly hard and i needed a few hours to myself.

I'm going back to bed. im still tired. and i hate you..no, i kid.

i dont know what day it was but me n robbie were playing with kneadable eraser..you kno, the cool thing that looks like clay BUT it erases pencil work? its amazingingly decieving. so anyways i got mad at him and i smushed it with his arm hair and i wasnt really expecting a retaliation cos all he did was look at me for like 2 minutes Buuuuuuuuut then out of nowhere he smashes a huge clump of kneadable eraser in my hair..yea...he retaliated like 2 minuets late..so im standing there dumbfounded and finally i scream cos its like stuck in my hair..this girl jen had to take it out little by little cos it was so entangled in my hair..raving lunatic.
later me robbie n lisa were getting soemthing to eat and then robbie picked me up and body slams me down on the concrete floor..all i kno was that it hurt but i laughed alot and squirmed around on the ground as if i was a dog..hahaha

"event","""Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colours on the snowy linen land
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds and violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colours changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand""

oh yea tuesday was also godfrey's birthday but we took him out to eat on monday cos tuesday was boyfriend day =)..godfrey also accompanied me to buy my school supplies which now leaves me with no money this week. oh i love art school.
this week was pretty good..i had sculpture class on thursday and me n my friend were talking about how i used to eat the clay in high school, and all the otehr weird thigns i did.. i also had lunch wiht my cousin on wednesday which was totally weird, not even going to discuss what we conversed about..forreals weird..
friday i drove to the shore!! amazeeeeeeeed..right? cos i suck at driving and all that fun stuff.gerard said i did good..then i told laird about my trip and that g said i did okay driving..but laird said ""of course he has to lie to u cos ur his girlfriend""..butttttt..laird's also afraid of downtown passaic even during daytime..so we cant always take his word on things.. hahaha..

"event","today is my first day off from everything since like i dont even kno..probably last sunday..but oh the perks in life that make the world go round and around :-)
so the first week of school is over..can i just say i dont even kno how i got into an art school,these kids in my classes they're unbelieveably talented, making me over here look like an amateur drawing stickpeople and sculpting melting monsters..its really amazing how they're at ease and still do so well. im over jealous, but its a great experience to be surrounded by great talent..and it gives me motive to work extra hard, more than i ever ((which isnt saying much, considering i do mostly half-ass jobs on everything)) but it really makes me want to start getting serious and stop fucking around..almost that is..i will though..so i met all my teachers, they're all kooky in a way, but its every enjoyable and it feels like i'll learn more now than i ever did in any class i ever took..invigorating.
laird came home this weekend..we watched garden state and it was a good movie..but i must say my friends are emotional little bastards..but its fun and i had fun, even though every time we hang out they go out to eat before they get me,so i NEVER end up eating and im always hungry..you bitch..and then it was weird cos we go to this kid's hosue that's friend's with godfrey and laird and there's two kids there that i went to elementary school with..but they were like 3 years younger than i..hmm..we left immediately...it made me laugh though cos when we got there laird sees the little bikes and motorbike things in the driveway and he's like ""yeah we're not staying long"" and i didnt get it until i realized that he meant those kids were hella younger than we..oh it was a funny night.
and so today..its a scavanger hunt.and i hope i find everything i need =)"

"event","i had a really good weekend. The prior plans were killed,but  gerard ended up spending the weekend at my house so it turned out to be won-der-ful.
i started classes today, a bit intimidating because im surrounded by people who are 95% of the chance way better than i and probably more creative.but then emotions' are what drive people to create the way they do so 95% of the people must have led a more fucked up life compared to me. kudos. so this is what my mornings are like on a school day. wake up at like 615, shower, dress, get dropped off at hte station at like 715..train to hoboken, then path to either 23rd st or 14th depending on my schedule. im still not believing this is my school, that im actually in an art school, and that i actually made it to college..its just a big shock.
so the people in my class today seemed real nice. i met a few, i knew one of the kids from orientation, and that was a relief cos i know no one. then i had lunch with robbie,alex and this girl lisa. it was fun; they were chill kids, considering that every time i tell someone i go to an art school most of hte time people would be like ""oh u're going to be surrounded by weirdos""...yea that sterotype was pretty much killed,mostly cos i didnt believe those people but also cos i found them to be real nice.yea shallow bitches.
I'm really lucky for everything i have right now, im so happy i could burst.."

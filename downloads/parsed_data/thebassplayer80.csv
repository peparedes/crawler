"event","Greetings,

Just thinkin about the road ahead.  What is in store?  The path is in front of me.  When things are finally clear, the merkiness really comes out.  Sometimes I feel like I've landed at a place where I'm set up to waitout the rest of my life... there isn't much place else to go from here on out.  Life is a series of graduations.  You graduate High School, then College, then you work for 30 some years and then you Graduate life in retirement.  Then you just wait to die basically.  I feel like I need to make something bigger out of things, but I don't know how or when I can make these changes.  Constant races against the clock, never a time to take yourself away from the parade.  So now is the time to make it happen.  Do what you need to do in order to be happy cause the next thing you know, you'll be too frail to get to the places you wanted to be.  Make the most out of every moment.  It is such a hard thing to do.  You absolutely cannot appreciate the present until it is past.  For instance, I worked on a job in Rochelle, IL with a very good crew.  I was talking to the engineer, Larry Groech, who is 67 years old and has been working for the railroad for about 50 years.  Anyway, while we were talking, I couldn't help but think that this may be one of the last times I get to spend with this guy because he could retire at any time.  One of the branch lines we worked on is being sold to another railroad so it is effectively a relic of the past.  It made me realize just how much things change and why its worth to spend a couple extra minutes taking in a sight, or spending in conversation, or whatever you need to do to make the moment a truely memerable one.  There is so much I wish I could do and should do it sometimes drives me nuts.  For tonight I wish you all are happy and that you take a moment a look around and see what is really around you and make sure you treat it as you would if it was going to be gone tomorrow because nothing lasts forever."

"event","So,

I've been workin out in Rochelle, IL for the last couple days.  It's been pretty fun actually.  Except for the trainmaster there. Lets just say I had a little ""run in"" with him a couple weeks ago.  Oh well.  Its fun gettin paid to ride around and climb on trains all day.  

Other than that... not much is going on.  Same old every day.  Hopin I get a chance to meet some new people soon and see some people I haven't seen in a long time (you know who you are).  I do miss everyone.  It was a lot of fun.  Don't get much chance to half the things I used to do.  

Things are always moving foward.. often times too fast and at other times, too slow.  Things are doing both for me these days.  A part of me enjoys it and another hates it.  So needless to say some times I'm happy and sometimes I'm sad.  Guess everyone goes through that.  

Well thats all I gots to say for now.  

C ya'll later.

P.S. The picture is of the railroad I work for.. for those of you who don't know."

"event","Again, its been a long time since I wrote in this journal.  What can I say.. I'm bad at articulating my feelings.  But my feelings do come out every so often which is why I chose to write in here tonight.  Lately I have been overwelmed with feelings of excitement, dispair, anxiety, love, hate, jealousy, just to name a few.  

The exitement, anxiety, some love, and hate all stem from my new choice in paths; the railroad.  For those of you who know me, I am very much a rail nut and getting a job working for the railroad would seem like a dream come true.  Not so much the case as with anything one loves, as soon as you start having to do it, it looses almost all appeal.  Plus the hours, and working conditions are horrendous.  Which means it doesn't leave much time to do much else.  

That is where the dispair comes in.  Because I don't have time to do much else, I can't do the other things I think is important in life.  Music has almost completely dissappeared from my life and its starting to take its toll.  All I want is a regular enough schedule where I can purse music once again.

Jealousy.. its quite a word and one that is not to be used lightly.  I'm not necissarily a jealous person, but there are certain things in life that other people have that I long for.  It doesn't have much to do with material items or money.  It is more of the personal and emotional situations.  My best friend is one of those who is never without a girlfriend.  And for that I am jealous.  There has always been this hole in me that has only been filled breifly in my 23 years on this earth.  One thing I've always wanted and at times the only thing I've ever really truly wanted and asked for is to have someone special to be there with me.. no matter where I go, what I do, or Who I am.  For some reason it never really happens for me.  Occasionally there will be someone, but it doesn't last for one reason or another.  Perhaps I am picky, or just unlucky, but either way I get very jealous when I'm around people who are a couple.  I always wonder when it will be my turn to have that person I really love and that really loves me.  But who knows... it'll happen when I least expect it.  But it doesn't help the hole I have now and will continue to have until that day everything falls into place.

For now I wait and see what life throws at me next.  there is so much I want to do and expereince but my chances for exploration are running thin.  Hopefully things will become better as time goes on.

Remember.. ""every passing moment is a chance to turn it all around..""

Time can only tell whats next."

"event","Its been a while since I wrote in this last... its funny becuase I was writing a song that had to do with the poem I wrote in my last entry over 8 months ago... some things never change.  I'm back in Chicago now still looking for gainful employment and a spot in this world of ours.  Things are pretty good.  My time is always occupied and I'm enjoying myself.  Still missin the usual though... that long sought after, coveted, elusive life companion.  Some people want millions and others want fame.  I just want someone that I love and that feels the same way.  Seems simple enough... oh well.  I need a little time to get things together first.  Other than that I have no insightful stuff to say otherwise I'd say it.  Just gotta keep on keepin on I guess.  

Until next time... Peace out."

"event","The Long Misty Road

I travel weightlessly along this long misty road.
I cannot see where it leads.
I know not where it goes, just faithful that it will not end.
It can only take me to more roads, more places.
For the future is encountered along this,
a long misty road.

The poem is a work in progress but it is trying to evolk the feelings of moving into the future.  Right now it is unknown whats going to happen with me and my life and that is how I feel.  Like I'm driving into the mist on some obscure farm road.  I don't know where its going just know that it will take me somewhere.  So I am a little aprehensive yet excited to see what happens.

Other than that, I'll be goin to Florida in a couple days.  I hope its a good trip.  I'm looking foward to seeing my grandparents.  Its been a while since I've seen them last.  Florida is so great.  

I have a new, well, replacement digital Camera that I received as a graduation present.  I'm very excited.  I will start posting some pictures soon.  Give a better insight into what goes one with me.  

Well I hope all is well and that you all are looking foward to the Holidays and the New Years.  2003 baby.  Dang never thought I'd see it.  Take care everyone and remember...

Have Fun!"

"event","I suppose there is always a time for firsts.    I got my first speeding ticket last night (early this morning) from a Cass County Sheriff.  They were patroling a section of Route 125 coming out of Beardstown approaching Virginia, Illinois.  Don't ask why I was there because I don't know.  I've been driving safely and ticket free for about 6 years so I guess it was bound to happen sometime.  Might as well be now than later on down the road... so to speak...  

Graduation is fast approaching.  I hope I pass all my classes.  It will be interesting.  I still have no clue what to do after I get out.  Guess only time will tell.  

Other than that, there is nothing new going on and I'm just waiting for a big change.  Until next time, have fun!"

"event","I am approaching my last days of school.  I am totally elated about it since I can't stand frickin school.  I've hated school since Preschool but truged through it and now that I'm done, I feel almost lost.  Its all I've done since I was 4 and I'm curious whats gonna happen afterwords.  Thursday (Today) is my last official day of class and its almost driving me crazy.  So close yet so far.  We'll see what happens. 

Hopefully music will take off soon.  Get the ball rolling on recording and touring.  It will be a long and interesting road.  

Until next time, have fun everyone!"

"event","Ever feel like you are an old soul.  Sometimes I wonder if I am really 22 or not.  I feel more like I'm about 35 or 40.  Somethings I shouldn't really know about or know how they feel yet I do.  Then again I wonder if I just think too much about things.  :) Thus starts the vicious circle of late night thought which is my life.  Contemplating life and things that I experience or do.  

** smack! **

Ok enough philisophical stuff.  Anyway, today has been good.  Didn't really do much but did help around the house some.  Gotta go christmas shopping soon.  I have no clue what to get anyone but I'll see what I can do.  

Hope you all have a good day tomorrow!  Have fun!"

"event","Alls I gots to say is MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Food is awesome.  Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and lots... and I mean LOTS!.. of gravy.  Great stuff.

Got to visit with my family today.  My cousins' kids are so cute plus they both have more on the way.  Pretty exciting stuff. 

Today has been good.  I hope tomorrow is good too.  There is too much I want to do and too little time to do it.  I'd like to head downtown and capture some good crowd photographs.  There is nothing cooler than walking through a large group of people and taking 1/2 second to 1 second exposures.  The amazing ghost images are very intruiging.  If I go, I'll post my photographs.  Wish me luck!

Until next time... have fun!!"

"event","Greetings everyone!  Today has been a good day.  I came home today from Normal back to Arlington Heights.  Its nice to be home.  I'm going to miss my friends and stuff down at school but its not for too long plus I get time to catch up with my family and friends I have up here. 

Heading down to the ""South Side"" today for Thanksgiving dinner.  I'm looking forward to it.  Lots of food plus my cousins and aunts and uncles are pretty cool.  Its always nice to sit and chat with family.  There are so many new kids running around now cause all my cousins are having kids of their own.  ahh how times change.  Makes me excited to start my own family.

Today is also happy because I've had good talks with my friends.  Actually its been the last couple days where I have had a lot of good discussion.  

I've decided that I am going to pursue a career in music somehow.  I'm praying everyday for it.  There have been a few opportunities sprouting up here and there for potential bands and it is very exciting.  I guess only time will tell what happens.  

I hope that everyone feels content this week since it is a time of thanks giving.  Being thankful not only for what God provides us for our survival but also what he provides us in talent and in friends.  So tonight I end on a good note for once and hope everyone takes care."

"event","So this is my first entry on this journal.  I'm a little curious about what to write about since I usually never write things down.  Today has been a good day for the most part.  Did a lot of talking about future plans today.  

Any of you ever just feel depressed and sad even when everything is all good?  The uncertainty of the direction of my life is really wearing me down and I don't really know what to do.  I am not too worried because I know God will provide everything that I need but sometimes I wish he would fill me in on what he wants me to do.  

Also, sorry for whining so much, do you ever feel an unexplainable emptiness in your heart or soul?  Again I can't explain because outwordly there is nothing ""wrong"" with anything.  However I do not have the one thing that I long for so much which is a family of my own, or rather the potential of the woman to start up a family with.  I see so many people with significant others and getting married that somtimes I can't help but get jealous of the companionship and unconditional love they experience.  All the money in the world could not replace those kinds of relationships.  

On a lighter note.  I am very happy that I have friends that love me and that care for me.  I don't know what I would do without them.  Pickle, thanks for everything you do.  Thanks to Amanda and Mandy for putting forth the effort for getting the ball rolling on the music and just your enthusiasm and love for what you do and for God.  Thanks to everyone else for the support and friendship they bring to my life.  I appreciate each and everyone of you.  Thank you too for reading my journal.  Again this is the first one so I hope I didn't bore you too much with what was on my mind.  

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!"

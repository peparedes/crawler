"event","I Don't Wanna GOOOOOOOO! But I have to, already said I would and I'm really excited about seeing the nephew and niece. I am not looking forward to the 22 hour drive that will be made mostly by mom and me (twice in a week and a half) I am looking forward to the zoo and Busch gardens though. I think it's been about 5 years since I've ridden a roller coaster and I hope they are only slightly busy so we don't have to wait in line for 109873765453 hours. And who doesnt love the zoo, Cathy said it's a crappy one so it shouldnt take longer than 3 hours to see the whole thing, but since the tickets for Busch gardens were so much, it's been concluded that we are staying from 10-10 and I hope I don't get sun burnt or have my legs fall off in the process. 

            I'm gonna miss Jake something fierce and he shall miss me too. He gets so sad and then I get even more sad, it's an endless downward spiral of sadness hahaha, not funny! I think the time will go by super fast for me. I'll be so busy playing with the babies, watching movies, playing games and 4 days alone are driving in which I should have plenty to read and I started a new novel I'm working on and I have some ideas to put into it thanks to advice from Jake and his friend Kyle. I never get very far when I start writing, the most I had was 15 pages and while the story as a whole might have been okay, I felt it was very mundane and just plain boring from the front. 

          I like to read books that are written a certain way and Kyle pointed out a few things and I realize I was writing in a completely different way than I like to read. Why would I do that? Why would I write a book that I myself wouldnt like certain parts of. I am extremely over critical of everything I write, which is why I usually give up after the first few paragraphs. If I don't give up it turns out sounding forced and awful. Then I hear ""You have to push past that"" and so I have determined myself to actually do it. Not for anyone else but myself, it will probably never leave this house, unless it's brilliant of course, but seeing as I know how I write, I doubt that very much.

            Well I suppose that is all I had to say I guess and now it is back to bed for me. Lately I've been waking up after only 5 or so hours of sleep. I wonder why that is. Oh well, kids, I guess we'll never know.....dun dun dunnnnn. Have fun out there while I'm living it up in Vergina, thats right I said Vergina. Talk to you crazy cats later ^_^"

"event","Do you ever feel like you're slipping? Falling into things you can't control, beyond your power to understand? I don't feel like this often, just recently and I'm hoping it goes away. Tater just came back to the computer room looked at me, so I called him and he rolled over onto his back and I can hear his tail thumping against the carpet. It's things like that that brighten my whole day. Does that sound silly that one little puppy has so much power over my emotions? haha well either way, I've completely forgotten what I was going to write about.  I miss having friends close to me. I miss Deidre and Amber, hanging out, talking about girly things and just generally being silly with girls. I hope Cathy gets Ft. Sill so that way I won't be so alone and I can go over every day and see the kids and not be so alone all day. Also, getting a job should help,a nd that will happen when I get back from Virginia *cross fingers* woo. Okay I'm going back to sleep now, had a crazy dream that woke me up, left me bothered. MINI NAP TIME!!!!! Talk to you crazy cats later <3<3"

"event","<font size=""+1"">I just watched Armageddon and this is not the first time I've seen this movie, it's possibly the 6th or 10th or somewhere in between. I swear I bawled more in that movie than I ever remember doing before. 

           It got me thinking.... Isn't it funny how certain situations in your life can completely change your outlook on the silliest things? For instance, if you have never been in love before and don't know what that connection with another person is, you aren't going to fully understand the emotions being portrayed by the actors.  

          When I first saw Armageddon, I didn't even get close to crying, I think I said, ""Oh, that's so sad!"" and I completely sympathized for the characters. Whereas when I saw it this time, I kept putting myself in the position to lose a loved one. I wonder if I'm the only one who does that, I can't be. I couldn't contain the tears as I thought about the same situation, but if it were real, cause obviously something like Armageddon is a little farfetched, or at least I hope it is. 

           When you are 15 or 16 you don't really really think about the situations in those movies as they would pertain to you, you just think of it as a movie and you are sad/happy/excited/scared for the characters not the actual situation that's happening. I just think it's amazing how people can change, and also that the older you get, the more things and situations you experience, the more your emotions and views on things are going to change, without you even realizing it.</font>"

"event","<font size=""+1""><font color=""#00ffff""> Thousands of fears are swimming through my head right now and I can't pin a one of them down. Not that I couldn't sit down and write a list of everything I'm worried about, it's more like I don't WANT to sit down and right a list. Maybe I'm afraid that once I start writing them down, they are a realization and I'll also realize I can't do anything about them. Like everything in life, it takes time for things to be set right again, also, money. I'm tired of my constant battle with money. I'm tired of having only 1 car and having to find a job that I can work around Jake's schedule. It's hard enough to find a job in this run-down part of Oklahoma, but I need a job with certain hours and certain days. I don't need a certain pay, I'll take 6 bucks an hour if that's all they can pay me, at least it would be enough for groceries every week. 
              I should just quit worrying about things, that's what Jake tells me. Sometimes a girl can't help but wonder where things went wrong in her life. Don't get me wrong, I love my life now. Jake fills me with indescribable feeling and emotions I never knew existed. I have the best dogs in the world, great friends and family, who could ask for anything more. What I mean by the aforementioned comment was this; college, money, kids, a house of our own. Things of that nature that always seem too far away from my extended grasp. 
             I think of myself as an optimist, Jake calls himself a realist.  I think we both fall in between both categories or sometimes choose to view things from the others point. I don't like to be depressed and worrisome over things I can't control right now without the proper variables in place, such as time and money, but that seems to be what I lie awake thinking about at night. Ah well, I guess there's nothing for it and I'll just have to quit holding onto the worry stone so tight. </font></font>"

"event","<font size=""+1"">This is a poem I wrote forever ago that I just recently found on www.poetry.com  I forgot that I had written it and that it was one of the ones that was published in their books. Fun! It's not great, it's sort of mediocre, but I wrote it a very long time ago.

<u>Silent Vow</u>

Ever after eternity, when our bodies fade and die,
Our love will live on, filling earth to sky.
When our world is gone, and there's nowhere left to stand,
You'll still have my heart in the palm of your hand.
Whenever, seems so far away and time will never begin,
I will spend my life with you, right to the very end.
If there is no end, and we continue, alive,
I'll love you, with my last breath, I'll strive.
To never end our love, because it is so strong,
And Eternity with you, could never be too long.


Well that's it. I always have a problem with rhythm. Another problem I have is making it rhyme and good at the same time. I think I should stop writing poetry haha.

<i>Sidenote: Amber is going to write a story for me. I truly wish I had her ability with words. Everything she writes is eloquently thought out and all of her stories enrapture me and come alive in my head. I think it's a great compliment to someone's work when the writing can take you out of your world and into theirs.</font></i>"

"event","Love and feelings and emotional crap make me want to rip out my heart and throw it at some unsuspecting bystander. Sure LOVE is great, but with it comes tons and tons of other shit that is completly unwanted. Jealousy? What is that crap? I truly didn't know what it was until about 2 years ago. I never had need of jealousy with the ex-husband, I know it's going to sound mean and concieted, but I truly knew he wasn't going anywhere. Most of me doesn't care about men checking other girls out, I do it too and it's fun to do together, but good lord there's a small part of me that wants to rip his eyeballs out and shove them in his nuts so he shall be forever blinded by pants. Ha! That's a great mental image. It's different with porn, I don't give a fuck about porn. Porn is porn and it's great to see other people naked and doing dirty things, who doesn't like that? Porn is harmless and benign and it's something we can share together, either laughing or getting hot and bothered over. Either way, it's all great fun.

Other things associated with love: insecurity, worrying over stupid shite, wondering if one day your significant other will come home smelling like some cheap whore or some hot man-meat, will you get tired of one another? I realize the last two fall under the second aforementioned category, but my hands seem to be faster than my brain and just kept on going. My point is, and I know it doesn't sound like it from what I said above, Valentine's Day is stupid and pointless. One day out of the year you buy candy and flowers and say ""I Love You's"", and buy 5 dollar cards that you probably didn't read, it's just pointless. I don't understand it. What does this have to do with jealousy and porn? nothing, I don't know where that came from. I'm so frustrated and there's noone to talk to so I decided to vent on here, because noone reads this drivel. Bah! I'm going to bed. Happy Valentine's Day!!! ha"

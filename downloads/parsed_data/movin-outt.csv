and desires that once were are no longer
i feel happy. no more searching. what i wanted is now here... but is it what i really do want? sometimes i scare myself and say no... but then the other time i think that what is right now actually is right. but i wonder for how long it will be right. i don't like thinking about prolonged time. time scares me a little. no- not time- trying to have set plans scares me. who knows where i'll be years from now- emotionally and physically. yet, i don't care to know. i want it to come at me in its own way. experience is something i want... in almost everything. i want to see things that i will not always get to see. i want to love being young. i never thought i would BE in love when i was young. i'm sure of this. i really do love him. i love most things about him. i love his sweetness and how he says stupid shit. i love how he calls me sexy when all i do is kiss him. the way he kisses me on the forehead when he's standing above me never seems to fail at grabbing my joy either. the stupid things he does no longer affects me- it only makes me continue to love him. but when we talk about the length of our relationship, things get rocky. he likes to think about the future and what's coming. i don't."

i've been in college for about 3 months- in the beginning i got along with my roommates really well. recently though, we got into a little fight. the other day my roomie katherine said that i called her fake. that was complete bullshit because i never said that and she's ttrying to start drama with me over it.
i'm so over drama bullshit i mean we're in college. get over yourself.

anyway, i haven't really been around them because i've been spending most of my time with my boyfriend chris and his roommates because they're way more chill.

i've decided that i think i'm going to be moving out of my room. i'm not sure when- either in a few weeks or next semester. i'm not sure what else there is to do.
it's just dumb because i shouldn't have to deal with this.
in the apartment i brought like 95% of the things in there. if i leave, they'll have nothing- which makes me laugh because they don't deserve any of my things anyway.

chris and his roommates have been so good to me
they told me that i can count on them for anything. they even offered to help move me out if i change rooms.

i love chris so much because he's so sweet. i'm so fucking lucky to have such a nice caring boyfriend and such good friends.

i haven't been in my room a lot so i haven't been able to write recently and it sucks.


but i want to get back into it.
and ps i started to take away my things.
lets see how they feel about that."

I looked over and saw him. 
his deep blue eyes were easily brought out by his smooth brown hair.
when he spoke his voice was not what was expected to be released from his lips.
but that didn't mean his voice was high and squeaky- it wAs rich as words flowed musically from his mouth. 
when he laughs his convincing laughter made you want to laugh along the way it invited you to.
there were over a million and fife thing I shouldve been doing but instead I was busy thinking about him. 
my face shined brightly as he came to my mind.
and yet, he probably wasn't someone I should have been thinking of for various reasons
that would make his identity too obvious if I stated them. 
I needed someone in my mms who didn't come with too many obstacles. 
 I sighed knowing I probably shouldn't have been pressing this.
I was already upset thinking aboutbotherbhings that saddened me."

i'm worried.
whether or not i should be worried is something else... yet i cannot help myself :/

i'm such a people person that i can get so easily disturbed by a little bit of unknowing...
let me explain. if something happens to me where a person doesn't tell me something but i find out, and i don't know much about it, crazy thoughts take over. what ifs overwhelm my mind and it just makes me so worried.


i'm like so worried right now and i can't even say if i should or shouldn't be because the fucking unknown is taking over.

[if the trait is carried by one or both of your parents.]<br />when you have CF, you have this defective gene and its protein product causes the body to produce <br />a thick mucus that the lungs cannot break down so it eventually will clog the lungs.<br />this protein product also takes away the body's natural ability to break down and absorb food <br />[that basically means- they cannot gain weight as easy as most people can so they have to eat fattening food and a lot of it to maintain a normal weight]<br /><br /><br />that is the basic summerization of this disease that my 5 year old cousin has.<br />the walk is May 20th starting &amp; ending at playland. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE- if you think you may be able to do it please tell me!! i'd love to get ATLEAST 3 people from our school [besides me and my family] to walk... and maybe more.<br /><br />with your help i can. =]<br />oh yeah btw- the median age for my cousin's life is 37. <br />i would love to see her live longer than that. <br />it is my lifetime goal to raise enough awareness of the disease and try to find a cure.<br />any questions- ask me. =] </div>"

2. Don't say who they are.
3. Feel free to comment, but don't confirm or answer anything.
4. Never discuss it again

1. you annoy the effin shit outta me like all the time. it sucks yo. but i've literally known you like all my life. i love you, although you are a bitch. we can talk about anything. and i mean ANYTHINGG!! i love you and always will. i always haveta forgive you because i see you almost everyday! i'm sorry i annoy you too, but hey, i guess its our jobs to annoy each other... right? until the day we die we will always be like sisters... we're close enough already.

2. ohh gosh. our time as friends hasnt been long, yet it feels like i've known you forever!! we've grown so close. we've been through soo much and niether of us will ever be able to forget any of it. you are the worse singer i know, but you're still amazing when you lalalala. i know we'll be biffers for lifee. =]
dont ever change. <33

3. oh man ! you and i have known each other for almost all of our lives. its crazy how time passes, isnt it? i hope we will keep our friendship going throughout our lives. i've learned from you and hopefully you've learned from me. we have the stupidest sarcasm & i make fun of you too much [which i'm sorry for btw]. we've both matured and know how to be silly and crazy and when. you are lovely my dear. please don't ever leave me.

4. oh gosh. i can't help but think of you. although you won't read this, and dont really care anymore i will never forget how close we used to be. we were best friends;;; you ruined your life, actually, he did. you were an amazing sweet girl, until something came up... i was always there to support you, even when i thought of giving up on you. you made me so scared and sad that i wanted to die. i wish the girl that was within you, my old best friend, would come back. but iknow she can't because of the one kid i truely come close to hating. i just wish things could be back to where they were, but there's no chance in hell that'll happen. i still love you<3

5. you are one of the sweetest girls i know. people have thought of you as bratty, but i beg to differ. you're so funny and we laugh about stupid things. we've known each other basically since 7th grade. from there on i just became better and better. although lately i've been lacking you, i love hanging out. we can have serious talks [which is a really good trait to have] but have stupid fun times too. your attitude is amazing;; you never talk about insecurities which is another lovely trait. you are just so idk what to call you that's just how lovely you are. <33


6. IS THAT THUNDER I HEAR?? haha lmao. this was probably our first joke ever, and yet it is still used! haha i remember when we first met in social studies in 6th grade and we're still friends. you would crack your knuckles in the middle of tests & i would look at you and glare. we've had soo much fun throughout the years and you've become soo much less shy. when you're hyper i love to watch you. when you come over we stuff you with sugar and sue gets mad at me for giving it to you. i loved how that one time we spent at least 4 nonstop days together and we didn't even fight or anything. you are getting easier to relate to and becoming more and more fun each time we chill. i'm glad i was the 2nd friend you made when you moved here and that we're still tightttt. ily<33  

8. its sad we barely chill. =[  for years now we've been separated in school. it sucks. well, it all started in 2nd grade.... haha not to bore anybody with my stories but i'll just give out the highlights;; we met in 2nd grade. i started hanging out with you and your little group. we became close. and we've continued getting close among the years. although i haven't always hung out with you and your group of friends, i knew you'd always be willing to take me in if i was having problems with other friends. i hate to make it sound like you were a fall back but in a way, it kind of has been like that. although you are soo sweet and fun, theres just been something holding us back from being as close as we should be. but nevertheless, we are still really good friends and those few times we do chill are just soo fun. i love you and love how you know about some good music. i hope the communication breakdown doesn't haveta happen again but i'm ready to sing if it does<33

9. although you are oh so antimyspace/livejournal i still haveta include you in this because you are becoming a really close friend. you are crazy cool and also have a passsionate side hidden in you, but of course i've seen it. you don't care what people think of you and what you say, goes. you are a loser [literally, because i always win] but that's okay. we've been on/off friends for about 2-3 years. we never really hung out until this year. and i'm soo happy that you're lazy because if you weren't, we wouldn't have lunch and be chillaxing soo much. you are soo fun and sweet. ily whore<33

"event","mmkay so basically- i'm really in a creative mood.

the problem is- i'm having a brain fart.

soo all my creativeness is stuck somewhere thats undefinable. 

i hate the fact that whenever i'm inspired [yeah this sounds stupid, but hear me out], i don't have paper or a pen. my mind creates the words, and yet they don't come out when i'm ready for them.

which totally sucks because basically, i daydream with poetry.
i talk to myself in my mind with literary devices and creativity but it becomes harder to write it sometimes.

oh yeah, & haleys vids make me jealous.
haha i wanna do one.
i think i'll start now. haha.

mahh brotha's band played [the first time me hearing them since Battle of the Bands]
and they are actually really good.
and the other bands were pretty good.
so it was enjoyable.
megan & aisha came over before and we chilled, and ate pizza. it was good b/c i hadn't hung out with megan in like years before that.
and jenny and christine went too so it was fun.

jenny and I are chilling tomorrow so i'm excited... we really havent chilled in a while either.

i was supposed to have a speech tourney tomorrow but i dont anymore since we have no judge, no ride and it would've only been me and leigh going anyways so yeah.
in a way, i'm happy b/c i NEED sleep!!!
but i'm also dissapointed because the only other speech tourney for this school year is next weekend and i cant go b/c i have madd stuff--> aunt's partyy AND all county.

i've never felt so tight and busy in my lifeee!

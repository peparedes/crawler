Now that I'm no longer in training at my job, it has become extremely stressful. Any minor mistake goes in your charts and is review after your 3 month probation period is over.  I was so pissed off over one of the mistakes because I didn't feel like it was a big deal. It was corrected before went to the next department, yet some evil bitch had to report it instead of bringing it to my attention.

We (my other co-works on the same shift) feel like we are being treated unfairly. In the past week, we have had some privileges taken away and been warned about other things, but when I go in tonight I will be asking for explanations for the new changes."

"event","Seriously, everyone that works at the Geek Squad station should be fired for being so stupid.  My computer's motherboard died and I was unable to save any of the data myself.  I took it in for repairs and got charged $160 for their unlimited data backup. They gave me a paper to check everything I wanted backed up. I checked all media files (mp3s, .jpeg, ect), desktop items, my favorites/bookmarks, and Outlook. They told me they would take out my harddrive bebfore shipping off to the manufacture for repairs. I get a called telling me they succeeded in backing up my data and that I could come pick it up and they were going to ship it off now.

What Geek Squad failed to tell me was that my harddrive was going to be thrown away after they backed up my data.  Obviously the manufacture  didn't expect them to throw away it either because they shipped it back to them without installing a new one. The Geek Squad shipped it back to them without telling me to have a new harddrive installed. All of this took more than a month to do, which is ridiculous.  I finally get my computer back and started putting the data back onto my harddrive, but my .pst file for Outlook and bookmarks from Firefox (only EI favorites were backed up and I don't even use EI) are no where to be found.

The next day I go back to Best Buy to ask about my missing bookmarks and .pst files, and one guy goes around like he's looking for information.  He finally comes back and looks at something on the computer and claims that ALL my files were backed up like the paper said. I asked him about the original harddrive and he said it had been trashed.  The paper I filled out clearly states, ""We strongly recommend that you keep your original storage device containing the original data for at least 90 days.""  He's acts like he has no idea what I'm talking about and asks me to bring in the data disc so he can check them for the files.

I'm going to back in there with the disc and I plan on filing a complaints and asking for the $30 the paper I filed out says they will reimburse me ""in the event that we cannot retrieve data from the media."" Being called 'Geek,' you should know how to find files on a computer and realize they people use more than one web browser."

"event","I've been having panic attacks about me or someone else close to me dying since I lost my best friend.  It has only gotten worse and it's starting to affect my health.  I've gained 15lbs and I have been sleeping a lot less.  I've had a headache everyday and  some kind of cardiac dysrhythmia from all the adrenaline.

More stress is being added on me because my mother is sick with something the doctors can't seem to diagnose correctly.  She has had this pain in her upper abdomen. It has been bothering her for a little more than a week.  It makes me nervous because my great aunt passed away last year after complaining about the same thing.

I don't know what I would do or where I would go if I lost my mom at this point.  It feels like she's my last close family member because I'm not really close to my siblings, due to the huge age difference.  I already feel alone because of this.  I don't have friends I can hang out with.

My other sister's health isn't so great either.  She hasn't taken care of herself proper for like a year.  She has lived with AIDS for nearly 20 years and now I feel like she's giving up.  She won't see a doctor or take her meds.  She's gone on a drug binge since her only daughter was arrested for something she didn't do.  It hurts to see her looking so ghastly."

After 3 long years of apply for job after job, I finally got two interviews. I think it's obvious I didn't get the first job (Office Assistant) because I showed up 15 minutes late.   Wasn't my fault.  The bitch that made the appointment told me 1:30pm, but interviewers said 1pm.  I thought I was arriving 15 minutes early, trying to make a good impression, but I ended up looking pathetic.   I was incredibly nervous because it was my first interview in like 3 years.  I think I did well and they seemed impressed, but I think it was the showing up late is what ruined it

The second interview (Season Clerk) wasn't really an interview at all.  It was just a bunch of papers to fill out.  My sister claims this is how they hire, but I don't know.  I took my photo for my ID, got finger printed, and told that they would call me when they are ready to hire. *shrugs*  With my luck job searching, I probably won't get this one either."

I first thought about skipping it, but then I knew I would never forgive myself.  I told myself I was going to be strong and not cry, but once I saw others crying I couldn't fight it.  I kind of broken down at the end and almost made myself sick.

I wanted to say a few words, but I knew I couldn't get through it without crying.  It was nice hearing the things people had to say about him.  I finally understand what people mean by, ""you never know how much someone means to you until they're gone.""  He was to every one despite he's sometime stubborn ways. He always listened and helped whenever there was a problem.  I never believed him when he used to tell me that he'll dead before/by age 30.  I wish I had spent more time with him.

I didn't go out to the burial site because I couldn't take anymore. I haven't talked to anyone since the funeral. I'm waiting for his sister to call me when the autopsy report comes in."

I've been crying on and off all evening. I'm just so hurt right now, crying for the last hour or so.  Everything just happened so suddenly.  I wish I had IMed him last night because we hadn't talked for a month.

I knew him for about 7 years and he was my only friend IRL, besides the people I talk to online.  He was the only person who really understood me.  We had so much in common, but were so different.  He was the only person I talked to on the phone and that really listened. Someone who knew all my secrets. Now I have no one.

I feel kind of guilty because I avoided him.  I was depressed and I didn't feel like talking.  Maybe he needed someone to talk to and I wasn't there when he needed me. I'll probably never know.

The house still hasn't sold and we still don't know why.  Everyone that comes to view it says they like it, but I guess not enough to buy it. We've moving things around to make it look more roomy. We've even dropped the price by 35,000. I don't know what's going on.

Sunday night a Bail Bondsman in a bulletproof vest comes to our house looking for my niece's husband.  The guy is pounding on our front window telling my mom to open the door.  He was hiding and my mom couldn't see anyone out there, so she opens the door thinking the security gate was lock, but it wasn't and the he puts a gun in her face. He's screaming at her asking where my niece's husband is and he just walks in the house, grabbing my mother by her arm. My mother is asking him to identify himself and he refuses.  

He starts to threaten my mom, saying that he'll take her house or that it won't go into escrow because she is hiding my niece's husband. He says he has proof that she talked to him and that our neighbors said that he was here.  He starts going through the house looking in closets and under the beds and threatens to shoot me if I get in his way.

My brother is driving by and sees two man climbing over our fence and stops to see what's going on.

"event","So I went to see Mariah Carey last week.  It was my '05 Christmas present from my sister.

Busta's set last about almost an hour, 55 minutes to be exact. He got the crowd really hyped up before Mariah came out. I think he got a little too sexual for the children in the audience. 

Mariah's segment started 30 minutes after Busta (I timed everything). I honestly don't see why people would complain about this. Do you know how long it takes to stand in line to get food or use the bathroom in a building of 10,000 or more people? Or how the complained about her costume changes that last exactly 2 minutes, a little one with the B stage because they had to clear the aisle of people rushing over. 

She sounded GREAT except during Vision of Love (my fav) her ear monitors stopped working and hit a few bad notes. She looked amazing too, even thinner in person and a big ""FUCK YOU"" to whoever disagrees. Mariah's sarcastic sense of humor kept the audience laughing. 

She had a few more technicalities with the lights while on the B stage (surely a critic will call this a diva moment). She had a different outfit for the B stage. Instead of the capri pants and bikini top, she wore this off the shoulders kind of tube top with a black skirt. 

Trey didn't sing any songs from his cd, just a few Luther songs, and Gnarls Barkley's ""Crazy"" which in my opinion sounded a hot mess. He doesn't the the voice for that kind of song. 

The set list was missing Make It Happen, but she sang the chorus of Joyride for a couple who was either getting married or had an anniversary...I don't know. i noticed that she sings chipmunk-ish/whiny during Heartbreak (original) & Fantasy. I think the voice lessons Mariah has been taking for her upcoming country film is affect her style because only a bad voice teacher would tell you to sing like that or with a whine to hit higher notes with ease. 

Reading reviews online....I don't see or hear what they do and I have no complaints about her. 

Oh this lady got so drunk she had to be carried down the stairs. Someone screamed out ""drunk bitch!"" as she was being wheeled away. A lot of people showed up already liquored up! It's no wonder she had to be carried. I swear I also smelled pot being smoked! The place reeked of alcohol, weed, and cheap perfume/cologne. 

Oh they also shut off the A/C when Mariah came out and oh boy.....that's when the funk came out. Also that fog/smoke sh!t they put into the air, I'm sure it affected Mariah's voice because it irritated mine. My throat got dry, scratchy, and hoarse and I didn't even scream!"

I finally got a call for a job after applying for 650 to 700 different jobs. It was with Quest Diagnostics in North Sacramento. I missed the first interview because when I got there no one could find anything about there being an appointment for my interview.  I traveled back out there to set up another appointment, but instead I got interviewed right on the spot and I was totally unprepared.  They were only hiring for the 3rd shift which is between like 8/9pm to 4/5am.  Even if I got hired, I wouldn't be able to make back and fourth because I don't drive and there would be no one to drive out there and pick up me at those times.  I told them that I would check in weekly for open spots on the first and second shift.

I went to Thunder Valley this past Saturday hoping to win a little something to help pay bills and to buy food.  I just ended up coming home very disappointed and even more depressed than I already was.

In about a week or two the house will got into foreclosure because we are already 2 or 3 payments behind.  We've had people who are interested in buying there house, but no actual buyers."

the next morning my nephew said his friend was shot in the butt and shoulder and a girl was shot in the arm.  i figured something happened earlier that night that caused this shooting and I was right,"

I would fantasize about the guy holding my family hostage and I would offer to have sex with him if it let my family go. And sometimes those fantasies would take into rape fantasies.  Is it weird to have rape fantasies or to fantasize about them?"

"event","Yep still struggling to make ends meet and still looking for a place to move.  The life insurance money helped us a little and a settlement my mom receieve, but not much.

My nephew, his gf, and two kids moved in with us for about 3 months and that was hell.  The boy needs serious helps; freaking illiterate hypochondriac.  And his gf isn't any better...dumb ass.  They moved after a short while when my sister and her family moved in.

My sister and her family moved in because of a conflict with her landlord.  She found a new place already, but with her living her it was stressful everyday. My mom did nothing, but complain and complain everyday.

I've taking several state exams, but I've had no call backs.  I've applied to several locations for a job in the medical field and received no call backs or letters.  I've submitted my resume to local clinics that weren't hiring, but wanted to keep my resume on file.

I'm starting to think I'm being descriminated against because I should get at least one call back after applying at more then 30 places.  I'm going to start applying online instead of in person."

Since my great aunt passed away and my mom isn't taking care foster kids we don't have enough money to pay our bills.  My mom put our house on the market a few days ago.  I don't know what we're going to do or where we're going to go once the house is sold.  We haven't found a place yet because my mom doesn't feel like looking. If I could find a job, I would be able to help pay the bills but I haven't gotten one call back yet.  The royalty checks I get from our property aren't good enough because they aren't reliable and they don't come every month."

"event","On Saturday I went to my very first club and I was so nervous.  102.5 KSFM was holding the party at the Pyramid and my niece was on the guest list and she took me with her.  After about an hour driving around looking for a park and we when finally found one it was about 8 blocks away.  When I got out of the car, my hand touched bird shit that was on the car.  That was only the beginning of the night.  I went into this place to wash my hand and the asshole said I couldn't wash my hand or even have a fucking napkin because I wasn't a customer.  We have to walk 2 more blocks to find a bath room.

We finally go to the club and there a waiting line.  We got behind these flaming black dudes who were annoying as hell.  They were picking the girls in front of them because I guess they were rude to them.  They were takling about them so bad, it was embarassing.  I just told my niece to stand back and not to even look at them because if something happened I wanted to make sure we were out of the way.  I'm glad they didn't start anything with us, because I'd have to lay at least one of them out and run lol.

We finally got inside and it wasn't what I expected.  It was pretty empty and hardly anyone was dancing, but maybe because it was early.  I guess the girls that worked there were the ones up of the tables.  They looked like totally whores with their hot pants on and fucked up body shapes.  One girl's body looked like a can of pillsbury biscuits that had busted.  We were only there a little over an hour because where we were sitting, a shit load of roaches just started coming out of nowhere and everyone started screaming and running."

"event","So everything has been going well so far...I guess, still a little drama here and there.

I've been off Paxil for a few months now and I had been fine up until the last few weeks.  I'm afraid I might be falling into depression again.  I've been feeling like I'm all alone and like I have nothing to live for.  I don't like feeling like this and I don't want to take anymore pills
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SACRAMENTO COUNTY - Sheriff's investigators are looking for a man wanted in connection with an August homicide in Vintage Park.

Detectives believe the suspect, Sirtice Melonson, 20, was attempting to take the victim's car, he said.

Navnil Chand, 27, was shot multiple times in the upper torso in a car at Caymus Park on Vintage Park Drive about 11:10 p.m. Aug. 5, said Sgt. R.L. Davis, spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.

Chand died at the scene, and a man who was with him was shot in the hand, Davis said.

Anyone with information is asked to call homicide detectives at (916) 874-5115 or Crime Alert at (916) 443-HELP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The detectives stopped by our house the other day wanting to speak to several of my family members about a homicide that happened back in August.  Some of my nieces and nephews got tied into this whole mess, because the police got their phone records and they talked to the victim and the suspect the same day of the murder. The police were thinking they had something to do with the murder all because of one of my nieces bestfriend.  She started telling lies from the beginning and now the police think she had the guy killed."

"event","So my mom came back home on Sunday and she's doing much better.  She had pulmonary edema (congestive heart failure) & pneumonia. Luckily I called 911 in time or she could have died.  She hasn't smoked a cigarette since Friday night and thats a good thing. I don't know how long that will last, she always has some excuse for her to have one.

On Saturday night, my niece went out with her sister and come back here about 3:30 in the morning with her bf & sisters.  I was kind of upset about her bringing him here so late, but they had been drinking so I let it slide.  My other nieces went to sleep and I thought my niece and her bf were going to sober up and go back to his house or just sleep on the couch.  I came back in the living room and there she was bringing him down the hall way.  I'm like um, ok wtf?  Telling me that she was going to sleep in my mothers bed with her bf.  I was like ""OH HELL NO, thats going to happen.""  I put my hand in her face and I knew she got made about it because she starting saying ""oh its nothing, it never nothing"" with an attitude.  Seriously I don't know what the fuck she was thinking bringing him here in the first place and then have the audacity to try to take him to sleep in my moms bed.

First off, she is still married to her husband.  Just because you've been separated for a year doesn't make it ok in my eyes.  Secondly I didn't invite him to stay all night.  And third, I don't even know him like that to even ask him to stay here.  I met him once and what I've heard about him, I don't really like him.  He sounds just like another user like her husband.  The guy has 4 kids, no job, and only God knows what else."

"event","Last night my mother started complaining of an intense numbing pain in her left shoulder that moved all the way down her arm. My immediate thought was heart attack.  I give her an aspirin just in case and then called 911. I checked her pulse rate and blood pressure, her resting heart rate was 98 and her blood pressure was 220/180. When the EMT's got here, they did an EKG and said it was normal and decided to take her in to get everything checked out.  My mom was diagnosed with pneumonia before all of this, but wasn't getting better with the antibiotics they gave her.  They wouldn't let any of us in with her, they told us that everyone has to wait in line to see people in the back that just came in, although they were allowing other people to go in the back with people that had just came in and I thought it was fucked up that they weren't us letting us see our mom.  She could have been dying and wanting to say her last words to us.  We were told we had to wait 20 minutes for people who just arrived by ambulance. The guy at the front desk started being very disrespectful towards my sister, he starting talking loudly with an attitude.   My sister was just asking questions and even said thank you and he yelled, ""YOURE WELCOME"" at her.  I told him, ""You don't have to be an asshole.""  I know he wanted to say something back, he got mad, turned all red and slammed his hand down on the desk.  He left after all that too.

My eldest niece and I were going in the back since we have the medical degrees, but they said only one of us could go in the back to see my mother, even though everyone else was taking 3 or 4 people with them in the back. I sent my niece first, because I was too distraught about the situation. She went to get information about of what was going on and what was to be done. When my sister tried going in the back without asking, she was stopped.  The other people were just walking in the back as the doors opened. We were also the only black family there at the time too.  I felt insignificant because we were treated differently. Meanwhile another 20-30 minutes have gone by from waiting in line.

My niece came out and explained to us that her EKG was normal, her blood pressure was extremely high, she had fluid in her lungs, and that she had a fever.  The doctor claimed the pain in her left arm was from the fluid in her lungs, I don't believe it.  They gave her vicodin for the pain, after 2 hours the pain hadn't subsided.  They give her 4mgs of morphine, after 45mins she was still in just as much pain.  They gave her an antibiotic drip and it helped to stop all of her coughing.  She felt better since the coughing stopped, but she was still hurting.  They said there were a lot of rooms and then all of a sudden there were no rooms.  We stayed a few more hours to see how she felt and if they found a room.

Now while we waited, we noticed that all the other black families (6) that came in were still in the waiting room.  Everyone else who had come in late had been seen first.  *sighs* it just pisses me off.  Anyway they didn't find a room for my mom, so we decided to leave and let her get some rest.  Some of my siblings went back at a later time to check on mom.  They didn't find her a room until after 12 today, even though we went up stairs and checked for available rooms on the same floor as she is now.

On our way home today this crazy motherfucker swerved in front of us as we took off from the light.  As we traveled down the street he kept swerving back and forth in front of us and wouldn't let us pass.  When he would get in front of us, he'd slam on his brakes.  I was so mad I was shaking; words can't begin to describe how I felt.  We all started cussing him out and he wouldn't even look at us with his fucking bitch made ass. Don't fucking play with my life, I've been in one car accident and don't plan on being in another one on some asshole play games.  I swear if he would have said ANYTHING, I would have busted his head to the fucking white meat.  I don't know what the fuck his problem was.....maybe it was because we were in a Lincoln Navigator we our music cranked up and he was in some old Nissan Altima."

"event","<center>Think about them one at a time BEFORE going on to the next one. IT DOES MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, especially the thought at the end.

1. Falling in love.
   Too scared to scared to fall in love again to find out.

2. Laughing so hard your face hurts.
   As much as it hurts, yes. Definitely feels good. 

3. A hot shower.
   No. Takes too long to cool off after, I'll start sweating.

4. No lines at the supermarket.
   Only when I'm in a rush.  I like to read the magazine whil in line.

5. A special glance.
   Only if the person is cute :P

6. Getting mail
   I rarely get my mail if I don't ask for it.

7. Taking a drive on a pretty road.
   Yes. I seem to be the only one that takes notice.

8. Hearing your favorite song on the radio.
   Yes, it just makes the day better

9. Lying in bed listening to the rain outside.
   I'd rather watch it rain.

10. Hot towels fresh out of the dryer.
    Love to bundle up in them.

11. Chocolate milkshake (or vanilla or strawberry!)
    Only homemade milkshakes.

12. A bubble bath.
    I used to, but not in this little tub I have now :(

13. Giggling.
    I do it all the time, mostly by myself...no one to share the moment with.

14. A good conversation.
    Always.  I don't talk much though, I lose my voice quickly.  Strange I lose it from talking instead of singing.

15. The beach.
    Haven't been to the beach for years....I'd love to go again. Gotta get in shape, I wanna learn to surf one day.

16. Finding a 20 dollar bill in your coat from last winter.
    YES! And never remember leaving there.  I should check now.

17. Laughing at yourself.
    Yes, embrassing at times too.

18. Holding a newborn baby. 
    I want one of my own :)

19. Midnight phone calls that last for hours.
    I'm usually pissed if I get calls past 10pm, even though I'm not asleep at that time.  Don't ask why, I don't even know.

20. Running through sprinklers.
    I miss this feeling, maybe I'm afraid my hair would frizz up.

21. Laughing for absolutely no reason at all.
    Yeah and usually people think I'm crazy.

22. Having someone tell you that you're beautiful.
    Only if they mean it, I'm never sure when they are.

23. Laughing at an inside joke.
    All the time, amongst friends it's one of the best feelings.

24. Friends.
    Something I lack in real life.  Friends online are great people, but I don't feel they know the real me even though I share everything.

25. Accidentally overhearing someone say something nice about you.
    and I dont think I have ever had that happen....I read it in letters addressed to other people or was there in person when it was said to someone else

26. Waking up and realizing you still have a few hours left to sleep.
    I hate it, because I know I'll over sleep.

27. Your first kiss (either the very first or with a new partner).
    First kiss was icky, so no.

28. Making new friends or spending time with old ones.
    Making new friends makes me feel good for many reasons.  When I spend time with old friends, there is this feeling of reassurance I get.

29. Playing with a new puppy.
    Fun & cute until it starts chewing on things

30. Having someone play with your hair.
    It's a very relaxing feeling

31. Sweet dreams.
    Always, very few bitter ones.

32. Hot chocolate.
    mmm chocolate.

33. Road trips with friends.
    Always wanted to go on a road trip, needs friends willing to go.

34. Swinging on swings.
    Been a while...parks don't have the big swings anymore.

35. Making eye contact with a cute stranger.
    Sexy, but oh so nerve wrecking.

36. Making chocolate chip cookies.
    If I don't start eating the dough.

37. Having your friends send you homemade cookies.. 
    Not a good thing when they can't cook O_O funny to joke about. 

38. Holding hands with someone you care about.
    Usually I'm pulling the someone around when I hold their hand.

39. Running into an old friend and realizing that some things (good or bad) never change.
    Oooh don't know....most of them have been bad...bad enough to make me ask what happened.

40. Watching the expression on someone's face as they open a much desired present from you.
    Rarely happens, I never know what to get for anyone.

41. Watching the sunrise.
    Mirthfully & well anticipated moment.

42. Getting out of bed every morning and being grateful for another beautiful day.
    I realized that I take it for granted and must learn to be more grateful for what I have.

43. Knowing that somebody misses you.
    Very sweet feeling.

44. Getting a hug from someone you care about deeply.
    Now there is something I miss.  I only get hugs from my little nieces & nephews.

45. Knowing you've done the right thing, no matter what other people think.
    Not always a proud feeling but knowing I've done that right thing makes it ok</center>"

No job yet.  Maybe I should call the school to help me out, because I'm not enjoying doing this alone.  Maybe I should just go back to school, I don't know.  Maybe I should start some kind of home business.

I'm sick of my family...if I had money I'd move away.  I'd probably happier without the everyday drama involving them.  I've been comptemplating moving away but I don't know....where would I go?

In the past few months we've had 4 foster kids come and go.  I liked Robert, 15 y/o, even though there was something mysterious about him.  He was Mexican (so he said), but I swear he was Asian.  I forget the boy's name that came after him...he was mentally challened, 10 y/o, very sweet child.  Then there was James, 15 y/o, gald he left quickly.  He was a shit talker and always seemed to get beat up at school.  And then there was Denzel, 10 y/o, he looked nothing like A Denzel.  I'm not sure if he had something wrong with him or he was just never taught anything.  He was a complusive liar.

I went to the Monarchs game with Trevor and friends.  I enjoyed everything but the basketball playing.  I lose interest quickly if something exciting doesn't happen.

I went shopping for more shirts to wear, because the color is starting to fade out of the others.  We have really hard water out here, you can smell chlorine & sulfur in it.  It's not only affecting my clothes but my skin & hair are in bad shape.  My skin is really dry and none of the moisturizers I have are working.  My face is all broken out and it looks rough.  My hair is really hard and dull.  It had like hard water deposits on it and no shampoo or conditioner is working on it.  I've been looking for water filters/softners online. I'm going to home depot in the morning about one.

I also bought furniture for my room now that I have it back, my sister finally moved out.  My mom has been trying to put things in my room that she likes and now that has become an issue.  I told her I was gonna paint my room black if she doesn't back off.  I got a 32in LCD HDTV on sale.  My mattress is so soft and I got that for half off."

I won' bother going to the doctor because they'll just tell me that I have sinus drainage thats causing all of this.  They'll take me to take allergy pills and drinks lots of fluids.

The last time I had this was in nov. or dec.  I ended up having it for a fucking month and a half. I could barely speak and I had trouble swallowing.  Every morning was worse.  I was waking up coughing & sneezing out up bloody yellow mucus.

I still have the some of the pills they gave me from last time.  I'll start taking those, but if it gets any worse I'll be force to go to the doctor and if they give me any shit, I'm going off.





Have you guys picked up Mariah Carey's new album?  She sold over a million already!  This is the only cd of her that I don't skip tracks on."

"event","I talked to this really nice guy last night.  He seemed like a really great guy.  I think I talked to him for about 3 or 4 hours.  He was really into and I didnt realise it until he told me.  He wanted to meet me, so we decided to exchange pics.  He sent his first <a href=""http://l00016.myspace.com/00016/34/30/16190343_l.jpg"">pic</a> and I thought he was hot. So I replied with my pic, he said I was cute....he sent more pics and I did the same.  I guess I wasn't cute in the other pics because he totally ditched me before the first date!

I don't understand....he told me I was the nicest guy he ever talked to online  He said I had a great personality and that I sounded and looked cute.  What did I do wrong?  Am I ugly?  I'm so confused.

"event","I'm sick of my fucking family.  They talk too fucking loud, gossip all the damn time, and judge people before they know them.  They need to get a fucking life.  They obviously have too much time on their hands.  Do something productive instead of sitting around waiting for shit to happen.

I am the only one out of the children my mom has who has never did any type of drug.  My sisters and brother are all fucked up.  They will never be right.  I feel like I'm the only child.  I might as well be, because none of them seem to be concerned about my mother.  They weren't too concerned when my father was laid dying in the hospital.

Last Saturday the stupid foster kids run away for no fucking reason.  They got the idea from someone they my mom was getting rid of them.  They spilled an entire can of paint on the carpet.  My mom was so upset she cried when they got paint all over the carpet.  It was things building over the past few months that they have done that also upset her.   She took them to Home Depot to get something to remove the paint.  She waited an hour for them to come out of the store, she had them paged.  They were nowhere to be found.

The next day Steven calls crying talking about he wants to come home. Robert left him, he had family he could go with.  Steven has no one.  If it were me, I would told him he should stay out there longer.  This is what he wanted, deal with it.  Doing drugs, stealing, and thinking his friends would be there for him if he went to juvy.  They need a fucking reality check."

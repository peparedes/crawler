But ill tell you what happened during my weekend, on friday i came home from school then went to Bradenberg to play some basketball with some sweet kids like Kristen --> Mike --> Liz --> Ethan --> Schafer --> Kevin --> Aaron --> Brandie and lots of other people. It was pretty sweet. Then from there i went to kristens house and we went on the computer and did somethings then we went outside and humg out with mike and schafer and all the neighbors, then ehtan came over and we all played basketball then some neighborhood tag with three new people that came = Taylor --> Harmony --> And Erin and then we walked them home a talked about a lot of things then when we were walking back home i guess mike and the three girls got chased by this one guy? Then umm after that we went to my house to pick up my things and then i spent the night at kristens house, from there we woke up bc of liz calling asking to go to brandenberg again so then we ate breakfast kristen drove me home and then we all headed up to brandenberg. We played some more basketball. Then this is the interesting part. We all started this game with this one frunk guy, you could honestly tell that he was drunk because his eyes were bloodshot and he smelt like alcohol. from there i got hit but him almost clobbered, then he fouled adam like crazy. finally adam got pissed enough to say something, and the guy wenyt balistic! he was cussing at adam. so then that set me off so i started to cuss the fuck out of the guy i fucking said every bad word there was. he was one fucking bastard. from there we all quit the game, grabbed all our stuff and walked down the pier. of course when we came back the guy was still there, so we all just minded are own business and played some basketballl. Then i left from banderberg took like an hour shower, and then left to spend the night at ginas with kriste. 

 It was soo fun we pranked called a bunch of ppl. then mike came over and we watched some of the pistons game, went out side and walked around all over, went to ethans house and played red light green light, then we left from ethans, kristen and mike went home, then me a gina went downstairs and talked to this one sweet kid named jon, from there i called all these random numbers and ACTUALY had a 15 minute converstaion with this one mexican, he asked me all these questions and i asked alot too it was soo funy
then i started to call the operator and ask for places like taco bell, macdonalds,walmart meijers, burgerkind, 7-11 and wendys. it was soooooooo funny. then when i called taco bell i had a converstaion with the lady on how to get a jobb there, without college, and then i had a 5 minute conversation with the operator on how to get a job as a operator and they told me to call comcast lmaoo. After that we crashed, woke up ate some doughnuts, then went on the computer, then watched the littel rascalls then i left, came home took a shower and then did my homeowrk. and now im here typing this =]

Leave me some comments peopless. I will love you forever, SERIOUSLY. Cheer me upp."

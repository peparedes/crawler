"event","Well I got that DJ slot at the college radio station.  I'm on 103.5 FM from 1600-1900 on Wednesdays.  My first show was yesterday and I was <i>not</i> happy with my performance.  I did not have nearly enough music to do a good job, but hopefully I can get hold of some more.  Jim, if you could possibly burn me your entire industrial/ebm collection (in mp3 form, I can burn them as audio CD's myself at home) I'd be most appreciative, I <b>need</b> more music by this coming Wednesday or I'm fucked."

You don't really care much<br>about people since no one was particularly nice<br>to you and now you want revenge for their<br>cruelty. You're always alone unless forced to<br>be with other people and you love to cause<br>trouble. You feel depressed a lot and don't<br>have something that could cheer you up like<br>most people. You don't find joy in people or<br>the arts or any item or some sort. You have<br>darker desires and you're very secretive.<br>(please forgive me if you cannot see the pics.<br>I'm having some difficulty with them.

<i>""And The Phoenix's cycle had reached<br>zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He<br>emerged from his own ashes, to be forever<br>immortal.""</i>

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

As a member of Form 0, you are a determined<br>individual.  You tend to keep your sense of<br>optomism, even through tough times and have a<br>positive outlook on most situations.  You have<br>a way of looking at going through life as a<br>journey that you can constantly learn from.<br>Phoenixes are the best friends to have because<br>they cheer people up easily.

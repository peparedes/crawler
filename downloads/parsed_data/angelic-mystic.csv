You are neither good nor evil. You're too complicated to be explained so easily.<br />
You have a dark side, and your lust sometimes gets the better of you. And your temper is notoriously violent.<br />
<br />
But you also have a softer side to you. You are compassionate, sensitive, and capable of deep love.<br />
You are also very intelligent and witty. You enjoy verbal sparring as much as physical sparring.

"event","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling of my basement apartment. I looked at the clock, only 4 o&#39;clock. I still had another hour before I had to be up. I rolled back over to go back to sleep when the knock came. Again?<br /><br />&ldquo;Damnit!&rdquo; I snarled crawling out of my humungous California king bed, looking back longingly at Simon sleeping peacefully. &ldquo;I&#39;m not ready to be up yet.&rdquo;<br /><br />I jerked the door back, staying behind it since the sun hadn&#39;t set yet. &ldquo;Come in and it had better be important.&rdquo;<br /><br />&quot;Ms. Gypsy Love?&rdquo; a soft voice said. &ldquo;My name is Alex Hitchens, from Hitchens and Sons, I have something for you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hitchens and Sons? You&#39;re from that anti-vampire law firm! What are you doing here?&rdquo; I blurted out and slammed my door closed. I stood there with my robe partially open so the man, not much more than a kid really, had a very clear view of my cleavage.<br /><br />The little short man jumped back and held a cross up in front him like I was going to hurt him. &ldquo;I have some paperwork to deliver to you, <i>Ms. </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Love.&rdquo;</span><br /><br />&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Then put the cross down and hand it here, Mr. Hitchens.&rdquo; I snarled. The cross was glowing and it was starting to hurt. He didn&#39;t put the cross down but I saw his hand extend out beyond where the glow of the cross was, I snatched the papers from him. &ldquo;Now get out!&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-style: normal;"">He ran.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Walking back to the bedroom, I unfolded the papers and almost passed out. They were a summons to court. Jackie&#39;s family was suing me for<br />wrongful death because Jackie hung herself in the instituition they put her. Apparently, they were claiming it was my fault that she went bat shit crazy when I was attacked by a psycho serial killer vampire.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&quot;What the fuck?!&rdquo; I screamed as I walked through the bedroom door.</span><br /><br />&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Gypsy, cher</span><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&eacute;, what is it?&rdquo; Simon asked sitting up on the bed. I threw the papers at him and sat down hard on the edge of the bed. </span></font><br /><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&quot;This stupid prejudice shit against vampires just keeps popping up. It&#39;s like coprolite at an archaeological dig, I just can&#39;t seem to fucking avoid it!&rdquo; I&nbsp; screamed into my hands. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do about this?&rdquo;</span></font><br /><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">It&#39;s ok, cher&eacute;, we&#39;ll figure it out.&rdquo; Simon said wrapping his arms around me. &ldquo;I promise, we&#39;ll figure this out.&rdquo; </span></font></span></p><br /><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strike><br />This has been my entry for <lj user=""therealljidol"" /> week 3.&nbsp; The topic this week was &quot;coprolite&quot;.&nbsp; Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed&nbsp;it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post a link to voting as soon as it&#39;s up and any support you can give is always appreciated.<br />"

"event","<font color=""#000000"" size=""12""></font>Gypsy's back.  Last week left her in a very bad situation, not sure if this week is much of an improvement.

<lj-cut text=""Icarus Rising"">
The hair on the back of my neck stood on end.  How in the hell had this monster found me?  My heart took off like Hermes in a foot race.  I looked down at Simon's body, he was unconscious but alive, that was one good thing.

""You smell lovely, little one,"" he said.  God, this guy was nuts on top of being a demon.  Great.

""Thank you,"" I said, kneeling down to try and wake Simon.  As soon as my hand touched his shoulder his hand wrapped around my wrist in a death grip.  I looked in his face and saw nothing but terror.

""Gypsy, run,"" he whispered so softly that I could barely hear him, ""it's him.  It's the boy.  It's one of the Twins, Gypsy!""  He was all but screaming at the end.

The male twin, the father of every vampire walking the earth.  We are so screwed. How in the hell was I supposed to fight this?  I've got to get us out of here I thought but I wasn't sure I could.  He was so big and so strong.  I just didn't think I could do it.

""Don't bother running.  I'll just follow you again,"" he said still standing in the door way.  He hadn't moved at all.  ""Why were you following me?""

""Because you're killing people.  You have to stop.""

""Why?  Humans are just food for our kind.  Do we not kill that which we eat?""

""There are other ways, Lord Father,"" Simon said softly from the floor.  ""We live in harmony with the humans now.  We do not have to hide ourselves anymore.""

Something about what Simon said pissed the demon off.  he threw his head back and roared, the sound was a blood curdling bellow.  As he roared, the same large leathery wings sprouted from his back.  His wings beat against the air and his feet slowly left the ground.  My god, he was flying.  Flying!

I grabbed Simon's hand and dragged him to his feet.  We were getting out of there.  We ran out the back door.  Simon lead us straight towards the back fence.  I wasn't sure what he was planning, if he thought we were just going to run straight through it, until he yelled jump.  Jump?  What do I look like?  A kangaroo?  I didn't know what he was thinking but I jumped anyway.

I felt the muscles in my legs bunch, coiling like a spring.  With barely an effort I pushed off straight up in the air.  before I could blink I was soaring 30ft above the ground.  I didn't think anything could have surprised me more than the fact that Burns was on of the Twins.  Boy, was I wrong.  I could fly!  Holy shit, I could fly!  This must be what Icarus felt like before the sun melted his wings.  For the span of one heartbeat I felt amazing, like I could take on all of Hell and win.  That thought brought me quickly back to reality; one piece of Hell was right behind me and I don't think he was please with the path his ""children"" had taken in his absence.

What was I supposed to do about this?  So, I could fly?  If he got his hands on me he could throw me around like a rag doll.  What good was flying against strength like that.  I had a thought, I wasn't sure it would work but a banshee and a werewolf added to the mix just might even the odds.  I had to get us there, I looked down at the city spread out below us and tried to figure out where I was.  Once I spotted something I recognized I made my way from there.  I wasn't really having any problem with flying; landing was a completely different story.  To be completely honest, I fell on my face.  I didn't wast any time getting up though.  Before even half a second had passed I was through the door.  Vince caught me this time and he didn't fall over.

""Get ready for it!"" I yelled unwinding from Vince and turning to face the door.  I could see debris being stirred as Burns winged his way in.  ""All hell is about to break lose.""

Simon and I crouched low.  Vince shifted, the fur of his wolf flowing gracefully over his skin.  Michaela trilled slightly and Polasky just squared his shoulders.

""Polasky, what are you doing?""

""Oh no, girl, I'm not letting my team walk into the jaws of hell without me.""  I could only shrug; once Polasky made up his mind there was no changing it.

I had only enough time for one more thought before we turned as a group to face the bad guy.  At least my sweet, loveable, entirely too humanly breakable mother wasn't here.  After that I could think of nothing but surviving the fight.

"event","Gypsy's back with a big problem. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Oh we are soooo screwed...""> <br />I was crouching in the shadow of an old oak tree with my lunch still slurping out of the bag and down my throat when I saw him. I'd spent the last two weeks looking for the man walking into the building in front of me. He didn't smell right though; he didn't smell human. I caught the faint but very distinct scent of sulfur on the air. Demon, I thought, but how? They're not supposed to be able to come above and they're definitely not supposed to look so damned yummy. <br /><br />The man in front of me was immensely tall, pale blond, his face was well built like an artist had worked on him especially. His deep set eyes gave him a look almost of sorrow but there was something in them that warned that he had never felt sorrow over anything and never would. <br /><br />I blinked and came back to reality there was something vaguely familiar about this mark in a very unsettling way. Almost like a nightmare that drifts away when you wake up, you can only remember pieces. Something about him made me afraid, badly afraid. Whatever it was, I had to ignore it; I had a job to do. I had to bring him down. <br /><br />I flipped open the file on my lap Christian Burns had been a very bad boy lately. Three deaths already known to be his work and four more believed to be his. Again the cops were at a loss. He looked like just another human but there definitely was something other about him. He always seemed to know when the police were coming for him and was never there. The bodies just kept piling up. <br /><br />Since they couldn't catch him, Tampa PD called Polasky. The case got passed down to me. So far I hadn't been able to even catch a glimpse of him, until tonight. The picture didn't do him justice. But finally here he was. It was just too easy, it wasn't right; I could feel it deep in my gut. <br /><br />I finished off the bag with a gulp and stuffed it back in the pack I'd brought with me. I stood slowly looking over the building Burns had walked into. A simple looking warehouse, one large door and a smaller one. Red bricks made up the face. I could get in easy enough but it would be loud. I moved out of the shadow to look around the rest of the building. I could take my time, I had all night. As I stepped into the light of the street lamp, something shot out and grabbed my throat. <br /><br />The face was in shadow but I could smell the sulfur again. Somehow, Burns had gotten the drop on me. He stepped in to the circle of light and smiled at me. A sweet smile that said plainly that he was the cat and I was the canary. I tried to break free but he was so strong. I hadn't found much that was stronger than me since I had become a vampire. I definitely didn't like this. <br /><br />His fingers flexed slightly and my air was completely cut off. He smiled again, and then he spoke. &quot;Silly child, did you really thing you could hide from me, the oldest of you?&quot; His voice was smooth and rich as fresh butter. He threw me back from him with just a flick of his wrist, the sulfur smell getting stronger, he was angry. I had found him when no one else could. <br /><br />I hit the wall hard enough to crack the bricks and knock the wind out of me. My head snapped back against the wall and I saw stars. In was stunned for barely a moment and when my head cleared, he was waiting for me. I knew I'd never be able to win against him, not alone. I began slowly backing away from him, never looking away. I kept creeping backwards until there was about 100 yards between us and I felt sure I could get away, he was strong but not fast. I stood fully and looked that the man in front of me. <br /><br />I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The smooth beautiful face was melting away revealing a horrifying image. The true form of Christian Burns was as terrifying as the other was beautiful. Red skin that was lined with deep black scars that looked like claw marks running diagonally across his face. The skin itself looked like leather. Great black leathery wings sprouted from between his shoulders and horns grew from his forehead. I'll admit it, I stopped escaping and stared at the beast in front of me. I screamed, he roared, and I ran like a little dog with my tail between my legs. I didn't know why but I knew if I didn't get out of there, I was dead. <br /><br />I didn't know where I was going, all I knew is that I had to run. I ended up back at the office. Michaela was there and she caught me as I came through the door. I ran right straight through her and we both hit the ground. I was beyond out of my mind with fear. I tried to tell her what I'd seen but I couldn't make my voice work, all I could do was scream. Polasky came out of his office and helped Michaela carry me to my desk. When I finally screamed myself out and could tell them what had happened there were both silent and pale as death. <br /><br />&quot;What was it?&quot; Michaela trilled. <br /><br />&quot;A demon, I think. I didn't think they could come up here.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Neither did I, girl, neither did I,&quot; Polasky said. &quot;This is going to open up a whole heap of trouble for us. if we've got demons walking around that can throw a vamp around like a ragdoll things are going to get real ugly real fast.&quot; <br /><br />Polasky told me to go home, I'd had enough excitement for one night. Instead of going home, I went to Simon's. I just didn't think my mom would understand what had happened tonight. I knew Simon would, I knew he would understand the fear. When I got there I told him everything about Burns that I could remember. He held me while I cried the rest of the terror out and finally stopped shaking. When I looked up his white shirt was stained with the faintly red traces of my tears. All I could so was laugh. <br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I gasped between laughs. <br /><br />&quot;For what, ma cher?&quot; he asked. <br /><br />&quot;I ruined your shirt,&quot; I howled hysterically laughing. I guess that was the cost of crying non stop for almost an hour. I stopped when someone knocked on the door. My new found paranoia (product of the job) took over and I got ready for a fight. Simon went to answer the door and I could hear his voice faintly as he asked who it was. The next thing I knew Simon was flying backwards to land on his coffee table and Burns was stepping through the walkway into the living room. <br /><br />&quot;I found you.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Fuck!&quot;&nbsp; That was all I could say.<br /></lj-cut> <br /><hr /><br /><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">This has been my entry for week 8 of </span><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif?v=1"" /></span></a></span><span style=""font-size: x-small""><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><b>therealljidol</b></span></a></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">&nbsp;&quot;First World Problem&quot;.

"event","Gypsy is taking a break this week. May I introduce to you Miss Jolie La Veau. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""The Year of the Vampire""> <br />&quot;Be still, Jolie,&quot; the house Mistress scolded applying something to her back.<br /><br />&quot;Forgive me, Ma'am&quot;, Jolie apologized quietly.&nbsp; Watching the smoke curl away from her, the girl&nbsp;lifted her lip slightly.&nbsp; The antibiotic cream stung her back where the whip bit through to the blood.&nbsp; She sighed as another shudder of ecstacy rolled through her just at the thought of <em>him</em>.&nbsp; Jolie had never thought to see herself putting her darker desires to work for her.&nbsp; She had never even heard of a professional slave before, people who dominate professionally but not submitting.&nbsp; She had certainly never thought to find herself so completely absorbed by a client.&nbsp; She often was surprised when the comparison between him and another would occur in a session.&nbsp; No one had ever been able to bring her so far past her boundaries and still send her body soaring and singing with pleasure.<br /><br />&quot;He really did a number on your back this time,&quot; the Mistress clucked motheringly, Jolie just smiled with a contented sigh.<br /><div style=""text-align: center"">~*~*~*~</div><br />Gabriel, a sadist beyond compare, had a taste for blood and liked the way Jolie healed without scars.&nbsp; He could see her week after week, break her skin cruelly with a whip or even a knife, whatever he wanted, and she always returned to him with perfectly pure clean skin.&nbsp; That perfect milky&nbsp;smoothness was his undoing.&nbsp; He wanted her.&nbsp; Wanted to take her for his own but he had not yet indulged himself, made himself resist the urge to bury himself in her tender flesh.&nbsp; He had tasted the sweetness that ran in her veins, sampled the tangy heat of her sex and knew the change in smell and taste as she neared her climax.&nbsp; This last time had almost broken his will but he knew if he did he would never be able to let her leave him to go to another as he had so many times before.&nbsp; Just the thought of owning her fully made his stomach tighten, his balls ache, his mouth water, but worst of all it made his fangs drop.&nbsp; One thousand years and never had a girl affected him like Jolie.&nbsp; If only he could get her away from that over bearing bitch Amanda.<br /><br />&quot;Amanda, I will give you all I have if you would just give her to me,&quot; Gabriel hissed in frustration two weeks later.<br /><br />&quot;Stop begging, it is not going to happen.&nbsp; Jolie is my best girl and I simply will not part with her.&nbsp; You do not understand the demand I have for her.&nbsp; If you take her you will cost me more than you could ever pay,&quot; Amanda replied coyingly her French accent grating on his nerves.<br /><br />&quot;Very well, m'lady.&nbsp; Send her to me tonight after I have had some time to rest,&quot; Gabriel snarled.<br /><br />Jolie knocked lightly on the door not daring to open it without permission.&nbsp; Amanda had gloated to her about her denial of Gabriel's request and Jolie knew he would be in a rage.&nbsp; When at last he beckoned her into his home she opened the door slowly gazing around at the room before her.&nbsp; No different from the millions of other rooms in world that she had stepped through, only this one held her greatest and darkest desire.&nbsp; Gabriel was the only vampire she had ever served and the feel of his fangs sinking into her tender flesh was unbelievably orgasmic.&nbsp; Never had she felt so full as when he gcutched her tightly against his body and drew her life's fluid from her veins while the blood from her back slicked along his chest and stomach, the muscles rippling against the slashes.<br /><br />She had barely made it far enough through the door to sit down the bag of spare clothes she always carried when that very door slammed shut behind her and Jolie was flung to the floor as white hot blinding pain sung through her nerves.&nbsp; A crack as loud as a shot and the whip fell again sending her mind soaring for the stars.Jolie lost count of how many times the whip fell, not yet breaking the skin.&nbsp; Amanda really had pissed him off now Jolie thought to herself in a moment of clearness before Gabriel picked her up from the floor shredding her clothes and throwing her on the couch. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Who do you belong to, slave?&quot; Gabriel spat at her, his fangs gleaming with saliva.<br /><br />&quot;I belong to you, Master,&quot; Jolie replied breathless, feeling his harsh glare and the wind rush just before his hand colided with her face.<br /><br />Taking up her hands, he dragged her to the room that served as his personal dungeon and strapped her to a St. Andrew's Cross.&nbsp; He watched as Jolie squirmed against the harsh wood beneath drinking in the sight and smell of her.&nbsp; With just the little time that had already passed she was already aroused and her arousal was dripping down her legs.&nbsp; Picking up a knife, he pressed himself against her pinning her to the wood and trailing the razor sharp point leaving a fine trail of blood down her ribs.&nbsp; He could feel the heat of her through pants that were growing ever tighter.<br /><br />&quot;Are you afraid of me, Jolie?&quot; he whispered and her answering whimper sent his libido soaring.<br /><br />Unfastening the bindings at her hands and feet he turned her around and again pressed against her.&nbsp; Gliding his empty hand down her flesh he slipped just one finger between her folds collecting just a few drops of her sweet nectar on the tip of his finger and setting it gently against his lips.&nbsp; Willing himself to resist he dropped his knees and buried his fangs in her thigh letting himself be engulfed in her taste and the scream he ripped from her throat before he closed his lips around her swollen clit.&nbsp; Gabriel teased her to a breaking point and pulled back over and over again before he shoved&nbsp;something large and metal into her.&nbsp; Pulling it out gently he slammed in back home as she screamed louder.&nbsp; Strapping the metal phallas into her, he stepped away to his rack of toys.&nbsp; Returning with an evil looking cat o' nine tails he began to gently flail her stomach increasing the power until the blood flowed gently down her&nbsp;white flesh.<br /><br />The sight of all that crimson blood against her whiteness drove beyond all reasoning.&nbsp; In his urgency to get her off the cross he broke the bindings.&nbsp; Throwing her on the bed, he again took the whip to her back trying to reign in his ever growing need to take her, to bury his painfully throbbing shaft in her tightly yielding heat.&nbsp; He could already imagine out it would feel, how amazing it would be to lose himself in her.&nbsp; Her whimpers pushed him further and further towards the edge until he uncovered the engorged flesh and leaned over her letting it pressagainst her ass. <br /><br />&quot;Do you want this, slave?&quot; he growled in her ear.&nbsp; She could only whimper incoherently.&nbsp; Jerking her hair cuelly he rasped, &quot;I can't hear you, slut!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Please, please, god yes, please.&nbsp; I've wanted it for so long,&quot; she begged him.<br /><br />Hearing the words forced his own control away from him and he thrust into the tightness of her anus and thrust into her sadistically.&nbsp; Digging his fingers into her hips, he pounded into her repeatedly with the metal shaft still strapped in her.&nbsp; On and on he went, willing himself not to climax until he had taken her fully.&nbsp; Jerking her head back to him, he sank his fangs into her shoulder letting the hot blood slide down his throat just as he was sliding in and out of her ass.&nbsp; Jerking back from her, he flung her over on her back with the blood still flowing from the wounds and undid the torture from her inside her and again wrapped his lips around the tender nub of flesh.&nbsp; This time he again assaulted her rear with the metal and when he had made her scream out in pain and ecstacy he strapped into place and dove into her already swollen sex sheathing himself brutally to the base in her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bending his head down, he gently flicked his tongue against her taught nipples marvelling at the hardness of them.&nbsp; When her hands came up to touch his hair, he forced them back down harshly and sucked harder.&nbsp; Withdrawing from her he gazed at Jolie's face as he again plunged into her and watched as a mixture of pain and pleasure warred on her features.&nbsp; Then he felt the muscles within her start to ripple and could feel her soaring toward her climax the pleasure driving her harder than he ever could.&nbsp; Harder and harder he plunged into that glorious heat and when her muscles tightened harshly around him her orgasm took him with her and his seed filled every space within her but still he kept pumping not wanting to lose her.<br /><div style=""text-align: center"">~*~*~*~</div><br />&quot;Jolie...&quot; he attempted to speak but could not find the words.<br /><br />&quot;Shhhh,&quot; she whispered next to him.&nbsp; &quot;Just enjoy it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This time,&nbsp;I submit to your will, beautiful Lady,&quot; he smiled as he rolled her on top of him and rested her head on his shoulder.<br /><br />Sometime in the day Jolie lost the last of her blood in a breathless gasp and what returned to Mistress Amanda the night of Jan&nbsp;1, 2010&nbsp; was not the same girl but a newly fledged vampre who only came to claim her belongings and pay, for in the New Orleans of 2009, vampires could not be employed in the adult fetish industry.&nbsp; Gabriel smiled tenderly as he drove her back to his home.<br /><br />&quot;Happy New Year, my love,&quot; he whispered and Jolie smiled, her new fangs glistening in the moonlight.&nbsp;<br /></lj-cut> <br /><hr /><br /><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">This has been my entry for the optional topic &quot;New Year&quot;

"event","Where did we come from? <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Not of this world""> <br />It was about 4:30 when I woke. I didn't have class that night and I was off work too, so I just let myself lie there and take in my surroundings. I was still at Simon's laying in his glorious bed. I could feel the weight of the bedspread pressing on me. The dream fading from my mind left me slightly uneasy, I'd had the same dream every morning for weeks. A woman and something strange, not a man but I wasn't sure what it was. I would almost say a demon but even that didn't feel right. The dream wasn't just those two though, there was always something evil there too, something different but familiar too. <br /><br />I could hear Simon moving around somewhere in the house. My mind returned to the present and I discovered that I didn't feel the least bit awkward. Even from this distance I could smell the honey and vanilla scent that had hit me the night before. I still liked it. Underneath that I could smell the deliciously copper scent of heated blood. My mouth suddenly felt like someone had packed it full of cotton. I groaned out loud. Before the sound had finished leaving my mouth Simon was beside the bed. In one hand he held a robe and the other held a large coffee cup full of the viscous, crimson liquid. I took the cup first, letting the blood slide down my throat and sooth the ache there. Finished the rest of the cup, I sighed contentedly and looked up at him. &quot;Hi.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Good evening, sleepy.&quot; The hint of laughter in his voice was just a littler heavier. He smiled at me as he held out the long, black robe that looked suspiciously like silk. <br /><br />I stood up and stretched muscles that complained only slightly. Simon leaned over and laid a gentle kiss on my shoulder where the evidence of the night before still lay for the world to see. Running one hand down my arm, he smiled and handed me the robe and left the room. The fabric slithered across my skin when I put it around me. Silk, definitely silk. I marveled again at the fact that I was perfectly comfortable with this man who I'd seen maybe two time before the night before. <br /><br />We talked again, but this time it was me with the questions, and I had a lot of them. Where had he come from? When had he come from? I'd never ask directly how old he was, but something about his manners said he was from a more civilized time where manners were more important. He answered all my questions eagerly, almost like he wanted me to know the answers as much as I wanted to know them. he told me stories of being a young boy in France under King Charles VII and then his son, Louis XI in 1461. I was enthralled by his tales of the war between the King and his brother Charles de Valois in 1472. It was on a night during Charles failed attempt to take Beauvais that he met Natalia, the vampire who had made him. She had been drawn by the fighting and had taken him when he was on a watch one night. So bloody and violent, it seemed wrong somehow to be listening to these stories in the dim pre-dusk light swathed in black silk. It all raised new questions in my mind. <br /><br />I was turned by Erick, Simon by Natalia. But who had turned them? How far back does the line go? There had to be a beginning somewhere, right? &quot;Simon, where do we come from? Vampires, I mean, as a people? Where does it all start?&quot; <br /><br />He smiled tenderly at me, &quot;I'll tell you but first, we have breakfast. This is a heavy topic to discuss on an empty stomach.&quot; I tried to argue but he wouldn't change his mind. He turned to the stove and started making eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, and of course more blood. He cooked too? How much more perfect could he be; there had to be something ugly in him somewhere. I had made it through two plates and four huge cups of blood before I finally felt full. Simon looked at me quietly for a moment as though he were weighing his thoughts about telling me against something I couldn't quite place. He took the hand that didn't have a cup in it and led me to the living room. He stood waiting for me to settle myself in the corner of the couch and then sat himself on the opposite end watching me. <br /><br />&quot;Gypsy, I'm old, technically, ancient. the story of the origins of <i>hominus vampyr</i> is older than Natalia and she was almost half a century old when she found me.&quot; He looked tired, worried, as though the weight of over 500 years were pressing down on him. &quot;I am honestly some what scared to tell you this, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Simon, just tell me. Remember I catch the bad little monsters, you're not going to scare me.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You know of angels and demons. There was one of them, Ragnarron, who fed upon the living.&quot; <br /><br />I began to see what Simon described. Not the stereotypical picture of a demon; horns, leathery wings, cloven hooves for feet, but instead a devastatingly handsome man. I could understand how he could lure victims to him. However, blood was not always enough to satisfy him. <br /><br />There was a woman in the village he hunted most often. She was the beautiful of all the women, married or not. Ragnarron wanted her for his own but she could not be lured away from her husband. One night, Ragnarron ran across the husband in the woods hunting and murdered him. Using his magic, he made himself look like the woman's husband and he lay with her that night in her marriage bed. The next morning the woman woke to find herself alone in the bed. She searched for her husband but could not find him. Before the sun set on that day, someone came to tell her that her husband's body had been found in the woods all but torn apart. She knew then that the man in her bed had not been her husband and she knew that she would soon find that she was with child. <br /><br />The woman left the village and moved up the mountain. She fasted and prayed for guidance but none came. In less time than was possible the child was born. Soon after though a second child arrived. A boy and a girl, though both were strange. Their eyes gazed on her with far too much presence behind them. Within weeks, they're otherness had increased, the children began to crave living blood. They were no longer able to leave the house during the day. Te woman saw the evil that was in her children and she feared for her life and the lives of the people in the village. <br /><br />One days, as they lay sleeping, the woman resolved that she would kill the two before they woke. She went outside and took the ax from the stump she used to chop wood for the the fire. She approached the sleeping bodies quietly and raised the ax above her head. As she made to swing it down upon her daughter, the girl child woke followed closely by her brother. They slaughtered the woman and then moved on to the villagers. <br /><br />&quot;And such was the birth of us,&quot; Simon finished. &quot;The first of us were twin siblings, half demon, half human. That is why we can still consume human foods but it takes blood to really sate us.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;What about the twins? What happened to them?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;The eventually were hunted down by other humans but not before they began our race and populated the world with vampires. Ragnarron tried to save him but the children were cast out of the ranks of demons. They were only half demon and were unaccepted by them. The humans feared them because there was so few things that would kill them.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;So we don't belong anywhere?&quot; I said softly. &quot;Not human, not demon, but something unwanted?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It seems so, but the vampires have the solace of having more of their kind. And, as we prove that we can live with people without slaughtering them, they slowly begin to accept us.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;But we will still be separate.&quot; I sighed. &quot;Always not really of the world we live in. <br /></lj-cut> <br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">This has been my entry for week 6 of </span><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><font size=""2""><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_therealljidol"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a id=""link_3"" href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><img class="" ContextualPopup"" alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" username=""therealljidol"" style=""border-right-width: 0px; padding-right: 1px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; border-left-width: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif?v=1"" /></span></a></span></font><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_therealljidol"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a id=""link_4"" href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><b>therealljidol</b></a></span>, the prompt was &quot;Not of this world&quot;.

"event","The night I turned Jackie over to the police had made me realize something about myself. I wanted to help people solve the mysteries in their lives. I couldn't be a cop, they didn't let vampires on the squads yet, so I did a little research and there was nothing saying I could be a private investigator. I started doing some&nbsp;digging into it and found that I would have to be licensed and that I wouldn't be able to carry a gun. Not that I was really worried about carrying; vampire, hello? The only concern was if any daytime work would be necessary. I did a little more digging and found a small niche of detectives that specialize in the things that go bump in the night. <br /><br />I started classes the next week. Part of the program was practical work. My teacher found&nbsp;me on the night shift with the agency he worked for. Thus began my career as Tampa's first vampire PI. I couldn't go out by myself until I got my license but I was sent out every night with the team, getting experience for when I did my first solo case. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Afterthought""> <br />I fell into my bed, exhausted. I was going to two classes a night and then from there going fo Polasky Investigations and working until about 3 in the morning. Just enough time for me to get back to the office, fill out my paperwork and then get home before dawn. I usually slept for a few hours and then got up and did my homework for class that night. I was asleep in record time that morning, just letting myself drift away on the tide of exhaustion into a blessedly dreamless sleep. <br /><br />Last night had been bad. There'd been a rash of murders in Lakeland that appeared to vampire attacks. The victim of choice was kids, no older than 13 or 14, some of them had been abused. The whole area was outraged and terrified at the same time. The police were stumped and not equipped to deal with the &quot;monsters&quot; anyway. Polasky had not just me on the payroll but also a werewolf and a banshee; so we got the call from the pd to help them find the bastard. We found him last night and it wasn't pretty. The fight to tag him had been epic. Apparently that vampire didn't respond so well to a banshee wail, Michaela was taken to the hospital with a concussion from getting thrown into a wall. Vince, our werewolf, got his arm broke, but being a werewolf he'd be healed by the next night so it was just splinted and he went home. I was battered, bruised, and sore as hell but the son of a bitch was behind reinforced silver coated titanium bars. <br /><br />My phone was ringing. Damn, I thought, looking at my alarm clock, three o'clock, I'd slept through my alarm, I'd never have time to do my homework now. &quot;Yeah,&quot; I snarled into the phone. <br /><br />&quot;Gypsy?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;This is she.&quot; The voice sounded familiar but I couldn't quite place it. &quot;Who's this?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I saw you on the news last night. You captured that creature that was attacking the kids.&quot; It was a man, voice soft but deep. A nice voice, I guess you could say a bedroom voice. <br /><br />&quot;Me and my team but yeah. If you have a case you should really call the office to set up a consult.&quot; I was trying to get off the phone, I needed to try to get some of my homework done. <br /><br />&quot;I don't want anything solved, I want to talk to you.&quot; <br /><br />That woke me up. &quot;Who is this?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You don't remember me? I think I'm slightly insulted.&quot; I heard it then, a hint of laughter in his voice. A jingle of cuffs against a bed railing, the coolness of water washing away burned skin, a bag of much appreciated blood. My EMT counselor, Simon. <br /><br />&quot;Simon? Sorry, I just woke up and I overslept,&quot; I said rubbing sleep from my eyes. &quot;So, you saw me on tv last night?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Well, not really on tv. I was with the team that took Michaela to the hospital. I never got a chance to check on you. You all looked pretty banged up.&quot; I thought I could remember seeing him there. <br /><br />&quot;It was a rough one. He was stronger than any of expected and his reaction to Michaela's wail was definitely different. Vince'll be ok by ton...&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Gypsy, I'm not worried about any of them. I called to check on you.&quot; <br /><br />Oh, a small flutter started in my belly. Why was he checking on me? &quot;I'm ok, nothing a few more hours of sleep won't cure but I have to go to class tonight.&quot; Though I was thinking about skipping, I highly doubt my teacher would blame&nbsp;me considering that he was healing a broken arm as I spoke. <br /><br />&quot;Why don't you play hooky?&quot; Was he reading my mind? &quot;I've been following the cases that you've been working on with Polasky and it seems like you could use a break. Let me take you to dinner.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Dinner?&quot; He was asking me to go to dinner with him? &quot;Wouldn't that be like a conflict of interests or something. Aren't you technically my counselor?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; he laughed, &quot; that's just for the first night when you wake up. I'm there to keep the&nbsp;babies from going crazy and slaughtering the city.&quot; <br /><br />Oh, that puts a whole different spin on things I thought. I did say there was a certain vampire I'd like to be friends with so why not? &quot;Well, then, I guess my answer is yes.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Good. I'll see you tonight around 6 then?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Sure. Bye, Simon.&quot; I hung up the phone laying back on my bed. I had a date with a vampire tonight. I called Vince and let him know that I wasn't going to make it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wasted&nbsp;my time&nbsp;calling, he was canceling class and Polasky was giving us the night off. Hmm, that just makes things too easy. <br /><br />I got up and went to my shower. A glorious thing with 3 heads spraying from different directions with a hell of a massage feature. I stood there letting the hot water beat the aches out of my muscles. A sharp sting on my left leg drew my attention to a scrape I hadn't seen before. Looks like a skirt was out of the question tonight. I got out and toweled my hair off and stood in front of my closet with the water cooling on my now milky skin. What to wear tonight? I chose a red shirt that hugged my curves and showed off the yumminess in front of me well. Pairing that with a pair of tight black jeans and knee high leather boots, I looked in the mirror. Make-up would be necessary, the red shirt&nbsp;made me look less creamy and more washed out. Make up on, hair brushed to an ebony gleam, my skin looked translucent and seemed to glow in the bathroom lights. I smiled and decided I was ready, just in time too. As I walked up to kiss my mom and let her know I was going out, someone knocked at the door. <br /><br />&quot;I've got it, Mom. It's for me!&quot; I pulled the door open in a rush and there he was. He looked different than the last couple times I'd seen him. Before he'd been all business but now he looked like something out of a dream, like he'd disappear if I touched him. Tonight he was wearing a loose sapphire blue shirt unbuttoned at the top, the blue of the shirt made his eyes stand out in his pale skin and it hugged his broad shoulders and arms seemingly barely able to hold the muscles in. I'd never noticed just how broad he was through the shoulders he was or how muscular he was. His copper hair lay loose against his shoulders blowing slightly in the breeze. The jeans were artfully faded in&nbsp;areas&nbsp;but they hugged all the pertinent parts nicely. This Simon was definitely different&nbsp; han the business like EMT or counselor and I have to admit, I liked it. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said smiling up at him. <br /><br />&quot;Hi.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Mom, I'm going out, I'll see you later. Love you!&quot; I said grabbing my purse fand stepping out the door closing it softly behind me. &quot;So where to?&quot; <br /><br />I'm glad I hadn't gotten too dressed up. He took me to a little vampire friendly place, they actually served blood with meals if you asked for it. Very forward thinking and the food was delicious. I'm a sucker for good Italian food and they made some of the best stuffed shells. They blood they served us was flavored with almonds and kept in a heated carafe so that it slid down my throat so smoothly, like a warm milk shake. <br /><br />We sat there talking for hours, Simon asked about my family, about everything he could think of. It was almost midnight when we left. I felt like I was floating, I'd never had this much fun with anyone before. I just felt so relaxed and at home with him. It just seemed so natural to lean back and close my eyes letting the memories flood me and then to tell them to Simon. He asked about the fire and how I had found who it was. Asked what had led me to start working for Polasky. <br /><br />We ended up back at his house which was surprisingly about two streets over from where I lived on Fern. He continued asking, the questions getting more pointed. He wanted to know about previous boyfriends, about things I had done with them. He stopped talking for a minute and just looked at me, like he was staring at my soul and then very slowly and tenderly, he kissed me. I was so surprised that I jumped back, I was starting to get nervous, the last time I did this, I died, I would really rather not repeat the experience. <br /><br />&quot;Gypsy, relax, I'm not going to hurt you.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I know that but the back of my mind still remembers what happened last time, you know. It didn't end so well.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />He &nbsp;didn't say anything he just reached out and stroked his fingers in a line from my chin to tmy cheek. So soft, so gentle. I closed my eyes and reveled in the sensation, like he was reaching through my skin and touching things that no hand should ever touch. I sighed and leaned my face into his hands. I felt more than heard him move in closer and his other hand was on my face and then he was running his fingers through my hair. I opened my eyes and stared into his beautiful gem colored eyes and it was like I was drowning in them. When he started to lean in to me, I lifted up some to meet his lips with my own and let myself fall into the kiss. His tongue touched tentatively at my lips, asking permission, begging for entrance and I gave it, moaning as I felt his tongue slide across mine. I could feel his hands in my hair, one of them moving down to wrap around my back and press me closer to him the other moving to cup the side of my face. He pulled back breathless and stared into my eyes. <br /><br />Simon started pulling me towards the back of the house slowly step by step reassuring me with his eyes and his hands on mine that he wasn't going to hurt me. He led me to an enormous bedroom equipped with shutters like the rest of the house that were already closed. He closed the door and pulled me to him, kissing me again, both hands on my face. He started kissing in a line across my jaw and down my neck leaving a trail of fire, my arms came up around him and held myself tighter to him. His fingers started up under the edge of my shirt trailing across my skin as he raised the shirt over my head and stared down at me. I could almost feel his eyes caressing my skin like a touch. We moved toward the bed where he laid me across the mattress gently climbing up next me and running his fingers down my stomach to the waist of my pants and back. My breath started coming faster with every pass of his fingers across the lacy bra I was wearing. <br /><br />&quot;I've wanted to get you alone like this since I met you in the hospital,&quot; he whispered against my ear. &quot;Gypsy, you are so beautiful.&quot; And then he was kissing me again. I couldn't believe what was happening. I had thought about this myself but never thought that it would actually happen. <br /><br />I felt the tug of my belt coming undone and then the buttons snapping. His finger trailed just below the waistband pushing the zipper down at the same time. I could hear moans coming out of my throat. It had been so long since anyone had touched me like this. I wasn't very experienced but I had experimented with one of my boyfriends and it had never been like this. Simon took his time, he wasn't in a rush. He had my pants unzipped and his hand reached in a cupped me through the lace panties I was wearing. I could feel him trembling slightly. I opened my eyes and the look in them must have told him that I wasn't going to say no because I could feel his fingers moving, circling over and around, exploring, finding all the right places, listening to my eager gasps. <br /><br />I reached for him pulling his shirt over his head, I wanted to see the muscles that the shirt promised. I wanted to run my hands over the smoothness of his chest and stomach. Without knowing when it happened I found my boots off and my jeans halfway down my hips and Simon staring up at me waiting for me to make him stop, when I didn't protest he pulled the pants further and then off, running his hands back up my legs to the lace around my hips and gently laid a kiss on my belly and tugged at them so he could kiss lower. I lifted my hips so he could pull them the rest of the way, then he was beside me again pulling me over to him so he could reach behind me and undo my bra and spill my breasts forward for him. He gently kissed each hardened nipple while his hand reached down to cup me&nbsp;and begin his little exploration again. <br /><br />I started tugging at his own jeans and he helped me get them down kicking them off at the end so that I could see there was nothing between the denim and his perfect white skin. My hand trailed down his stomach finding a trail of hair that wandered lower until it met with the coarseness surrounding him. I wrapped my hand around the shaft and reveled in the feel of him in my hand and his hand between my legs. Over and over we stroked each other until he pushed me back on the bed and crawled lower and looked up at me over my lower stomach. I lifted my hips to him as he bent down to lay a kiss gently against me and then flick his tongue across me slowly in long languorous strokes over and over again. I could feel the orgasm building in me, like a wave building out in the ocean and rushing to the shore to rise up and then break. Between on breath and the next I broke and the orgasm caught me and carried me away. Simon sucked at me drawing it out, his hands cupping my ass holding me to him as I rode the waves that kept breaking over me. Just when I thought I'd drown in pleasure, he pulled away from me, my body still quivering and kissed his way up to my breasts and took each one in turn. Flicking his tongue across them, bringing little moans from me. Finishing his journey up my body he ended with the head of him pressing against me holding me to the bed. <br /><br />&quot;Gypsy, are you sure?&quot; he asked nervously. &quot;I'll stop if you want.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Please, don't stop...&quot; I started and whatever else I was going to say was lost in his kiss. I felt the head of him split me and then he was pushing his way inside me. I was still spasming from the orgasm and the pressure of him pushing inside me, the thickness of him filling me brought smaller waves of ecstasy spilling out of me. He found the end of me and as I looked down my body I could watch him moving in and out of me finding his rhythm, finding that sweet spot and rubbing it over and over. I could feel the wave building, I knew he would bring me again soon. Staying firmly inside me, he shifted positions so that I was sitting on top of him with his back against the headboard and he guided my hips. I could feel him starting to lose that rhythm, straining to last until I had gone again. Just as it was about to break, I heard the little click of his fangs dropping and then I felt the press of them against my shoulder. <br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; I breathed. &quot;Please, do it.&quot; His fangs sunk home just as the orgasm broke over me and I screamed my pleasure to the world. My own fangs fell into place and I sunk them home in his neck. The feel of him inside me as he sped up spiraling himself towards his own climax and the taste of him sliding down my throat pushed me over the edge again and I didn't know if it was just one long orgasm or smaller ones coming too close together. Simon gave one last thrust and I could feel him spending himself in me, filling me up. His heart was hammering in his chest against me and I could feel my pulse trying to break free of my neck. He held me close while we both relearned how to breath and then he lay me back down on the bed and pulled away out of me making me writhe and spasm around him. <br /><br />&quot;Oh, god,&quot; he gasped collapsing on the bed next to me his fingers playing across my belly. I lay there my chest heaving staring at him, amazed. I had never imagined that it would be like this with him but he definitely knew how to take care of a girl. &quot;Gypsy?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Hmm?&quot; I couldn't have spoke then if I wanted to. <br /><br />&quot;Are you ok? Did I hurt you?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No, not hurt. Just not what I expected.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Better or worse?&quot; he asked shyly. <br /><br />&quot;Oh definitely better,&quot; I sighed my eyes starting to drift closed. <br /><br />&quot;Good.&quot; I could feel him pulling me into his chest and covering us under the luxurious blanket. He turned me over so that my head was laying on his shoulder and I laid one arm across his stomach and my right leg across his and breathed deeply of the scent of him. Honey and vanilla, I liked it. <br /><br />I could definitely get used to this. I liked the way his fingers were playing in my hair and the sound of his heart beating. I looked up at him and smiled to see him looking down at me too. Pinkish tracks glistening on his cheeks. I reached up to touch them, a question in my eyes. &quot;It's been a very long time since I've been with anyone and it just caught me off guard.&quot; I sighed against him and nestled&nbsp;into his&nbsp;shoulder&nbsp;and closed my eyes, a tiny contented smile on my face. <br /><br />&quot;I wonder if vampires can get pregnant,&quot; I asked out loud. I never heard his answer because I drifted off just a dawn broke across the sky. It was really just an afterthought, not something I was really worried about. <br /></lj-cut> <br /><hr /><br /><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">This has been my entry for week 5 of </span><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif?v=1"" /></span></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><span style=""font-size: xx-small""><b>therealljidol</b></span></a></span><span style=""font-size: xx-small"">, the prompt for this week was &quot;Afterthought&quot;.

"event","Another installment in Gypsy's life. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Trapped""> <br />I stood at my window that morning staring out at the yard. There was a slight lightening to the sky in the east, not enough for humans to see but enough to let me know it was almost bed time. I missed the colors of early morning, the way the grass looks when the sun first hits it with the little drops of dew scattered all around. Sighing, I closed the shutters that Mom had had installed on the inside of the windows and then the curtains. <br /><br />I went over to my bed and in a typical teenage move flopped down on it and lay there staring up at my ceiling. Why did I suddenly feel depressed? I loved my new stronger body and the fact that nothing on earth could really kill me. I liked the fact that most of the bullshit about vampires was just that. I didn&rsquo;t die at dawn, I actually slept. I could still eat regular food, I just had to have a healthy portion of blood in my daily diet. I just missed the colors of daylight. <br /><br />&ldquo;Gypsy?&rdquo; my mom said from the door. She&rsquo;d been worried about how I&rsquo;d been feeling. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, Mom. I&rsquo;m still awake. Come on in.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I just wanted to tell you good night, sweetheart.&rdquo; she said pushing my door open and looking at my window. <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s closed, Mom, I&rsquo;m not suicidal, just trying to adjust and get used to the fact that I&rsquo;ll never get to feel the sun on my face again.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, honey.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m kind of tired. Can we talk about this tonight?&rdquo; I said turning over and getting under the covers. I didn&rsquo;t want her to see the pinkish tears running down my face. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sure, baby.&rdquo; <br /><br />I lay there under my blanket thinking about the sun and let sleep wash over me. I dreamed I was laying on the beaches in Clearwater the clear sunlight kissing my skin and turning it a beautiful bronze color. My brother was sitting next me complaining about skin cancer and sunburns. He always burned. Then the dream changed, I was in the backyard with the whole family and my best friend Jackie. Daddy was building a bonfire, I watched as the flames licked up the little teepee of wood he had made and I could smell the smoke coming from behind me. Behind me? That&rsquo;s not right. I turned around quickly and the house was being engulfed in flames just like the wood pile. Our home was on fire. I sat up wide awake in my bed. <br /><br />I jumped up and ran to my door and threw it open. I started out it towards Mama&rsquo;s room but a searing pain in my left arm stopped me. The window above the stairs had always let in just the right amount of sunlight. Now it was a death trap for me. <br /><br />&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; I screamed. &ldquo;Mom, wake up! The house is on fire.&rdquo; I could smell the smoke coming from downstairs in the living room but there was a clear path to the kitchen she could get out. She came out of her room, still sleep fogged. &ldquo;Go through the kitchen, it&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; she asked stalling at the top. <br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me!&rdquo; I screamed. &ldquo;Just go!&rdquo; She went. <br /><br />I looked at the light coming from the ceiling light, it was only 10 am I&rsquo;d never be able to wait it out. I prayed one of our neighbors would call 911. Can a vampire still pray? I wasn&rsquo;t sure, crosses and such didn&rsquo;t really like us much. My prayers were answered, I heard the sirens coming. <br /><br />The fire was under me and two room over. Two room full of extremely flammable memories; I had about 10 minutes before it would reach me. Fire not so much a problem, I could heal all the damage from that. The problem was the sunlight. How to get out of the house and survive. I could the firefighters now coming up the stairs calling me. <br /><br />&ldquo;Here I called, I&rsquo;m in here!&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Can you come out of the room at all?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s a shaft of light right outside my door. I&rsquo;m trapped.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Stand back from the door, we&rsquo;re coming in.&rdquo; <br /><br />I stood back from the door, away from the sunlight. They came through carrying a box shaped kind of like a coffin. This must be how they&rsquo;re planning on getting me out of here, I thought, in a freaking box. You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me I thought as I climbed in and they locked it down over me. The box swayed sickeningly as they carried me down the stairs. I could feel the heat from the fire as they made their way out of the house. <br /><br />We were taken to the hospital to be treated for any injuries. I was of course taken below to the vampire ward and let out of the damnable box finally. Sitting in the hospital bed fuming I was finally told that it had been arson. Someone in our neighborhood had set our house on fire. I was pissed. I wanted to know who but no one could tell me. <br /><br />After dark I got Mom settled into a hotel and went back to find out who had set my home on fire. I walked up the driveway I had played in as a child and stared at the ruin of all my memories. I could feel the anger boiling up, turning me into a living torch, burning me in a way that was distinctly comforting. I would find this person and I would deal with them. <br /><br />I started by the front corner of the living room, where they said the fire was started. I caught the scent of gasoline easily but underneath of that I could smell something else, fear. Whoever had done this had been terrified. I touched the ground out from where the gas had been poured. I rubbed it between my fingers and then touched my fingers too my nose, the smell hit me quickly. Jackie. My best friend had poured gasoline on my house and set it on fire. I could understand her being afraid to be around me but trying to kill me and my mother. That was another thing all together. <br /><br />I straightened out of the crouch I was in and turned. Jackie&rsquo;s house was only a few houses down from ours. It was extremely helpful when it came to sleep overs and study dates. And now it would be even more helpful in tracking her down. I walked down the sidewalk slowly, blending in the shadows of the trees over hanging it. I stopped just before I got to her driveway and stared. Her light was on and I knew that there was another window on the back of the house that I could get into more easily. <br /><br />I climbed the lattice on the side of the house with a practiced ease and slipped in the window. Oh yeah, didn&rsquo;t I tell you, that myth about a vampire having to be invited in is bs too. I landed on the top of the toilet in her private bathroom. Silently I stood up and moved into her room. Jackie was still downstairs with her family getting ready for bed. I looked at the clock on her desk, 8 pm, I had a couple of hours to wait. I looked around and found her diary. Of course I read it, quit looking so surprised. The entries over the last couple of week got progressively nastier about me and I realized that the attack that had turned me had broken her. That hurt, bad. <br /><br />I heard Jackie coming up the stairs and quickly put everything back the way it was and sat down on her bed. I watched her as she came in the room and went to her desk. A quick update of Facebook and LJ, a look into her email and then she turned around. I was on her before she could scream. One hand covering her mouth, the other around her throat. <br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very naughty lately, Jackie-girl&rdquo; I whispered in her ear using the childhood nickname. &ldquo;You did something very bad to me and my mom, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; <br /><br />She bit down on my hand hard but I didn&rsquo;t feel anything. Again, I could feel the strength coursing through my muscles and knew I could easily break her neck if I really wanted too. In the same instant, I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. I wasn&rsquo;t a murderer, a monster. <br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out the window, Jackie. I&rsquo;m going to take you to the police station and you&rsquo;re going to tell them what you did or I&lsquo;m going to do the same to your house.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Screw you, Gypsy. She shouldn&rsquo;t have let a tainted monster like you back in her house. She was asking for it,&rdquo; Jackie spit in my face when I moved my hand from her mouth. Reflexively I tightened the hand on her throat cutting of her diatribe before she could get started. <br /><br />Before she could say or do anything, I reached in the drawer grabbed her diary and her and was out the window. I ran all the way to the station, never stopping, never slowing. I walked through the doors with Jackie walking sedately by my side, my fingers holding the back of her neck. <br /><br />&ldquo;I have information about the fire last night on Mason St.&rdquo; I said to the desk clerk. She paged the detective working on the case and he came down right away. <br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about, Miss Love?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; I gave Jackie I shake and handed him her diary. <br /><br />She told him what she had done. I think she believed me when I told her that I&rsquo;d burn her house down. Jackie went to jail that night but she&rsquo;ll be going somewhere a little less jail-esque and a little more psycho wardy. She really lost her mind when I became a vampire. <br /><br />The insurance settlement on the house is going to buy us another one in a more vampire friendly neighborhood. It has an apartment in the basement that&rsquo;s been set up perfectly for a vampire. There&rsquo;s even a heat lamp type thing to help me get used to not being in the sunlight by giving me the heat and the light without the damaging effects of the UV rays. I like the apartment, gives me some more privacy and the feel of having my own place but keeps me close enough to Mom to keep her happy. <br /></lj-cut> <br /><hr /><span style=""font-size: smaller"">This has been my entry of the week 3 prompt of &quot;It's A Trap!&quot; in&nbsp;<lj comm=""therealljidol""/>&nbsp;.&nbsp; Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.&nbsp; I will be posting a link to voting as soon as it's up.&nbsp; Your continued support is greatly appreciated.</span>"

"event","18 year old Gypsy Love meets Erick at the bar she works at. What she thought was going to be a great one night stand quickly turns into something else all together. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Here there be dragons""> <br />My grandfather used to collect maps, old maps. He had one that was his favorite; it had belonged to a pirate, on the edges past the charted areas was written &ldquo;Here be dragons&rdquo; in a beautiful flowing handwriting. I used to beg him to tell me stories of the dragons that warning told of and he told the most wonderful stories, tales of piracy and romance that I just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of. <br /><br />That was before I knew that the monsters of every little kids nightmare was real. Back before the vampires showed themselves to the world. Now everything is different. Oh, how I wish I was still that little girl. <br /><br />My name is Gypsy Love and I&rsquo;m dead. Well, not technically dead per say, it would be more accurate to say undead since I&rsquo;m a vampire now. It hasn&rsquo;t always been this way, I was a lively living girl just a few months ago. That was before Erick came into my bar. Erick, now there&rsquo;s a man to turn a girl&rsquo;s head; tall, lean, handsome, pale. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hi, can I get you a drink?&rdquo; I said bouncing up next to him. I was a waitress in a little hole in the wall bar. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said, his voice like dark velvet. &ldquo;How about a coke?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Not a problem. I&rsquo;ll be right back with it.&rdquo; I walked away through the crowd that was already gathering. It was early on a Friday night so I knew it would only get worse. <br /><br />Making my way back over to him I had plenty of time to admire the view. Good genetics I thought, nice strong jaw line, very masculine. His eyes were wide and a little deep set, the color of new leaves in the spring. I was betting he was close to six feet tall; lean, hard muscle covered every inch of his body as far as I could tell. I was almost drooling by the time I got to his side. <br /><br />&ldquo;Here you go, darlin,&rdquo; I said, smiling and flipping my pony tail back over my shoulder. <br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked softly. <br /><br />&ldquo;Gypsy,&rdquo; I answered him. &ldquo;My mom was a hippy.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Gypsy,&rdquo; he rolled my name around on his tongue making something low in my belly tighten. &ldquo;When do you get off?&rdquo; He hung around doing nothing the whole night but watching me until the bar closed and then he waited for me outside. If you had told me what would be waiting for me outside, I don&rsquo;t think it would have changed anything. <br /><br />When I walked up to him he slid an arm around my back pulling me in tight against his chest. He crushed his lips against mine and I didn&rsquo;t fight him. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing but I didn&rsquo;t want to stop either. I melted against him and wrapped my arms around his neck. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Erick,&rdquo; he said when he pulled back from me smiling. Sighing I leaned forward pressing my breasts harder against him and ran my fingers through his soft hair and then down in a line from his neck to the waistband of his jeans. He smelled so good. <br /><br />Erick stepped around me pulling me back toward the side of the building. Once around the corner he pressed me between himself and the bricks. I could feel him, hard and excited through my skirt and I wanted him. He gave me what I wanted, what I was all but begging for, in a fast rush. Then things started to change, he was being too rough. I tried to push away from the wall but he was too strong for me, stronger than anyone I had ever seen. I felt the sharp nip of his fangs against my neck and I realized exactly how much trouble I was in. <br /><br />I gathered my breath to scream and just before I could he struck like a fist slamming into my neck. The pain was so intense I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I closed my eyes and could feel my life draining away from me one suck at a time. It continued for longer than I could have imagined before he backed away and turned me around. When I opened my eyes, he was standing in front of me, my blood covering his face and his own wrist bleeding. I tried to fight him off again but I was too weak. <br /><br />The will to live took over and I drank what he offered. His blood slid down my throat thickly coating everything inside me. My stomach cramped trying to reject the unnatural liquid filling it and slowly my body began to change. I thought the pain of his bite was bad but it was nothing compared to this. It felt like I was on fire. The last thing I saw was him laughing as he walked away and then I passed out. <br /><br />The next thing I knew I was lying on a gurney with handcuffs locking my wrists to the guard rails. I pulled against them and felt the metal of the rails give just the slightest. That wasn&rsquo;t right, I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to bend metal. A sound by the door drew my attention and I looked to find a strange man standing in the doorway of what could only be the vampire ward of Tampa General Hospital. <br /><br />&ldquo;Who are you? Why am I in the vault?&rdquo; I said feeling my throat tighten around the words, it hurt so badly and I felt like I hadn&rsquo;t had a drop of water in days. <br /><br />&ldquo;To answer your second question. You&rsquo;re here because you were attacked by a rogue vampire and changed. We had to put you in here until you could get control of yourself,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;As for the first, I&rsquo;m Simon. I guess you could call me a counselor of sorts. I&rsquo;m here to help newborns when they first wake up.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Wait, what do you mean, I was changed. I&rsquo;m a fucking vampire now?&rdquo; I screamed pulling harder on the restraints. &ldquo;Let me out of here, I need to go home!&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Of course but please calm down before you hurt yourself. You&rsquo;ve just woken up so you&rsquo;re still somewhat weak,&rdquo; Simon pleaded with me. &ldquo;Gypsy, please, you&rsquo;re family has been informed and they&rsquo;re waiting for you at home. Your car is in the parking lot, I&rsquo;ll take you to it but first you must calm yourself.&rdquo; <br /><br />I stopped fighting when he came over to unlock the cuffs. Afterward, I just lay there for a few moments staring at the ceiling. &ldquo;How could a one night stand have ended so badly? My mother is never going to let me hear the end of this,&rdquo; I sighed. <br /><br />I went home and got the expected lecture from my mother. I was called the next evening by a very nice detective who informed me that it wasn&rsquo;t just a rogue vampire but a serial killer. He was caught the night after he attacked me. Apparently I had been a slightly raving lunatic for a few nights while the insanity that he held worked its way through my body and mind and everything settled inside me. It has been a very nasty scene that ended with Erick as a real and truly dead corpse. <br /><br />Now, I&rsquo;m a vampire. It&rsquo;s a slightly heady thing being vulnerable only to sunlight and holy items. It did put a slight dampener on my social life, it seems my friends don&rsquo;t exactly trust me not to kill them. Don&rsquo;t really know that I blame them, they suddenly smell way too good; if you know what I mean. I lost my job when I threw a customer through the window for grabbing my ass, guess my boss didn&rsquo;t like it when I did that. So hear I am, trying to get used to the extra strength, better hearing, better sense of smell, and just generally everything; I&rsquo;m having to completely relearn everything and rethink my whole life. <br /><br />I guess I&rsquo;m going to go explore those uncharted areas of the map after all. I wonder if that old pirate was right and there really are dragons beyond those borders. <br /></lj-cut> <br /><hr /><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller"">This has been an entry for </span><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_"" lj:user=""therealljidol"" style=""white-space: nowrap""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><span style=""font-size: smaller""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif?v=1"" /></span></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><span style=""font-size: smaller""><b>therealljidol</b></span></a></span><span style=""font-size: smaller"">.

"event","So, here it is, time for Lj Idol over at <lj comm=""therealljidol"">.  This is my 3rd time getting on this horse after falling of and failing miserably so some of you already know who I am and some of you don't, for a quick refresher you can go look at see just <a href=""http://angelic-mystic.livejournal.com/252829.html""
alt=""submission"">who this crazy person really is</a>.  There are some things that are different now than they were then.  For one, I'm 26 (almost 27 but don't tell anyone), my daughter is almost 5, and my step daughter is 8.  I should tell you what to expect this year 'cause it's going to be a little different.  I'm going to be doing pretty much nothing but fiction.  Honestly, my life is too boring now to be able to use it for most of the prompts and if I try using the past it's just going to be too depressing.

So enough about me, lets talk about the people you'll be meeting this year.  Each of my entries will center around one of two ladies that I've been getting acquainted with recently.  They've both been flitting in and out of my imagination for about a year now and they are very interesting women.

Jolie LaVeau is - for the most part - a typical 20 something woman living in New Orleans in the early 21st century.  Typical until you look at her lineage; she is a direct descendant of Marie LaVeau, the voodoo queen of New Orleans.  She had a hard time of it as a kid.  Jolie's father walked out before she was born and he mother died when she was just 9 years old.  Raised by a cruel and abusive aunt, Jolie ran away from her home in Baton Rouge.  She didn't stop running until she found herself in the French Quarter of New Orleans.  I'm not going to say too much more about Jolie though, I'll let her tell her own story.

Gypsy Love is a fledgling vampire left on her own to learn how to be a vampire and try to reconcile her old life and this new one.  At the age of 18, Gypsy met a man that would be the end of life as she knew it, literally.  Murdered by a serial killer who turns all his victims into vampires, Gypsy must come to terms with her new found thirst for blood.  Listen while she tells you how she became more than anyone could ever believe.

Hopefully you'll get to see many of these ladies' adventures this season.

I haven't been the easiest person to deal with over the last few years and yet I've had many people stand beside me through it all.  My real friends and family, the ones that really do love me and care about what happens to me.

That is what I feel I have to give thanks for this year and always.  My mom who no matter what I've done has always come through when I need her help, no matter how angry she was at me.  She taught me how to be strong and how to survive even the worst life can throw at you.

My best friend Lisa, my god I don't know what I would have done without her to give me a place to hide.  I love you, sis!

My wonderful husband, Tom!  My saving grace so many times.  You've given up so much to make me happy.

All the friends that I can't name, thank you for just being you and for being what I needed so many times."

"event","The day was May something... the year 2001, I was a junior in high school. My home and burned down and I was now wrapped safely in my boyfriend's arms. 
<div style=""text-align: center""><i>
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Images
</i></div>
I felt rough hair and soft warm breath against my ear as he whispered, &quot;I love you.&quot; God my heart soared. I had known almost from the beginning that I would love him but I wasn't sure. I was only 17 after all. It was all over then, the waiting, the worrying; he had said it! My down home southern country boy had said that he loved me. I was... I can't even begin to eexplain it. 

<div style=""text-align: center""><i>You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick</i></div>

Months went by and things were amazing. Except for one blaringly horrid month. Once again, I was only 17, completely ruled by my hormones. He was only 21, completely ruled by his hormones. Well, I'm pretty sure you can guess where that's going... we got caught. Things were horrible and I was so lost. We ended up working things out and getting back on track. All the while with him telling me that he loved me and would always be mine. 

<div style=""text-align: center""><i>We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
Images
</i></div>

I graduated from high school May 31, 2002 and he was there in the crowd with my father cheering me on. LIfe with JR Ramsey was great! Or at least I thought it was. I moved out on my own and he spent many night sleeping next to me, holding me through my dreams. I had no idea that in just a few months my child's heart would soon get a taste of real pain. In October of 2002, after just over a year and a half, JR told me that he didn't want to be mine anymore. 

<i><div style=""text-align: center"">Did I make it that easy
To walk right in and out of my life?
 </div></i>

He lied to me. I believed he would always be mine. I knew I would marry him and have a large family, but he lied. He changed his mind and left me sitting on my bed alone after kissing me good-bye for the last time. He told me then that he would never be able to forget me, but I saw him only a month later with a new girl in what was our spot and he looked quite happy and oblivious to the heart he had destroyed. I thought he destroyed me, but he didn't it. I destroyed myself. I let his false witness into my soul and it hurt when it came back out. 

<i><div style=""text-align: center"">So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you</div></i>

It took me a few years but I realized my own mistake. I had to fall even further than I had at that point but I found REAL love in the end. So long, my luckless romance, my back is turned on you. You were never real, you were just a dream and now I'm awake to bear to true witness to the power of love over all.

"event","&quot;Mommy, no!&quot; a tiny voice screams at me in the middle of my tirade and I stop dead in my tracks. My almost 4 year old daughter scolds me without knowing it for not controling myself better. <br /><br /><i>I am that misfire in your brain</i> <br /><br />I am an almost 26 year old bi-polar woman. I make excuses for myself; I use my chemical imbalance as a crutch to explain away my constant instability. I try and try to control myself, but I always seem to slip at some point. <br /><br /><i>That makes you feel out of control</i> <br /><br />I have to force myself to leave my bedroom, let alone my home. I'm really quite terrified of what is outside my door. It seems that I can't go one day without fighting with my parents. Something always ends up happening that pisses someone off. When it happens I can never seem to control my tongue. I've never had an inner monologue button or a filter between brain and mouth but I used to be able to stop stuff on the tip of my tongue before it spills out. Not any more. <br /><br /><i>I am that chemical inside your head</i> <br /><br />What is this chemical in my head? What is it that won't let me be sane again? <br /><br /><i>That refuses to let you go</i> <br /><br />Whatever it is, it won't let me go. It has me in grip as hard as steel and I can't see a way out. <br /><br /><i>I am Bi Polar</i> <br /><br />I am bi polar. I fight an uphill battle both coming and going on a daily basis. I hardly ever sleep but I'm always tired. I lay awake at night listening to my brain tell my little lies to break me down. I drag myself through the days arguing with my brain, fighting against the lies. Fighting to breathe, fighting to live, fighting to one day be free. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller"">This post is for </span><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><span style=""font-size: smaller""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" /></span></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><span style=""font-size: smaller""><b>therealljidol</b></span></a></div><span style=""font-size: smaller"">&quot;Up Hill, Both Ways, Barefoot&quot;, thank you for reading.

""><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;I can't do this right now!&rdquo; I screamed at him. &ldquo;I have a test Monday that I have to study for.&rdquo; With that I turned and went down stairs to the computer room that doubled as my study. Mama and Daddy were both out, Mama at the hospital working and Daddy on the road driving. I was alone with him, the man I married, the man who was going to kill me.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">My husband, Richard wasn't the greatest choice I could make. Actually he was the worst. I married him because I was stupid and young. We'd been married for four years by now and all of those four years had been full of pain and heartache. Miscarriages, still births and one child that died at only a year old, I hadn't really gotten over that but I was forcing myself to move on. I was in school, trying to follow in my mother's footsteps and be a wonderful nurse.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">The operative word there being trying, it wasn't going so well. The abuse Richard put me through was taking quite a toll on me and my school work. I found it difficult to concentrate on my studies with broken ribs and quite a trial to write with my right wrist broken and in a cast.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I was thoroughly absorbed in my anatomy book when an arm slid around my throat and cut off the air that I needed to live. I scratched and clawed at the arm and I could feel my long nails tearing through the skin on his arm. I tried to scream around the pressure on my larynx but it barely came out as a whisper. The world started to get a black haze over it and I knew if I let the world go completely black I would never see it again. I fought harder, reaching up behind me I raked my nails across his eyes and welcomed the pained growl I heard come from him.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">The python like arm loosened enough for me to get away and threw my chair back into his chest knocking the wind from him. I ran. Did I run out the door you ask. No, I didn't. I ran for the closest weapon I could find, my mother's favorite kitchen knife. What? Why didn't I run out the door like a smarter woman would? I never said I was smart; actually, I knew that if he didn't die that night, I would at some point. So I was going to finish it myself and put him out of my misery permanently. Hey, again, I never said I was smart.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I was in the kitchen before he ever regained his breath and came for me. I had the knife in my hand, sharp, so sharp. I hid in the corner waiting for him. I saw Richard's shadow as he came toward the door way. I waited til he was all the way in the room and past me before I struck out with the knife and slashed across his back. I screamed my fear and rage at him but it was only a whisper, my larynx was bruised. I fought him for my life and my freedom. I knew how to use a knife to defend myself. I made several nice cuts on his body but he was still stronger and faster than me.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">He rushed me. He caught me off guard and got inside my reach and threw me against the counter. The world sparkled and danced in front of my eyes. Before I knew what was happening he had the knife away from me. My only defense against him was now betraying me. Still I fought him, fought with all I had in me but it just wasn't enough.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">In one of those moments where it seems like you have all the time in the world he back handed me hard across my right eye and I was down. I saw it coming, I saw the flurry of kicks he rained down on me. I could appreciate the way his muscled moved and bunched as he buried his foot over and over in my stomach.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;Please... no more...&rdquo; I choked out.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;What, bitch?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;I'm sorry. I shouldn't have screamed at you, I'm sorry.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;I just bet you are, cunt. I'm going to make you remember who the boss is this time.&rdquo; And he kicked me in the face. I could hear my nose shatter at the same time my left cheek did. I knew it was almost over. I was going to die right there in my mother's kitchen.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; Richard screamed pulling me to my knees by my hair, hair that was already tangled with blood and tears, and pulled my head back. I cried. I'm not ashamed of it, I did.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said in a dead empty voice as he put the cold steel blade against the soft flesh of my throat. He pressed the blade harder and stopped for just a second before sliding in an arc around my throat.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">This was it, I could feel the scalding heat of the blood flowing down my chest. He dropped me and the knife then turned away. I lay on the floor drowning and bleeding to death watching him. I knew he had only cut one blood vessel so it would take a couple minutes for me to bleed out. I knew there was nothing I could do but I still lifted my hand to my neck and tried to stop the bleeding. Then he turned back to me and picked up the knife again and buried it to the handle in my heart.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I stood there looking at my body in disbelief. I'm dead I thought sadly but he was speaking to my body, &ldquo;This is your fault, you know, if you had just listened.&rdquo; That bastard had just murdered me and was blaming me? I screamed at him, I beat my fists against his back but he didn't even notice. He just kept right on talking to my body, &ldquo;Oh, Jessica, I love you but look what you made me do, you had to be taught a lesson that you wouldn't be able to forget.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I heard a sound behind me and turned to see my mother standing the doorway with her gun pulled and the paramedics behind her. Without saying a word she pulled the trigger and ran to my body. The paramedics did what they do best and tried to save me. All of them kneeling in my blood, ignoring my husband who couldn't be helped. Mama don't miss when she aims her gun, and she aimed right between his eyes.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I guess it was all just a worthless and empty gesture for him to try to kill me, cause here I am.&nbsp; Oh I died that night for all of ten minutes but I didn't stay dead.&nbsp; Guess it sucks to be him though cause he sure didn't wake back up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><br />"

"event","So, here it is another year, another season of LJ Idol. Let's hope I can do better this season than I did last season. <br /><br />Well, to start at the beginning, I'm Nessa. The loyal, compassionate, forgiving, loving psycho is back in the game. Don't worry though, I don't bite unless you ask REALLY nicely. <br /><br />When last I introduced myself, I was living in Virginia Beach, VA and I was 24. I am now 25 and living in Lakeland, FL with that beautiful daughter that I spoke last year. I love my VERY dysfunctional family even though they drive me even crazier than they did before; admittedly most of the time things ARE my fault. I'm not perfect, oh well, I'm only human and crazy on top of that. <br /><br />I'm learning to let the world see the real me... slowly. It's a difficult thing to do after hiding for so long. <br /><br />I still have the same temper I did. Still quite a bit of a putz at times... most of the time lately. <br /><br />So, here it is. Introducing the great and all powerful Nessa~Mommy. Love me or hate me, it's your choice but at least get to know me first. <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller"">This post is for <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/profile""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/therealljidol/""><b>therealljidol</b></a>.</div></span>"

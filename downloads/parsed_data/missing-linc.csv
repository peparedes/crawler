"event","America, at a political level, lives in fear of human rights, of limiting it's own ability to act in violation of not only legal human rights requirements, but basic moral actions.

In my previous LJ (<lj user=""notsowise_sage"">), I wrote about America's fight against the ICC, a ground breaking attempt at making no one exempt from the law, and giving anyone accused the right to an impartial judicial system whether they're Saddam Hussain,  Adolf Hitler, George Bush, or Osama Bin Laden.

If a complaint is heard and upheld, (the complaint may be politically based, but the rules of the ICC mean that in itself it can not act for political reasons), then action will be taken to bring the defendant to the court, whether or not they're a head of state, head of a business, or any other organisation. They only prosecute in violation of human rights (at the most major levels, such as genocide), and it's mandate excludes any crime that took place before the ICC's formation, but all Human Right violations committed by anyone who is seemingly above the law based on their position within a country after it's formation is included.

Currently 100 countries have signed up, but America is forcing most of them to sign a document that excludes American citizens from being acted against, at the threat of financial or military support being withdrawn.

The following is an article from a new service in Kenya called Daily Nation (http://www.nationmedia.com):

Why Kenya Should Not Bend to US Pressure
Daily Nation, Kenya
June 27, 2005 Opinion
Mary Okioma
www.nationmedia.com 
 <hr>
The horror of crimes against humanity should end when the last victim takes the last breath, but it does not. Throughout history, the killing fields of the world have had something in common that is perhaps more horrifying than the killings- most of the perpetrators have gone unpunished!

The desire to bring perpetrators of crime against humanity to justice led to the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998. Like the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda before it, the ICC embodies the principle that no one is above the law and no one will escape punishment for horrendous crime. The ICC's mission is to handle the most serious cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, where national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.

Kenya's ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC a few weeks ago gave the international community at least three reasons to celebrate. First, the number of signatories to the Rome Statute edged closer to the 100th mark. Secondly, this was another statement that the ICC, arguably the most important recent development in international criminal justice, had been embraced by the international community and most importantly, Kenya's signature entrenched the ICC deeper in international criminal justice thus hastening the end of impunity for crimes against humanity.

While the international community was celebrating the news that Kenya had finally ratified the Rome Statute, the Bush administration was working overtime to see how best to undermine Kenya's ratification with the aim of clipping the power of the ICC all together. Kenya is now under intense pressure from the Bush administration to sign a Bilateral Non Surrender Agreement (BIA) also known as an Article 98 agreement.

By signing the BIA, Kenya would be bound to provide immunity to American citizens and personnel (including foreign sub-contractors working for the United States) for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Kenya would also have to refrain from assisting other parties in their efforts to send American citizens to the ICC. The pressure on Kenya carries serious financial implications - at least Sh1.2 billion in form of military support now hangs in the balance.

The Bush administration's efforts to undermine the ICC are not new on the international scene. In 2001, the Senate passed the American Service Members Protection Act, requiring that military assistance be suspended to all state parties to the ICC unless they have signed a BIA with the United States or obtained a waiver. In the following year, America withdrew it's signature to the Rome Statute of the ICC and has since made at least 60 countries sign BIAs or face withdrawal of military aid. America's targets are either small countries, or fragile democracies with weak economies.

Countries which have refused to enter into such agreements, have often had their military assistance withdrawn and so far, about 35 countries have suffered America's wrath.

America's reason for frustrating the ICC is that the tribunal may be used for politically motivated prosecutions of current and former US officials, soldiers or other Americans. However, the purpose for which the ICC was set up and the rules that guide it's operations reveals that the Bush administration's spirited war against it is unwarranted for two reasons: first, the ICC's jurisdiction is complementary to national sovereignties and will only intervene when states are unwilling or unable to prosecute crimes against humanity.

While it cannot be denied that some of the complaints to the ICC may be politically motivated, the ICC's rules make it impossible for the court to act politically. It would be short-sighted and unfair to judge the ICC by the complaints it receives but by what it does with those complaints. This argument arises from the thinking that in cases of ethnic conflict, the guarantee that at least some perpetrators of war crimes or genocide may be brought to justice acts as a deterrent and enhances the possibility of bringing conflict to an end.

In theory, the American government has been a 'passionate defender of human rights' for as long as America has existed. On the basis of her perceived passion for human rights, America has taken it upon herself to speak against other countries for their 'wanting' standards in human rights and has occasionally, for instance in the case of Iraq, initiated war crimes prosecutions against other countries' leaders. However, if America was as keen about human rights as she appears to be, she would support the ICC for any one or more of the following reasons:

- For the first time in history, we have a court with universal jurisdiction that can punish individuals who commit crimes against humanity. Such crimes have gone unpunished in the past.

- Unlike ad hoc tribunals which are subject to geographical and time limits, the only crimes the ICC cannot handle are those committed before it came into existence.

- The ICC can prosecute masterminds of crime against humanity who may be holding senior positions in government or military and who may be beyond reach of national courts.

- The ICC serves as a warning to potential war lords and like minded individuals that crimes against humanity will not go unpunished.

The unwavering crusade against the ICC is not the only move the United States has made against justice and human rights. One of the clear indicators of America's disregard for human rights emerged at the birth of the League of Nations in 1919. The American Senate would not let President Woodrow Wilson sign the charter and America did not join the League of Nations for the entire time that it was in existence.

America's stand on international human rights issues has not changed over the years and to date, it refuses to recognise the Inter - American Court of Human Rights to which most other governments from the Americas are accountable for human rights violations. America has also refused to ratify major human rights treaties and conventions such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against women. The genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia had as many casualties as they did due to America's policy of acting deaf and dumb in the face of massive human rights violations. No wonder the conclusion by many that America supports human rights only when it is politically expedient to do so.

When parliamentarians meet to discuss the motion on whether or not the government should bow to US pressure to sign a non-surrender agreement, a delicate balance must be maintained between the desire to defend Kenya's sovereignty as well as uphold human rights and the benefits that Kenya could lose should the government not sign.

Our parliamentarians do not have much choice in this matter. Kenya must stand up against double standards in international justice even at the cost of offending the Bush administration. We must uphold human rights for victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. If Kenyans made any other decision, we would be saying to the Adolf Hitlers, Pol Pots and Iddi Amins of this world that they can kill innocent men women and children with impunity and get away with it. In defence of our sovereignty as a nation and in the interest of human rights and justice, Kenya must stand her ground and refuse to sign the BIA even at the cost of losing America's 'aid'.

"event","The battle against Xianderthal was won a while back, Psychedelic-Scotti put the finishing touches to them with his mega-boot kick. However it seems to be a breed of bad guy, there's another a bit like Xianderthal, not nearly as offensive, more overly defensive, sniping at anyone they thinks attacking them.

It will have to be clever tactics getting around them, however if they keep attacking people might have to deal with them. There's something about Xianderthal's type that seems to encourage this sort of behaviour, yet their close cousins like Micky-Iron don't have the same problem. It's strange, I can see myself joining forces with Micky-Iron to deal with Stoning-Sam soon, we shall see.

In other news, the Spanish authorities have request Amorous Pixie's assistance, something to do with a sea monster attacking the beaches, it's got them running scared so she's flying out there on Saturday, she's not taking her Super Shuttle with her, so might borrow it and head down Alfreton, I hear there's some flame monsters that need a good roasting.

It's been quite an upsetting week that's jsut gone, Robo-Dog sadly passed on. His last battle was too much for him to handle. He had a good life, and he did damn well - Farewell Robo-Dog you deserve to have peace now.

However it was a glorious weekend before that - we got a load of the Order of Superheroes and Villains together and me and Amorous Pixie consolidated our power, we're now stronger than we've ever been before. I gave Amorous Pixie the sword of Valiance, crafted it myself, and entrusted into it the sacred stones, two of protection, and two of blood - hope it serves her well."

"event","Wow what a weekend, an amazing weekend of contrasts. I'll start at the beginning. (Warning, everyone's named in the main body of this post by their LJ names, I will however detail at the end, in a list, the alternatives for people's names. This is to make it simpler and more consisten so for instance <lj user=""sw_sfu""> is not then assumed to be a different person to Simon, or Beolach at various points in this retelling - the exception to this is C, who is always C in my journal).

<lj-cut text=""preamble"">
<b>Preamble</b>
So it's six weeks since I ased C if she would like to become handfasted with me. In that time, most of the preparation went into people. Having our friends there was very important to us, as they have been a vital part of our relationship, and I don't see why that will change. 

As the days got closer, I worked on the ritual, and also the gift for C (the exchange of gifts being part of the ceremony). I took a basic blade, and started at it with a couple of my small knives, reshaping it from a two bladed weapon, to a single bladed close combat weapon. Varnished it up, nice and red, wrapped leather to form the grip after adding a cut down guard, and then because it was something special, added some rose quartz to the pommel.

I also spent some time writing the ritual of course. We had originally been looking for books on the subject, but aside from being hard to find, we decided that we didn't want a cut and paste ritual for our special day, it had to be something important to us, hence having friends involved in the ceremony.

So time gets closer and closer, C hadn't been able to find a gift for me (I'm a bastard to buy for), so we planned on using the day before for shopping. Which brings us to Friday. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Friday"">
<b>Friday</b>
Met C at about 2pm, and we went round the shops looking for gifts. We looked at swords in a fishing shop, and at the royal armouries, but didn't find anything suitable. Couldn't find a hat that appealed either. Anyway, on our return from the Armouries, we stopped in at the fishing shop again, where I found a knife that appealed. Nice solid, sharp knife, rubber grip, perfect - simple, functional, and beautiful (in a deadly sort of way).

Then we went and got fish and chips, and sat down by the river for a while, which was really nice. When it was round about time to meet <lj user=""elarieldw""> at the coach station we headed over, and spent a few bored minutes waiting around. Was great to see El again, went into the station. The pubs there were packed, so we headed to Subway as El wanted to eat. Then Greg arrived, and whisked her away to Bradford, leaving me and C alone for ours. We went to Morrisons and boughts things for the picnic (tortilla wraps, fillings, drinks, etc...), then it was back down to the coach station to be bored for a few hours awaiting the arrival of <lj user=""sw_sfu"">, we got so bored we took a long and laborious walk back to Morrisons to pick up crisps and quiche which we had forgotten, however it had shut by then. So we headed back to the coach station, where C discovered the joys of the java games on my phone - specifically the pool game where she has extraordinary amounts of luck.

At just after 10pm <lj user=""sw_sfu""> arrived, and we hopped on a bus back to my house. Where we introduced <lj user=""sw_sfu""> to my family, had pizza, watched Death to Smoochy, and America's Sweethearts, followed by crappy early hours TV. We got to bed sometime between 3am, and 4am.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Saturday"">
<b>Saturday</b>
C woke up about 7am, and I awoke about half an hour later. We got up, I started work on the picnic stuff, while C did whatever her morning ritual is :p. We chatted, kissed, and did the usual stuff in the meantime. Family arose, followed by <lj user=""sw_sfu"">, who's very lazy and couldn't get up (even though it was like half past nine!). Once he did, and he went through his morning rituals, we headed to the shop at the top of the street to get more stuff for the day. Then walked all the way back home, dropped the stuff off, and headed for the bus.

As the bus got into the station, a sharp eyed C spotted <lj user=""m31andy"">, with some other girl (she'd never met <lj user=""cuvalwen""> before, who was with <lj user=""m31andy"">), after a brief description I realised it was who they thought it was. Texted them to find out what was happening. Half an later <lj user=""sw_sfu""> and C, headed out into Leeds to meet up with them, leaving me at the station to meet everyone arriving by train. Which is when <lj user=""joolsmd""> and her troupe turned up.

A bit after C, <lj user=""sw_sfu"">, <lj user=""m31andy"">, and <lj user=""cuvalwen"">, returned from town. I started making plans for sending the main body of people off, and me staying behind to meet the remainders, however people kept arriving, and the disappearing to shops and loos as per requirement. Eventually sent everyone off on the bus, while I stayed behind to meet <lj user=""elarieldw""> and <lj user=""lunrwolf""> who predictably were running late (though they claim otherwise as I was operating an half hour grace period). For being late, they had the penalty of coming back to my house to pick up the stuff for mine, <lj user=""sw_sfu"">, and C's picnic that were left behind (on the basis that I was having to go back to the house after the station anyway). Back at mine, by a stroke of good timing <lj user=""missmagic"">, and <lj user=""naimh""> arrived by car and parked up.

Then en masse towards the valley we were having the handfasting in. It was very hot, and very hard going, but we made it after about forty minutes (on a normal day it's a fifteen minute walk, with five minutes to the spot we were headed). Once there we met the first group that had set off. All chilled out from relaxing after their walk. We started the picnic, though I had to dash off and meet <lj user=""voodoopussy""> and <lj user=""cujosmurf""> to guide them from the valley entrance to the handfasting spot. It was so hot, and large areas of grass doesn't give much cover from the early afternoon sun.

So we got everyone there, we chilled a bit longer, recovering from the arduous trek throgh 26 degree temperatures. Fortunately, the choice of a circle of trees was excellent as though it was sunny and warm all around, inside the circle it was wonderfully cool (well less warm). We mingled and chatted, ate and drank. At about half past three (ish), we started the handfasting.

Okay, by now most people know what happened in the handfasting, though up unti the ceremony itself, it was a closely guarded secret between myself, C, <lj user=""mousedemon""> (who performed the ceremony), and our six honour guards (<lj user=""missmagic"">, <lj user=""elarieldw"">, <lj user=""sw_sfu"">, <lj user=""cujosmurf"">, and <lj user=""m31andy"">.

I'll take a few moments to explain some of the days around the ceremony itself:

Okay the ceremony can basically be divided into three elements. The mistress of ceremonies (best, and most fun title we could think of for <lj user=""mousedemon"">), the subjects (me and C), and the honour guard (as listed previously). 
Within that you have basically four phases - <lj user=""mousedemon"">'s words of union, the honour guards offer of protection, mine and C's vows to one another, and the exchanging of gifts, and the ending of the ritual, with thanks to people who attended and took part.
The main bulk was an affirmation between me and C over what we meant to each other, the personification of unified souls.
It was a very laid back and relaxed ritual, and it included friends as these are important to both myself and C, and to our relationship. It had humour and levity, but also some serious words - which to me is the perfect way to mark a union as it's meant to be a happy thing, yet with a serious undertone of two people coming together, for better or worse (to nick a famous phrase). It was also not meant to be perfect in the strictest sense, if something starts off with no problems, and every happens exactly to plan, then it's not really a good starting point. So mistakes are acceptable, as both myself and C will make mistakes, and it's about going forward - which is what an act of union is, going forward.

So the ritual went perfectly (as in it was wonderful and there were no major problems that spoilt it), and I think most if not all enjoyed it. There were lots of gifts afterwards, some wonderful things were given, and thank you to everyone that gave. (I'll do a seperate post of thanks, plus to show off what we got ;) ). Then it was back into picnic and fun mode. Grass fights, food, drink, hide and seek. All took place, I think everyone had a great time. Some people had to leave early, but that was fine really as some of them we met back up with in town.

Which once the most of the food had been eaten, and most of the drinks drunk, we started to break up camp. <lj user=""naimh""> and <lj user=""missmagic""> set off back to mine to drive home. Everyone else a little while after made their way to the buses. Myself, <Lj user=""mousedemon""> and her hubby Neil (no LJ), got off early carrying as many of the bags of people staying at mine as we could, to save carting them round town. <lj user=""mousedemon""> got a shower at mine (poor woman really went through hay fever hell to be here for me and C, need to find a way to really thank her and show our appreciation).

Then it was in to town again for drinks and fun in Revvies. A lot of fun was had, and it seemed like a lot of vodka was drunk (but that was down to three people). There was a situation, but I won't cover that here.

A few surprise people came, specifically <lj user=""beautifulcreep""> popped in. 

Then about half past nine, it was going home time. Most of us were tired from the walking, and the heavy heat of the day. Back at mine we chilled, I was ordered by <lj user=""sw_sfu""> to subject everyone to Death to Smoochy, and they were suitably disturbed. Spent a lot of the night talking politics, religion, and warfare with <lj user=""mousedemon"">'s t'other half Neil, which was quite fun. Though boring for everyone else :p

Then it was time to retire to bed, after some organising everyone had a place to sleep - hope it wasn't too uncomfortable for anyone. Though kind of by accident, me and C ended up with the conservatory to ourselves. It as a sort of poetic symmetry to it, in that in a lot of ways, that marked when we actually started as a couple back in September, (no that has nothing to do with sex for the dirty minded folk :P ).
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sunday"">
<b>Sunday</b>
Sunday was a relatively quiet day. Woke up late(ish), and tried to chill out in the intense heat. Showed <lj user=""cuvalwen"">, <lj user=""mousedemon"">, and <lj user=""m31andy""> the Jack and Daniel Stargate video montage that goes along with the song Stay. (If anyone that saw it wants it, I can't remember where it came from, however can email it, or send it by MSN if you need it). Then after plenty of drinks, and chat, and random comments from <lj user=""m31andy""> (e.g. ""I read too much gay porn"", ""I wish I had a prostrate"" and a few more :P) there was also an appearance from <lj user=""andys_laugh"">. <lj user=""sw_sfu""> also had his own funny lines (e.g. ""I got a dent in the boulard"", followed by ""I don't know how to get it in"")

About lunch time we headed into town, had a drink in the Old Royal Oak, me and C took <lj user=""sw_sfu""> to the coach station where he headed off home, and the rest of us headed for drinks and chat in Revolutions. <lj user=""m31andy"">, <lj user=""cuvalwen"">, and C left about half past five, after drinks and food. Leaving myself, <lj user=""mousedemon""> and Neil to continue talking and having a laugh.

We decided to leave Revvies early as we were far too comfortable, and warm, and sleepy, so we braved the rain (yep storm hit Leeds), and headed into Wetherspoons in Leeds Train Station, were we talked sport, politics, about the handfasting and such. As we were leaving Revvies though we were struck by a stroke of fortune. The early drinks and food had been on a tab, which the staff at Revvies had lost on their systems. They thought one of the three that had left early had paid it. So that was drinks and snacks in Wetherspoons paid for.

Round about eight, <lj user=""mousedemon"">, and Neil headed for their train home, and I left to go back to my house. Very tired, very achey, and sun burnt, but despite any moaning, it was an amazing day, and all the hardships were worth it, and I would do it again without hesitation - though maybe a bit better planning travel and accomadation wise. </lj-cut>

Thank you for everyone that made this day special, thank you for C for being daft enough to want to spend the rest of her life with me. Thank you for the gifts. Thank you for the well wishes.

Coming up later on <lj user=""randompix""> there will be loads of photo's of the weekend posted.

For now I shall try and get a list here of everyone's names, and LJ user names, and PN usernames for people who have short memories, and want to keep in contact with new friends. I'll probably edit this about eight or nine times as people correct mistakes, and absent details.

"event","Today we had many a battle against evil forces, including some form of entity that can change time and space... whoever it was it got away.

My first port of call this morning was to fly to the Leodis train station, Amorous Pixie was running late though, she was delayed on her super shuttle from her secret base somewhere near York. Darn train service, don't they know us Superheroes have jobs to do. While I was there, I educated myself on the Kr-lax'u manual, the Kr-lax'u are an interesting race, however Leodians distrust of these misunderstood extra-testrials was manifest in the odd looks I got for reading the manual. However, my new suit was off putting enough for no one to actually bother me.

My new suit was a black studded leather affect (the leather in fact being made from the hide of a wooley mammoth that I had to tangle with Lord Nombre was briefly usurped by Lord Babele who had control of a time machine), and my energy force empowered spikes.

Anyway, Amorous Pixie finally managed to hide her super shuttle on a often unusued track inside the Leeds city station. We departed the station, and we knew without saying a word that our first stop had to be to sort out weaponry at the government armouries... of course they didn't know we were going, however rumour had it they held some fine captured weaponry that would come in handy. I settled for a mighty war hammer, Amorous Pixie eagerly settled on a fine array of enchanted daggers and knives.

Upon leaving the Armouries were attacked by killer birds, however after much effort we managed to scare them off. They're only government tools after all, no harm in letting them live, their attacks bounced off my armour. I don't think I'll be seeking any government help in my quests anytime soon.  They may not take likely to a raid, even in the name of defeating the evil forces of Lord Noia.

We rode out of their on some fine steeds. Next we were faced with Skylla, (a sea monster or she-dragon), who'd managed to make it's way down the river Aire. It had come to fight Amorous Pixie and was so intent on her target, that I had the opportunity to hammer down on her tail when he flapped out of the water. Pixie then reversed the thrusts of the creature's six dogs for legs... while inside the creature's guared, she cut at the serpentine body. I threw Pixie my enchanted blade and she killed the creature, beheading it totally. I took most of the creatures scales for some new orange armour. Well can't let good dragon scales go to waste, especially not ones from such a powerful beast.

We took respite in a local cinema house, however it wasn't long before we were attacked by ice demons, even there. They used their impressive brain freeze powers on us, however my woolley mammoth armour offered a great defence against them keeping me warm and free from the pain of cold. I quickly dispatched them with my war hammer, then just to make sure I melted them down to water. If they some how recovered, they'd have no recognisable bodies, just pools of water, or sheets of ice.

Hey, I know your thinking I'm cruel... I may be a hero but I never claimed to be a good guy. I do whatever I after, in the world of superhero's, villains, and other creatures, it's kill or be killed. If you'd seen the things I had you'd realise the importance of making sure all enemies are defeated no matter what.

We got to enjoy our respite... and we were off back into the city again, prepared to battle evil-doers. However I was caught off guard by a Manto Stradale, it managed to score a lucky hit on my weakest point, my ankle. (Yes I am well aware that a strike to the ankle caused Achilles to die. However I'm a superhero I'm not myth, I cna survive it. My intense mental abilities allow me to control pain.) We dealt with it, but it was a long drawn out battle. Upon dispatching my would be killer, we made our way to the canal to recover. However once there, we came under the affects of the aforementioned entity that bent time and space on us. We couldn't tell here from there. We ended up lost in the wilderness of Leeds, however then I remembered the twine of destiny, I loosed it upon where wanted to be, or thought we did, and we were there. However someone had tried to break into Pixie's super shuttle, and the shuttle had run away. I spied blood, many drops leading in a line. We guessed the shuttle had defending itself, and run off, with the mysterious would be theif chased. We follow the trail to where the shuttle had parked itself. Causing all manner of chaos with the trains. However Pixie got away fine.

"event","Tonight was on whether superheroes and villains could qualify as a superhero or villain based on their abilities (and whether those abilities have to be natural such as technological, or petanatural such as xray vision, and super strength), or their deeds. Quite a few people attended the discussion.

Those in attendance while I was there:
Amorous Pixie
Sheepman
Sleeping Muffin
Gerbil Boy
and quite a few others. Obviously there's much disagreement. Some believe that the ability makes the hero or villain, others believe that relying on technology doesn't really prove anything, others believe it's all based on the number of lives you've saved, and yet more solely on how many bad or good guys you've jailed or killed.

It's been quite an interesting debate, it looked a little slow to start with. You put a bunch of villains and heroes together, and everyone's nervous of fights breaking out... but it went well.

Other than that... it's just been a relaxing day back at my lair. There was a slight problem with some minor villain attacking people, but me and Invisible Girl teamed up with the Mad Magician in stalling their plans. It worked out well, even if myself and Invisible Girl were only side kicks in this adventure. It's not about blasting off with Flaming Sword, or Mind Warp, it's about the job being done.

I laid out some plans today, my underhanded mission to take the planet of Fic'tion Er'os over seems to be going well. My pawns are just moving into place at the moment. It's a very important mission, as I can save the people there from intense power of Lord Nombre."

"event","That's my Sunday. Don't really have much planned, online discussion at seven. Other than that, chatting and surfing t'internet. Going to make a few icons me thinks.

Wish Amorous Pixie was online, miss her. Wolf Mistress is though, it's always good to talk with her, not seen her in so long, miss her too IRL. The Scorpion's in chat too, which is great, actually been talking with her quite a bit recently, after a long gap in betweem. It's good that we're still friends.

Any ideas for new icons greatfully accepted"

"event","The Meet today is great, so many new faces, and the regular cast were back today too. Which is always good. How the pitchers did flow with the drink of Gods and of man.

Everyone seemed to have a great time today, it was a really great experience. Was but back in July when I doubted the very future of my most cherished moot. Now everything's great, there's five regulars (those that have been to more than three moots), and some who seem set to be regulars. 

It really does feel great.

Am watching William Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet (1990's version, with Leonardo DiCaprio), it's a good film. I know too many faults in it for it be a brilliant retelling of the tale. Puts me in the mood to read the play though, which conveniently I got for Christmas.

Will post more about last week later :)"

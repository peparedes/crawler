"event","All through my life I wanted marriage and kids. But recently after thinking and observing I decided I don't ever want to get married. I used to say I will just get married once and that's it but now I don't even want that. I've&nbsp;discovered most couples do not last long-term anymore. And if they do last something probably happen during it. Like cheating for&nbsp;example. Many people cheat now&nbsp;and their significant other forgives them. I personally could not stay with someone who cheated on me if I knew about it.&nbsp;It would make me sick&nbsp; to my stomach imagining them with someone else. I don't even want to be in a relationship anymore. Everyone tells me you&nbsp;haven't met the right one. Well you know what I've met plenty of people who think they are with the right one and someone new comes along. These are people who are considering marriage. I just can't believe in love anymore. I know people love each other but it's thrown around so easily. I have loved men but I have never been in love with a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just feel nothing is special anymore. Sex is thrown around as easily as love. So, my idea is to become a cat lady. No serious relationships just me. I am the only person who has to stay with me. I know I have friends and family who love me. But everyone eventually gets their own families and contact dwindles. Well that is my&nbsp;rant for now."

That was a long painful route I'd rather not discuss. I am with a new guy. So far things have been great and hope it continues. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Psychology. I got a new apartment because I couldn't stand living at home. It was too small and Paul was difficult to deal with sometimes. I am starting a new job as Assistant Program Director aka Assistant Manager for the May Institute. I will be working with adults with MR.

Speaking of which, my mom is getting married in July pretty crazy?!? I tried on my dress for the wedding, it is so big on me. For spring break I went to Disney with Jenn. We stayed in Kissimmee. It was my birthday gift to myself. I had a good time. We had a crazy shuttle driver and a crazy cab driver on the way back to the airport to go home. Gave us some good laughs however. I decided I am not happy with my job in New Bedford, so during the summer I am going to look for a new school job. I did however turn 21 not too long ago. The two places I got drinks at didn't ID me. Actually, I've only had two drinks since I turned 21. Maybe I need to get a buzz going here. Next year I will be moving into the 21+ apartments with my friend Lyns, my friend Shannon from high school and her friend. Should be a good experience. I will get my own room with a full bed. YAY!! Well thats about all that's really happen so I am out!"

That went pretty well they all seemed to like him. He and my cousin Dan got along well. I got to see my two nieces which I only see once a year. I got a good amount of money and a few gifts on Christmas day. On Christmas day I went over to my brothers house, that was pretty good. I got to see my nephew which I don't see much.

Yesterday, I stayed with Chris. He didn't feel too well so we didn't do nothing to much but watch the ball drop. I know I gave him the cold originally I just hope I don't get it back. 

I started looking into graduate schools today. I might have to go out of state to get into a good school. We'll see what happens. I think I am going to aim for my PhD in clinical psychology. I can't wait to start working in mu career. Working with the mental ill will be an amazing experience. I don't mind working with special needs for now, but it is not what I want for a career goal.

In other news, my friggin health insurance is getting cancelled in feb. So I have to figure out what I am going to do about that. I did however get my loan for college, which makes me wicked happy. Only a year and a half left and I will have my BA in Psychology."

"event","I found this quote to perfectly explain how I feel...

""Friends. A simple word isn't it? It's uttered everyday to almost every person imaginable. Who are your friends? I used to think that friends were the people that you could laugh and talk to. Now I know that friends aren't that, they're the people that touch ur heart. You could spend hours with them doing nothing at all and it can be the best time of your life, just because it was with them. They're the people you can
share your secrets with, cry with, laugh with, and just have fun with. They don't judge you or make you change. They accept you exactly as you are. They look at you and they see a great person, one they love spending time with. You all share something in common and are tied together by memories, tears, laughs and smiles. You're tied together by love for the other. Friendship is the strangest but greatest thing in the world. I find my time with my friends, the best times of my life. My friends are my heart, my soul, my fun, my laughter, tears, love and my life."""

"event","Well yesterday was Rachel's 21st Birthday, so I drove back to Weymouth after doing an hour of volunteer work. We took her to Daedalus in Cambridge. We had to wait alittle bit to get a seat so we sat at the bar, of course I couldn't get anything because I am underage. Rachel loved the place and all of her gifts. I wish I had more money so I could get her a better gift, but all I could afford was a card and some cash. She liked it though because she likes recieving mail and I mailed it to her previously. During dinner she got a mudslide, and was taking her time drinking it, I kept taking sips because I love kahlua. They kept offering to buy me a drink, but I was like no I have to drive and get up early. After dinner she and a few friends headed to a friends house, and I went home because I had to get up at 5:30am today to drive back to Dartmouth for my 8am class. But I am heading back to Weymouth Friday night. I know I am seeing Jenn and I might go out with Rachel again it depends. I can't til I am 21, I plan on going to providence the day of my birthday and hopefully the week after which is my spring break, I hope to go to Disney World. I got to start planning that soon. So, far it's just me and Jenn, I'd like more people but I don't know who wants to or who can afford to."

"event","Well, tomorrow I start training for my job. If I am comfortable enough Saturday I will work the whole shift. I am so poor these days. I had to borrow money from my pops. I hate feeling like I have to depend on others. 

Something I have realized lately, is that I am alot happier. I am not sure if I have mentioned this in a previous entry or not. It's not because I have a boyfriend. It's one probably because I am on zoloft even though it is the lowest dose. But ever since I have had a more positive outlook on life. Yeah, I have my problems, I am in huge debt, I have tons of school work that confuses me, etc. Lets stay off that subject. Most of my teen years if not all of them I spent dwelling on things that made me feel depressed. I know now that it must have been annoying hearing ""I should just kill myself, I wish I could just disappear, no one likes me, I suck."" Honestly, at the time part of me felt like I was doing it for attention but at the same time it was the way I felt and I knew I needed help. I was getting to the point where I was having breakdowns constantly. Every little thing would set me off. I know I was a miserable person to be around. And I would like to thank anyone who listened to all my bullshit. Yes, a big part of my depression was Joel, and I am still not over all that shit 100% but it does not bother me as much. I am able to live my life without worrying about what he did or will do. But I can't blame him for all of it. There were many other things that happened that made me depressed. The worse thing I did is refuse to get the help I needed. Right now I love myself. Yes, I think there are things I could improve but who doesn't? Before I hated everything about myself. Since I have this new outlook it is easier for me to talk to people, obviously I am still shy but not as shy as I used to be. I got rid of the people in my life who were making me feel like shit and now I have great friends. I love my friends! Well that's enough of my babbling!"

I am still in the process of looking for a job while I am here. I might just have to go back into the customer service business. Ugh! As for other news when I left my job I was very sad, some of the clients were crying because they didn't want me to leave. But I am on relief which means I can go back when I am on breaks.

But as for now I am going to make a list of things I've learned about myself or in general...
1. Drinking every night is stupid
2. Drugs are stupid
3. Drinking to socialize occasionally is good, but not to get shitfaced
4. No matter how horny I get I could never sleep around single or not
5. I honestly just don't care about things as much anymore, I am not saying I don't care about my future or friends and family. I don't care about stupid insignificant things that used to break me down into a nervous wreck.
6. Having a boyfriend is fun, if it doesn't last who cares. I am young I will move on and there are plenty of others out there.
7. I love my friends!
8. I am more open to new people, still shy but not as bad
9. I want to go out somewhere some night, don't know where just somewhere
10. I love babies, and want one!

"event","So, this weekend was an interesting one. Saturday night I went with Chris to his friends Dave and Julia's wedding. It was outside at Bristol Community College. It was nice. I ended up sitting with his friend Chris because he was an usher. I was also supposed to sit with his sister but she never came back. He kept offering to buy me a beer, but I don't like beer. The groom was pretty drunk by the end of the day, he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek saying he appreciated that I came.

Sunday I went to the mall to look for some more clothes for school. Well we had a bad downpour and I tried to drive home, but realized that I couldn't see. So, I decided to pull in a parking lot and sit in the car. Chris said he'd feel safer inside. I made my way to the movie theater. We decided to see the Skeleton Key. It seemed like it would be good. The movie went out twice, except the second time we lost complete power. When it came back on we had the choice to get passes or stay and watch the movie. We got passes and headed home while the rain had stopped.

Yesterday I went to warped tour. We headed out around 9am and didn't get there till about 3:30pm. It was only supposed to be a two hour drive. Near the end of the Mass Pike we hit all the warped tour traffic, it sucked. But when we finally got there it was all muddy. We went to the offspring booth, and then the Dropkick Murphy one. I bought a Dropkick shirt that says Kiss me I'm shitfaced, with the tour dates on the back. We got right up front for the Dropkick Murphy after watching Avenged Sevenfold. They were pretty good, I think I might buy a CD. Dropkick Murphy was awesome. I took a few pictures on Chris's cell phone. After that we headed to get some water before I passed out. We then had to listen to the Transplants, so we could move to the front again for the Offspring. We made it up front. I was so anxious. When they finally came on stage I started jumping all over the place. I loved it. Someone moved and I ended up all the way to the railing. I got squished wicked bad and the staff kept standing in front of me because of damn crowd surfers. But I loved it! That was the closest I have ever been at a concert! I lost my pair of sneakers because they were all muddy, so I have to search for a new pair!"

I will make sure I get Kelly because the new lady did them all uneven. Also, I bought a cell phone clip and a new purse. Jenn bought me a pair of sunglasses. That girl spoils me so much lol. I don't usually spend money on myself but I figured since all school year I will basically just paying bills. I might as well while I have the chance. 

Last week I went to the dentist and I had to get a root canal. That racked up my debt because I have no dental. Now I have a monthly plan for that, $82 a month. I hate bills. And to think once I get that, plus my credit cards paid off. I will have to start paying my college loans.

As for college, I have to catch up on classes so I can graduate in 2 more years with my BA in Psychology. Which means summer and winter classes for me. I am thinking of applying at Saint Vincents in Fall River. It's for kids and teens who have been emotionally or physically abused. I know it is going to be hard because they can hit you and try to make you feel like shit. But I figure if I can deal with that than I can definetly become a psychologist. The next two years of school are going to be tough. My goals are to get all As and Bs, pay my bills off, go to the gym atleast 3 times a week, and eat healthy. Lets hope I achieve it all."

"event","Well I finally changed my belly button piercing from a ring to a barbel with a dragon on it. Woohoo! It pinched alittle and yet again the two guys I saw there were attractive. It never fails when I go there, that I think most of the guys are attractive. 

As for my job, things are going pretty good now. It seems I am staying with Group C which is good because I really like that group. The clients there are so fun. They do have there tempers sometimes, but other than that it is cool. I am always tired though. I am not a morning person at all. 

Thursday I went to six flags. I was forced on the superman again! UGH! It was a pretty fun day besides feeling like an outcast because it was me and two other ""couples"". I got a nice sunburn on my shoulders. 

I have been having some thoughts lately. I don't know what to make of them. I will share more once I understand what I want to do. =/"

"event","So, after about a week at work, I am kind of annoyed. First everyone talks about everyone behind their backs. I feel like I am in high school again. It sucks that all women do is gossip. I'll admit, I am guilty of doing it myself sometimes. But I don't remember ever doing it in the work environment. And anything I have to say is because I am mad at the person. Not because I feel the need to talk. Also, I think it's kind of rude when the workers make comments about the clients private parts. Also they seem to make fun of them. It makes me think what if Kendra was still alive and people said shit like this about her. It pisses me off. Maybe I am just being to anal. But I needed to get it off my chest."

"event","Well Saturday I finally saw Star Wars. It was great, I loved it. I wanted Hayden Christensen the whole time, along with my new recent obsession Ewan McGregor. Other than me being in lust with those two, the movie kept my interest. I saw the original Star Wars, but I never saw episodes one and two. I should probably see them so I can complete the story.

Yesterday was good because I just had a night out with a few girls. We went to UNOs for dinner, Friendly's for icecream and lastly we rented Shark Tale and went back to Rachel's house to watch it. Good times. I should do it more often. 

I have been so bored lately, because of the lack of a job. And I don't go out to often."

"event","Well it appears lately I have alot going through my head. I am not really going to get into details, but it's basically just college, jobs, and relationships. But what else is new. Life has it's ups and downs. And I know I tend to over dramatize everything. People tell me all the time I worry too much, but it's just in my nature. 

I bought myself the movie, ""Down With Love"" I can't help it I love chick flicks. I always think why can't I experience love like that. It gives me a chance to imagine a guy who actually cares. But it is all a fantasy. Love doesn't work like that. And guys don't chase the girl. Well, rarely. 

I am sick of rain. I do not like rain, it makes me all depressed, bored, and sleepy. Last night however, I did go out with my mom because I had to after the bad news I recieved about my grades. I don't really have much else to say because I don't do anything. Maybe one day I will have an interesting tale to tell but for now I leave you..."

I then went for my interview for the job working with adults with special needs. I think I might get that. I am aiming for the day center in Hingham which would be 8:30-4:30 Monday thur Friday. I hope I get it it's good pay and 40 hours a week. 

As for other stuff, I hate being right about some things. Joel is moving back from Florida. I knew it, I said he was going to come back in the summer. And he's calling Jon again and since Jon links to Jenn I am pretty sure I will have to run into him again. God help me. Oh well shit happens.

As for other stuff I seem to be doing good on the Meds. I don't overreact like I used to. When something bad happens I get upset, but move on rather quickly."

Today I had my History final. It wasn't too bad, I believe I passed but no A or anything. Tonight I have to study for my Human Geography final. 

Tonight is my last night at BSC. I have to fill out my withdrawal form. I will probably do that on Friday. As long as I get a C- or higher all my grades will transfer. Yay!

"event","Well I guess it's been alittle while since I have updated this. I have been stressing about my grades alot this semester. I haven't been doing too good on my tests, plus it doesn't help that I hate 90% of my classes. I just finished writing most of my final paper for philosophy. It is due on Monday so I am ahead of the game. I need all the other time to study for my finals on Monday and Tuesday. I can not wait to get the fuck out of this school. My eyes have been hurting me lately and I am always tired I hate it. I am moving home on Tuesday night. I will have my own room for the first time since I was 16. YAY! I might be working this job with special needs people. I am not sure since I know it is alot of hard work. But it is a good pay and I could really use the money. That is if I even get the job. I also applied to Bank of America, Sovereign, and Rockland Trust. So we will see what happens. If I do not get any of those I will have to start looking for an average retail job I guess. But the Randolph movie theater will be a last resort. Man, I hated that job, but I know I can get the hours I want. I am aiming for 35-40 hours a week. I need to lower my credit card bills and car insurance will be coming back in soon. AHHHH!! But the good news is I will be going to Warped Tour this summer. Did I already mention this? Oh well. Lately, I have been having wanting a baby. I know that I am not ready. It's just every time I see Haley and hold her it makes me feel happy inside. It makes me wish I had one of my own. But believe me I am not rushing into that. I still need to finish college and get my life in line. But I guess it is normal for a woman to want a baby. Well, that's all for now..."

"event","So I hung out with my cousin Melissa the other day. We started talking about the old days and the Pat came up. Oh man, for those of you who don't know this was like the ""love of my life"" when I was about 12-14. I was talking about how I wonder what he looks like now because I haven't seen him since I was like 13. Then we started talking about 3 ninjas. It was nice to get out with her. I always wonder how close her and I would be if that whole Kevin incident didn't happen. lol So anyways, yesterday when she gets home she finds a picture of Pat. I was like Holy Shit he's changed. Then she finds that him and I believe my cousin Dan recorded 3 ninjas on her camera. I was like hmmmm, alittle ironic? 

Well I've been talking to my old friend Michelle again. It's pretty cool, I used to miss that girl sooooo much. We used to be wicked close back in like 9th-10th grade. It was good times, although we were depressed all the time. 

This week I have just been wicked lonely and depressed. I sat in the room all alone all week because I was nervous to drive and go see people. I hate being sick. I feel better though now. It was bad though I called my mom like 300 million times, and I called Jenn alot too. I am so glad her and I are doing okay now. I was so scared for awhile there that I was going to lose her. I get scared of losing alot of people. I love my friends and family and I don't want to lose any of them. I know I screw up sometimes and forget myself for awhile, but it doesn't mean I don't care. 

Lastly, I need a summer job. Anyone have any ideas?"

"event","Well I went to the doctors yesterday. Turns out I have vertigo. Why is it when I get sick I get these extreme things. Last two times I was sick before this I had the flu and then gastritis. Well in case you want to know, Vertigo is a type of dizziness that's characterized by the sensation of spinning. It's sometimes referred to as a hallucination of motion. Imagine what it would feel like to be placed suddenly on a roller coaster that won't stop, and you begin to understand the alarming symptom of vertigo. And because of this I want to be a 100% straight edge. I can't imagine how people live high or drunk everyday. This shit sucks.

In other news I cried over Kendra a few nights ago. It's only the third time I've cried over her. =( Today I get to see Chris's neice. Yay for babies!

"event","Well lately I've been feeling kind of shitty. It sucks to realize some of your friends really don't seem to care about you anymore. Oh well, I guess life just goes on. I know some people still care, though it is very few. On another note I just want to forget that my birthday is coming up. I know it is going to suck anyways. Now don't get me wrong I am not going back into my depressed state of mind. I just am sad with the way things seem to be working out right now. So, I'd rather just get this shit done and over with and move on with my life. Hopefully, next year at UMass everything will be better. I have a friend to start off with since Vanessa goes there. I can't wait for summer, I hate the snow, I hate being inside with nothing to do. But before I drive anyone insane with my bitching, I am out."

"event","Firstly, I am going to vent in this entry so if you don't want to deal with it don't read it. 

I have been doing alot of thinking lately, and I've come to the realization that I don't really have any friends. I have people who say they are my friends, but I know honestly could give two shits about me. My best friend doesn't even call me anymore. And now it seems whenever we talk something different annoys her. Maybe the horrible thing has happened. We are drifting apart. That is going to suck insanely if that is the way it has to be. But I love Jenn and if she wants that, then I will do that. The good thing is next school year is a new start for me. I am going to be going to a different college, hopefully meeting new people that want to see me and talk to me. I need to remove all this negative shit from my life. Well, I'm done for now."

"event","Well my weekend was kind of interesting. On Friday I went home to do my laundry and go to the movies. I went to see Constantine. It was a pretty cool movie. I heard alot of people didn't like it. But I did, so oh well. Saturday morning I did my taxes. Fun stuff right there, I am getting shit back but atleast I have money to pay back Ashley for Montreal. 

Sunday I went to Chris's sisters baby shower. It was in some bowling alley in Westport. He also brought along his friends Dave, Julia, their baby Emma, Mike, and his girlfriend Lisa. I felt like his whole family was just staring at us in silence for some reason. I was nervous, but it would appear Lisa was more nervous than me. Especially when Chris's aunt announced to the whole family she ate McDonalds before she came. After the party Mike and Lisa went home. Then Chris, Julia, Dave, and I dropped off Emma at Dave's mom's house. We had plans to go to the movies, but decided to go bowling instead. That was pretty cool. I lost the first game horribly. But the second game I came in second place to Julia by one point. I got a 96, go me. I am not used to bowling with the big balls, it was weird. Now I get to have a funfilled week of school work this week. I got a test tomorrow in Art History, a 5-6page paper in Philosophy due Friday, a history test and biology quiz also on friday. But the good thing is after friday I have a 2 week Spring Break. YAY!!"

I know I may be blowing this out of proportion, but this is the third time the computer is fucked up. Every time I get a computer, something goes brutely wrong. Plus if you know me I have a short fuse about things lately. I either get extremely angry, or extremely sad. I hate it, but my emotions are crazy."

"event","Well I guess I'll update you on the last few days. On monday Chris and I went to Ruby Tuesdays. I had never been there before. It wasn't bad. I learned some interesting facts about how guys check out girls..haha! After that I got him to watch the end of 13 going on 30. I am such a sap and girly girl sometimes. I got the movie The Notebook. I have yet to watch the whole thing. 

Yesterday, I went to the gym I only did a few things. I jogged on the treadmill for about 10 minutes. I also went on the machine where you move your arms and legs for 10 minutes. I did the bike for about 5 minutes. Somewhere in there I stretched and attempted crunches. That's pretty much all I have to say."

"event","So, I think only Ashley actually reads this journal. I guess no one else loves me. But as for other news things have been pretty boring. I just go to work, class, and see people occasionally. One month from Sunday is my birthday, exciting stuff right there haha. I heard it is supposed to snow tomorrow. I hate snow, it's been pretty nice lately why does it have to be ruined? Today I took two tests. I think I did okay on the Biology one, but as for the history one I have no idea. I have fuckin' cramps, this sucks ass. And I've course I got it a day earlier than usual to. So, I finally joined the gym. Next week I will begin my routine. I really didn't feel like going this week because I feel icky and unmotived. I am excited, once I get back into the hang of it I will love it again. Adrian called me last night at 1am.

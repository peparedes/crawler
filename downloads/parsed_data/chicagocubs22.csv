"event","I went to the y with john and we got school by these kids. It sucked. Well i would tell you more about my day but its all blurred bc ILLINOIS WON!!!!   This was honestly the best sports game I have ever seen in my entire life.  My house was going crazy.  Illinois down by 14 points with 2 minutes left, then they started nailing 3's left and right.  They tied it and sent it to overtime!!! and they won by 1 in over time.  CAN YOU SAY FINAL 4 BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Today was awesome. We did nothing in all of my classes. Also in spanish we watched ace ventura, and it was in english!  Can you feel that baby, huh huh huh. I have exercisssssed the demons.  Thats enough of that. After school i served john at basketball at the y.  And i pulled my neck in the process and now i cant turn my head to the right without it hurting like a bitch. But anyway, one of the hoops was at like 7 feet, and I ran up and got stuff by the rim!  how can that happen!  well i tryed again and i did a 180 and it was so badass. I felt like freakin lebron james. Well thats what happened today. OH YEA AND ILLINOIS MOVED ON TO THE ELITE 8 TODAY BITCHES!!!!!!!"

"event","School was alright. In spanish we watch 101 dalmations in spanish. I know what your saying, wtf is that all about, thats what I said too. Im still trying to memorize how to freakin count to 20 none the less watch and understand a whole movie. After school I had to play with jazz in the spring arts thing. It was pretty boring. We wear tuxes and me and whitey sported the white shoes, hell yes we did. Something about black dress pants and white sneakers looks awesome to me. Anyway thats my day. Comment away!"

"event","Well i took my integra into maaco today thinking it was going to be $300. Well it ended up totaling at $1050! My dad didnt care though bc hes saving money on me taking this car rather than if i bought another. Well anyway that money adds up quick. Can you say $600 dollars worth of body work, just for like 3 dents. I got this metallic blue color that is kick-ass, except I was looking at in in a little booklet. So basically im scared shitless waiting to find out what it looks like. Ill post pics when i get it back on wednesday or thursday. Cya"

"event","Wow, today was actually boring as hell. Periods 1-6 were boring as usual, but 7th period we went to the media center. We were supposed to be working on these poetry projects but instead I found this awesome free mp3 site online and i started purposly trying to piss the people around me off, it was fun. I played hit me baby one more time on full volume and starting dancing in my chair. Lol, no im not a faggot. But instead of pissing everyone off I just made them laugh. Thats usually how it goes. Anyway, after school was jazz. I hate jazz so much, i dont know why the hell i even did it. The reason i hate it is bc there is this like 60 year old that does jazz and he plays trumpet. Hes the biggest douche bag ever. I mean he seriously thinks hes 17 years old. He says ""dude"" and ""man"" every other word. I dunno though, i think other people hate him too. Mr vagns cool though.  I just got home so thats all i have to write.

I just found out today that this past weeked he jumped off of the PCH bluffs and killed himself because he was on drugs. He has done drugs for as long as I have known him but I guess since I know so many people that actually do drugs, I did not think that he would kill himself.

"event","AMAZING...no other word can describe this week. I may have come really close to getting hyperthermia and had to sleep in a cramped Expedition because of the rain, but this week long trip to Mexico, to build four houses, with my youth group was one of a kind. It's funny how much you can actually learn about yourself and others when you are in this unique situation. 60 teenagers and 10 adults having to rough it without any real showers, toilets, tvs, stereos, and computers can really take a toll on people. But, I was surprised how the lack of every day necessities can open people's eyes to things that they would not necessarily have noticed had they been in a heated home with access to the internet and cell phone service. Do not get me wrong, I am extremely glad to be back at home with my nice shower and bed, but honestly, part of me wishes I was still down there..."

~Bowling night fundraiser.....we even had some seniors ditch Senior Bowling Night to come to ours!!! 
~Promenade.....last minute shopping at Macy's and GAP for jeans for Mexico.
~Analee's house.....Baked albino on the inside and black on the outside cookies, watched what I originally thought was called either Internal or External Sunshine, but I later found out it is actually called Eternal Sunshine, and won a pillow fight with Corey.
~Loaded up the vans and sorted dirty smelly tools and tarps that have not been used since last Mexico.


I CANT WAIT FOR TOMORROW!!!!!!! I am going down to Mexico to build houses. Last year was my first year and it was an unforgettable experience. I was talking with a couple of my friends about how much has happened in this past year. We have all changed, mostly for the good....but still change is change. We are not the little freshmen that we were last year. We have grown so much over these past 12 months. Some of us have become closer and others have drifted apart. Some have planned their future and some have not planned what they will wear tomorrow. I cannot help but wonder what we will all be like by the time the next Mexico trip comes around........."

"event","This weekend was well...interesting to say the least. I went up to the mountains with my youth group and it was awesome! In one really long run on sentence we...had snowball fights, made snow angels, hung out in the sleat, rain, hail, snow, got lost on the way to the cabin (in the rain, with our luggage at midnight), watched CP try to buy Brian diapers but the lady would not sell them becuase Brian was not the real kid, saw the guy from 7th Heaven. took pictures with the ""little toilest"", stole the guys mask, decorated the mask with pink hears and glitter, played with the studded animals in the gift shop, celebrated Jenny's birthday, met new people, taught Jordan how to blowdry her hair, spent an hour and a half drying our clothes, singing Karaoke, and almost getting frostbite/hypothermia.

But, I think that the most interesting part about the was what I learned. Going into this annual retreat, I always seem to think that I will come out of it a better person becuase of what the speaker taught me. But, this year, I came out of it a much better person because of what a 16 year old ex-convict taught me. I did not go looking to learn something from him, he actually found me when he chucked a snowball at me. He made some sort of mistake in his past and that landed him and his younger brother in Juvi. I did not find this fact out until after the snowball fight and I was shocked to learn that. To me he seemed like a perfectly nice guy, I could never imagine him doing something illegal. But, he did and he was recently released for probabation. I am not sure why, but he told me his ENTIRE life story! It seemed to scare almost everyone else in my youth group, but it did not seem to terrify me as much as it did the others. He made me realize that everyone really does make mistakes and that just because someone messes up, that does not necessarily make them a terrible person."

I have been part of my church's choir since Pre-K. My church has always been a safe haven for me. No one judges me and everyone has gone from just fellow youth groupies to becoming my family. I love them all dearly and slowly but surely they are all leaving.                                         Everyone knows that I hate to cry, especially infront of people. No matter how sad I may be, I try to act like nothing is really wrong. But when she announced that she had to leave, I startes to sob. I tried really hard to not cry, but all of the my compliants towards my church's changes were so welled up inside of me, that no matter how hard I tried, I could not hold it it. It just sucks to much when you begin to feel so attached to someone and then they decide to leave.......why do people leave? Why do things change?"

Maybe it was because I had my college handbook out or maybe it was because I realized that I only have 2 and a half more years before I will be enrolled in some college. To be completely honest, I do not know what I am worried about. Maybe it is that I am scared that I will not get into a good school. Maybe it is that I am scared to leave my friends and family.

15 Things You May Or May Not Know About Me:

1. When you first meet me, I may come off as really quiet. But, that is only because I am shy when I first meet someone. When I begin to feel comfortable around you, you cannot shut me up!
2. Two of my favorite movies are Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers.
3. I HATE liars and backstabbers! When I feel that I have lost someone's trust, it can be very hard to gain it back.
4. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone calls and does not leave a message, especially if they are a restricted number.
5. When I was 11 I had a mole removed because the doctor's thought that it was cancerous.
6. The only two things that I am allergic to are bee stings and yams.
7. Ever since I was little I have wanted to be either an actress, psychologist, or in the CIA.
8. I may not be athletic, but I love to go white water rafting and play basketball in the rain.
9. Before I die, I hope to be successful, travel the world, and have a loving family. 
10. I have attended the same church for my entire life and a few of my best friends go there.
11. I would much rather receive a heartfelt gift as opposed to a store bought one. 
12. Over the years I have gained seveal nickames including B-Roach, Great Britannica, and the B-Mister.
13. Sometimes, I wish I could stay a kid forever.
14. Even though I am not back from Winter Break yet, I cannot wait until summer vacation.

Yesterday was great! It started off going to the mall with Analee. We had a ton of fun and I got some awesome clothes! Later, we went ice skating for Abel's birthday. That was a blast despite me falling once. 

After talking to a ton of people about it, I am pretty sure that I am joining the school's swim team. I am looking forward to it and who knows....maybe we will be good enough that you guys will want to cheer us on :)"

"event","AWESOME past few days!


Wednesday: First, some last minute holiday shopping and Meet the Fauckes with Jeff! OMG that is such a hilarous movie! Everyone must see it! Then, he came over to my house. I gave him his gifts and we hung out for a while.

Thursday: I met up with Brian and David and we went to Brian's house and watched a movie after they attempted to practice what they are singing tonight at church. Later, we played What the F*ck (that is how its spelled on the box). It is some wierd drinking game (thats what it is ment for, but we just ask the questions...no drinking for us!) that Brian got from Urban Outfitters I think. That is one odd game.....thats all I can say! But, I pretty much won so it was ok. Then, we went to Souplantation for dinner and rehersal at church. 

Today: I finished up wrapping my parents Christmas gifts and I am going to  relax for a few hours. Analee is coming over at 3:30 so I can do her hair and makeup since we are going to be angels in our church's play tonight. Brian and Analee's family are coming over to my house for dinner before the service!

HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE!"

Bad morning but the rest of the day was great!

I met up with Renata and worked on the STUPIDEST bio project ever. I mean seriously who wants to spend four hours cutting and pasting about the genus Barbellus and answering hypothetical questions.

Then, I met up with Analee and we figured out how to bus to the Westside Pavillion and Jeff's house.After our little detour to Jeff's house we went shopping!!!!!!!!

Finally, we got back to Analee's house and we made homemade Mac & Cheese and watched Stepmom! That was the first time I saw it and I loved it!

The following are two poems that I found in The Chicken Soup for the Soul on Love and Friendship...


Jeff,
These past two months have been great! I love you so much!

You Are All This To Me
by Melissa Collette

Your the thought that starts each morning, 
the conclusion to each day.
You are in all that I do,
and everything I say.

You're the smile on my face,
the twinkle of my eye.
The warmth inside my heart,
the fullness in my life.

You are the hand that's laced in mine,
and the coat upon my back.
My friend, my love, 
my shoulder to lean on.

You're my silly, mature, caring, 
thoughtful, bright, and honest guy.
The one who holds me tightly, 
when I need to cry.

You're the dimple in my cheek,
the ever-constant tingle in my soul.
The voice that makes me weak,
The happiness of my life.

You are all I've wanted,
You are all I need.
You are all I've dreamed of,
You are all of this to me.


To all of my friends,
You are the greatest! I appreciate you all always being there for me especially during these past few weeks!

Why They Are Friends
by Kristy Glassen

Because...they smile.
Because...they understand just by looking into your eyes.
Because...they finish your sentences and know what you like.
Because...they know you better than you know yourself.
Because...with them you aren't afraid to be yourself.
Because...you can say something stupid or expose your deepest secrets to them.
Because...everything you do together becomes a memory.
Because...you don't need to do something special to have fun...fun just happens.
Because...you don't need to explain anything...they just know.
Because...they tell you the truth, no matter how much you'd rather not hear it.
Because...they would do anything for you and get you out of trouble.
Because...they make you laugh harder than anyone.
Because...they are not afraid to put themselves on the line for you.
Because...you can trust them.
Because...they believe in your dreams, no matter how silly they may seem.
Because...they dry your tears.
Because...you are good enough when you are with them.
Because...they love you for who you really are."

     These have seemed to be the longest two days ever. I have had some kinda flu/cold/who knows what and I feel really crappy. But, I am slowly becoming better and I have to be well to see Kenny's debut as Captain Hook in Peter Pan! I can't wait! 
    I can't wait for Winter Break. 3 weeks of no school, homework, tests, teachers, etc. This break is going to be the greatest. It is finally the holiday season and I already have everything I need (hint: #21). 
    I know that Spring Break is in like 4 months, but Analee wrote a really good article, for her school's newspaper, about last year's trip to Mexico to build houses for people in Tijuana. She told me that I could post her whole article, but it was really long. The last line was definitely the best. It said, ""Some people find themselves through writing or gardening, some through music or drawing.  For me, it took a trip to the middle of nowhere to discover what life was really about."" I am really looking forward to that trip. I will admit, last year I didn't do too well on the house. I had never been taught how to build anything before. I mean, I really sucked. I was hammering and missed the nail and hit my fingers a few times. But, it was by far one of the best trips I have EVER taken!"

Tae Kwon Do, camping out in my back yard, and sailing on her boat. That was certainly a trip down memory lane. We were all rocking out to Analee's new Hilary Duff's new cd.

"event","""Life isn't about keeping score. It is not about how many people call you and it's not about who you've dated, are dating, or haven't dated at all. It isn't about who youve kissed, what sport you play, or which guy or girl likes you. It is not about your shoes or your hair or the color of your skin or where you live or go to school. In fact, it's not about grades, money, clothes, or colleges that accept you or not. Life isn't about if you have lots of friends, or if you are alone, and its not about how accepted or unaccepted you are. Life just isn't about that. 
    But life is about who you love and who you hurt. It's about how you feel about yourself. It's about trust, happiness, and compassion. It's about sticking up for your friends and replacing inner hate with love. Life is about avoiding jelousy, overcoming ignorance and building confidence. It's about what you say and what you mean. It's about seeing people for who they are and not what they have. Most of all, it is about choosing to use your life to touch soneone elses in a way that could never have been achieved otherwise. These choices are what life is about.""  

    Yesterday was really fun. After school, Renata came over and we worked on our Survival Guide Project for Ms. Garcia's class. Then, Jeff came over and we played foose ball and watched Meet The Parents. 

    Today was also awesome. First, all of my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandma got together at the Jonathon Club for a nice brunch at the beach. Then, my parents and I went to Greg's ( a family friend's house ) Malibu beach house and we had another Thanksgiving dinner and got to watch the sunset.

    It is insane how much I have to be thankful for during this holiday season. As corny as it sounds, I really appreciate everyone who has impacted my life in some way or another. So.....to you all.....HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!!!!!"

I tend to overanalyze a lot. I will admit I do (well, I did a lot this past summer and beginning year but I am over that) But it was so funny when Charlie and I were talking about the Livestrong bracelets and why people really buy them and he gave his point. I questioned it and he went into a ton of depth about why it is just a fashion trend and he finished with, ""I dont overanalyze, everyone else underanalyzes.""

  ""When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."""

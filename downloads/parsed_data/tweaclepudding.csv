"event","Just got back from the beach after a relaxing afternoon watching lovelies in Bikinis.
My shoulders hurt a bit - need aftersun..
It's the Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon him) birthday today - so it'll be a dry night tonight (until we get back to the villa) which is just as well since my flight is tommorow.

"event","Well I got my sorry arse to Dubai.  Flight was shite with me sat next to a fat bloke who took half of my seat as well as his own.  It was also full of screaming kids.  Thank christ that as a frequenter of aircraft, I purchased some of those funky noise cancelling headphones a while ago.  They have the effect of having a volume knob on the engines of teh plane and more importantly- a volume knob on the kids.

Anyway - got here and went out with my mate Nik.  We met up with a few peeps, and what I want to know is this.  This is an Islamic state, so why did my head hurt so much this morning.  Surfaced about noon with a mouth as dry as a badgers dry bits.

Tonight is a decent meal and a bit of a booze up.

Is that ginger beer all gone yet?

Off to chill for a bit.

"event","Right - tommorow (Thurs) as you all no doubt know, is the end of my status as a (pseudo) student.
I am going to be shafted for a few hours and, no doubt fail.
I know that everything is pretty much certain and all that, and I've ranted to you all, either personally or LJ, But;
I'm crap at this sort thing.
I've got good will messages coming left right and centre - God whilst I write this line, one has just come in from Budapest!!!
But what is done is done, what is written is written and what is published is published.
All I can do is be as clear headed as possible - s on that note, I'm off to bed.
I've read up on all the stuff I used to know, re-read all my old papers etc and I can do little more.

If tommorow I'm feeling shite, you will all know whY, (as if it would be new news!) - If not, then you will find me somewhere, pissed as a fart.
Thanks for all the support.

"event","OK - here goes.....
1) some git is trying to sue me - arsehole!!!
It's complictated, he fell off bike and thinks he can get cash out of me!!  I was stationary and he was a twat - British justice - lets see wot happens!!
2) i'm in trouble with Bex for not noticing that some american lass was hitting on me.  I'm sure that this is a crime in a state or two, but it's certainly a crime in gob.
3) Shitting myself.
all this other shit is miniscule in comparison.  I have my viva next Thursday and whatever everyone says, it's fucking scary (just ask W_i_L.)  If one other person says the words ""you'll be fine"" I swear that they will die.  I've taken almost ten years to get to this stage and it feels like I should have quit nine years ago.  I know that the viva is the last stage and that ""they never let you get this far and fail you"", but ""they"" are all talking what feels like shit.  Ten years of my life are tied up in this and I've put various job options on hold for it.  It is a big deal and i'm shitting myself.  If I'm feeling a bit crabby, please ignore me, but heh.  I guess that afer next week it will all be over, but I'm not sure that I want it to be.  For the last ten years (well 9 3/4) I have had this goal in which I have focused myself (sometimes a little blurred admitted) but it has been so long, it is now part of who I am.  It feels like a chapter is coming to an end and I can move on whatever the outcome.
If i'm crabby, you all know that it's not personal, just stress (and I DON'T DO STRESS - SO FUCK OFF) and I'm sure that you are all right and I'll be fine.

Thanks anyway - even though a Dr is not likely.

"event","Right - I've got to work out how to use this now.

I've just spent about 20 mins adding the hon_bookie to contacts and now I can't find the bit of paper that non-goth Rob gave me with other LJ ID's

Help.

p.s 1st day back and the crap was even deeper than when I left.  

They are trying to get me to go to India now - yeah right!!! - the last bloke went for two weeks and spent two months there.  Nice place to visit, but not to work, especially with the ten hour cab ride from the airport."

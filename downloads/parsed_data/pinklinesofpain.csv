"event","I neva really said how Chris's halloween party went. it was ooook i guess. I didnt get to talk to mat as much as i would have liked to, but we played this fun strip poker-type game

im verry good at poker. but hehehehe not that night I wasnt =P

but anyways, we continued with the romanticisizm in english today. we read a poem about this guy whos wife and unborn child died. well the peom wasnt about HIM it was written by him, and surpsingly cheery. I dont like cheery peorty. potery s supposed to evoke deep inner feelings n thoughts in you, and the feelings deep donw in me arent very happy. plus how can you get truley emotional over something happy?!

ahhhh idk. im not bein emo, I just hate hearing people be all happy and disgustingly cheery when im so down. its just so inconsiderate to do that when im so ooooobviously sad :(

I love november!!!!!!!!!!

So many days off school!

Work tommorow =/ 3-6 shift though, so no bigg"

"event","things have been weird for me an allie since the other day. it sucks so bad becasue i value her friendship soooo much. i mean we dont hate each other but i think she realizes how im having second thoughts about it. it shouldnt have happened, i know i still love matt and it would be unfair of me to lead allie on like this. im not ready for another relationship. i just need to make it clear to her that it isnt becasue shes a girl i dont mind that at all, i just think it would be rushing things a little to jump right back into a serious relationship again. 

i dont know what to do :(

and honestly i've never felt shittier about myself

i'm never even myself anymore i'm just the Jessika that sits here and hopes for some compassion and hugs from someone who'll never care about me again

i miss him so much...


allie and casey came over 2day to try n cheer me up with coffee! that was really nice of them but later on once casey left allie was sending me all these wierd signals n stuff and well she knows about me being bisexual which is totally my choice and im totally not ashamed of my sexuality and well i think she was coming on to me and then we ended up kissing but i don't know how i feel about it and stuff because im not sure weather it was just a kiss or something more

i miss matt so much right now

so we all know what today is right :(

its realy sad to think about all those poeple that died and right here in my very own state. it makes me so greatful it didnt happen to me. i mean i wish it didnt happen to anyone at all but im so lucky it didnt happen to me or anyone that i love and care about.

im tryin really hard not to think about...you know....him. i mean ever since i've come back on the market, guys and girls alike have been all over me but no matter what I just can't seem to get my mind off of him. though HE seesmt o be adjusting JUST FINE to his new single life. I saw him the ither day with michelle enders. I dont really have a problem with michelle shes sat next to me in homeroom since freshman year and shes never really been mean to me but I can't help but feel a little bitter towards her ya know

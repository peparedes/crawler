As degrading as it sounds, to me right now, women are like pie. Not like the pie you eat, the pie you look at in a Denny's showcase. You see the pumpkin pie and you think, oh, I'm in love. I've always loved pumpkin pie, why I've loved it since about eigth grade when I starting making pumpkin pie. Man i remember this one time I gave nancy a pumpkin pie for her birthday, man it was gross! egg whites floating in it, souping, stringy.......anyway, so you think that is the pie you want, when all of a sudden you see the cherry pie. Man, that cherry pie looks good, but you have ""always loved"" the pumpkin pie, or at least you thought you might have. Not to mention there are all these people behind you saying, ""BEN, CHOOSE THE PUMPKIN!"" even the pumpkin is telling you to choose it. then you glance at the cherry, it looks really good. but if you choose the cherry you will be a stupid face that every time they think they know what they want they change their minds and all the people behind you and even the pumpkin pie will be dissapointed. but you see that cherry pie, it even looks better than the pumpkin, where's cooler clothes....i mean cherries, cooler cherries. that cherry pie is really sweet to, and would never make you look stupid in front of people for now reason, or for any reason at all. that cherry pie has been there for a while. it's not asking you to choose it, as a matter of fact, it's sitting in a dark corner of the glass case where no one but you see's it. so, yeah, that is how women are like pie. the end....."

I started with D&D, some know me as Ben, but in the world of Dungeons and Dragons I am....TIMPI THE GNOME WIZARD! Yeah, it's tight. I'm also making some tight new friends. The game is really interesting, sometimes odd, but interesting. The new friends are the same way. I thought all of them were like stuck up jerks, turns out, I'm wrong. So, I'm learning a new game, proving some ideas wrong, and making tight new friends. Not to mention new friends that are guys. How many guy friends do I have, oh yeah, that'd be Casey, and sometimes Jono, and Matt. Next stop Yu-Gi-Oh cards, not just a game for nine year olds. I'm learning from Maureen, who I realize I miss a lot. Like, I didn't see her much while dating Stef, but now that I do what I want, I can chill with her. Today we went to Z's and played Yu-Gi-Oh, while drinking a shake, tight. Oh, and then there's work. I worked with the new guy, Ken, for the first time the other day, and oh my lord, this kid is slow to the maz! Like, not just new slow, but crazy slow. I think he'll make it though, because I told him what he can do different. yet, while I'm worrying about these different things, guess what, oh yeah, the back room is flooding with mop water becasue I was so busy I forgot to turn it off! LAME! I cleaned it all up and told Kathy, all was well. All except for slow guy keeping me there until 9:45. so, yeah, now I'm a workaholic, who works everyday next week? oh, yeah, me!!!! LORD! Anywho, then there's the girl. It's really hard to tell whether I want to tell her because I want to or because everyone else wants me to. I mean, everyone expects me to tell her, so I feel like i need to. But when I think about it, right now, I'm happy. I don't need to tell her, I'm content with not telling her yet. I know it will get later and later, but we would be seperating anyway, so, if I do tell her, then it will be because I want to, not because everyone else is telling me I'm running out of time and so forth. Yeah, that's about it. Other then that I'm auditioning for singing at grad. CROSS YOUR FINGERS! I think me and Steph H. will make it hard core. I'm also trying for the speach thing too. It's gonna be tight. All in all, life is good."

"event","Yo yo yo, WASL this week and upcoming weeks rocks my world hardcore. I mean for real. Today I was going to try and weasel out of choir to go play D&D but my weasling skills need a little work if ya catch the drift. The guys even came to the choir room to try and steal me. I tried to escape, but it was no good. Ms. Hansen just started talking about Jackson's voice, and tried to recruit him for choir. But, yeah, tommorow I will play to the max. At lunch today I think I will try and confess the feelings, but mneh, who knows. School sucks but life goes on. And, I DON'T WORK TONIGHT! WOOOT! Yeah last night I found out what it would be like to have octuplets and decided that wasn't for me. Not to mention one of the kids kept like running into me in innappropriate areas if you catch the drift. I also have become addicted to One Tree Hill as of last night. Man, last night I was looking at my written journal which I hadn't written in since I broke with Stef. It was weird. I talked in it about how I was afraid of falling in love with someone else and how I thought that my feelings for stef were just me tricking myslef, there were also entries that said I was totally happy with stef. I don't know, just glad I got out of that. Well, it's back to choir to practice with Rachel. I miss Rachel and everyone, like Nico, Elisa, Kendra. COME ON GUYS! CHILLAGE!"

"event","Woah, life has been pretty tizzy. I lack sleep, but it's cool. Work is good, I now have a key so I can close alone. School is rockin', I'm keeping up. I asked Mary to senior ball, this makes me happy. And everything is at an all around high. Parents are leaving for the weekend so what does that mean? PARTY! Good times are going to be had by all. Today also commence the first day of training in the D&D. The guys are cool too, so it's tight. I soon will be confessing my feelings, so that's tight. And I've decided to risk it all and pursue performance theatre at the university I choose (Berkeley, cross your fingers). So now I'm going to be poor! IT'S TIGHT!"

"event","Yeah, today was hyper lame to the max. It all begins with that God awful buzzing noise. Oh, right, jazz choir, AT 6:30! WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I SLEPT?! Oh, yeah, I can't remember. Then school was lame. Realized that I need to actually start doing work, or my grades will hardcore plummet. Man, what is with taking hard classes, for reals. Then for some weird reason I go into this temporary depression. Did I know why? NO! Lameness. And I still haven't gotten my letters from stefanie. I did my part, she has the poster. For cripes sake. Then I go to the Planned Parenthood in Monroe with a friend. Still depressed until I enter Monroe, and for some reason it all goes away. That was super tight. I enter the building and realize that all these girls are looking at me and what do I realize? They all think I'm having sex with the girl I'm with. I guess it's no big deal. It was just funny. Then I realize I'm freaking hungry, so we go to Taco Bell. The rest of the day was depression free. Super tight. Then I do some homework and dread 6:30, but a phone call. I don't have to go to work! WOOT! So I continue happily. Eating dinner and then get another call. HURRY BEN! WE NEED YOU AT WORK! I put down my pork chop and run out the door. Work, yeah, this girl wouldn't stop hitting people, nuff said. Sleep...."

"event","Yeah, word, life goes by so incredibly quickly. I mean, for reals, only two more months until graduation. This is not so cool. I'm hit with the sudden realization that I will not see like millions of people ever again once i graduate. Doesn't help that I'm moving to Cali. Thus, decision time comes in. Do we play upon that whole ""it is better to have loved and lost"" buisness and confess everything to everyone in hopes of two months of greatness, or do we continue in our comforts? Also, gotta decide where to go to school after I complete my community college. Do I work really hard and try to get to Berkeley to major in who knows what, or do I diddle daddle around trying to decide what to do with the rest of my life. No one knows. Well, here's what I've decided. I'm going for the two months of greatness and I'm going for Berkeley. Now that I think about it, I think it will be ""hella tight."" Okay, so it's decided, I'm going to make the best of it. Tizzy."

"event","This week went by so freakin slow.  I'm really glad it's over and that it's Saturday.  I needed a break from this past week.  It's been so crazy.

I went to see the school musical ""Grease"" last night.  Oh my god!  Best school play I've ever seen!!  Evan was such a great Danny Zuko.  It was so great seeing him sing and dance.  And Isaac!!  Oh my goodness!  I never ever knew he could sing like that!!  Whitney was so good as Sandy.  If I could see it again, I totally would.  It is so awesome!  If you havent seen it or don't plan on seeing it, you are deprived of good, quality LHS entertainment :p

I can finally go back to playing AAU with my girls.  I can't wait to get back into it.  I havent seen them since the tournament cause I've had 2 proms in a row.

Speaking of prom, we had ours last saturday.  It was a good time.  Bopha got QUEEN!!!  I'm glad she got it.  She deserves it.  But it was fun.  A little unorganized and the food was kinda shitty, but the dancing was fun!  Haha not even 5 minutes into dancing my dress broke!  My spaghetti strap snapped and Laura and I were freaking out.  So we went to find Mrs. Calvarese and thank god she had safety pins.  And Robbie and I taught half the kids there how to do the Cotton-Eyed Joe dance.  Haha it was awesome!

After AAU tonight, I'm going to see Star Wars with my dad and Robbie..for free!!  Hahahaha yessss I got free movie passes!  It's going to be so good."

Well, lets see, nothing to exciting is happening in life right now.  Prom is 2 days away!!  I cant wait! :)  It's going to be a fun weekend.  Robbie's got bball on Sunday, so I think I'm going to go watch him play, which is going to be so awesome ;)

I got my first recruiting letter!!  From Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont.  It looks really interesting for a few reasons.  1. It's in the middle of Vermont; 2. It's kind of a military school; 3. Their girls basketball team, in the last 4 years, has had a record of 86-29, gone to the National Tournament, and competed in championships of the ECAC tournament.  And they want me!! :)  I'm really excited!  haha

School is winding down.  Only a few weeks left until I'm officially a senior!  It's really scary, but fun at the same time.  I'm going to visit Simmons College and Lasell College in Massachusetts in June.  I still have to contact like, 6 other schools to go and visit.  And we still need to hear from Hamilton College, who is also interested in me for their basketball program.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens after July 1, because that's when colleges can start contacting me about basketball.  I know at least 4 colleges that are going to send me stuff.

Everything is happening so fast!


Bopha and I are the happiest girls in the world!!! ;)"

My mom ordered Robbie's bouteneres (I have no idea how to spell it) and I went to Second Star Bridal and got a white, silk shawl, which is really pretty!  Then we went to Sterling Works and got a necklace that's a silver heart.  We must have spent like, 20 minutes in there.  We stopped into All That Jazz to get a clip for my hair, cause I'm not going to put it up.  Then we went to get my garder at Hallmark...of all places to get one, I got it at Hallmark :p  Anyway!  After that, we went over to Bope's and picked up my dress because she altered it for me.. It fits so much better!  I love Bopha's mom!  She's so awesome!

"event","Okay, there's been a lot of hype over who should be the NBA MVP this year.  Many people are moving towards Steve Nash (which would be so totally super awesome cause Steve Nash is the man!) because of his contributions to the Phoenix Suns.  However, others are saying that he shouldn't be or is unlikely because other players do more for their teams, like Shaq and Allen Iverson and those guys...read this article to know more about it 

http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/3543238?GT1=6428

Personally, I do not agree with this...sure other players get more steals and blocks than Nash and may score more points...but Steve Nash has the strong ability to dictate the flow of the game and lead his team to victory.  Being able to control the game and lead the team from a losing season to the best record in the entire league is what makes you MVP.


But that's what I think"

I'm going to work out with Tony this week 3 times.  Monday, Thursday, and Friday at 4:15ish.  It should be fun.  Gonna go with my man Robbie tomorrow and chill.  We wanna go bowling haha.  I suck at bowling... but that's beside the point haha.  I can't wait to work out with Tony.  It's been too long.  I think he's going to tell me a little bit more of the New Hampton Camp this summer.

I'm also going to visit Russell Sage College in Troy, NY.  I really want to go to this school, cause they have a major physical therapy and athletic training program and I have a really good chance at playing basketball there too.  I'm going to visit Wednesday, so I can find out more about it.

I went to the common to play basketball and ended up playing with a bunch of guys from my school - Sam, Dylan, Billy, Tom, Mike Coffield, and then Dan Currier and Jason Shosa.  We played 4 on 4 with me, Sam, Dylan and Billy on a team.  We were getting tooled on by Dan and Jason, but we were doing good.  At one point they had the ball and I was playin defense, then all of a sudden I got hit in the head by the ball by Tom.  Holy shit that hurt... it hurt so bad that I had to leave, right in the middle of the game.  I've had a headache all afternoon and I don't like it at all right now...

2 days left until vacation :)  I'm going to go visit Russell Sage College next week, and I'm also going to work with Tony sometime which will be really good.  Got my AAU schedule too, 6 tournaments.  First one is April 30 and May 1 at Lyndon State.  It's going to be awesome."

Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you don't let show

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me

So just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on



It's been stuck in my head since we heard it in the car :p"

[02] I will then tell you what song/BAND reminds me of you.

[03] Next, I will tell you who you remind me of, celebrity/animated or otherwise.

[04] Last, I will try to name a single word that best describes you.

[05] Put this in your journal

I can't wait for Friday!!  I'm so excited to play against the Street Ball team :)  And I found out today that I don't have AAU practice the next day, which is nice.  My mom wants me to go to the clinic the street ball guys are putting on.  I don't know if I'm going to go yet.. we'll see how I feel.. ;)

I got Class M All-State Honorable Mention!  I was so happy when I found out.  Robbie told me at like, 9 o clock last night and I was like ""...REALLY!""  haha I don't think he even knew that I didn't know about it.  I was so excited though.  I told my dad and he went out and got the paper, and he had to drive around town to find a place that was open.  It was so funny.  It's cool cause Charlie got 2nd team and Cavan got Honorable Mention too.

Hmm.. not much else to say..

Go Michigan State!"

"event","I love those days where you have nothing to do, so you just do whatever you think of off the top of your head.. like what Laura and I did today after school.  She didn't have softball, so we went and got the car from my mom and headed to Walmart.  She needed to find something (which she couldnt) and I bought the new Lifehouse cd (which is very good by the way.. I'm listening to it right now).  We headed to Staples to find the thumb drive she was looking for and it took us like, 20 minutes to find it.  Then we headed to Bobbo's to give him his sweatshirt and we invited him to go get food and go to Laura's for some pool action.  He had just made popcorn for himself, but he brought it with him with some heavy thought...

Me: Come on Bobbo, you know you want to come with us..
Bobbo:  I know...
Me: Come on..popcorn..or chicken..
Laura: POPCORN CHICKEN!!

hahaha soo good.

So we got chicken and some dew and headed to Laura's.  Laura and Bobbo were gonna play the first game while I proceeded to eat my chicken and fries.  Bobbo started setting the billiards up without using a rack.  Laura then said the comment we would make fun of the entire afternoon..

Laura: Bobbo you dont need to do that.. I have a rack.

That was the funniest thing I've ever heard her say.  It was so funny.. and it was even better she went along with us the entire afternoon.

Oh man.. it was such a fun afternoon :)"

"event","This has probably been the best weekend for me in a long time.

First off, I had AAU on Saturday from 2-4.  It was a lot of fun, especially getting to see everybody I haven't seen since either this season or last AAU season.  It was good.  Kristen had a good time (like I thought she would).

After that, I went to see Robbie!  I was so happy.  3 weeks is just too long without seeing each other.  We went to Mitch's Restaurant with Mitch and Jake.  That was fun, then Robbie and I went to see Robots.  That movie was so awesome!  I loved it.  Robin Williams was so great. (I definitely recommend it).  I spent the night at his house and he brought me home this morning around 10.  I had so much fun, I didn't want him to leave.  Hopefully I'll get to see him next weekend again :)

This afternoon was intense... I tried out for a bball team to play against the And 1 Mixtape Tour.  Oh my gosh... it was so awesome and scary at the same time because 1. I was the only girl and 2. I was really sore from AAU.  There was this guy there that must have been at least 6'6"".  He stuffed me so many times.  He didn't even have to move.. it was so much fun though.  I held my own against them.  I had a lot of assists, and at least 6 points.  It was awesome.  I hope I made the team.  The game is on April 1 at 7:00 in Lyndonville at LSC.  Be there!

4 day weekend!  Woooo!

UVM lost :(

Duke won :)"

I've been waiting for this to start since it ended last year haha.  I can't wait!

And I get to see Robbie today too!  I'm going to his house for the night afterwards.  This is the first time we've seen each other in 3 weeks.  I'm so excited! haha.

Then tomorrow I have tryouts for the streetball thing in Lydnonville.  That's going to be so fun!  I found out I'm the only girl trying out.. that makes me nervous haha.  But it's awesome cause I heard the team is playing against the And 1 Mixtape tour!  Oh my gosh...

1. We got off the Titanic first.

5. No fashion faux pas we make, could ever rival the Speedo. 

6. We don't have to pass gas to amuse ourselves. 

7. If we forget to shave, no one has to know. 

8. We can congratulate our teammate without ever touching her rear end. 

9. We never have to reach down every so often to make sure our privates are still there. 

10. We have the ability to dress ourselves. 

11. We can talk to the opposite sex without having to picture them naked. 

12. If we marry someone 20 years younger, we are aware that we will look like an idiot. 

13. We will never regret piercing our ears.

But she also said that they aren't giving me financial aid to go there...

And I had finally made my decision that I was probablay going to go there if they gave me money...

Maybe it's just not meant to be :("

The day we met
The time we got to know each other

The hot tub in 110 degree weather
Our first kiss
Watching your basketball games
The game you scored 30 points - 10 three's
The car rides home
The first time you came to my house
The time when you met my family
Falling off the playground thing at the park

Going on your boat
Playing poker for the first time
My first high school football game
The time I almost beat you 1 on 1
Our first Christmas
Our first dance
Our first Valentine's day

Looking at the stars
Turning all the toys on in the stores
Cooking grilled cheese

"event","It's the last day of vacation, and how am I going to spend it?

At home, cleaning and reading.  Not exactly how I would want to, but I guess there's a difference between ""want to"" and ""need to.""  I have to read the last 3 or 4 chapters for The Odyssey for English and clean the house because my mom comes home from Florida tomorrow.  So I need to do dishes, another 100 loads of laundry, and vacuum.  I have to do it all by myself because my dad was too lazy to do anything yesterday when I wasnt home.  But, it needs to be done..don't really want to do it, but I have no choice.

All in all, the vacation is what I needed.  Didn't do a whole lot of anything.  I went down to watch Belmont play their quarter- and semi-final games in Plymouth.  They lost in the semis, which really sucks, but they still played good.

Got together with Bope, Laura, Peter, Ryan, Bobbo and Jason at the beginning of the week.  We watched Anchorman, which Laura and Ryan saw for the first time.  Then we played Cranium, me and Laura vs. Bope and Bobbo.  It took 2 and a half hours to finish the game.  Laura and I won haha.  But I had to do a shirade where I had to show the tv show ""The Naked Chef.""  I think you can guess how that went.. After that we watched like, 4 or 5 shows of Whose Line is it Anyway.  It was so funny. :p

I got together with Robbie a few times too.  But he had school this past week, and I only got to see him for a little bit each time.  He met up with us when we went to see Belmont play in their Semi game, and my dad and I went to see him play in his last home game on Thursday.  They lost, but it was still a good game.  I went down to spend the day with him yesterday.  We chilled for most of it and went out to dinner with his parents.  Then we came back and went to play basketball.  He kicked my ass so bad.  I had to stop halfway through our second game cause my ankle was hurting.  But it was still a good time :)

Tomorrow is going to be a busy day for me.  After school, I have my last basketball meeting of the season.  We're turning in our uniforms and voting for MVP.  Then I'm going to see Mr. Humphreys to work on the yearbook.  At night, I have a National Honor Society meeting where we're going to have some fun with the new inductees.  Should be fun..."

I've been waiting to hear from The New Hampton School to find out if I have been accepted to their school.  I've been guessing (since applications were due at the beginning of February) that the acceptance letters are due out sometime soon.  So I'm sitting at home, and the mail comes.  I start sorting through it, like I normally do.  I see a letter from New Hampton addressed to my parents.  At this point, I really want to know what's in it, but can't open it cause its addressed to my mom and dad, and my mom isn't home.  I call my dad at work to see if I can open it.  He says yes, as long as I read the letter to him.  I open it and start reading it aloud.  Reading the first half of the sentence, I'm overjoyed.. it says:

""First of all, please pass along my congratulations to Cassandra...""

I'm so excited, and so is my dad, but then I read the rest of the sentence..

""...for finishing her application.""

You can hear the tone in my voice change from super-excited to really disappointed.  Then it says decisions will be mailed March 10th.  And the rest of the letter was about the newsletter enclosed talking about the new headmaster.

Like I said, talk about shafted..."

Plus, everybody on our team was sick, including me, and I had an ankle injury.  And it was a 2 and a half hour trip.  Thursday was not a fun day at all for me.

I'm sick, and I hate being sick.  I have a sore throat and a stuffy nose.  I don't like the kind of colds where you feel like you are never going to get better, like the one I have now.  I stayed home from school yesterday and today, and I'm going to have a shitload of work to make up.  I missed a lab in chemistry, but that's not a big deal.  I think it's just english I really have to worry about.  I gave my cold to Robbie, and now he's sick, and I feel really bad..he says it's okay and not a big deal..stupid illness..

The regualar basketball season is over..we have playoffs now on Thursday..in fucking Epping..down by UNH.  Oh well, at least it isnt Mascoma or Conant.  If we win that game (which would be totally awesome cause Epping is 16-2) we're going to Plymouth State!!!  That would rockkk.  But our regular season ended on Friday.  We lost to the Regional 44-40.  It really sucked.  I rolled my ankle really bad in the 2nd quarter and couldn't go back in for the rest of the game.  I was doing really good too!  I had 6 points, second highest scorer, and I wasn't even in 14 minutes.  I saw Alex and Peyton (Mike Curtis' daughters - he's the Regional's coach) after the game.  They gave me papers that they drew on saying Go Cassie and stuff like that.  It was so cute.  It made me feel a lot better.  Mike Curtis is really cool.  He gave me a hug at the game and wished me luck in the future if I go to the New Hampton School.

Closing out the regular season, I had 319 points.  For a total in my high school career, I have 618 points.  Everybody thinks I'm going to get my 1000 next year.  That would be nice, but if I don't get it, it's not a big deal.

I went to Robbie's this weekend.  We couldn't go to his dance because..well, I really couldn't, because of my stupid ankle.  But we just hung out for the day and I brought him his Valentine gifts.  He really liked them haha.  He got me a rose and a little teddy bear :) We hung out and went and saw Hitch.  It was soo good!  I spent the night and we went to Concord the next day and saw a bball game at NHTI vs. CMCC (Central Maine).  It was a really good game.  NHTI won.

And there is the much-needed update. ;)"

"event","ugh I want this week to end!  It seems like it's been forever since Sunday.  I only have 1 game this week, and it was supposed to be today against the Regional, but we had to get a huge snowstorm and get it postponed until tomorrow.  That doesn't bug me so much, but I really wanted to play tonight!  This week has just lasted a long time.  I got to go see Robbie on Tuesday cause I went down to see him play, but he only played like, 10 minutes of the whole game.. he was really bummed afterwards, but I managed to cheer him up a little before I left.  But we need to win our next game to get a good spot in playoffs.. we need to have our head in the game.  Mr. B kicked us out of practice 15 minutes early yesterday cause everybody was goofing around and not taking stuff seriously.  We need to play well.  Everybody wants to get to Plymouth, and we can do it, if we just keep our heads in the game, and everybody plays like a team..

We are doing the nastiest lab in Chemistry.  It's a water-purification lab, and we took this really nasty water, full of dirt and oil and ugh.. doing the first part of it today almost made me sick.  The sample we had smelled like garlic and oil and when we poured the sample into the cylinder you could see every little particle moving around.  It was disgusting.  I gagged so many times just cause it smelled horrible.  And we get to finish it tomorrow.  Hoooray.. that class is fun though.. that and English, even though it's a hard class.  I detest Global.  It totally sucks.  We don't do anything!  We're doing a postcard project about a place we've visited.  It has nothing to do with history.. nothing!

I can't wait for Saturday.  I'm going to Robbie's for the day and then we're going to his Semi dance.  I'm going to stay at his house cause it's just too far to drive to bring me home at 10 o clock at night.  We're going to go in his hot tubbbb!!! :D  haha last time we went in his hot tub in the summer it was 110 degrees out.  This time, it'll be like, 40.  It's goine to be awesomeeeeee! :)"

"event","Last night was the long anticipated Winter Carnival dance.  It was so much fun!  Robbie came up for some of the day then Laura and Pete came over before the dance and we ate and got ready and such.  Laura looked so pretty!  We had many pictures taken of us haha.  Then we headed to the dance at 7:30.  It was a good time.  The theme was Las Vegas so they had card tables out and we played Blackjack and Texas Hold Em.  Good times.  Then we danced for the rest of the night.  It was such a great time.  Robbie had a good time too, and he doesn't usually go to dances, and I'm really glad he had fun :)  I thought he was going to get into a fight with DJ, cause he came up to Robbie and was like ""If you break her heart I'll break your legs!""  I think Robbie got kind of mad..but he got over it ;) haha.  The dance went by way too fast though.  Before we knew it it was time to leave.  The four of us went back to my house, and Laura was going to spend the night, but she called her mom and she said no, and that her grandfather wanted to see her in her dress.  Laura was so mad, cause 1. she had already changed, and 2. she wanted to stay at my house.  So Laura and Peter left and me and Robbie went to get food at 11.  Then he slept over again.  Went to breakfast this morning and hung out until he had to leave at 11.  I didn't want him to leave, but he had to get home, so we said our goodbyes.  I'm going to his game on Tuesday, so I can finally see him play.  Then I'm going to his semi-formal next week.  So I'm going to stay down at his place..should be fun ;)  


I started reading The Odyssey for English class.  I read Book 1 tonight.  I thought it was going to be a really hard book to read and to understand, but it's really not.  It's pretty easy, and it's good too!  haha.  Usually Mrs. Hennessy's books arent too good."

Had a game last night against the Regional.  We won! 48-44.  such a gooooood game.  I had 22 points and 13 rebounds.  I got to see Mike Curtis (the Regional Girls Varsity Coach) and his little girls Alex and Peyton, who I coached at camp this summer.  They're so cute.  Alex gave me a picture from camp and standing next to the 2 girls, I look like a giant!  haha.  It was so nice to see them.  They came up to me after the game and gave me a huge hug.  I love seeing those girls..

I have 4 games left...it's unbelievable.  This season just flew by...I can't believe.  We're playing Mascoma again tomorrow..that's one thing I'm not looking forward to, because we lost to them on Monday by 49 points...it was not fun..

Big U.S. History final tomorrow...and I cannot study anymore.  I have the worst headache in the world.  Thank goodness tomorrow's my last day in that class.."

"event","Soo much to talk about...

I'm really sick of the bullshit that's going on on the basketball team this year.  There is so much drama, it's not fun anymore.  Everybody is trying to be better than everybody else and people want to be the center of attention and the ""star"" of the team - they pass it to only one of the girls that can really score and not to the others that can do it just as well, if not, better.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  There is no team comaraderie, girls don't like each other, some try to run the team when it isn't their job.  We aren't a team, and it's not fun.  I cannot wait for AAU to play with the girls from Belmont.  Speaking of Belmont, we played them on Wednseday.  It was probably the most fun I've had this season.  Just seeing them and talking to them for most of the JV game was great.  I would love to play on Mr. Blair's team.  I have more fun with them than anybody else.  I have more friends on another team than I do on my own team...but playing them was so much fun.

Winter Carnival is coming up in two weeks.  This is one of the best times of the school year.  I got signed up for three events this year haha.  I'm in Foul Shooting, Air Band, and The Quack Game.  That's going to be fun!  Our class mascot is the Road Runner, so we have to find our teammates using the ""meep meep"" sound.  It's going to be outrageous.  And the WC Dance is coming up too.  I love the dance.  It's so much fun.  Haha last year the fire alarm went off during the last song.  Good times.  Robbie's coming to it with me :)  I'm going to teach him how to dance haha ;)  It's going to be fun.

I went out to breakfast with all the girls this morning.  It was so great.  We packed ourselves (all seven of us) into one little corner of the diner, and we were all just chit chatting about stuff that's been happening this year, latest gossip and stuff like that cause we dont all get to see each other during the day anymore.  It was cool.  Then I went to see Robbie today.  We hung out, watched The Musketeer and just chilled, like we always do haha.  There's a major snow storm, so they brought me home early.  I wish we werent almost 50 miles apart and that I could see him everyday.  We always have so much fun when we're together.. I love spending time with him.."

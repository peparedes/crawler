"event","I heard about this little 4 year old girl who has stage 4 neuroblastoma from a friend a couple of months back. Her story was even more compelling to me because her mother is a single mother who is trying very hard to save her daughter's life. And turns out, her father's a heartless dick. You can read more about her story at <a href=""http://ourfeistyprincess.com/index.php"">Our Fiesty Princess</a> and at her <a href=""http://ourfeistyprincess.blogspot.com/"">blog</a>.

I've been following the progress of the little girl's journey through her blog for quite a while. And I'm truly and truly amazed at how things have progressed and how helpful and generous Singaporeans have been. I think initially she just had the blog and some people donated through the blog but they weren't making much progress towards the S$5 million they were trying to raise. 

And then the media found out about her and since then I think it's really grown into this huge huge fundraising drive. People started donating and selling things on forums to raise money, people who ran businesses online started donating part of their proceeds to her, members of Hardwarezone forum also started collecting money for her with even one anonymous person saying that he/she would match $1 to $1 donations up to S$10k and someone even organised a photo shoot for people's pets to raise money. 

Truly truly amazing..I never thought I'd see anything like this...Singaporeans really got up and started helping and not just by giving money but some people really went out of their way and started mini fundraising events on their own. People talk about how Singaporeans are not gracious and we're all kind of selfish...and you know I always kind of agreed. I always thought everyone was just going about their own lives and doing their own thing and not really bothering about the community around them, the people around them and everyone just better not get in their way. 

But look at how wrong I've been! This has grown into something which I think Charmaine's mother and friends didn't even imagine. I didn't imagine this could happen when I first started following her blog and sharing the link on my facebook and with my friends. There was a celebrity soccer match with the Dream Team of Singapore from Malaysia Cup days (Fandhi Ahmad, Nazri Nasir, Abbas Saad!!), there is now a sort of advertisement of her site calling for help for her by Jamie Ong, Oli Pettigrew and Eunice Olsen on AXN, and just today I saw that there is going to be <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LpYDiN2-LcY/SmNbTQBOr-I/AAAAAAAAAOQ/e1BAtZITFEs/s1600-h/eposter2.jpg"">an event at Zouk</a> (sponsored by Zouk and many others) for Charmaine! 

I can't even begin to describe how amazed and fascinated I am by how things have turned out. I'm also really happy for Charmaine and her family. Because this must be so great to have so many people care and so many people wanting to help in their time of despair and hardship. It must be so overwhelming...Charmaine's mother is one strong strong person to be handling all this. 

I know I've said this already and used this word several times but..I am really really amazed...and also really proud of my fellow Singaporeans (as cheesy as that sounds)! 

Stay strong and fight on Charmaine and family! So many people are behind you and rooting for you!

(i) Episode 2 - Melissa and Ade doing a Sonya Tayeh Jazz routine to &quot;24 Hours (The Ashton Shuffle A-Bomb Remix)&quot; by Terry Poison; 

(ii) Episode 10 - Evan and Randi doing a Mia Michaels Contemporary routine to &quot;Koop Island Blues&quot; by Koop feat. Ane Brun; 

(iii) Episode 14 - Kayla and Kupono doing a Mia Michaels Contemporary routine to &quot;Gravity&quot; by Sara Bareilles; 

(iv) Episode 14 - Brandon and Janette doing an Argentine Tango by Miriam Larici and Leonardo Barrionuevo to &quot;Libertango&quot; from Forever Tango (the original Broadway cast); 

(v) Episode 14 - Janette and Brandon doing a Wade Robson Jazz routine to &quot;Ruby Blue&quot; by Roisin Murphy. 

The Janette/Brandon Argentine Tango was AMAZING&nbsp;AMAZING&nbsp;AMAZING...so so so good. The Kayla/Kupono Mia Michaels Contemporary routine gave me chills and at one point I almost teared a little!! And Wade Robson is just such an excellent choreographer..I really like Sonya Tayeh and Mia Michaels too..

I like the dances in Season 5 more than I like any particular danceRs..unlike Season 4 where I just loved loved LOVE Joshua and Katiee (and also&nbsp;Twitch but to a less degree). So many more dances from them that I love watching over and over again than in the current season...

Sigh..so..yeah..i wish i could dance!!"

The food was really yummy, we got D to dance for us (which was hilarious!) and we saw<lj user=""luminosita"">&nbsp; and <lj user=""bubblensqueak"">'s amazing ability to chug beer. <br /><br />Then on the 21st i had brunch at Braise with L and S. The brunch menu at Braise was goooood..I was so stuffed. You get to share around 7 appetizers with your table, pick 1 egg dish, 1 main course and a dessert. And you can also choose a free flow sangria menu! <br /><br />After that I had dinner with the family at Shunjuu. So it's really been a weekend of overeating. <br /><br />Here's a rundown of the FABULOUS presents I got this year: <br /><br />1) Red Christian Louboutins pumps from Baby (my first ever CLs!!) <br /><br />2) Sex and the City Seasons 1 - 6 box set that came in this gorgeous pink velvet cover (I have wanted this for a VERY long time) <br /><br />3) Sex and the City movie DVD (Chris Noh is so hot) <br /><br />4)&nbsp;Dark Knight DVD (Christian Bale is so hot) <br /><br />5) A pink and gold velvet leopard print clutch (kind of hooker which is completely awesome) <br /><br />6) Hello Kitty mahjong tiles (even has a special LV damier inspired box!!!) <br /><br />YAY!! I felt super super loved this year and I was really really happy over the weekend. It was just so nice on the 19th when so many people were sending me birthday smses and messages on Facebook..*beam* It was really nice. <br /><br />I did have a slight panic attack at one point on the morning of the 19th when I realised I am now on the wrong side of 25. Depressing....but it's ok..i have found the solution to it. The most powerful thing in the whole wide world..Denial. <br /><br />I decided I turned 25 (again) this year. So...can't wait for my next 25th birthday!! Wheeee...<br /><br />"

And I didn't buy that visor, my mother did. </strong></em><br /><br />I thought we did a pretty good job considering this was our first time on the course. 3 of us finished in slightly less than 2 hours although that might be due to our instructor rushing us along and not letting us putt our balls into the hole once we got our balls closer to the hole and kept going &quot;ok gimme gimme. pick up your ball&quot;. But we didn't lose too many balls and I didn't dig too many holes in the ground and I think that's good!!&nbsp;<br /><br /> But today also made me realise what a mafan affair it is to play golf! You need the clubs, the club covers, the shoes, the gloves, the cap, the sunglasses, the different height tees, the balls, a cloth to clean the balls and clubs, the markers, the sun block, the score cards, the pencils...the list just goes on and on. Baby and me squeezed about 12 clubs (6 each) into one small bag and we had such a hard time getting the clubs in and out of the bag and trying to juggle the extra balls and tees and the score cards!! It was so stressful coz we were also being rushed along by our instructor and there was a flight behind us!&nbsp;We need to get better equipped and better organised the next time we play man...<br /><br />Kinda looking forward to playing again! <br />"

And all I was really aiming for was to hit the bloody little white round bugger cleanly. I wouldn't even have minded if it didn't fly that far! It's terribly demoralising...I wonder if it's against some golf etiquette if I start cursing on the course. 

I am looking forward to getting all the cute pink golf accessories I can find. That is my only motivation for carrying on with this game. I am also very tempted to bling out my current golf shoes. Cos if I'm gonna suck at the game, the least I can do is look cute (and completely frivolous) doing it!! And also have pretty shiny things to distract me and hopefully prevent me from pounding the ground with my golf club or throwing it across the green."

The timing of Nadal's rise to No. 1 depends on his results in Cincinnati:<br /><br />- If Nadal wins the title, he will become No. 1 this Monday. <br />- If Nadal loses in the final he will become No. 1 on August 11 <br />- If Nadal loses in the semifinals he will become No. 1 on August 18<br /><br />Federer has held the top ranking a record 235 consecutive weeks (since Feb. 2, 2004) and Nadal has been No. 2 for a record 158 straight weeks (since July 25, 2005). The last player to rank No. 1 before Federer's reign was Andy Roddick the week of Jan. 26, 2004.<br /><br />The Spaniard will become the 24th player in the history of the South African Airways ATP Rankings (since 1973) to hold the No. 1 position. He will join countrymen Carlos Moya (1999) and Juan Carlos Ferrero (2003) to rank No. 1.<br /><br />Nadal, who also won his career-best 32nd consecutive match on Friday, has reached the semifinals or better in all nine ATP Masters Series tournaments in his career. He will attempt to become the first player to reach the final in all nine when he plays World No. 3 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals on Saturday. Nadal leads the all-time series 9-3, winning the last three meetings this year.</i><br /><br /><b>VAMOS RAFA!!! </b>"

"event","After much agonising (mainly due to our shock at how much a wedding costs and a desire to be sensible people), we have confirmed 3 of the 5 biggest wedding decisions we have to make. Let me say first that I don't necessarily think we finally managed to be sensible people (and I think I might be the one to blame). <br /><br />We have fixed a date. 12 and 13 December 2009. People write it down. I tell you a year and a half in advance so no excuses for missing it. <br /><br />We have booked our banquet venue. It will be a lunch banquet at Conrad International Centennial Hotel. <br /><br />We have booked our main photographers. <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1217388936435*/"">Oneeyeclick&nbsp;</a> for our pre-wedding shots and <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1217388956237*/"">William Chua</a> for our actual day shots.&nbsp; <br /><br />The remaining 2 decisions are the solemnisation venue and our bridal package. We've pretty much decided that solemnisation will be at our church and our bridal package will be with Frederick Lee (whose assistance remembers me because I brought the, and I quote, ""goooooreeeeous husband""). We just need to get down to confirming these. <br /><br />There are of course still a TON of things that need to be done like deciding on where we're going to have our friend's dinner, a videographer (if any), a photographer for the banquet lunch (because we can't afford to get William on both days), how I am going to squeeze Bestest Friend into a baby pink suit etc etc etc. But we feel good that we've got these big things out of the way. Now we're just really looking forward to the house TOP-ing and starting on the renovations and stuff."

She's grown so much in the last year and she's changed so much..she's running now and it's amazing watching her learn and discover things. 
I bought her a little Baby Disney Princess car that has all sorts of buttons that make noises and plays music. 

I'm exhausted though...last I saw Sarah she was still going strong and having fun with her pressies.."

"event","golf so far. 

Right now..I am thinking I hate it. 

I had my first lesson on the recent Sunday and Baby wanted to go to the driving range today after work. So we went. 

I don't get this game! Baby kept giving me all these instructions...go forward abit..go backward abit..don't open your feet so wide..don't hunch (altho I caught him hunching too!!)..lean forward..your arms are too straight (but the coach said STRAIGHT!!). 

And then I couldn't figure out of I was using strength or not because I didn't feel like I was and I certainly wasn't trying to but everytime I missed the ball or hit it badly I would grunt which was a sign I must have used strength. 

I just don't get it....it seems like it is a game with very specific technique and yet it is not possible to very precisely determine how straight my damn arms are supposed to be or exactly how far away from the ball I am supposed to be!! 

And this does not sit well with me...if you tell me my arms are supposed to be straight..don't tell me ""not so straight"". There is no such thing as ""not so straight""!! Either it is straight or it is not! 

You know I am quite happy to be the lady in the big hat and sunglasses sitting in the country club cafe having tea and flipping through Harper's Bazaar while my husband is out there in the sun hitting a tiny ball around with a long thin stick. 

Instead I am going to be the one smashing my own long thin stick to bits out in the big green field while screaming bloody murder. The only thing I am really looking forward to right now are those pink golf balls I saw in the shop the other day."

"event","It is about half an hour to the end of my last day of unemployment. 

I feel really bummed and nervous about starting work again after such a long break. I am totally not excited man. 

I didn't do some stuff which I think I should probably have done in my 3 months break. I didn't really think about trying out another industry, I didn't join some dance or language class to have something to show for my 3 months break, I didn't go into JB to see my grandma, I didn't really do anything which helped anyone...3 months just flew by so fast! It doesn't even feel like it's been that long...

Here's what I did do these 3 months: 

1. Went to HK with parents; 

2. Went for yoga classes at least once a week (except for the 2 weeks I was in Europe and the 2 weeks when I got back and was feeling tremendously lazy); 

3. Went to Europe with Baby; 

4. Attempted many times to pack my room. 

5. Went to HK with parents, big bro, sis-in-law and Sarah (my niece); 

6. Spent time playing with Sarah; 

7. Did a bunch of wedding related stuff (I am not insane ok); 

8. Finished reading 10 books; 

9. Finished watching all 10 seasons of F.R.I.E.N.D.S; 

10. Met up/hung out with my friends; 

11. Cooked dinner 4 times; 

12. Got a job. 

 So I've done my nails, packed my bag, hung out my clothes for tomorrow and laid out my accessories and make up. So I guess I'm ready for work tomorrow?"

"event","For some reason that I now cannot remember I suddenly thought of watching the video of Absolut Rouge, the dance production TH Dance did at Zouk when I was dance head.

I cringed when I saw myself in those $10 budget self made costumes I had on and when I saw myself dancing (I looked awful) and laughed when I heard the few comments made by the audience&nbsp; which the camera managed to pick up. But most of all I was amazed that we managed to pull the whole thing off.&nbsp; 

I of course can't remember now exactly how much work was involved although I think there really was quite abit. We were a committee of about 40 NUS students with more than half who were joining a dance committee for the first time. We did as many external performances as we could to raise funds, we had a marketing team who managed to get hair and make-up sponsorship and if I remember correctly a little bit of cash sponsorship (which required the entire committee's efforts to collect contacts for the insurance company), we had a fairly big (well big considering we were such a small committee) marketing campaign within the hall and around NUS, we produced a dance show at Zouk with a storyline with 10 dances and everyone in the committee performed. And at the end of the year, we had covered all expenses including the Zouk booking fee, costumes and props and we had money to spare! 

It was a simply storyline of bad boy and good girl get engaged, boy goes to club and hooks up with bad girl, good girl goes to club and sees them together and is heartbroken, good girl decides to be bad too and goes to club to confront bad girl, cat fight happens and just before bad girl slaps good girl boy steps in, bad girl slaps boy and goes off in a huff, bad boy begs for good girl's forgiveness which after some grovelling by him she gives. 

I could hear the audience laughing, gasping when good girl sees boy and bad girl together, going ""Orrrhhhhhh"" when good girl appears to confront bag girl and cheering when boy gets slapped by bad girl. I remember one of my committee members telling me that someone overhead some people in the toilet during the interval complaining about how the bad boy could cheat on good girl. That the audience was drawn into the storyline and the whole show was everything that I had hoped for and so much more than I could have asked for. 

I forgot how wonderful it was that the show was a success but watching the video again and thinking back, I think we were insane to have even attempted it and I'm so amazed and proud that we did it. No wonder my grades were so shit that year but so worth it. 

I feel so much prouder of the person I was back then than I have been of myself the last 2 years. Ahhh...to be young, determined and adventurous again.."

9pm - Watched Indiana Jones (I thought it was alright altho Baby, who is a fan of the series, was disappointed. Don't go in with huge expectations man...it's a 65 year old Harrison Ford) 

We finished the movie, came home, I watched 3 episodes of Friends and fell asleep dreaming of people locking me up because they thought I was crazy and force feeding me medication. Andy you visited me and tried to get me out...good friend!! 

I know the day doesn't sound like much and I even wondered what I managed to accomplish but it felt like a VERY full day!! How did I ever manage to do all the things I had to do AND work at the same time?? No wonder I was exhausted and cranky. 

Preparing for another interview tomorrow now. Two interviews in one week...super sianz."

Quick update on the trip so far. We are safe and sound. I have been sick though and it's been frustrating because I can't eat and I keep having to go back earlier because I am so tired. I think I might still be jet lagged although I don't know why because it's been a few days. Maybe coz I'm not as young as I used to be already because I don't remember taking this long to get over jet lag.&nbsp;

Vienna was disappointing. We went at a bad time where everything was CLOSED. They really respect rest days. Shops are closed on Sundays and we very suay the last day there it was a public holiday so everything was closed too. The main tourist sites were open but no shopping for us.&nbsp;

Hoping I will start to feel better and stop ruining Baby's trip."

"event","Do any of you feel like a machine, in a world full of monotony, watching the cogs and gears turn in their endless motions.  Looks a lot like your life, right?  Well I have a little something to say about that....

When the world dies, the cities crumble, the gears stop turning, burry me in its ashes and call it quits.  Leave all your possesions, for they own you; your passions which become an endless endeavor to us all.  In the end, they will never matter.  Will we matter when it all ends; once the final whistle blows and humanity is digested like all the other materials in the universe.  Afterall, we are all made of stardust; we will return.  

We are not the so called ""diamonds in the rough.""  We are all copies of eachother, with subtle differences but each a piece of decaying matter.  We are attached to our beliefs, or own ideas which will die when there is no one else to hear them.  you are no different from the matter next to you.

Some of us are born hopeful for a world torn apart by hatred and greed.  The corrupt rule the world.  They rule our lives and there is nothing we can do about it.  Elect the politician that says he'll make a change.  He's lying.  Real politics lives in us.  And it is dead idea.  Freedom...it doesn't exist.  Some of us are born despising the very fabric of our own existence.  Others come to this conclusion during their lives but surely it is too late.  Then there are Othrers come into the world with hope.  Are they the enlightened ones?  Maybe.  Or are they just poor souls that know one world but are blind slave to another?  

I just thought you'd like to know.

I would appreciate comments on this for it is quite a stiring entry.  Probably my worst.  Fuck it. 

Think.  Belive.  Slave.  Machine.  Who are you?"

There's a man in the lighthouse
Singing your name
He's all alone
Bringing the ships home

He's been loyal, He's been true
To every word he's said to you
So where have you gone?
While he sings your lonely song

Lost to the black
The violent and the waves
Forever hidden
Offshore, far away

Grey clouds are forming
off shore, in the distance
The waters are raging
And turning the seas...

And the ships come home
At the end of the day
Cargo aboard, saftely ashore
The only things lost 
to the prowd black sea
Is your soul and
The heart lighthouse

There's a man in the Lighthouse
Singing a song

"event","We spent some time
together walking
Spent some time just talking
about who we were
You held my hand so
very tightly
And told me what we
could be dreaming of

There's nothing like you and I

We spent some time
together drinking
Spent some time just thinking
about days of joy
As our hearts started
beating faster
I recalled your laughter
from long ago

There's nothing like you and I"

"event","I just got from playing laser tag with Matt, Sabrina, Nic, and Alex.  My freakin' gun didn't work half the time...pissed me off.  There were way to many little kids there.  We used a couple that were on our team as decoy's.  For some odd reason they enjoyed it.  I did absolutley nothing today..and it was great.  I put in For A Few Dollars More, an old Clint Western, which put me to sleep off and on.  It was nice.  It seems I eat a lot on my days off.  Always making trips to the kitchen and finding something...  I feel fat lol.  

I have to say, the last week and a half has been purely amazing ;)  I have been able to stop taking my meds and feel find whilst doing so.  I feel like I have been given a second chance to make things right and to do it the right way.  So many things have fallen into place.  I don't know where to start...so I probably won't.  I will say that the particular someone that I met is amazing.  I don't even know what to say about her other than that.  She is just amazing.  And her brownies are delicious, overcooked or not hehe.  Ordering Chinese is becoming my favorite pasttime btw hehe  Can't beat good ol' China King and a Killian's Irish Red Beer.  Mmmmm...  I am sorry I talk in my sleep..maybe one day I will say something worth while lol  We should run away...to Somewhere Only We Know...;)

I heard a song that I had not heard for quite some time today.  I was looking through my playlist and found a remix of Sex Bomb by Tom Jones.  It is freakin great.  I have come to the conclusion that Tom Jones is the dirtiest man in history.  I would attempt to justify this claim, but anyone reading this knows it is true.  The man is just nasty.  Old women love him...it's so wrong.  If you are interested in hearing this song, ask me and I will send it to you.  So yeah...I will be taking my leave now.  Goodnight Indianapolis."

"event","So, last night was interesting.  I am not proud of this, but I got so drunk...  I had a hang over this morning, but I am over it now.  I didn't get to bed till nearly 4:30.  Yeah, so not very proud.  I will say that I was able to get rid of some excess emotional strain.  (at least I hope I have)  She knows she can not treat me like that anymore.  I am proud that I finally spoke my mind.  So yeah, both proud and not proud of my actions last night.  Go figure.  

I have an amazing amount of random ideas lately.  Good for the writing thing I think I can do.  Happy about that.

Health wise things are the same...  maybe worse, but oh well.

Hrmm...

Don't have much to write at the moment.  

""A shadow and a doubt consume my mind.  Fear rises from deep within me.  What if the devil has come for me this night?  My hands begin to tremble and sweat runs down my face.  The candle still burns.  I am safe while there is light.  I can not let the shadows take me...I can not let them have me..."""

"event","The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
and a dark wind blows.

The goverment is corrupt 
and we are all so many drunks with the radio on and the curtains drawn.
We are traped in the belly of this horrible machine
and the machine is bleeding to death.

The sun has fallen down
and the billboards are all leering
and the flags are all dead 
at the top of their poles.

It went like this:
The buildings all toppled in on themselves
mothers clutching babies
picked through the rubble
and pulled out their hair.

The skyline was beautful on fire;
all twisted metal stretching upwards,
everything washed in a thin orange haze

I said ""Kiss me your beautiful, these are trully the last days.""

You grabbed my hand and we fell into it 
like a day dream or a fever

We woke up one morning 
and fell a little further down
as sure as the valley of death
I opened up my wallet
and it was full of blood."

"event","Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...just when I thought I was getting better...I get knocked down.  Boy o boy is it bad.  If only someone realized what was going on; someone to help me.  But alas, I have to face this alone.  The problem here is that everyone seems to think that this is something easily remedied(sp?).  I laugh.  No one knows what pain is.  No one can understand.  How far do I have to fall before I hit the bottom?"

"event","I have no idea what is going on.  Someone please tell me what it is that I am supposed to be doing?  I've started to think about things.  I think the doctor put me on medication without really evaluating me on what is wrong.  She has taken a freakin month to get me in for blood tests (which are on this coming Monday).  I talked to my dad the other night.  His docotor told him that there is nothing more that they can do for him.  What is that supposed to mean?  That they are giving up?  I hate doctors.  Their answer to everything is ""well, I can give you this drug...""  What a bullshit answer.  They want to make you a zombie so you can deal with whats wrong with you rather than really trying to solve the problem.  Or at least get a step closer to what's really wrong.  I'm afraid of having the blood tests.  What if I have the same problems that my father has?  What does that mean to me?  Hmm...let's not think about that.  

She leaned over to his ear and whispered, ""I love you...I think I would do anything for you.""  He asked her what she meant.  She said she didn't know.  He looked into her beatiful brown eyes and began the journey that he took whenever she was near.  He always got lost in those eyes.  Slowly, sleep took him.  When he opened his eyes again, she was gone.  There was a note on the table; she was gone.  ""It's better this way,"" he told himself.  He didn't mean it."

"event","It's been a long while since I have written in here.  For a while I had deleted this account.  Who knows why.  I guess I got tired of the only communication I had with some people was via internet.  I missed it though...I missed some of you.  You know who you are.  So yeah.  The world of Jeremy officially sucks.  I don't even know where to start. I don't know where I was last time I ever said anything.  
  I always felt sick before and I found out why.  I finally went to the doctor and told them what was really up...  So now I'm on meds that make me feel worse.  It won't last long they say.  It's supposed to make me feel normal or something.  Whatever.  I think that's why I dissapeared for a while.  Because of how I felt and all.  Oh well, I guess it'll all be good.  Like anyone cares where I was anyway lol
  School really sucks.  I've been sick a lot; most of my teacher understand.  It still sucks...I was doing well.  I've been ok all my other semesters...I guess it's ok that I had a hard one.  This summer is going to be so nice.  I can't wait.  I feel like i'm already living it.  
  I was really torn up about R before.  A lot of my messages where about her and how I missed or what not.  I was such an idiot.  She is a bitch.  Why could I not realize it?  All she ever did was hurt me, I always came back for more.  A few close friends made me realize it a while ago.  So it's all good.  In fact, i'm glad it happened.  It was about time.  Three years of doing that shit to myself.  I think i'm a better person now.  I feel different...almost lighter.  I dunno how to explain it.  It's good though, to forget the past and start working on the future.  
  I want to speak to someone in particular for a moment.  When you read this you'll know it was for you.  I miss talking to you on the phone.  We spent a lot of time talking.  You really made me feel better about all the bad things.  Don't think I don't call because I don't want to talk.  My phone died and I lost all my numbers.  I thought you would call...  I guess I was afraid to ask for your number again.  Yeah... so.  For some reason I think about you a lot.  Dunno what that means.  We need to do the dinner/movie thing.  It's killing me thinking about it lol.  You know we would have fun.  Then medieval times!  WOOO  haha.  And your leaving soon...so I think we should do something.  Just so we can not have regret for not having done it.  If it matters to you anyway.  It sure think it would be cool.  So yeah...  grrr.
  I've been so confused about everything.  It's like I have been given a new life and I don't know where to start fixing the things that were bad before.  It's a great feeling, except that I don't know where to start.  That's part of the game...finding out what to do.  I look forward to it.  Confused, but a little confusion never hurt anyone.  
  I think that's a lot for now.  So yeah.  Take care all.  Later"

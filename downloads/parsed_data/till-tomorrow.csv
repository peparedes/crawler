The soul transmits through fingertips, whether the instrument is pen, guitar, or needle.  It's true darlin'.

Brandi Carlile-She lives in Maple Valley!  
""closer to you""



""It's hard to let the miles pass me by,
Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes.
And when the seasons change again THEN I WILL TOO.
I just want to be closer to you

Tommorrow I'll be lying under you,
with a heart of gold and arms to fall into. 
I know that there migh come a day where my life is through, 
But I just want to be closer to you.

SOMEDAY WE MIGHT LEARN TO TELL THE TRUTH,
We might even find the fountains of our youth.
We all needed something real we all need proof.
I just want to be closer to you.

My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down.
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground"""

The phone has been giving me issues as of late, in order to communicate, I must see a face, and look into eyes to know what a person is actually saying. Myspace does work as an enemy, and also as a revealer...It aggravates me, the way you can see in comment histories, where someone wrote ""I Love You"" to another person, in the same manner they're saying to you now.  Then how do you know what is real?  Do we make ourselves blind, in order to believe in faith, which is loves child?  I wish to trust, yet, the genuine route is to trust thyself."

Well it's all right, doing the best you can
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand

You'll think of me, wonder where I am these days
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays

Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line

Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive
I'm glad to be here, happy to be alive

I'm satisfied

Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive

So we get there and are catapulted onstage because-we've never seen it before, there were about 20 of us onstage.  However, this number dwindles because one by one they were chosen to do atrocities-ben had to crawl across the stage with a girl on his back....then was told to be part of a huge humping fest....but refused to take part in that.  So, I hadn't been picked yet for anything-of which I was both grateful and terrified.  Then, My number was called and I was told that my name was no longer Caitlin-but Ralph.

The homeless in Tacoma get fed every friday night under the bridge. City officials had complaints from the company DaVita, that it makes them ""uncomfortable"" to have the homeless there.  So in order to occommodate to corporations, the city decided to oppress the city's own homeless, and when showing up, they were met with police threatening to bring large busses and throw them in jail. I beg each of you to send letters to city officials with your concern, and ragin' letters to the company DaVita.  These few people who are uncomfortable are I'm sure, living in heated houses and gauranteed food each day.  The thought of sleeping in the rain for one night, much less every night has never even crossed their mind.  Friday nights give these people an opportunity to be a community, to worship where they're comfortable, and I know that if I was homeless, I would definitely appreciate a new pair of socks, and a hot meal.  Mostly, it's a time amongst the weekful of scorn that they can be respected as more than homeless, but as people.  So please, let this be your top priority today, get your parents, siblings, friends, teachers to write, because if we know this is happening, and we don't stop for ten minutes out of our days of comfort to do something about it, than we are nothing.  Life is beautiful and must be respected."

"event","Tomorrow, I have a report due, a 50 minute presentation on friendship development in children.   I have not started.  This is not good.  

My sister is coming up from California tonight!!! I've missed her and her wild ways.  Last time she was here, she forced me to face one of my biggest fears.  She stole my keys and would not let me leave the Marlene's deli parking lot until I went in, handed in my application and spoke to the hiring manager.  I stayed in the car for almost two hours.  After her saying many lines from lord of the rings, and telling me that Aragorn wouldn't be afraid to do it, I went in.....tenaciously, I might add. See, I had never before actually returned any applications, and definitely not spoken to the hiring manager, and usually, I would make my little sister run into wherever and get me one. 

I have started to eat alot of dried fruits, nuts and seeds."

Whiz?
Bryn and I had no idea upon arriving at the daffodil parade that we were to be in it.  A banner saying: midland/parkland.   Represent.  Then onto the puyallup parade, where we were riding on a float, it was humiliation itself-I must have done something bad lately, ""instant Karma's gonna come and get you.""

Katie-Nag Champa actually doesn't smell as good when you're not here.  That's your reason to come home.  
Kings of leon play lovely music.  I saw the strokes and David Bowie last week, actually, he was not as good as the band that opened for him, the polyphonic spree, I so badly wanted to be onstage with them.  hm."

I couldn't stop thinking in my psych class today about how when I was younger, Shannon my mom and I emerged from Albertsons to go to our van,  Shannon of course went to sit in the front, but I wanted to too, on my way into the front seat to join him, Shannon proceeded to slam the door, my head was all nestled firmly between the door and the van, it definitely hurt, this compels me to write......you better stay in California if you know what's good for you.

"event","On Saturday, a humiliating experience:I was making a production out of Sandwish construction for many to watch, 15 people, watching me, make sandwiches in a line.  While wearing a visor, green polo and apron that says ""Sandwich Artist"".  Honestly, how meaningless can you get.  And how very far it is from who I am.  If you could only see it how I see it.  I started laughing when I realized exactly what was going on-in front of my rudest customer of the day. 
Oh, my brother just told me really hilarious news, misery in waiting.  actually, I just realized that I really don't feel like writing to livejournal readers right now."

"event","Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
We ask ourselves,
Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? 

Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God.
Your playing small doesn't serve the world.
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won't feel insecure around you. 

We were born to make manifest
the glory of God that is within us.
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.
And as we let our own light shine,
we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
As we're liberated from our own fear,
our presence automatically liberates others.

"event","It's ever lovely.  I saw Lynyrd skynyrd on Friday.  Shannon and I ran a few blocks to get there, worrying we were missing them(me in my high, high heels).  To find that we ran to see the opening band of whom all resembled the uncle you never wanted.  LS was really good, but the singer just didn't portray the songs as they originally sounded, and made you feel.  Then on Saturday, I went to see Reign, although I couldn't actually see them.  And I was ten minutes late for my first day of work-greeted with-""you're late.  Why are you late?""  I laughed the whole ride home-in shock that I actually had a job, and actually had to work.  Now I know how it feels to be the person on the other side of the counter.  frantic.  Ok, now, Katie and I were talking last night about how boys love to buy her expensive tickets to shows, and blatently love her alot, but with me, that never happens, I have to revert back to stories of when I was 14-15 if ever pressed to think of episodes with boys. While we were talking, A lovely boy calls, and is like ""Do you like David Bowie?"" ""Um, yeah, I think(knowing that he's coming, and knowing what the former question would lead to)He kind of reminds me of Murdock from McGyver. ( then I go into a lengthy discussion of McGyver, and how it ties in with my child hood, in an attempt to avoid the coming question...but to no avial)""So, would you want to go to a David Bowie Concert?...I was thinking if you drive, I'd buy the tickets""...this sounding all too much like a stiffling date, I say ""Oh, no,I would feel bad, I don't mind driving, I can pay for my ticket, I don't know..""  Of course I come to find the cheapest tickets are $50....so I think now I'm scared, I think he has already gotten the tickets, maybe I'll just tell him, UM, yea, I'll buy you a mocha, and drive.  But I feel bad, having someone pay for my $50 dollar ticket...but that wouldn't be a date, right."

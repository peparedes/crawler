"event","idk how to describe how i'm feeling really. i'm starting to get really stressed about money, which is my own fault. i should quit spending my money on shit(like weed and food). cuz i have 625 a month in rent, prob bout 75 for phone a month, 58 for Pclub, and i still have a $300 doctor bill to pay. i've been getting fewer hours at the dog haus (which is my own fault) and fewer hours at culvers, which if heidi doesn't give me the raise she told me i was getting 3 months ago soon then i'm gonna be a done one at the cut because frankly fuck that place aside from most of the people that work there. but all that plays back into where else can i find a job and i still want to go back to school so idk what i'd do for work when i go to school. And i know my expenses aren't all that high compared to some people and i'm getting a deal with rent and shit, but for how much i make it's enough to make me stress cuz i don't wanna lose what i have and become homeless.
 Then i have this feeling that idk anyone anymore, or that i've just lost touch with just the world. and again i can only blame myself, but it just seems that there isn't enough time for all the shit i wanna do and get done. i work most of the day, then want to relax or am too tired and i never have the same schedule so that always jumps around. i just feel very lost in a way. i know me atleast i just feel i'm wasting away, and i really hate stressing about money. i want more of it because i want to mainly finish with the tattoos i started and just get more. tattoos really mellow me out and allow me to deal with all the bullshit that life and people throws at you. With each new tattoo i get i feel more energized, happier and full of life. i find my body more beautiful covered with ink then the plain ol skin. Another reason i really want to go back to school, or i guess i should say just go to college, is because since i was hella slackin' at east and did night school and graduated. I feel i'm progessively getting dumber and dumber. like my memory is getting worse and i'm just forgetting things. and don't anyone blame it on the amount of weed i smoke, i had horrible learning and memory issues before that came. i feel also my vocab is slipping and words before tha ti knew how to spell i don't anymore. i just want to stimulate my mind and keep myself thinking and busy. actually make a difference in the world instead of sleeping or dicking around.
  But then with the whole school issue, i don't really know what i want to do. I have such a strong passion for animals and i want to work with them. i just dunno what would be a good fit. Especially with the failing economy i want to go into something that does pay well, but that i also enjoy doing and don't dread going to. well i love going to the dog haus but i can't work there my whole life nor can it really pay the bills. I keep second guessing myself and judging my capabilities from how i was in high school. even not in school i'd liike to think i'm more focused and determined but i'm just so worried that my previous problems of not giving a damn or hating homework or the fact that i will forget something i just learned super quick and then be lost. people have said well just don't do a full load take longer. i can't do that because if i'm not going into it with full force then i might as well not do it because i won't care as much, then it'll take longer and i'll be in school longer which is no fun or i won't take it as seriously. and theres also my view of my ""love-life"" but i cna't get into that because it'll seem even more of a cluster fuck than this already has. 
 I often feel that everyday is a struggle for me to just not give up. to keep trying. i know i need outside help but idk how to find the time to get it and still be able to afford bills and everything. my emotions can change in the blink of an eye. i can't always control my anger and i feel unhappy a lot. i know my life isn't super bad or anything. I'm grateful for a lot i have and the people who have been there for me. but i just don't feel happy. only when i'm getting tattooed/thinking of tattoo ideas or when i'm with natalie is when i really do or when i smoke weed(which if there's someone who reads this and doesn't like it then suck it. it's my life and my body, i can do what i want whether it's illegal or not. and if you want to form some sort of negative opinion of me because of this choice of mine then suck it again. it doesn't make me any different of a person, if anything i'm more open minded and less quick to dismiss and write things off since i've started. and i know how to separate work from play. work first play second). and of course some days are better than others where i'll just be in a better mood and chipper. im sure my eating, sleeping and exercise habits play a role in it all, which i'm trying to work on but is easier said than done sometimes....Going back to the school thing. i've also been finding it harder and harder to convey how i feel about something or how something impacts me. like with some things(animals, the love i have for my family, how a certain bands' music makes me feel, the person i love, etc. etc.)the emotions that are brought on by them or have for them are just so intense i suppose i'd say that i just feel i have to explain why i feel that way and which certain aspects make me feel that way and i just want to explain and describe every nook and cranny of said thing that it sometimes overwhelms me. i feel or hope that with more school, i can expand my vocab and thought processes to better articulate my words so that i can make people understand. and maybe so i can understand myself. who knows really. it's all weird. Life'll work itself out in due time. 
  I must also add that i feel a lot better after writing this. i've been meaning to try and do something in depth. i feel that i've gotten a bit off my chest. take it or leave it this is what came out.

p.s.-i did not go back through and edit this or anything, so there are plenty of spelling errors and jumping around and repeats of statements but oh well. deal"

"event","So...just got done watching Dragonball evolution courtesy of our bootleg masters from the far east and it was probably the worst thing ever. first thing that pissed me off is that Goku is a teenager living with his grandpa gohan. second he's in high school. third he's bullied at school and his nickname is geekoo. fourth he trains with master roshi for a quick second. alright fucking the numbering of them. the only characters included were goku, grandpa gohan, master roshi, bulma, chi chi and yamcha. and yamcha didn't even fight goku at all, he just trapped them in a hole and tried to get money out of em. no red ribbon army or emperor pilaf. wtf is this bullshit. master roshi is killed and brought back using the dragonballs and it only takes one kamehameha to defeat piccolo. i would recommend seeing it just to see how horrible it is. and there's supposed to be 2 more bullshit movies like this."

"event","first off, i could go on all day about how nuts i am about you, but this is not the time nor the place.

nothing is really new here. my phone is a fucker and isn't working, it's not the battery but something within the phone is preventing it from turning on. who knows. i gotta go to verizon tomorrow between working at the dog haus and culvers to try and get it fixed or buy a new phone. it's pretty much gay.
i had an awesome labor day weekend. well saturday was the best. tons of drinking, i think i killed about 20 beers and half a bottle of sailor jerrys, not to mention a couple of other misc shots. got to ride 4wheelers a bunch, drive through a swamp, kick up a dust storm and drive fast. it was great. and also my dear friend rachel managed to run into the back bumper of my car with a golf cart, but no biggie it's only a small scratch. it was pretty damn funny though. 
i guess that's it really, i've been pretty bored, and all emo-ish kinda despite always hanging with my best friend, idk it's weird. also i'm contemplating getting a 3rd job to try and save money to go to college. though if i did get another job i'd probably be very sleep deprived. i probably should just stick with two jobs, having a 3rd is probably reckless. 

until i return i bid thee farewell"

"event","yea so today has been pretty gay.
got to work, started trimming hedges, was at it for about an hour and 15 minutes. i'm almost done with most of the hedges when i bring the hedge trimmers away from the hedge/bush and for some reason my right hand comes too close and i shred a little chunk of my finger. talk about shitty. it took me a second or two to realize what happened then i went running inside with blood dripping/streaming down my hand. luckily my boss got back about a minute after i came in. we washed it up and they told me to go get stitches. it looked fucked. the doctor numbed up my wound after cleaning and what not and sewed it back up as best he could. there was skin and finger fat and i bled quite a bit. it wasn't too bad, and it doesn't really hurt. i just have to have it bandaged up until tomorrow. i got to go home from work and still get paid. pretty good if you ask me.
unfortunately i did not get a pre-stitched picture of my finger."

"event","so nothing new here really. monday ha dmy sister pierce my lip, it's cool, except for the fact it is really swollen and i was being a whiny bitch about it and took it out for a couple of hours, then i put it back in and it doens't hurt as much since i left it stretche dout some so it's not suffocating my lip.

and also in a couple of days or wheneve ri see my sister next i'll probably be stretching my ears to 5/8"" which will be sweet.

on another note about my lip, my mom has not said anything since she saw it, besides when she saw it she said take it out and i said no. and donald p. elwood said i had to take it out, but i convinced him to let me keep it, and i said i'd have a retainer in in a week, which with the way it's being might not happen, we'll see.

"event","National Day of Slayer
6.6.06 isn't a date that comes around very often (once per century, to be exact), and while plenty of stupid horror movies and terrible albums will be released for the hype value of the day that bears ""the number of the beast"", we here at NDoS decided that this would be a perfect day for Hessians across the country to come together and engage in something upon which we can all agree - listening to Slayer! Also, do you really want those evangelical Neo-Cons to have all the fun with their ""National Day of Prayer""?

Official Statement on Participation
----------
Listen to Slayer at full blast in your car.
Listen to Slayer at full blast in your home.
Listen to Slayer at full blast at your place of employment.
Listen to Slayer at full blast in any public place you prefer.
DO NOT use headphones! The objective of this day is for everyone within earshot to understand that it is the National Day of Slayer. National holidays in America aren't just about celebrating; they're about forcing it upon non-participants.


Taking that participation to a problematic level
-----------
Stage a ""Slay-out."" Don't go to work. Listen to Slayer.
Have a huge block party that clogs up a street in your neighborhood. Blast Slayer albums all evening. Get police cruisers and helicopters on the scene. Finish with a full-scale riot.
Spray paint Slayer logos on churches, synagogues, or cemeteries.
Play Slayer covers with your own band (since 99% of your riffs are stolen from Slayer anyway).
Kill the neighbor's dog and blame it on Slayer."

"event","I remember growing up like it was only yesterday
Mom & Daddy tried their best to guide me on my way
But the hard times & the liquor drove the easy love away
And the only love I knew about was hard love

It was hard love, every hour of the day
When Christmas to my birthday was a million years away
And the fear that came between them drove the tears into my play
There was love in daddy's house, but it was hard love

And I recall the gentle courtesy you gave me as I tried
To dissemble in politeness all the love I felt inside
And for every song of laughter was another song that cried
This ain't no easy weekend, this is hard love

It was hard love, every step of the way
Hard to be so close to you, so hard to turn away
And when all the stars and sentimental songs dissolved to day
There was nothing left to sing about but hard love

So I loved you for your courage, and your gentle sense of shame
And I loved you for your laughter and your language and your name
And I knew it was impossible, but I loved you just the same
Though' the only love I gave to you was hard love

It was hard love, it was hard on you, I know
When the only love I gave to you was love I couldn't show
You forgave the heart that loved you as your lover turned to go
Leaving nothing but the memory of hard love

So I'm standing in this phone booth with a dollar and a dime
Wondering what to say to you to ease your troubled mind
For the Lord's cross might redeem us, but our own just wastes our time
And to tell the two apart is always hard, love

So I'll tell you that I love you even though I'm far away
And I'll tell you how you change me as I live from day to day
How you help me to accept myself and I won't forget to say
Love is never wasted, even when it's hard love

Yes, it's hard love, but it's love all the same
Not the stuff of fantasy, but more than just a game
And the only kind of miracle that's worthy of the name
For the love that heals our lives is mostly hard love"

ok so i was in East(you know east high) and it seemed as i was in a hallway, but when i got to the end there seemed to be an indoor city street and there was a tattoo parlor. and in the tattoo parlor i saw nikki's dad and iwas like ""oog"" and nikki was getting a tattoo, also during that i was saying ""she's younger than me and getting a tattoo first, GAY!"" and i was all worried about her dad seeing me since he doens't like me, but i still wanted to see her. so i was hiding under a blanket that appeared. then miranda came along and asked me wtf i am doing and i said hiding from nikki's dad. then i begin like running and jumping, but it's not normal jumping it's the super high jumps you do in dreams like you're flying, it was really sweet. but i went beyond the end, and it wa slike east wash kinda but had a big snow bank an dit was at night. i then attempted to jump on thwe snow bank thing but i kept missing it, and when i finally get on it i fall off. at this point i figure nikki's tattoo should be getting done, so i go to go back to the tattoo place but i see a store like completely empty the phone is off the hook and all the lights are on, and i think, hmmmm free money. but i see a mexican out of the corner of my eye and start trying to talk to him and he says something about they all left and he works there. so i walk out and a few goth/punk kids say some shit to me about being all for what the media tells you to be and being for the war in iraq i said no to both and they tried to jump me and it didn't work. i eventually mad eit back to the tattoo place and miranda said nikki was ogne and it made me really sad cuz i didn't get to see her. then i'm walking around being all moddy and i do some more of the crazy jumping and i come back to the tattoo place again and it turns into a cuklvers(ugh they're taking over my dreams) and i start freaking out, i'm sitting on the curb waiting for miranda cuz they just closed. and i end uip inside but instead of it being the inside of a culvers it's the inside of an old ladies house but there is still a culvers style kitchen. and i'm like crying and yelling at miranda because she is nothing like herself. i follow her up some steps and i'm yelling about how she used to be able to sing and she used to have a ton of cool piercings. so i'm sitting on this ledge and she's on the ground and i'm playing some music or something and she walks away and i'm screaming. by this time it seems as though the ground has become flooded with like pizza sauce/toppings but it was different levels in different areas, to the right where miranda went it wa sonly like knee high, infront of me it seemed pretty deep and off to the left it was as high as the ledge, it seemed like you'd fall in but when i looked to the left i saw aaron and brandon j just standing side by side with their backs turned to me on top of the stuff. after this i start saying something i'm not sure what and everyone is paying attention they start crying and start eating the pizza topping like stuff as they stand in it. 

i don't remember anything after that, i then woke up."

"event","okay i am coming VERY close to just shutting down my potato gun project down and saying fuck it. 

i was first having the trouble for the connecting piece, i winged it with that drilled the holes for the grill starters and what not. now i was doing this for the 3""-2"" potato guns. alright so i got the connector guy goin and the starters, so i'm connecting the two, hooking up the wires so a spark is created, i have it all together for the grill starters and i've already used a lot of duct tape and electrical tape. so i decide to see if both work, one of them does not, so i decide to detach it, but while i'm cutting through the duct tape, i cut both the white and black wires. IT'S BULLSHIT! so i'm putting aside the 3""-2""...also another dandy thing was afte ri fucked that up now i have to remove the duct tape from the otherside since the wires decided to jingle around and now it doesn't make a spark. so i'm very pissed off, and tomorrow or some other time i'll begin work on the 4""-2"" potato guns and see how that goes, hopefully not super fucking up. 

and on top of the fuck ups, i've got my hand partially cut up, rotto zipped my index finger, scrapped the top bad with the files, cut my hand with the cordless drill and that's about it, but it's lame. 

ugh, people should help me so i don't kill myself."

"event","hey all who read this, i was wondering what your views on downloading music/filesharing are. 

so many people have bitched about how it's stealing money from the artists, but i think in some ways it opens up oppurtunities for them to make more. now i'll go in to why i think this. yes it does make them lose some money, but if you think about it, a lot of bands have more then one cd and also release merchandise such as shirts, stickers, patches and hoodies. now when someone downloads a cd without paying for it, the artist doesn't get the money from the cd, but if the person downloading the cd really likes the band and are really into music, as are many people nowadays, they will be more inclined to buy the other cds they can't download, and even the merchandise, which generates money for the artists. and you can't exactly downloading a shirt and wear it. 

and mos tof the ""artists"" that bitch about their music being downloaded don't really care about the music, just money...the way i see it, is if your material is being downloaded and you are getting more fans, then that should be cool. that's why i think Cold are being some pussies, according to JJO's website they're quitting because of poor record sales from their last album, which is lame. you all know i listen to quite a few not-so-much liked bands, and many of them have been kickin it for more then 10 years, they aren't letting not being super rich stop them from doing what they love."

"event","i don't know how to explain how i feel now. i'm starting to get over my depressed mood i'v ebeen in for the last couple of weeks because of the nikki situation, some of you know of it anyway. but now i feel, i don't know, some of my closer friends lately have begun to really really piss me off. one has a new girlfriend and he's just been bein a little bitch, cancelled out plans for the night, another has just been being iffy and her boyfriend had to be a cock-ass when i was at work and he choked me, i was extremely pisse doff, i wanted to beat the shit out of him. and the other all she does now is have sex with her boyfriend and get high. and like she wouldn't think it's a problem, it's just gotten to me because it's running he rlife, it's really pathetic.
i get really bored when i don't have something to do with my hands. i wish i had more money to proceed with my potato gun experiments. i like being constructive and making things, working with my hands. that's why with the missing so much of school i always made sur ei mad eit to ceramics and weight training. ceramics allows me to work with me and express myself in ways, an di get to use my hands. with weight training i ge tto better myself physically, and i can tell the difference, yea i'm still a very large guy, but i just feel better with myself after that class. i wish i had a lot of wood and metal material, as well instruments to use with them, in order for me to build, because when i build stuff, make things, be constructive it makes me feel better with myself.
i hate having to be around my mom and that fuck duane. it's really frusturating always having to hear how they talk with one another, i know it means they have feelings for one another it just annoys and disgusts me, because she acts so ridiculous and it is just gross to me, and i hear the crap they do, kiss retarded and UGH. 
i don't always know how i feel about things, i'm usually really paranoid that people are talking bad about me or they hate me, not everyone jus tthe people i care about and are close to. it's just i feel that people always think bad of me and don't like me, think i'm a horrible person and what not, even though it wouldn't make a difference to me, if they did i'd like to know, so i know to leave them alone, it's just i'm always suspicious of people. then it comes to the ones i am not close to, it's the fact i don't have much trust in humanity, the majority of people are jerks, incapable of free thought, or though it seems. i just don't know, i dislike greatly the majority of humanity. some might ask how i can when i don't know over 6 billion people, i'm not saying all, just most. there are aspects of some peoples tha ti've hear dof or learned tha ti like, alot of tribes in africa. they are free of so much propaganda(sp?) and corrupt government. they live on their own making everything themselves, they are truly good people, but not totally, some eat people, kill people, blah blah, but they do what they need, africa would be interesting to visit, also it's wher ei think i'd be able to acquire a real human skull legally.
i sometimes get in moods or phases where i feel worthless, like i wouldn't be able to do anything worthwhile, so i just odn't give a shit. i wonder how many people would react to and feel if i died, i'm not saying i want to, my lif eisn't horrible, i'm not complaining i have a good life, i have a lot of things others don't. i just wonder how people close would feel. in a sense i fear death, but not of no longer being here, a part of society, but of leaving without people close to me knowing what kind of effect they have had on me, or the role they've played in my life and how much they mean to me. 

there's so much more to say, tha ti can't word right now, my mom has pissed me off, she has a problem with me being fat, i know she wouldn't admit it, but i can tell she thinks i have a big problem and blah blah blah. 

bye people"

"event","so i might get my job at culvers back, which is some true cool shit. i say maybe, because i asked Corry and she said she doens't have a problem with it and that she'd talk to don. i dunno if she did or not, but i told Randy to call me about it, and nick said him and ries work tonight so thy'll talk to don as well. so if i get my job back that means MONEY! and that is what i love, because it gives me other stuff that i love. 

and on another note, miranda recieved the packaging to send my ipod back to apple(the stuff arrived at the house) so hopefully she'll send that out this weekend, or atleast hook it up fatty style then my mom send it out on monday, and  haven't a clue as to when i'd get my new ipod, hopefully within the next month, because i absoutely hate listening to all the unintelligent people on the bus.

so yea things are seeming pretty cool for the time being.



p.s.-i will also post this in myspace. 

p.p.s-who wants to go bowling this weekend, prefferably saturday?"

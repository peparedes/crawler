"event","<p>1. Let me just say that I thought most of the ""Journalist's Guide"" was bullshit. Rich people think that freedom means having the ability to consume everyhting that you can afford. But money is man made, it isn't real. It is only a symbol of one's ability to extract resources from the Earth or other people. The Journalist's guide brushes aside all of our millitary involvement in the Mid-East by pointing out our involvement in Yugoslavia- (0 ground troups, by the way).&nbsp; Anyway, if one needs a car to be free, how free is that?<br /><br />Cars are little burning dragons run on by human magic that consumes the world around it. We shouldn't live in big cities, either. They are exactly as Thoreau described them. What we really need to do is stop making so many people....<br /><br />As for the relationship between cars and the health of people, cities, and communities, I think it is obvious that cars produce unhealthy fumes and contribute to global warning but more importantly, Carstraffic and people traffic do not mix well period. People can't walk in heavy traffic. So it seems kind of obvious that cars keep people seperated. Bad for community.<br />Also driving is unhealthy. It is stressfull and takes up time one could be exercising by biking.&nbsp;<br /><br />2. In a city I can work, socialize, be educated, and recreate, and&nbsp;get groceries&nbsp;in the same area. I do not drive a car and I love it. I walk 10 minutes to work. All my classes are right across the Park Blocks. I shop at the Safeway and I scope out all the sales on bulk meats and save alot of money. The market even comes to my front yard every Saturday.&nbsp;I have made alot of friends that I see all the time throughout my day randomly. In fact, thge farthest I have traveled in the past six months is to Share-it-Square.<br /><br /><br />3. Cars are dangerous and none wants to live close to heavy traffic, so until we eliminate cars from cities, rich people will always want to sprawl out to give their children a safe place to grow up, which we all should ahve, obviously. And we really can't sustain ever growing cities. I can just picture america as either cramped city dwelling or huge corporate farm and that is it. Also, Cities are dirty and they put alot of pressure on things like sewer systems.&nbsp;<br />It seems so obvious to me that we need to stop procreating, reduce our populations and live in small, socialistic agrarian groups that trade with each other. Some might call this poverty but Orwell said, in my favorite book of all time ""Homage to Catoaonia"" ""I sometimes think the price of freedom is eternal dirt.""<br /><br />4. My favorite car-toon was the one where the guys are in an office and they are like ""I hate my job, but I need it to have a car"" and then they are like "" I hate driving, but I got to go to work. For my parents, it seemed like an enormous amount of the family's money and energy, which we did not have much, whent into maintaining two cars. Yes, they needed them to get to work, but they both had two jobs so that we could consume erverything that everybody else did. We ""kept up with the Joneses..."" so to speak. I became alot happier when I voluntarily gave up my vehicle after 9/11 and started living a more simple life. IO can make less money if I don't have to pay for car, insurance, parking, repairs...If I don't need so much money I can take a job that is closer to my house, I f I do that than there is more time to spend with the people I love. <br /><br /></p>"

They did, and then the DOJ turned out to be one guy, ""Chip"" who gave legal counsel in a secret executive session and did not put anything on paper to hold him to. As it turns out, the other guys have some serious political connections through the college democrats, I'm talking Kennedy connections. I think Patrick will be governor some day. Anyway, it is highly likely that Chip has his own agenda. So, the election is pretty much over, Rudy lost.&nbsp;

Next years elections begin today. Later tonight I should begin working on my website that chroncles all this and unites the student group that will lobby Stodent Government because believe me on this we need one. Nobody knows the resources $12million! that are available except special interests. The&nbsp;ASPSU themselves are always traveling to Salem to meet important people but in the meantime intruders like the ""Center for Bio-Ethical Reform"" and Sizemore's mercenaries invade the heart of our campus.&nbsp;

So the first issue for the lobby group is defunding ""Students for Life"" the group that brought those protestors here.
I am going to create social capitol on campus by fighting little fights like this. By next years election I will have created a party that is focused on the myriad issues that affect students here on campus. And we will win.

Once we win we will use the resources to activate the student body. For example, the&nbsp;current government goes to Salem to ""lobby"" as if they are changing votes in Salem that always come down to party lines anyway. Once they even organized a ""rally"" where they e-mailed students to get on a bus and travel to Salem to ""rally"" on the front steps.&nbsp;The students who whent said it was cool. I ask them ""who is your represntative?"", and they do not know. We can get so much more accomplished by organizing letter writing campaigns. This way student government actually interacts with people and teaches them about government. It builds social connections. ASPSU sees themselves as a lobby organization. This is politics that places them on a higher level than the rest of the students by empowring themselves instead of the people. This is politics taught by special interests like OSPIRG and the scariest thing is that these people will even tell you that. They do not see the big picture and realize how weak it is. ASPSU is practicing the politics of co-option. The political elites let them in to their ""process"" and act like they care. We are going to practice the politics of confrontation here at PSU after I am running the show. Then you are really going to see some shit."

"event","<p>I came into class the other day, someone asked me how I was doing and I said ""Sometimes I think it is totally appropriate to throw a brick through a window."" I still think that, but I was ready to pull the trigger a little early. In the student government elections, Rudy Soto won the Presidency, but the other guys are trying to steal it in the judiciary. It looked like they were going to be successful, until last Thursday when a gallery of supporters came out, voiced there opinions and demanded outside Department of Justice intervention. We made ""the Process"" work for us. Of course, I established as hostile environment as possible, but I think it worked as others joined in. Anyway, I am getting ahead of myself in the story. It was my experience with the petitioners that led to my involvement in student government....<br /><br />So I am sitting oustide the library, playing chess, ""my office"" as I like to call it, and I hear the petitioner lying about the petions and I yell ""How do you lie to all these people..!!"" the leader,&nbsp;6'3''265lbs&nbsp;comes over and tells me to shut up I'm like ""look buddy, I ain't no sucker, you want me to shut up you gonna have to do something more than just be big"" So he realizes that he is not going to puch me and says to the guy I am playing ""I hope you kick his ass"" I was like ""Fat chance of that happening, I have beaten him twice already. As a matter of fact, I have moved the pieces about twenty times all day. It is rare when someone beats me at a game and I think you I have just found a new one- you will be gone in a week.""<br /><br />Actually, it took almost two but they asses are gone now!!! Unfortunately I wound up in the student health center having a serious mental breakdown in the middle of it and I aint really been right since.<br /><br />But anyway, so I start approaching people who are about to sign the petition and try to tell them why they should not sign it, but nobody wanted to listen. I was coming off looking like a nut while the kindly older man in a P.S.U. sweatshirt was helping increase teacher pay. I think I actually brought more people to sign it just to spite me. That hurt!. So I change tactics and approched people after they signed it and told them how they had just been swindled. This worked a lot better. A lot better. There is a fifteen second window after people make a decision when they question if they made the right decision. It was almost like alot of people were wishing someone would come up to them and tell them if they made the right decision. It was a really big lesson in psychology- noone wants to be told what to think until after the damage is done. Even then, nobody wanted to do anything about the problem other than say ""That is messed up""&nbsp;This carried on for a couple of days as I actually thought I could start some kind of social movement at P.S.U. that would protect the public space from these political predators. Unfortunately I learned that ""liberal"" means we all going to be detatched and ignorant. <br /><br />So by this time I am really worked up and running hot. I needed help and I am kind of berating everyone on the Park Blocks about the situation and being ineffective. I needed help. I had gone to the student government office twice begging someone to at least come look at what was going on. No one did, all they could say is ""Courtney Morse, the President is in a conference in Washington D.C. right now."" Also, I had a class with johnny O, who was running for vice-president. I begged him to come help me, but he had no idea of what I was trying to tell him about. He looked at me like I was a nut.&nbsp; At the same time there was all these posters with his smiling mug around campus with big bold letters that read ""Working for a Better Community"". So I think everyone can understand why I wound up in the student health center. I figured that any group that would have johnny O as a vice president must be totally incompotent and I swore that Patrick and johnny would lose the election. I hadn't even met Rudy yet.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. I need to finnish how i got the petitioners off campus. Instead of trying to create a social movement, I started calling the secretary of state. over and over and over. Not much help there, It seems the Secretary of State's office believes college students are responsible for what they sign. I see their point, but if these people came to our campus and got people to sign fraudulent contracts that involved property, the police would get involved. Fraudulent contracts that involve the democratic process...Yawn...nobody cares...<br /><br />Then I go get the actuall petitions from the petitoners, I just walked right up and grabbed them. Then I took all their pcitures and I said the Secrteatary of Sate has launched an investigation. I lied. Then I went on-line and found two contact numbers for the petiton. One was for a company called Freedom Works. I left a message saying I had this crew down here for petion fraud and that the Secretay of Sate is coming for them and you need to get them the hell out of here. This actually worked. The bosses at Freedom Works removed them and sent them somewhere else.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I won, but not really. The petiioners just took their scam somewhere else, but I know where and when the time is right and I got enough people payong attention we will pounce.<br /><br />The other phone number was Bill Sizemore himself. I will tell you about that call some other time, but it involves me telling him to go to hell twice.<br /><br />Next time i go on I'll tell you'all how I got Rudy elected president just to spite the other guys<br /><br />and build and institution within student government that educates people about petitons yadda yadda<br /><br />and then they tried to steal the election.<br /><br />Been a hell of a ride.<br /></p>"

"event","<p>For my final project, I will be doing a presentation on the Oregon Voter Ballot Initiative System, and how people like Bill Sizemore are corrupting the system. I have a close and personal experience here at P.S.U. with these people.<br /><br />First of all, let me just say that many of the people who approach students asking for money or signatures on petitions are far from benevolent. I have a particular issue with OSPIRG, but that is another story. Anyway, there is big money paying these people to collect petitions and Sizemore represents corporations through a cpmpany called ""Freedom Works"".&nbsp;They word the petitions so that it is soo hard to understand them. this will be part of my presentation.<br /><br />So, here at the park blocks I was approached to sign petitions for ""merit pay"" public teacher pay. I am against merit pay, so I did not sign it. Merit pay establishes pay raises for teachers who have students who do better, usually on standardized tests. This means that teachers in rich white neighborhoods make more than in poor black neighborhoods.<br /><br />Then, all the single roaming petitioners disapear and a crew that works together showed up. They erected a tent in front of our library and wore P.S.U. sweatshirts. I walked by and saw the operation and said to myself, ""these guys are good, they probalbly have that merit pay petition."" &nbsp;I have long dispised these people who pass around bad petitions, but have always respected their right to do what they do.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, one day I was playing chess in the Park Blocks and I heard the head guy of the crew say ""Please help us increase teacher pay.""&nbsp;&nbsp; I was floored!!! This guy was lying about the content of the petitions. Merit pay is not increasing teacher pay!!! Students were lining up three deep at a time to sign this petition. He had a stack of five petitions- all had a lie connected to them. The petitions are hard enough to understand as they are written, but to lie about them is ridiculous. Even worse he wqas doing so in the name of P.S.,U. People thought their signature was improving schools but it was really harming poor schools, among all the others.&nbsp;<br /><br />It really disapointed me that sooo many students signed the petitions without understanding them. I have always seen college as a place that simply validates the bougoise youth and prepares them for future cultural domination of the lower classes, but that day I decided to take a stand. We, the student body, will not be a collection of stupid people that allow outside interests to come prey on them any longer, especially when those outside interests are hurting poor people. I will not allow it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gotto return to class, more later.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","1. Social Capital is the bonds of trust and unity people build by communicating and working together. Social Capital is a tool that helps groups to accomplish social and political goals that could have not been reached by individuals working seperately. Social Capitol is, to me, the ability of the people to challenge the power of government. Bonding social capitol is the type&nbsp;that &nbsp;similiar people within the same group aquire e.g. the Italian-American society. Bridging capitol is the type that happens when different groups work together, e.g. Christians and hippies at a peace rally.

2. In order for social capital to develop through working together and communication, the people need some sort of work to do. City Repair provides people with the opportunity to do that work. Benches are nice, and they do provide a public place, but building the bench together is what creates the social capital. It would be meaningless for cit repair to buy a bench and install it, although it may require less upkeep and seem more efficiant.&nbsp;

3. Question 3 to be answered later...

4. Unfortunately, my personel experiences involving community is rather tragic. My family has been obliterated by various social and personal problems. I spent a good portion of my young adulthood as an ""undesirable"". And nobody can understand just what I am so pissed about, which just seems to make me feel more isolated. I am lucky enough to attend college for two reasons- One, I found reasonable paying job, and two, financial aid. However, the &nbsp;job involved tons of hard labor, and now I walk with a limp and live in pain. I used to be an athlete for Christ's sakes, and now I can't even run. Nobody at that job I was at for seven years cares about me today.&nbsp;
So Honestly, when it comes to bridging social capital I can not name one activity I am a part of that I would identify as bridging. However, I have made myself part of some forms of bonding capital. I have become active in student government, and by the time all is said and done I'll have more friends than enemies. Also. we are part of the community garden. This has been really cool because once you work together with someone, you are friends. I can't explain, it just happens. We meet other people like us at random times who are just digging in the garden."

"event","5. Unfrortunately, I did not attend the workday event at Woodlawn Park. we all have to pay the rent, and I just got a job this past thursday and could not avoid working. I have always been somewhat resentful of people who had the time, resources, and disposition to do things like Earth Day work parties. For people where I come from, everyday is work day. I have always felt that the implicit message was that people who did not have to work so much were better people because they could do volunteer work. I know this sounds bitter and all, but...Anyway ""we are all living in an incarcerated situation""

7. So I interviewed some random people about Earth Day and not a single one knew the origins or real meaning of Earth Day. A couple of people were rather uninterested, but the seemed to be uninteresting. A couple others actually participated in Earth Day work parties for various groups I was unfamiliar with. They had ideas that Earth Day was about ""Protecting the Earth from pollution and destruction"" one girl even said it was about community, ahh how nice."

"event","<p>3. Traditionally Easter is a Christian holiday that marks the resurection of Christ from the grave after crucifiction. Easter is linked to the Jewish holiday of Passover and occurs at about the same time each year. because the holiday is based in the lunar calendar, the exact date changes but ti always falls between March 22 and April 22, obviously in connection with pagan spring equinox celebrations. Actually I have read some Joseph Cambell on this subject, and if I can explain it properly.....There is a pattern in all post-agricultural societies that there is a ""dying god"" who is born to the ""mother goddess"" or ""Earth goddess"". Usuelly there lies som sort of incestual relationship in the story. This represents the Earth giving life to the crops, then the crops die and fertilize the Earth.&nbsp;Because there is a connection to pagan rituals, the eggs and bunnies that are symbols of fertility have become Easter symbols.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.&nbsp; According to Wikopedia....&nbsp;</p><div class=""thumb tright""><div class=""thumbinner"" style=""WIDTH: 322px""><a class=""internal"" title=""Earth Day Flag.

The length of night and day is roughly the same. In pre-industrial and even agricultural societies, the spring equinox is very important as it marks the beginning of the season of renewal and growth. There is work that needs to be done in accordance with the seasons. Pre-industrial people needed to base their calendar on the seasons for this reason.<br /><br />2. According to Wikopedia, Beltane is a Celtic holiday that occurs at the midpoint in the year of the spring equinox and the summer solstice. The lighting of fires on mountains and hills of ritual and political significance was one of the main activities of the festival.Another common aspect of the festival which survived up until the early 20th century in Ireland was the hanging of May Boughs on the doors and windows of houses and of the erection of May Bushes in farmyards, which usually consisted either of a branch of <a title=""Rowan"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan"">rowan</a> (mountain ash) or <a title=""Common Hawthorn"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Hawthorn"">whitethorn</a> (hawthorn) which is in bloom at the time and is commonly called the 'May Bush' in <a title=""Hiberno-English"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English"">Hiberno-English</a>.

1. I think the most successful gathering place in P.S.U. is the Food for Thought Cafe. It is a really comfortable place to do work and talk at the same time. Comfortable furniture and computer access. Food, obviously, but there is a certain dimension to the place that is special- the service is incredibly slow and inefficiant. Thus, only people who are chilling ever go there. It is quite funny to watch people in the line, every fifth one or so becomes incredibly agitated.&nbsp;

The park block area is an interesting case study. It seems to be an almost ideal place as a public gathering- great places to sit, food , people, chess boards (which I use, if you play, Mr. Pedro....), even a stage. While people do meet and talk to each other, especially on nice days, it just seems to me the space is horribly unutilized. I think&nbsp;this is so because the space is gridded out and people see it as just a path to their next class, mostly. The crazy christians make good use of it, that is for sure. And the petitioners, and the PACS, and greenpeace, and OSPIRG, all these freaking outside groups seem to tell people ""Move along, lest someone bother you for their personal gain.""&nbsp;

2. Recently, I ""canvassed"" at the Urban center. I rate it as a very good use of urban space, with some flaws. There are places to sit, water, food, ""triangulation"". It feels safe from intruders and undesirables. I talked to students there who were very eager to talk with me about school politics. Because it is seperated from the Park Blocks, the people there had not been berated by campaign propaganda and empty promises. However a frakinf Tri-Met train comes through. Sometimes I walk around not really paying attention, allright I am stoned, but still, a man should be able to walk with his dog in safety from a train smacking him in the face.

3. The dialouge dome is cool because food can be cooked in it, although it is going to be harder than I thought to do that. The overhang&nbsp;and bench area provide a nice area for chilling. People have commented on a ""secluded"" feeling and I agree. I saw a woman reading in there by herself. Once that area is claimed by a person or group, it seems to be their's. However, while campaigning, I approached people there and mostly people in the area were receptive to conversation.

. The book bench is funny. At first I thought it was gaudy and took away from the architectural beauty of the building. But it is a cool place to sit. One can see down on the ""action"" (hotties..) on the park blocks. It is quite witty that the design is shaped like a book. Unfortunately, the smokers like to hang out there, but even if a bunch of people are smoking there, that is still community.&nbsp;

5. The Pioneer square has just about everything on the list that makes for a good public meeting place and it that. I watched Ferris Bueller's Day off there on&nbsp;a Friday night on a jumbo screen with a thousand other people. They even had free popcorn from a crporate sponsor. I have seen really good musical acts like Shoehorn and March Forth at other corproate sponsored events.

There is definately places to sit, thanks to the layered wall. Other people, I enjoy the hackey sack guys, hell even the ""undesirables"" are funny to watch. The philly steak&nbsp; sub cart is the shizzle. sometimes I play chess there. I just wish security there did not seem so mean and intrusive...""Move along, they seem to say, you need&nbsp;to be protected through this dangerous area."" One time, I was deeply involved in a chess game. Security guy came up and said ""How is the chess, fellas?"" In an overly frienly voice. Just so you know, chess players can be extremely anti-social. He was not welcome to talk. No one was. It felt like he was showing off his power by interupting us because he hung around waiting for an answer as if this was an interogation. So, of course I said ""Is this an interogation?"" He actually said ""Carry on"" as if we needed his permission to use the chess board. prick."

"event","<p>In some ways, City Repair is and is not what I expected. It is a lot bigger than what I thought. There are&nbsp; alot more projects, people involved, and things happening than I realized. I thought it was about 15-20 people who had fun together digging in the mud. Also, the ideology, paradigm, and thought is alot more well developed than I expected. This program does&nbsp; alot to challenge the dominant ideology, for example the primacy of cars in our consruct. The coolest thing I did all week was stand in the middle of a street intersection with about twenty other people.&nbsp;<br />However, it is alot of what I expected in terms of the willingness of the activists to work with the governemnt and property owners. I want to fight!!!! Not like City Repair is fighting, a little at a time winning people over, developing community, ect...I want to actually fight someone or something. I want to violently destroy the grid, blow it up, destroy the tyranny that keeps us isolated from each other. I know that this is not healthy and I am trying to change, but i am just saying that City Repair is what I expected in that the organization, in trying to develop community, seems to give respect to the &nbsp;notion of property rights, which I believe enslaves us. &nbsp;City Repair was started by breaking the law, the system changed. I say, lets look for new laws to break.<br /><br />2. Business districts have meeting places established in the form of restaurants and cafes. I can't stand it that these are privatized meeting places. It should not cost money to meet people. On top of that, people usually do not talk in restaurants to new people. I am predisposed to despise restaurants for the working conditions of the kitchen staff that I have experienced. Resaturants, to me, are a unique form of tyranny. Most people would call them ammenities, but I see them as an outgrowth of the specialization that is perpetuated in a property driven society. I know cooks making nine dollars an hour who have spent forty thousand dollars on an education but can't cook nearly as well as my mother, who makes a simiar pittance as a &nbsp;telemarketer. Go figure. Sustainability, to me, involves socialized food and farming.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. Most importantly, to me, the physical features at these sites signify to drivers that there are people around and that they should slow down. This makes the community safer. Also benches, art, kiosks woith community information attract people to the area. Art and beauty is important. Also earth building has such a earthy feeling that it seems to welcome all classes of people. </p>"

"event","<p>1. A typical street intersection is a horrible place to be called a ""village place."" First and foremost, street intersections are built for cars, not people to pass through and are unsafe. Usually, all space has been covered in concrete, there is no green space for safe play. Not only is the primacy of cars respected in the mental constructs, but also the market system. Storefronts and advertising are usually the only art. I believe the implicit message is that only consumers are citizens. Also, there are never any public bathrooms around. People cannot collect for very long if there are no facillities anywhwere. One has to buy something to be able to use a bathroom. Street intersections are busy places built for efficiant transportation, not collection, reflection, or communication.<br /><br />2. The grid has been around for a long time, first used in Assyrian millitary camps and later by other conquering forces such as the Romans to parcel the land, dividing the people so that they can be controlled. As new America moved Westward, the grid was adopted by the eltes to divide the land for efficient sale and development, after conquering the indigenous peoples. In 1785 the Continental Congress passed the National Land Ordinance which dictated the use of the grid system. I most definately think the urban grid isolates people from one another. Houses are seperated by streets, communities by freeways. The land was divided in the grid system for efficient sale-thus it perpetuates the construct of ownership which inherently divides people between haves and have nots.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. According to the website...</p><p><strong>The City Repair Project is group of citizen activists creating public gathering places and helping others to creatively transform the places where they live.</strong> </p><p>With a mostly volunteer staff and the help of hundreds of volunteer citizen activists, our many projects: </p><ul><li class=""level1""><div class=""li""><strong>educate people about why most American neighborhoods are socially isolating and culturally inactive, and how we can transform them from the grassroots,</strong></div></li><li class=""level1""><div class=""li""><strong>inspire people to both understand themselves as part of a larger community and fulfill their own creative potential, and</strong></div></li><li class=""level1""><div class=""li""><strong>activate people to be part of the communities around them, as well as part of the decision-making that shapes the future of their communities.</strong></div></li></ul><p class=""li"">City repair puts their mission into action by creating actual village places, bringing people together to do the work of building the place.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The Village Building Convergance event began as tea party that got shut down due to building code violations. After that the group did a neihborhood beautification project that was unpermited, hence an act of civil disobediance... Yay!! Eventually, the city recognized the merits of the program and co-opted the well meaning activists who were reclaiming public property (quite revolutionary, actually) and instead&nbsp; of fighting them, got them to respect the primacy of property rights by giving them offices and support. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>"

10. We respectfully refer to President R. Barbara Gitenstein as ""the Git.""
9. The best food on campus is probably going off campus to Wendy's and bringing it back to your room.
8. You live in a residence hall and not a dorm. Don't screw that up.

6. This campus will be under construction until approximately your 20th reunion.
5. That fountain in the science complex is a lot deeper than you think.

2. Those new apartments should be finished by the time you are supposed to live in them; however, we won't guarantee anything.
1. Your CA's and other staff members are awesome people...especially Debbie.


Top 10 Benefits of Being a Res Life Staff Member (the unedited version):

10. You get to learn such great skills like confrontation, mediation, communication, blah, blah, blah.
9. Staff meetings usually consist of either baked goods or a volleyball game.
8. Playing office poker won't get you in trouble with the bosses.
7. Nothing beats a good incident at 3am.

The 5 Reasons the Fire Hazard Group in Behind Closed Doors can't read:

5. Non-confrontational? That obviously means that Ricky punches Dan in the chest.
4. Smelled a match but know the residents don't smoke? That obviously means that Dan gets so fustrated that he lights a cigarette with the space heater.
3. Don't actually create a real fire hazard with the props? That obviously means tape lights all over the ceiling and by the sprinkler and plug in the space heater and turn it on.
2. Group eventually agrees with the staff? That obviously means that Ricky throws all the cards around and storms out of the room.
1. Fire hazard means something that can catch fire? That obviously means that Dan and Ricky wear a pink feather boa.


And since Craig Kilborn recently called it quits...""This just in...""

This just in. The sesquicentennial is going to suck. This just in.

This just in. The official ice cream flavor of the sesquicentennial bash is ""Screw You Over Strawberry."" This flavor encompasses TCNJ's tradition of screwing over the students but giving a sweet taste to represent what the students were promised but will never get. This just in.

"event","When the Construction is Over

It's time to look into the future...
The future?
Yes!  The future!  All the way when the construction is over...

New Residence Hall will finally be named.  It will forever be known as the Philip C. Dumbass Hall.

Because of poor organization, the blueprints for Centennial Hall's replacement will be switched with the original blueprints.  5 identical Centennial Hall's will become the new freshman housing.

According to plan, Travers and Wolfe will be demolished.  However, the hidden asbestos will contaminate the Townhouses for years.

After all of the construction is over, the oldest building on campus will be New Res 2.

3 weeks after the hockey rink opens to the public, an underground shift occurs.  This forces up the swamp from underneath the campus and creates the first regulation size swamp rink.  TCNJ goes undefeated for 2 years.

Due to the logo change, the bell tower on top of Green Hall is replaced with a crappy looking shield purchased at a Princeton University garage sale.

Due to huge success of this absolutely humorous site, I become a famous TV late night personality.  TCNJ still refuses to name any building after me.


The Office of Nomenclature Development

Notable name changes for the College of New Jersey:

Office of Residence Life = Office of Residential and Community Development
Crowell Hall = Science Complex
Trenton State College = The College of New Jersey
Centennial Hall = ""It won't be here for the Sesquintennial"" Hall
The Locksmith = Office of Access Control
The Photocopier = Instructional Technology Services
The Dumpster = The Travers/Wolfe Dining Facility

Home: What is Home?

This is meaningful.  It's supposed to be the end to something like 60 Minutes.
Home.  What is home?  I go to a house in Rahway every so often.  It doesn't feel like home.  That could be because we just moved from a house that we lived in for 18 years.  Or it could be the fact that while in college, I am changing...and the rest of family is not.  Things are different now in the house.  It doesn't feel like home.  I'm not saying that I have it bad, but just because I have a house doesn't mean it's home.  That leaves the school.  I did consider this place my home...up until 3 weeks ago.  I always went back to the same building after going to my house.  I started working for my home last year.  I would feel at home in my room.  Now, since I moved, I live, eat and breathe my job.  This room isn't my home anymore.  I don't really like being inside my room because it feels the same way my house does...uninviting.  I still feel at home when I walk into that other building.  Maybe that's why I continue to eat dinner so late...so I can eat it in the office and see some of the people I would consider family.  The same way I consider other people here like family.  There more than just friends.  They've been through it with you and then back again...and still talk to you.  In a couple of years when I leave this place, what will home be?  I just found out there is a possibility I could go to graduate school right outside of Chicago.  Will Illionis become my home?  Will my house in Rahway eventually become my home?  Why is it so important for us to have a place we can call home?  What is home?  Because this isn't it."

"event","Top 20 Things that have Happened in 20 Years:

Here it is.  A quick look back at 20 years, with the first Top 20 list.

20.  1984: I guess it would have to be walking.  I really don't remember much of '84.
19.  1986: Being able to recognize where I was going in a car by memory of what path we usually took to go certain places in 5 minutes.  The map-man skills were born.
18.  1987: Being in Pre-school and given regular milk to drink.  And then discovering the magic of mixing chocolate with milk the next day.
17.  2002: Changing my major twice in one year.
16.  1998: All those countless hours changing a video wall.
15.  1991: Putting a note into my desk so the CCD kids wouldn't steal my stuff and then having the CCD teacher write me a note back saying ""Ok.""
14.  1994: Watching my English teacher slip and fall right in front on my desk because the person next to me dropped a piece of paper on the floor.  She was out from October until March.  Man, that was freaky.
13.  1990: Falling Down on the 1st day of 2nd Grade and Getting a Black Eye without any pain.
12.  1995: Getting into my first fight.  Well, it really wasn't a fight.  It was the really fat, violent kid got mad at me and flatened me against the door.  Man, was he a dumbass.
11.  1985: (Most likely mistakenly) being allowed to watch the greatest movie of all time, Ghostbusters...and having my mother fast forward over all of the dirty parts.
10.  1992: Transferring back to public school and having Mrs. Ries for 4th grade.  I still see her every so often.  She's like an aunt to me.
9.  1989: Starting Catholic School and realizing how hot those uniforms really were on a girl.
8.  2001: Ending being a Senior for 4 years and graduating from high school with 50 other people.
7.  1993: Putting up that fight to not go to Gifted and Talented class because it was extra work and I was a lazy son of a bitch.
6.  2000: My uncle and I turning off the power out at midnight on January 1st so it was like Y2K actually happened.
5.  1996: Watching ""Ghostbusters"" and finnally understanding why the ghost hovers above Dan Akyroyd and he gets that funny look on his face.
4.  1997: Making Ms. Beam laugh until she cried with ""Death Rollercoaster"" on the day before Christmas Break.
3.  1988: Being brought across the street in the middle of the night, waking up the next morning at my neighbor's house and having a real breakfast before school (we had pancakes).  After school, coming home and getting baloons and tying them to the banister.  One flew away.  That was the day I became a big brother...to the kid that didn't stop drooling all over my stuff.  He has only recently been granted permission to touch my stuff.
2.  1999: Getting Hammered in Cape Cod on vacation with the family.
1.  2003: Knowing what it means to be a true friend and being a part of a great group of people & 1983: Being born on Thursday, October 13th at 9:20pm.

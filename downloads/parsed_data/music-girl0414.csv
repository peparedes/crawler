"event","I honestly don't care anymore. Some people, I'm not going to mention any names just because there are 3 people, are talking shit about me. I think, in my opinion, that these people do not have anything better to do than talk about me behind my back. I get irritated when this happens, because it's like, seriously? You have nothing better to do then to talk? If you have a problem with me, just tell me. Tell me calmly and not bitch at me. It makes it seem like people are still in high school, and you realize that there are some people who thrive on drama. And another thing. I am a patient person, or at least I like to think I am. There is one particular person who is wearing my patience thin. He doesn't have his license because it got suspended from speeding ticket points. So I am pretty much driving him around. I don't mind, I'm helping a friend out. Plus he pays for gas and my entrance to the hookah. Seriously though, there are times when, I work till closing and he asks me to go pick him. Which is a half hour drive for me. Ok, see here's the thing, I don't like driving by myself at night from where he lives. I told him this and he tells me to text him when I get home. Like, what's that going to do? Plus I drove him home in almost every weather condition except for like, a tornado.

On a happier not, I had a good time on Thursday and Friday. Thursday was a bonfire and I got to see some people I haven't seen in awhile. Which made me happy! Plus I got a chance to hang out with friends outside of the hookah. Friday was the usual hookah and then IHOP with friends.  Today I kinda felt bad not going with my parents to this art thing a vineyard was having. Like, even though I had class today, and I didn't have to work, I ended up staying home and slept. From what I was told there were was music and artists, which I am all for it."

In October, he decides to go to culinary school so he can start his own restaurant. So we ended breaking up and becoming friends. I think I might've posted something about this in previous entries. I had gotten a job at a sporting good's store, then I got fired because I wasn't working fast enough. Even though I work well in retail, whatever. I had gotten a letter from YSU asking me to take the semester off and see if the time off will help me with my studies. So in my time off, I got my hair cut short, shorter than my long hair, like I haven't had my hair this short since junior high. Plus it's a new color so I'm digging it! I went up to ITT to get some information about what they have to offer today. Sure enough, by the time I left, I had applied to the school and going to talk to a financial aid person about paying tuition. So I am now going to be going to ITT Tech for visual communications and I cannot be more excited about it! I think I finally found something I want to do. Now all I have to do is find a job and then I'll be all set!"

As for school, I am scared shitless to tell them Wednesday that there's a possibility that I'm not going back this spring semester, and want to take some classes in the summer to make up for not going this spring. So when they find out, it's pretty much going to end up with me crying and thinking my life is over because there is a good chance my parents won't resign my 2 loans for the fall semester. So that means, I can't go to school ever again because I'm going to be paying off loans. Plus, school is majorly expensive, and I know there are some loans out there where I don't need a co-signer. Still it's the thought. There are 3 friends that know my situation, and don't know how to tell my other friends about this.

Not fair in the sense that he is going to be busy with studying, that he's not going to be looking for girls, and that he has a 4 month externship to do. So he'll be done in February of 2009 altogether. I'm still going to miss him. I also still have feelings for him. I don't know when I'll be able to visit now because of him with school and me with work and school. He says that his partner has a boyfriend, and probably asked her the same thing I asked him. Do I have to worry about her? In his partner's case, Do I have to worry about your partner? I'm surprised that Jeremy went with her and not her boyfriend.

"event","So I talked to my mom about this whole situation. She doesn't want me to date Don because he is 31 and has a learning disability. Despite the fact that he is a nice guy, they (my parents) don't want me to date him because of those two factors. He is a nice guy to be friends with, but not to date. My mom tells me today asks me ""aren't you embarrassed? Don't you have any pride?"" I tell her that I didn't think twice about his learning disability, that it doesn't bother me. I also tell her that I talked to my friends about this, and that they had said that age is noting but a number, and that it shouldn't bother me. That his learning disability is a stupid excuse for  me not to date him. I tell her this, and she tells me that they (my friends) are telling me what I want to hear. When I tell people about my boyfriend Don, I don't tell them that he has a learning disability, that is 10 years older than me. How is that relevant to me telling them about him? I also asked his friends, and they tell  me that age shouldn't matter. One of his friends told me that her ex-husband was 16 years older than her. My one friend told me that her age limit for dating is like, 12-15 years older than her. Why didn't my parents say something to me when I went on a date with a guy who was 25, I was 18? Or when I went on a date with someone who was 25, and I was 19? Or how about when school started this year, in the fall, I was 20 and the guy was 26? I told them how old they were, but they didn't say anything about it. I am not dating him because I want a boyfriend. I am not rushing into this relationship. It's making me upset, and that I appreciate that my friends are looking out for me, that their opinions do count, and if they don't like him, they aren't going to tell me to not date him. So why should I break-up with someone who I share some things in common, have fun with, makes me smile and laugh?"

"event","So I'm sitting here watching tv, and I realize something. College prepares you for absolutely nothing. Sure, they provide the education you need to get a job, but do they really prepare you for life outside of college? No, not really. Look at it this way. When you get your degree, the jobs that are out there request that you have some experience. Where are you going o get it? There are some majors that offer internships and those give you credit for class. So there's the experience for them. What about the rest of us who are taking up classes that don't offer those internships? What about the job you have now? Some of the jobs we have don't even deal with what we are going into. Like my major for example and what I want to do. There is probably no way that I can get a job that deals with music and computers unless I am writing the program and selling it myself instead of working for a company that does that. So how the hell are we going to survive when we get thrown into the real world, and all we are accustomed to is college life? Some people have beaten us to that, they know what the real life is because they have lived through it, or is currently living it now while trying to make it through college.

I really can't say. I am so ready for Christmas break, to sleep in and just go to work with no school involved. I'm tired of hearing my parents in get into arguments, and having them bitch at my sister. I love my family, I do, it's just that I am tired of hearing it. My parents have their fights like average married couples, but I'm just sick and tired of hearing it. I'm thankful though that my mom got off my case for smoking. Hearing my parents fight, and then bitching about my sister, and then there's work, and school that fuels my smoking. The smoking band will help me quite, which will prompt my asthma to go back to being non-existed. What irritated me today was my sister. My parents, her, and I went to the Olive Garden that she worked at and got an appetizer and some drinks. Well, all of her female co-workers she introduced us,but when it came to her guy co-workers, she left me out. Like, ""these are my parents"" and that was it. Thankfully though, one of her co-workers looked at me and said ""you are?"" and I told him I was her younger sister as we shook hands. Then, my parents, especially my mom, tells me that I didn't like the car that I drive. I, in turn, got defensive. The reason? I didn't seem excited when I got the car, because I didn't have a license at the time, and that I didn't give the car a name. Things like that are irritating me. I'm just irritated lately and I don't know why. I'm usually not like this. Plus, there is this guy that I like and I have no idea what status to call us. Like, we're not boyfriend/girlfriend, but it'd be nice if we were. I'm not saying I need a guy in my life, but it would be nice if I did. School on the other hand. I didn't go to a luncheon that I was invited too last week. Plus, I didn't go to the class that I got the invitation from because the professor might have said something to m e about it. I didn't even start the final project for that class yet and it's due the second to the last week of school. Plus, I'm not doing so well in both of my computer classes. I'm just thinking why the hell I chose computers. My logic? To get out of this hell hole. Maybe living here has caught up with me and I'm just not giving a fuck. Plus, I need to go Christmas shopping. I need another job to help out with money part of shopping. Another thing that is irritating me is that I want to lose weight. I think that maybe if I lost like 20 pounds, maybe, just maybe, I'll have a guy that'll talk to me and ask me. To be his girlfriend. Maybe I'm just being irrational here. Or that I need better self esteem. I need a vacation, who wants to come with me?"

Saturday it was planned to go out for Christina's birthday, since it falls on a Wednesday. Then there is Nick's party that same day too.

Go to Austintown for the night, or even Boardman. No hotel parties, no alcohol, just out somewhere. Being in Youngstown and going to college tends to make a person strap for cash. I wish I had the money to get away, or to try to make my life a little better, like not worrying about paying for bills. Some friends have been asking me about Mark, the guy who likes me. I like the guy, I'm just not sure about how I feel about him that way. I haven't even thought of him that way. My friend tells me he is a good guy and that I should give him a chance.

How about, the employee that pierced me, charged me $2 on top of the earing price because the piercing was going into the cartilage! I went to Target and Barnes and Noble to walk around. I ended up going to Perkins, and waited for like, 5 minutes for a table in smoking. I ended up sitting next to 2 guys, who, one thought I was being stood up by some guy. I, in turn, went along with it. The guy didn't know why a beautiful young lady like me was being stood up. He then proceeded in the night to asked me twice where I was going after Perkins. One of their friends came to join them, and when he meet me, he kissed my hand. Yup, that's right, my hand. So then he tells me that ""You see that couple over there? That will be us in a week"". The guys were not even good looking. In relation to, one was married and kept saying that our waitress (we had the same one) wanted him, asshole; one was about mid fifties and asked me where I was going afterward; and the other one was also in his mid fifties look wise and he kissed my hand. I had an interesting night to say the least. I think I am gonna be scared after that night."

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I work in the morning. Thursday I work for like an hour and a half, then off to class. Tuesday I'm off for the whole day. So yeah. Class has been going ok. I'm actually catching up on homework and not getting left behind is great. 

I have gone a blind date recently. Let's just say wow. The guy's name is Pat, about 6'2, 26 yrs old, and getting ready to graduate this year. Nice sweet guy. Only problem? The words were to fast to soon. Like words that should have been said maybe a month, 2 months into a relationship. Like is your heart free to take since your hand was? You look even more beautiful in the moonlight. You have a magnificent smile and beautiful eyes. Calling me his queen in like 3 days and telling me what he was going to do with me. It was just to fast to soon. So that is done.

I know I have stopped smoking, but I have been lately smoking one cigarette a day. I need to stop it before it gets outta hand, like drinking water, I don't know! Something though to stop. Maybe read more, or color? Decisions decisions!"

Their life begins the moment their human creator, aware or not of being in harmony with the infinite, puts the finishing touches on them and surrenders them to the world. Over the centuries, life also brings them closer to old age and death. While Time withers and destroys us, it bestows upon them a new type of beauty that human aging could never dream of. Not for anything in the world would I want to see the Colosseum rebuilt, its walls and terraced seats in perfect condition, or coat the Parthenon with a gaudy paint job, or give the Victory of Samothrace a head.""

"event","Well, the family picnic went off ok, without a hitch. Though it was an ""omg it's hot outside"" day. Thankfully, I had my cousin to talk to though. Unfortunately though, I work tomorrow from 10 - 6, I don't like the long days. Then it's off to bowling, yay. Umm, what else is going on, nothing really. I just found out that my cousin has a facebook. I think it's funny, considering that it's him, he just doesn't seem like the one to have it.

I think my feelings for Jon may have subsided. For now anyway though. I still like him, but it's less than what it was before. Here is one thing I do have to ponder though: why doesn't he just ask Marianne out? It's not my place to push him or anything when it comes to things like that. Here's another thing that I have thought of: what if I went back out with Bob? Would my friends still talk to me even though they had an idea what went on that relationship from what I told them?

I think I still can relate to the song ""45"" by Shinedown. There is something about that song that I can still relate too. I'm tired of having my parents lecture me about school and how a degree will get me far. This is my last year at YSU if I don't bring my grades up. Which means no bowling on Monday nights anymore. I already fucking know this, so why keep telling me? I don't need to hear anything about my sister Stacey. I don't want them to fucking bitch about her when I am around and be home when they do. I am not my sister. I'm not in the NHS (National Honors Society), I am not a sign 6, I'm not as artistic as she is, and I certainly ain't as smart as she is when it comes to science. 

I guess you can say that this time at night brought out the bitchy mood. That this girl here needs to vent, just for today. I may complain on how hot it is outside, or how cold it is at work, or how much I need to find a new job. Could it be because of the heat? Don't know, though it could be a good excuse. Could it be because I'm nearing that time of the month? No, it's not. That makes me sad=(

"event","I had read this on a friend's webpage, and I agree with what was written. I sometimes see myself as a hopless romantic, and wish that there really is a romance, a person, described here:

""Hopeless romantics believe in fairy-tale love. They dream of roses and candlelight, walking on the beach at sunset, and dancing in the rain. They know that somewhere out there is a knight in shining armour ready to carry them off, or a beautiful princess waiting to be carried off into the sunset. Hopeless romantics believe in true love, and the eternal bliss that comes from being united with one's soulmate is what they crave most. 
Hopeless romantics recognize in themselves the ability to love infinitely deeply, and they ache to be loved with the same fervour in return. When a hopeless romantic has someone to lavish their affection on, lavish they do. Hopeless romantics sometimes write love letters full of poetic phrases and send flowers, but mostly they try to find a thousand thoughtful little ways to show their love. They make romance into an art form.

Hopeless romantics wear rose-coloured glasses. In their eagerness to find ""the one"", a hopeless romantic may either be extraordinarily picky or not discerning enough. Hopeless non-romantics think that hopeless romantics are delusional and too intense. Other than the seeming futility in the search for a soulmate, nothing frustrates a hopeless romantic more than a significant other who does not understand the hopeless romantic temperament.

Sometimes, in this cynical world, it seems like the population of hopeless romantics is declining. One has only to look at the number of movies and songs about love that are currently popular to prove otherwise. It may also seem that there are many more hopelessly romantic women than romantic men. This isn't surprising in a culture where a man might get snapped at for opening the door for a woman. Men and women often have different ways of expressing their emotions, and the number of hopelessly romantic men is probably much higher than anyone could tell simply by observation.

Hopeless romantics are the idealists, the sentimental dreamers, the imaginative, and the fanciful. They give the world its once-upon-a-times and happily-ever-afters. Hopeless romantics may have their feet on the ground, but their souls fly somewhere over the rainbow."""

One friend was there, hot as ever, yeah, I hooked up with him!! I'm excited about it. So I came to the conclusion that it's Jon's loss that he doesn't have me. I can live with that. I really can, I think. Today was Summer Arts festival and it was nice. Saw a few people that I knew, Chastity and Melissa. Tonight is a church festival with a few friends."

Wednesday, Battle of  the Bands, Jon's did great! Thursday was quiet as well. Friday went to the Park Diner, saw The Omen, and then went to Caribou Coffee with Andrea, Jess, Chastity, and Jon. Took Jon to Guitar Center to meet up with Kurly. Other than that, yea that's my week.

I am so ready to go on vaction. It might have to wait till Januaray though. My friends wanna go to Vegas, so do I, though I kinda don't. This Friday there's a hotel party and I kinda do and kinda don't want to go. So I don't know. 

So I told Jon that I like him and I thought things were going ok. Well, maybe not now. I read his entry online, and I know he likes another girl, but after I read his, I feel like a fool. He likes her and I'm getting the feeling that he doesn't like me that way. What the hell? Why do I get myself into these situations where I like someone, and ends up finding out that he likes someone else. Am I going always going to be the ""girl friend"" and not the ""girlfriend""? I'm gonna try and get over this and have fun, since I am only in college. 

So why do I feel that way? Why is that the story of my life? Is it because of the way I look, or is it the way I am? Is it because of when a guy meets a new girl after talking with me, the new girl appears to be all of a sudden better? What the hell? He's not my only friend, but sometimes it feels like he is."

Probably Cali a little more. I hope she has fun, and come to think of it, she'll be able to enjoy LV a little more bc she is 21. Soo, even more jealous on my part.

Friday was fun, spent it with Jon, Jess, Andrea, Sean (whom I haven't seen in like forever), Stacy (I think that's how you spell her name), Christina, Kurly, and Lori. Let me tell you what, Perkins was the place to be that night, cause we saw almost everybody that we knew there. It was nice. Saturday, went shopping and bought a new outfit. Denim boy shorts and a 3/4 length sleeve shirt with a brown and blue mix. Went to this Japanese restaurant where they cook in front of you, it was cool and the food was good. Tried The Park's pb&j, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and chocolate banana milkshake. They were so good, I didn't think I would, but I did. Went to a concert at Cedars, and walked around Youngstown, it was pretty with the lights in the trees and comfy out. Sunday and today spent it at home. With going to Dairy Queen and trying their brownie batter blizzard, with brownie chunks, had my chocolate fix for like a day and a half.

Let me tell you what, I am mad at my parents.They asked me what I got for my grades and I told them 1 C and 3 D's. I know I know, I could do better. Needless to say, there was some yelling, and that if I didn't do well this coming fall semester, I was told I  am done. That I need to get a job out of school. If I wanted to continue with school, I'll have to pay for it. That I can't go out during the week, only on weekends. Which I am ok with that because I'd rather do that. Now tonight I am going bowling. Of course, my mo wants me home at midnight. I think it's because of my grades. Though, I do have to take my dad to get his company van in the morning since it broke down, so I can see why she wants me home early."

Josh's party was fun. A lot of the people that he hangs out with and his friends were there. There was music and laughter. He left today for Fort Jackson, SC for bootcamp. It's sad, but if he wants to do this, then he should. I know he'l be back soon. 

I have been looking over the past entries that I have done. I come to make a decision, that I do care a little. Not a lot to make me a nervous wreck or to change myself. A little that I care. I care for my friends and family, and for people who need help, but not care what others think or do.

Saturday, or today however you wanna say it, my dad graduated!! We went to the Spring Field Grill for lunch with them and my sister Stacey. We came home and decided to look up times for The Da Vinci Code. Was going to go see it  at 6:45, until then my parents and I went to some winery on 45 cause it was their 1st anniversary. During this time I got information about what time me, Andrea, Jess, Chastity, and her younger sister were going to the festival. Since Christina was working late, she was going to meet us up there. 

Needless to say, I couldn't go see the movie, which prompted my parents to have a ""mini-date"". They left to see the movie, and I left for the festival. It was fun and we came up with the idea of going to Cedar Point one day during the summer. We played bingo, which was awesome because it was 25 cents a card or 5 for $1. Didn't win anything! I left early because my friend was having a going away party when he leaves for bootcamp on Tuesday. I left early there too because my mom had asked what time I was coming home. O course, the first thing out of mouth was about 1. The next thing I know, she wants me home no later than 1! The party was like a sleepover, because you were able to spend the night. When I left, there was a bonfire going. If I could've stayed longer, I would have at the festival and at the party. I feel a bad that I left both places early, but I had made plans for both and didn't realize that it was on the same day! I hate when that happens."

"event","Let me start out by apologizing, for those of you who I may not have realized back-stabbed. If I have, I am dearly sorry for it. Believe me when I say this. The reason for this apology, is that recently there was a dispute between two people who I care about, Andrea and Christina. Yep, I called you out Andrea. I thought (the keyword here is ""thought"") I was doing a good thing and told Christina what was on Andrea's entry. Well, Andrea and Christina talked thru their dispute and are ok. Well, Andrea had mentioned in her entry that I back-stab people and have a track record with it. That I thrive on pleasing everyone when I can't. That I should keep my mouth shut when I open it. That I should pay for what I have done. If I hear someone bad - mouthing a friend, whether it's on-line or I overhear it, I'll tell that friend. I never intentionally tell someone this and get them mad at someone else. That the people that we both care about know what happened and are not happy about it. If you're not happy about what had happened if you already heard, fucking tell me, don't  ignore me. If I lose anybody as a friend because of this incident, I'll be hurt, but I'll get over it and make friends. So whoever I may have hurt, it was not intentional at all, I thought I was doing a good thing. So if you don't want to be my friend, make that decision on your own and not have this incident make that deciding factor for you.

Andrea, if we don't hang out ever again, yea I'll be sad, but I'll get over it. I will NEVER EVER intentionally back-stab someone. I will make new friends, and go on my way thru life, continually finding myself and who I am. I really did thought I was doing a good thing here in telling Christina what you had put in your entry. She seemed hurt by what you had called her when I was talking to her. I do acknowledge that I try to please people, but lately I haven't seemed to care if I do or not. If you don't like me, then that's ok with me because you made that decision on your own. Yeah, your words did sting me, and they were effective. I am apologizing for what I have done and said, and if you decide to not be my friend anymore and decide to not hang out, like I said before, that is ok."

I saw Casanova with Heath Ledger,Sienna Miller, and Jeremy Irons in it. It was pretty good. I talked to Christina for a little bit when I got home. I also talked to one of my other friends, and asked me if I was going bowling Monday because he missed seeing me there last week! that made me smile.

I'm pretty sure that he probably won't read this, but if he did, he would think, oh my God, what is wrong with this chick? Am I being a silly girl who just revealed that I have feelings for Jon, or am I being realistic here and did the right thing by posting this section here? Jon makes me smile and laugh, which is always a good thing. I feel comfortable telling him things that I probably wouldn't tell other people.

If the ceremony was in the afternoon, i would not have asked for the day off. I probably would have asked if I could leave early. That's alright, not really, but hopefully I'll deal with it. I'm thinking about leaving the bookstore, but I can't seem to think of a good reason why. My dad has told me that anywhere else they'll work me like a dog, but I told him that that's what the bookstore is doing now. I think I am the only one that works the max hours we are allowed to work, which is 20. I also have 14 hours this semester in classes. They have me work in between my classes and work till closing. Which isnt good if you have a test the next day and want as much time as you'd like to study for it. I am glad though that this is the last full week of school, and then finals start. I have one on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, and one on Friday. I work everyday except Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. My mom had told me that if I want to quite, make sure I have another job lined up and then quite. I don't know if I want to do that though. I am thinking about finding another job on campus, but what?"

"event","Well, I think this is going to be a random entry, maybe with each line, or sentence, being something completely different. I am addicted to myspace.com, though I don't want to be. I find myself going on whenever chance I can get. Why is this? I so cannot wait till this school year is over with. There is about one full week left before finals, and then there is finals week. This is the second time that I have two finals on one day, this time though, I have to work later that day till closing. I am so not looking forward to this. I am going to be so tired and worn out, its not going to be fun. I also am not doing so well in one of my classes. I'll be happy if I end up with a D, though that is what I got last time. The reason for taking this class again is in the hopes of getting a better grade, and boosting my GPA as an added bonus. Not going to happen.

I have been talking to my ex for the past 3 months, which have been pretty good. I think I have gotten over Bob, though I can't be sure. This past Monday I went bowling with a few friends, and I saw him. We talked, and I think I'll be ok. So as of right now, I don't think there is anyone special that I'm crushing right now. If Bob gets a girlfriend, I think I'll be ok, it won't bother me as much as it did when I first found out. When I found out about his girlfriend after me, I started thinking. Am I that easy to get over, or was it how we broke up that made him find her so quickly? I may never know. Finding that I made him happy, that he enjoyed our relationship, and that I didn't need to apologize for anything gave me the closure that I needed.

You don't realize what kind of friends that you have. There are friends who are there for you, and those who aren't. There are friends who ask how ur day was, and others don't. You don't know what your friends go through until you are right there listening to them talk about what they went, or are going through, until right at that moment. I won't mention any names here, but I had non clue what some of my friends went, or is currently, going through. It is their choosing for telling, ot not telling me. I am not going to hold it against them for not telling me anything. I want my friends to be happy, and have fun in life. That's all I want for my friends, right?"

"event","My weekend was so much fun, I can't believe it!!! Easter decided to fall on my birthday this year, which I don't mind at all, this makes it the 2nd year that I can remember that this happened. That's alright, I still had fun. Friday was my birthday, and it was great. Got out of my 8 class early and didn't go to my next class. Called off that day, which was good because who wants to go to work on their birthday? At noon, my 2 friends took to me lunch, and got me a shit load of stuff. I got an ipod case, a Weezer cd, Kid Rock cd, Grey's Anatomy 1st season dvd, a photo album, a stuffed animal, 2 Napoleon Dynamite socks, and a candle that smells like a chocolate cappuccino. And a gift card to Lane Bryant (which is a clothing store for those of you who don't know what that is). Later that night, my friend Jess decided to have a party for me, and 5 of my friends were there. We watched TV and had music and there was alcohol as well. So I ended up getting drunk, and not remembering what happened after I fell asleep. Well, according to my friend, I got up from the bed, fell, hit my head, farted, and threw up. I remember being on the ground and throwing up and being asked if I was ok. Saturday went to eat with 2 of my friends Jess and Chas, went to see Scary Movie 4, then went to Perkins and ate something there. I feel bad that I didn't call my friend Andrea and told her what was going on. Sunday was nice because I spent it home w/my family and just watched TV and get catched up on whatever homework I had. NOw that school is back in session, I have to go to work today, which I'm not looking forward too. I wonder if anybody is going bowling today, if so who. I kinda do, just because it'll give me something to do instead of staying home and doing homework. I have to do it anyway, but still. Today was uneventful, aside from catching up on what happened over the weekend and asking how everyone's Easter was. It's a nice day out 2, which I'm so happy about. I painted my nails and toenails a color, and now that I'm writing this and seeing my fingers going up and down from typing, it's a bright color, like a 50 years old woman with platinum hair and a dark tan would wear. Maybe I'll just what till the color chips off and paint them another color. But which one? Eh, I'll think of something. Including this week, there are 3 weeks left till finals week. Then I get to work up to 30 hours a week at school. I'm not really looking forward to that. I'll survive, right?"

"event","I am so happy that this school year is almost over with. I must admit, I am sad that I might not be able to see any of my friends next year or during the summer. What bugs me the most, or I should say, what got on my nerves the most, was when my mom asked me if I was getting anything lower than a B in any of my classes. I told her in 2 classes I am. Which is true, my biology class and art history class. I will be forever greatful if I end up getting a D in my biology class and a C in my art history class. It bugs me that my mom asked me that. She could've asked me if I was getting anything lower than a C. I just want to tell my mom I am not my sister and I don't always get A's and B's in all my classes. So stop comparing me to her!! I don't want to be in her shadow, I was put put into her shadow not willingly. I didn't ask to be the younger sister of a smart creative person and be compared to her. I guess people expect me to be like her, to get all A's and B's in my classes. In high school, I had the grades to not worry about, even in junior high. Now that college started, it's a different story. I am my own person and accept it."

"event","The amount of fun you can have with a group of friends. This past weekend was so much fun. I had spent Friday night with my my best friends, Jess, Andrea, and Chastity just watching movies and being silly. Saturday was great too. Going bowling with Jess, our friend Bragger, and his friend Rob, even though we didn't bowl we just sat there and talked. We then headed off to Perkins to meet up with Andrea and Christina, minus Rob. Then, needless to say, we danced in the parking lot of Perkins, via the Electric Slide, with some other dancing too. The conversations we had were priceless, and I wouldn't trade them for the world. All I have to say is, Bragger is the epitome of the whitest whit kid in the world. He is redic, and if you were there last night, you would agree too."

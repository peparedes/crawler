<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v654/boostwick/100_0159.jpg""/>

And I made it all by myself!  God, it took SO long to do.  And then I went to get it framed.....apparently, framing is a lot more expensive than I thought.  Which is why Matty and Branno chipped in.  That's a 7x17 cross-stitch there, and it cost $92 to have framed.  Which was actually good, as the place downtown wanted $120+tax. And besides, it was worth it; not only did mom like it, I got the only cross stitch I've ever finished framed!

In other news,  2 1/2 hours until I'm leaving for KINGSTON!  I'm actually excited, they put the raft in this weekend (the one that took dad almost a year to build), and even though we're likely going to be haying, I actually don't mind. Surprisingly.

Now, must get back to work, and wonderful writeups on the viability of using J-Tracks as bearing tracks (nope, I'm not sure what it is either)."

"event","So, here I am at work again.  Only an hour and 15 minutes left to go, and then I can go home for the day - yay!  Hoping Robin is home today, lest I have to be by myself with Carl (who will be hereafter referred to as the ""creepy old man"").  

<lj-cut text=""Warning: Rant"">It's not that he's not a nice guy, I guess.  Sure, the smoking is annoying as hell, and our house stinks (it doesn't help to smoke outside if you're going to open all windows and smoke directly in front of them, dumbass), but he's not obnoxious, I guess.  More like inconsiderate?  He seems like one of those people who really doesn't know how to live with anyone else, or just hasn't for a long time.  For example, he has been here for a week and I have had to tell him MULTIPLE times to turn his music, or at least the bass, down.  He does it when I ask him, but then a few hours later he just cranks it back up again.  This of course,makes me feel like screaming.  I don't think he gets the basic principle that it it's TOO LOUD.  It is not going to be any better in 5 minutes, it will still be too loud! If I can hear it over my TV, with the door closed when I'm downstairs, turn it down.  I must have mentioned this a dozen times.

Other than that, the most annoying thing is he likes to talk.  ALOT.  Really, the only way to get out of a half-hour conversation with the guy is to avoid him.  I feel really guilty about being rude to people, but you pretty much have to walk away from the guy to get him to stop talking. He always tries to have these frigging long conversations with me at 7:00 am, and neither the fact that I'm stuffing my face or mentioning ""I'm late for work, I can't talk"" will get him to shut up.  And really, I'm not a morning person.  I don't want to converse with him normally, and 7:00 is just too damn early.

I guess the main thing is that I just feel like a stranger in my own house now - it's so awkward.  He's pretty much taken over the whole upstairs (including rooms he's not even renting, but don't even get me started on that), he never sleeps (he keeps me up half the night and then is up before me in the morning), and really, it's just weird having him there.    I think what people miss is the fact that even though he's perfectly harmless, and reasonably nice, it's still weird having him there.  It's still awkward enough that I'm going home for the weekend, even though I was just home last weekend.  The less interaction, the better.</lj-cut>

On another note, I (finally) received an email back from the French department, essentially giving me permission to audit that course (after checking with the appropriate prof, of course).  So, question is, has anyone else done that French Placement test?  If so, what's it like?  I get the impression it's at least in part computer-based, but I sort of want to know what to expect, as I plan on doing it sometime within the next few weeks.

Also, as previously mentioned in rant section, will be going to Kingston this weekend.  Hopefully I can convince someone to go see a movie with me (Batman, anyone?).  If not, meh.  And if anyone knows of anything happening, let me know.  I'm bored out of my tree up here.

Also, wish Kyle a Happy Birthday for me if you see him (I assume Erica will)."

"event","The last 24 hours have been hell.  Seriously.  Let's see, where do I start? Well, when I got home from work last night, I found out that we're getting a new roommate.  Now, that in itself would not be a bad thing, and I could probably deal with it, as long as the person wasn't a weird ass who stayed up half that night.  But no, not only do we get someone who's setting up a home office and working through the night, we get a 54 year old creepy man.  Now, I'm sure I'm probably overreacting, but it just creeps me out.  I'm sure he'll be nice and all, but still.....does anyone else think I'm crazy?  Or is the prospect of living with a guy that much older than me, who I'll be ALONE with in the house for hours at a time cause Robin's never there, seriously weird?  If it had've been my house, I would have said something along the lines of ""students only"", unfortunately, it ISN'T my house, so that's not an option.  I haven't told my mom yet, cause that'll go over well....I guarantee she'll tell me to always lock my door.  Don't worry mom, was already planning on that one.  Also planning on visiting home/ Bathurst ALOT. Read: every weekend.

Oh, and on top of the fact that I have to live with this guy, I was informed that ""for the next two weeks, he will be tying up the phone line"".  Um, excuse me?  I'm paying rent here too, and if I want to talk to my parents, I damn well will.  Maybe, if he knew that he was going to be moving, he should have made it a LITTLE bit more of a priority to get his phone line hooked up sooner.  Because it pisses me off that I won't get to use the phone to call Mom/Julien, the only thing that keeps me sane half the time, because he didn't bother to be responsible enough to arrange a phone BEFORE he moved.  Which is actually reasonable, and I could deal with, because I know it's hard to get one.  But if you can't get a phone  line for 2 weeks, you shouldn't be tying up mine, even if it IS for whatever creepy work that you do.  I paid for that damn phone line, and I expect to be able to use it.

So other than that wonderful news, which necessitated the cleaning of the whole house, and the moving of all my stuff out of the upstairs bathroom, cause there's no way in hell I'm sharing a bathroom with him, I also overslept 1 1/2 hours for work this morning (good thing nobody cares when I get in), had to dump my milk out because it had gone bad, and have lost my keys.  Oh, and my steel still isn't in yet, hence the procrastinating.  Yup, it's been a wonderful day so far.

Did I mention it's raining?"

"event","So, I'm back I guess.

Work's been hectic, and by hectic, I mean I sit on my ass all day because I have nothing to do save write a stupid thesis.  My steel, which I ordered 3 weeks ago, has yet to come in, which means testing of any kind has not commenced.  And we're 4 weeks into the job.  Yup, a quarter done and I've accomplished nothing.  Although to be fair, I DID get a call from John Rice today, exlaining that he'd been away from his desk for 3 weeks and had therefore not received my faxed order.  The reason?  Apparently, when you're past 50 you shouldn't chase after your dog, or else you might just fall flat on your face on a concrete sidewalk, scratching up your face and breaking your arm in the process.  Yeah.  So, since I felt sort of bad for the guy, I decided not to be too bitchy about the fact that I may very well have to wait another week for said steel.

In other work news, I'm thinking I may just decide to get another office.  That, or bring a fan.  You see, attic offices with no windows SUCK when the temp goes above 20.  Also, must remember to pay Tshering bak for the drink she bought me at the last BBQ...good old me, forgot my wallet at home.  Felt kind of stupid.

On the home front, not much else is new.  I'm down to one roommate now, who works 6 days a week from 4:30 pm to 2:00 am...guess how often I see her (I work 8-4)?  It was honestly weird not having the house to myself tonight.  Since I'm bored out of my tree, I spend the majority of my time watching random TV (watch Veronica Mars.  No seriously, really good show) and making Mom's birthday gift, which is a cross-stitch she wanted.

In my spare time (and, okay, some of my terribly busy work time too), I've been researching potential grad schools, seeing as how half of the application deadlines are in December, and you have to have made contact way before that.  Kind of scary thinking about that stuff actually - only one year left here.I've narrowed it down to maybe 5 or 6, which is actually good considering I started with WAY more than that.  My goal is to narrow it down to about 3, and then apply to all of those.  Current top-of-listers:
-   Queens
-   McMaster (not sure about this one)
-   Illinois
-   Berkeley  (okay, okay, I know that's not feasible)
-   Michigan
-   Cornell
-   MIT/ Northeastern (cause Boston would be a kick-ass city to live in)

Apparently, Illinois ahs one of the best civil programs in thge country, who'd've thought?  I love everything I've been reading about it; just one thing: do I really want to live in ILLINOIS?  I suppose it could get worse;  I don't care HOW highly rated U of Texas is, there's no way in hell I'm moving to Texas.

Well, this was pointless.  It did, however, give me something to do, which is good as my roommate seems to have disappeared and I'm by myself again.  Oh well, may as well watch another movie, seeing as how TV is le suck recently."

The victim called police from Saint John Regional Hospital at 3:03 a.m.

Sgt. Don Cooper of the Saint John Police Force said Sunday the victim had been stabbed at least 12 times and a 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the attack.

He is expected to appear in provincial court this morning.

As for classes...well, Dawe is surprisingly nicer this year - it's kind of scary, not used to it. 
Enviro I think I'm not gonna like - I hate overly dumbed down stuff. Maybe it'll get better though.
Construction - meh. As long as I don't get stuck in a group wth AJ.
Transpo - looks bloody interesting, other than the whole stats thing, which I can live with (although I appear to have forgotten EVERYTHING)
Foundations - looks good, and I like the prof. Too bad it's at 8:30.....

Four assignments due this Friday, and I've only got one done. Although, to be honest, it was the biggest one - my huge ass, I've-worked-on it-for-two-straight-days 27-page Strengths Lab. Gah! I hate those things. Still have Fluids and Strengths Assign and Stats to do though...ouch. Did okay on my Strengths midterm this morning, it was open book :D Yeah, and I kicked my latest rock test's ASS! (For those of you who do not know, those are EXTREMELY hard and I failed the first two)

Julien is downstairs writing up his ChE assignment; he's been working on it since this afternoon and he's only half done, and it's due tomorrow. I want to go see him, but I hate bugging him (even though he does need a study break).

Really good L&O tonight, so disturbing though. But it made you think. Wanted to watch the baseball game but I didn't know what channel it was on. Not that I'm interested in baseball per se. It was just more for the enjoyment of watching those damn Cubs lose. Because first of all, Jules was really going for them (for some reason) and second of all, those bastards beat my team. Which was really the only reason I wanted them to lose.

Had a fun thanksgiving in C'ton this weekend...wow, a real turkey dinner ON THANKSGIVING for the first time in my life. Got to hang out with Jules friends again too, what a blast. (Rankin the Ninja Turtles, hehe, we are so juvenile)

I'm SO excited for San Francisco, only 4 1/2 more months to go! That is so going to be a blast, I hope we get that extra person to go......

Okay, it's really time for me to go to bed. Probably going to skip stats tomorrow because a) the prof is absolutely horrible and I learn everything from the book anyway, he never teaches us a thing and b)I have a LOT of work to get done, and am super tired.

I miss you all as well....."

Paintball today. Wasn't bad, all in all. I had fun playing the game itself; it was the in between that made me wish I had been anywhere but there. Of course, since the game of the day was ""let's ignore Laura"", I may as well not have been there.

I hate being jealous or feeling jealous in any way, which is why I hate that I'm writing this, and feeling like a stupid little kid while I'm doing it. On the other hand, I DO hate being pushed aside because I'm not quite as attractive, or not quite as brave, or not quite as injured, or not quite as WHATEVER, as my other female group member. When I have to make an effort to get anyone to talk to me, or notice me, or make a mention that I was even there, it hurts.  Because I wonder what it is I'm doing wrong, or just simply not doing right, to have someone treat me like that.

It wasn't some large thing that happened, and maybe I can't even put it down in words how I feel because it will sound stupid when I do. It was just the little things, like not noticing when I did something good, or not caring when I got hurt, or not laughing or joking with me when we weren't doing anything. I suppose I should expect nothing less when I go paintballing with 7 guys and one extremely attractive girl. But still, when one of those guys is your own boyfriend...

So, all in all, wonderful day. Erin was mad at me because Jules and I woke her up, Mike is sarcastic and pissy because I had to d work and couldn't make his ""EXTREMELY IMPORTANT"" intramural soccer game, and I'm pissed off at Jules because he's being a general ass.  Um, maybe I'm just overreacting, but how cool is it to not wait for your girlfriend to get ready for the game (would have taken 5 minutes), and then suggest that ""there's no point in both of us being late. Just walk down by yourself later, and maybe they'll let you be a sub"". Yeah. Right. Like I was going to walk down the streets of Freddy BY MYSELF, at 9:00, in the pitch dark, when I don't even know where the goddamn field is, when I ""might"" be a sub.  I just don't know what's wrong with him lately. He's been all distant and bitchy and not himself at all.

Stupid self-conscious question: Would you care if your boyfriend repeatedly (and I mean REPEATEDLY, ie every time her name is mentioned or he sees her) makes a point of telling you or mentioning in your presence that a certain girl is hot, and how everyone wants her, and how she's the nicest person on earth, and how she's HOT....?  Again, I don't want to seem jealous, but I really wish he'd stop mentioning it my presence (and so often too) because it makes me feel quite self-conscious. Am I just going insane, or should I say something the next time he mentions it?"

"event","Just got back from the Cape. It was so nice to be able to go and just relax like that. Spent an hour on the beach on Sunday just laying there. Would've stayed longer, but the tide was coming in, and I didn't relish the thought of getting my towel, as well as my clothes, wet. Once again, had the good old beer and steak combo. I think it's becoming a Cape tradition for me.

On a good note, Jules called me, finally. I was glad to get that out of the way. He promised he attempt to pay more attention to me, and not just assume I'll be content to always stay in the background patiently waiting for his call. I know, he promised this before But I love him.

Sarah called me as well. Told me that she was originally supposed to be living with Ije, my roommate from last year. I laughed my ass off, I mean they'd kill each other in under a minute, I really don't think they have anyting in common. So now it turns out she's going to be living with Alex, Jules' friend from Campbellton. I want to meet this girl, but I feel as if I should reserve judgement. This is the girl, after all, who (along with her other bitch friends) snubbed me by not even saying a word (not even ""hi"") to me when Jules introduced us in Campbellton. However, even though I considered that horribly rude, I figure I should give her another chance.

My room feels insanely empty and yet full at the same time. All the distinguishing features that marked it as my room for the summer are gone, packed in boxes that are currently littering my floor. I can't believe I'll be leaving Moncton in 3.5 more days! The summer went so fast..although, to be perfectly honest, I cannot WAIT to be done with work. As much as I love it, the hours are really starting to get to me.  The plan is to get off work at 12:00 on Friday (meaning 11:31, lol) and then coming back, having a super quick shower, and heading off to Freddy for a few hours, where I'll drop off the junk that I've had in Moncton all summer (TV, computer, certain clothes, etc) before heading home (before dark of course, wouldn't want to worry mom!). Then on Sunday, it's off to Freddy for good.

God I miss everyone so much right now. People from home, people from Moncton, and especially those from uni. (damn all those who are up at orientation right now! I hate you guys!)."

I had such a blast up there. So many fun things to do, especially the touristy ones, like Parliament Hill, the By Ward market, and the Musee de Civilisation. Oh, and we went to Hard Rock Cafe, I got these 2 cute shirts that I absolutely adore. And a bear that Jules bought when I wasn't looking (""and here's the bear she told me not to buy...""). Plus, he got this amazing shirt and some Hard Rock Cafe drumsticks (which are only for show, I guess). Jules looks os much like his Dad, it's funny ;)

The train was so nice, I absolutely love traveling that way...true, it does take longer, but it's so nice when you're traveling with someone else and get to spend the time with them...plus, the beds are super comfy and you get a free breakfast.  I wasn't too crazy about being 3 hours late getting to Ottawa (4 hrs late getting into Montreal), but it wasn't exactly their fault, as there was a train derailment the day before in Drummondville.

I finally got my room assignment the other day. I'm not too crazy about the room, as it is rather small, but at least it's not the one on second floor that I originally had. Plus, I'm living right by a lot of my friends.  Quite frankly, I'm just thrilled I got into LBR at all. For those of you who are wondering, I moved for a number of reasons. To be closer to classes, to see Jules more often (because that hill just wasn't cool), and because the majority of my friends lived in that res already. Plus, it has the biggest rooms and the best meal hall on campus.  Oh, and Erica, we have to eat at McConnell for supper every night, as well as weekends, so I should see you there sometime.  For those of you who want to know, my new address is:

Ms Laura E. Bostwick
Box 48, LBR, UNB
Fredericton, NB, E3B 5A3

Tel No: 450-6991

Pam, I'm so sorry I didn't get to see you in Ottawa...I didn't get your email until today, because they don't have a computer there. I was going to try and call you, but i had no clue what your grandparents names were, and I figured there'd be plenty of Beauchamps in the book...but maybe next time, his Dad wants me to come up at Christmas... I don't think they live that far from Jules' dad anyway (he lives in Alta Vista)."

I just wish everything this week hadn't been such a disappointment - my room assignment, not getting sleeper to C'ton next week, not getting a loan, etc...

Even through this all I want to go back to Freddy so bad - I would give anything to be back there now with everyone I miss. 

But then I wouldn't be getting to go to Ottawa next week, an I wouldn't miss that for the world. I can't believe that it is all paid for! I only had to pay for my tickets up to and back from Campbellton. I've never even been to Ontario before, and I can't believe the trip is almost here! Not to mention, Jules is going to be the one showing me around. AND I'll get to see Louise again, before she goes away to Nipissing. And meet his Dad and Lyn too...I'm so excited!  Pam, when are you leaving to go to Ottawa? maybe I'll see you....

Today was fun, Stacey came up and we went shopping...I'm rather proud of myself, as I didn't go and blow my money...I only found one thing that I really wanted, as well as needed, but unfortunately they weren't in my size. Or even CLOSE to my size, for that matter.  Gah! I swear, every time I saw something I liked today, I'd look at the tag and it would say ""XL"".After awhile, I just stopped looking. Nice to see Stacey again though; she invited me to come down to Oxford because she was having a party tonight, but I didn't feel like driving all that way.

Just remembered that there was a work party thing tonight, which I also missed :(. Meh, it wasn't the staff party at least, now THAT sounds like fun.
Too much cleaning to do tomorrow: my car, my room, my computer files....I swear, if Yan would just stop THROWING GARBAGE ON THE FLOOR and the like, my car would not have to be cleaned every week. 

I feel guilty that I didn't go for my run tonight. But there's always tomorrow.

*NOTE TO SELF* Must remember to go pick up train tickets soon.... 

Yes, I'm going up to C'ton yet again. I love that place. So many things I want to do, but not enough time...golfing (Jules taught me how to golf! I don't suck - as bad - anymore!), the Brass Rail, alpine slides, sundaes, Jules' staff party and meeting Ryan and his boss (who only lets him have time off if he's ""getting skin"") and so much more... Oh well, I'll try to cram it all in.

Bah, must go to bed now, can hardly keep my eyes open. It's rather pathetic that my internal clock is set for bedtime at 10:00!  Maybe it's a good thing I didn't go out to Oxygen with Candice tonight...oh well."

"event","Such a fun weekend...
Shawn and Frank came up to visit some friends and brought Jules with them.  So cool seeing them again, Shawn is such a fun drunk (he let the guys shave his head the other night), and we all went to O2 Saturday night.  Parlee Beach the next day was fun too; perfect weather and the water was so nice...even though I can't throw a football to save my life! (I can catch one though, at least I'm not that bad!)

Bought this amazing new shirt at Winners the other day. It's a really thin pinstriped black shirt with black cuffs, and it only cost $20.00.  Every gaudy shirt we saw we said ""oh yeah, definitely an Evan shirt"".  The thing is, he can actually pull them off.

Yan STILL hasn't got a car, which means I'm still stuck driving him around...is it normal to put 124 kms a day on a car simply driving around the city? No, it is not.  I hope he gets one soon, because I can't keep paying this ridiculous amount of money for gas.  Evan was going to put a ""memo to inspectors re their cars"" in Yan's box, but unfortunately Yan arrived just as he was writing it. 

Jim - ""I need some tape to close this box""
Evan - ""well, I don't have tape, but maybe Yan can hold it shut for the rest of his life...everybody wins!""

I love my job...well, except for the designated chauffeur part.  The people I work with are fun, and for once I actually like what I'm doing.  Although I'm not too crazy about tomorrow, we have to be at work for 6:00 so we can do some core samples on Main or something. I have to drive the truck too (I hate that bloody thing!). Oh well, it's better than the 17-passenger van that Yan gets ;)"

I've learned that some friendships will last forever, and that some will fade.
I've learned to be grateful for the friends who have stayed with me - they will be there when I need it - and also to those who have gone - you were there to make an imprint on my life.

I've learned that I can love my body without being perfect.
I've learned that I can be beautiful even though my stomach is not as tight as I'd like, or my butt not small enough.
I've learned that beauty is what others see in you, and that everyone should feel beautiful.
I've learned that I am in fact a nerd, and I've learned to like it.

I've leaned that love can be found when you least expect it.
I've learned that it sometimes comes easier when you're not looking.

I've learned to live without the places I love.
I've learned to love new places (C'ton, Freddy)
I've learned that small towns aren't so bad after all.

I got my marks back the other day, well except for this one, but seeing as I'm currently taking it...
<center>Intro to Civil Eng - A+ (just show up and you're guaranteed an A)
Chemistry - A+
Computer Science - A+
Dynamics - A-
Economics - A-</center>

Brander totally screwed me on my econ mark...everything I passed in all year was about a 90, and since an A+ was an 85..where the hell did that mark come from? It wouldn't affect my GPA if I got it changed, but it's the principle - I worked hard in that class.  Not like he's responding to the email I sent anyway. I just don't want to seem whiny, because it IS a good mark...but still, I worked hard.

Sincerely hope I'm done this damn camp by Monday. People are serious when they call this thing 14 days of hell - your day consists of wake (at 7:00), do work, do more work, do even MORE work, end at about 8:00 or 9:00, have one hour of free time, then bed so you're not dead the next day.  We should be done by Saturday though *crosses fingers*. That way I can possibly start work Monday.

I can't wait for Moncton.  I mean, I have to shell out a TON of expenses, for my car and especially for insurance (approximately 260 a month), but it's still a great job, so I can't wait.  I'm probably going to buy my grandmother's car, because she's selling hers.  It's good because I get it for dirt cheap, but well, it's a HORRIBLE car.  Any of you who have ever seen it will understand.  Still, the whole purpose is for it to get me around Moncton, so I suppose it will do that at least (I hope!).

Time for ""lunch"".  Today, this will probably consist of cold pizza, or some other crap I have to cook myself. PLEASE, I need real food, and soon. Hmmm...maybe gram will bake me some homemade bread when I get there...it's a possibility."

"event","Wow.

I applied a few weeks ago for a job with the city of Moncton's engineering department.  I never even thought I'd get an interview let alone the job.  I mean, they're taking first and second year civils - I figured they'd call the second year people first.

I haven't got the job yet - just an interview.  But still, that's a first step, if I do say so myself. I really want (and need) this job.  Not only is it great practical experience in my field, it is also quite high paying (well, compared to the golf course) - $9/hr.

I REALLY want this job.

On a good note, my roomie seems to have disappeared."

Mechanics of Materials
History of the Physical Sciences

Took me long enough to get that scheule to work, you'd be amazed at how many conflicting classes I ran into...

Can't believe first year is almost ovr...just 3 more days of regular classes, nd then exams...okay, well then survey camp after that too, but I prefer to forget about that... Our last house dinner is tonight, followed by kegs at the Nut..for once, we re having kegs with JUST OUR HOUSE. I don't think that's ever happened before, usually they're with Aitken or Neville or Jones.  I'l probably go to Jules beforehand too, as per usual..although the drinking will be considerably slowed down this time.  There's something about drinking half a pint in 20 minutes that just doesn't sit well...and results in one's boyfriend getting kicked (hard) off the bed because one doesn't know what one is doing.  Made for some funny stories afterward though...and I still beat Pond at Family Feud, even though one of us was considerably more drunk than the other.

Can't wait until next year though...seriously, I don't want to come home! Well, it'll be nice seeing people again, but I relly love it up here. Of course if I get that job in Moncton (*crosses fingers*) I probably WON'T be coming home...."

or maybe I'm just delusional with too much to think about
or maybe there really is no such thing for me anyway

Campbellton this Friday
I'm so excited, yet so nervous
the thought of greeting to spend a couple of days with nothing to worry about
and just time to spend with Jules
is so refreshing
but at the same time, there's the nervousness
that comes with meeting so many new people and the hope
that maybe, just maybe, these people are going to like you...

Spent all day home sick today - didn't go to one class
including my chem lab :$
I have SUCH a headache
and I'd be in bed RIGHT NOW
if not for the 7,000 assignments they've decided to pile on me before march break

I just want to feel better
I want to dance, to have no worries
I want to forget about all the things that are weighing on my mind right now
like where I'm going to live
and what I'm going to do next year
I just want this trip to C'ton to turn out great
and this work to be done
I want to forget about the fact that if not for Jules and Co. I'd be failing dynamics...
and that my CE essay is the shittiest thing I've ever written
and just concentrate on the good stuff,
like where my life is now
and the fact that I have Jules
and the fact that really, I have nothing to complain about

But it's unlikely to happen

On another note, Canucks won 7-2 last night
I think I woke up and did a dance"

"event","LBR formal last night. I had a blast, so glad Jules took me!

The night started off well; Sarah Cannell and I got ready down in her room, with Claire doing both of our hair (i owe that girl SOOOO many favors). Started drinking too, listened to some great music, got all dressed up in our prom dresses!

Went up to Jules' room later; a bunch of people were already there. Drank some more ( I think you can tell where THIS story is going...). Yes, I drank ALOT. Not such a bright idea, may I add.  Of course, I wasn't the one who ended up throwing up, so it's all good. But by the time I got to the Elk's Club, I was well one. And I still had two whiskey sours (mmm...), strawberry cream liqueur and some rum. Ugh!

I can't wait until my pictures get developed, I have one of Pondo and Stacey that I hope will turn out....plus all the other great ones that were taken. All the guys gave the girls roses too, during the song Bed of Roses (I am such a Bon Jovi fan, I think that one thing made the night perfect).  I got two; maybe because I'm super-special?  Unfortunately, I didn't get to take them home with me...since I didn't want to hold on to them, I asked Cynthia to put them where hers were, under the chair. When we decided it was time to leave, we looked and someone had taken both mine and Cynthia's. But at least I got them in the first place, that's all that matters, right?

Can't wait for Tibbits Week next week! Pub Crawl + formal...whoo!"

"event","So here I am, back in Freddy.  Is it pathetic if you're stressed out after the first day? Because I must have been brain dead when I scheduled all my courses in July, because I put the majority of them on Mondays, making for a very hectic first day.  I dropped math 1013 too, since I already have credit for it anyway.  I was going to audit, but the prof just recommended I just not take it at all.  He DID recommend taking Math 2503, but with CS and Dynamics (2 VERY hard courses) already on my shcedule for this term, I thought it best to wait until next year.

I have most of my books already, or at least I know who I'm getting them from.  Just need to find a dynamics textbook and one for CE, it would be gret if I could get all used ones.

I still haven't gotten Julien's Christmas present yet. I wish it would hurry up and get here!  I know, that makes me sound rather greedy and materialistic, doesn't it? Actually, the real reason I want my present to hurry up and get here is so he'll open his present.  He refuses to even peek until mine arrives; something about how he wants to open them together.   It's actually rather cute, but patience is not my trong suit.

Getting a new roomie this weekend, her name's Ijeoma and she's from Nigeria.  She's 23 and she's never been to Canada before.  Should be interesting....."

"event","Well, it's been awhile since I've updated, hasn't it?  Meant to earlier, but there was Christmas, and then I was too sick....

Enjoying being home, with real food and such, even if it is a little boring.  I can't believe it's New Year's Eve!  Going up to Sarah Cannell's tonight with some others to celebrate.  Was there last night and we both dyed our hair.  Hers came out looking pretty good if I do say so myself (It's a deep red).  Since I'm too scared of any huge changes, I just made mine slightly redder.  So now instead of my hair being predominantly blond and slightly red, it's predominantly red and slightly blond.  I like it anyway.

It's only been a week after Christmas, but here's my Christmas list anyway!

-red, black and white turtleneck sweater
-red and black UNB sweatshirt
-red Tibbits sweatshirt
-red and white Tibbits baseball shirt
-Dalhousie ball cap and T-shirt (courtesy of Meghan)
-cranberry dress shirt
-red sweater and white shirt to go under it (notice a pattern here)
-printer
-chocolates
-Greco, Blockbuster, Coles, showboat gift certificates
-pint of Ben & Jerry's 
-sandwich maker
-""Procrastinator's Creed"" poster
-Canucks key-holder
-Canucks salt and pepper shakers (as a gag)
-socks
-desk organizer
-photo album and stickers
-Tibbits shot glass

Oh! and I got my marks back the other day, I did really good, I think they scaled the marks but that's not the point now is it?
Statics - A+
Mechanical Engineering - A+
Physics Lab - A+
English - A
Physics - A
Geodesy & Geomatics - ????

It bugs me that I STILL haven't gotten that mark back; everyone else has. And of course, it would be the only one I was worried about.  But hey, nothing I can do about it now!

So it's snowing and freezing rain and God knows what else out here, meaning I will most likely be spending New Year's with my family (whoo!).  I'll probably just stay in, watch some movies, check on the Vancouver game, etc.  I love home, but sometimes I miss Fredericton so much!  2 formals almost as soon as we go back (LBR and Tibbits) so at least that'll be something to look forward to.  I think LBR has a dinner with theirs too; that should be nice.


HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!"

I don't think I have moved all day (well, except to eat, of course).   Mom managed to pick up Julien's Christmas present, which you couldn't get up here.  It's a load off my mind, because if I couldn't find it, I was going to have absolutely NO idea what to get him.  And I'm curious as hell over what he got me.  All I know is it was rather expensive, you can't find it in Fredericton, and he bought it online.  Damn me for being so curious!

I really should get some studying done for my PHYS 1918 exam (lab final).  It and English are both on Saturday, and I have yet to tart.   But at least PHYS 1913 and CE 1013 are over, those were my two hardest and although I can't say one of them went too well, it'll be okay, I'm sure.

Two down, four more to go! (damn the stupid huge amount of engineering exams...)."

Supposedly, she wanted to ""push his buttons"". In other words, if I see that bastard within the next few hours, I swear I'm going to kill him.

Yeah, so just another long pathetic story that has helped to make my life more stressful than it already is and way more than it needs to be. I feel like there's so many demands on my shoulders right now, and there's nothing I can do about it.

We're supposed to go out to Frank's tonight and I want to go but I just feel so tired, both emotionally and physically and  I just don't know if I'm up to it. I'd rather just stay at home and watch a movie with Jules and not have to worry about a thing, not school, not jackasses named Jonesy, not anything thats making my life so stressful at the moment. But I do want to go to the party, and I know Jules really does too, so I think I'll go for a few hours.  Then maybe I'll ask him about the movie thing.

I hope I don't wake up tomorrow way more stressed than I am right now."

Life is about avoiding jealousy,

One of my really good friends just called a second ago and asked me to come over cause she was crying, I weasn't sure why at the time, but she was really upset so I went over to make sure everything was okay. Turns out one of her best friends had just got beaten up in a bar in BC.  It was the first time this girl had ever went out to a bar, and when she told this guy (repeatedly, I might add) that she didn't want to fool around with him, he just went insane and started beating her up in the middle of this crowded club.  By the time they pulled this guy off, she had broken arms, 2 broken ribs, and bruises all over the place.  She's in the hospital now and is okay, thankfully, but I hope that guy gets in a lot of shit for what he did, I don't care how drunk the fucker was, he just beat up an innocent girl who was younger than he was and also a LOT smaller (I saw a picture of her and she was really small and skiiny).

I don't know about anyone else, but stuff like that really makes me sick.  My friend was  undersatandedly upset, and she wants to be out there with her right now, unfortunately that's impossible. She also says she feels helpless and like she let her down because she wasn't there. I feel so bad for her right now.

But jeez, who beats up a girl in a crowded bar? That is majorly twisted."

Mine were just named the Grill Nazis cause they resmembled this guy who works at our caf grill
And me and Louise baked Jules a cake with her brand new Easy Bake oven (don't ask)
and we actually ate the thing, it wasn't too bad

							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Expert Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/expert.jpg""></div>

"event","ok, so I've finally applied to UMD, and I hope they accept me, cause I really like it there. Everytime I go back I like it even more. It's going to be really tough, and I know I'll need massive loans, but I feel like it will be worth it. The thing that sucks is that now that I'm 19, I'm not covered under my dad's insurance. Anyone have any ideas for decent, affordable insurance?

Oh yeah, quick update on my life: I now work full time and am manager at the dry cleaners, in case anyone was wondering. I also currently have mono, as well as and enlarged liver and spleen...i'm guessing that isn't so great.

So what sucks about that is that I'm not allowed to drink any alcohol which means no partying for the Superbowl (go Pats!!). That blows. 

My parents are worried about me having sex. If they only knew...
Well, actually it's probably only my mom, cause my dad's all like, well she's 19. My mom just doesn't want me to repeat her mistakes..? maybe. But I didn't have sex at 16, so I LEARNED from her mistakes. And if she really had any concern over it she would have had that parent-child talk about sex, but nooo. I don't even know where I learned about sex from. Probably the movies, hehe. 

Ahh, yes, my 19th birthday was Monday, January 24th. I've officially started my last year as a teenager. I have to start being responsible now, yikes!

Hope everyone's having a happy, healthy new year!"

"event","my allergies are bothering me and i can't focus..bleh

Things with matt are pretty much ridiculous right now, and if you don't know the back story, i'd rather not go into it on here, call me and I'll fill you in. Right, so I haven't talked to him since fri night, great boyfriend, huh? So I think I'll be breaking up with him. I know that I SHOULD, but I don't WANT to, as pathetic as that sounds. I really wanted to make it work this time. I sent him this big long message about how i was willing to try if he was, but apparently he's not, because he didn't respond. I think that there's something big going on here, but he's shutting me out, so I have no idea what it is or how to help him. I really want to be with him, but I can't keep letting myself be treated this way. I was disscussing the time that a bunch of us were at kyle's with my sister, and even monica noticed. She said, he doesn't treat your sister very well, it's like she's not his girlfriend. And thats when it hit me that he's sweet and caring when we're alone together, but treats me like I'm just some random girl at kyle's.
I'm sorry to bore you with this.

I read something very interesting online last night, at 2am, natch, but it went:
 We ask for advice when we know what has to be done..but won't admit it.

And i think that most of the time, that is true. We don't like to think we have the answers because then that means that we have to do something about things. Some of us aren't capable of that.

ok, enough rambling, i've got shit to do."

You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.

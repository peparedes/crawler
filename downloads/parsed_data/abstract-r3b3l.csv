or my prorities to my mother's standards.
my poor mother, she called me today
she still cant handle the fact that i AM gay
she told me she told 2 of her freinds, thinkin the verbal contact would alleviate some of the ""sadness""
but she's still sad, very sad. and it makes me sad
she knows no matter what im going to lead a hard life, and if i have children, it will be even harder
i dont want to have children, and i think that is half of the pain
pain pain pain everywhere, everything hurts.

it up out of this cigaweed pipe that looks like a cigerette, but isnt. THANKS JORDAN, one of
the most authentic people here, for lettin me borrow it :). the speaker was right in my ear, but it was fuckin worth it. that music is sooo fuckin pristine and elegant. it made me want to cry.
i was so plastered bobbing back and froth, from shoulder to toe. it was gorgeous
sorta like adam. :]
that face, o that face is so beautiful that face!!!!!!
and that bodyyyy
David and Adam.
did i tell u david called me?! DRUNK. damn closeted gay people. hahahah. no justkiddin
david is strait, but im going to rape him, RAPE, when i get back home
yah, so over the weekend he called me drunk. but i was passed out hahahaha. DAMN.

too be alone with you, id do anything.
absolutely anything.
his eyes, teeth, his ears with metallic dots, oh man its fuckin sexy
and his hair, the thicks ones on his nuts, the stiff one on his chin
and the soft ones that grew our of his scalp
i would do anything to be with him again, kiss him, lay next to him
my baby daddy! hahaahha

ive been thinkin to much. thats probably due to the fact that ive been stoned for nearly 2 days strait. hahahaha
it happens.
i had a good convo with angelique, jordan, and vanessa today
the minority and majority

WHY IS EVERYTHING IN THE GRAY
the world is a contradiction
its all about the balance, the equalibrium
even. balance. perfection in imperfection.
i would love to such on his teeth one more time
his soft chalky lips
stare into those ocean deep eyes
pupils dialated to inhale what i was giving him
i would do anything for the contact
for the feel of his bicep that strethecd long
the taste of moles and skin
there's nothing more euphoric then flesh on flesh
body on body, soul on soul
the essence of two mingling to create existence
heaven's not a place that you when you die
it's that moment in life when you actually feel alive.
I would do anything to feel one more time
just one more time
i would give myself for his eyes
heart, soul, love, existence, 
anything
everything
im nothing without it.
without him"

Me, You and Everyone We Know.
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING
it is such a deep, subversive movie that really touches you if you make the effort to comprehend the hidden meanings not only in the characters and the words they speak, but the scenes and the environment that surrounds them.
best part of the movie.
""I will poop into your butthole, and you will poop back into my butt. The same poope, back and forth. Forever.""
hahahaha, so metaphorical to the way humans live saily, shit passed back and forth! ... thats all it is... :p
yah but i watched that with Nicole and her hook-up Memphis, whose hella tyte! hes not dumb, just it seems like hes from a different era in a way or something, maybe not up to par with our culture :p. But hes supergenuine and him and Nicole are and will totally hit it off. I can see it already. That Lucky Hoe!!!
MmMmMmMMmmmMMMMMMmmmm... soooo i've been becoming more social and person-oreiented lately, :)
i dunno, things are happening, opening my eyes.
outwurd thinking. Yup. That's it. :)

O man, class this morning was sooo intense. Me and my fellow classmates in youth and social movement actually did something FUn & ConStrUctive, and established that Capitolism, individualism, the media,schooling... basicly the American system and institution is uber flawd and it supresses everyone. And communities that are more opressed don't have the time to rebel against the systemm because their so busy dealing with their mundane duties such as work, children, and the ""American life"" in generalo. And you don't learn about the negative side to capitalism and American culture until you get into college, and only the ""privleged"" usually get into college, the white middle-upper class who don't even need this knowledge learn of this oppression that their communities dont even experience. It's fuckin stupid but it's true. Most of the reason youth and other oppressed are so apathetic towards political opression institutionalized by the system is because they don't have any knowledhe of it. That's Democracy for you. How the FUCK are we supposed to be a democracy when capitalism put's us all in competition with one another, establishing the individual and deturring from ANY FUCKIN POSSIBILITY of a community. This was the first, and probably will be the only thing all 42 students in that class will ever agree on, hahaha :p. 

yup,yup.
Also, im gonna lie on my applications for jobs. my fuckin ingenious idea is to construct a fake ass resime that my family will be on-although not ""officially"" my family by last name connections, and fuckin cheat the system. hehe.
There's no honesty here, its war damnit! THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR YOU!!!!
hahaha

Gosh im loving the worl right now, except this boi named Matt, who is gay and is the most shallow person ive ever met. Ever.
he honestly has no positive traits, he's truly evil.

O yah. in the novel im reading by Edmund White, ""A Boy's Own Story."" 
the idea of cornholing, yes flippin cornholing, arrived early. hahaha.
it's basicly anal and that portion is what i've enjoyed the most about the novel.
but not learned the most from, that novel is flippin amazing.

alrite im hungry.

it's one in the fuckin same, DAMNIT! hahaha.
gosh college people are ridiculous. they bathe themselves in akwardness and situational irony, like the television they watch, it' pretty funny actually :p.
A Boy's Own Story - Edmund White- the gay rabid version of Catcher in the Rye, it's an amazing novel so far. The main character narrates his own tale in the most beautiful sentences you will EVER read. and meaningful. ""That was the secret of the imagination- its creations were feeble only to the maker but stronger than life itself to the observer.""
amazing i tell u. AMAZING! mmmm FroYo.... hahaha

So things in the middle/east/europe/asia are getting Oh so heated over the ridiculous cartoon that gave Mohammad a face and an explosive turban, lol. A Dutch cartoonist dared to make a religious joke, and the Iranians went fuckin haywire, they started destroying christian churches, attacked the Dainish Embassy, and are dieing in protests from themselves and the police force trying to subdue these massive riots. So an Iranian newspaper decided to have a contest that will mock the cartoons drawn about Islam, but for Christianity instead, lol. Fuckin reiligion is ridiculous, I don't think Muhammad would want all those protestors to be causing havoc on others, let alone their very own people. Where's the humor in the world gone, can't people take a joke? :p

ON ANOTHER NOTE. inward thinking is annihalative, haha I just looked that word up on thesarus.com, wurd up :)
and outword thinking is constructive, and worth it.
I think being selfless is the most healthy thing one can do, not thinking of yourself in terms of I, but we, or us.
It's less strenuous, and defnitely takes less effort.
From my own outword thinkin, I've learned that I become passively more comfortable with myself, overlooking social barriers that one typically feels when sitting down, quietly pondering about issues, but in ones own mind.
that kind of mental contamination will only get worse and worse, rotting your brain.
Well, that's what i think.
outword thinking, that's what it is.  Even this livejournal is outword thinking. hahaha
:p

So i think i have a crush, His name is Andy, and he lives at Merril. :p
deng, the first HOOOOMOOOsexual guy i'm not afraid of, since everyone knows I have a slight case of Homophobia. :p
It's the way i was raised damnit, why do you think i'm so flippin masculine! DENG. my parents fucked me up lol.
They also fucked up when they didn't learn, yes learn, me spanish. That's like my cultural roots right there, and they severed them in refusing to learn me Spanish, those bastards! I could be a bilingual hellion right now, commiting havoc on not only English speaking white people, but Spanish speaking ones as well! RAWR!
lol
you have to see this picture i drew of Mickey, who mite be gay btw..

I said to Poetry:""I'm finished

Having to almost die
before some wierd light
comes creeping through
is no fun.
""No thank you, Creation,
no muse need apply.
Im out for good times--
at the very least,

Poetry laid back
and played dead
until this morning.
I wasn't sad or anything,
only restless.

Poetry said: ""You remember
the desert, and how glad you were
that you have an eye
to see it with? You remember
that, if ever so slightly?""
I said: ""I didn't hear that.
Besides, it's five o'clock in the a.m.
I'm not getting up
in the dark
to talk to you.""

Poetry said: ""But think about the time
you saw the moon
over that small canyon
that you liked so much better
than the grand one--and how suprised you were
that the moonlight was green
and you still had
one good eye
to see it with

Think of that!""

""I'll join the church!"" I said,
huffily, turning my face to the wall.
""I'll learn how to pray again!""

""Let me ask you,"" said Poetry.
""When you pray, what do you think
you'll see?""

Poetry had me.

""There's no paper

""And that new pen I bought

But Dayum Anna's roomate, that gurl has quite a life lol. 
She has a black boyfreind whose baby she's carryin', and hes a deliquent that is in and out of jail
She has swollen boobs from breast implants
And she nearly got raped recently from this AzN guy who was given her money [payin off credit cards, buying her cars]
to see her goodies over the net, and when they went on a ""date"", he was in attack mode.
Gurl's got issues. 
So today we went to Charlie's [the guy Annas madly in love with for NO FUCKIN REASON, and hes not interested in her watsoever] party, and Rachel totally got in a Feminast arguement with him and his freinds, which was funny. But Audry and Charlie were exchangin strange ass looks, and Anna is compeltely blinded by her fuckin abnormal lust for this guy who looks like an ogre, its retarded. 
so me, rach, and her sister ari left that lame ass party that Charlie didnt even want us to go to anyway.

my wisdom teeth are also coming in, which is fuckin retarded cuz shit keeps gettin stuck between my gums (that the teeth are tearing apart) and the actual teeth. o well, hehe.

so, in shit that actually matters. There was an attack on the gays in Missouri, this homophobic white hick went into a gay nightclub, pulled out a hatchet, Yes. a hatchet. and started attackin people. THen he pulled out an effin gun and started shootin. 
He left. They found him on the freeway.
Bitch THEN killed an officer and some lady whose car he jacked.
Dudes in critical condition. Wow that's evil for you. He was probably Christian to. hahaha
O WOW. this car just drove by on Heller honking hahahaha. 
But yeah, i've also come to understand the White Privleged Male cannot understand anything, watsoever, at all
They are totally ignorant and prejudice to women, religion, gays, any minority basicly. 
I saw the best example of that today at Charlie's party. sooooooo fuckin EVERYTHINGist. lol
o yah. look wat bush said.
""This competitive world is going to demand a job skill set that emphasizes math and science,"" he said. ""If our kids don't have the talents necessary to compete, those jobs won't go away, they'll just go to another country."" -CNN.com
i just happened to have it copy&pasted hahaha, cuz ive been showin every1.
Capitolism will be humanities downfall. So much greed by the green.
green used to be my favorite color, it was the money i'm sure.
I heard a good love quote today: If a man doesn't sweep you of your feet, he's not worth being swept under your rug.
Good ay? thanx Kim. :]

Alright. i feel like i wanna say more. but i dunno wat to say anymore

the social standard is bull shit
the world is only what we perceive
and everyone sees differently
so the world is different
we are all different
commonility is found in difference
just as we are all equally unique
accept it, embrace it, don't try to change it.
it's easier to count sand than change someone's opinion."

it's a fact that the human mental capacity is extremely limited by the cultural institution we are raised in. It's everywhere. EvErYwHeRe. 
We need to have another Counter-Culture movement like in the 60s.
LCD- the drug that expands the human mind to a panoramic view of the world
it rids the consciousness of self and makes one selfless, one with all things
as it shuld be.

Capitalism can't work in the long run, for it puts everyone against one another, and focuses too much on the individual rather then the society as one communal being. WIll we ever find balance? prolly not. WATEVS.

Sufjan Stevens and Owen are pretty cool artists, i just DLd them, amazing acoustic/happy stuff. It makes me content and not so Spazztastic, which is the Louis everyone is used to.
I'm also pretty confident in my ability to write out coherent thought that is for me, such as this.
You see in my other entries they are rushed, very short, and stagnant with unimportant shit. Well, most of it at least. :p.
It's like xanga all over again, ""Today...blah blah blah."" A weak social attempt to make your readers jealous and force them to perceive you as cool. hehe. 

ANYWAYS, TODAY I ATE, HUNG OUT, HAD FUN.
Oh. i smoked last nite like at 1 AM, them i had a midterm at 8AM. hahahaha.
i did pretty well i hope, the teacher Pamela Perry is pretty bogus, and our TA is from El Salvador or something, so he speaks fragmented English, but his artistic soul really limits his ablity to argue in a class full of activists.
""youth & social movement."" can't help it.

AND ALSO.[ i need to work on transitions form paragraph to paragraph, its getting ridiculous.]
There's been alot of drama surrounding rachel involving hannah and angelique, it's partially my fault.
I tell her things that they say about her, and she gets mad. What you don;t know wont hurt you, Imma start livin
by that policy, it'll make alot of people alot less stressed out.

Well, gym & swimming tomorrow at 7 in the morning, so imma catch some sleep
Gosh, i cant help it, i miss him
<img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y79/uRn/PICT0426.jpg"" alt=""HTML Dog"" />

the sensation is like a calligraphy that never stops grafting your ethereal presence
let it be known, the roots unsown and seeds malnourished, love is of the soul
and I can feel you everytime time I'm floating in heaven.
cemented in reverse, as the blacktop drys, eternalizing the D&S
a whimper exits along with a drop of water from me
because my dreams are fantasy thoughts i've constructed in vanity of LOVE."

"event","WOOOO Yesterday was intenseee!!!!
MEChA had a Gender Workshop for everyone at the general body meeting.
We were separated into two groups, male and female, and we were 
given the task of writing down words to describe the opposing gender
it was horrible, this is what it sorta looked like each one wrote..

Girls     |    Guys
strong    |    slut
loving    |    whore
prideful  |   Bitch
dick      |   donkey
egocentric|   cunt

yeah.... that was a major problem. haha
the gurls were hurt, people cried, tension soured the atmoshpere and everything.
Gender is a touchy subject, it's different from sexual orientation, or racial issues.
Its black and white, male and female, there are very few gray lines.
So a couple males got defensive about the vocab, and women attacked
they even attacked eachother because even they accused themselves of occassionaly
using that kind of vocab to describe the female gender. Funny shit if I'd say :p.
It's hard to rebel agaisnt something that's been implanted since birth,
we see women being oppressed in Religion, Politics, In the Workforce, At school, at home
On television, in newspapers, In movies.... damn, and everything is ""ok.""

We strive for equality when inequality is built into the system.


And im also putting plastic people are in the past.
its time to move on to the fun shit!
btw. drama and racism are never gone. it follows you everywhere.
people ALWAYS want to pass judgement. its human nature. 
so Get used to it. And when your the ""minority"" and the ""other""
you're gonna be the first to notice, because its the ""Majority"" 
that will constantly shove it in your face
over and over and over, in everything you do, 
from the dining hall to the bathroom sink.

So life is getting lighter, i'm a little worried that I'm not so worried about my classes and stuff.
It seems like people are stressing out major and im just bein laid back bout everything. haha.
academic probabation can get people on their toes. :p

G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gg-g-g-g-g-ggg U NOT!!!
hahaha
btw u gotta see this dude scream a silverstein song, its the funniset shit ever

It was an uproar!
the clanking handles and comely smiles of their handlers made sound,
in the spaces of human bodies loomed a libido of handsome filth.
We all loved with lush plasma that had fumes of Angels in it,
coupled together in a package, waiting for lacing that would never come.

ive become stagnant in a way, day to day living. In my youth & social movement class, all we do is yell and call eachother racist. It's all become a blur to me,I don't know what to think or belive in anymore, Everything seems to be a contradiction. Everything. People odn;t realize that we live the struggle, and everyone is board with having and wanting, It's time to move on and stop living a fairy tale i guess.

My love life is a scattered mess of confusion, lust, and an unknowing want that I can't place. I love bois and they don't love me back. It's fine.

I woke up and called Amy because I needed to borrow one of her swim caps, we trekked through the beautiful forest all day and just talked about life, Amy is truly one of the most beautiful people here. I went swimming and came back hyper and excited as possible. Then me and Nicole decided to go to Saturn Cafe for G's B-Day. It was fun and the veggie burger was pretty good, then came the beach. We left Saturn and were headin to the beach when this CAR FROM HELL came hurling at us on East Lorenzo Street on a bridge. The front of it was completely demolished, caving in and charred from a recent fire. Fumes spewing from the engine, it crashed onto the left rail guard, then started heading towards us by making a quick right. We were in the demon car's path of destruction. Luckily Travis sped off fast enough as to barely miss us, it WAS insane. We kept on driving, horrified and scared of what we just saw. Crazy Shit. :]. I saw brokeback on Sat night again which was pretty fun, I <3 Rachel and Ashley, they make everything amazing :]."

No longer easy on the eyes,
   but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below.
   who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for,
  both a beginning and an end. 
But now he lives inside,
  someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on, accident. 
 
And I have learned,
  that even landlocked lovers yearn,
for the sea like navy men.
  Cause now we say goodnight,
from our own separate sides, 
  Like brothers on a hotel bed.

I have grown extremely close to alot of people, mostly individuals, and I havn't joined any established clique or anythin, I think one on one time with a person is the best kind of relationship you can have. period. People are so beautiful when you know them personally, it's in giant groups that people change, for every1 tries to shift their personality to get along with others. So I started swimming, and that is the passion i forgot long ago. Just being in the water and feeling the molecules glide with their curved shape against my skin, it feels like the water is carving my body as I sweat, but don;t sweat in the water. God, water is so beautiful. I miss him alot alot. I ask myself why I love him so much, and It's one of those questions that isn't answerable, I just love him, everything about him I love, I say love because that word is incomprehensible and unexplainible, and since that emotion describes what I feel for Him, then that's what it is I guess... I think I'm going to tell him, and show him poetry, music, and drawings i've dedicated to him. He's so amazing.6:24. I need ot study for my final tomorrow, hehe. I'm writing to Valerie in the journal of peotry she gave me so long ago, I think I will return to sender, because she's really in need of support and standing right now.

The chemistry between Jake and Heith is soo beautiful, they did a REALLY good job capturing that untamed passion and lust between two gay men, Heith being the one that denies being gay, even till the day that his only love Jake dies. Gorgeous movie. I still love Him, and it gives me chills thinkin that i might have to live my life without him. What a lonely existence.

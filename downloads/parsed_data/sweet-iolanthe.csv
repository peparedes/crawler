Lave a comment with the character&rsquo;s name. If you want, you can request pairings or stories about just that one character. Leave a prompt with specific requests if you want to.

But now she was a woman, a shinobi. He meant to tell her off &ndash; nothing good ever came from him, after all, but the pain in his body prevented him from doing so and he hissed as he fell to the ground knee-first. <br /><br />&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Karin managed to ask, face frozen in confusion and terror. <br /><br />Sakura swallowed and turned to Sasuke &ndash; there was nothing she could do for the girl anyway. She needed to gain Sasuke&rsquo;s trust and if it meant letting the girl on the floor, then she had to. Even if it went against her morals as a medic.  &ldquo;I know all of Komoha&rsquo;s secrets. Sasuke-kun, this time, let me help you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He asked.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t hesitate, &ldquo;Because Kakashi is on his way and I can help you escape.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hn.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I can help you. You need me and you don&rsquo;t want to admit it,&rdquo; she said as she walked up to him. Holding her hand out to him, she pleaded, &ldquo;Sasuke.&rdquo;<br /><br />Karin looked bewildered at Sasuke&rsquo;s trust in the newcomer. She felt the girl&rsquo;s eye on her and turned to see her face. Sakura, she thinks she heard Sasuke say, leaned down and whispered to her. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;<br /><br />Karin felt a slight tingle run across her body. The last thing she saw was Sasuke and Sakura running to the West. <br /><br />--//--<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here for the night, she said as she entered the small inn. She had removed her headband and changed her hair color. He admitted he would have liked black on her, but she chose brown for both of them. <br /><br />They started holding hands at some point between crossing the border and forgetting their chosen paths. <br /><br />Once in the bedroom, she sat him down and started tearing at his clothes, looking for his critical injuries first. <br /><br />&ldquo;Why did you come after me?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I already told you why.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because I love you,&rdquo; and he noticed how for the first time there was a hint of regret in her words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done healing you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t. Everyone who loves me dies. Itachi &ndash; he loved and I killed him. But he <em>loved </em>&ndash; he loved me and died because of me,&rdquo; he had never sounded so mortified. <br /><br />&ldquo;I know. I read everything.&rdquo; His questioning gaze made Sakura confess her discovery of the massacre and the Council&rsquo;s lies. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;<br /><br />That&rsquo;s when Sasuke pulled her to him; meeting in a silent sigh. Neither of them thought of the past or their 12-year-old selves. Sasuke took his time in exploring this new woman willing to do anything to save him again. It&rsquo;s unexpected, but Sakura allowed him to take control.<br /><br />Sakura felt fine then, or so she thought. At least, his kisses made her forget what was to come. Sakura placed her hand over his heart and looked up at him, &ldquo;Everything will be alright, now Sasuke-kun. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Without a second thought, she pushed him to the bed and took off her shirt. It was getting tougher having to control her gasps. &ldquo;Do you  -- are you okay with this?&rdquo;<br /><br />Sasuke gulped as he nodded and if it was any other situation, she might have laughed.<br /><br />She pressed her lips harder against him in an attempt to control herself. Sakura wondered if Sasuke could feel the desperation or maybe mistook it as his own. Either way, they didn&rsquo;t care as the moved against each other. She kissed her way up to his ear and whispered promises to him.<br /><br />&ldquo;I will never leaver you &ndash; <em>never</em>.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sakura removed the rest of his clothes, along with her pants. She looked back at Sasuke to make sure things were alright, but he only smirked and flipped them over. &ldquo;Hn.&rdquo;<br /><br />Without further notice, he entered her in one swift motion. Sakura moaned and it made Sasuke worry if it had been from pain or pleasure, but when he moved again, she closed her eyes and pulled him closer &ndash; her legs pressing his buttocks. It had definitely been pleasure. <br /><br />In all their clumsiness, they found each other&rsquo;s hands. Never had they ever felt closer to life than at that instant when they held each other. <br /><br />Sakura gasped, &ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He said as he bent down to kiss her at the peak of their climax.<br /><br /><em>As it should be.</em><br /><br />--//--<br /><br />&ldquo;Rest now,&rdquo; Sakura told Sasuke as she got up from bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care &ndash; I&rsquo;ll watch out for both of us.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sasuke laid back down and closed his eyes, looking forward to Konoha in the morning. Hours after, Sakura took the courage to lay next to Sasuke. He slept peacefully, not frowning or with caution as he had when they were genin. He trusted her now. <br /><br />She clamped her hand over her mouth to stop her sobs. No use crying now, she told herself, things had to be done. Using her fingertips, she hovered over Sasuke&rsquo;s chest, not knowing where to start. Her determination and love took the better part of her, and her fingertips pressed against his heart. The green glow was the only light in the room. Sasuke slept quietly as Sakura controlled his circulation and then, just like war, there was no light. <br /><br />--//--<br /><br />Kakashi found her crying on the bathroom floor. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span><span class=""ljuser ljuser-name_itsgametime"" lj:user=""itsgametime"" style=""white-space: nowrap;""><a href=""http://itsgametime.livejournal.com/profile""><span style=""font-size: larger; ""><img alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></span></a><a href=""http://itsgametime.livejournal.com/""><span style=""font-size: larger; ""><b>itsgametime</b></span></a></span><span style=""font-size: larger; "">&nbsp;;; see how I gave clues throughout the story of what she was gonna do?!

I don't think Mill would consider the Health Care Bill as a success. I think he wouldn't like it at all. He might argue that it's a way for governments to set limits to people because they would, in a way, depend on government. I think that because Mill believes in individualism, he would rather have people personally take their private insurance. I might be wrong.

So. Class reaction:

The Article we had to read for class: written in a Conservative Think Tank. Thoughts? Why would they do that? Perhaps it's a way of affirm their believes? Je ne sais pas. Also, Burke would approve. He's argue that it's okay to take advantage of people because there are smarter folks out there that need to rule the other citizens. Oh, Tradition, Burke approves.

"event","In this part, I read more into the reasons of Burke's dislike of the French Revolution or any revolution. 

He writes, with much dislike, how a revolution against the state is an act of liberty. In all honesty, he believes that even the talks of starting a revolution, destroys the people's security and welfare. He associates it with taking periodical doses of mercury and &quot;swallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides&quot; (101).&nbsp; This man has an intense dislike of revolutions. It makes sense, though, that he preferred the American Revolution because they did fight for more liberty, and perhaps because they, in a way, tried to maintain a way of tradition. The tradition to Americans would have been living without taxation, maintaining their liberal ideologies of the market and of the state they wanted to form."

"event","<strong>Q: Why is Burke considered the father of Conservatism?</strong><br /><br /><em>My response:</em> I believe he valued the idea of the state and the leader to be all supreme and powerful (also a reason why he disliked the French Revolution -- peasants killed their nobles). There is also a quote where he believes succession to be one of the most valuable acts a kingdom or state could follow. (Note: it seems very familiar to the Mandate of Heaven in Chinese Dynasties). With succession, it reassured who would be leader and no one would want to fight against that right. Also, succession of power would guarantee the support of the people if the previous leader served their state. <br /><br /><br />We also discussed that <ul><li>He was likely to be considered the Father of Conservatism because Conservatists likely believed in systems that were already in place, ie. a monarchy.</li><li>Moral attitude! He believed in an organic way of life being a critical part to community and self. </li><li>The concept of individual was foolish. One needed to preserve tradition overall and stay away from irrationality. This also links back to the idea his concepts were similar to the Mandate of Heaven and Confucian ideology. He could've studied Chinese ideologies, maybe. </li></ul><br /><br />"

"event","I shall use my Marie Antoinette icon in honor of Burke and his love for the French Revolution. :D

He really did not like the French Revolution for they went against the well constructed state Burke argues France had. Although it would appear that he disliked all sorts of revolutions against a formed state, Burke only seems to object against the French Revolution. We find in the articles that he did approve and support the American Revolution. After reading the first parts, I think he approved of the American Revolution because they wanted to form their own state. Great Britain would not want to secure all of their colonies, hence the Americans would have a justification to revolt."

Community be over self interest, he says.</li><li>The Majestry (government) reinforces laws while sovereign - the people - make laws. </li><li>City-states would be more beneficial and easier to governed than large territories since it means a small community that not only shares a region but culture, economics among some other things. I think it would make better sense, and it does imply that the United States cannot run their politics with a community-base background as much&nbsp; since we are such a big nation. I'm not suggesting that the United States should not be so big, it does have its benefits.

"event","There's an artificial body of government, meaning that Rousseau actually addresses the fact that government is a theoretical thought, not something solid that one can hold. Therefore, Rousseau addresses the fact that because the government is made up of representatives chosen by people. I like the fact that Rousseau sees and raises awareness to the fact that people might not follow up on their government after they have already chosen their representatives since they just leave it to them to handle their rights. Although, I'm not the best example, we can really see that people have taken their right to participate in governments and left them in Washington. We should really take up to Rousseau and continue our work as citizens.

Then again, if we do have the privilege to vote if we want to, why even bother, correct? Sometimes I believe we do have to go out there and participate. It is essential to our every day life style because every day we are faced with things that can affect us if we hadn't taken that action. I shouldn't compare it to Peruvian politics -- the fact that they fine those who don't vote -- but sometimes it would be a good act, a legitimate act to have everyone vote. Even though we imagine people would vote for their desired leader, do we really believe they are? It might not change anything at the beginning; people might still vote for the lesser of two evils. Or they might not."

The state has the right and needs to take care of the people. According to Rousseau, the State becomes master of all good, meaning that it has the obligation to take care of their people and of their liberties. There's also something mentioned about the &quot;first occupier&quot;. I don't really follow Rousseau on this as I'm not sure if he's talking about citizenship or not. If he is, however, then it implies that there should be right to those citizens that the government needs to fulfill. 

Book II. 

Something that caught my attention more than anything else was Rousseau's Sec 5 - The Right to Life and Death.
It's incredible how something from the past can still have its effects today and I'm not being sarcastic or anything this time. In all honesty, it is something more than brilliant that when Rousseau writes about the state also having the decision to someone's life we still see it today. For instance, if the police catches someone about to commit suicide, then it becomes the federal or state obligation to stop said act and actually punish someone with a fine (or something else) for attempting murder on one's own self, or property. It is because of the social contract that the state needs to protect such life. 

I also like the fact that he does not believe in the death penalty as it would turn the state to murderer too. Anyone really who attacks the rights of people become or should be seen as committing a crime. Then again, not everyone followed or actually paid much attention to this when slavery was advocated."

Of course majority rules because we see who represents the majority and we can find a white man. It's funny how things created hundreds of years ago could still be in effect today and while the history geek in me would become fascinated by it, the political scientist cannot helped but be repulsed by this particular idea. Majority still rules even if it's just 40% of the population making a decision every 4 years. Do we look back and even see at the minority and who they have voted for? No. In our Houses, do we often hear the minority voice? No. Sometimes I think the best way to look at the minority is though a parliamentary order, but that's not often the answer. Sometimes the electoral college is not the answer. But go ahead, let's continue to listen to that majority, yeah?<br /><br /><br />Take-Aways from Hobbes:<br />1. Censorship good. As long as it is for safety and security!<br />2. Cooperation vs. competition<br />3. Freedom in civil societies depends on silence of the laws. <br />4. Monarchy best rule because of competition! But consistency key!<br /><br />Let's take #3. <br />To Hobbes, laws really take away freedom because if there isn't a law that tells me I cannot kill my neighbor, then really, I am free to do it. Hence, as laws are created we are limited to the freedom we have. <br /><br /><strong>Funny stories:<br /></strong>1. If 6 females live together in NY it is consider a brothel. These laws surely gender individuals. <br />2. If you live in a public housing, you can start saying goodbye to your rights.

"event","Oh, Hobbes, what you do to my mind. 

I wasn't sure, but I am certain that he goes back to this idea of religion and curiosity in order to legitimize his argument of the state of men, the natural law. He argues that they should be followed because they have, in fact, mandated by God. Therefore, the first founders of the Commonwealth, as they keep people in &quot;obedience and peace&quot; should know that their laws are easily received. We can tell this to the man whose rights to liberty have been taking away and created of him, a subject to rule over. You go, Hobbes. 

I did get confused in chapter XIV, though. When he wrote &quot;To lay down a man's right to anything is to divert himself of the liberty of hinderig another of the benefit of his own right to do the same&quot;.

?

Do you mean that to take away someone's liberty is to take away someone else liberty to do the same? I don't know if he means that I cannot take person A's liberty because person A cannot take person B's liberty or that if I take person A's liberty, it would set an example to not take person B's liberty because we see the consequences? Obviously, it cannot be either since we did both during slavery."

For instance, he would not like the person who does not work or fight for a higher position in a job or work in general. In this commonwealth, he argues for everyone to do something with their lives, really, argues that they need to move and work within this society. Even schools need to become part of this wave he argues for, but never to fool scholars on God's teachings or the way we conceive him. 

He also believes that discourse and diction are critical aspects of life. If a man that notices a difference or is critical of certain points, without words to make the argument, it really becomes hard (IV). Of all the discourse and ways we could use, the most influential and important is that of knowledge.

Also, the many different passions men have lead him to making mistakes or goodness. If there is pleasure from what someone does, then it legitimizes that action. So, according to him, if I feel pleasure from cheating on my husband, even if I hurt someone, I could still be doing something moral because it is to my own goodness, my own benefit. It sounds very ignorant of other people's feelings. In a way, it legitimizes actions such as over working people in order to create my own desired profit."

The United States cannot risk deaths, nor can Iran.<br /><br /><br />Machiavelli on Obama<br /><br />I agree with other students in that Machiavelli would not be so pleased with Obama's regulations now, maybe only with the fact that he has not kept any promises yet. However, Obama is playing a safe field, in Machiavelli's opinion, not really using fear as a tactic or creating nationalist forces (maybe his campaign could have been a nationalist movement, something to love him for, according to Machiavelli). <br /><br />In fact, I believe he would've loved the Bush administration because they took the disaster of 9/11 as a benefit for their office. Bush got to create the fear in people, convince us that we needed national security at all costs, hence the PATRIOT ACT and also created Nationalistic rhetoric. We <em>needed </em>to fight against terrorism, as a union, a country. Militarism might have been the strongest then than in other period of time. People were convinced the military was the best thing in the world, even if it created wars or prejudices within that same military against women, gays and lesbians.

Calvin seems to argue in a pessimistic way about people as well, however, he argues that there is no salvation for the sinners since they are already doomed to sin; he believes in predesitined sets of life. If you are already doomed to sin, then there is no salvation, hence no fear that those not doomed to sin would fall under sin. It seems unrealistic when discussing it now, and people might still believe it, but it just doesn't make sense. If I am tempted to sin, I might sin. I think there are two roads to life and people have the option of which to take. In law form, this would mean that everyone does not really need to follow the laws because some people are already pred-destined to not follow them. In fact, he would probably argue that having a police enforcement is not that all necessary other than capturing the criminals after they have already committed the sin. No need to prevent it."

Therefore, these are necessary in order to have a well governed community. Even though we are rational in what laws should be, we still need scriptures in order to be civilized, like any other government.

Therefore, Montesquieu would argue for community building as the critical element in a society. Without a community, then it would be harder to follow moral rules if there is no sense of union. It depends on the community to create these rules that would later on affect them. However, this did not mean that only one power should be able to enforce the laws or make the laws. In fact, Montesquieu argued for checks and balances, the same we have in the United States. Community building was good, but they had to check within each other in order to strengthen that community and not have any risks of one overpowering the other. 

Therefore, the Spirit of the Law was a key element to Montesquieu. One had to believe&nbsp; in that law, the fact that something should be respected and followed as it would increase moral action as well."

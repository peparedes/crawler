"event","so much has happened since the last time i wrote in my journal. OH and i want to thank all the people that write comments to me, i really appreciate it. Well i have been keeping myself busy,and have made some kool friends along the way. At work  theirs a dude named mike, he is so kool, hes very nice and flirts alot, buts it all good, hehe. Hes a christaian and has a lot of morals and values. Well i think hes adorable, but thats another story i will tell , later. Im doing great in my math 71 class. getting 'A's on mt tests, actually i have one more test and then the final, and im done with the class. Im still thinking twice about taking trig next semester tho. Well i wanted to let my peeps know about the 411 on my crush, hes still on my mind. But we dont talk anymore, its one of those situations in life where you can only dream. It was never meant to be. Hey,i have to say it hurts to know he wont like me. BUt on the positive out look it was an awesome feeling to like him, haha. BUt only i would understand that, its all good. Well the other day I was looking at prom dresses, and i think i found my prom dress. Wow its pretty, and i cant wait to try it on. And i was also thinking about my prom date. I would like to ask my friend mike, but then again, unfortunately i have to get permission from my mother. Oh my mom, she is an interesting creature, but i love her tho. Man i am so glad i dont feel sad, i know why and for once i have found my happiness, and that is in me. Also in GOD, but i have learned to change my perspective in life, to see the positive outlook of things, and it will get better for me. I also wanted to say, i think i made a new friend, her name is michelle, but hey you never know, friends come and go, but she is really kool and i like her as a friend. I wanted to share with the women  and girls out their, that if you ever feel in need of a guy, just think first about your moral and values and for what is best for you, not only what you think will feel good. As human beings we make many mistakes, and sometimes what we think is right can be hurtful and wrong to us. I speak form experience, and if i was asked to say one thing to the girls out there sufferring or wanting a boyfriend, i would tell them. wait, be patient, make friends, get to know people, find your self first, because the day you love yourself, is the day you will understand true love. You are the only person that can give a tight hug to yourself when ever you want, when ever u want. And the best part of loveing yourself is it will be easy to love others. And you will find that prince charming, let time tell. I have to say the hardest part of growing up is being patient with time and with lifes situations, but it pays off. And the coolest part of being patient is you look younger, haha, because you are not always in a hurry, you are aware things needs to be done so you just take responsibilty, you simplify your life. Which i have to say is super imporatnt. One more thing to the beautiful girls out there,you are worth it, and GOD loves you, for we are all his children and a miralce on this planet. ANd this is my voice speaking no one elses. ANd dont be lead into temption, please dont, because one hour of pleasure can be a lifetime of misery. remember love yourself, for you are your own best friend, and you are the only person that understand you better than anyone."

"event","well, anyone that reads my live journals know how i feel about my crush. well i let you in on a event that just occurred. We all know school is over now, and its summer, and summer is the time to have fun and enjoy our old friends and just kinda do things we just dont usually do. well i went online acouple of days ago, to just catch up on my firends lives. Then guess who instant messages me. My crush willy, well i didnt think to much of it, i just kinda thought well he has no one else to talk to.  we talked for a long time. He brought up the aloha dance. ANd i told him how good he looked and he said i looked good (riight) well after a while he said something that really grabbed my attention, he said he had an interest in me. And that he really felt like an ass for not giving me a chance. Well i was speechless and i didnt know what to say. He then asked me if i liked him. ( between all my friends who are reading this, i like him alot, alot,sometimes i think i love, but haha, i dont even know what love is) well he asked me and i responded in a different manner this time. I told him that i cant say yes because i will feel as if im giving myself away, and that you wont do anything about it. and if i say no, then  its a lie. NOw do you see my confususion.

Well now i feel bad because the day after, i went online again and we talked, well when we talked it got intimate and then i had to sign off, and i just hope he doesnt think i was mad or something, becasue i never sign off when we expresses so much of what our feelings might mean. I hope hes not mad. oh well, all i know is im confused as a booger. and i think about him alot. because i believe him when he says he has an interst in me, but i dont want to because im afraid of hurting myself. i dont know, i just feel that both of our priorities in life are different, very different. im just plain confused. and if any of my closest peeps are reading this i am really asking for advice, and want to know what you would do if you were in my position. Just so you remember my situation, i will give a lil background. I like a senior dood, and he knows i like him because i told him, and i continously approached him and try to just be his friend. but because of whatever reason, it didnt work. he never responded. now that its summer time he is bringing it up again and saying that he has an interst in me. what would you do if you had veronica's personality, and just wanted the best for yourself?"

"event","Wow i feel great, im relaxed and loving every moment of life. Im telling you im a moody person. Everyday its a differnt feeling , but i need to make it a habit to feel loved everyday, because i am loved by GOd and my wonderful family. See i realized something important, love comes from within. We have the chioce to feel loved. What i mean is if we take the time to see all the love that is around us, life is beautiful. The fact i am alive invloves love. My mom loves me and took care of me for 16 years. That such a  powerful and awesome love. See life is beautiful the day we see the beauty of it.I dont know why i see the wants of life becasue i am such a valuable person i dont want a man or materialism to make me happy. Only the love of my family, friends and GOd. The rest will come later in life, through its own time. I have slowly come to admire myself. I have so much to offer to my loved ones. I care for them like no one can. I care for others with love. Right now i have a new guy friend, and he is a really funny guy, can act stupid sometimes, very childish, and its a compliment. He has an issue right now with his parents, they are going to get a divorce and he feels awkward i heard it in his tone of voice. But he wouldnt admit it. Oh and i wanted to mention after we talked today about his issues and then mine i started realizing i need to be grateful; cause there are no real pains in my life at this very moment. Only that boy i cant stop thinking about, but that pain is extraneous, im doing it to myself for no reason. hahahhaha, i laugh at the times i cryed and actually wanted him. Not realizing that my want is hurting me. Wow im glad i realized soon, becasue the thoughts of him are wasteing my time. You wanna know what my thoughts were, i created a perfect romance inside my mind. I honestly felt i could have him. Maybe i could of, but it wouldnt be real, and it would of hurted MORE if i had him and lost him because he wouldnt understand my love, if i ever showed him. I dont know if im making sense, but all that matters is that it makes sense to me, and im proud of myself. I just hope i stay  content and appreciating everythin other than seeing the bad side of things. I enjoy writing it feels good, and to think  i hated it. I have alot of things to do like study for the ACT and SAT and get ready for work tomorrow and then do CHemistry of crime and start on that law paper because i am short on time and it is flying for me. WOw im going to be a successful person and it feels good to know i have dreams and im capable of reaching them. And william was an infactuation, more on the border of an obsessional need. I admit i was obsessed and it is slowwly diminishing from my heart. Thats why im proud of myself. g2g. God bless you All and if you ever need to be heard, ask the lord to hear you, he will love to. Just ask him he can do wonders. Bye."

"event","I woke up at 7 a.m I was very moody , and i knew why too. I didnt start til'l it was about 7:30. I cried hysterically. I cried for closure. If it doesnt make sense sorry, its for me to understand and others who care to listen. I feel as if im trying to discover something, and during the process im becoming very anxious and impatient and depressed. I recently talked to an elderly women with much expierence, and she clarified to me that how i was acting was very rare in a teenager. And i asked "" how so"". She said that teenagers are to busy trying to fit in, some are trying to discover themselves but give up on the way, but you on the other hand are persistant about your needs. (I came up to this women about ten times this year asking what should i do next with the same situation, (that is slowly becoming absurd.)) I mean i dont even know this women and i give my soul almost twice a month to her. But the awesome outcome of it is she makes me feel that i do know what im doing and makes me realize that time will tell. I have read about patience several times in my life but the question is have i applyed it to my daily life. The honest truth is no. Well in certain aspects of my life i have. Like with my mom, wow, i broke the record of patience, now i understand my mom more and i dont see her critical ways of being as such a burden. I just realize its her UNIQUE way of saying she loves us and cares for us and doesnt want us to get hurt. But my mom only knows half the story about my life. I tell my mom enough for her to know im okay, but really im  just confused and feeling so much emotions. Recently i analyzed why i felt i needed william so much, its because i see him as the person that can give me what i need. Let me clarify, i dont have a father figure in my life. And i dont need one, what i need is the love a father would give and the love i would give in return. I felt for the longest time that william can help me with my need.  Not realizing that he doesnt understand my need, I mean i dont even understand my need, but still im going after him thinking that one day he will see me as a friend and maybe i might understand why i chose him to fulfill my need. In peer counseling class i was asked to express how i feel. (Do yourself a favor, don't ever ask me how i feel when you see me pensive, becasue i will tell you.) Well i told a bunch of starangers how i felt and i said so much that half the calss was almost crying. Well hey ,they got a piece of my medicine. They probably didnt undertsnd but they sure felt it. The good thing is im calm right now becasue i feel God is with and i just pray and wish that i put him as my priority, Because GOd can be my father and the love i've been longing for.  Whats funny is i can't admit that i need that love but i feel it so much. and you wanna knows what the coolest thing about Gods love, it last forever. And im going to start taking iniatative to love GOd and go after god. Becasue i know for sure he will return love. NOt like other humans, shoot, you give so much and they don't even appreciate. And watch when they lose that love they finally figure out, "" oh i needed that."" well life is interesting and im going to continue being strong. I love myself, i just realized i need to tell myself more often. I need not be so hard on myself because im GOd's creation and he has formed me to be lovable, caring and strong. I will be leaving now to my bed. My eyes are slowly closing and i have repeated 'Drowning "" by BSB since i began writing. haha, watch im probaly going to sing in my sleep. That all i need. BYe and rememebr Gods is always there, just call him and tell him you need him, he will come."

"event","I chose that i am in a contemplative mood because i didnt know what other word to pick for how i ma feeling right now. It intersting how when we are feeling someting for something its alot of feeling at once. Its never just ONE feeling. YOu should think about it sometime. Like for example when you are feeling streessed ,you also might be feeling sad and frustrated. You are not just stressed. I had a chat with my mom yesterday. We talked about habits and change. Everyday we learn something new. We dont think we do but we do. Well i beleive i learn something new every hour i have a busyt schedule. ANd i have learn so much more then when i was bored and sleeeping at home procastinating. I recently have been changing for the better and i am really proud of myself for that. Last month i was worried about learning enough for the SAT, today ium taking action and practicing, i have over come my worry of Sat phobia. My life is awesome. I have an extraordinary mom who alwasy gives me advice and guidance, you dont know how much i appreciate that. I mean i dont even get angry anymore when she critricizes me because i shifted my paradigm to see her criticism as  advice. I finished work today at 5. IT was alot to do, but im glad time flew. Man i just feel like i dont know, it hard to explain. i wish i could just walk and not care about where im going or if there any danger ahead. I honestly wosh in can do that atr this very moment. Dont get me worng im not sad or depressed i just feel like doing domething differnt. Tomorrw is sunday. I alreqady know how my day will go. I will wake up early, look to see if clothes need to be washed , then i will make breakfeast, the i will head to my room and beging my homework. I already know what homework assignment i am going to start with. Peer counseling , mnath then hamlet. After thereading logs im going to work on some physics. Then i need to fill out the ACT and SAT appliocations. Man is it a goodnthing to be this way. i feel, hehe alot of thinngs, like i said i cnat ever just feel one feeling. I have to feel all. hahha. im just a feeling person. well bye and thanks fpr listening , i needed to be heard today. i felt alone. that word i was looking for alone."

"event","Life is interesting one day you feel alive as if everything is beautiful and another day you feel gloomy telling yourself "" why does everything always happen to me"". I learned something today , the word obsequious, which means to show affection. I thought about this word alot and when i come to think about it im an obsequious person. I constanly show to much affection towards others and they dont appreciate it. No worse, they don;t realize that im being affectionate. It crazy how in life you have to prove yourself to feel belonged. It shouldnt have to be that way becasue we are all unique and i honestly feel everyhuman being should learn to appreciate others for their uniqueness. I know that my words might seem vague to the ignorant, but us wise people see the importance of my message. My life is very intersting, i have afrugal mom, who constanly watches how she spends her money, but the irony behind that is she later goes and gives my sister whatever she wants. how veneer people can be. I have a best friend and her name is yelena. Now i have to say she is very imporatnt to me. As well as my family. I contiuosly show my love appreciation to these signifanct people in my life. And at any point if they dont appreaciate my love i would feel very hurt and they would know that im hurt cause i would give them a piece of my mind. The life we live is very simple if you think about it, the reason we view it as being difficult is becasue we think it is. When you think you can or cannot do something you are right. I have heard several wise people say you are what you think, but im confused, what about all those people out there who don't think. Well then they are noting but their reactions. The point is reactions control many of the people in this society, when we get angry the first thing that comes to our mind is revenge , We dont tell ourselves but our acid in our stomachs feels it. Its important to think during situations where a person would usually react. Theres a saying that goes some what like this , when you are feeling frustrated ask yourself what that person is teaching you other than why are they bugging me. I agree a lot with this saying  and it has changed the way i view things now."

"event","Today i realized something life is such a routine. Everyday we go to school or work to be somebody. SOme people enjoy it some do not. But the ones who do not enjoy see it as a sacrifice. They wake up knowing theres is nothing beter for them. I know someone like this. It gets me depressed to see this person act this way. Becasue life has so much more to offer it only work. We can make the chioce as individuals and change our way of thinking. Many times i tell myuself, "" hey one of these day i will look back at all this and laugh at it"" but the wise thing to do is laugh at it no because i will get over it faster. Many this person has fear of change. For the reason everytime she has been exposed to change it has led her to pain. She doesnt view change a s a good thing.  I believe that the day she shifts her pardigm of life she will see  light shining form her dark gloomy tunnel. I love this person with all my heart and it hurts to see her think in such a poor manner. It not getting her anywhere only to more frustration. But what hets me even more upset is she doesnt realize all that she has done as a perosn. GOd has always been there for us, always and this perosn is constanly saying god is not. We are the dumb humans that chose to act the way we do. Nothing is of Gods act. Life is fool of people blaming others for their actions. Cant every individula for once just be honest with themselves. If you took the time to realize that you can make mistakes and that your not always right and trhat advice can help you ALOT, t5hen life wont be so dark and close minded as you see it. As people standing on earth we must learn to understand self awareness, i cannot streess enough the fact that people do not see the impoirtance of loveing yourself. This person that i love does not see what she has to offer. She is to busy seeing what has not done yet or when will i pay the next bill. Money is not everyting. Learn to love yourlsef and you will find wiser ways to things becasue you will see more things in life other than just kids, bills and death. I have talkes to several wise people in my life time and i have noticed that they have all had their times when they had alow self esteem and felt their was no way out. Now they back on their feet , feeling the real mening of life, Happiness. But what i dont underatnd is how all the other people see this but dont apply it. I critize becasue of frustration Please if any one is reading this do not get offended by my words but in our world today we have alot of low life people. They dont see the tru meaning of life becasue they are to busy seeing the dollar signs.  I'm upset with something that happened today. Let me tell you something about myself i'm known to be a very nice person. Exuse me , let me rephrase that, im known to be taken advatage off. O dont believe i have low self esteem but man people sure know how to manipulate me to get what they want. An what suxs the most is i dont see it as manipulation , im to busy acting naive and stupid that i honestly thinf they are my friends. I feel better now tomorrow is another glorious day. I sat glorious because i envision God everyday being with me. I'm goign to laugh tomorrow at all the things that made me sad. Actually i'm laughing rite now becasue my life is to valuable to be focusing on negativity. Don't get me wrong negativity helps p[eople realize but its not everytinh. You can make a chose to change your persepective of life and the way you do things. Thanks for your time. God bless you."

"event","I begin working. And i be gan changing. Im a differnt person now becuase i take more in to account hwat good for me. If that makes sense. I enjoy listening to ppl. They dont enjoy listeng to me. I sometimes think to myself "" I give more more of my love and understanding to others"" and sometimes ppol treat me like caca and i just say ""hay that life and its there lose. I have a really kool friend named yelena. You always listends to me. Im suprised she still likes me as a freind. Im not trying to sound l;ike a victim or like a person who doesnt appreciate but i want to sound like a person concerned with why things happen to me. Maybe because i allow them to happen to me. And if anybody is reading this rite now you are probably very confused on my what i am trying to say. I have a tendency to go around in cirlces when expressing. Like with william. Oh man that dude is cute. But why cant i get over him? Maybe i am over him but it just feels good to think about him. He very sweet. Alot of girls that know him thinks so too. If i had one wish i would wish to talk to guys more. Any guy including william. Just to understand their perspective of things becuase maybe if i do i wont feel i have to react rite away to feelings. But the imp[ortant thing is i learned my lessen ( the hard way) and i wont make that mistake again. well i have to go now and finish a utopian paper that due. bye."

Well i saw him again today, wow he looks good. Well there's one thing i need to realize, is that he has no feelings for me, that suxs, but thats reality. I say he doesnt have feelings for me because he knows i like him and i told him, but still he wont tell me anything. why do i do this to myself. Okay i been through worse things in life. Man why havent i learned my lessen. Today i also saw sal. I mentions this because i noticed him looking very sad. Well i hope everything is okay with him and and his girlfriend. Man i need to focus more and read more, maybe if i keep myself busy i wont feel so bad. heheh. there i go again im allowing myself to feel this way, oh goodness. "" crazy for this girl"" thats the song im listening to rite now. well i gave my message to william and i feel he should give me his, even if he doesnt have feeling for me, i want him to tell me. Okay veronica listen to yourself. You already got the message, the fact that he doesn't talk to u is saying, "" leave me alone, i dont like you that way."" okay i answered my own question. Lol.

I have alot on my mind. School gets busier by the day. Hard work pays off. I prayed today, that i can understand why i feel so much for a boy who i hardly know, and that hardly knows me. But seriously if you look at him hes differnt, its hard to explain. But i love his eyes, wow his eyes are nice. very nice. What sucks the most william is that i have no idea what he is feeling? he doesnt have to like me, i can see him as a freind. But man, i would not mind being his girlfreind. lol. But hey, what can i do, when the man of your dreams doesnt care about how u feel, then maybe he not really the man of my dreams? i noticed that i have been feeling more capable of handling things. Like being able to focus when it time to homework, i know it sounds absurd, but it means alot to me. So does william. Wow, everytime i see him i smile hehe. And im mad at myself for one thing, i tell people about my feelings and all they tell me is "" your to good for him."" I dont know wut to do, i tell myself to just leave it alone. well i g2g now. bye =("

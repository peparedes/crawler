"event","So I went back to school.And it was boring.But whatever.So Thursday was ugly.Then Friday,I ended up not going in cause I would have been late.So I went out with Paul and Lindz and watched tv and stuff at Lindz's house.It was fun,to the extent that anything at Lindz's house is amusing.When we left,me and Paul went to his house,and bought a bunch of weed of his brothers.And smoked a large quantity that night.Twas fun kinda.The next day,we slept in quite a bit,and by the time I was ready to leave and such,it was like 6pm.Now that was my mother's birthday.So I got home,and Steph called and bitched at me cause I promised her I'd hang out with her...(like I'd really hang out with her before supper though?) and she got pissed cause I slept at Paul's.I swear it could have been anything else and she wouldnt have cared,but if I mention Paul's name she goes ballistic.So anyways I ended up not going out with them cause my family guilt tripped me bout it being my mom's birthday.So Robyn had told me that this band we really liked that opened for the Rasmus  were coming back,but then I found out it was the same day as my mom's birthday.and it was 18+ so I couldnt get in.So today I'm not doing anything with Paul like I could be cause Steph and Jen went on about how I spend too much time with him,etc,and that since I couldnt go out yesterday,I had to do something with them today.But I really dont want to.Goddamit.So then I go on MSN cause im bored waiting for them to call and Robyn starts going on bout how she met Money Money,and she had pics with them,and shes keeping contact with em by email.Made my day.So today's quite ugly."

"event","So the last week to school has gone by really fast.*sigh*.Makes me sad.I have tomorrow and then it's over.So all this week I've been pretty much...doing randomness.Hung out with Paul a LOT,but I managed to hang out with Steph Mike n Deidre once,to go see Darkness.I hung out with Shylo and Jen right after that.But like I mentioned,most of it was spent at Paul's.And I just...feel like I'm there too much.So I dont know what I'm doing for my last day,but I dont think I'll call Paul.I really dont wanna go back to school,but well,that's life I guess.Short entry I know,but whatever.Later."

"event","So the new year.Fun stuff huh?Half right.The first half of the day went pretty badly.Robyn came up to me and bitched about a conversation I had with John about her.Apparently John's been twisting my words around to start shit.So me and Robyn had a dramatic little thinger,which ended in her saying how I'm ALWAYS gossipping about her,etc.Cause I just have Nothing better to do with my time.So anyways When I got away from that,I headed out to Paul's.So we hung out for a bit,then we went over to Lynd-z's house.We recognized the house by the garage door,which was open and emitting weed smelling smoke.haha.So we walked in,and I had money for alcohol and food,but Lynd-z just pulled out all this hard liquor and was like ""dig in guys"".So I got a little smashed.then Paul went to the bathroom.and we all heard him being sick.and like 2 hours later and a lot of socializing,he was still in there.We felt so bad.So this one guy pulled out a joint.that was like the size of a gigantic cigar.and no tobacco either.this was a BIG mofo.But I only went in when like all the others had finished with it.So there was the owner and me.and the end fell off.quite a bit of weed.So we piped it.so I got kinda drunk and high.Then I had to bring Paul home.Cause he was still massively throwing up.So Lynd-z's dad was gonna drive us to Paul's,but he looked scared to let Paul near his car.So I walked Paul home.He was sick a bit,then we went to bed.Today I stayed there doing like nothing all day.Till like 7.Then I walked home.and have done nothing ever since.Fun huh?"

"event","So it's Christmas Eve.And I got bored so I finally watched Joan of Arc.And it was amazing.But I hate movies like that with people who are that....like devoted to God.Or movies where they make someone out to have a huge destiny.Kinda makes me envious of both.But truth is I dont believe in anything as strongly as that.And I probably dont have much of a destiny either.But movies and such like that kinda make me wish.*sigh*It's sad.It's like I for some reason just got a flash of...self-revelation or something today.I was just thinking about stupidity like 'geez wish I actually was able to say I made a difference' etc,and then it just came to me.How can I make a difference if nobody notices me?Because it's completely true.I've always been kinda antisocial and shy,so my first reaction is to avoid attention.But now I kinda...want to...be different.I know it doesn't make a huge difference,but I just want to be someone who people know,instead of like ""oh that's So and So's friend"".I was like...barely noticed until last year maybe.Then things started changing.I just started to care a little less about what all these people think.But still I'm shy,and antisocial still.But maybe I should change something about that?I dont even know why I'm writing this,it's just...a crackhead moment I guess.But yeah,back to real life and updating.I ended up sleeping at Paul's again yesterday night.And this morning was so freaking embarassing LOL.His brother was at the table so he said something like ""Why dont you just leave?"" as in joking,and I was like ""Oh I sure feel the love in here.""So he looks at me and says ""Hey loverboy,maybe you should pull your zipper up then.What you think is love is probably just a draft."" lmao.I almost died.This is like the second major time I've been really embarassed by Paul's family.haha.That's it for now."

"event","Well it's the holiday of Christmas cheer.Which doesn't normally mean that much to me,but whatever.I did my english exam and finished school for the Christmas holidays yesterday.After that,I went xmas shopping with my friend Jess,who I haven't hung out with in forever.She's awesome.I bought all kinds of stuff,and at the cd store,I bought a CD of one of Jess's fav bands in front of her.Cause I decided to be really nice.And when we separated,I gave it to her.And she was uberhappy,which made me kinda uberhappy.I also bought myself new earrings,just cause I could.Later,I headed to Paul's house.I bought him a Placebo CD(Without You I'm Nothing)and he was happy.After hearing it,I kinda wanted it haha.So we ended up smoking a joint with his brother Merle,and listened to trippy ass Placebo music half the night and I ended up sleeping over.Today I stayed till like 2,then left and I've been sitting around at home ever since.But I'm still in kind of a good mood over xmas shopping.Made me feel a bit excited for christmas.I Love buying gifts for people.Well happy holidays people."

"event","well I have just One day left of school,along with my english exam and its xmas holidays.problem is I still hafta go present shopping with 7 days to go.Shit.I kinda find myself being antisocial lately.Like more than usual too.I can only stand certain people,others I just feel like im gonna snap at them.I still haven't talked to Jen,but now the whole depression over her is slowly dying thankfully.But it's still lonely.But I'll live so whatever.I miss Robyn so much,but I havent had an excuse to see her lately.And I hafta figure out what to get her for xmas.I've invited John to come down sometime after school to do stuff,but he just never shows as usual.So I've given up on his dumb ass.He just annoys me too much.even when I just see him at lunch time in school,it's just like ""how can I get away?""...I dont understand it myself but that's life.So I've basically only been hanging out with Paul and very rarely Evan.I don't get out enough to meet new people,let alone look for anyone special so basically it's stuck this way for a while.I slept at Paul's yesterday and people'll be pleased(or mad) to know we basically spent the whole night getting stoned.Sad but true.Truth to tell,it's gotten kinda boring lately.I mean I love getting stoned sadly,but I just wanna go out and like go see a movie or something.I'll hafta try and call Steph up tomorrow maybe.I kinda miss her.And we've been trying to make plans forever.Well I'm out,later."

"event","Today was so blah.Spanish first was boring,and we actually had a test.Since when do we do work in Spanish?*sigh*...Then in English I finished my English exam portfolio so I have 2 more classes of insane nothingness to look forward to.Woohoo.Economics was boring,and then I got called out of class.I was so scared it was for skipping drama again,but turns out it was just cause I was selling coffee for a fundraiser so they gave me my big box of coffee haha.Then art the teacher gave us detention for not having something I couldnt possibly have done.I was quite mad.Lunch I hung out with Paul and John for a bit,until Paul left.I'm actually really disliking spending much time with John.Wish I'd felt like this last year fuck.French was amusing,talked to random people all class and tried writing Palindromes haha...I came up with a little one about drugs.Talk about original.

Talk about ugly huh?haha.Math was fun as always,and then the day was over.Then I got home to find myself locked out.Wonderful.Then i tried my cousins downstairs to see if i could go through the back and try my backdoor and noone answered.So I tried climbing their back fence,but it was too slippery.Then my cousin came home,let me in,and turns out her mom was home the whole time.Arg.And of course my door was locked.So I waited until my mom got back from whatever she was doing and I went home.And here I am.But what a blah day.Twas quite Haggard.I'm off,byez."

"event","Well this is my first journal entry on LiveJournal so yeah.Let's make this one special.Lately life has been kind of...ick.Not that I have any reason to be all depressed or anything,I'm just....not enjoying life very much right now.But not to like a suicidal degree.Never that.It's just that life just seems to be...repeating itself in the same old boring routines.And the loneliness has really been setting in now that I've basically got no friends.Sure there's Paul,and he's really been great,but I'm sure that he's getting tired of the constant hanging out with me too.Of all my other old 'Best Friends'...John is just...I've started to actually dislike time spent with him.How I ever liked him is beyond my feeble mind.That sounds mean,and it may just be my odd state of mind,but something just bothers me about him now whenever I see him.Shylo I never hang out with anymore,just because all he ever does is go drinking,and I only drink on special occasions.And he's <b>ALWAYS</b> with Jen.And while we're on the topic of Jen.My BEST FRIEND all year...I've never felt as close or as comfortable with one person in my life as I did with Jen.But after a series of fights that just got increasingly stupid and pointless,we just stopped talking.And on her birthday,after I had just made her a card on how we'd stick it through and be friends forever.Talk about Ironic.I think maybe that's bothered me the most,but I wont/can't be the one to go running back,not this time.And Steph is just always mad at me,Or never home to do anything with.But on to other things going on.School is going good cept Drama and Gym,which I've been just not going to cause I can't handle the people in the classes.I managed to buy Paul's brother's classical accoustic guitar off of him for 60$.Score for me lol.But even that doesnt excite me that much now.I need either new friends,a boyfriend,or...something."

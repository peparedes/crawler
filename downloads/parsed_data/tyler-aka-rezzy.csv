"event","Hey Eric and the other two people who read this. My life was kind of hectic plus my Live Journal always screwing up my entries when I accidentally clicked another link I sort of shoved this off to the side but I'll be updating this more often now. A lot of stuff has happened recently which I'll tell everyone about sooner or later. Christmas and New Years was good and I've been keeping myself semi busy with school and acting and life. It's been pretty good. In any case I just thought I'd leave a quick note for you folks and write up something later. probably won't be till this weekend but expect something soon!"

"event","I'll Be making the huge update soon. But for right now sitting here, sick and home from school I decided To Check Eric's LJ. So I see more wedding plans up and for I decide to see how much/long it'll take to get to Wilmore From Edmonton. First I Check the greyhound buses schedule. Unfortunately there's no wilmore destination so i just chose a random destination of Lexington. Dunno how far/close that is to Wilmore but Eric will have to give me the specifics of what major town is closest when i talk to him. Well In any case here's the run down for a round trip bus ride from Edmonton To Lexington(I also guestimated a date of staying at Wilmore for around 3 days or so from August 10-13 not of course the official date just ballparking it so i can get the info):

There's a Depature at 12:15am and it arrives at Lexington at 9:45pm 2 days, 19 hours and 30 minutes later, with 5 Transfers for 324 bucks. Which I think is pretty good but I' ve never done much travelling so I could be off.

I'm still looking around at railway's and flights but so far no luck. In any case just thought I'd waste some time and do this. Huge Update Coming soon!

Anyways I'm off to wallow in my sickness, aka play video games."

<P>Yeah it's been nearly two weeks, but nothing's happened to me in any case. lots of city wide stuff. Last Sunday we had one of the worst storms I've ever seen. We'll it wasn't bad here, but watching the news was insane. here's some news articles to explain the situation. </P>

<P>The largest mall in the world got flooded! people were in the streets canoeing! the underpass's on the freeway were submerged enough to float an RV! the underground parking area was waist deep with water! Golf ball sized hail damaged tons of houses! My area wasn't hit badly at all but a lot people's places were flooded. There was also some random tornado warnings throughout last week. Nothing big.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Saw Eternal Sunshine For the Spotless Mind the 2nd time&nbsp;this week. It was&nbsp;awesome.&nbsp;There's a lot of parts where your like ""why am i watching this"" just because it can get boring, but it's because it's the closest thing to real life on film&nbsp;and&nbsp;real life is boring. but if you stick through it,&nbsp;the absolutely brilliant moments&nbsp;make up for it.</P>
<P>My mom's birthday was last friday, we went and saw the punisher, me seeing it for the 2nd time. I really like it. Also went out for dinner to moxies.</P>
<P>My friend Cooper's 18th birthday was yesterday. We didn't do much. he just bought some movies and we watched some. One being Anything Else, the only one i watched cause i didn't want to make it a late night. It's a woody allen film, that was the second time i've seen it and it's a really great movie. I really love it. </P>
<P>My friend Jen's birthday party was today but due to work couldn't make it. heard it was fun. I'll be dropping by her place on sunday to get her her present. </P>
<P>Beat True Crime on X-box and am working on The Thing and Return to Castle Wolfenstien: Tides of War. It's been keeping me pretty busy.</P>
<P>Good things going down in EG and PM.</P>
<P>Works been Work. Nothing big going down. same ol same ol kinda thing.</P>
<P>Bought Boomtown Season 1 on DVD. Quite Possibly one of my favorite shows that debuted in 2002. It got cut short and ended after the 2nd season cause NBC sucks and doesn't know how to advertise their shows other than reality ones and the put the show on the stupidest days. Sundays and Fridays. both nights when nobody watches TV and no ones at home. Really brilliant. In any case i'm really glad i have it and that's mostly what i've been doing. I'm on Episode 10 right now. Got 9 more to go till i've watched them all. </P>
<P>Well this was a fairly fast and rushed update but like i warned my life has been really dry lately. Just enjoying some me time which i love. I'm not the kind of person that needs to hang out a lot. i really love to spend time alone, and don't take that statement and twist it around and say i'm a loser... cause i'll tell you that myself. but i do enjoy just me at my house. Alright, i'm pretty exhausted. work tomorrow so i'll talk to you guys another time.</P>

"event","I Must be on a streak, two days in a row... pretty hot! as always which means lately, my life will be divided up in little segments:

Work today went by fast, things went pretty good and just busied myself with unimportant carefree tasks for most of the day, was on till for a bit but mostly was on the floor. 
My work schedule's been changed and instead of 6 days a week, around 35 hours, i'll be getting two days a week with 12 hrs a week. They hired another person and it's a small business with only the two managers (husband and wife), Judy a co-worker (awesome person) and me. So in order to fill the new girls' hours they cut mine down a bit which i'm mostly okay with. 
I'm a little worried about it, cash wise, cause there's a ton of good stuff coming out in the next month or so: Prjoect Greenlight Season 2, Boomtown Season 1, Garden State Soundtrack, Hidalgo, Ned Kelly all for DVD and Rainbow Six 3 for X-box. So i'll try to fit that all in and hopefully i'll be able to squeeze in most of that. 

And here's an incident that really got me mad. A couple of days ago a neighbor (sort of she lives across the street and about 4 doors down) was talking to me on MSN. I used to hang out with Gracie (her name) a lot when i was a kid just cause we lived close and my other friend stewart used to live also two doors down. After Junior High I barely saw her and barely kept in touch other than MSN. Well I re-added her to MSN last week and we started talking. I ended up asking her what's she's doing after school since we're both graduating this year and she said she wanted to become a youth pastor. Good stuff, she asks me and i said i'm not to sure yet but God has been helping me out and been pointing me in a few directions mostly acting (don't get me wrong i'm not a cliche hopeful idiot type). Her reply was ""no offense but that almost makes me cry to well hear you say something like that""
That was probably one of the most ignorant things i've ever heard come out of someones mouth... Time for back story. Well her family and her are devoutly christian. Ever since she was young she's been heavily instilled in that stuff. So pretty much a ""holier than though christian"". Which of course the above comment supports. (sorry eric had to take the quote!). And in a probably related coincidence she attends the church that the guy in this story that i posted on Eric's Live journal preaches at. Here's the story: 

One guy came into my store and while i was ringing through his things he asked me ""Are you going to heaven?"" i replied ""Yeah i think so... I Hope so."". Then the preaching began he said ""I am"". That comment really drove me nuts. who's this guy to think that he knows absolutely that he's going to heaven? and has the audicity to actually say that. AHH!!! what a jerk. anyways ""How do you know that?"" i said to him... he hands me a card to the poeple's church, (apparently he was a priest there) close to my house, and said ""If you got nothing better to do sunday morning, come there and i'll tell you"". Then leaves. That conversation really got at me. For multiple reasons, the one i've already stated that he thinks he's all knowing and second is the fact he didn't even bother to ask if i'm a believer in jesus christ. So in any case i did have something better to do that sunday and went to my own church. That's the kind of stuff that gets on my nerves.

Okay, there's the back story lets get caught up. Heavily christian girl haven't talked to in a while makes ignorant comment, random story, ok. Well this gets me really mad. I mean she has barely the faintest clue about my life as it is right now and she makes a comment like that. Well I replied saying: 
""why? i've been going to church since i was a kid, it's nothing new lol"" 


 ""i know that, but just cause you go to church doesn't mean you have a strong thing with God...""

That puts this over the top. Tyler backstory time! I've been going to church since i was a kid, i mean really young, i busted my first tooth there, probably a story i'll share later on because there's been enough stories. I mean, i've had times in my life where i'm feeling distant from god or having a rough time. But Throughout all of it i've always relied on god through all of it. relied probably isn't the greatest word but i'm tired and can't think. could be a good word... not sure... I mean my devotion isn't as strong as hers and it didn't develop as fast but that still gives her no right to pass judgement on my faith. I can understand where she's coming from cause the only time we have talked lately is on MSN and there's some problems with that. 1 is my sense of humor doesn't really convoy my christian side. It's pretty odd. Some of it is pretty sexual and i do tend to take things to far (not physically at all whatsoever people, if you were thinking that just in my jokes). 2 is you can't convey tone very well. i mean whether or not it's a serious or joking tone. so from that information alone i can see why she'd say what she'd say, but she didn't bother to get facts before she opened her mouth.I mean i don't have any problems whatsoever with christians with a strong devout faith, i mean it's what i'm striving towards. but people like that are completely ignorant. Just like the guy in the story he thinks he's more of a follower in christ then me without even bothering if i believe. It doesn't suprise me that she attends the church that he preaches at after that conversation. I mean, handling it the way she did was completely wrong and pretty offensive. It's practically preaching and i hate that. Preaching to someone about religion isn't the way to get them to believe if you get my meaning. Pray for them and hope they find god. She acted like an ignorant christian without even bothering to ask where i am in my life and faith right now. Anyways this is just a rant and i hope it makes sense and that i didn't offend to many people and you get what i'm trying to say. Rants with me aren't very organized so i apologize for that, and it is late. any questions to explain further drop off a comment.

After work today i went to pick up my Klondike day's pass with cooper and jacob. K-days is a travelling amusement park that hits my town every year. I can't wait to go. I'm looking forward to it a ton. After we get the passes we go see anchorman which was hilarious. A great movie with lots of funny parts. I recommend seeing it. 

Anyways, i've gotta start working on some scripts and watch some movies before bed. I don't got church tomorrow cause my dad will be out of town cause my sister has a soccer tournament and my church is on the other side of town so i won't be able to get there. That's it for me..."

"event","Well not much going down today. More Random blurbs about my life below:

Cooper (the friend i auditioned with) went to his callback and he didn't think he did too well. I would have went but i had to work yesterday, which i'll talk about a little more later. In about 10 days he'll be getting a call whether or not he made it. I'm praying the best for him.

Work yesterday was horrible. They only need me there most times so the other person there isn't alone in the store, which leaves me with 6 and 1/2 hours of sheer boredom and doing nothing. I mean i shouldn't be complaining, i am getting paid to do nothing but it still sucks. I'd rather be at home doing nothing. Make matter's worse they called me in early for no reason. They were doing just fine without me. 
The walk there sucked. It was raining, which I love. I'm thinking about moving in a few years, possibly down to the states and i don't know how rainy it gets where i might be moving so i'm gonna miss it. It's been rainy the past few days actually really been loving waking up to the sound of the pitter patter of the rain outside my window. getting back to the point, I took some slips and slides on the way to work cause it was coming down heavy, and by time i got there i was soaked. The only cheer up to the walk is andrew (one of my best friends) walked there with me cause he was bored, so i got to hang out with him before hand. But none the less I survived.

Another work related story, an old friend of mine, Amanda dropped a resume off at my work. Some backstory stuff right.. about... now! i went to elementary with her, and a bit of high school till she dropped out. After junior high her life has been leading more and more away from the clean cut great girl she used to be. She applied in school, had good grades and she was a great person to hang out with. Now she's strung in with a pretty bad crowd, smoking pot and cigarettes. She's gotten into stealing and just a ton of random bad stuff. It really sucks to see where things went with her. Well she dropped off a resume and I she talked with my boss for a while. After she left my boss came up to me and asked me about her since she must have told him that i knew her. Well i thought that a job might get her on track and risked by personal reputation with my bosses and said she was a good person, and reliable. So i pretty much lied to my bosses to help her out. I asked her not to screw things up, so that my faith in her wasn't wrong. Well 2 days later when she comes in to fill out a application she comes in coming off a high and dressed practically in pajamas, not exactly dress to impress attire. The thought of her getting hired in my bosses minds. Plus it made me look bad because i recommended someone that wasn't exactly who i said she was. I'm in a bit of inner turmoil with that whole subject, it was another reason i was so down yesterday.

In more happier news I packed up my x-box and took it over to andrews earlier today and we played through some Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Great fun game and playing through it Co-op style with a friend makes it all the much better. the X-box live on that game is wicked too. 

Also just been keeping myself busy at home with watching master and commander and playing True Crime: Streets of LA.

Today after i got back from andrews i went out for some shopping. My mom's been real bored lately and my dad's been off a lot. The camping thing last week and my sister has a soccer tournament this weekend in a city 2 hours away from here. So she came along with me and we went to west edmonton mall (largest mall in the world by the way! Suckas!). Spent a couple hours there. Went to Eddie bauer and picked up some shirts, picked up two more DVD's. Say Anything and Identity. Was also supposed to meet up with some friends and see a movie while my mom did girl stuff, looking at earrings and what not, but due to insane line ups i couldn't make it. They ended up seeing Fahrenheit 9/11. It was a good thing that i didn't go. The girl that Jacob really liked invited him and cooper to go see it with a bunch of her friends. Well she acted really nasty to him for know reason then ditched  immediately afterwards to a party that they were all supposed to go to. She acted like a complete jerk and jacob is really crushed by the whole thing... that whole situation sucks. Other than that the night went well.

Random News bit: We had a tornado warning for edmonton and the outlying areas today.

And that's about it here. I'm sitting here looking at hte clock thinking i should get to bed because i have work tomorrow morning. I'll probably finish listening to my current playlist (comprised of Paul Brandt, Chris Cummings, Jason McCoy, Montgomery Gentry, Rascal Flatts and Kenny Chesney been in the mood for country a ton lately). So i'll leave things at that and talk to ya guys sometime after weekend or so."

"event","Well The Audition Was Today, Went There Around 1:30 With two of my friends, Chris and Cooper. We gotta fill out a form in a community hall and we're all taking our times cause me and cooper were really nervous. 
We Fill'em Out and the guy takes us to the Workshop West Theatre Across the street. Random small talk ensues, talking about the turn out and for the auditions and how it's a pretty good opportunity. 
We get to the theatre and we all sit down. I'm still filling out my Information sheet Cause i wanted to stall. Well Chris goes in and i'm getting insanely nervous. I barely rehearsed what i was gonna do and it was entirely improvisation. I had a couple ideas in my head but i finally went with a Stand up skit about internet perverts. Saying i'm against it, but really i'm one of them, but i don't consider myself one. 
Chris comes back and he got in! we're both pretty happy for him. Cooper goes in and i'm still thinking about how i'm gonna do it, with small talk to the person out front and chris about how it was and what he did etc. 
Then a little while later Cooper Comes out and he got a Call Back too. So now i gotta raise the bar. It was pretty exciting, both my friends getting in. I finally get called in. I shake the judges hands, saying i'm Tyler, the judges looked real nice. The one girl who i give my information sheet comments about one of my credits and if i met my friend through the commercial that was on there. I said no, and she said she was just kidding and they all laughed at me. 
Well after that i get in front of the camera and she moves me to the mark. She starts rolling and i do what they tell me to do. Say My name age and The Number i had on my chest. Take a puase then start the routine.
Well the time has come. I start in on the routine, talking about how internet's such a problem these days, expecially with all those internet perverts. Random stuff about how just because i'm asking a girl what she's wearing means nothing. I just want to get a better feel for who i'm talking to. And that if i'm wearing no pants that fine cause it's a hot day. More stuff about weird fetishes etc. Well After a lot of shaky delivery i finally get done. The first judge gives me a No. She said she loved my writing style, it was unique in it's irony. They all complimented on my writing style, but no one else said a no or yes. So I took the one no, thanked the judges and left. No Call Back For Tyler. 
But it was a great experience and I had a ton of fun. I wasn't to hung up on the whole thing, but thinking that when this show comes on, knowing i could be on it... Kinda sucks. But i hope my friends do great on their call backs and get into the workshops. After that they start filming in Spring.

Also hung out with Andrew and David the other day, guy's i've known since Elementary. They stopped by and we went for a walk with michelle and cory ended up showing too, all friends. It was good to catch up with them since i've been busy with work and such.

And that about wraps it..."

"event","It's been a while since i updated, mostly cause nothing happens in my life but here's a quick few things:

My grandparents came down for a vist last week, nothing exciting we don't get along to much cause they think i hate them so just the usual bit of visiting then i'm to myself the rest of the two days they were here. 

Almost Done Driver 3, Love the game.

Finished Reading The Last half of Unfinished Tales by Tolkien. I haven't read the silmarillion yet, so i only read from concerning galadriel and celeborn to the end of the book, which covers the 3rd and 4th age, which is stuff i've read in Lord of the Rings. I bought Silmarillion last month and i'm looking forward to reading it, but i'm in the midst of re-reading Two Towers Right Now, here's my Tolkien Filled Outline: Two Towers, Silmarillion, Return of the King, and then the 1st half of Unfinished Tales. I'm so incredibly glad Eric created a LotR RPG, cause if you don't get it, i do have a certain love for Lord of the Rings.

Finished Watching the movies that i bought, all of them were great. I'm currently watching Master And Commander Right Now, my dad bought it so i'll finish that up within the next couple of days.

Saw Spiderman 2 and Napoleon Dynamite with Cooper, Jacob, Chris, Paul, and Jon. Spiderman 2 was awesome, and Napoleon Dynamite was a pretty big let down, wasn't that funny in my opinion. If you've never heard of it, it's a small indie film about a typical high school geek struggling to get through life kinda thing.

It was just me and mom home alone since wednesday. My dad and sis went off to The yearly family camp out where all the family and extended family gets together. it's a pretty big group. My grandma had 7 kids, all my aunts and uncles, then things get bigger from there. It's always nice, and i missed going this year due to the fact that the other girl at my work wanted that weekend off to and i didn't want to leave my bosses all alone so i decided to stay here. Me and my mom went out for dinner twice, moxies and pita pit and i saw her Scooby Doo 2 with her as well. It was a nice relaxing time. 

The audition for the TV show is tomorrow and i'm getting a bit freaked out, i don't have anything actually in stone or down pact for the 2 minute skit i gotta do. So hopefully something comes to me soon. God's really been pointing a lot in this whole acting direction lately, a lot of stuff popping out of the blue so i'm hoping he's telling me something cause i have no idea what i want to do with the rest of my life. It'd be awesome if something came out of this in any case.

Helping Chris out with a fight In PM right now.

And that's about it, nothing big went down in the last week. kind of dull, but there's Tyler's world for ya. Check back with you guys soon and i'll let ya know how hte audition went."

"event","Well here we go. It's been a while cause i've been pretty busy. After my final exam there was the three days of work i talked about which was probably the most boring 20 hrs of my life. Thursday was alright, semi boring. Got home and played some Driver 3, which i'm really liking by the way. Friday, i gotta be in by 1. Well friday my bosses had a pre wedding party to go to, so after Judy left (the only other employee there) it'd just be me. Well they decide to leave their two kids there. 13 and 15 year old idiots who can stop fighting for 5 minutes.  Well In any case i get left alone with these two kids for 5 hours and after them randomly harassing me, fighting, and them tossign a key at me which hit me in the face btw, i finally get a break. 10 seconds into it the older one comes up to me and says they screwed up. so i go fix it, or at least try to but at the end of the night i find i'm 6.50 short on my till. nothing i was too happy about. Also, the kids are so immature they decide to ditch me to go to a hockey game, so they call in my boss's brother. He doesn't speak a word of english and can't follow directions whatsoever. since i'm alone and this guy doesn't know how to work a till i tell him to go to the front and ring the bell if anyone comes so i can ring through their purchases cause i had to start sweeping and mopping the floor. Remember when i said this guy doesn't follow directions? well i finish sweeping an aisle and i head to the front to sweep it and i see this guy looking at the movies we got while this old woman just sits there waiting to pay for some cards... Well all useless guys aside the rest of the day went well. After closing though the boss's brother asked me if i needed to go anywhere, and i said best buy (I wanted to cheer myself up with throwing away my cash). so this guy starts asking me question during the drive there, asks me something and i said yeah. turns out he asked if i was going to the bar. well after clearing that up he asked if i smoked. i said no, and he said good. then he grabbed my upper knee/lower thigh area. well more of a patting grab.... in any case it was odd... sort of arousing... no mostly odd. Anyways after those misadventures i ended up buying Good Will Hunting, High Fidelity, Gross Point Blank, and Matchstick Men. I've seen Gross Point and Matchstick before, gross point i haven't seen in a good 5 years, and matchstick is awesome. Haven't gotten around to watching any yet. But after work i went home and watched 1/2 of league of extraordinary gentlemen with my dad. an alright movie, i've seen it before. Also, on the walk back from work ran into my friend andrew, i've known that guy since grade 4. an awesome guy. walked with him and a girl named michelle home, and walked back with him talking about old times and good stuff. Haven't hung out much with him this year though since i noticed that were drastically different. which isn't exactly a bad thing. I've just been hanging out a lot more with friends that are a lot more like myself. But since he broke up with his Girlfriend a little while ago i've been making my best effort to keep in touch with him more. I've been a real jerk of a friend to him this year which i'm not proud of. he's the only one bothering to keep it up, calling me and stuff. So i'm gonna start reciprocating some of that. Anyways, Well in any case i stayed up to late and the next morning woke up 40 minutes before i was supposed to be in for work. The walk there is 15 minutes. Well It was an easy day cuase the wedding thing was today so itwas just me and judy all day. She's a pretty cool person and working with her is a lot fun. She's pretty funny. It was dead slow today and we got bored so, instead of recording the feed from the secuirity cameras we opened up and popped in two movies from our store, the mummy returns and jurassic park 2. So if they ask why there's a 4 hr gap in the recording we have no idea, and if they ask why two movies are opened just say its the customers and were covered.After work i took my parents out for dinner at humpty's (there choice... definitely not mine) and then bought The Joe Schmoe Show Season 1. So it's been a boring night. Watched a episode of Reno 911 and Comedy Now. Queer Eye For The Straight (A Deliciously odd show that i have a guilty pleasure in watching) was a re run so i found myself on the computer trying to get a life together and go do something with some friends. Anyways yeah that's my past few days. I booked the next 4 days off work so i go back friday. Looking forward to the down time. Well i got church tomorrow morning so i should cut this short. Cya guys around."

"event","Anyways I decided to get one of these cause mal peer pressured me into it, and i've been reading eric's a lot so. here goes nothing. I'm done school for this year now, finished my last exam on friday, and english written one consisting of two essays. A Personal Response (pretty much you can write in any form you want, short story, diary etc.) and critical essay with thesis and everything. well i totally froze and wrote a page for each, so i hope i'm not to screwed. In another, totally unrelated story i failed high school... j/k. I'm really glad drama is done forever though. My teacher was absolutely insane and hated me. she gave me the lowest mark out of everyone in Performing Arts (The plays that i do through out the year), kills me over everything, marks wise. i got tons more to say on that, maybe another time. Any ways, i picked up Driver 3 (For X-box of course) and Reno 911 Season 1 on DVD today, more random impulsive buying since i have nothing else in my life i'll just lie around here with all my material wealth. (<--sarcasm, might be a lot of that in these posts so be warned). I've watched 2 episodes of Reno and their hilarious. for anyone who wasn't seen them it's like cops, except for it takes place in reno nevada and it's a comedy show. It's unscripted. really funny odd stuff. i haven't played much of driver so i'll give you a more in depth review later. also, there's a TV audition coming up for a new canadian comedy show (that's right CANADIAN!). it's like SNL and Mad TV kind of thing. well it's audition here in my hometown, (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada btw, home to the largest mall in the world) and filming here too. I'm deciding whether or not i should start a 2 minute skit now and buff up on it so i forget when i go in and audition or whether i should not do anything and then go and audition and freeze up. i'll probably be doing a combination of both. Other than that not a whole lot going down with me. Other than freaking out that i got 1 more year left till i drop into a whirling void of nothing called the rest of my life and i have no idea how i'm gonna spend the next 60-70 years. But i got some stuff to look forward to Klondike days is coming up, (a travelling amusement park that hits my town every year) so i'm pretty excited about that. except last year a drunk, mentally handicapped (or at least resembling one) 40 year old tried to pick a fight with me and my friends. also a story for another time. also picked up a couple new CDs. The Postal Services Cd Give Up, good good music, i'll send people some songs of them if they want. and also The Shins two CDs Oh, Inverted World and Chutes To Narrow. another good band. Now that i'm rambling i'll end this now, and i'll catch up with you guys later. cya"

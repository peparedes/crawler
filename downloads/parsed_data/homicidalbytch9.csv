"event","So I decided at the beginning of the year to go back to school.  Over the summer I felt like I was working agianst myself.  My GPA from being dual enrolled was 1.23. REALLY BAD.  On top of that I decided to take 5 summer classes.  I ended up with 3 A's and two B's. That brought my GPA up to almost a 2.5 and I made the Dean's list.  The first time in a very long time I have had good academic standing in a very long time.  I am slowly working away at that bad GPA from high school.  I just went back for fall semester today and only have 4 classes.
ARyana is growing faster than I can handle.  She is almost 30 months old.  She is speaking alot more and is working on potty training.  I am thinking about starting to look for a preschool for her.  I know I will be in school and not around as much as I would like to be. I don't really know what preschool is best though.  
I hope everyone else is doing well."

Divorced don't talk to them and they never contact us or see their grandchild.  But I love my grandparents who I see every other day.
12. Who are some of your closest friends?
With school and all the work I don't feel I have a whole lot of close friends as I am soooooo busy with school and family, but the couple of people who I still love to hang out with are:  Rosey, it is nice to have a mommy friend who really undertsnads.  Lorie who just seems to always understand why I do the school and stuff Lena who has been my friend since grade school."

I am going back to school to eventually be a midwife and seeing Molly Bowser being born is now my motivation for finishing school and being able to do that a couple of times a month.  Thank you to Rosey and Jason for letting me being a part of that amazing experience. 

On another note tomorrow is my daughters surgery for her hernia.  We are at UVA right now as her surgery is at 7 in the morning.  I have never been so nervous about something as I am now.  They are going to be putting her under which scares me the most.  She will get a few stiches in her stomach and the sugery will be only an hour and a half.  IT is still so scary.  She is my little baby and I won't be able to be with her.  :(  It is going to be a very long morning."

"event","Aryana is going to be 19 months next week.  It is really hard to believe how fast time goes when you kids are babies.  She does so much now.  She says alot more now, walks, runs, and climbs.  It crazy to think about when she was a newborn.  She really enjoyed halloween, she was a ladybug.   By the the end of the night she started to understand to hold up the pumpkin to get the candy.  She hasn't gotten to eat a whole lot of the candy tho.  
We are thinking about trying for another baby after x-mas.  Kind of scary thinking about having another baby.  I want a big family and I think 2 1/2 years between kids is a good age gap. 
So anyway hope everyone is doing well."

So we are staying at my aunt's house with her two kids and husband.  I love my aunt and her family and am very greatful that she gave this oppurtunity to get on our feet until the baby is here.  On the other hand though I AM GOING CRAZY.  There isn't enough room for all of us.  I feel like I am expected to do everything with the kids and the house.  Hopefully soon we will be able to get into his parents house.  We are just waiting for his brother to move out.  His parents have been great to us too.  Everyone has been supportive about the pregnancy and all.  

On the subject of babies, I love knowing that our baby is growing in me and feeling her/him kick.  I hate being pregnant.  David has been getting more involved with the whole thing though.  He got really excited when the baby kicked him for the first time.  Hopefully soon we will be able to find out the sex of the baby.

I don't think it is fair to me at all that after I have done this for most of the people I know I continue to all of those same people want to use me as their doormat.  You don't like the way I run MY (MINE, not anyone elses but MINE) life I don't give two flying shits, because agian it is MY life.  The only person in this case that should be telling me AT ALL how I should act or so on should be my fiancee or husband.  So why  do people still feel the need to use my kindness and still be completly pissy with me ?

"event","So, I am going to be 19 in a few weeks.  

Through all of those 19 years I have bent over backwards and done backflips for my family.  ""hey Allena, insert name here is having a birthday party, can you drop everything call off of work so you don't make money to pull yourself out of your already covered grave and come to the birthday party.""  Yes mom I'll be there.

So my cousin has a birthday party Sun. and I missed it. Now, when someone misses your birthday your sad understanably.  But calling that person and saying ""you should be asahmed of yourself, you expect us to drop everything for you and do for you.  I am really pissed at you.""  Instead of waiting to hear my side you leave a message to tell me this and scream in my ear.  WTF ?  I don't ask for shit.  I don't ask for you to go buy my food, because all I can afford is 60cents worth of mac and cheese.  I don't ask for the $400 I need for the electric or the 300 that I need for the phone.  I don't ask for 8,000 to get me out of debt and even if i did you would laugh in my face.  So one more time let me know WHAT IN THE FUCK DO I ASK FOR, that you have to drop everything for ME ?  

Then, on top of my family, some people don't understand that I have a VERY LOW self-esteem.  I think I dog ass ugly.  I don't think very highly of myself.  So just because they feel like lets make fun of Allena.  What did I do to deserve being shit on by the entire fucking world ?  I am nice to people until they aren't respectful of me.  I think that is pretty fair.  But no just because you think you can, you completly tear down any respect I do have for myself.  ""It's just a joke""  THERE IS A FUCKING LINE BETWEEN JOKING AND FUCKING HURTING SOMEONES FEELINGS.  

So now I am going to go tell every person in the who has hurt me just exactly how I feel and in this process I am going to lose an entire family because they don't want me anyway, so lets just drive it a little farther to the point of breaking.  The friends that have hurt me and still call themselves ""friends"" will find out whats its like to have someone make you feel like shit. 

By the time I get done, at least I will have the few friends that I know care and wouldn't purposly hurt me and I will have my wonderful fiance.  But, I don't care what I don't have anymore, its about what I do, and that thought alone will keep me afloat in all this mess.  

Ohhh yeah until I get married I can't go back to school, because my mother refuses to give me anything for the FAFSA forms so I can afford it without more debt.  Fuck this world."

Life has been kinda crazy, I was in the hospital until last Tuesday, with bi-lateral pnumonia.  I quit breathing.  I had a near death experience, it was weird, for like 5 mins it was like I was above my body watching me.  i never saw the light or anything, my mom said ""that just proves you need to go to church more often.""  So through the entire thing I gained two things from it, I realized I needed to quit smoking, and have been cigarette free for over 2 weeks.  I also realized that I am not invincible, and that I need to start taking care of myself. Starting with learning how to control my bipolar and remember to take my meds every day.

"event","from Bipolar Disorder Demystified by Lana R. Castle:

Living with Bipolar Disorder is much like living your life on a tightrope-not because you choose to walk that tightrope but because it's the only available surface upon which you can walk. One false step, one impulsive moment, could easily end your life. Imagine being destined to walk that rope forever-either romping ecstatically across it or fighting a force that's pulling you down, and rarely achieving that elusive level ground. This is the experience of bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression).

Sometimes it feels great to be up on that rope. Incredible surges of energy and power make you think you're invincible. You believe wholeheartedly that you can pull off any trick you try. You know with certainty that you'll walk away unscathed.

Other times, you'll find you've fallen from your rope. You may lie tangled in the net or stuck in a dark abyss below. Or the tightrope you've been walking may now bind your body and threaten to cut you in half.

Untreated, bipolar disorder can put you one story or even five stories up when you're high and one story or even five stories down when you're low. If you're lucky, you may experience balance for a while. But you can never fully trust your next step. You can never fully trust your own mind."

I am just not sure how well everything is going to go.  So other than that, I go to the doctors office on tuesday.  So that might be fun.  Hope everyone is GRRRRRREAT.  I am for the day."

"event","So life has been really sucky. Even though I have been taking my meds(Seroquel 30mg, WellbutrinXL 300mg, Clonazepam 30mg) like I am supposed to. I have been dealing with cutting agian, which was something that I haven't done in almost 2 years. So on top of that I tried to go without my meds tonight because the seroquel makes me really sleepy and my younger cousin is here and will be up VERY early in the morning. But, I found that I can't sleep without my meds. I have tried sleeping since 10pm and now at 2am I am still no closer to feeling tired at all. I am not sure what to do, the meds are helping like I feel they should but I feel like I can't go without them....what do I do ? Has anyone who has been on these meds had this problem ? I just feel rather lost and confused. I was diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, and social anxiety 4 yrs ago and I still haven't found the right meds or something that will make me feel what in society is ""normal"" of course what the hell is normal. Ok, I don't feel like myself. I'm either in the cutting depressed yucky mood or going crazy from being manic."

"event","So today I went to my parents house for my uncle's birthday.  Isn't it always fun to go to your parents house...:) My grandfather still hates me, won't even look me straight in the eye all because I smoked when I lived there.  My cousins are crazy, hyper crazy, but good crazy.  I guess you have to be 5 years old in order to run around the yard a million times and have fun doing it.  The puppy is an ankle bitter, but she is adorable.  What puppy isn't adorable.  So overall it was a pretty good day, other than the fact that I am dying from a lack of oxygen due to a head cold.  and on top of that I feel like hot pins and needles are being stuck in my back.  Overall, I just feel like SHIT, but I had a good day."

"event","Yesterday was a good day, like the first good day in weeks until everyone left.  Then David goes and says ""what if I said if you cut yourself, then I will end our relationship?""  Why would you even say that ?  Is that a good way in your mind to help me ?  So then I get all depressed because I know that I can't stop thinking about doing it and don't know if I stop myself from doing it.  All I can think about it the razor blades in the house.  I don't know how to tell David that you can't help me that way, all you will do is hurt me more.  It's like he doesn't want to know how to help me, he just wants to say I don't know everytime I ask him something.  So on top of the fact that I want to cut so bad, now I have to think about him leaving me.  If you love someone, how can you even say that.  AHHHHHHHHHHH.  So I just want to go outside and scream REALLY loud, but then everyone would think I am even crazier."

On top of the cutting, I am having suicidal thoughts, I feel like everything is snowballing into one huge problem.  I am at a point where I know I can't be left alone in my house for fear of what I could do to myself, so then I am faced with this HUGE question, do I commit myself to the hospital or do I try and overcome the self-mutilation ?  Another problem is I feel like my relationship with my fiance is falling apart and I don't know what to do to hold it together. Someone anyone, please lend some advice.  I'm lost."

I have been feeling really shitty latley and felt like my meds weren't working, but I didn't think I needed to be diagnosed agian.  Well now my doc is telling I have personality disorders on top of everything, and when I clean my house I find razor blades.  If I even see one it makes me think about what it would feel like to do it agian.  I just wish this shit didn't run my life.  I wish I could let it go and go on with my life, but I don't think it is ever going to be that easy, which SUCKS!"

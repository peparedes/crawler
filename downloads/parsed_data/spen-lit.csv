Once again my obtuse agoraphobic sense has hit me, though the feeling is a little weaker than I will allow myself to believe. 

I'm terrified of leaving my house for reasons not entirely known to me at the moment. 

It's four in the morning and I can't sleep.&nbsp; I've tried to lie down and force myself to sleep, but every time I close my eyes I can see my pulse thumping fast and hard against the&nbsp;lids of my eyes.&nbsp; Don't worry - I'm not trying to be poetic here - anxiety is anything but poetic most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

On the subject of poetry, I have to admit that I doubt I could write a good piece of it, even (and especially) if I tried.&nbsp; Now that we've cleared that up ... 

Resting heart rate:&nbsp; 77. 

Perhaps if I focus everything I've got on this, my pulse will slow.&nbsp; Maybe if I could just remember that all is right I wouldn't feel so overwrought at the trifles that only exist at four in the morning.&nbsp; What would be a useful expedient for sleep?&nbsp; I wonder if I ask too many questions. 

Think poetry...&nbsp; Think long, mundane, wildlife poetry.&nbsp; Perhaps something written about birds.... 

Resting heart rate:&nbsp; 71. 

That feels much better.&nbsp;"

I was wrong.

I realized the consequence of my decision shortly after midnight when, from my bathroom, I hear a group of people moaning, pounding, and breaking things.

As people began to wake up this morning, I made it very clear to all of them that I wouldn't step foot in my bathroom until someone cleaned the floor, which appeared to blotched with mystery spots.

At this late hour, I still haven't been able to use my damn bathroom.

Un relatedly, I've managed to hit an all time low in healthy decision making:

I put twenty-four sugar packets into my Starbucks coffee this afternoon.  And I drank the whole damn thing.

I haven't watched those tapes in years, but I'm writing a book about the shit (<lj user=""insideyourhead""> would know) so I had to get some reference.

Kristen certainly had a lot to say about the whole thing, as she normally does, and I think it's pretty safe to admit that I've spent the last two hours laughing so hard my stomach hurts.

Bless you, Tommy.  You're such a good liar.  Pot and the kettle.

He wastes tape telling me that (and I quote), ""If you don't love me forever, I'll destroy the world!"" followed by some bullshit about how ""boring"" some party at Light had been.  

The party probably bored him because he couldn't get laid - pay no mind to the fact that he had a girlfriend in Denver.  It was perfectly acceptable to have sex with other women, just as long as I didn't find out, which I did anyway.

He was special like that.

I'm thinking about copying the tapes and sending them to every news and cable station, in hopes that someone will play them on TV.

What do you guys think?

Should I do it and destroy some poor schmuck's life?

"event","I had an exhausting conversation with a girl in my audio production class this afternoon.

She argued with me about the concept of frequency.  

I tried to explain the term in it's simplest context - Frequency equates to cycles of sound per second measured in Hertz.  

After almost twenty minutes, she still had no idea what frequency has to do with a sound wave, yet she's taken this class three semesters in a row.

And all this time I was under the impression that CU students were relatively bright.

It would seem that I'm one of the few.

Un relatedly, I caught a little of 'American Idol Las Vegas' this evening and, out of morbid curiosity, decided to sit down and watch.

Once again, my assessment that most residents of Vegas are fucking trash has proved to be correct.

I was absolutely certain of this after seeing an anorexic farm girl, wearing over-sized hot pink glittered vinyl pants with a matching cowboy hat, try and sing an Elvis song.

Her performance was breath taking, and anything that suffocates me can't be a good thing."

""Hey Jack (because I know you're name's not Jacques, as you so gaily claimed), I too thought the Parthenon was simply a painting....oh, wait....nevermind.  I'm thinking of someone else.""

I thought he was interesting until he said, ""So tell me about your life.  What have you done?""

How the hell does someone go about answering that question?

I couldn't think of anything else to say except, ""Oh, I do a little of this, and a little of that.  I write goofy entries in my online journal, when I was younger I got a thrill out of testing the statutory rape laws, and I've got a ""bomb pit"" theory.  Yes, a ""bomb pit"" theory.""

I'm social like that.

Tommy looked at me for a moment, then asked if he could ""get my number"".

I told him that I didn't date guys named 'Tommy', then offered to introduce him to my ice pick.

Apparently my tact wasn't up to par because he didn't get my oh-so-obvious hint.  

He said, ""I understand.  You're shy.""

ME:  That's right, I'm shy.  Would you like to go gun shopping with me?

The moron actually accepted my offer, then said that he'd have to get my number so we could set up a time.

What a winner.

When I see him again, I'm going to ask if I can use him for target practice.

I'm still not sure what day it is, truth be told.

I sat in my art class this morning high as a kite, possessed by thoughts of awe and admiration over the fact that my body is slowly trying to asphyxiate itself.

The illness is due to my insistence on having ""game night"" with my girlfriends last night.  We played ""Imangin...iff"" and I learned that if I were a gift, I'd be a book, and if I were a weapon, I'd be a nuclear bomb.  I was also the only one in the group who knew what ""RCA"" meant.

She says, ""Hi Miss. Aspen,"" (putting on her best *I'm an angel* face) ""That's a really pretty sweater.""

""Well, thank you Lisa,"" I said.

Just then, the little Indian girl that Dre has a crush on walks by, and little Miss. Piggy starts taunting,
""Draven and Lidea sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.  First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the baby carriage!""

Well, normally I wouldn't intervene (after all, kid's disgusting little games are so precious and heartwarming) but on this occasion, Draven was giving me the *please save me from the mockery of this little fat girl* look, so what else could a mother do?

I looked right at her and said, ""Sweetie, it's the twenty-first century.  It doesn't really work that way anymore.  Let me explain: first comes the baby, and unless you have an abortion, THEN comes marriage, and if you're lucky, your husband won't beat you up.  If he doesn't, then comes love.  You've got it all backward.""

After a brief pause, I smiled.

She just stood there in whatever kind of shock a shitty little nine-year-old can feel.  Still smiling, I told her to be good in school, and walked away.  As we walked, Draven turned around and stuck his tongue out at her.  I don't normally encourage this type of behavior, but to save Draven's boyhood, I figured I should let him get a jab in for good measure.

Don't you wish I was your mother? Mm, well I'm sure you do now.

On a much more pleasant note:  

I was cleaning out Draven's backpack last night and found a half-eaten sandwich that had to be about three months old.

"event","For bein such a fucked up night last night, I had SO much fun. I found out who my REAL friends were, and made a new one! Rachael... (like Michael, only with a RA ;) Which is too cool, because we had so much fun yesterday. I had a little problem over a ""friends"" house and i had to leave a 3:00 am. Which sucked because i couldn't get into my house, what the fuck was  i gonna do?  Luckily MY ANGEL Sammy called me at 3:17 am and let me stay with him at his house. It was nice. I had fun. Some might say that would be a whorey thing for me to do but guess what i have to say to you??  Fuuuuuckk    yooou!                                        Thank you my prince/ god/ .....

BUT... that didn't work out, and I couldn't be away from my katie that long, So! i drove aaaaaall the way out there by.. MYSELF. Which was so fun! I love her fam damnly! They were too cute! I beat katies ass in Basketball and watched fireworks, Staired at her hott brothers booTay a little bit... and we also got caought in our tent with mikes hard lemonade :) Her mommy heard us clinking them together. We didn't care at the time though, we were gone. 

    Well... We drove home and an hour later i went to dickinson island with my mom and her boyfriend to my moms boss's cottage. Which was so fun! oh my god. my moms boss's nephew was there also, he was a blast. He took me on the jet ski's... and he even let me drive (obviously, he didn't know me too well) and we went on a boat ride, and we also went tubing together. I thought i was gonna die (i lost my voice that afternoon) we were poppin around like popcorn... but it was okay because Tim held my hand and told me he wouldn't let us tip.  luckily he was with me because i would have been fish bait.  :)   :)    :)   I wanna go back :(

"event","Man... I don't know what the hells wrong with me today! I'm not PMS'n .... Its too early. I feel like shit. I don't know how to deal with my feelings, i think. Yeah.. Thats probably it. Everything is catching up to me and making me cry. I hate crying. i look so ugly when i cry.  my eyes get all blotchy, and my nose turns red. like a cherry. its horrible.   
I think i've been hanging out with Katie too much, and her Emo bullshit has rubbed off on me. Oh well... 




You know, I've decided that vibrators are wonderful...

because they don't make me cry.

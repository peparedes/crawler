I've had an account with them since 2004 for www.147300.com 

I've never had this kind of problem with them before.

Dad had the jeremyrudolph.com account with them.  After a spell of issues with them including the fact that they had contracted a worm on their server that when connected to via FTP totally fried Dad's laptop and a computer belonging to a pc repair dude.....  we moved Jeremyrudolph.com to Godaddy and dad then asked Ipower to cancel his account.

Guess what.  They cancelled the account alright.  The WRONG one.  

I am so pissed with them right now, I don't know what to do."

"event","<b>You want change?  Try these ideas...</b> 


Each presidential candidate is giving his rendition of the changes he wants for America.  Here are a few that I believe all Americans want.

1.  Limit Congress from serving more than two terms.  This is all the Presidents are allowed.

2.  Stop Congress from voting on their own pay raises.  How did that ever get started?

3.  Stop paying for lawmakers' high-priced insurance premiums.  After all, the are only part-time employees.  Them might pass some law changes on the insurance companies, if they had to find one.

4.  Stop paying lawmakers their full salary after serving just one term...or at retirement.  We need to get rid of that pension plan; they've let other companies get rid of theirs.  Some were luck to get 40 or 50 percent salary after working somewhere for 35 years, but they get 100 percent.

5.  Make Congress pay into the Social Security system.  They make laws for it.  If they spent some of their own money, they might be interested in making is solvent. 

6.  Stop handing out aid to illegal aliens.  If we did, then Medicaid and the food stamp program would have enough money to aid the aged and the poor.  

7.  Secure our borders.

8.  Stop allowing babies born to illegal aliens in the U.S. automatic U.S. Citizenship.  

9.  Stop the abuse of our benevolent welfare system.  We feed children free meals three times a day until they are 17.  Churches give away good, clean clothes.  Companies buy and donate school supplies.  Emergency rooms provide health care at taxpayer expense and the food stamp program is buying food at home.  What are the parents doing for their children?

10.  Have a computer program that cross checks social security numbers with fingerprints to stop fraud on many fronts.  Use it for voter registration too.

11.  Stop bailing out mortgage companies and banks that give loans to people who cannot afford them.

12.  Stop companies from paying CEOs and other executives outrageous salaries and bonuses while doing away with workers' pensions. 

13.  Stop all unnecessary spending so we will have the money for our nation's security, and to help needy and elderly Americans.

14.  Stop permitting anyone to have a photo with their face covered on driver's licenses.


Whoever wins the presidency will not be able to make these changes.  Only members of Congress can do this, as they are the lawmakers.  I don't believe Congress is interested in changing anything, do you?"

"event","haven't needed one yet.  Emma has always stayed away from the staircase.  She hasn't shown any interest in it...and passes it by all the time.  Occasionally, she'll look that way, but always looks to one of us and never goes further closer to it.

Today was different.  I came out of the bedroom after being in there for 10 seconds, and she had her back turned to the stairs...and when she heard me yell ""Emma, NO!"" she went to sit on her butt and went backwards down the stairs into the split foyer landing.  

I've never been so pissed at myself.  I flew down the stairs after her was there in a split second...but it was too late, she had already made it down.  I got to watch her roll backwards several times on the way down.  I was an inch from grabbing her before she fell down the first step.  

We've been putting off the baby gate for too damn long.  Money has been a factor since moving into this house..we've been simply living on a wing and a prayer especially considering the holidays, short work weeks, and all the money we had to put out in order to move into this place when we should've have had to go anywhere.  

Looks like when we take Tris home later the baby gate shopping trip will begin.  

I am so irritated with this happening."

Michelle > Hi!
chad_ > hello
Michelle > How are you, Chad?
chad_ > a tad irritated but otherwise just fine
Michelle > I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you, Chad.
Michelle > Let me check into this.
Michelle > As I understand, you want to use digital voice center for your call logs?
chad_> yes. but it won't let me log in, says I don't have digital voice, which I do
Michelle > Thank you for that information.
Michelle > Please give me one to two minutes to check on your account and run a health check on your connection.
chad_ > ok
Michelle > Thank you for patiently waiting.
Michelle > I ran a check on digital voice center and I see here that it is currently upgrading
Michelle > That is why, you cannot access it.
Michelle > Rest assured, your logins are working, it's just that the site cannot be access now for it is upgrading.
Michelle > Kindly log in again within a few hours.
Michelle > It will be up within 24 hours. 
chad_ > ok... 
chad_ > you were a much better help than the first person I chatted with today
Michelle > You're very welcome. It's a pleasure helping you out.

chad > Authentication Failed You currently have Comcast High Speed Internet but not Comcast Digital Voice. The Digital Voice Center is for subscribers who also have Comcast Digital Voice.
Carol > Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Carol. Please give me one moment to review your information.
Carol > I will be happy to help you with that.
Carol > What is your issue Chad?
chad_ > i have digital voice. I cannot access the DVC on the comcast website. 
Carol > Have you set up your voicemail?
chad_ > yes
Carol > What is the phone # on the account?
chad_ > 540450****
Carol > Let me bring up your account.
Carol > Let me open up a ticket on your issue.
Carol > Have you been able to log into the DVC before?
chad_ > no. the digital voice service is new as of yesterday
Carol > ok Chad it will take a few more days before you will be able to log into it.
chad_ > why
chad_ > I'm paying for it. that, and all the features. why can't I use it now.
Carol > You have a new account.
chad_ > um...the phone works. my voicemail works. I can't use all the features that I signed up for. yet, I'm expected to pay for them
chad_ > that was never explained to me prior to setting up the phone service
Carol > Have you been able to log into it before?
chad_ > if you scroll up, you'll be able to see, that I've answered that question before
Carol > How were you trying to access it by phone # and passcode or comcast.net username and password? 
chad_ > actually, I've tried both. about ten times. it simply won't work. it's giving me an error code number DVC-109. Authentication failed.
Carol > Ok Chad that is the error you get when it is not accessible to you. You need to give it 24-48 hrs.
chad_ > that is BS. there is nothing in the documentation that says it takes a day or two to work. I guarantee you, that I will be contacting Comcast in a couple days...because it still doesn't work. I seriously think that no one has a real answer.
chad_ > if ""waiting 24-48 hours"" was the definitive answer, there would be no reason for you to ask me ""how did you log in? by comcast user/passwd or tel and pin?""
Carol > Is there anything else i can assist you with?
chad_ > first person I chatted with this morning spent 30 minutes to tell me three different stories. the second I chatted with told me that the system was upgrading. and now, you're telling me that I have to wait.
chad_ > yes. you can assist me with just one more thing
Carol > What is it?
chad_ > get your stories straight.

William > Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is William. Please give me one moment to review your information.
William > Please wait, while the problem is escalated to another analyst
William > Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is William. Please give me one moment to review your information.
William > and how may i assist you today ?
chad_ > I cannot access the DVC. 
chad_ > you are the forth analyst today
chad_ > no one can give me a straight answer
William > sorry to hear that
 chad_ > no one answers the phoe, because there is no option for digital voice
William > just to make sure i have the right account whats the name and address on the account
chad_ > so I'm stuck here, chatting
chad_ > i typed that stuff into the browser before I started the chat
chad_ > you can't see that?<
/PRE>William > sorry i cant can you repost it please 
chad_ > that's stupid to ask me to put the info in and then you can't even use it. my name is chad rudolph. my address is *** McClure Way Winchester, VA 22602
chad_ > do you copy?
William > one moment 
William > have you set up the voice mail feature yet <
William > ?
chad_ > I have
chad_ > yes
chad_ > I set it up yesterday an hour after the installer turned on the phone service
William > all you have to do is call your home phone number from your home phone area code first and then press the (#) sign it will ask for a password and that will be the last 4 digits of your home telephone number, once you run through seting up a new password and the recording and what not it will be set up.
chad_ > this copy/paste stuff is useless to me, as I've already set up and used my voicemail
William > and you had it installed yesterday 
chad_ > that is exactly what I said above.
William > well with some of the features it can some times take up to 72 hours before the features are working corerctly 
chad_ > lol
chad_ > the last analyst said 24-48. now you tell me it's 3 days?
chad_ > that is unacceptable
William > or 72 business hours 
William > sorry to hear that you feel that way 
chad_ > nice to hear you say you're sorry. but that doesn't fix an issue. If it takes 72 hours to keep me away from using the full features, then why am I paying for the use when I can't use it?
chad_ > if I was told beforehand that I'd have to wait for the online stuff to work 72 ""business-day-hours"" after installation, this would not be as big a deal.
chad_ > instead, I paid to have this installed, and not be able to use the full features.
William > well the digital voice center is a free feature 
chad_ > nothing is free, William
William > your not paying to use it sir it comes with comcast services 
chad_ > comcast services, which I pay to use. which it says I can use when I pay for the services.
chad_ > I believe, I'm done with you too.

Paramjit > Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Paramjit. Please give me one moment to review your information.
Paramjit > I understand it can be quite frustrating when things do not work as they were intended to Chad.
Paramjit > Let's try to fix that during this chat, and if we can't, then I will be happy to escalate this. But let's see what we can do first.
Paramjit > May I get your phone number, so that I can call up your account information and run a health check on your connection (to see if anything is affecting you or your area)?
chad_ > you understand? that's reassuring.
chad_ > 540450****
chad_ > that's my digital voice number
Paramjit > Thank you, one minute please.
Paramjit > That error is usually caused by a few usual culprits Chad.
chad_ > oh?
Paramjit > How long ago did you have Comcast Digital Voice installed ?
chad_ > do tell
chad_ > yesterday afternoon
Paramjit > Okay, have you activated your voice mail services by calling into your phone and entering your passcode yet?
chad_ > I sure have!
chad_ > did it yesterday, as I was anxious to try my new phone service!
Paramjit > Okay then you will just need to wait about another 48 hours and it should be working. The set up time for access on the Digital Voice Center is within 72 hours after you activate
voice mail and confirm you are using the service.
chad_ > no one told me that...but I sure am glad you did!
chad_ > now I'm really excited!
Paramjit > Just make sure you are trying to log in with the Primary Email address and not the phone number and pass code.
chad_ > oh I am. I will continue to try diligently!
Paramjit > Do you have any other questions or concerns I can help you with today?
chad_ > no! you have been a great help and a joy to chat with!
Paramjit > Thank you for choosing Comcast. Have a great day! If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us again or check out the Comcast website for answers to frequently asked questions at http://sitesearch.comcast.net/?q=CDV+faq&c=com .

chad > can't access the DVC, says ""authentication failed""
Omar > Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Omar. Please give me one moment to review your information.
Omar > Ill be more than glad to help you!
chad_ > great, Omar!
Omar > Are you using the primary user name to sign in?
chad_ > yes, I am
Omar > Which user name are you using?
chad_ > chad.rudolph (the primary one)
Omar > Have you tried to sign in with your comcast phone number and voice mail pin?
chad_ > Yes I have, Omar. It still says ""authentication failed""
Omar > One sec let me check for outages in your area for the digital voice center.
Omar > I don't show any outages. Are you able to get your voice mail over the phone?
chad_ > Yes I am. I can check it from the digital voice phone, as well as my cell phone.
Omar > Yes.
chad_ > Yes.
Omar > Are you able to sign in to your comcast.net e-mail account with that user name?
chad_ > Yes I am
Omar > Ok for some reason it is thinking the user name has the wrong password so what I will need to do is open a ticket on the issue and it can be resolved with in 24-72 hours.
chad_ > are you sure that's the issue?
Omar > Yes because if you are able to get into comcast
.net e-mail then the pass word is ok.THe user name for comcast.net e-mail and for DVC are the same.
chad_ > Yes, they are...but wouldn't it say the password is incorrect...instead of telling me that I can't access the DVC because I'm not a subscriber of Digital Voice?
chad_ > when in fact, I am?
Omar > Yes the ticket will resolve that for you If the pass word was incorrect it would tell you and its not and we know the pass word is good.There is an internal issue that isnt letting it work.If it is thinking your not a subscriber then it it will be fixed as well because the
tech will reset the digital voice center and will make sure you are able to log in before resolving the ticket.
chad_ > that would be nice. I'd really like to use the services I'm paying for.
Omar > I agree and I will make sure they fix it so you are able to use it.
chad_ > Thank you Omar. If you make sure they fix it I have every trust it will be done.
Omar > Your very welcome and be just a second and I will give you the confirmation number for the ticket incase you want to check on the status.
chad_ > Great!
Omar > I do apologize but I show they had opened a ticket due to you not having a security pin.That will have to be fixed first before the DVC issue can be escalated.The ticket was opened yesterday. 
chad_ > security pin? huh? 
Omar > Comacast sends a pin in the mail for you when you first get service.It seems comcast did not create one for you and you must have a security pin.I cant open a ticket for DVC till that pin is created.A ticket for that to be done was yesterday so it should be resolved by tomorrow.
chad_ > great. so a mistake made by Comcast is the reason why I have to wait to use the services I'm paying for.
chad_ > not fair, Omar. 
<b><i>Omar > I do understand and I will place a 20 dollar credit on your account.</i></b>
chad_ > I want the entire amount for the installation refunded. I pay for the services and the installation, and since then I've had to sit here and chat with you, and 5 others before you to figure out why the installation wasn't completed.
chad_ > this is not my fault. 
Omar > I do apologize but that isn't part of the install.The Dvc is something comcast will add for you but they don't charge you for it.
Omar > You don't have to pay for the DVC its free.
chad_ > that's not the point. it's not complete. I've had to sit here and spend my time on the internet and phone to try to get this resolved, when it wasn't my fault in the first place.
Omar > Were you just installed the 26th?
chad_ > yes.
Omar > Ok you wont need the ticket.It take 3 days after install before all the features are working correctly.Your features should all be up and running by the end of tomorrow.
chad_ > changing your mind? I thought you were sure that it was a password issue.
chad_ > make up your mind, Omar.
Omar > I just checked the install date Im not changeing my mind Chad.
Omar > changing*
chad_ > you told me that this was a password issue. then you said something about the ""security pin."" Now, it's because I was just installed on the 26th. 
Omar > I just check when you mentioned you wanted a refund for install.That was my mistake sorry.
Omar > The security pin isn't created because you just got installed
Omar > All this will be provisioned by tomorrow.
chad_ > Thank you. And the $20 credit?
Omar > I wont be able to add that because the you are able to call out and check voice mails via phone.The features require a 3 day period.
chad_ > you told me that you'd credit me $20 and now you can't? haha. 
Omar > I thought you had been with us for a while since you were able to answer my questions and navigate so quickly so I thought we had messed every thing up for you.Since you only got installed the 26th then that changes everything .
chad_ > Omar, I've had internet with Comcast since last year. I have been with you for awhile.
chad_ > my time is worth more than nothing. 
chad_ > This transcript will be saved, and sent to whomever it matters. 
Omar > I can send you a copy to your e-mail if you would like?
chad_ > no need. I can take care of that, plus...you have done enough already."

"event","<p>I may be making a bigger deal out of this than what it's worth...but when I pay for something, I expect it work.&nbsp; Completely.&nbsp; Really, is that too much to ask? <br /><br />I've been a Comcast internet subscriber since last November.&nbsp; After the move, I signed up for Comcast &quot;Digital Voice&quot; phone service...since it's cheaper than getting a phone line with Verizon.&nbsp; Just makes more sense to have two services on one bill to me as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />The &quot;transfer&quot; took 43 minutes on the phone.&nbsp; After that, a guy came to the house, installed the internet, made the call to Comcast, and left with the internet working well.&nbsp; Ten minutes after he &quot;installed&quot; it, I was on the phone with Comcast because it stopped working.&nbsp; I ended up, while talking to a representative, used the computer and downloaded some Comcast software and installed and set up the internet myself.&nbsp; The rep told me at that point that I could've done it all myself, using a &quot;self-install&quot; and saved myself 19.95 in install charges.&nbsp; Well..&nbsp; isn't that nice.&nbsp; <br /><br />The rep came to install the digital voice two days ago...and left with the phone working fine.&nbsp; Comcast doesn't offer a self-install kit for the Digital Voice service in the Winchester area.&nbsp; 39.95 to install the phone service.&nbsp; A little later I tried to access the &quot;Digital Voice Center&quot; on the internet...which is a webpage where you can check all call logs and listen to voicemails on the web.&nbsp; Very cool...much cooler if it would work.&nbsp; <br /><br />So... calling Comcast they don't offer a choice for the Digital Voice...only cable and internet.&nbsp; So I had to resort to the online chat.&nbsp; What a mistake. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""The transcripts below will tell the story.""></lj-cut>&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008 8:37 AM <br />Subject: eSupport Chat Transcript <br /><br />chad &gt; can't access my digital voice center. says I don't have digital voice and it was installed yesterday <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Hello chad_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Mary Geraldine. Please give me one moment to review your information. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I will be happy to assist you with your concern. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Have you set up your voicemail? <br />chad_ &gt; yes <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Was this through your phone? <br />chad_ &gt; I set up my voicemail yesterday after it was installed, using my new digital voice service <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you for that information. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you for that information. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; For verification purposes, may I ask for your account number. <br />chad_ &gt; I don't have it. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; That is alright. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I have the last four digits of your social, instead. <br />chad_ &gt; **** <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you. I am currently opening your account information. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I have the last four digits of your social, instead. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I know where you set up your voicemail feature, Chad. <br />chad_ &gt; I answered that question already. I set it up from my house, on my new phone service <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you for that information. Have you set it up in the Digital Voice Center? <br />chad_ &gt; I can't access the Digital Voice Center. That's why I'm here chatting with you <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I understand. Thank you for clarifying it for me. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I will provide you the steps. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Are you able to log in using the primary email account? <br />chad_&nbsp; it won't let me log in. it says I don't have digital voice service. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I am sorry to hear of this, I am currently opening my tools for you. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Are you able to log in to your email account using your comcast.net primary email account information? <br />chad_ &gt; I can log into my email account on comcast.net. but when I try to log into my digital voice center it says I login failed <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Can you please try this steps: <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; 1. Open a web browser and go to <a href=""http://digitalvoice.comcast.net/"">http://digitalvoice.comcast.net/</a>. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; 2, Log into the DVC using your primary Comcast.net username and password. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; 3. Complete as many of the fields on the first page as you choose. The various telephone numbers will be used for call forwarding and the email addresses for voicemail message notification and message forwarding. You should also choose your time zone so that your call records will be accurate. <br />chad_ &gt; it says &quot;authentication failed&quot; <br />chad_ &gt; it won't let me log in <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Let me check on this for you. <br />chad_ &gt; this is what it says, &quot;You currently have Comcast High Speed Internet but not Comcast Digital Voice. The Digital Voice Center is for subscribers who also have Comcast Digital Voice.&nbsp; If you feel our records are incorrect, please call Customer Service at 1-800-COMCAST. <br />[Error DVC-109] <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I know the information you used to log in. <br />chad_ &gt; <a href=""mailto:chad.rudolph@comcast.net"">chad.rudolph@comcast.net</a> <br />chad_ &gt; password is ********* <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Did you just type in chad.rudolph or with @comcast.net? <br />chad_ &gt; i typed the entire email address. exactly how I type it when I normally log in for my email <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Please try to log in using only chad.rudolph and the password *********<br />chad_ &gt; I keep telling you, it won't let me log in. <br />chad_ &gt; I'm paying you for a service I expect it to work. I can't log in <br />chad_ &gt; it won't let me <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I am sorry to hear of this, Chad, I understand that you are not able to log in correctly. <br />chad_ &gt; THEN fix it <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I am currently opening your account to check if you have voicemail. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you for patiently waiting. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I am currently checking your account. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Have you transferred to a new location, Chad? <br />chad_ &gt; what does that have to do with this <br />chad_ &gt; the phone service is new <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you for that information. I have checked your account and I can see here that you have voicemail. <br />chad_ &gt; no kidding <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I am currently following the troubleshooting steps for this issue. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I have the telephone number affected, Chad. <br />chad_ &gt; 540450**** <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Thank you. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I will now activate a system check for Voicemail features. This automated query will validate the billing and provisioning status of the features. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Have you completed your original voicemail set-up? <br />chad_ &gt; this is the second time you've asked me that. YES <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; May I know how you are accessing your voicemail box. <br />chad_ &gt; from my new comcast digital voice phone, from home <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; When you try to dial your telephone number, Is your call forwarded to a third party or does the mailbox number prompts? <br />chad_ &gt; it goes directly to my voicemail <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I will need to reset your voicemail passcode, Chad, Is this alright? <br />chad_ &gt; whatever it takes to get this working, do it. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I can see here that our system is unable to retrieve CPNI data. I will have to escalate a ticket to resolve the CPNI error. <br />chad_ &gt; you have got to be kidding me <br />chad_ &gt; this is ridiculous <br />chad_ &gt; 30 minutes and you still can't fix the issue? <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; The CPNI data issue will need to be resolved prior to escalating your voicemail issue. <br />chad_ &gt; unbelievable <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; The CPNI pin is the authentication number needed for your account, Chad. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; Your Digital Voice service number need this for authentication. <br />chad_ &gt; I don't care. I shouldn't have to spend any of my time trying to fix a problem that isn't my fault. it should work when it is installed <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I have found out that your account does not have a CPNI pin yet, <br />chad_ &gt; and why exactly is that? <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; This is a four digit number provided by Comcast through postal mail. <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; This is an authentication number for your Comcast Digital Voice service. <br />chad_ &gt; my phone works. my voicemail works. being able to access it on the internet is the issue. this is stupid. and I'm paying for it! <br />chad_ &gt; and I can't complain, because no one answers the phone. so I'm stuck here, with service that doesn't completely work <br />Mary Geraldine &gt; I apologize for the inconvenience, Chad. This error message could be caused by your cache. <br />chad_ &gt; lol <br />chad_ &gt; you are completely useless <br /><br /><br /><br />so after this chat.&nbsp; I started going back, and finding new people to chat with.&nbsp; I'll post more soon.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;</p>"

"event","moving sucks.  We still have a lot to do at the old house...  we have a prelim walk-through with our property manager tomorrow at 3:30...so today will be the day that we remove the majority of what's left and Stef will head over this evening with one of her friends to clean the shithole.

I'll be totally restless until this all gets done.  So I'll probably stop by today for lunch and pick up a bunch of shit.

Emma loves the house.  She seems happier...loves to just sit on the livingroom floor and play for hours.  She also sleeps through the majority of the night.  

Time to get going.  Need coffee."

"event","We move tomorrow.  This is something I wish I had a bottle of percocet to help the day go by quicker.  (and to keep my lower back from eating me alive)  

I'm going to pop some sleepy-inducing-pills tonight to make sure I am well rested...and get up early to take the computers off-line and transport them 3.11 road miles to the new house.  My madre will pick up Emma around 9, and the movers will be here around 9:30.  It will cost some cash to get it done, but it will be totally worth it.  It's the same group that moved us last November and they do an excellent job.  I even trust the lcd television to them.  Yes, they're that good.

Although, I'm only trusting myself with the move of my grill.  

More later.  I'm really, really... tired."

"event","I just want to make it abundantly clear.  I hate moving.  

Here we are again, one year later from the last time we moved, into this ""great"" house.  And now, we have to move.  Not because we're bad tenants.  Not because we defaulted on our rent.  Not because we didn't follow the terms of the lease.  Not because we trashed the house.  Not our decision at all.

Nope.  It's because our batshit lunatic landlord is a stupid busybody bitch; and wouldn't renew our lease because she's tired of arguing with us when we stand up for our rights as renters.  

We've developed a hatred for her and her bullshit, including how she likes to just drop by whenever she chooses to without notice or reason.  It began as an annoyance...and turned into her knowing full well that it's improper and illegal...she also knows it drives us crazy.  We've had to put locks on the backyard gates to keep her from just showing up in the back yard and snooping around...now she just climbs over the fence.  

Making a long story very short..  we are done.  She came here this past August and told Stefanie she wasn't going to renew our lease.  And that's fine... because despite the fact we have to move all over again and pay more rent than what we're paying now... we will not have to deal with her.

What really sucks is...even though she's breaking the law, law enforcement will not do anything about it.  We would actually have to find a lawyer and sue her.  

We have plenty of evidence should we choose to do so.  Including photos.  

Anyway.. we found this house about 3 miles from here, that is huge inside and very nice.  The neighborhood seems nice although it's more populated there...  so we'll see what happens.  We may even move again next year; hopefully into a house we can own.  But in the meantime, we have to move.  This weekend.  And it sucks.

I hate moving."

"event","I'm sitting here listening to the most annoying person on ham radio today.

For those not ""in the know,""  I'm a control operator for an amateur radio <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater"">repeater</a>; one of the busiest repeaters in the country.  By FCC regulations, I am responsible for making sure the transmissions on the repeater do not violate Part 97.

So I have to listen.  A lot.  As often as possible.

This guy is the most hardcore right-wing conservative old-fart piss-ass windbag I've ever had to listen to.  He's always right.  He would've made the right decisions for this country, and everyone else is wrong.  Democrats are all going to hell.  He drives a Mazda pickup truck to work every day...a 2.5 hour commute from Mineral County WV all the way into Northern VA; where he works for the Federal Govt.  I listen to this guy spit his nonsense every single damn morning and afternoon all week long.  I despise him.  

He's sitting on top of a mountain on the border of Hampshire and Hardy county right now...  watching trucks slip and slide down a hill into Romney, WV.  He's been sitting there since 4:40am.  He's contemplating taking a chance on going down; before the WV State truck gets there to salt the road.  (which could take a full day to happen) 

""It would be nice to have a four wheel drive right now,"" he utters.  



I'm really, really wanting him to take the chance.  I'm a bad person."

I don't blame John McCain for his loss.  I blame the current Republican president and the subsequent downfall of an entire nation on so many levels during his presidential reign.  I blame this ridiculous war and the way we treat our soldiers and their families.  I blame business-as-usual politics and the backwards-ass way of decision making that has plagued us for so long.  

I'm not angered at the results of the election; I really have no reason to be; especially since I refuse to vote.  I am just apprehensive about the next four years.  The biggest issue I have with a Democratic presidency is infringement of 2nd Amendment rights.

Bush has left this country in a total shambles.  Mr. Obama has his work cut out for him.  

Bottom line is though... majority rules no matter how ""right"" or ""left"" your beliefs are.  That is a fact.  Obama won the electoral vote by a margin of 200+, and the popular vote by almost 7,000,000 votes.  So no matter what; this is our political system at work...and it works the same for all political parties and their candidates.  Republicans can hate Democrats all they like... and say what they will about this election, but the American majority has spoken.  

And now, after months of listening to the predominantly right-wing populous on the 147.300 WA4TSC amateur radio repeater and their ""if you don't vote republican you're fucking fired"" mentality offer their extremely biased opinions on both candidates; now I have to listen to all of them bitch about how ""all those people who voted for <i>him</i>"" have ruined America.  

If that's the case...then the voting majority have ruined America.  If that's the case, the political electoral system that they believe in so staunchly has failed.  

Thing is... there are over 300,000,000 people in this country.  As it stands, approximately 117,000,000 voted.  

I guess that means that the true majority have spoken as well.  Well, I'm a member of that particular majority.

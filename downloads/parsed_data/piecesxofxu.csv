"event","I am home. And sick. :( My dad came and got me after 1st hour today. I came home and passed out on the bathroom floor and I get a call from Meisel lol. I don't really remember anything except waking up to get the phone all lightheaded and shit and him bein like ""YOU MISSED YOUR SAFTEY TEST!!"" after that, what was said is a mystery to me.

 After those two weird dreams about people dieing two nights ago, I had a Chris dream last night. It made me miss him a little. It's the first time I've missed him in a long time. I'm glad that feeling only lasted a couple minutes..

 Homecoming is like, 3 weeks away and as far as I'm concerned me and Becca are still going but I'd much rather have a date that would take me out to dinner and buy me a pretty corsage. This is my first year going without a long-term boyfriend..it kinda blows. I'm not even motivated enough to buy a new dress, I'm wearin an old one. My library book is due tomorrow too. DAMNIT.

 Had an interesting day yesterday. Me and Alex went to Matt Keller's before she had to take off with Harmony, and there were like two cases there and they bought a quarter. I didn't really party, just drank one beer..I was still feelin icky. But some toothless guy named Travis kept askin me to ""flash him my tittis,"" but that was before he puked in the alley. 
 
 I feel like a druggie. Major. Like, I feel like the people that don't do any drugs at all, not even drink/smoke pot, want to be around me. Which I guess makes sense. But I'm really not a stoner. Yeah, I mean, I guess I smoke a lot of pot..but..I still have motivation. I have a job, I go to school (just sometimes stoned) and I am still a good student. Everyone makes every single pot head out to be some lowlife scum that doesn't leave their room and spends any penny they get on bud. That's really not how it is..
But that's how I feel people see me. That's how I think Chris McIlvenna is."

"event","Rawr. This pisses me off so bad. I just remembed because I was just listening to a Depeche Mode cd, and of course, there's that song..most of you know it.

 ""All I ever wanted, 
  All I ever needed,
  Is here in my arms.
  Words are very
  Unneccesary""
blahblahblah whatever. So, in one of my classes the other day one of those preppy kids (the ones that all started wearing Atreyu shirts and shit) was singing it to me, but he kept on leaving out the word ""ever."" I told him he was fucking it up, and he got all pissed off and was like ""YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE SONG."" And of course I do. All the bands have covered it, the most recent and popular is HIM, so I'm like, ""Yeah, HIM does."" And he's like ""Uhh no..it's Evergreen Terrace. You sure told me, SYKE."" I'm just so truly amazed by some people's stupidity. Him and all his friends laughed at me because they thought I was wrong, when really they're just total fake assholes who can't name more than 5 Atreyu songs. They made themselves out to be even BIGGER assholes. I let it go and shook my head. 

 I don't HATE anyone. But those are the people I highly dislike. Just like the other day, I wore an Alkaline Trio shirt to school. Some Freshman in my TA class was like, ""What, is that your boyfriend's shirt?"" And I go..""no..this is my shirt. I paid for it."" ""Yeah right, I see the way you dress, you don't even like those kind of bands. I bet you can't even name 2 songs.""
 I named at least 20. He shut up after that. 
 It just gives me less hope for the human race, that's all. All so judgemental. Who cares how I dress? I feel better with the way I present myself, instead of wearing baggy band shirts all the time. My BAD. I didn't know I wasn't following the TREND. I remember last year in my government class, some varsity football player was like ""HEY, ARE YOU GOING TO THE ATREYU SHOW THIS WEEKEND?"" And Dan Baker, that's right DAN BAKER, was like ""HELL YEA I'M AGO DAWG!"" Wtf. what happened to their pimp rap music? 

 I am just aggravated and don't want to do my homework. I have a 150 word paper to write responding to some stupid short story we read in Adv. Composition. I have been attempting to clean my room for like 2 hours, but I keep getting distracted. I think I've spent most of it sitting in my computer chair. Sigh. </3"

Everyone was havin fun and I made new friends, Ian was there with Rikki Diez and Kaitlyn Kirkpatrick? and shit. So it was cool. Devon and Mike Henry too. And Sean. hehee..So, Amber like starts crying and we all calm her down and I left at like 10:30. I guess at 1 the cops got called and like 5 people got taken away, and everyone else got kicked out. Like the party never ended. That's crazy.

 Another funny thing, I get home and my dad's like ""They were havin a good ass party."" I go..""What are you talking about"" ""When you called to check in on the answering machine you forgot to turn off the phone. I hear a lot."" haha. Funny shit. 

 I'm getting sick which sucks and I have laundry to do, but I really don't feel like sitting at home. </3"

You're outta my hair
It's growing just above my smiling face that I wear
Every night I drink myself to sleep
Not thinking about you
Not thinking about anything at all

I don't care who you've been dining with these days
It's more than fair
Much rather be drinking anyways
With my friend Peter
Who lives so fucking far away
Yet not as far as you
Even though you live right down my fucking street

And I'm tired of sleeping with myself
I'm tired, all these drinks and drugs no longer help
I'm tired of lying about not thinking of you
Maybe my friend Peter can tell me what to do

I dont care who you've been kissing on these days
It's out of my hands
and in my mouth with such a pleasant taste
I need a beer to wash it all away without a trace
And then i'll drink 23 more
To wipe this stupid smile off my fucking face

 I got stung by a bee in 3rd hour a couple days ago.

 See, I'm lame. I really have nothing fun to update about. We decided to go play volleyball for a couple hours once a week, on Tuesdays, and it bombed yesterday cause Missy and Becca got in a fight. So me and Becca just sat around and went to Erick's and got some food and then Brian called, so we went over there and sat and had a beer. It was nice. He's moving into an apartment soon, which means HOUSEWARMING PARTY! WOOHOO! I have nothing in my life to be excited about besides beer.

 Right now I just feel so hopeless of better days and more exciting times. Life will always be like this. Laid back, and boring. I feel no anticipaition for waking up in 20 years. I know that in 20 years I will just sit there, probably write in some other type of journal, and talk about how I'm still waiting for smiles and love and ""better days."" Because life is doing nothing but looking forward to things getting better."

"event","Went to Great Lakes Crossing today with Becca and Alex. Man, we shopped for like..hours. My legs are so sore. Which sucks, cause I gotta go to work tomorrow and bust some ass to make the money up for the shit I bought today hehe. I got 3 new shirts, new underwear :) (you can never have too much) and some jewelry. It was good times.
I'm debating on whether or not I wanna get my nails done tomorrow with Alex. I think I'll just dye my hair instead.
 I am going to clean my room thorougly tomorrow because I just saw like 3 ants. My room is always clean, there is no food up here, why have I seen like 10 ants in the last week? Maybe because we've seen em downstairs and they're making their way up.

  Sigh.
   I'm not really lonely or anything. It kinda makes me worry, that ever since me and Chris have finally like, parted ways..I haven't really had a boyfriend yet. I mean, I've been talkign with different guys..it's not like I don't get attention. There's just no one I'm interested in enough to try to start a relationship. But that's not what bugs me..what bugs me is the fact that I'm okay with it. That I haven't been lonely at all. That I just go about my day like nothing's weird."

 I have a whole new set of rules of regulations.

 First off, never taking the car again. My Dad will drive me to and from school, at his conveinence..which means he will drop me off at school an hour early and pick me up an hour late. He will not supply me with rides to work, I can walk the 1.7 miles or figure out my own form of transportation. He took my cell fone and house key, which means that if I do get home before he does, I have to sit outside and wait for him to unlock the door. If I do not eat dinner with them, I am not welcome to go in the fridge past 6 oclock. I have to be home every night at 9 oclock and am currently grounded on the weekends.

RiotGrrl 5 0 2: what is signifigant about that
RiotGrrl 5 0 2: it seems like it should be important
Complicated8624: september 3rd?
Complicated8624: i dont know
RiotGrrl 5 0 2: ah well
Complicated8624: wait
Complicated8624: is that today?
RiotGrrl 5 0 2: yeah
Complicated8624: oh yeah thats the day that sucks

 Definitley.

 A lot of shit has gone done today. Missy got caught being late last night and is grounded hardcore, and I got kicked out because I hit my Dad's bumper on his truck and indented it and lied about it, so I got kicked out. No sympathy asked for..it was my fault, I was stupid about it. Realization occured right afterwards. But, now I am homeless. And I don't think anyone deserves that, no matter how many bumpers you dent.

 I wouldn't really care if I didn't start school in two days, and had transportation to work. I already had to take off work tomorrow morning, I'm just praying they got my messages..sux. I think my Dad will offer for me to come back, which everyone thinks is wiser than me staying at my Aunt's, but..I'm thinking about emotional vs. materialistic. I was emotionally miserable at my Dad's all along, but yes, I had all the materialisitc things I needed. And here, it will be the opposite..I will have nothing but I will have love. It all sucks really bad. Basically if I go back to my Dad's, and I will be hated and not talked to but I will have clothes and food and shit. I don't know. It made more since my head cause I mean, I'll have clothes and food here too.

 But I'll be putting my aunt in a worse position. The one that drinks. She can't even take care of herself, she waitresses and raises a 12 year old son as it is..barely though. As much as she says she wants me to stay, I would make things worse. I would cost more money and make more chores for her.

 And of course, I am not finacially stable enough to support myself which scares me for the future. A year is not far away, and that is when I'll be gone. 

 I don't even have a fucking car."

 I made the mistake to read a couple.

 I would never really burn them. It just gave me that butterfly hurt feeling. I think it's because I know that he never has these moments. I did good at erasing him, and it was easier for him to erase me because of Brianna...but these stupid notes just bring him back. I'm scared to forget all the way, or else I would just toss them..but now they're looking at me, wanting me to read them. Every single one of them. But I think it'd just hurt too badly.

 The notes are the good times. The happy times. They'll make me remember Chris and forget the bad times.

Apparently, not only is it the whole ""family time"" thing, but he thinks I am living too much like my mom did. And that's where their personalities crash. I would rather be out with my friends then home with family (aka for me sitting on the couch/sleeping while they play the computer. sometimes they make dinner though.) and that is not the way to live because my money goes by so fast. If I cannot learn to entertain myself at home and count on my friends to do it, I will grow up to be a poor pothead. So he thinks. I have to get my lifestyle straight. Blahblahblah. 

 He already thinks I have 140 dollars saved while I actually have NONE. That's already a well off situation as it is, don't you think?

I spent like 30 bucks on her last night, on she kept telling me she'd pay me back on Friday, or whenever she got money..She got like 75 bucks today, and gave Matt 40 that she owed him, and she had an extra 10..And I asked her if she could pay me back cause like, I really needed it cause it was my fucking savings and she all freaked out. She's like. ""NO. I have 35 left and it's for ME. for pills."" So whatever. I really needed that money back..and I think she'll pay me back Friday, but, I coulda bought my mom pot with that money cause I lost the other shit.

 My mom should be here today. I just want to smoke like 1/2 a cigarette. Not like my throat/voice is fucked up enough or something.."

 Me and Lauren spent all day yesterday trying to roll, no dice. It was a waste. Today we are trying to get some, doubt it'll happen. Prolly just poke some smot..which I barely even like doing anymore. The feeling doesn't really interest me, it's getting old. It just makes me tired nowadays. I am just annoyed with drugs altogether. It seems like I think we have to take some to have fun, which is kinda true for me. A day just doesn't seem worthwhile if some sort of drug isn't involved. Going to play pool? Better be stoned. Gonna go to a party? Better be rolling. Hanging out with friends? Gotta get drunk.
 Money goes too fast and I can't buy anything for myself. No clothes or food or anything..just cigarettes. And drugs. 

 I really need to stop. But my day's just suck so bad. I can't help it. I was going to try to lay off, and then my Dad started hating me and threatened to send me North and pack my bags. He won't talk to me. So I just wanted out.

 My sister took me back to Ann Arbor with her last night, we had some nice times. Swang at the park, met her other roomies who were 21 year old lame drunk boys in a punk band, they were nice. We talked a lot. Maybe a little too much, actually..Before I went to bed I just kept thinking ""I can't believe I told her that.""

 In my computer class in 8th grade, we had an assignment to type out these sentences perfectly without any errors, and they should line up. One sentence didn't line up with any of the other ones, and I look it over like 5 times..nothing wrong. So I took it to the teacher.
 He found something wrong with all the other sentences, they were actually one extra character..and the one that didn't align was right.
  I was going to compare it to my life, but I can't word it right. If only I was rolling..oh man. Everything flows. But if you're smart, you'll figure it out.

 So, I gave some bullshit story so I wouldn't have to work this morning, I got called in tonight though.

I made 8 dollars in tips but got paid, an extra 15 bucks for workin 3 hours tonight..when it wasn't even really 3 hours cause I was late and my boss let me off an hour early to go to GFS for him to get cheese. hehe.

  My sister and I are talking about how weird it is that Elaine, my step mom, is turning 60 Aug. 3rd and looks so healthy. She excerises, eats healthy, all that shit. And we were talking about how ironic it would be if she died. So, her birthday comes around, and I wasn't living with my family, I was living with my Step-Dad's family..I guess. And Elaine has a heart attack. She doesn't die, but she's not doing well. I go to see her and she's at home in a hospital bed and doing ok. The next day, my mom calls me and tells me she walked outside and got murdered.
 I go see my Dad. He doesn't know he was supposed to call someone to get rid of the body, so we go to this hospital to find someone to talk to.
 It has all these different departments..like a jail, housekeeping, a mall? a Chuck E Cheese. It was nuts.
 So we find this lady and we ask her where to go. She makes up go up and down all of these sliding stairs and poles and shit..apparently the name of the room is 203 and the door is a box in the ground. She was laughing it up the whole time.

 She made us bring home an educational dead-family-video. It showed all these weird bodies and talked about the decomposition process and was talking about how dead bodies actually think they're still alive for a while, like zombies.

 Hung with my girls tonight. It was hott.  We met Tony, Mark, Ashley, and Lucas up at the pool hall. Corey and Nick showed too, and we saw Will, Megan, and Kevin. Kyle. Something. <--- he thought I was flirting with him. But he said he had liquor and I was like ""HEY LET'S HANG OUT. <3"" Cause that's just how I am. CHEAP AND I LIKE LIQUOR. And I told Chris Lucas to chill, hopefully he will too. I saw him tonight for the first time in like, 6 months. At first he was kinda like ""Hey fuck you."" or something, but by the end he was talking and being nice. yay. Until Mark and him drove by and pretended like they DIDN'T KNOW WHO WE WERE. Theyr'e too coooool for that.

 So suave. YEAH.

 Did I mention I'm stoned?

 At first I was just like ""Oh I'm sooo tired I'ma go home and crash like WHOA,"" but now I'm kinda like..energized. With the munchies. Even though I'm not hungry and I feel like if I eat I may puke, but it just sounds...so...good. My parents are sleeping anyways.


AHH IM MISSING AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE!"

"event","I hate work. Why, you may ask? Well. 
 They all speak Albanian and I can never understand what they're saying.
 The only lady that does speak okay English has a very heavy French accent.
 Only senior citizens come in, and they bitch if I pour too much coffee in their cup.
 My schedule is always changed somehow.
 They don't ask me if I want to change my schedule and be up at 8am, they just tell me how it is.
 I bust my ass and they tip me shitty.

 My stepmom is not talking to me because I didn't put butter in the butter dish, so she went to use butter for a piece of bread and it was not as soft as she would like it to be.
Fuckers.


 I just want to leave and not be at home, BUT NO. I HAVE TO BE AT WORK AT FUCKING 8AM.

 And my friends are cool. I call them and they're like ""OH DON'T BE SAD, WE'LL COME GET YOU!"" So when I'm sitting outside waiting for them they call back and are like ""Sorry I can't come get you, we're going to party at my cousin's house.""
Sweeeeet dude.
GOD.


And btw. WILL SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY AFI IS NOT PLAYING AT THE WARPED TOUR THIS YEAR."

 But now I'm not, because Ben still isn't around and my Dad forgot to tell me that my Aunt called to say that the family was coming over for dinner tonight and that I should come over.

 So.

I know I've updated too much today but I had to say this.
I called him and we were talking and he's like ""yeah, I think Becca likes me.""
Kristan : Yeah, but she also likes this Ryan kid.
Justin : So, I'll beat him up and then go out with her.
Kristan : He's a football player.
*sidenote* I don't really know if that's true.
Justin : So?
Kristan : And he's 21.
Justin : How old do you have to be to get stabbed? Cause I'm sure 21 is young enough.

<3 <3 <3 How I miss him.
He's supposed to call me Thursday, we'll see how that goes.

DONE UPDATING FOR LIKE, A WEEK. I SWEAR."

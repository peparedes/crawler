I'm atrociously lazy updating with pictures. I suppose some would be nice.

On second thought, no one ever reads this, which makes this text strange to be typing.


Holler if you have any thoughts regarding future posting of semi-recent pictures that make me giggly or reminiscent or blahblah."

"event","On Sunday, I worked with these 5 mostly obnoxious boys. We were setting up for a wedding and they were body slamming each other in between the tables. The lunch conversation migrated into strip clubs and bossman saying our homework was to get Phil wasted.

Then I went to San Ramon to see Adam and we went to Target to get CDs. We proceeded to get a collection of some of his very interesting friends and Eli was pushing me to go fasterfaster in the 0 visibility pouring rain.

We had puppy class on Monday and. I realized there weren't any pictures of Ches.

"event","Ah! Finally! I have reverted to last year and I am almost completely unbothered. It feels almost like it did when I was in Science and they kept coming in to our class with that stupid thing and I'm like. 'Uh...??? Lame?' I hate to be a NegativeNancy, but really. It's so intensely joyful to come to this realization, being freed and unblinded and unattached. 

Chesley was super today and I loveKendra.

Much love JenniferStupak. Come home soonish cause we need to roll fo sho.

On another note. Most everyone failed our Precal test, so we got to retake it. I didn't really feel like studying or doing anything, so I failed again. This semester is going to be tres difficule, so I might transfer out. I figured I could go to M&M but then I realized that class change would be atrocious. Kendra suggested TA'ing for her class. Killersauce.

AND I'M EMPLOYED. 17 DINERO AN HOUR. WOO."

In other news.
I went to Pastor Charlie's funeral today. Our church was overflowing and all the aisles were filled and people were standing and sitting on the sides and even into the entry area. Pastor Cork was there and I forgot how funny he was. Mrs. Poier asked me how The Used was. She's this tiny old lady who is so so nice and has this quiet, light, skipping voice. I'm a fan...and she said how her grandson is in a band in San Francisco and such. Then I drew cats in Pastor Tim's office for thrity minutes. Cats.cats.cats. 

But it was immensely grosso. On the freeway on the way home I was driving and I passed these Arab guys. And then they sped up and passed me and this like. Grosso.grosso. 50 year old Arab guy totally winked at me and I was like. 'Ew.' And totally slowed way down. How repulsive."

10 years ago..
I had this awesome teacher who had a twin. I got a pink card and had to stay in at recess for saying I couldn't understand the new Mexican girl. There was this kid Nam in my class whos Mom died and he was totally awesome. I remember him and Cathy both had Nguyen as last names. I spent five minutes making the & sign and I went up to show her and she says...'You have to write it out...'and' and erased it. I was mortified. At recess I lost my brand new earring underneath the sliding thing. I remember other kids would 'slam!' you and you had to try and catch it. On rainy days we ate in the cafeteria and you could buy pencils for a quarter.

5 years ago
I hung out with Lauren and Heather even though they hated me and I didn't like them much either. I was pretty weaksauce. Mr. Alfonso had us draw things all the time. Self portraits.Shading cones.Pen on Paper. And we made TV shows and did trust walks. I don't remember doing work ever...except correcting spelling tests. We were the 'GAY' kids and we sat at the top of the Nature Center near the black top at lunch.

1 year ago...
I loved Environmental Science most and I sat next to Hector and behind Rudy. Hector told me I could get a finger tattoo and the gangster kids wouldn't beat me up cause I was a little white girl. I hung out with Kendra and all her kids. I drank booze and I was actually pretty consistenly happy...except when I thought about my Grandma's death.  I got my permit and...ya.

Yesterday...
I watched four hours of Six Feet Under when I woke up at one. Then I made banana pancakes and  took out a zipper in one of my dresses. Later in the night I went to my Mom's friend Will's house and hung out with him...his son Zach and his grandma. I came home and Zarrinah was visiting and some guy named Jordan was there too. We stayed upstairs in Delilah's room till about 130 and they were dancing and telling jokes. They weren't themselves but it was funny. Zarrinah told me about her phone sex jobs...and then I took a shower and went to bed.

I'm pretty sure you NEED to go here.

<lj-cut text=""Chuck Norris recently had the idea to sell his urine as a canned beverage. We know this beverage as Red Bull."">
I saw this in various places. I couldn't keep it to myself.

Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.

Rather than being birthed like a normal child, Chuck Norris instead decided to punch his way out of his mother's womb. Shortly thereafter he grew a beard.

Chuck Norris sold his soul to the devil for his rugged good looks and unparalleled martial arts ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn't stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.

Chuck Norris won 'Jumanji' without ever saying the word. He simply beat the living shit out of everything that was thrown at him, and the game forfeited.

Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.

Chuck Norris once roundhouse kicked someone so hard that his foot broke the speed of light, went back in time, and killed Amelia Earhart while she was flying over the Pacific Ocean.

Chuck Norris's girlfriend once asked him how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. He then shouted, ""HOW DARE YOU RHYME IN THE PRESENCE OF CHUCK NORRIS!"" and ripped out her throat. Holding his girlfriend's bloody throat in his hand he bellowed, ""Don't fuck with Chuck!"" Two years and five months later he realized the irony of this statement and laughed so hard that anyone within a hundred mile radius of the blast went deaf.

Chuck Norris built a time machine and went back in time to stop the JFK assassination. As Oswald shot, Chuck met all three bullets with his beard, deflecting them. JFK's head exploded out of sheer amazement.

To prove it isn't that big of a deal to beat cancer. Chuck Norris smoked 15 cartons of cigarettes a day for 2 years and aquired 7 different kinds of cancer only to rid them from his body by flexing for 30 minutes. Beat that, Lance Armstrong.

Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.

Chuck Norris was the fourth Wiseman. He brought baby Jesus the gift of ""beard"". Jesus wore it proudly to his dying day. The other Wisemen, jealous of Jesus' obvious gift favoritism, used their combined influence to have Chuck omitted from the Bible. Shortly after all three died of roundhouse kick related deaths.

Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs.

The chief export of Chuck Norris is pain.

Chuck Norris is not hung like a horse... horses are hung like Chuck Norris

Chuck Norris lost his virginity before his dad did.

If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can't see Chuck Norris you may be only seconds away from death.

Chuck Norris does not have AIDS but he gives it to people anyway.

When Chuck Norris sends in his taxes, he sends blank forms and includes only a picture of himself, crouched and ready to attack. Chuck Norris has not had to pay taxes ever.

Chuck Norris can make a woman climax by simply pointing at her and saying ""booya"".

When Chuck Norris plays Oregon Trail his family does not die from cholera or dysentery, but rather roundhouse kicks to the face. He also requires no wagon, since he carries the oxen, axels, and buffalo meat on his back. He always makes it to Oregon before you.

Chuck Norris recently had the idea to sell his urine as a canned beverage. We know this beverage as Red Bull.

When Chuck Norris has sex with a man, it is not because he is gay, but because he has run out of women.

After much debate, President Truman decided to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima rather than the alternative of sending Chuck Norris. His reasoning? It was more ""humane"".

Chuck Norris once ate three 72 oz. steaks in one hour. He spent the first 45 minutes having sex with his waitress.

Chuck Norris once shot a German plane down with his finger, by yelling, ""Bang!""

The original theme song to the Transformers was actually ""Chuck Norris--more than meets the eye, Chuck Norris--robot in disguise,"" and starred Chuck Norris as a Texas Ranger who defended the earth from drug-dealing Decepticons and could turn into a pick-up. This was far too much awesome for a single show, however, so it was divided.

Macgyver can build an airplane out of gum and paper clips, but Chuck Norris can kill him and take it.

The word quadrillion was first implemented in a Harvard study to express the size of Chuck Norris's genitalia.

The House of Representatives recently passed a bill that requires every American thesaurus print ""Chuck Norris"" as a synonym of the word perfect. President Bush vetoed the bill yesterday despite its popularity, claiming, ""This man was a Texas Ranger? Heck I owned the Texas Rangers! I don't remember no one named Walker playin' for me.""

Chuck Norris frequently signs up for beginner karate classes, just so he can ""accidentally"" beat the shit out of little kids.

One of the greatest cover-ups of the last century was the fact that Hitler did not commit suicide in his bunker, but was in fact tea-bagged to death by Chuck Norris.

Chuck Norris appeared in the ""Street Fighter II"" video game, but was removed by Beta Testers because every button caused him to do a roundhouse kick. When asked bout this ""glitch,"" Norris replied, ""That's no glitch.""

There are no disabled people. Only people who have met Chuck Norris.

Filming on location for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away.  

Chuck Norris doesnt shave; he kicks himself in the face. The only thing that can cut Chuck Norris is Chuck Norris.

The quickest way to a man's heart is with Chuck Norris's fist.

One day Chuck Norris looked in the mirror and said ""No one outstares Chuck!"" He is still there to this day.

When Chuck Norris's wife burned the turkey one Thanksgiving, Chuck said, ""Don't worry about it honey,"" and went into his backyard. He came back five minutes later with a live turkey, ate it whole, and when he threw it up a few seconds later it was fully cooked and came with cranberry sauce. When his wife asked him how he had done it, he gave her a roundhouse kick to the face and said, ""Never question Chuck Norris.""

Chuck Norris likes to knit sweaters in his free time. And by ""knit"", I mean ""kick"", and by ""sweaters"", I mean ""babies"".

Chuck Norris once tried to sue Burger King after they refused to put razor wire in his Whopper Jr., insisting that that actually is ""his"" way. 

Chuck Norris thinks that cards are impersonal. To add his own brand of originality, he painstakingly makes a message out of tiny razors which he then attaches to his foot. When the lucky birthday boy/girl sees Chuck, he roundhouse kicks them in the stomach and delivers his well wishes in a present that will stay for life.

<b> Ha. This one is bad but it was a must. </b>
Chuck Norris wears glasses that make everyone look Asian. This is why he kicks so many people in the face.

Ask not what Chuck Norris will do for a Klondike bar, ask what the Klondike bar will do for Chuck Norris.

A little boy once dressed up as Chuck Norris for Halloween. When he rang Chuck Norris' doorbell, Chuck Norris was so excited that he gave the boy the whole bowl of candy. Two seconds later he roundhouse kicked the boy in the face and took it back.

The only man to defeat a unicorn in hand to hoof and horn combat was Chuck Norris.

I haven't updated on a day in quite a long time, but yesterday was an extremely enjoyable one.

<lj-cut text=""Yesterday Fo Sho"">

At 330. I went with Jennifer and Amy and Danielle to Los Altos. After some time went by...Jennifer and I ended up roaming Main Street. First old<b> Jemima, age 80,</b> came up to us and asked, 
     ""The hors d'oeuvres! Have you seen them? They're all supposed to be passing them out"" 
And we replied confusedly, 
     ""No, we don't even know about any hors d'oeuvres""

After walking around for some time, we ran into Jemima again and she recommended a place with fantastic chocolates and cookies. There, we met Rufus who assumed we were lovers. We found a book,<b> 'Cooking in the Nude: Just Married'</b> and decided it was a must-purchase for a later date in time. Rufus was a little slow, and responded with,
     ""The way you guys talk embarrases me!""
And Jennifer went on about how she was upset about gay marriage being illegal. She also inquired about the grapes on the wall, and Rufus told her all about how you can get them at Michael's. We learned how strong the coffay was and he was amused by me saying 'a smidge of cream.' We had to leave him though, and said later and we'd be back hopefully, to finish off some more greater than great cookies and chocolates.

As we proceeded further down the street...and ate food at the Optometry place...and Sylvia let us take pictures of her display...and got cheese at Treasures, as well as some wonderful fruit beads, we ended up at Winona's. Blonde hair and a nice European accent.
     ""Is this wine or cider?"" I asked her.
     ""Wiiiine...(sadface)"" she replied.
     ""Ouch. That's depressing""
     ""Ya...you have to be 21""
     ""Ya I'm trying to hold back anyway. So whatev.""
Then Jennifer replied something with an s sound. Winona thought we said ""Turning 21 on Saturday"" and got super excited and sang and danced to <b>'Turning 21 on Saturday! Turning 21 on Saturday!'</b> behind the counter as we walked out and around the store.

There we met up with Jemima again. And she asked us if we had any more recommendations. We said no, because we only went to where she recommended, and the rest was all wine if she liked it. She said that she wasn't really into it. And her husband (Standing nearby, eating cheese and not hearing very well) used to drink too heavily and it has affected his memory, and they were going to have some tests done. She told us to not drink, and tell all our friends the same. Her life story was told in less than a minute, and she even did that gentle wrist-touching maneuver as she was finishing. Jennifer and I both almost said 'Bye Jemima!' I will miss her.

Later we saw Maritzio, and Roger who plays the violin with scraggly hair. And don't forget Laquisha.


After Los Altos, we saw Amy's grandma who is fantastic. Next, we continued on to Shannon's house, where I beat Christopher up, and picked up Nicole and Shannon. Michelle couldn't contain her excitement, and I practiced hugging on her, Ian and Amber! who later sewed my purse in the middle of feeling our hip bones and dancing to cell phone tunes. Kendra was there and I touched her 'sensational ass' before I caught up with Mexican, as she filled me in on some things. Erica F is always enjoyable, and there were the likes of Kelly G, Derek (Who suggested I knew him from 8th grade ASB) Alex P and some others. 

After the football kids obtained the MVAL champion status, we went to In N Out where Ryan Berry and all sorts of other fellows were. There was even a man in the parking lot who didn't care that the door to his trailer-less semi-truck wasn't closed, and gave us the thumbs up as he walked away that we could get in. We climbed into the cab, and took dark cell phone pictures, before leaving for 'The Chill Spot' which required us going over a ginormous bridge over marshland West of 880 that I have strangely never been on. It was fairly exciting. I also realized that I used to go to 'The Chill Spot' with my Dad and brothers when we lived in the apartment and we'd walk on the levees and go fishing.

And then we came home. Oh joy!"

"event","I feel awfully dumb and skanky lately. 

Now, I have always thought it unfair that someone has a bad day, at no fault to you...and takes it out on you. Recently, I have lacked the energy and good-mood aura to smile back or wave or talk to most people, minus a few. These few were not there before, and strangely have filled some sort of bonding experience out of a crutch-like attachment and fondness. Anyway, normally, I would have believed I was a 'cheery, outgoing, spontaneous person.' In many ways, through various actions of mine, I held onto my 'childish innocence,' which they say is most important. Although, in other ways I did not.

Not upholding this is ultimately fatal and awful. I won't soon forget it. So now I am in this lame stage where I disregard most people's actions and attempts of being nice. I apologize to any who I haven't returned my awkward smiles to, if we indeed make eye contact. Or if I haven't returned your calls, as my phone has recently been on silent and left alone. Also, if I don't reply in the ways of text or through speech. This may sound retarded, but it really doesn't promote good feelings, and I feel gross for it. Perhaps I will soon give in and go to the all-unknowing doctors and they'll give me magical medicines. In which case, I hope they change my lack of regards towards others, back to my awkward efforts of being amiable.

Much thanks gangsters."

And I don't really want to explain the reason why it frustrates me. I'm pretty sure it has to do with confusion and difficulty and lacking and many other reasons.

"event","A few days ago, I was sitting on the brick driveway of my grandparent's house, overseeing the records book for the estate sale.

Along came an old man on a raggedy grey bicycle. His worn pants were tucked into his worn socks, which were placed in his frayed shoes. After purchasing his fifty cent roll of tape, he placed it in his tattered backpack, choosing not to put it in his grocery bags which hung on the handlebars. His pockets were already overflowing as well. Before his departure, he put on a round skateboarding helmet and gardening gloves, and retrieved his bicycle from the dirt. Through the gates and down the street he went, to the rest of the sales in Los Altos, his habitual Saturday activity.

If and when I get old, I hope I'm as gangster as that old man. And if not, then I want to enjoy five porch years, before become an actual gangster in sweat suits who participates in drive-by's in the ghetto for those who mug a nigga."

(Some are random. Most are not.)

1: You were always fat...or chubby and wanted to bone me. Now you're not and I wanted to bone you. But now we just don't talk much.

2: Your personality was awesome. Lately you've been a dick, but I'm pretty sure I still love you. Not as much. There was a big fat disappointment there though.

3: The thought of you on me repulses me. But other than that...you're pretty gangster. I genuinely missed you after a month.

4: You're completely hilarious most of the time. But you are often very frustrating since you're oblivious or clueless about a lot of things. Plus you keep leaving.

5: Although I once thought you uncomplicated, I realized otherwise, and it was incredibly frustrating. I think I might have overcome that now...and you're pretty much my favorite. I wish you'd bang me already. At a convenient time. 

6. I'm completely scared that you're avoiding me. In a few months, I won't have seen you for two years and that's awfulawful. I hope you're just being a slacker like always.

7. You and your humor and goodness and dogs are hilarious.

8. I totally wanted to go to the South in the summer to get wasted with you, and hang out with the gangster fam.

9. You're the cutiest oftentimes. And those pants and that shirt when you wear them are totally hott. No doubt. 

10. You and your kid of the same name are hilarious, although frustrating. I remember I used to want to bone you. But now I'm pretty sure I wouldn't."

Every other dead end you turn right and the others, left.
If no direction from the list is made after 5 minutes...do the same as above and continue.

We ended up in Santa Clara. We didn't exactly know where we were...except for the occasional main street. We figured it out when I was like... 'Hey! There's my Dad's police station.'

Then I went to my little half-beaner cousin's house in Milpitas. They're one and two and they were wrestling. It was like...cutie. The older one grabbed my face and scratched my eye. But ya. Playing with them is killer. Then we went Chili's.

This is a school assignment.
I detest poetry.

I'm told to write down
my adjective

So I think
and think
very adamantly

And ponder
if I should write down the whole truth
because I have an answer in my head

I have ma mere
Lenient and gentle
Who remembers that strict rules 
don't usually promote good character
and plans often change

I have two grandmas
One with squishy hugs and a smoker's laugh
The other with sophistication
who shares my interest in aesthetics

I have three brothers
who turned me off
to lots of frilly things
One who is successful and outgoing
smart and cosmopolitan
which I strive to be

I have people who sing songs
and make for moments 
of enthusiasm
and active rhythmic movements

A family of coffee and cigarettes
with witty words
and talk of the world ending

I have all these things to remember
Thoughts and influences
and places

They tell me to write down
who I am
and I think 
very intently

if I should write down the whole truth
or what I can think of
because I have answers in my head

There's Seattle where I always go
Full of rain and independence
Plants and water and sleepiness

There's Thailand where the world is different
Where Malee is from
With spicy food 
Where age doesn't affect law
and everything is mashed and exciting

I have journals and books and lists
so the uncomprehensible
can be remembered

I have my original iPod for love
Soymilk and organic food for health
Kraut Bracht for Christmas
Coffee and pills for life

I have all of it
All that makes my self
But I stop

and lazily write down strange."

This morning we went back to the Mansion place cause we were gonna go in the basement. But these Mexican worker guys were there and spoke minimal English and were doing Mexican smiles and we told them our Grandma used to live there and we came from Oklahoma to go see it.

Then I went to Massachusetts with Kendra and saw my negro Glenn. Only for a few hours but at least it happened. Our sizes are exxagerated when we're next to each other. So that whole area has bunchloads of trees. Trees and trees and trees. We went to Maine too and spent time on the lake and such. I exposed myself to Kelly cause my bikini repositioned itself under the life jacket when I fell off tubing. Boston has some killer brick buildings with ivy and mansions I can't comprehend. 

I flew through Minneapolis by myself on my way to Montana. The Minneapolis airport is like a mall and I had fantastic apple cobbler at TGI Friday's. I arrived in Montana and Dan picked me up in his big-o truck he rented. I had all these different waiter boys coming around every five seconds cause it was slow. They were all unique. Don't forget the gay one and the dreadlock one and the skinny ones and the blonde ones and the funny one.

In Montana I got in a super water fight with Malee and Michelle and won. They complained about the lack of coffee since it wasn't nonstop. They have killer views there and we went to a snow-water-lake an hour up a dirt road to a fantastic cabin I'd love to go back to. Alice...the owner and a relative is over 90+ and sharp and funny and awesome. I'd love to hug her. Chance swam to save Michelle...which was surprising because he detests it. Far too. And many of my cousins and relatives are 6'8 and one is like. 15.

Anyway. I got many bug bites in Montana and we drove home through the desert and fields for two days. Chance kept repositioning himself and twitching and breathing heavily in his sleep in the hotel bed. I will miss him when he goes. Completely and utterly because he is my favorite. Marie Claire.French. Urusula.German. Hilarious and friends and can hardly understand each other and smoke and drink and gamble and hilarious. I ate three huge platefuls at Cactus Pete's casino buffet in Jackpot, Nevada.

'So. What are you up to a pack a day now, Dad?' at the Snake River crossing.

Well. I've seen David.Kendra.Chris.Chris.Shannon. since I've gotten back which is swell.

These are pictures of the crew +Chris on marker/hose/dinner on the patio day. And my half beaner cousins.

"event","So. <b>Seattle</b> was most fun. Whenever I go I remember that most places are not swarming with other races. Hey! There was some family controversy...original hott people. Long boring speakers. Interesting hot tub situations. Boring dorm room stays...of which resulted in the idea I need a haircut and Kendra strangely layering half of it. Wearing it down isn't an option right now.

I can't stand my father and he makes me want to cry. I won't see my madre for a month.

Anyway. Blah blah blah. Yesterday I went to the beach with some of my cousins and aunts and Uncle. I brought David...and Kendra's unreliablity sadly resulted in her not coming. We were bummed. Anyway. That was swell. And I almost got his shorts off in the hot tub...so he finally went out and got the towels.

So. Yes. Pictures?

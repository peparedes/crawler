Javi was the one who went with me to tha hospital. Julio wnated to come but since javi dont knw shit, javi was informed by someone and came into my wing and me and julio are on the same wing so when javi came julio had to lay off for a lil which meant the whole time and so he was mad that javi wasnt leaving pero i was like he knows me and you are friends so why tha fuck couldnt you stay there with me? i was mad ass hell. so julio just kept walking by and starring and shit and then when they had to cary me out thats when he was mad scared and was like what tha fuck is going on? and he was heated cause he wanted to take me. pero yeah. how was reynis party? i told you that the boys werent gonna fight an dthat it wasnt that serious. who went? yo ara about that mariela thing. dotn even let it get to you. shes just fucking dumb. let her think whatever. pero at the same time you know howi say that i dont ever look at something one way cause you just cant do that, well maybe you and victor did something to make someone say something or acted a certain way. u know. im not saying yall have anything cause i know yall dont pero just keeo your distances i guess, no eso de k no se hablen pero i hope you know what your distance is. people in nashua talk too much shit so you cant just listen and stress what they say. they aitn nobody. k se vayan pa la mieldah. u kno. pero im out. i love yall.

Okay, who tha fuck is this Roman? i never heard of the dude ever. im soo confused. okay. Javi dont get mad at me when i smoke anymore cause he knows that im not gonna stop and its not like im childish abotu it. i know how to hang when im high. I have like only three more days to wait till my baby comes to school. Yay. i cant wait. pero anyways, illy, about that boy andrew, he seriously needs to chill with that shit talkignbout chosing. he met you like that and there aint no need to change por k te conocio asi. K se deje de esa mielda. Hes being a hipocrit por k if he is so down for his religion and knows that he needs to stick by it, why would he want someone to do that. Thats like being untrue to yourself. u know. Just be smart about it. About Juan, i cant believe the dude. thats nasty man. Ughhh. Yuckkkkky. why he always on that bitch. Yuck. i cant believe i even bothered with him before. He needs to get his priorities str8 cause hes never gonna move on from that shit aka SpongeBob ""Square"" Pants. Literally. lol.Hes another Isabel. About the fact that i cheat on Javi, well i was one to say he dont ove her if he cheats on her. Pero since i was in the situation, i cant really explain it but its somethings that happens a lot. And like you said that thats just somethign that happens to you as a test to see how u value your partner. U know, its true now that i think of it pero some people use that another way. They cheat to just cheat because they have no respect for themselves and their partners. Its true. Pero ya. me and Julio are still doing good and handling our situation like grownups. Its gotten so much better (""our friendship"" i know ara prolly is thinking something else if and when she reads this.)that we dont really have asituation anymore. I love that kid. hes such a sweet heart. He even wrote me aletter telling k me quiere mucho y agradece el tiempo k pasamos juntos y lo k paso con nosotros fue especial y sabe y acepta k aunque nada pudo pasar entre nosotros el sabe k pudiera ser algo especial. I was like awwww. hes such a sweet heart. i mean i do care for him pero we both know that we cant force shit to happen. it will only happen if its meant to be. Pero i miss Javier so frickin much. u like that Frickin huh. lol. Yeah, i miss my baby. i mean it took me until like two day ago to realize how much i miss him pero i really really do. I cant wait to see what is gonna come of us. hes my baby. Tan bello. anyways, dile a chilli that i love her and i miss her. i like never call her, pero i never really call anybody either. thats my lil girl. i miss yall. mauhzzzz. Ara has to call me to let me know what happened with her and willie. why was the fighting? Yo speaking about fighting, i wanna fight sooo bad. Tha colombain girl Jennifer, well her and her sister and rendons sister were talking shit to my sister. yari already fucked up Michelle so why them two bitches getting in that shit. i dotn give a fuck how old they are but i know i can and im going to fuck up Jennifer and if i see rendons lil sister ima say something cause them bitches egged my sisters windows on Halloween night. And then the day after they were going up to my sisters window and knocking and Jennifer was talking shit to her. Jennifer is a big girl. I swear to mother fucking Gosh, if she touches my sister k la mato. Te lo juro. i was getting so ready to just go home that night yari told me that shit. pero my mom got heated and went to their house and was liek whats good? and that girl of course was like yari does this and blah blah blah an my stupid ass mother believed her. i cussed my mom out on the phone last night for it cause she grounded Yari. I was like you stupid bitch si yari ya le dio la pela a esa nena por k carajo la estas castigando ahora canto estupida. i was jus going off. and she knows that if i get agood job when i get out i told her that ima take Yari from her cause i dont want yari to have to deal with her shit the way i had to even thoug yari gets spoiled. i know ho my mom is. i dunno if i told yall about taking my sister in with me before pero now you know. but yeah i was just buggin out on my mom for being stupid and she sounded like she was crying and she was like dejame hacer lo k yo quiera con MI hija y no te preocupes. and gave the phone to yari. I was like what tha fuck. she said it as if yari was a possession. it got so mad. i aint even gonna call her. she could suck my dick. pero yeah. thats whats up with me. Yo i need yall to do me a favor, if yall se Vanessa Cruz please ask her about what happened to her coming here. tell her its not too late. i dunno pero lately i've been worrying baout her. como k tengo un sentimiento k halgo aint right. i wish i could help her pero she aint got a phone or anything. pero si la ven tell her k me llame please. im out yall. i wrote enough for right now. i might have more to write about later. lol

Maybe u were just in a bad mood and just decided to take it out in the journal on us. tahst what i get out of that lil journal entry u wrote. and what u talking btou relationships are 50/50??? i think we all give the same and maybe we just have other things to handle at times and thats why u feel like  u give more. well i really dotn knwo what to say about taht. and your a front. ever since i came here we only spent one day together and thats fucked up cause i fucking calle dyou more than once and u just didnt pick up and fuck that bullshit that u was sick or tired cause u had time to text message people. thats fucked up. u supposed to be my best friend. i found out shit about you that wouldnt be such a big deal if i found out by you ""my best friend"" instead of otehr fuckin people. pero no i found out by others and dont even sit there and wonder abotu what they are cause im not even gonna fuckin talk about it until i feel like talking to you cause u grimey reyni. u supposed to be my best friend. this shit goes back in your fuckin face abotu the fifty fifty bullshit, i fuckin fill you in with everything in my life and u dont seem to be doing the same shit. maybe you sooo deppresed cause you decide to keep too much shit to yourself for some odd reason and since no one knows about it u feel like you cant takl to anyone and thats your fucking fault. pero fuck all this shit. i aint writing in here anymore. im out. im leaving saturday btw. if you actually called me and had a convo for more than two minutes you would know.

"event","Butterfly 
by Mariah Carey 

When you love someone so deep
that they become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You've given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me
When you're ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

So flutter through the sky
Butterfly.. fly
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly"

"event","hey gurls. its been a long ass time that i havent written in this but i will be doing it more often considering we got a new computer that actually works lol. so as some of you know me and monet took on the big City of NY!!! so we got there on friday about 11:30 i was suppose to meet that kid andrew and i went with my cousin desiree to meet him on 42nd street which is full of store and people mind you we forgot to put a meeting spot that was our bad. i was trametized that day. on our  way in the train there was this pink pink pink and i was trying to look at him cuz you know lol. but there was this white man staning up in front of us holding the railing and my cousin looks at him and shes like omg ileana miralo lo tiene parado!!! his was so fucking hard it was so nasty and we start dying laughing then she looks agaun and shes like hay dios lo ta mobiendo!!! el estaba parado y lo estaba mobiendo!!! it was so nasty!!! so we were walking around time square for about 2 hours and didnt end up finding him so me and my cousin end up giving up and headed back home. monet was with LEO and she wanted to get layed lol but she couldnt because she had her period. anyways she went out with some of our cousins to this party and they all drank but me and my cousin desiree decided to stay home. Sat. i find out that my cousin is pregnant which means when aracelis' grandmother read me la tasa era ella la muchacha que esta embarasada. yo pensaba que eras tu cyd pero anyways yo fui con ella al hospital and there was this SUPER HOT PINK emt guy in the emegency room DAMN!!! that nigga looked good. i told my cousin que yo me debo de enfermar para que el me rescate lol. all these guys on the street were shouting and shit and i wasnt paying attention. then on sunday a big day. well me and monet met andrew and this time we picked a spot we met at old navy on 34th street. i met him hes such a cutie and he has a nice nice nice nice nice ASS! so i kept grabbing it lol. anyways~> me and monet had to go to qeens to meet this kid jon jon's (monets lover in dr) mother i remed that andrew works in queens and how we werent that sure of how to get there i decided to follow him to his work and once were in queens we can then find our way from there. so we get to queens and we went to the pay phone to call jon's mother to tell her were we are and how to get to her house from there. while were at the damn pay phone this expedition full of these nasty guys pulls up to us and they're talking away mind you were not paying attettion to them. i start flipping out and them monet got scared shes like girl we can get killed for this over here but i wasnt thinking. anyways we made it there ok it was abit complicated but we got there. on monday i thought i was slick since i got us home that night and i got us around queens i thought i was supper woman or something and that i could get us to brooklyn where andrew lives. we got so lost on the train well we took it way too far and ended up almost near the beach we got half way and we got lost inside the train station for like 20 mins. then we had to take train 4 for one stop so we can then take the j train. after that we were ok we got of the stop closest to his house but the problem was how to get to the house! so we found these nice people who told us how to get to ten echk walk we were looking for the street. i asked them if that was a bad place and they told me no. when we get by there we were by these HORRIBLE projects i wanted to die i thought they were gonna kill us we used the pay phone told andrew were we were but his grandmother new it was bad and didnt let him walk there so we had to walk all the way back up its like walking from my house to reyni's  we get on broadway and called and then i spoke to his dad and he told me how to get to were they lived and they were gonna start walking to meet up with us. when we can see them down the street we only thought that him and his dad and sister were gonna come but then we see another person and its his mom who use to be kinda a bitch. so i was shitting myself he introduced us and she was like oh lets go back to the house to meet the grandmother who is really bitch and picky!! i was gonna drop dead when i was walking in the house but once we were in there she was sooooo nice and his mother too everything went well alot better than i ever imagined. we left at 8 at night and didnt meet up with andrew till 12:30 you though getting lost in boston in a car was bad try getting lost in brooklyn when you have never been there and walking!!! horrible. his dad is a taxi driver so he hooked us up he call a friend and got him to drive us back for 22 dollar its normally atleast a 30 dollar ride that was the worst feeling ever beeing lost and not knwoing how to get home we didnt get home till like almost 2 in the mornign to then take the bus at 7 am the next day!!! but i loved it i love NY i wanna go to school there after a year or two and i dont know i could possibly move there after college but i love you girls muahz byue bye"

I'm so jealous! then I went home and we were chillin in front of my house and Rhony and Fernando came over.  Stupid shit kept happening and it was funny thou.  Fernando looked like a caveman n then he was acting like one too, i kept making fun of him.  They were complainin that we never call them n invite them.  Then the guys picked up el primo (julian) n Carlos got dropped off.  Carlos was being an ass to Monet n he didnt even talk to her.  He kept trynna flirt wit me but I kept reminding him of Monet.  he was being so stupid!  I hope Monet doesnt think I was flirting with him cuz I wasnt..  I kept tryna keep my distance.  After my house Monet el primo MOnets cousin Carlos n me went to Greeley Park and Carlos kept being stupid there too.  He wanted to take a pic wit me and he was leanin on me askin me to give him a back massage n shit.  I feel so bad cuz thats how me n Carlos were when Monets not there.. like we act like that but when shes there i dont like to do that cuz thats disrespect.. how was i supposed to know that they would start talkin again?  I just dont want her thinkin theres somethin between us, thats all.  so much shyt happened yesterday but it was  stupid lil shit that i always notice n stuff.  nothing fuera de serie u know?

Monet doesnt want to.. i wonder why.. lol.  Friday i went to work n then got to nashua and went to the restaurant with ara, monet, illy n julian.  it was fun, we danced so much..  saturday afternoon i went to julian n carlos to sprint and we were talking it was nice.  carlos told me that he thinks that he is gonna end up fallin for Monet and I think thats why hes scared of gettin wit her.  julian told me when i dropped him off that he was gonna call me lada so we could chill.. me ara monet n christy ended up going to the restaurant, it was fun cuz we kept dancign and Jose (Carlitos friend) kept beign mad nice to us.  I had to leave for a bit to drop off Julian n Carlos at their house and Julian  was all like we wanna chill wit u guys but u guys dont wanna chill wit us.  I told him that it was too late he should of called us earlier like he said he was.  It was like 11:30, if he wanted to chill wit us he could of called like at 8 or 9 but he was too busy smokin up.  On the way to Julians house we stoppped at Cristians cuz Jose n some guy named Chupas were there.  Carlos almost blows up my spot in front of Jose.. n u know how noisy Jose is.. he would of told everybody.  I remember i was leaning on Joses car n I was like ""oh those are the people who threw that brazilian party that day.""  and carlos was all like ""yea, that was teh day u were all over u know who.""  I wanted to die right there.  i was like OMG!  Thank God he didnt say the name or I would have been so mad.  i dont even know how he knows cuz he wasnt there.  i know it was 3 of the socios but he wasnt one.  he must of found out by someone else.  but who?? the ones that were there arent ones to talk..there were other people there that could have told him.. oh well.  i cant be stressing that shit.  carlos will tell regardless i know him.  So much drama.  Sunday i just chilled wit the girls.. its so weird cuz Illy n Monet aitn talking but ill let Illy tell u why they dont talk.  Carlos was beign an ass to Monet yesterday.  we were supposed to go to a party at Chupas house last nite but CArlos called me too late.  i stayed up till 1:30 talkin to Monet on the phone n i forgot to call Ara back ( sorry! i still love u pq!!)  im not talkin to Chilly.. i called her yesterday n she told me that i only call her to ask her for something so i hung up on her.. i call her to invite her to places or i tell her bout us chillin or a party but she never comes.  idk.  i cant always be calling her, she never calls me unless i called her first n shes returnin my call.  i know shes busy but still u know..  she could make an effort.  i used to go to sleep late cuz i used to go to her house after she got out of work n watch a movie wit her at like midnite on weekdays when i would have to wake up early to go to work the next day.  i coudl of been like fuck it n been home sleepin, u know?  pero si, idk.  well i think i wrote a long boring book so im out.. love u wr2wd2 q4l kk OBU baby!!"

OMG, for those of u who werent there, let me give u the Reader's Digest version of what happened this weekend.  Me n Cyd wanted to make Ara think that this was gonna be the worst weekend ever n that her bday was gonna sux- nothing we planned to make this weekend be sucky could have turned out better!!!  I lied to Ara n told her I was gonna be in Providence this weekend and that Cyd wasnt coming..Bueno, friday me n Illy went to Beantown to pick up Cyd from the bus station, and hell yea, we got lost.  Big time!! we got to Boston at 6:30 n at 9:30 we still hadnt found South Station, I wasssssssssssss sooooooooooo heated and so was Illy n poor Cyd was stuck at the station allllllllllllllll byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhherssssselffff..  Finally Javi picked her up and we met up at 10:30, four hours after arriving at the city.  Then, we got lost again tryin to get back to Nashua n ended up everywhere- Hampton Beach, Greenfield, south MA, u name it, we were there!! Yo, at one point I was gettin ready to jump out the car- no lie!!  We made it home at 2 a.m.  Saturday morning was the best part of my weekend, I went wit Cyd n her family to the lake and it was fun n relaxing.  Saturday nite sucked thou!!  We couldnt get tickets to the Colombian party and we didnt have anything else to do..  We literally called up half of Nashua and drove around trynna find something.  Sunday, me n Cyd died our hair and at nite I went to Chillys house and Cyds house n I chilled with Illy n Monet for a lil bit.  That was my weekend in a nutshell.. How was urs??

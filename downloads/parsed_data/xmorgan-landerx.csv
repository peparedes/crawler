"event","Have you all missed me? I know I've been missing like really bad. It's been about 4 months I think? Wow. Okay, I don't have an excuse to why I've been so busy...but you know what I'm back. Hopefully for good.

My little sister is getting married. So ummm, I must stay around. I'm so sorry for not being around girl, I will somehow make it up to you.

And so yeah thank to Jayce for finding me from under my rock and waking me up from reality. Haha.

Now all I have to do is remember my SN! *nods*"

"event","But, I'm sick. I've got to get my tonsils out. *frowns* It's going to hurt. But this is also I good thing because now I won't have to hurt anymore. I didn't know why I had such pains when I was singing and why my throat hurt so much. 

It looks like we will have to canceling the tour. Ah, well I guess that's alright because I see how happy Mercedes is with Bizzy, and I only want her to be happy. If she's happy, I'm happy...okay that's a total lie. I need a man now. Life just isn't complete when you got a guy like Merce does. *laughs a little*

Well, I'm getting my surgery today and I have 1 week to recover...

Wish me luck.

See you all soon.

"event","It's been a long time since I've updated. Heck, I hardly ever update. My I saw my sister requested for me so I thought hey, I'll be nice and update. 

So, I think me and my sis should hang out or something again... what do you think? I miss her muchly.

Well, a lot has been happening with you people. That's why I'm not really on. But now that I think about it, I think I should. Maybe I could be the boss and have y'all listen to me. *laughs* Well, that's all from me. 

Talk with you all soon!"

"event","Aren't you all so proud of me? 

Well, right now my life pretty much as nothing going on. Kinda feels like Kittie is on hiatus because of me not doing anything. I got to get on more and talk to Mercedes. She's not just my sister but my best friend and bandmate; I can't say how much I appreciate her.

-shrugs-

That's and update from me, I'm guessing. Chat with you all soon."

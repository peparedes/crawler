"event","So we got back from DC on Monday after 3 days. What a cool fucking town. I could never live there, but it sure is fun as hell to visit. Tori was an amazing host, and has an amazing apartment. It is in this highrise that looks more like a fancy hotel than a place to live. But hey the government pays for her to be there so what the fuck. Friday night was kinda just a chill and have some drinks after 13 hours in the car. We got lost briefly getting to Albany to collect Krissy, then again for a few min. in DC (ghetto in DC when you are white is a bad place to be ) <br />Sat. we got up, sat around for a little while drinking coffee, while me, Tori, and Krissy chain-smoked, swapping stories. Krissy is by far the coolest story teller ever. After that we went and saw all the touristy shit. The capitol, washington monument, lincoln memorial, vietnam wall ect. ect. Ate at a kickass mexican place. We met up with Beth's friends Derek, and Sara and headed to a bar called the brickskeller <a href=""http://www.thebrickskeller.net/_wsn/page3.html"">http://www.thebrickskeller.net/_wsn/page3.html</a>&nbsp;(this is the beer list, over 1000 beers!) Yeah can you say shitfaced? We went back to Tori's. Beth passed out while me, Tori,Krissy and Derek talked about music and what not. Tori and Derek quickly faded, so it ended up with me and Krissy drinking and talking till 4am. Like I said she tells the best stories.<br />Sunday we went to brunch at a cool Irish pub and met&nbsp;Beth's cousin Mark and his scary wife. He was super cool, she made me want to claw my eyes out every time she opened her mouth.<br />We went to Arlington Cemetery, and spent a couple hours wandering around. If you want a truely moving experience go here. It is really something else. We visited JFK's grave, joe Lewis's grave, The tomb of the unknown soldier. It was real cool watching the guard in front of the tomb. He walks 21 paces at attention, stops, turns, clicks his heals, waits 21 seconds in salute, switches his rifle to the other shoulder and repeats these steps for an hour till he relieved by another guard. Tori said they were asked to stand down during one of the hurricanes for their safety and they refused. When they take the honor of this detail they have to agree never to swear, drink, or smoke for the rest of their lives. Pretty fucked up.<br />After we left Derek and Kriss went to get his car which apperently had been moved due to filing for the west wing. It took them the better part of 3 hours to track it down. I would have been bullshit if someone had moved my car 15 blocks away. The worst was that the people who moved it totally didn't keep track of it so they had no clue where it was. If one of the cops had not been a navy guy (Derek is in the navy and had to be back on base by 5am the next morning or he was in some serious shit) they would have gotten no help finding his car.<br />So they found it, we ate, laughed till we hurt, and went to bed. The next morning we climbed back in the car and headed back. This time it only took 11 hours to deposit Krissy in Albany and make it back home.<br />Fucking great weekend. I will post pictures as soon as I can get them off my phone. I love how you buy a brand new razr and you have to spend another 70 bucks on the usb cable and software to upload the pictures you take on it.<br />motherfuckers"

Get psyched!!!

Not much going on lately. Working a shitload the past couple weeks. I have 2 new jobs so no more mall hell YAY!!!!!
Things are amazing with Beth and just keep getting better and better. I realize that I have the most amazing g/f in the world. I got to work Warped Tour this year again. It was fun but not many bands I was really into this time around. I did get to work the stage that Bane was playing on which was amazing. They sounded better than I have ever heard them play. I got introduced to a new band that was amazing as well, Chuck Brunswick. Check em out at www.myspace.com/chuckbrunswick
We are playing Sept. 11 with Stretch Armstrong @ the Kave in fucksport which should be fun as shit. We are also going into the studio in the next month or so with legendary producer/engineer Don Fury in Brooklyn NY. I am so fucking psyched for this it is not even funny.
Thats it for now. Back to work I go.
PEACE!"

"event","<P>...... and I could care less about the lower east side!""</P>
<P>So its been awhile, but since it was an eventful weekend I figured what the fuck. Here we go....</P>
<P>Sat. night me and Beth met up with this lovely young lady from NY. Her name is Tory and she rocks.</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 161px; HEIGHT: 131px"" height=950 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v18/Jay_Lowlife/tory.jpg"" width=1047>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tory and Beth</P>
<P>We had lots of drinks and got absolutely wasted.</P>
<P>Sun. I had the kiddos then we had a show at the station with The Bars who were AMAZING, the Kill Takers who were amazing as well. Shitty turnout but fun show. Watching Darren hit on Tory was the best part of the night. Darren is a skate punk that thinks he is Bam. Irritating YES, annoying Yes, but harmless and fucking hilarious. He physically kissed my girlfriend's ass at one point trying to get her to buy him a beer. Funny shit.</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 137px; HEIGHT: 182px"" height=350 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v18/Jay_Lowlife/scurvy.jpg"" width=124>Darren&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG style=""WIDTH: 256px; HEIGHT: 188px"" height=786 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v18/Jay_Lowlife/how.jpg"" width=819>Darren and Tory</P>
<P>2nd night of &nbsp;lots of drinks and absolutely shitfaced</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 323px; HEIGHT: 271px"" height=228 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v18/Jay_Lowlife/beth.jpg"" width=51>wasted Beth and I</P>
<P>Mon. I fucked around downtown for awhile then we headed to Lewiston to play at Legends. Cool club, shitty bands (they were mostly death metal bands) shitty crowd. We all left not too long after we played.</P>
<P>Tue. we played in Auburn at the legion hall and it was amazing. A fucking great show, semi-decent turnout, lots of good mosh, lots of people singing along with our shit, just a fucking fun set. All the bands sounded great, alot of old and new friends. Just an all around great show and by far the best show of the 3 day stretch.</P>
<P>We hopefully head out on tour down the eastcoast for a week the end of July with our bro's On The Outside so that should be fun.</P>
<P>ps........................</P>
<P>June 18th SLAPSHOT!!!!!!!! that will be an amzing show I am sure.</P>

"event","wow it is really shitty outside right now. I am glad Sara is the sweetheart that she is and picked my ass up to hangout so that I did not have to take the bus home. I have really had enough of winter, I just want it to be warm and nice again.
We all went snowboarding yesterday and I hurt like hell today. I am pretty sure I broke my ass, but I can't wait to go again. After the initial horror of coming off the chairlift and looking down this huge fucking moutain that I was supposed sail down on a snowboard, it was fun. I need to work on my turning and stopping skills next time since I had a hard time with both of those.
4 more days of vacation left, it is going by way too fast.
Till Death will be recording soon. I will post when we have the date so people can come and do back up vocals if they want.
keep you all posted."

I went snowboarding for the first time ever today. It was fun after the first run. I fell SOOOOOOO many times and am sure I will be super hating life tomorrow morning. I have tons of road rash on my back from bailing so many times and I am pretty sure I sprained my wrist but fuck it I had a blast. Luckily Janna is good and very patient, since I def. made her, Sara, and Jockins wait while I fell down the mountain.

We went shopping today, I actually got MOST of my x-mas shopping done. Which is much diferent from most years when I am at walmart x-mas eve trying to get ALL my shopping done. I got the kids the ninja turtle sewer lair playset, they will be super excited.
In other news I am getting a car sometime this week. It is a '93 Ford Festiva. Not the most pimp ride but it will get me where I need to go and more importantly it is FREE. I am really stoked about this, hopefully I can get it on the road in a couple weeks when I can pay for insurance and registration and all that happy horseshit.
Now Sara is singing about her ghetto tree, so it is time to go watch TV.

I will live and die and love and cry quietly and unnoticed. I will have bled, upset my pathetic life in constant confusion. I will have searched, realized that the truth never existed while it lay undiscovered before me. I will have learned, dumbed by a false truth that all is irrelevent. I will have cowered, incapacitated by an instilled fear. I will have hate, known the fury and motivation of it. I will have despaired, daily destroyed by my own futility. I will have bled, drank vital from humanity because of my birth. I will have consumed, killed for my own waste and greed. I will have loved, revered the joy and the pain of it. I will have produced, felt the slavery and the empowerment of it. I will have cared, consumed on occasion by compassion and guilt. I will have marvelled, awed by nature and its life.
I love life (I love YOU)
It will all be, be done soon now. One more sublime waste in all its grandeur. A nothing requiem will lay testament to a nothing life. I, one more unknown will rise and fall in anonymity.

"event","Last night was fun. There was a benefit for Todd to benefit his widow, son and the house he was building for them when he died a month ago. It started at Amigos and then continued at Bubba Sulky Lounge (one of the sketchiest bars in town I have ever been in) I met Missy and Megs @ Amigos and only caught Tony Mcnobie's set. I had never seen his newer band, and they were real good. It surprised me that it was nothing like Rustic Overtones. Much more R+B type music. I was impressed. So we headed to Bubba's after that. Hellwheel drive was playing when we got there. BOOOOOOO that band is the most monotonous band I have ever heard in my life. Long songs, and they all drone on and sound the same. Someone else played after them that I didn't really pay attention to, I was to busy getting drunk to notice. Twisted Roots came on after that. I realize everytime I see these guys how much I have always really enjoyed them. They played alot of older songs which was awesome. They also played ""stronger then the flesh"" in Todd's memory which is reall cool because they never play that anymore and it is such a good song. I had them playing songs I wanted at the end of their the set which rules. All in all Toddapalooza was a good time.

I feel so helpless lately. My friends come to me for advice or to talk, and all I try to do is help but most of the time end up feeling like I have done nothing but make matters worst. I have so much on my mind lately, so many of my own problems that I can't do anything about. It's just so hard to try and help the people you I care about, and then try and work my own shit out. While feeling like all I have done is upset the person more by trying to be honest. It suck to hear someone you care about crying because of something you said even though it was something that someone else did. Which makes me think would it have been better to have just not said anything at all?
All I can do is try.............
I am hoping very much that thursday works out."

"event","that was what I woke up to today. It took me a minute to figure out who Shawn was talking about, but lets face it.... no conversation that starts out like that is bound to be good. Todd died yesterday morning from an asthma attack. WTF!!?? ASTHMA ATTACK????
Todd was one of the nicest, most down to earth guys I have ever met in my life. He was one of those people that would go out of his way to help anyone. Didn't matter who, or what is was he was there to help. He was the first to try and make you laugh if he thought you were down. Just an all around great guy. I keep thinking back to Halloween a couple of years ago. He showed up at Amigos in this all white skintight outfit (Todd is black), with a tight white small baseball cap on. carrying a small lantern. Nobody could figure out WHAT he was supposed to be. After hours of people guessing he finally just posed with the lantern held out in front of him and said ""I am a lawn jockey"". It was perfect because when he posed that way that was exactly what he looked like. We were all laughing so hard EVERYONE in the bar was crying, Todd included.
He was a great guy, a good husband, a great friend to many, and a great father. He will dearly be missed by all of us."

Another Saturday night
And I'm hangin once again
on my private little corner of hell
Little Mikey C. Just O.D'd
In the alley just a block away
Him and my little brother used to play
I watched the ambulance take him away
His mom's gonna take it hard
cause his dad just got locked away 
for 3 ta 5
For a deal he felt he had to make
for his family to survive

I know the world can be so cold
I know the world is so cold

Hangin' on the corner 
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to do 
And I got nothing to lose
Hangin, hangin' on the corner
Wasting away.
Another wasted night
Another bottle of booze, Alright!

And I know that no one cares:
I can see it in your empty stares
when I tell you these tales of woe
I tell you these tales of woe
because we really care.

I know the world can be so cold
I know the world is so cold

Down past Hayes Square
is where the wealthy dine
where they laugh and drink fine wine
Well, two blocks over
is where the Sergeant died
in a hall of fire 
on a warm summer's night
All you forgotten in the projects
I hear Ya'.
All you numbers in the cell block:
We care.
All you sweatin' in the detox:
We care.
To all you hoods that are dodgin' cops:
We care.
And to all you bleeding
from a broken heart
You know you've got a brother here.

Hangin' on the corner 
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to do 
And I got nothing to lose
Hangin, hangin' on the corner
Wasting away.
Another wasted night
Another bottle of booze, Alright!

Hangin' in the corner.
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to lose and I got nothing
ro prove to you.
Hangin', hangin on the corner, wasting away.
I pray my luck will change one day.
Some day."

"event","Falling down on this new day.
Watching time pass by.
As blackened shadows fall
beneath your eyes.
Nothing ever changes.
Things just stay the same.
Closing your eyes you wish for a whole new day
There's a movement
and it comes from within.
To make a real man stand up strong.
On the rebound from reality.
He has no friends to break his fall.
Conviction of a new day.
Brings a new found truth.
The truth he's never lived before.
Mentality of a madman. He spins a web.
And he'll always be caught in time.
Days go by.
And you wonder who to be.
To be the same old kid.
Or to turn another page.
Reckless wonderment.
As you drop down to your knees.
Think about your life and how it's been thrown away.

because your presence still lingers here
and it won't leave me alone

this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase

when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears

Postmark my Compass

I am bleeding through
Writing songs for you
If I could say what I felt
Then I would draw for you
I'm just a boy letting go of his heart
Because the days are like knives
And the knives are so sharp
One more kiss - so I don't forget
And then I'll open my arms
To embrace the regret
Fragile dreams - fistfight kings
Slowdance queens...
Oh pick me please
Sending ""get well"" cards to former stars
'Cause I know how it feels
To have fallen so far
Talentless yet nothingless
Than hopelessly in awe of you
I want nostalgia forever
If we throw this life away
Will we ever have to live again?
Say ""no"" and I'm all yours
Say ""yes"" and I'll still pull
Tell the boys I'll see them soon
Your lips were the softest yet
North, east, south and west...
I gave you my very best
I left my heart in yesterday
(Remember how it used to be)
I shot myself full of memory
(Before the world turned on me?)
Forget what you know
Forget that it hurts
The ""new days"" are coming...
They're getting worse
I am bleeding through
Writing songs for you
They're all for you"

Whatever this becomes
Whatever words I say
We are the fortunate ones...
And when the days are done
I won't forget
All I see in you and me
Is a light in the dark of humanity
And when the days are done
I won't forget
Timid steps - come walk with me, yeah
And with your useless words
Come talk to me
There are broken hearts
Now on your stereo
But the broken beats are just too slow
You'll cry - it doesn't change a thing
Kill the lights - and let the rain fall
Recall - the memories
Of yesterdays and better ways
And know - the innocence is gone...
Move on - from this day on
We'll never be the same...
The saddest songs
Make sense to me... yeah
So with your sunken eyes
Come talk to me
Two hour drives
Are two hours alone
But two hour drives
Are better than home
You'll die - it doesn't change a thing
YOU WILL - kill the lights
And let the rain fall - recall
The memories of yesterdays
And better ways
And know - the innocence is gone...
Move on - from this day on
We'll never be the same...
Faster words - and faster kids
Faster songs - and faster ends
The one thing that's stayed the same...
I've lived through days
I've lived through nights
I've had my loves
I've had my fights
You gotta know - you have my heart"

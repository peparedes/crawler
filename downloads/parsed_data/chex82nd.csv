I thought he was shipped out.."" well, dont worry. my date is november 12th, no sooner, no later. then i come back! yes, i wont get to go to the middle east :(  but, at least i get to go to college. 

 so, let me give you some info on whats been going on lately. nothing. well, ok... im working about 30 to 35 hours a week at a restaurant. im making about 80 to 100 dollars a night, just in tips. :) yeah, im happy!

 me and sarah, well.. NO ITS NOT BAD! she's just out of town, but we've been writting to each other, and she send me a picture of her. she looks really preetty. specially since i miss her alot. but i've also been visiting her family. just to say hi, and to get in touch with sarah too. i dont know whats going to happen when she comes back, considering that i'll be gone by then. but im hoping for the best. oh, i gotta go. take care people, and i'll see if i'll writte again soon. semper fi! peace."

"event","nah, just kidding. but i trully cant sleep. otherwise, i sure as hell wouldnt be updating at 545 in the fucking a.m. yargh. so here i am, listening to techno. thinking about how much god hates me. and the more he hates me, the more im willing to make HIS life hell. confused? give it some time, you'll get it. anyhow, so there's this girl at work who would like to hang out with me. obviously, i would love to hang out with her too, but i wasted just about every opportunity, by thinking wether i should, or shouldnt because of sarah. finnally, when i sorted everything else out she has to leave to go to UGA. tomorrow,  or should i say, today is her last day at work. i think she's moving in on thursday. if thats true, then i guess i'll have one and only one chance to hang out with her. if her CLASSES START on thursday, then i guess im S.O.L. boy do i feel dumb. i wish for another chance, thats for sure. anyhow, so once again, here i am listening to techno and trying to catch a sunrise, but i got a feeling the sun wont come up for another hour or two. poo. 

in other news, im up to 102 cd's. im quite proud of my accomplishment. and alot of people think that i probably dont listen to half of them, but they're wrong, by the end of the night, or the week.. which ever, my cd case will be empty and there would be a huge tower of cds just sitting right there next to the computer. did i mention im trying to catch a sunrise, but the sun wont come for another few hours, poo? maybe i should go for a run. but then again, by the time im back, there's probably school buses all over the place and little kids hanging about on the corners.. i sure dont want to be arround to witness that. WAY TOO MANY flashbacks. oh yeah, im supposed to hang out with my dad today. not my step dad, my real dad. yeah, he's in town. this ought to be interesting. here i'll be with my dad, who i really dont like talking to 'cause he really doesnt make things easy for me. and i'll be half asleep (a.k.a. royally pissed or cranky) and probably very fucking hungry. HEY! there's the first curse word in this whole entry. i have to admit, i've improved. i dont curse as much. OH, FUCK IT ALL TO HELL! he he he, sorry, had to do that. yup, so here i go, into another day. take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

"event","i went to lake lanier today, or should i say yesterday. i was supposed to be working that afternoon, but the manager told me to take a day off and i could work a double shift if i want. i dont think i'll be working a double shift tomorrow, no way in hell. anynow, so at the lake we were in the process of leaving, and there were 4 of us and 1 jet ski that can hold 3. so i said, i'll stay back, and then eric could come back and pick me up. well, while he was dropping mamma and pappa off ( those are classified names we've given to this couple that was with us) i made a mansion out of stone. sarah would have loved it. i know i did. so, it took me a while to build that damn thing, 'cause the water kept seeping in the whole i dug.  (that was the base of the house)but after a while, i got it up.. at first i had a wall of mud going, but that didnt last too long, so i added a front ""shield"" of flat stones to block the H2O. so, once i got the main frame of the house, i added some mud to the top of the house and made a second story. this was too, out of flat stones. then, i made a deeper, but smaller hole and filled it with water, which oddly enough, it was a difficult task to accomplish. but, i filled it up and added a diving board out of a used condom i found. just kidding, i made if of a stick i found. so, i flattened the sand around it and all that stuff, and my multi-million dollar mansion was build and ready to be used.if i were to be given a little bit more time, i could have build a whole metropolis. its name could have been.... metropolis! acutally, metropoliz.. with a ""z"" just cause i feel like it. anyhow, so that was my highlight. a multi-million dollar mansion by the lake that me and sarah are going to move into.. LOL, or so i wish. yeah.. so thats pretty much what i did, sit back, relax and just take the day as it comes. just what the doctor suggested; even though, i dont really see a doc. or anything. 

anywho, so then i went to see lilo and stich for the 6th time. i really like that movie. and now im here. well, i hate to do this, but i really must get going to bed. i gotta work tomorrow, hopefully. take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

"event","on sunday i get my own tables, that way i get to keep all the tips. you know its funny how you pick up on habits of someone or something you think about alot. i found myself eating before 6 week. i've also been exerciseing alot this week. althouh.. i know i could do more, its just i come home so tired from work. i just thought that was an interesting observation, yes, im amused easily.

 i like my work. they think i have the potential to become their best server (aka waiter) and if all goes well, i could probably be their employee of the month. not really, but they did say i have the potential. it was funny, 'cause i cracked up when randy, my manager said that. so he asked me why i was laughing and i told him that he reminded me of yoda when he said that. i dont know how or why, but he did. so now, im the crack head of the restaurant. anyhow, here are some lyrics again.. and i'll head out now.. take care everyone, semper fi. peace.


I'm still here..under the moon. 
I was just a child but you seemed like so much more. 
The way you would approach me and drift across the floor, 
I'd see you in the hall and you'd kiss me with a smile. 
I never understood it was I even worth your while? 
The other kids at school they would hate me and they'd spit. 
Cuz I was just a no one to them I wasn't shit. 
But you would always hold me and stand there by my side, 
We were only 17 we'd be together till we died. 
But then it all happened the ever dreadful day. 
Somebody tried to rape you and now I'll make him pay. 
You pointed him out to me my thoughts began to race. 
I took my daddy's 45 and shot him in the fuckin' face! 
I did it all for you and though I'm facin' years 
I would do the time just to equal all your tears 
The last thing that you told me when I left the courtroom 
Is that we'd always be together... cuz we're both under the moon. 

""I'll forever love you even in your doom, we'll always be together cuz 
we're both under the moon"" 

I sit here in my cell and the walls are made of stone 
I justified your pain but now I sit alone 
I write another letter I write one everyday 
I never got a letter back I write em anyway 
I try to call collect your number has been changed 
I'm starin at the light bulb and I start to feel deranged 
You never came to visit me I sit facin the glass 
No one's on the other side and now its in the past 
My head is always spinnin I'm poundin' on the wall 
I feel like I'm forgotten no sign of you at all 
You're probably gettin' married you're probably gettin fucked 
I'll break out of this cage and try to cut that mu thefucka up 
I curl up in the corner my body will corrode, 
My teeth are turning into dust my skin is growing mold 
I'm starin' out the window of my eternal doom 
I know that you are out there... somewhere underneath the moon. 

""i'll forever love you even in your doom we'll always be together cuz 
we're both under the moon"" 

Many many years many more to go does she still remember? God he only knows I 
now become a savage they chain me to a wall I still can see your body I 
still can hear your call I'm nothin but a maggot I'm locked away and lost the 
world that doesn't want me my dignity is tossed and to the girl for who I feel this doom look here...fuck you and the moon! 

""i'll forever love you even in your doom we'll always be together cuz 
we're both under the moon""

 i really dont have a whole lot to write about, right now im just trying to figure some stuff out. so throughly confused. actually, its not really confusion, because i really do know what i should do, its jut the fact that i dont know if i should or shouldnt, or how i should do it. do what you ask? well, i hate to do this to y'all, but i cant tell. its not like a super confidential G-14 classefied thing, but its better not to talk about it just yet. specially since there might be people who know about it already. anyhow, the point it, i really do know what to do, its just, i might be risking a whole lot of stuff. key word: might... either way, i think theres a risk, on ALL sides. but most of all, im really afraid. afraid of what? well, afraid of the risks, im afraid of failure, im afraid of pretty much everything. not only that but in an odd sort of way, i feel intimidated, though i shouldnt be. anyhow, hopefully, i'll figure it out soon. sometime  before the end of july.. actually, that might be alot to ask for. anywho.. i'll update on this later on in life. im off for now, take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

 ok, so friday i was bored out of my mind. i had been watching stand up comedy the whole night untill it ended at 11. hmmm.. stand up comedy... *ahem* anyhow, about 1101 my boredom kicked in even more. so i decided to play on my puter for a bit. at like 1120 or so, i get a call from mike. he wanted to go to a club. so i said, sure, let me get dressed up. or, dressed for that matter. (no i wasnt nekked, i was just in boxers.. that is also un-necessary info) mike and his girl got to my house at midnight, and from there we headed downtown. anyhow, so we ended up at buckhead at 2 in the morning, cause nothing good was happening downtown. from 2 till 5 we were dancing and hitting on drunk 26 yearolds. by the time i got home it was about 6 or so. at nine in the FUCKIN* ( i had to cencore it somehow :)  ) morning, my mom wakes me up, bunch of boring crap happened afterwards (much of which i dont remember because i was still semi-unconsious) anyhow, saturday.. me and johnson headed to the office (marines office) to do some paper work. i took a big sheet of mini-marine corps stickers. then, we headed over kats place, where we stuck them all over the her house. it was fun. well, i enjoyed annoyihng the crap out of her. i dont think i've ever heard the word ""no"" comming out of a girls mouth, so many times in one day. anyhow, then i went over to kyles bbq. and that was about it. 

  and the qote~o~day

me: hi we're repersentatives from the united states marine corps, and we came here to  reprocess your house. 
kyle: uh, its repocess.
  kat just shakes her head and walks back in the house.. or so she tries, because she locked herself out and her mom wouldnt open the door. that was actually pretty damn funny. 

anyhow, i think im going to go now, cause im bored.. yet  again. take care everyone, semper fi. peace.

  i really dont know what to write about. im still kinda overwhelmed at the fact that this is my last year in high school... it all went by so fucking fast. and each time i think about it, i regret more and more each time i had stupid arguements, and felt angry at johnson. why am i putting so much enphasis on johnson? well, lets put it this way, we've been best friends for the past 4 years. we've gone through countless situations, such as break ups, bad school times, and who could ever forget the flame thrower incident, AND the cheeze cake incident. my step brother tells me that saying good bye to friends, is part of growing up, but,` what the hell is the point of making such a brother hood, if youre just going to say good bye.  i say, fuck growing up, cause i aint saying good bye. unless, one of us gets killed in combat. but theres not much of an option there. the point is, im going to miss the little fucker, he's the brother i never had. damn it,this song makes me think too much about life. *rar*

  ok, so friday.. what happpened friday..Oh yeah, we had field day on friday, which was ok i guess. i remember skiping home room last year, so i could go to the field day, and it was awsome. they had a big ol' bouncy thing from the marine corps, and a hell of alot of food and and, live music. this year, well.. lets just say that the field was quite empty. the only good thing out of it was, that me, johnson and a few other friends got to play full contact ultimat frizbee. it was tight, kyle almost died of a freeeken concussion. and i got a tan, or a burn, uh.. lets just say its a little bit of both. 

 later on that day, me and johnson tried to leave early from field day to catch star wars, but they were checking for checkout slips out in the parking lot. so we had to turn around and go back in. after school was over, i went home, slept for like an hour or two and then mowed the freeken lawn. which actually didnt take me too long. we tried to catch star wars again at like 8 or 9, but they were all sold out still, until 1045. me and kyle just said ""fuck that"", and left. came home, watched some stand up comedy( which i absolutely love) and fell asleep on the sofa. 

 saturday was kinda dull. woke early as fuck to look for jobs, then afterwards, me and a few friends attempted to make a movie for german class (its 50% of my final) and then.. i ont remember what else i did last night. i wanted  to go out really bad, i was all dress up last night, but no one was around. so that really pissed me off. i almost went driving around like i usually do, but i need the gas right now. and thats about it. nothing went on today, we finished the movie... which is really messed up. thats all i got to say about it. and came home, did my room.. blah, blah, blah, yakety-smakety. so now, you know the rest of the story. anyhow, i think im going to to now cause my time is up. give me a few days to reply emails and all that junk. dont bother calling me on my cell, cause thats messed up and i gotta get it fixed, it'll be about two weeks untill i can use it again. take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

  hey kat. we need to talk. seriously... actually, NO, we dont. i dont trust you that much. LOL.  but seriously, give me a call at my house sometime, 
(i dont have my cell on me right now) anyhow, i gotta go now. take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

 its been interesting week so far. not a whole lot has been done, but its just weird. and then today, the freekiest thing happened to me. i started jerking off in the car and a cop pulled me over.. JUST KIDDING!!!! DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN! ha ha ha! *ahem* yeah, anyway.. so i poped an old cd in my car, on the way to school. well, since it was cold outside and there was a song i used to listen alot, a WHOLE lot of memories started rushing through. i mean, flash-back is an understatement. so bad, that i almost didnt drive to school. i realized that i was going the wrong way.. im like.. wtf am i doing? but, i got to school just fine and dandy. *COUGH, COUGH... HACK! WHEEZE* excuse me. damn, i think a chunk of my lung just flew out of my mouth. anyhow, i think i'll head out now. take care everyone, SEMPER FI!! peace."

"event","damn i hate beeing sick. sorry, for what i said earlier on... im just REALLY not feeling well. not only that im getting sick of hearing people complain over stuff that they shouldnt complain about. for example, lonelieness; when they're seeing 2 or 3 people at the same time. Depression; when they are doing drugs or alcohol. I cant stand the fact that some people have it easy and they dont even realize it. hell, i know i could have it easy, if i just would get my act together, then possibly i wouldnt be in the situation i am right now. there's only a few people that know about it, those are the people who i trust the most. now that i realize it, its not that big of a deal, but im still disapointed. anyhow...

 you know, if i had another chance to re-do high school, i really dont think i would change a thing. well, ok.. maybe i'd actually do my homework. but other than that, im glad that what happened happened. i' learning from my and others mistakes. im learning slowly, but non the less, im doing something about it. anyhow, i gotta feeling that things will hopefully change in the next few months. some for good, and some for bad. all i know is that i dont have much time left to fix what i've got to fix. im pretty sure it'll all work out. i think its just a matter of time. anyhow, im going to head out now, cause i feel very sick right now. take care everyone, semper fi. peace."

 yeah, so today i helped my brother build the deck. i was there from noon to six. we had fun i guess, alot of brotherly jokes. *but what i liked best is that he actually listened and responded to some of my ideas/input that i was giving out. it really made me feel good. hell, im kinda used to hearing.. "" why do that?"" or "" shut up, its dumb"" or something like that coming from people. but oh well*~ BACK TO THE STORY ~ SO, i called shelly ( his wife) big mamma, since she's going to have a baby (not till december), y'all know me.. i give out nicknames.. its my sence of humor. well, she didnt quite like it. i guess girls or ladies dont like being called big even if they're pregnant. *lesson lerned* lol, irony, learned.. lernd.. oh boy.. i crack myself up. anyhow, im going to go and bug the hell out of my sister. take care everyone.

  anyhow, i dont think that i'll be going to music midtown.. as much as i love mistikal and all.. i've just been getting stoned too much at the festival. it really started to bother me today too.. like, i actually felt sick, kinda like, back in the day when i was a big stoner.

  today, was fucking awsome though, a little too cold and a little wet, but other than that, it was just what i needed. frist, me and johnson end up dressing up almost exacly alike.. all by accident though.. anyhow, we got there saw a couple of bands, but the party got started when we cought bubba sparxxx on stage. Now.. i kinda dont like him, but since it was him and jim crow on the same set, it was fucking awsome, then.. uh, then we saw another band, but i dont rember what it was, because i wasnt paying attention. ( the chick in front of me had a very cute thong on..=D ) anyhow, and last but not least, counting crows. one of my favorite bands, and they played so good... it was incredibble.. OH YAH! the name of that other band as O.A.R. they were ok, but.. eh.. i wasnt in the mood for it. after counting crows we left. 

 after all that, i was tired and hungry and just ugh.. so we decided to stop by wa-ho. i've got to say, this wa-ho is the best one, its clean, the cervices is not only good, but its also fast, AND the food is actually tasty. anyhow, so we ate in 7 mins (marine corps style =D) and headed over to catch spider man, which btw, is an AWSOME movie. i want to see it again, cause there were these stupid little  girls that just wouldnt shut the hell up.

 ""man, why is it that my wortse memories have to revolve around katherine, the wa-ho fiasco after the football game, the starbucks coffee scandal, and finnally the FUCKING cheese cake incident.. oy...""

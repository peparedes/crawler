"event","I started working for my grandpa yesterday. I'm so excited!!!! Appliance Repair Technician here I come!!!
We're supposed to go dancing tonight. Don't think I want to go. *yawn*
I might just tell Frank to go without me *lol* Maybe I'll stay home, have a drink, take a bath and watch a movie. Then go party like a rockstar. Probably not but sounded good :)
I changed my name by the way. If anyone is interested in knowing what it is, send me an email. If I know you, I'll tell you. If I don't, don't ask.
The reason was....basically to get away from certain people."

<p align=""center""><b><font size=""4"" face=""Bradley Hand ITC"" color=""#9900CC"">Starting today I'm taking over my own life. Not that anyone's been doing it for me, but there's so much going on that I feel like I have no control over. I want to go back to school, I want to go to the gym, I want to have a part time job so I have time to get my things done. By the way....not sure who else reads this but I got fired from my job. That was a kick in the teeth. Didn't have enough experience. Anyway, I wouldn't of been able to go to school with that job anyway. Such is life.<br>
I want to get married someday. Let's be honest, I want to marry my boyfriend someday. I have thousands of dollars in bills I can't pay and I feel that my only option is to file bankruptcy. I don't want to do that. No one
wants to marry someone that is so much in debt, and no one wants to marry someone that has a bankruptcy. I just don't know what direction I'm going to go in. Either way, I've got a list a mile long of things that I need to get done and I'm going to just do them...no putting anything off anymore. I'm doing it for me, for my girls and for my boyfriend. I love him so much. So, I'll be keeping up on here of what I've been able to get done, what I want to do and anything else I can think of.</font></b><br>

"event","<P align=""center""><font face=""High Tower Text"" size=""5"" color=""#CC0099"">I've been thinking about changing my name. Yes, I'm thinking of jumping on the band wagon. The first time I ever thought about it, I was 15 years old and I liked the name Khorin. (korin). I've recently been partial to Madyson, Maddisen, or Maddison. I've never been into the tradition spelling of names. That's probably why both of my girls have somewhat different spellings of ""Rebecca"" and ""Rachel"".&nbsp;<br>
My friend Nate decided to tell me if I ever changed my name he would just call me Bill.</font></P>"

"event","<P align=""center""><font face=""High Tower Text"" size=""5"" color=""#CC0099"">I haven't been on ski's since I was 15 years old. That's almost 10 years!! I'm so excited yet a little scared, since the reason I haven't gone up, is that I had knee surgery when I was 21. BUT, I've never been one to let anything like that stop me. Frank bought a new snowboard, and he's gonna be doing that for the day. I'm sure I won't get off the bunny hill. I rented ski's from GI Joes last night. They were only $16, compared to $25 on the mountain. I got some really nice ski pants, gloves, goggles, and I think I'm all set. I have a really nice camara case that attatches to my pants, so I'll be taking lots of pictures up there. We also had to buy chains last night at costco. They weren't very expensive though! Anyway, Frank made me coffee this morning, and when he brought it in, he said ""Marsha, best girlfriend in the world, wake uppppppp"" He's so cute. And he's all mine *lol*<br>
OMG, then last night he was working on his snowboard, and I came out to the living room to luv on him for a while and he said ""I love your smile sooooo much....I want a wife that smiles like that"" lol then I said ""ok good, you will!"" :D<br>
Anyway, we're headed out now. byeeee ~MJ~</font></P>"

"event","<P align=""center""><font face=""High Tower Text"" size=""5"" color=""#CC0099"">Last night, while we were getting into bed, I asked Frank ""hey babe, can I ask you a serious question?"" He said yes, of course. I said ""do you think you would really be happy with me being the last girl you ever sleep with?"" He was funny for a second, and said ""yeah...you're pretty good in bed"" ~lol~ Then he said, ""yes of course"". We've talked a little about our future, and what it might have in store for us. Sometimes a little serious, sometimes not. This morning I ran in the room and jumped on him, trying to wake him up. He kept saying I was cute. Then ""I want a girlfriend that's cute all the time.. ""I want a wife that's cute all the time"".... Sometimes he says things like that. It makes me know that we're still on the same page with everything else that's going on in our lives.<br>
I'm so in love with him. We used to argue. I used to walk around with a chip on my shoulder every day...most days were good...but a lot were just ok. Our days aren't just ok anymore. They are wonderful, and I'm so excited to know that the man I'm with is the one I want to be with for the rest of my life.</font></P>"

We went shopping this afternoon, and we got some $89.99 sheets! We looked as some 800 thread count ones, but didn't like them as much as the 350 thread count ones.<br>

Im fucking alone here.
I thought I had a real friend (offline) and she fucking stabs me in the back saying she doesnt GET how I can want to be here for my husband all the time. HE IS MY HUSBAND!!! OF COURSE IM GOING TO BE HERE FOR HIM. AND I DONT JUST DO NOTHING! IM DOING COLLEGE CLASSES AND TRYING TO GET A NEW PLACE!!! FUCK YOU.
Im so tired of being kicked when Im down... it hurts so badly...
And I DONT GET IT. Im a good person, I really really really am.
So many people hate me or say shit to me like that. Almost all of Brandon's friends are that way- they hate me with such a passion that I just cant help but always lose. His parent's hate me because Im shy and I get so scared. My best friend now talks shit about me it seems.
My parent's are getting a divorce because my dad is a dick. And he was my HERO. THANKS FOR THE STAB IN THE BACK. Self centered ego driven SP!!!!! And my poor mom. Im so fucking scared for her... I can hear every bit of pain, I know she is a lot like me, and when she loves- she loves for all of time. I wouldnt be able to go through what she is... I CANT TAKE THIS WITH MY PARENTS. I have no where to escape to- Its all just crap!!!! I mean, I dont even get a christmas now. Brandon said a while ago that I could go spend it with his family if I needed to... but its still the same. Ive never been Alone for christmas...... My parents, it scares me more then I can say. Its getting to my head, I get worried about being hurt. I dont want to become my mom. I want to be with Brandon for the rest of my life and more. And that only makes me fuck up more because then I get jealous easily.
And FUCK ME.
Im on the patch now- to regulate my monthly- and OMFG. I got my first Period with it, and FUCK ITS THE WORST PMSING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! PMSing is NO exscuse to ever be a bitch- but I had told Brandon I might be moody- and I would do my best... but I STILL fucked up. I got jealous because he talked to some... girls that hate me, and I told him I didnt see why he did- and he...... doesnt even want to talk to me now! He could die, I could die over here even- and he doesnt want to talk to me because IM STUPID. The little things DONT MATTER. They are silly and people dont realize how fucking lucky they are to just be with the most amazing person ever- the person who loves them, the person who you love. Its worth more then the little stupid things. AND HE WAS BEING SO ROMANTIC AND SWEET BEFORE I GOT PISSY OVER SUCH A STUPID THING. And I just had to be stupid. God I would do ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD TO HAVE A REWIND BUTTON. Just once. Just one single one.
...I wonder if my Mom wants one....
Am I a bad person?
Im alone here, Im alone back at my parent's, I have no one exept my Brandon- and he wont even talk to me right now because Im a bitch.


I would do anything to just wake up in the morning to hear my love's voice say I love you- and hear my parents wish me good holidays with cozy traditions I cling to with all my life- to feel my heart skip a beat in a good way.


WHY DOES LIFE ALWAYS HAVE TO CHANGE SO DRASTICALLY?

stfu. yes I cant spell. but Im emotional so I dont give.


FUCKING PMSING."

Isn't that just funny?
         
But...its like a whole lot of hours I have to take, and a bunch of shit- like 2 Govt. classes! Even if I just want to teach 2nd graders (which I don't) I would have to take Govt. Which makes me go... ""Then why in the hell are all those teachers we had in school so... well stupid when it came to stuff other then what they taught""?! Ong.
But I don't know what else to do. Marine Biology seems out of the question... even though I would do anything to be able to swim with Sharks in an Aquarium as a job D:. Oh well. Plus I learned through reasearch that it might not be a good job to have, because not everywhere has an the sea or an Aquarium.... And no classes are available for it online, that I know of. So yeah, that sucks.

At this point, I dont care. I just want to go to college and get a career. PLUS no matter what I choose, I can still be a Tattoo artist. Maybe I should work on both. OR... maybe I should take a degree in something that would help me create my own tattoo shop one day xD

Teacher.... wow. It would be fun, and I would always have summer off. And I can go ANYWHERE I want as a Teacher.

It makes me happy to be setting up for it though :D And I know Brandon is proud of me!!!

I miss him so much, you would never know unless you had been through this. Its a miss that no words could speak for. But talking to him like I do helps SO much. I love him to no end :D And I love making him proud- it makes me feel like I am AMAZING and nothing could ever beat me. HEYAY! :D

Ok. I have a headache. And Killer wants to sleep, he has been meowing at me to for the past 2 hours, poor kitten."

Brandon said I can get this BAD ASS laptop that the screen turns and folds, AND THE SCREEN TURNS INTO A TABLET!!!!!!!!!! So I could draw right on the damn screen!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT. We have to buy stuff in SA though xD Because we will be gone so we can't order anything here. BUT we thought we were getting the bonus in SA anyways, so we had already planned to make room to bring stuff back.

I plan on meeting up with a lot of people I used to hang out with, like Steph and Pat and Kelli and even Kim. Woah lol. If anyone else wants to hang out lemme know :3

I am going to spend as much time as possible with Brandon still though, due to the fact that he leaves for overseas soon, every moment I get is a blessing.

I can't wait to play the Wii with my bros though! THEY ARE GOING TO FREAK. I got the new Wario Ware Inc game just so I can play it with them, and let me tell you- BEST DRINKING GAME EVER.

My friend wanted to go shopping this morning so I could get more paint for the room, and she was all ""lets go a 8:30am!"" so I woke up majorly ealier then usual.

SO MY MORNING SUCKED BECAUSE-
I wake up, and its pouring rain out, but I mopped all the floors last night so I wanted to make sure the dog would pee outside, so I throw on clothes REAL fast, pull on my boots, and take her out back.
THE DOOR LOCKED BEHIND ME.
The stupid nob locked for who knows why, so even though I had my keys, I couldn't get in the back door, and the front door had the stupid chain lock on. SO I am standing outside in the pouring rain with my dog!!!!!
So I put the dog where its not raining, and I WALK all the way to the housing center IN THE RAIN. I get there, soaking wet, and they are just like ""OK! Lets go!"" And we get here and the guy had  a fucking key! So he just opens the back door for me, and whoosh, I was inside! And it only took an hour of being totally soaking wet.

Then all day long things kept messing up for me. I was going to buy Brandon <b>God of War II</b> (I WANT IT!!!) because they actually had one at the mall, BUT then when I go to use the Debit card, for some reason I was SOOOO tired, and the person checking me out would NOT shut up, that I kept putting in the wrong pin number, AND I GOT LOCKED OUT OF MY DEBIT CARD!
So no game.

But like half an hour later I got upset because I needed to buy milk and the like, so I just called the bank and they unlocked it for me. No game though, I was already gone.

Then Destiny had to go to every single freaking store that carried sheets, pillows, and bed spreads, compair them all, and then go back again. Its ok, it was fun, it was just soooo much walking.

BUT
I got some really awesome shit.
I got a HUUUUGE dish set thats REALLY nice for only $10!
I found my book I have been looking for for the past week and a half and bought that.
Three AWESOME shirts and some nice jeans from Kohl's <3
I got to eat fast food again <333 Yum, I miss the stuff.
And I got the rest of the paint for Brandon's wall! :D (as well as some food, but thats usual)

AND the day went by SOOOO fast, SO NOW I AM ONE DAY CLOSER TO BRANDON BEING HOME! >:D YES!!!!

Now, I sleep, because I am so fucking tired."

Got paid today right, but then I had to spend the WHOLE DAMN PAYCHECK on the stupid airplane tickets so that Brandon and I can go visit SA next month. I was hoping on ordering some pizza for once D: I Loooooove pizza.

Yeah, so I am in the room I am working on, sitting on the floor, because I want good music while I work, and I need a good reference to make sure I am not fucking it up.

My friend Ben says I should paint walls with special designs for a living. I wonder if it would really be good money :3 Would you hire someone to paint something cool like this on your wall for just a little over the cost of paint? :D"

And my day was totally awesome.
I woke up real late. Then I got to go hang out with Destiny and Christina (from Romania!) and we just had a fucking blast. I bought the rest of the paint, so tomorrow I can start painting Dark side of the Moon on Brandon's wall!! And we all just hung out and went all over downtown shopping and shit. We got back and ate, then we all went over to Destiny's house and watched a bunch of girlie movies that made us all miss our husbands. Then Brandon called and I was so happy! :D

It consisted of a lot of things but the best parts were-

+ A nerd who fainted at the right times
+ An EVIL queen

The best part was when I caught the evil witch and got her in a blanket (she transformed into something small?) and I beat her over and over against a mirror till.. well I won, and she lost her life. (Remember, fairy tale, come on.) LMFAO it was awesome.

Today was actually so far a pretty good day, as far as my days have gone since Brandon left for training.

I'm officially determined to do as much as I can to get really good things done here before he gets back. Like training the damn dog lol, maybe getting a kitten as his long overdue gift, maybe painting some room in the house (like the living room or the room thats going to be full of my stuff), maybe (IF I can) totally setting up a theme in his room as a suprise (like, buying more posters he collects, painting the walls, putting a pink Floyd Dark side of the Moon Logo on the wall w/ paint, setting up his guitar stuff, so on), actually making the outside of our house look like its lived in, and maybe setting up a small fenced area in the backyard for the dog or something. Who knows, but I would LOVE to be able to work on something awesome :] Only thing is money, which suddenly has gotten into a LITTLE bit of a rougher spot seeing as suddenly I have to pay MY parents $600 and HIS parents $200 TOMORROW. That leaves me with a little less then $200 till the 15th, and I need to go shopping for food. Its not to bad though :D I still might be able to paint something before the 15th. Or at least plan out a room totally so that I can rush it in 5 days XD LOL.

When I was there, my blood pressure bottomed out and I almost had some major problems, but they were awesome and took care of me in like 2 seconds. The main test was 30 minutes straight of the most intense pain I have ever felt in my entire life, but I did it, and thats all that matters.

I am still feeling it all though. Everytime I get up to walk just to like another chair or something I get really weak and shit, like I am about to faint, but I can do it. Its just a little rough only because I am here alone, so I HAVE to do everything for myself, like cook dinner (which I have no idea how I am going to do). But if I did all that, I can take care of myself here easily.

Moody aftermath much, yeah. I just want to hear from Brandon some, stupid training. Only (<i>Hopefully</i>) 17 days left till he gets back.

Money problem is outta the picture now though :D Which is so good its amazing. We now have more then plenty money in the bank, and more on the way later, so its all good in that area. Makes me feel a lot better about tomorrow.

Also, there is this contest going on on this site I am an active member of, and the prize is a brand new Black DS Lite. I already have a White DS Lite, which Brandon had oh so sweetly gotten me for my birthday (last August), BUT I am trying to win it for him :3 That would be such an awesome gift, because he could take it with him to Iraq when he leaves. The contest seems pretty easy for someone whos been on the site for a while like I have, so I just have to work at it some. No problem. Won't know who has won until the end of March though.

Only, she was beaten really really bad, so she runs away from EVERYONE and EVERYTHING exept me, whom she follows around EVERYWHERE. But with Brandon, who has NEVER hit her or yelled at her or even TRIED to upset her in any way, she fears like you have no idea! She won't get near him, and anytime he walks near me, she flips and runs away. o___o; But as soon as he is away from me she is right with me. I can't get her to accept him at all, and sometimes she is uber annoying, she will stand RIGHT at my feet and try to knock me over because she thinks its playing. Oh and potty training... anyone have any advice on training an abused dog? She is BADDDD. She won't even TRY to let you know she has to go, she just goes wherever she is standing. Earlier today I took her outside for an hour (I do that about every hour or so), and then we came back in and the first thing she did was go on my newly cleaned floor. Wtf. And if you yell at her she panics and flips out. (she is NOT dangerous though, not yet anyways.) I love her to death already, but she is a major pain in the ass. When we got her, at the house of the person who gave her to us, she was FIIINE, a little nervous, but fine. o_o; why?

ANYWAYS Ididn't mean for this to be so long. I just got carried away <3"

Its been 2 days since I have been able to even TOUCH the wii. No shitting.

The damn guy went to save my file for me (twas 3 nights ago) and saved over his own with mine, wtf. SO he had to sit there and replay the whole damn thing to get back to where he was. ONG HOLY FUCK does he HAVE to litterally stop and cut every single piece of grass on the way there? YES. Whoosh. I am going to go take it I swear. NOW. :3

Brandon has stolen my fucking Wii. HE ALWAYS DOES THIS.
Thats what happened when he fucking ""bought me ff12"". I NEVER GOT TO PLAY IT, NOT ONCE. Because the second we got home he got on and played it and played it and played it, and if I ever asked to I could only play for like 5 minutes before he would HAVE to get back on. ARGH.

SO now he is in there on MY damn Wii playing MY damn Zelda game, and he just KEEPS PLAYING. I WANT TO PLAY. ITS MINE. Wtf.
This is why when I lived at my parent's place, NO ONE could play any of my important games (Like Zelda or FF games) until I had already beaten them! BECAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE OVER. NOOOOO.

I don't mind sharing, but FUCK man. Not fair. I only got to play yesterday after he was asleep, and then I had to play without the sound.

D: I get a new Wii and already I am deprived. I just upset and bored as fuck, and its hard to watch him play.

For Valentines Day, Brandon TOTALLY BOUGHT ME A WII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
For a whole $425! O_O;

The Wii's(IF you actually ever find one in a store anywhere anymore) originally sell for $250. But I have been wanting one SOOOOOOOO bad, I have been stalking every single place that even mentions games for the past month trying to find one, but its a small freaking town, yeah right. But Tomorrow he is supposed to get his Army Bonus of like 7k and all. SO he went on E-bay and bought me one for $425! O...M...G I CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT! I am supposed to get it tomorrow!!!! I WANT IT NOW SO BAD XD XD XD I am seriously like... counting down the hours till tomorrow LOL!

Sad thing is though... Last year our Valentines day was a total BUST, he didn't want to do a single thing, so he didn't until I made him... which was bitchy of me. SO this year I had told him that all I really wanted was to be with him, to just spend the night being close to him and I would be happy. SO I DIDN'T GET HIM ANYTHING O_O; (Not like I have any money.... but... you know..) I don't know what to do lol. He says its ok, because really all the money I get is what he gives me (no job due to having a few strokes in the past month), which is true, but still D:.
Maybe I can draw him something REALLY quick x]

I'm totally going to get Zelda Twilight Princess! YES!!!!!!!!!!

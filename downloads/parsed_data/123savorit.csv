friday i rode zacharys bus home, and right when we arrived at zacharys, we walked to sheetz, around 7 we ventured off to richards for a rigirous night of halo with out trevor huey and nicholas anthony strayer, it seemed boring without fellow companion trevor, so we called up the ill friend, and with some tough convincing, he was allowed to come over with his ear inffecton, we played some intense halo, teams were zachary graham trevor and myself dueling against shane richard thomas and miniture richard, christopher dobbins. it was an over all draw, and finaly, according to ricky we did ""somthing cool"" but without his tripod, the next day we hiked back to zachs but not before zachs dental appointment after that we, oh how do you youngsters say ""hung out"" went to sheetz and the skateboarding park, where i tore dat shit up mother fucker, ::clearthroat:: i mean, i did a quite smashing job, considering it was my first time in oh six months, we returned to zachs where we met the arrival of zachs lovely lady friend and we traveled onto sheetz were we met up with companion richard amend the third. we treked back to zachs and made a delightful, naturally fat free food by the name of jell-o, we relaxed the night away, and made a flamethrower from our bodily gases using our rear ends, it was quite the time, this monring ricahrd left around noon and zachary and i enjoyed a relaxing day of doing absolutely nothing, excpet when we ate all of richards jell-o and his reddi whip, although i told him my self to purchase cool whip, we enjoyed some fairly odd parents where then i was taken home by father, robert john gonzalez.
i am right now eating delightful honey barbaque wings

Sincerly,
Nate

"event","I saw Spiderman 2 last night.....frikin' awesome. *beware of spoilers*. Dock Ock ""dies"". Harry finds his dads green goblin stuff. MJ finds out that peter parker is spiderman. So does Harry. They set up the possibility for a lot of villains in the next movie. The Lizard, Venom, and the Green Goblin (again). I didn't like this version of Dock Ock very much because the arms controlled him (they had A.I.). Plus he should've had the accent from the 1967 cartoon version. Welcome To Jim's Life."

Allison hung out with me like all day and it was one of the best b-day's ever. Our waiter at Outback was gay though. It was funny though. Today I went to Allison's after school and watched Jerry Springer. Work really sucked cuz the checks kept getting all messed up in the pocket. Now I'm home and talking to people online and watching Seinfeld. Tomorrow night Allison and I, and Chris and Liz are going to the drive in. It's gonna be a good time. Welcome to Jim's Life."

But me and pete talked about old cartoons on the way up and back and even though that was pointless it was still more fun. I had to order yet another tux for the Stars of Tomorrow ceremony, but that should be fun. Tomorrow is my birthday so make sure u say happy birthday or I will cry a tear for every person that doesn't.

Then I went and saw Troy with Allison. Everyone died who I DIDN'T want to die. But other than that it was a pretty good movie. Then we came back to my house and watched Big Fish and I loved that movie. Then as I was coming back from taking Allison home it started raining like crazy and I could barely see but because of my superior driving skills I made it home. Or maybe it was just luck, I don't know, I'll just say superior driving skills. And now I have to go to church soon. Welcome to Jim's Life."

Although, sometimes I feel like I'm listening to the same song. And I think they tried to be a little too poetic with the lyrics...BUT other than that I like it. I've barely worked at all this week and it's awesome. I got out of work early because of the concert. Then yesterday was a short night. And tonight I get to get out at 5:55 so I can be at the school by 6. Sweet deal. Tomorrow (friday) I'm gonna be at Houghton all day for orientation weekend. While there I will be scoring another laptop (for free), and printer (also for free). Also I'll prolly find out who my roommate is. I hope he's not annoying like me. Well I'm hungry and noone is online so I'm gonna grab some food. Welcome to Jim's Life."

"event","Well, since I'm really bored and will be for the rest of the day and I have nothing in my life to write about, I just thought I'd ramble on with useless advice to anyone who actually likes to read my Live Journal. My first advice is to never stop making an idiot out of yourself, but don't over do it. If you see a cat and it's hair is all straight and it's tail is poofy don't say ""aww look a cat"" and then try and pet it because that would be stupid. Don't kick yourself because you might pull a muscle. Sometimes you've just gotta pull down your pants and slide down the ice. Don't threaten someone bigger than you, unless your faster. If you're watching a crappy movie, turn it off, because you could be doing something else. Play video games, trust me you'll regret it if you don't. If you find yourself staring at a girl and she starts looking back, don't do any of the following...fart, sneeze, blow your nose, pick your nose, puke, or scratch yourself. Wear more than one shirt a day, but only one pair of socks (if any at all). Stand in the rain and enjoy it. Don't stand in the rain holding up a big metal pole or you're in for a shock. Don't watch ""The Fabulous Life of...."" on VH1 because it'll just make you jealous. Don't throw a ripe apple, it's a good thing so eat it. No matter how cool you think it is, it is NOT the best thing since sliced bread. Give M*A*S*H a chance. Do NOT listen to rap, it is senseless rabble about sex and alcohol. Watch cartoons or else you'll lose the grasp on your childhood for the rest of your life. If you're frustrated do NOT punch a hole in the wall, it'll prolly hurt. Don't waste your time reading some pointless live journal that is written by a guy who has too much time on his hands. And last but CERTAINLY not least never EVER ever follow my advice about important stuff. Good thing nothing I said was important. Welcome to Jim's Life."

"event","Without God, where would we be? If God ceased to be, the world would literally deteriorate. I thank God for his love and his everlasting mercy on me. I ask that those of you who do pray to always remember to include those that are 'lost' and have yet to come to God. Pray that their eyes be opened and that they realize that no matter what they've done in their lives that Jesus died for the remission of our sins and that all will be forgiven if asked sincerely. You guys just know that i am thankful for you all and pray for your strength in the Lord.
Just something to ponder on-<b>do you avoid saying things about your faith and being a christian to those you know will shoot you down?</b>
Love you guys."

ASKED YOU IF YOU BELIEVED IN GOD, WHAT WOULD YOU 
DO? 

SAY NO AND FEEL ASHAMED, THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? 

OR SAY 
YES, I DO, AND DIE STANDING UP FOR GOD? 
IF YOU WOULD SAY NO, DELETE THIS E-MAIL NOW

 

IF YOU WOULD SAY YES, 
AND STAND UP FOR JESUS CHRIST, PLEASE READ THIS AND (note)
 This is a true article that was printed in a 
southern newspaper less then a year ago 

TAKE A DEEP BREATH BEFORE READING THIS 


There was an atheist couple who had a child. 
The couple never told their daughter anything about the Lord. 

One night when the little girl was 5 years old, the parents fought 

with each other and the dad shot the Mom, 

Right in front of the child. Then, the dad shot himself.

The little girl watched it all. 

She then was sent to a foster home. 

The foster mother was a Christian and took the child to church. 

On the first day of Sunday School, the foster mother told the 
teacher that the girl had never heard of Jesus, and 
to have patience with her. The teacher held up a picture of Jesus

and said, ""Does anyone know who this is?"" 

The little girl said, ""I do, that's the man who was holding me 

the night my parents died."" If you believe this little girl is telling 
the truth, that even though she had never heard of Jesus, he 
still held her the night her parents died, then you will 
forward this to as many people as you can. 
Or you can delete it as if it never touched your heart."

>> In September 1960, I woke up one morning with six hungry babies and
just

>>
>>
>>
>> If there was a welfare system in effect in southern Indiana at that

>> time, I  certainly knew nothing about it. I scrubbed the kids until
they
>> looked  brand  new and then put on my best homemade dress. loaded
them
>> into the rusty  old  51 Chevy and drove off to find a job.
>>
>>
>>
>> The seven of us went to every factory, store and restaurant in our
small
>> town. No luck.
>>
>>
>>
>> The kids stayed crammed into the car and tried to be quiet while I
tried
>> to  convince whomever would listen that I was willing to learn or do
>> anything.  I had to have a job.
>>
>>
>>
>> Still no luck. The last place we went to, just a few miles out of
town,
>> was  an old Root Beer Barrel drive-in that had been converted to a
truck
>> stop. It  was called the Big Wheel.
>>
>>
>>
>> An old lady named Granny owned the place and she peeked out of the
>> window from time to time at all those kids. She needed someone on 
the

>> graveyard shift, 11 at night until seven in the morning. She paid 65
>> cents an hour and  I could start that night. I raced home and called
the
>> teenager down the  street that baby-sat for people. I bargained with
her
>> to come and sleep  on  my sofa for a dollar a night. She could 
arrive

>> with her pajamas on and  the  kids would already be asleep. This
seemed
>> like a good arrangement to  her, so  we made a deal.
>>
>>
>>
>> That night when the little ones and I knelt to say our prayers, we
all
>> thanked God for finding Mommy a job. And so I started at the Big
Wheel.
>>
>>
>>
>> When I got home in the mornings I woke the baby-sitter up and sent
her

nothing,
>> just  those beautiful brand new tires. Had angels taken up residence
in
>> Indiana ?  I  wondered.
>>
>>
>>
>> I made a deal with the local service station. In exchange for his

>> mounting  the new tires, I would clean up his office. I remember it
took

tires.
>>
>>
>>
>> I was now working six nights instead of five and it still wasn't
enough.
>> Christmas was coming and I knew there would be no money for toys for
the
>> kids.
>>
>>
>>
>> I found a can of red paint and started repairing and painting some
old
>> toys. Then hid them in the basement so there would be something for
Santa
>> to  deliver on Christmas morning. Clothes were a worry too. I was
sewing
>> patches  on top of patches on the boys pants and soon they would be
too
>> far gone  to repair.
>>
>>
>>
>> On Christmas Eve the usual customers were drinking coffee in the Big
>> Wheel.  These were the truckers, Les, Frank, and Jim, and a state
trooper
>> named  Joe.
>>
>>
>>
>> A few musicians were hanging around after a gig at the Legion and
were
>> dropping nickels in the pinball machine. The regulars all just sat
>> around and talked through the wee hours of the morning and then left
to
>> get  home before the sun came up.
>>
>>
>>
>> When it was time for me to go home at seven o'clock on Christmas
morning
>> to my amazement. My old battered Chevy was filled full to the top
with
>> boxes of all shapes and sizes. I quickly opened the driver's side
door,
>> crawled inside and kneeled in the front facing the back seat.
>>
>>
>>
>> Reaching back, I pulled off the lid of the top box. Inside was whole
>> case of  little blue jeans, sizes 2-10! I looked inside another box:
It
>> was full  of  shirts to go with the jeans. Then I peeked inside some
of
>> the other  boxes.  There was candy and nuts and bananas and bags of
>> groceries. There was an  enormous ham for baking, and canned
vegetables
>> and potatoes. There was  pudding and Jell-O and cookies, pie filling
and
>> flour. There was hole  bag of  laundry supplies and cleaning items.
And
>> there were five toy trucks and  one  beautiful little doll.
>>
>>
>>
>> As I drove back through empty streets as the sun slowly rose on the
most
>> amazing Christmas Day of my life, I was sobbing with gratitude. And 
I

>> will  never forget the joy on the faces of my little ones that
precious
>> morning.

>>
>>
>> Yes, there were angels in Indiana that long-ago December. And they
all

>>

>> THE POWER OF PRAYER. I believe that God only gives three answers to
>> prayer:
>>
>>
>>
>> 1. ""Yes!""
>>
>> 2. ""Not yet.""
>>
>> 3. ""I have something better in mind.""
>>
>>
>>
>> God still sits on the throne, the devil is a liar. You maybe going
>>
>> through a  tough time right now but God is getting ready to bless 
you
in
>> a way that  you  cannot imagine.
>>
>>
>>
>> My instructions were to pick four people that I wanted God to bless,
and
>> I  picked you.
>>
>>
>>
>> Please pass this to at least four people you want to be blessed and 
a

>> copy  back to me.
>>
>>
>>
>> This prayer is powerful, and prayer is one of the best gifts we
receive.
>> There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue to pray for 
one

>> another. Here is the prayer:....
>>
>>
>>
>> Father, I ask You to bless my friends, relatives and email buddies
>>
>> reading  this right now. Show them a new revelation of Your love and
>> power. Amen.

"event","I, Doti Wise, have made the decision that I need to get rid of some things in my life. Sure I can still have good teenager fun, but as long as it doesnt make me into a hypocrite. Sad to say I'm going to have to get rid of some of my friends, those that arent good for me...have to go. And sure its going to be hard, but with God all things are possible. I want to lead a healthy christian life, and seeing as how I am a big sister, and a sunday school teacher and I hang out with a few of my 'students' I need to set and example, so no more fighting, no more smokin, all of that has to go.


so yeh, went to dallas last sunday and came back this sunday...im a pimp gangsta....fA sheezy. i am ashamed of todays youth...and by todays youth i mean the 13 year olds that go around lyin about their age-theres a rat outside my window and its making a weird noise-and feelin on 20 year old men....we as the more mature youth need to do something about it...maybe set and example...""Have respect for yourselfe, theres time for all of that but that times not now, dont do it youll regret it..."" these are just a few things we can say to maybe help prevent hurt and pain....



IM STILL A P*I*M*P gAnGsTa. Yes sir. dont get mad or ill spray you with me haterade....


i sAW PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, ANGER MANAGEMENT, VAN HELSING, AND A FEW OTHER MOVIES that i havent seen in a while....anywho on with that whole things have to go stuff...




<lj-cut text=""answers for jin, read between the lines darling...."">Now of course...here comes the race thing, if i feel this slightest bit that one of my 'friends' is a racist...then im not going to continue on being friends with you.

Things come and go. Styles. Types of music. Im only human...and if yoy are surrounded by nothing but Rap, Hip Hop, and R&B...how are you not going to listent to it...and if one of my 'friends' cant handle the fact that I listen to one of the genres of music mentioned above...then im not going to continue on being friends with you.

My mom is the one who gave birth to me...so only I can be rude to her, not one of my 'friends' if you come into my house and disrespect my mom...then i can no longer be friends with you.

If I have contacted you and told you that we were going to church and to avoid conflict...please dont where any stars with circles around them b/c wether its upside down or not, they are after all just common church folk and its gonna look satanic anyways...commen sense, and if you cant respect my religious beliefs and if you are gonna argue with me about how its stupid to believe in something you dont think is there but then turn around and say you respect my beliefs....then i can no longer be friends with you.

its as simple as that. 
dont be an a hole and i wont have a problem with you, and there is such thing as denile, and not everybody is the enemy...so dont think im just sittin here being a female dog just b/c i have it out for you."

"event","10th grade 
As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to me. She was my so called ""best friend"". I stared at her long, silky hair, and wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it.

After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before and handed them to her. She said ""thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

11th grade

 
The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears, mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep.

She looked at me, said ""thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Senior year

The day before prom she walked to my locker. ""My date is sick"" she said; he's not going to go well, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates, we would go together just as ""best friends"". So we did. Prom night, after everything was over, I was standing at her front door step! I stared at her as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but she isn't think of me like that, and I know it. Then she said ""I had the best time, thanks!"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Graduation Day

A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before I could blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and cried as I hugged her. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder and said, ""you're my best friend, thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

A Few Years Later

Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting married now. I watched her say ""I do"" and drive off to her new life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn`t see me like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away, she came to me and said ""you came!"". She said ""thanks"" and kissed me on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Funeral

Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my ""best friend"". At the service, they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years. This is what it read:

I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesn't notice me like that, and I know it. I want to tell him, I want him to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love him but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me!

I wish I did too... I thought to my self, and I cried.

I Love You

ALL OF YOU WITH NATURALLY STRAIGHT HAIR...BE GLAD!!! phew...got that off my chest..so...its all good b/c ill be getting microbraids so thatll be a good 2, 3 months of not having to really do anything to it...so yeh..ill just do a story in another entry...
so today...we were parked infront of autozone...me and my ant shirely were just sittin there chillin out waitin for my mom and my little bro to come out...and this big dude..kinda bug eyed walks i guess it was maybe 9 feet away from our car...and he laughs when i look out my window...now my ant shirely isnt really my ant but you know how us black folk be...anywho shes a minister so she is really really nice to people....she says how are you doin on this fine day....and he starts laughin harder...by this time im like ok...hes high...or mentally ill-or whatever the politically correct term is...well he swats the air and pulls his hand back like he caught somethin and pretends to eat it...he does this numerous times...and he starts pointing to her...by then shes like...uh uh...and she says may god bless you...and my mom comes out and gets in the car and a few minutes later my little brother comes out...and the big dude looks and ant shirely and says..you have less than an hour to live..
ok
i keep having encounters with mean mean mean evil slow people that want to kill either me or someone around me...for those of you reading this that go to my school...you already know how i am with slow people...or the psycho ones that want to kill...like the dude that i run from...last year...he would come in the band hall look at me and you know that motion you do with the finger across the throat? he did that..every day...and he looked so sincere...
then at the car wash...there was a woman...she dressed up like a dude..well the girl that was helpin me scream out 'get your car wash for free'had to pretty much run inside the church building and it took my pastor...or bishop...whichever...and several women to get her to leave the poor girl alone...she wasnt doing anything and out of nowhere the dude/lady comes up and starts cursing at her...you could tell she had down syndrome or something like that...it was crazy...its not fair that people like that cant get the help they need b/c they cant afford it...its just flat out bull...that and their families should really keep them off of the street."

>DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN GIVE THE FOLLOWING SPEECH?
>
>My Fellow Americans: As you all know, the defeat of Iraq regime has 
been 
>completed.
>
>
>Since congress does not want to spend any more money on this war, our 
>mission in Iraq is complete.
>
>
>This morning I gave the order for a complete removal of all American 
forces 
>  from Iraq. This action will be complete within 30 days. It is now to 
>begin the reckoning.
>
>Before me, I have two lists. One list contains the names of countries 
which 
>have stood by our side during the Iraq conflict. This list is short. 
The 
>United Kingdom, Spain, Bulgaria, Australia, and Poland are some of the 
>countries listed there.
>
>The other list contains everyone not on the first list. Most of the 
world's 
>nations are on that list. My press secretary will be distributing 
copies of 
>both lists later this evening.
>
>Let me start by saying that effective immediately, foreign aid to 
those 
>nations on List 2 ceases immediately and  indefinitely. The money 
saved 
>during the first year alone will pretty much pay for the costs of the 
Iraqi 
>war.
>
>The American people are no longer  going to pour money into third 
world 
>Hell-holes and watch those government  leaders grow fat on corruption.
>
>Need help with a famine? Wrestling with an epidemic? Call France.
>
>In the future, together with Congress,  I will work to redirect this 
money 
>toward solving the vexing social problems  we still have at home. On 
that 
>note, a word to terrorist organizations. Screw with us and we will 
hunt you 
>down and eliminate you and all your  friends from the face of the 
earth.
>
>Thirsting for a gutsy country to terrorize? Try France, or maybe 
China.
>
>
>I am ordering the immediate severing of diplomatic relations with 
France, 
>Germany, and Russia. Thanks for all your help, comrades. We are 
retiring 
>from NATO as well. Bon  chance, mes amis.
>
>I have instructed the Mayor of New York City to begin towing the many 
UN 
>diplomatic vehicles located in Manhattan with more than two unpaid 
parking 
>tickets to sites where those vehicles will be stripped, shredded and 
>crushed. I don't care about whatever treaty pertains to this. You 
creeps 
>have tens of thousands of unpaid  tickets. Pay those tickets tomorrow 
or 
>watch your precious Benzes, Beamers and limos be turned over to some 
of the 
>finest chop shops in the world. I love New York .
>
>
>A special note to our neighbors. Canada is  on List 2. Since we are 
likely 
>to be seeing a lot more of each other, you folks might want to try not 
>pissing us off for a change.
>
>Mexico is also on List 2. President Fox and his entire corrupt

Yep,

you 
>to List 2 above: pick a country and move there. They care.

>
>
>
>Nearly a century of trying to help folks live a decent life around the

"event","so...i guess ill just start in on my dad and his side of the family...
those of you who know me...know and understand that i am a unique person...and how i feel about people that cant accept individuality and whatnot...well my dad and everyone sept uncle alfred and his wife serina (i think thats how you spell it) think females are sposed ta dress in little pink skirts and wear heels and arent sposed to wear make up til they are in their 50's and should be seen not heard...and are sposed to be stupid...
well....thats not me and i dont care who you are...im not wearing a skirt and heels (well i will for my mom if its like her b-day or mothers day(yes i wore a skirt on mom's day))
i usually go down to beaumont to stay with my black side for a couple of weeks...and i hate it...
i sleep over my grandmas and you guys know how i feel about unsanitary things and whatnot...but i am still a respectful person...my granma doesnt wash her pans she rinses them off and wipes them with a paper towel...so i hardly eat down there...the highlights of my visits are usually centered around the time i spend with my uncle and my bro..and when we go fishing(im in charge of crabbing)
WAIT! IM GONNA TELL YALL ABOUT CRABBING...YOU GET A BIG CHUNK OF MEAT...PUT IT ON A STRING TIE THE STRING TO A STICK AND SHOVE THE STICK IN THE GROUND AND THROW IT OUT IN THE WATER...THEN YOU GO OFF AND FISH FOR A LITTLE WHILE...LIKE 10 MINUTES AND YOU GET A NET AND YOU SLOWLY PULL THE MEAT OUT OF THE WATER...AND THEN YOU PUT THE NET OVER THE MEAT...AND YOU CATCH LIKE 4 CRABS...POOR THINGS...BUT IT IS REALLY FUN...I DONT EAT FISH OR CRABS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT...I JUST LIKE CATCHING THEM....
ok...now that that is out of my system...
during my last visit my little 6 year old cousin-tiarra-tells me 
""you know micheal(father)is very disappointed in you dorothy(my dad doesnt allow them to call me doti) he tells everybody about how you dress and how you wear make up...you know nobody in this family is sposed to wear make up""
so my mom calls me...and i tell her what she just told me...she tells my big bro rye...i love him so much...hes awesome...and he talks to dad about it...and dad denies the whole damn thing and insists that tiarra has made the whole damned thing up...ok...this 6 year old little girls has it out for me...
its now grandma buckley's bday and we take her to golden coral to eat
and she starts in on me...
""you know i just hate to see you with make up on-i had on a very thin line of eyeliner-it just doesnt do you any justice...""
i just say ok granma b/c i know my dad has put this in her head to say this to me...
"" you should wear skirts and oh! you would just be the cutest little thing if you wha wha whahh wah ahhhwhaah.."" yea i zoned off and nodded my head the whole time...
AND THEY WONDER WHY I DONT EVER REALLY WANNA GO DOWN THERE...."

"event","Once upon a time there was a big white ball, its had a blue triangle on it and it had a star in the middle of the triangle, it also had red stripes, 5 to be exact...everyone called the ball cuban and made the ball feel insufficient. the ball tryed to tell people how it FELT but people would just throw it back and forth...one day the BALL decided it would learn how to fly. and so it did...it flew everywhere...it flew so much that it got tired, so it decided to land but something was wrong..the ball knew how to fly but IT didnt know how to land. so it decided to just fall out of the sky, after all it was a ball...how much damage would falling out of the sky cause? so it fell...into a big pile of kangaroos...these were no ordinary kangaroos, they were purple AND they were wearing sun-glasses...and polka dotted swimming trunks...and SLIPPERS.
the ball had never seen kangaroos like this before. 
the kangaroos looked down at the ball, kicked it A little and asked it what its name was.
the ball said it didnt have a name...but people were always calling it cuban even though it wasnt in the least bit cuban...so maybe that was its name...but it made her sad when they called it cuban so maybe that wasnt its name...the ball was bad at making up its mind SO the kangaroos decided for it that they would call it ""no say"". the ball-no say-was happy it finally had a name, and maybe it would be able to FIT in...but just when no say thought this a big dingo came up and started jumping on it and rolling it around. no say yelled out for some one to help but all of the kangaroos had joined the game by kicking no say to ONE another (kinda like keep away). nO SAy decided the only way it was gonna get out of this situation was for it to dig a hole in the ground and bury itself and wait for them all to leave and then it would fly OUT and away.
so THATS what it did, no say stayed under GROUND FOR ALMOST an hour. no say finally decided thatit was time to fly and so it propelled itself out of the ground.
it flew over all of the kangaroos and the dingo, and they all laughed at no say. no say wondered why they were all laughing but dismissed it. no say was just glad to be out of there...
no say flew on and FOUND A NICE TREE AND CRASH landed in it and took a nap. while no say was sleeping it fell out of the tree and into a river.
it woke up surrounded by beavers...the beavers had built a wooden cage around no say. no say started to shiver, it had a cold...it caught it from being in the river.
no say sneezed all over THE BEAVERS and saw that not only was there spittle on the beavers faces but snot as well.
the beavers didnt look to happy and they started to move in...
duh duh duuuuuuuh!!!!!!!
to be continued...."

This would be it.
<br><br>
Over the course of 3 years John Wayne Gacy, a part time children's party clown, would go on to sodomize, torture and murder over 30 young men, burying most of the bodies under the floor boards of his home.
<br><br>
Gacy would use a chloroform soaked rag to render his victims unconscious, then take them home and tie them up in his basement. He would then proceed to torture them sexually, using a varying range of dildos and sexual toys, eventually strangling them to death with a 2x4 while raping them.

As a kitsune, you are clever, sensual, beautiful,<br>mysterious and effeminate (even if you are a<br>guy). You are also somewhat sneaky and like to<br>pull pranks on people, but otherwise you are<br>very pleasurable to be around.

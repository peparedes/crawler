feeling like shit...

being lied to...

loving someone that doesn't love you back...

not being able to get over things...

it really sucks...

Well tuesday I went to a ska show it was amazing, I got a fat lip but it was all ok because there were so many good looking guys there. I went with Melissa, Michelle, Nicole, and Courtney and met up with Adam, Heather, and Steve. It was a really fun show. The Planetsmashers and The Aquabats were there and some german chick that I wanted to shoot in the face. Yesterday Me Melissa Michelle and Nicole went out to eat at applebees, and afterwards we went to kmart and got cool things out of the 25cent machines. Then we climbed the rock pile and me and nicole threw stones at birds. After that we went to target and melissa and nicole got sweet hand warmers i want some also nicole got a cape its sweet. Then we went back to michelles and attempted to study for global. I think i failed because i suck at global o well. Today we had that exam and then i had group counseling, we get to watch the breakfast club next week i'm pretty excited. Then i hung out with chelle and ""studied for bio"" that didn't happen but i did finish my curtains. Tomorrow will suck because i have an exam (hopefully me and chelle will go to josh's in the morning) then i have a couselour meeting and 4, then i have to work. O well hopefully i'll get out of work early."

Well my day was pretty sucky at first and then it turned out to be a great day... at first I got in this huge fight with my sister because shes a bitch as we all know. and I am obviously a slut/whore/dyke so whatever. Shes a crazy bitch! Then I had my english exam, after that we went to michelles. Then me michelle melissa and mrs brown went to a cancer walk in grand island. We flirted with boys in an suv on the way there it was funny. The cancer walk was really fun we only walked a little. We were mostly looking for cute boys. We also went in the woods which was amazing I shimmied (sp?) up a tree which I was very proud of myself for doing...We also climbed this wall cuz there was an obstical course it was sweet. We also walke the log and made a tee-pee out of branches. It was amazing I want to go back there and hang out. I found a frog and named it vera and carried it around for a while, and freaked melissa out with it lol. We also spun in the huge field and played frisbee with our glowsticks. Then this band was playing TBS and I got real excited and this one boy was so cute! We finally found the cute boys and I asked them the name of their band and they wouldn't tell me(they were playing hard to get) so we figured out that they were just homosexuals. We accepted they didn't want us to drop dome. Tev...then we just ate hot dogs and left I had a great day! I'm glad I can have fun without drugs! :)"

"event","Well things have been going a little better I guess. I had group counseling yesterday I accually liked it I thought it would be alot different, but it was cool the people there are cool. This one boy Blake I think is very good looking. I want to get to know him, and this other boy I forget his name I think matt. He likes punk music and shit, so I think we will go to shows together and def. warped tour. I gave him my number so its pretty cool, tomorrow in group we get pizza(cuz its this one boys last one)! i'm pretty excited. I just hate the peeing part that sucks. But other than that I dunno just been hanging out with Michelle and Melissa. I had a softball game today our team is pretty bad. I hit the ball a few times I was proud, but i'm so used to playing with the retards that I guess I just suck. o well, I like playing with the retard better anyways. I wish so bad I could go to D's and use ""nessy"" lol. I miss my friends so much. I also wish pat would go back out with me but that doesn't look so good, I think Samalski gave up on me I dunno? We never really did get to hang out. Maybe we will at some point in the summer and i'll ""use him for a piece of ass"" right ashley? lol well I dunno 1 day left of school i'm excited. I have to go study for global now, which I will probably fail anyways. If anyone want to tutor me thats good in global please try cuz i need help. Peace out"

So we went to darien for the day and saw taking back sunday and the used on the superman. The show was sweet, i missed most of TBS because steve wasn't allowed in the show because of his jacket and i decided to be nice and stay with his sister chelsea. so we watched them from the lawn. i love them they will be at warped tour so i'm not that sad about missing them. then the used was amazing i love them, and blink so really cool they had these screens in the back and shit it was sweet. we had some drunks behind us they werre pretty funny. and travis disapeared off stage and apeared behind us and we all stood on our chairs and watched him do a drum solo it was amazing! so i'm glad i got to go. i wish so badly i could see D, Ashley, Dwane, Greg, Josh, Pat, Grant, and all of my friends and i wish i could go to edison and play gladiator that would make me so happy to bad it won't happen:("

Its already driving me insane this is just making things worse i need to get away from here and as fast as posible. My parents are making this seem way worse than it really is, they don't understand. i just feel that by the end of summer if i keep feeling like this i'll kill myself, seriously. i need my friends so bad right now and yet i can't even see most of them (if they really ever were my real friends) i guess i'll know who my real friends are now. i feel so shitty right now, will this feeling ever go away? i hope it does and soon! i hope this whole thing goes away.

You have no idea and never will untill you have tried they really aren't as bad as you think. I don't give all you sXe people a hard time so why must you give me such a hard time? get over it its not your life i'm ""fucking up"" its mine and i can make my own choices. i don't need people that don't even give two shits about me and could careless if i died (coughAJcough) to comment and just be rude and say stupid shit that i really don't need to hear. i just had to say that, anyways i went to glen falls the other day for the first time it was so amazing! i went with Greg, Ashley, Dwayne and Pat. it was so pretty and we had alot of fun. we also climbed melissa's treee which had to be done it was nice. I worked tonight from 5-10 and i work tomorrow night at 5-10 also. and i'll have till like 12:30-1 if anyone wants to hang out because i'll probably get ditched again. and end up walking around by myself which sucks but o well. someone call me tomorrow if you wannt hang out...peace"

But then saturday came and we played in the woods, me michelle and katie were run aways. We found this really sweet tree branch i loved it untill i fell off of it like 7 times lol that sucked but it turned out to be really fun. We found our way back and just sat around and talked. Then gary lora and maria got there. We figured we wouldn't have enough room so mrs brown talked to the owner and he said we could use another cabin for free so it was sweet. We went to tops and on the way there me and gary were drinking mikes hard lemonade in the trunk it was fun. Then we got back and we all went down to the other cabin (me maria lora gary katie and chelle) we played loaded questions and sat around and talked. Then michelle and katie left at about 12. But me maria lora and gary stayed. and we were all having a great time maria kept calling random people and she called tim and she talked to him for a while. Then we tried going to sleep but me and maria were talking alot. and i guess we were really loud so gary came into the room and woke me up so i was wide awake and ready to go outside and play in the snow(whihc never happend) we were going to watch the sunrise that didn't happen either. So me and gary left the room and let maria sleep because she was really tired i guess so maria and lora were sleeping and me and gary were playing with cards building sweet castles. Then gary asked if i wanted to do shots with him so i was like sure. so he went and got the stuff out of the other room and we found a sweet sXe shot glass. and we took a few shots i was crazy it was so much fun. me and gary we just basically up all night. i don't really remember what we did after that but i remember gary telling me he was going to bad and he gave me a hug and left me all alone and i was scared so i sat on the couch and cried (i don't know why) and then i got up and started playing with fire and lighting pencils on fi, and scraping them with a knife. and i guess i was being loud because lora and gary came out. it seemed like i was alone for a really long time but gary says it was only like 10 mins. i didn't like it. so we all sat around the table for a while lora had some koolaid. then we decided to go to sleep me lora and gary all slept in the same bed it was a tight fit but we did it. me and lora were talking for a while then gary scared the shit out of us by waking up all of a sudden because he got shot in his dream it scared us then we went to bed and gary for some odd reason fell asleep with his arms around me i guess so i wouldn't fall off the bed? but it was like a chain it was lora gary and then me. So i got about 2 and a half hours of sleep last night i'm kinda tired. but i had a sweet time. i'm glad that i stayed in the cabin with them. there are some more details in loras journal (dtlb182) if you want to read that. and then sunday we pretty much just packed and got ready to leave. that was by far the best winter camping ever!!! i can't wait for gymnastics and tanning!"

Then me and lora were bored and decided we wanted to go tanning. So we did then sarah pann called me so we walked up to bob evans to see dave (sarah wanted to) and he wasn't even there. But its all good because we had a fun walk. We almost got hit my like 3 cars and a semi. and we had to climb like a mountain, and i almost fell on the ice like 20 times. But it was fun. Then on the walk home we stopped in krispy kream and julie was working and so we got a free dozen donuts and a drink which is sweet then i called my dad and he came and got us, and that was my day. i had a good time. Tomorrow is ski club but i don't really feel like going i don't know why but i will still end up going anyways.

"event","i hate myself for doing this, why do i wait around for someone i know will never call. if you don't want to hang out then why can't you just say so, just say katie i don't want to hang out today, you don't have to just blow me off and say you'll call after you eat and then never call, you could atleast call and tell me not to wait around for your call and not make up fake excuses of why you can't hang out, instead of letting me sit around and cry all day. i can't belive i'm doing this. i hate this.

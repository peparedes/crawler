"event","Wow... ok so today was just stupid. I can't find my graphing calculator anywhere and I HAVE to have it tomorrow for my quiz. And health is just pointless, and then lunch was ok I guess, James is totally the funniest person ever. Except maybe Isaac. He's funny too. So anyway, James and I were both freaking out about homework we hadn't done and stuff so that was awesome. And then some random kid whose name I can never remember was like, ""Can I tell you something?"" and I was like, ""Um...yeah."" and he's like, ""You're really pretty."" And I said, ""Ok."" and sat down. I mean, seriously, what was I supposed to say? ""Um... thanks. You're... really pretty... too..."" And then today was picture day (I know, sooo excting) so we missed like half of English which is always great. But yeah, so then Brittany, Michelle and I stopped to talk to Ms. Dickson and were late coming back so we made up some stuff and she believed us so we didn't get in trouble. Yeah. So then I went off to golf/bowling (best class ever) but I couldn't golf because my back hurt really bad so I just chilled with Eric Halsey, Anna Foster, Sean Finan, and the coolest kid ever, David. Then in A Cappella we went over a bunch of papers and forms and hardly did any singing which was dumb. But when we did sing Mrs. Holdren was all like ""Good job guys! You're beating the ladies!"" which was complete crap because she hardly warmed us up at all so I was like well yeah of course they're doing better, you big stupid. It was just silly. Then in AP US History we really did nothing so... yeah. So then I went home. And that's where I am now. Home. Ok. So I'm sure that was totally the most exciting thing you've heard all day. Yeah.... right..."

"event","Well, I suppose I will update this for the whole maybe 2 people that read this piece of crap. School has now begun and let me tell you, it is sure the HIGHLIGHT of my LIFE. Not. But I guess this year won't be too bad. As usual, I am a loser and I have no friends. Oh well. My math teacher is SOOO freaking funny. He's totally one of the best teachers I've ever had. EVER. but anyway, I guess... I'm going to go... do something else... now...

Right.........."

"event","Well... This summer has been pretty awesome. Too bad everyone is leaving. So many people are going off to college. I'm gonna miss them all. I miss Rachel Workman so much already.

I've got a ton of summer reading left to do. I'm really not looking forward to school starting. I don't like Princeton. Oh well.

Life is very confusing. I don't understand why things are the way they are sometimes.

""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.""
-Romans 8:28

I like that verse. Well I'm gonna go do something else."

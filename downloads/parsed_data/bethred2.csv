"event","Today was my last day in HIGH SCHOOL!!  It was also senior overalls day.  The only class that i actually did work in was French.  :(  I seemed to be hyper in my classes, but i think it was due to the fact that i was officially done with school.  I was walking to my car after 5th today and realize that most of the car windows all had 05 written on them.  It was a good/ cute idea for senior prank until some cars had rude things written on them.  Then i went to a friends house to pick up a parking permit for next week since i might not be able to park in the Sr. Lot.  I  went to drop of the film of my jewelry pictures so that i could upload them later and then decied to head home to clean up my room.  It was a mess and i couldnt find anything in it, plus i hate when my room is messy so it was due for a clean up.  Later i went back to the film store, picked up the beautiful pics, and then went to the Merf to visit Maytal and chat about life.  

So tonight i went to dinner with my parents.  I finally got my margarita for my birthday.  I think they put a lot more alcohol and less margarita but it was still good.  Then me and pam hung out tonight and just take one of those relaxing nights out.  We went to Academy to get her shorts, and then off to dessert gallery.  She got food and we were going to play connect four.  The only problem was that there were only red pieces instead of red and black, and the base to hold the pieces in was missing.  We found clue and played that instead.  The only problem with clue and two players is that its easy to figure out who did what with what weapon and where.  I told pam how to figure it out and she got the hang of it. 

Next we went to the waterwall just to stare at its beauty and talk.  Around 10 the lights went out and the water stopped flowing.  We were like, ehh, who cares and just sat there continuing talking.  Around 10:20 the weird security person had her horn on, like a siren, and on the mega phone was like "" the park closes at 10 you need to leave""  um.. isnt this a public park to be at??  Whatever we left and she took me home since i cant drive my car at night.  The headlights on the passenger's side are facing down and not out so its harder to see at night.  

Well im off to bed, but it was a nice evening.  Thanks pam.  Good night world, sleep well"

"event","Ok so here it goes for my first entry.  I can only hope that this will work.  So only one real day of school left, then i go next week for senior activites like practice for graduation and i have one final due to a really bad teacher that cant teach.  It will go by faster than i think so thats good to know.

Last night was crazy.  For those who dont know, i was in a car accident.  If i try to expain it here, it sounds stupid, but i did what i could to not hit a car, the stupid car in front of me never slowed down and just changed lanes like there wasnt anything in front of him.  Basically i slammed on my brakes and hit a car.  It sucks because officaly its my fault since i was the last car, but i couldnt have done anything different than i did.  

Today i went to origins to buy the makeup that they used for prom.  Now if only i can remember how to put it on properly.  lol.  Then i decided to walk around the galleria just to walk and kind of clear my mind of the accident.  Im paranoid that the lights are going to fall off when im driving.  

I wish the weekend was coming faster.  This week seems like it went slow but in reality it was fast being that i left most of my classes to ""work on my jewelry""  I actually did most of the time, otherwise i was just in the room talking to my friends.

Well im out to write thank you notes for my graduation gifts, and get ready for the season finale of The OC."

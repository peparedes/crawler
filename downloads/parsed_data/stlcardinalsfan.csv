"event","Hi Everyone, How are ya'll doing? I am just fine thanks. I wanted to write and tell you all a little bit about the fun week-end I have had!! On Friday night I went to my friend Allison's birthday party. I am soo happy I went, it was alot of fun! We ate pizza, drank yummy Diet Coke and watched the movie: ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", hey Anna, I think I might still be able to hear the psycho man stabbing into the flesh of those poor people :( yucky! For any of you who don't know, I have never been one for scary movies for the most part because I can't stand blood. hehe Well, it was fun watching anyway because I had never seen it. The night ended with text messages to guyfriends and boyfriends...etc. I for one did not get mixed up in all that hype, lol.On Saturday Allison, Timbo and I took a little trip to the bowling alley for Cosmic Bowling, yes..I played the role of the ""Third Wheel"" but it was alot of fun. I think I won the majority of the games, but who said I was bragging? :) Saturday night around 7:15 Allison, Emily, Jack, Trent and I met up at school to see the fall play, that was one good time, let me tell you..not necessarily the plan being good, I mean it was satisfactory but the company was better. :) After the play we walked out to the parking lot and began getting in our cars, the majority of people were in their cars when we decided we should go back in and ask Tim if he wanted to come to Emily's house with us so I was the lucky one who got sent back in to get him. I ran inside and didnt think to wipe my wet shoes off so I went sliding across the floor, that was fun but I'm glad I didn't fall on my ass, that would have been embarassing. I ran in and talked to Tim and he said he had to call his mom and make sure the plans were ok, so I ran back outside, got Trent's phone from him, ran back inside to the Library and let Tim use the phone and then ran back out to the parking lot to tell everyone the plans. Finally after the car ride to Emily's that I spent sticking my head out the window talking to Jack and flicking him off we got back to her house. The night was alot of fun but its too long to type. Let's just say I was the life of the party, lol. Well thats all for now. I will write again soon. TTYL, byebye :)"

"event","Hi Everybody!! Wow, it has been forever since I tapped into the Live Journal hype! What's up? I'll tell you what's up.. This weekend is our homecoming at my highschool. Last night was the football game, so what did I do? I went up to the football game and met up with some of my friends. Right as the football game was supposed to start the sky opened up and decided to rain. How nice (sarcastic), well thats what we thought anyway.. lol I talked to my friends and we came up with the majority vote that we would leave and go out to eat at halftime, and so we did. The halftime buzzer went off and we headed to our cars. I drove myself home and my friends met at my house so I could lead them to the restaurant. On the way we stopped down the street at one of our friends house so he could drop his car off and drive with his girlfriend (another one of my friends, hehe). When they were finally ready to go we headed for the restaurant. Since my friends live quite a ways from my house they had never been to this restaurant before, so I wanted to introduce them to ""My neck of the woods"" for a change. We got to the restaurant and quickly ordered our food because we were really hungry. I ordered a salad and pizza for my friend and I to share. The food was great, I think everyone enjoyed it. After dinner 2 of my girls and I went cruising in my auto. We drove around town a bit, stopped in at my work so they could see the place and then stopped at the gradeschool cafeteria where my family had been involved in a trick or treating party. By the time we got there they had already started cleaning up so they told us not to go inside. My friends and I got back into my car and headed back to my house in the rain. We hung out on my porch for awhile and then they decided it was time to head home since it was still raining. The night was great! I had alot of fun!! I can't wait until the dance tonight. Well I gotta go work on my research paper. See you all real soon! ByeBye :)"

"event","Hi Guys- What's up? I just got in from a night-o-fun. I met a group of friends (Allison, Jeff, DJ, Anna, Mallory, Ryan, and Kevin) up at the bowling alley and we went Cosmic Bowling. It was alot of fun. I didn't start off so good considering I got a few gutter balls the first few frames, but thats ok.. I passed everybody up with my Turkey (3 Strikes In A Row!!). It was awesome, my high score was only a 123 but thats ok. I have the song ""Girlfriend"" in my head now eversince they played it at the Bowling Alley tonight. Tonight was my first time meeting Ryan and Kevin, they are pretty cool guys. Well I work tomorrow morning @ 9:00 a.m. so I probably won't hang around too long. Um, talk to you all later. Adios!"

"event","Hey, yeah..I'm talking to you! If this is the guy from Dierbergs then here is my little journal entry dedicated to you. I had helped my mom load groceries into the trunk and then backed out of our parking space. I drove down the aisle and made a stop to let pedestrians cross. One of these people happened to be the guy who had been sent out to get carts. I sat there waiting to make my right turn as he SLOWLY walked across the street. It was classic because as he was walking he just stared at my mom and I sitting there waiting for him. At that point my mom made a comment: ""This guy's on drugs."" I proceeded to laugh and he was probably wondering what I was laughing at. I made my turn and drove on down the street in front of the grocery store but it was great. I guess you had to be there... I then came home and unloaded the groceries and took them downstairs.. That's always fun, lol. Now I'm sitting here waiting for the oven to heat so we can re-heat the pizza we are going to have for dinner tonight. YUMMY! I can't wait to eat it. After dinner I'm planning on going to the Y to work out. It'll be alot of fun I'm sure, unless the place is packed. Well that's all for now. Catch ya later. Ciao Chicos/Chicas!!"

"event","Hey, Sorry I haven't written in awhile, my computer wouldn't let this web-site load so I haven't had a chance to update my journal in awhile. Um, so here's the Jewels News... Friday night I spent my night outside in the rain waiting for AAA to come and fix our flat tire. Yes, thats right, it all started when my dad and I were on our way to pick my younger sister up from a Birthday Party. We were driving down the road and the car started making a funny noise, Well it had been raining all evening so we figured it was the wet roads causing the car to make this noise..much to our suprise when we pulled over to check things out we had a flat tire. My dad then proceeded to call AAA for assistance and they said it would be a good 35-60 minutes before someone would be out there with a truck. Luckily there was a St. Louis Bread Co. in the shopping center so I ventured on over to check things out and see how late they were open. The chick in the bakery said they were open to 9:00. Nice...atleast we could get out of the car and go somewhere where we wouldn't get wet. So once my sister was dropped off by one of the other parents we decided to grab a bite to eat at Bread Co. It wasn't much, but we figured it would hold us over until we got something else to eat. About 60 minutes went by and a AAA tow truck came to help us out. Well when my dad ventured outside to talk to the guy he found out one of our other tires had gone flat while we were sitting there. How Nice.. NOT! So the guy said theyd have to send out a flatbed since we had 2 flat tires on the same side of the car. We sat there for a few more minutes while my mom headed up in our direction with another car to pick us up. She got there just as the flatbed was pulling up to tow our car. We sat in the car and watched the poor guy stand in the rain and hook our car up to this flatbed truck so he could tow it to DOBBS where we would then have it fixed when DOBBS opened in the morning. We drove to the shopping center where DOBBS is located and dropped our car off. We decided it had been a long night and we headed home. We had nachos and soda for dinner. YUMMY! :) On Saturday I went out to lunch with some friends: Allison and Emily. We ate at Ruby Tuesday's and the food was really yummy. On Sunday (today) I went to church. When we arrived for church the power was out so they we're doing the readings using bug lamps so they could see.. it was very interesting, better than any Easter Vigil I'd ever been to. lol The power eventually came back on during the Responsorial Psalm, but it was interesting while it lasted. Today it persisted to rain. I took my younger sisters to the Y to go swimming and came home when the clouds began to form incase there was a storm moving in, which I dont think ever came, cause I dont remember any rain. I then took a nap this afternoon because I was soo bored. I woke up around 5:00 and enjoyed the yummy steak my parents had prepared for us. It is now 10:01 or so on a Sunday night and I have done just about slim to nothing that had anything whatsoever to do with school. It's been an ok week-end, hopefully the week-ends will get better as school comes to a well needed end. I can't wait for summer. Well thats about all I have to say for now. I hope you all enjoyed my journal. Leave me a note and I'll catch ya later. Adios Chicas/Chicos"

"event","Wow, I can't believe this is my 3rd journal entry already.. Well today more than any day I realized how much I wish the week-ends were longer. I definately never have enough time to do the things I need to do. It's 3:41 on a Sunday afternoon and I havent even started my homework... I hate school, I can't wait until summer vacation!! AHHH! Well anyways nothings ever easy so I guess it's just life. Nothing really too exciting happened this week-end, besides the fact that I saw Eddie at the shoe store. hehe  so I'm not going to make this a long journal entry.. Well I'll write again soon. Have a good afternoon everybody!! *High Five* ByeBye"

"event","Well it's 11:51 PM and I am wide awake..in some ways I guess that could be considered ""Paradise"" or maybe not, but anyway that doesn't really matter, does it? This week was long and pretty much un-eventful. I think the most exciting thing would have to be that I went to the Cardinals game again tonight. Once again I received the 21 and over attendance prize or (whatever you want to call it). Exciting huh? I thought so... Well they won again so that was cool. Tomorrow I'm planning on going to the YMCA in the morning to work out and then do something fun tomorrow night. Boy how I love the week-ends..really not too much homework and plenty of freedom for staying up until all hours of the night :) hehe. Well thats all I have to say, hopefully my next entry will be a little bit more exciting. Seeya later.. Goodnight and Sweet Dreams peeps. I'll write again soon I promise."

"event","Hi Everyone!! Yes, I am finally part of the Live Journal hipe. I guess this is what's it's all about huh? Well anyways..here you will get to know a little bit about me. I'm going to start off by telling you about this totally awesome guy named Eddie. 
     Yesterday around 6:30 or so my mom and I decided to go to the Mall and pick up the shoes I had ordered @ our favorite shoe store.... When we got there all of the employees were in the back and came out when they heard us come in. So my mom told them we had ordered some shoes so they went to the back to get them for us. Eddie is the one who brought em out and tried them on me... He is sooo adorable :). So we got to talking and he said ""You came in a few weeks ago, Didn't you?"" and I said ""Yes"", then I made some comment to the girl at the counter about how the store was kinda empty and he made a comment on how when I came in it was the big Easter rush and I said ""Yeah, last minute Easter shoppers..."" and he said ""Yeah, we even had people coming in on Saturday night, but of course we didn't have any shoes left."" and I just smiled.. lol 
        After he laced up my shoes I walked around in them to see if they fit, and they were sliding off my feet so I told him and he said ""I can try to tighter the laces (however you spell that..) for you.."" and I was like ""ok"" so I sat back down and he tightened them for me. After he laced up my shoes he realized he had tied the last two and he said ""I put the laces through the last two holes too, does that bother you?"" and I said ""No, as long as they stay on my feet it's ALL GOOD"" and he said ""I just have to ask, some people are really picky about it..."" 
        So I walked around in em but they kept sliding off so he said he'd let Ginger take a look at them and she agreed that they were too big. I love Ginger, she is the sweetest thing. So we agreed to forget about the shoes and try re-ordering some.. He went up to the counter and looked up my old pair of shoes on the computer so we could order some new ones. He gave it to the girl who was at the register and she rang it up and gave my mom her money back.
        He went to help someone else, but it was fun while it lasted. I think it was some of the most fun I've had in that shoe store in awhile :). It's kinda strange, the last time I was in there I considered getting a job there, hmmm.. find anything strange about that? 
       So then I started talking to Ginger while I was putting my sandals back on and I felt soo embarassed because I hate when people can see my bare feet and I'm sure Eddie did if he was looking in my direction when I took my socks off to put my sandals back on. AHHH! lol. When I finished talking to Ginger I said goodbye to her and headed for the door. I should have said something to Eddie...Oh-well, Hopefully I'll see him again when I go to pick my new order of shoes up ;). 

       Tonight I drove to work by myself for the first time. It was a total energy rush!! I had complete control of the car and the radio and everything. Rock On. So Anyways, thats about all I have to say for right now. I'll try to keep this journal updated as much as possible. Talk to you all later!!"

Billy needs to go back to normal. Him being the way he is now... I'm not sure what that is... I don't like it. I'd so prefer him being mad or something. Just not... I don't know... more lifeless then usual? I don't know what to call it, but it's like he's less Billy-like. It's kinda sad.

"event","Gah. What a GREAT week. My birthday... ehhh. I don't feel like talking about that one. LA...the most exciting thing that's happened here is that I got a hookah.

I've had...a bad day. I woke up with no one home. No one was in the Hotel, and more then that, I couldn't find a fucking note from my parental or even any fucking food. She decided to keep the car another day, even though we have no money to spend anymore, and stay another night in LA. She found a place to work. Now all she needs is a place to live. I took a shower and then started coughing up a pretty good amount of blood. Got out and called Colleen because...I don't know why. Mom and Mema came back around THREE. I had coffee and then we went to go pick up Trevor so that we could bring him back for Mema to see. Instead... we hung around the frat house. I went looking through my brothers stuff and then he pulled me aside to tell me a fat secret that only our parents don't know. All of his friends at the frat house know. Everyone else knows. He can't afford to buy his own groceries, even though he has a job, so he does things I don't approve of but I had to pretend to understand anyway. I can't tell him not to do it because he doesn't have enough money... So I'm sending him all of my allowance plus birthday cash so he can maybe knock it off a bit. I really hope... Dad won't give him money. He's screwed because he won't come back so he won't have to deal with a fucked up family and fighting parents. He bought me lots of things for my birthday and I've already paid for half by slipping money in his pocket. Gah. Urban Outfitters makes me feel bad about myself. I did get some things, granted, but I looked like shit in everything else. I'm NEVER going back in there. The mirrors... the clothes... I felt like shit. I feel like shit. <b>And for those of you who I don't feel like naming or even if I don't know about you thinking this, I'm not asking you to tell me I'm pretty. I'm stating a fact that I don't fucking feel pretty so don't even. I will fucking rip you apart.</b>

<marquee> I will pwn you. </marquee>



Anyway... HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It pisses me off a lot though. I've given parties to my friends countless times, but I never get one back. How the fuck is this fair?

<P>How can someone be in love with two people at once? How can <EM>I</EM> be in love with two people at once? I didn't think I could love one.</P>
<P>Two very, VERY different people.</P>
<P>One is like... different. He gets jealous. He can be really sweet and nice, and we can also play&nbsp;around. Lots of weird playing.&nbsp;He's got a temper sometimes, or he can. But he took me for granted. Hmm... I can still love him and do nothing about it and I might be planning to do just that. I don't know though. I could let my once broken heart heal and then fuck it up once again. But can I really let myself do that? Or can I really deprive myself of what I really want?</P>
<P>The other one... He never gets jealous and he believes in no sex til thatthingimsoneverdoing. He's really, REALLY sweet and overly nice all the time. He's a real gentleman. He treats me like I'm worth everything to him. He's always loved me like that and he's never treated me otherwise. He wants our relationship to be how it was. We kiss, we play... and when I get back to California he wants me to be dating other people... even though he knows how much I'm gonna miss him. It's not like he's gonna go after other girls either because he's made it clear which one he wants.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The problem is... I love both of them so much... I shouldn't... But I do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>__________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>So anyway. I'm in Oregon. Things are really going great, but I also want to be at home. I miss California and all of my friends. Yes, I MISS YOU. Punkards. Anyway. It's nice weather here. I like Sean. He cracks me up. First day Sean and </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I didn't get to finish that because Sean came upstairs with a mask on and I screamed bloody murder. And then he like... tackled me. It was funny. </P>
<P>Sean and I on the first day went with his youth group buddies and played Capture the Flag for like FOUR HOURS. Personally, I think it would have been better if I was in California and I had fast runners on my team. Hahaha. I know who I'd pick, too.</P>
<P>Second day we went to the pool, I think, and goofed off. It was totally great.</P>
<P>Third day... which was yesterday... what did I do? Oh. We went off to a river thing, A COLD ONE, and a lake and goofed off, it was really great.... :)</P>
<P>Today... We're going&nbsp;to a concert. mewithoutyou at Club Meow Meow. This cracks me up. I love Oregon...except for the bugs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Btw, VINCE. I hope you read this. Project 86. Look 'em up. It's a rock group. You'd like it. Really. And... trust me.</P>

"event","<P>This past week has been interesting. VERY interesting. Sean has been here for about a week now. And know what, know WHAT? I might be going back to Oregon. And then I'll be going to LA. (Steven. For my birthday this still means you're taking Reno and I on a double date with you and Jonas even if I'm not going to be there on my birthday.)</P>
<P>I've been staying in a hotel all weekend. Fucking cousins. I hate my cousins but I was forced to see them two days in a fucking row. Friday, I went to Charlie and the Chocolate factory with Baba and then to dinner with the Rentals and then to Borders for Harry Potter. Saturday Sean and I made plans for EARLY, EARLY in the morning like 8:30 and hung out until 12. We went around to the campus and then off the the arboritum or however you spell it. It was... really cool... And then my day got ruined by going over to my cousins. I read Harry Potter and took a nap (which is great). Then I went out with Colleen to Borders and Jamba Juice. Sunday, which was today, I had to see my cousins again. Then... Did Seans party thing today. (I couldn't get ahold of you, Reno, so don't hate me.)&nbsp;It was alright. No one ate anything except those GREAT cupcakes that Sammo made. (Ashley has a FAT crush on Josh and therefore was being a bad hostess.) We went into Manor and goofed off. Played some football or whatever in water and that was cool except for the fact that John was like... trying to kill me with the fucking football. After we were done with that we went over to Josh's and then over to Ashley's and then we had to leave her house, so I went over to Josh's again. Josh and I hung out for a little bit until Anthony and Oli (who fucking bit me really hard... not that it was bad, actually, but it was on Harry Potter night)&nbsp;came over and we started watching Blade II, which was okay. Sean came over, too and we all just sat around eating REALLY FUCKING BRILLIANTLY GOOD pizza and watching that.</P>
<P>I got a lot of crap today from almost everyone about Sean. How am I supposed to know if I'm in some sort of relationship that isn't friendy with him if he doesn't tell me?! I still don't know... I'm almost afraid to ask. Apparently Ashleys dad was asking him about me. *embarrassed face* And I guess the only reason I'm comfortable writing about this stuff (mainly, guys) in my journal is because I know they (or he) doesn't read it. Muaha. Otherwise I'd feel like a dumbass.</P>
<P>Oh yeah. Out of today I gained a fat cut on the back of my heel, two shirts that aren't mine (one about girls and then another called hmmm....""HOOTERS"") and they are Josh's, two ps2 video games (that i REALLY want to play and)&nbsp;that I have to give back, two cds that&nbsp;I'm burning&nbsp;and a pair of pants. These are guy pants. They were Joshs pants but Joshs mom said I had to have them because my ""butt looks good in those."" Haha, Joshs mom is so cool. So is his little sister! She's three now! She's so cute...So big, too. She's grown up a lot since I've seen her.</P>
<P>It feels good to be hanging out with guys again. I like being around guys because a) I can steal their clothes and mostlikely fit into them, b) they're not high matinence or however you spell it, and c) they kinda just except you for who you are, mistakes and all... or most of them do.</P>
<P>And now I'm gonna go off with my brand SPANKIN new journal and update the things I think people don't want to read in here.</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>I smell like Josh.</P>"

"event","He's really gentlemanly. Yeah, I know I'm supposed to be like... non-traditional like... but see, it's really nice to have someone doing the whole traditional type thing. Opening doors, paying for stuff, being overall completely nice, and giving me a hand down from a fence (:)). It was nice. The whole evening was great. It's nice having him to myself again. It used to be like that all the time and ... then he moved. He really is a great guy. Last night I went through all the letters he gave to me. I never appreciated him enough. Or at all.

Shavaun moved, btw. To Santa Barbara, or Santa something or other. It's really depressing.

Went to the pool with Mitali today to meet Andy. Met up with Conner and stuff. Am going thursday to see Connor and Runyon in the same place at once.

Haha, thought of something. If I keep hanging out with Sean as much as I am, I may end up as a *gasp and sour face* NON-SMOKER. He got in town on Sunday, and it's tuesday now. I've smoked about... 2 sunday. 3 yesterday. and a half of one today. GO ME. But I think I don't mind.

How strange."

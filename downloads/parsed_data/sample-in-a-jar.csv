"event","This is strange.  The internet is like some kind of vacuum.  It's full but completely empty at the same time.  I guess life is like that, though.  I think about the internet and I think ""wow, a worldwide universe where computers interact with computers and there are humans behind those computers but they're invisible.  And essentially all of the world's shared information is immediately available.  Most things a person wonders about can be explained or answered in maybe 5 seconds, unless you have dial up in which case it takes more like 5 minutes.  But all in all that's a pretty good track record.""  And then I sit at my computer.  At this object in my house more powerful than most.  I sit in my house with this reasonably sized box shaped thing with wires and I can access infinity.  That is how the internet is like life.  The possibilities are so endless but I seem to limit myself to core web sites.  I seem to be limited to my space, to where I live, to my house, to Newton.  And when I think about that life seems so empty.  So known, so repetitive.  But I could walk out of my door today and find any number of things.  There are approximately 6 billion people in the world, and that alone makes my mind reel.  I can't even seem to fathom that number, let alone the fact that each person has his or her own consciousness.  Within this world there are 6 billion seperate worlds, but they do not exist alone.  They interact with each other.  This must be what the dimensions are like.  And so worlds contain other worlds and bounce off of each other.  I think of humans as atoms or cells.  And then I think of all of human kind's known information.  And then I think that life is so commandingly vast.  Somehow I suppose that Happiness is a sort of balance.  A sort of acknowledgment of the vast beauty and expanse of the world, a curiosity about that and an engagement in it.  And then also A comfort in where you are.  Somehow I need to be somewhere that is big enough (not in size, more in meaning) so I can feel like I'm free, like I'm not held down and like the whole world is open to me, but that at the same time like I'm home.  That's what I want in college.  I guess that's what I want in a partner.  I just want to be happy.  I wonder if my whole life will be a struggle towards that end.  I wonder if I'll always experience moments or periods of time where I'm happy, but always have something bringing me down.  I wonder if it's just about learning about myself.  I wonder if it will get easier.  Or maybe at 80 I'll be in the same place.  But something tells me i have the entire world to learn about, and that I've harldy even started.  Somehow I try to tackle the concept of infinity.  The fact that I can't is scary.  It is also comforting, because it means that the ideas I have of what death is like are there because of my own mind.  My own limited mind.  So limited, in fact, that I can't even grasp the most basic concept of the universe-- infinity.  I listen to music, or I look at a lake, or at trees, or at the ocean, or at people I love, and I think that the world is beautiful.  No matter how ugly it is sometimes, or how empty it feels, I become overwhelmed by this incredible beauty.  And this is my spirituality.  This is my religion."

"event","I haven't written in my livejournal since the end of the summer.  I hate facebook, because it is uninteresting and impersonal.  I always valued livejournal as a way to connect with the world... to say whatever I wanted and have people read it.  And I miss this outlet.  But at the same time it just doesn't feel the same as it used to.

maybe it's the reason Daniel and I broke up...I became at odds with livejournal and lost this valuable creative and emotional outlet and then I FELL APART!  and that manifested itself in the way I expressed my feelings, and in turn, led to an ultimate faliure in the relationship.  But really I have no idea what's happened.  really I have no idea about anything at all.  I'm just confused and closed off and gone and too present and nothing.

I started my livejournal with Valentine's day, and I suppose I'm ending it on the eve of another Valentines day.  I don't know what I'll do with my life, and I have no idea how I'll get through the rest of high school.  I just want out.

Happy Valentines Day Everyone and No one and Livejournal.  You've been good and bad and there for me."

"event","so I started out my last post by saying essentially that I was dissappointed by the people around me who say they care about politics and dislike Bush and then complain that holding signs in newton is pointless.  and to that very post I got comments from people saying exactly that.  so wait you're saying that the people in newton already agree with me...like who agrees with me...YOU?!  hah.  that's funny.  no really it just makes me laugh.  only because YOU are the complacent ones that I'm talking about.  you say you care but aren't willing to do what you can to be proactive.  and ON TOP OF that, you somehow think it's okay to put me down for wanting to change things.  no really, i just think it's rediculous and silly and incredibly, incredibly hipocrytical.  instead of saying you'll join the club and maybe work on ways you think would be better to inspire change, you tell me how MY plans won't work.  I hope that makes you feel better about being lazy.  oh and complacent which is much much worse."

"event","when I hear people's reactions when I tell them that I'm starting a club, I realize more and more that the people in Newton are no better than anyone else.  I hear constantly that Newton is a place where the people are liberal and educated, but I constantly see contradictions, especially among its youth.  I tell people about my ambition to change something, and they say ""you'll never change anything by standing around and holding signs in front of people who already agree with you"" or ""why think about war when we can't do anything to change it"".
And I can't deal with this anymore.  I'm watching a press conference and I just can't handle this anymore.  Bush dances around questions and repeats himself and contradicts himself and acts as though he is completely right and tells us that we're fighting a war against terrorism when we're making it worse and no one understands how im feeling right now because it reads so casual and i think im having a panick attack"

"event","as some were repeated, rather than answering your questions in comments i'm doing it here.

sorry about the phonecalls...it was for effect!

to answer benu, we'll be protesting the iraq war on thursdays with the people who already do.  maybe a protest about darfur on another day.  the idea really is to protest the silence and complacency of the public BY protesting about things we care about.

about danny's comment, i agree about letters to senators. that's a really good idea.  as far as numbers go, i see no limits.  the idea is to get people excited so they'll show up. i'm hoping that we will start without the guarentee of numbers and then maybe it will grow.  

answering jeremy's and yael's comments about the possible pointlessness of protesting in a community that already agrees with your views, i have a few things to say...first of all there are a lot of people in newton that AGREE with Bush AND the war in Iraq.  the number is a minority but that isnt a problem.  the more people who agree, the more who will join the club.  the idea really is that by being there on thursdays and being vocal and annoyingly present in the community, we'll annoy some and inspire others, resulting in public stirring, even if it takes awhile.  people will start to get annoyed that we're stopping traffic and creating an eyesore/spectacle that maybe our story will make the tab and maybe eventually the globe.  the point is to raise awareness in our community AND in other communities.  we/I aim to remind people that the war (and other issues) are/is still happening.  people get so used to wars in other countries and bush being an asshole and the us government being corrupt that the really big stuff doesn't get a reaction anymore.

so it's OUR resposibility to start something big and loud that on the smallest scale will give people hope and on the largest scale uplift people to feel like we can have an impact on the government."

It is time for everyone to unite to have a voice about the atrocities committed daily by our country.  How often have you sat and complained about the administration and war and violence?  well just complaining about it and not speaking out makes YOU and ME a part of the problem.  those with strong views have the responsibility to speak out.  by remaining silent we are making it easy for the Bush administration and the bad men and women of the world to ignore us.

well that is stopping now, at least for us.  my brother and I have decided to mobilize all of our friends and others.  This school year I am starting a club to mobilize SOUTH to protest in newton center every thursday with the few men and women who have been for 2 years now.  We will get as many people to protest on thurdsays as possible, and ideally those of you at north will mobilize as well.  the goal is to have hundreds of teenagers (the ""apathetic"" faction of society) to congregate peacefully in newton center every thursday to wage vocal war on the powers that be.

anyone who wants to hop on board is totally welcome, as long as you're serious.  look out for announcements the first two weeks of school, and for the mean time tell everyone you know and get them to read this post.  

THE TIME TO HESITATE IS THROUGH."

"event","Hey Everyone.

I don't really have anything to say.  perhaps the desire to update came from somewhere sentimental, or perhaps i'm misguided.  I'm in New York visiting my sister.  I'm not in the city, I'm in upstate New York.  It's pretty different from newton, really.  One thing is that if you hold down a letter it repeats slower than if you tap the letter.  I am talking about my sister's computer which is a Mac which I am not used to.  In general around here it is definitely the country.  I experienced this hands-on by going to walmart the other day.  I didn't want to I swear!  it's just the only place that sells air conditioners around here!  And it was the most bizarre place I have ever seen.  well, that's a bit of an exaggeration which is a word i don't know how to spell, but that's a good guess, right?.  It's pretty sad because how can a small business ever survive when there exists a place like walmart.  It has absolutely everything necessary for living under one roof for so friggin cheap.  And with convenience like that, it's easy for your everyday working person to forget the poor children and adults working in terrible conditions for no money on the other end.  I mean one person is not INDIVIDUALLY contributing...the walmart is already there and the person feels helpless in doing anything about it.  so, he or she comprimises slightly his or her morals, because honestly, what is one person to do?  and that's why I felt at once guilty and justified in buying an air conditioner there.  on the one hand, it is the apathetic and/or helpless individual participation that adds up and strengthens the manipulators.  But I CAN'T do anything at this point and I NEEDED an air conditioner.  on the other hand, I alone really can't  do anything, and am I willing to sacrifice my comfort in a sweltering room just to avoid coughing up 80 dollars that won't even do anything at this point?  so basically, they've won.  with their low prices and their convenience and manipulation the evil of the world has won with walmart.  Even among the empathetic and the sympathetic and the politically and socially aware, walmart has won our souls, and someday we'll all go to hell.

I feel helpless now, just in the way that I feel helpless about George W. Bush and global warming.  Maybe I'll shape up, but it isn't looking good."

We did a tour of the park today and it was amazing. there are 3 volcanoes here, two of which were used for mount doom. it's so beautiful here.  We spent alot of time with my dad which was cool, and tomorrow we head back to Auckland.  Firday (thursday for you) we'll be on our way home.  We took TONS of pictures, which we shall promptly post with upon our return.  AAh 2 minutes and 3 !  aaahhhhh

"event","I kinda smell and I've had to pee for quite some time now.  Both of these discomforts are, admittedly, a direct result of laziness, but I assure you, It has not been thoughtless laziness.  On the contrary, I've decided that I'm turning over a new leaf.  Or rather, returning to one.  Or something.  The circumstances of my life have sent me on a downward spiral into uncomfortableness.  That is temporarily a word for the purposes of this post.  uncomfortableness in every realm of my life (well, most).  I'm not sure if anyone has noticed that I've been acting funny, or if it's just me, but it has to stop.  

so:  the time is now.  I suppose I wanted to post about this because it seems official, set in stone, a turning point.  I am through with feeling unsure around people, with feeling unsure about myself and how I look and how I communicate with the world and how I do art.  well, I'll probably continue feeling unsure about the art thing, but what can I say, I have an inferiority complex the size of Nebraska.  The size of Nebraska is escaping me right now but it sounds big when you're comparing it to an inferiority complex.

SO: LIVEJOURNAL WORLD AND BEYOND...I am determined now more than ever to be open again.  to open wide up to everything and stop being a wet blanket and start being MEMEMEMEMEMEME (me).

The End...or is it?"

normally I suppose I wouldn't post this, but the whole thing has been such an ordeal.  I thought last night that it wasn't going to happen and then got really upset and then found out this morning that it in fact was going to happen and it's only really sinking in now.  I was on the computer...the internet, AND reading live journals, so I'd say I was in a prime condition to post.  
Anyways, I am very excited.

"event","the reporters on Fox news are actually being pretty cool right now.  though i don't agree with interrupting people and attacking the guests on your show, i make an exeption, because this guy is crazy.  he wrote ""the 100 most dangerous professors"", in which he exposes ""communists"", who, according to him, are practically brainwashing their students by telling them that America is dangerous and that ""terrorists are freedom fighters"".  he talks about one guy in particular who is a political science professor.  the reporter was asking all of these questions that were really cool like ""how many communists come out of his class"" and ""so you're saying that all college professors have to be capitalist?""  the guy just said ""I don't have that information"" or ""these people are communist!"" or ""would you want a flat-earth person to teach a science class?""  and for once, the reporters on fox are really putting these people in their place.  they did it to cheney about him shooting the guy (who, it turns out, is making alot of money off of the war and so are his friends, so why is cheney socializing with him?).  cheney only talked to one reporter at all, and this reporter is a reporter for fox news.  well maybe cheney wanted him to be kind but he brought up how it sounds as if he was trying to minimalize the accident by not really reporting it.

and although i usually hate fox news, and although i disagree with their politics and their lies, it really seemed like they were doing their job.

while there are alot of things that make me sad or disappointed, i was happy with fox news for once.

"event","The new year seems rather trivial.  last week it was 2005, this week it is 2006, and it feels just like adults' love of numbers.  I think the little prince would agree.  And yet, I can't seem to help feeling that 2006 is different, is new.  and that 2005 is a year to look back on.  we are really just counting here, but the literal as well as the abstract year seems to truly have come to its end.  And so, I can't help thinking about what this year has meant to me.

My mom is better.  she's happy and healthy and strong and able to relate to me consistantly and for real.  this time last year things were at their worst. My sister has, in her way, become famous.  Jake is applying for college and fell in love with Kit, who is truly nice to have around.  And Ryan got a job that he seems very happy with.  the situation with my father is always evolving, and I somewhat worry about him.  I realized that my step brother and sister suck alot sometimes (stepsister most of the time). I went from a series of relationships that meant their somethings and nothings to falling in love with Daniel.  And I can't even begin to explain how I care for him and love him and it feels so warm to have this boy in my life.  And I know he won't leave and I always want him around, unlike many other people and most other boys that have been in my life, save Jake.  I have gone through high ups and low downs which is my way.  I lost a friend.  I gained a friend and lost her.  (though really I'm being melodramatic).  George Bush still sucks.  I have blue hair.  I am in an artistic funk.

My ties with many of you have weakened.  I feel sad about that but I think things are soon to change.

I wonder what 2006 will bring.  thinking about the drastic reversal that 2005 has brought of most everything in my life, I worry and anticipate.

Most of all, Happy 2006, everyone."

AND A BUTT LOAD OF DVDS FROM MY BOY
AND A COOL FRANK MILLER BOOK
AND MORE!

my sister printed out all of my livejournals and the comments and put it in two big binders.  it meant alot to me, but browsing them got me thinking about how I've changed within the past year.  and how unsettleing that is.  I was content with who I was once.  But now I'm a different person and I don't know her and she's serious alot of the time and boring alot of the time and she's sad sometimes.  And I wish I could own who I am and be present all the time and not feel strange socially ever and be like my brother and sister.  I feel like when I did those mushrooms I was sent on a decline.  But I have this amazing relationship with a boy who I love and would never want to be without.  so I'm confused.  All I know is that something's different about how I am with my friends and people I meet and I don't like it.  I don't think I've suddenly been changed because of the shrooms.  though I wonder what I'd be like had I never eaten them.  I wouldn't be me certainly, and I don't know whether that would be good or bad.  I always have fun with Daniel and I feel like that's perfect.  But everything else is strange and come to think of it I know whats wrong.  It's that I'm having a creative drought.  I think it's that I'm content with Daniel and neutral about everything else.  and I used to love writing silly livejournal posts and being rediculous and strange and loud and it was special to me because it was my way of connecting to the world positively.  And I hope that the me that could be strange and silly and offbeat and excited will come back more strongly.  soon.  And i don't think it's gone forever and I think that I'm just growing up.  or some shit.  so come back me!  In a new and stronger form!  please and thank you."

also, I think being emo in livejournal is okay as long as your being honest.  like, okay maybe people will think to themselves ""ew, that's such an emo post meh being emo is so annoying meh meh"".  but it's still in your brain and it's you and if people don't want to read it then they don't have to.  censoring yourself is pointless and limiting.  and that goes for everything, not just depressing thoughts.  though it is different when someone is just trying to get attention.

in other news, the president of Iran just said that ""Israelis need to be wiped off the face of the planet"".  or something in that vein.  And he could do it.  because Iran actually HAS weapons of mass destruction as apposed to a certain other country with only one letter difference that...what is that you say?... DOESN'T?.  maybe Bush thought Iraq and Iran were the same all this time and is only now going ""duuuh...WAIT! I THOUGHT WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM!  you mean Iraq and Iran are two different coutries?!  Why did they do that it's so confusing! I thought it was THE SAME PLACE.  I mean, they're both in the middle East...right?!  I mean they're all muslim terrorists!  seriously how was I supposed to know!  I never even travelled out of the U.S before I became president!  come on Dick, back me up here.  I WANT MY DADDY!!!""

I'm sure the world will be over soon.  THEN JESUS WILL COME AND SAVE THE EVANGILISTS AND BUSH WILL BE WHISKED UP TO HEAVEN IN A CHARIOT MADE OF GOLD AND BE CROWNED THE NEW JESUS.  that is my prediction.

"event","so I'm home from a weekend of family fun galore.  I had a great time...my sister and I built a sandcastle that was like 85% trenches and barracades.  it was huge.  It was called Sandia.  The people do not tire of building and rebuilding their city, and though they know it to be a losing battle with the powers that be (i.e. giant tsunamis...redundant, i know), they pride themselves on their warhorse-like attitude towards their way of life.  we left them with their defenses, knowing that it would not be enough, knowing, that they would not win but would keep up their fruitless hope until the last grain of their great city sank into the rest.  that was the night we discovered the ghost...

i was reading on the couch when i decided to turn the light on...i switched the switch and when that failed i pulled the dangly tassle and that failed so i switched the switch and it still didn't work, rendering the light, in my mind, a lost cause.  i resumed my reading with an undesired amount of darkness when i heard a loud click and looked up.  the tassle was swinging violently and i stared, startled for a moment.  i went to the switch and flipped it and the light turned on.  i told my sister and mother about how the house was haunted.  they agreed that it was strange but doubted the presence of a ghost...until...i was standing in the kitchen looking around, waiting for my sister to come out of the bathroom so that we could resume our stoned sisterly antics when a peice of paper, fastened to the wall above the dishrack caught my wandering eye.  ""liturgy of christian burial"", it said.  I was taken aback and a bit creeped out, hearing the quiet sounds of the house and the woods and the night and looking at this blatant remeniscence of a funeral ceremony.  my brain started racing.  but then i read on.  there was the name of a reverend, his birth date, the date he became a preist.  at the very bottom of this list was another date.  september 20, 2005.  ""date of death"".  I strained to remember the current date...october 8, 2005.  3 weeks.  my sister walked out of the bathroom.  ""the ghost..."".  she walked up, saw the death date and we realized how recently this man had died and how this pamphlet was the only very personal thing that these people had in their house and how there was a vase of dried roses on the windowsill.  we proceeded to freak out.  should we tell the people who own this house about how this guy was clearly haunting it?  then we heard a vibration in the wall.  ""should we tell them?...if you make a noise, we'll tell them...""  there was no noise.  ""okay, so we won't tell them about this"".  we went into the other room, sufficiently spooked and talked about the ghost.  suddenly, as if on cue, the lights dimmed and flickered subtly and the computer started to make weird whirring noises.  we decided to go to sleep.  we calmed ourselves down and proceeded to have respective amazing sleeps.  we came to the conclusion that the ghost is good-natured.  we made a ""unsolved mysteries"" movie about it and everything.  I hope the ghost isn't offended."

It happened while i was listening to architecture in helsinki, and started dancing around.  The CD ended and I immediately lunged for my ""dance music""...starting with the obvious and perfectly hokey Abba.  I then proceeded to dance around my room, jumping on the bed, and back to the floor and at that point all was lost.  I was trapped in a haze of groovin' and jivin' and I was far gone.  after Abba was a certain song by journey, and then was a little ditty by a band i like to call blind melon.  at this point i was lost...queen then rancid and I danced until I could dance no more.  I'd be lying if I said it wasn't the most fun I've had in a while.  and I definitely worked off the coolatta.

so if ever you have energy and you're alone in your room, dance around crazily to rediculously poppy music"

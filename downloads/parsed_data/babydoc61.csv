"event","i am so ready to go home. i am at the point that i just want to give up and quit, but then i don't want to do that because i will regret the things that i could have done and did not do them. i do not have a lot on my proverbable plate but it sure feel like it at times, i try keep my head up and keep pushing forward. if anyone has any advice feel free to give it to me.

thanks for all the help

"event","i am not sure why today is a bad day but it is. nobody really put me in a depressed mood but i am. i emailed all of my fathers, ron, ray, & rich asking them for some fatherly advice i have not received anything yet from them, but i sure that they will reply. 

i am to the point where i will try not to cry unless i am alone. i think that it show weakness towards my peers. i feel the tears coming now and i am trying hard to not let them fall. it is hard but i can do it. i really that kristie was with me so i could just cry on her shoulder, that would make it better i think. 

i really wish that i had a good friend on the boat like i had at sewell's point. someone like angie downing and kara lampley. they were sisters to me, they were there when i really a friend to talk to when i did not want to bother kristie with my problems, i know that if it was really bad they would have told her everything. i know that kristie is always there for me, but sometimes i just need the special person to talk to. 

i wish that christina had not moved to CT, but that was her choice. she is that one person that might get to see me cry. i really need a close friend to talk to. yeah i have friends onboard, but none that i trust to share my feelings with. 

i need the love of my loving wife so i can make love to her. i just want lay there with her and just be there with her until the day that i die....not her. she is the rock that i lean on. she has been there for me since Feb 11, 1993. that was the day that we met. even though i picked her last to dance i found it hard to resist being with her, she made me what i am today. 

i had a breakdown in 2001, she was there for me. i first went to angie, but she was there for the duration. she was the one that helped me through it. i have been with one other woman, but she does not compare to kristie. i have introduced her to robin. i think that they are friends but i am not totally convinced.

i have gotten a lot off my chest. 

thanks for listening"

"event","over the past couple of weeks has been kinda rough, i have been in the engineering spaces ""helping them"" with painting. as you know i hate painting. today was the straw that broke the camel back so to speak, this week i am in berthing cleaning it for the XO inspection at 1000. i made a bad decision today, i just went to the main spaces and not to berthing, i got my ass chewed off by HMCS, i got real upset to the point that i almost started to cry and say the hell with this and just go hide for real. i am still kind of upset about it but not as much. after dinner and after HMCS hada chance to cool off he talked to me as a man not a little kid, that is what i admire about him the most, he never dwells on my bad decisions, he discusses the problems later and that tells me that he really does care about my career, sometimes i wonder if i care about my career. i think he cares more about it than i do at times. 

i am glad that kris and christina told me about this live journal thing it really helps at times. just to vent and to get things off my chest that i really do not want to share with fellow shipmate. today was one of those days that i wished that i had someone to talk to like my friends angie downing and/or kara lampley, i needed to talk but i had nobody to talk to which did not really help. i know that kris and chirstina will read this and give their advice and opinions on how i should fix this, i appreciate them for that but sometimes i need that one special friend to talk to.

i am done venting for today. thanks for listening.

love me"

"event","Today is holiday routine, which means no real work got done....LOL. i had flight quarter all night long. i woke up at about 2pm or 1400. i helped with the bingo for the fundraiser for the tsunami victims. we raised $800. 

hags, tross, ream, and i have decided to start our plotting on HMCS tomorrow. h has gotten me twice and hags once. i came up with a weekly outline that we will go by, this way we can plan out our every move so as not to get caught. i think that he will have just as much fun receiving as we do giving....LOL. 

over the past 2+ years he has taught me alot about being a leader and a better corpsman. i will be getting my ESWS pin no later than march. i have about 80-85% of my book signed off. i will be taking the test in mid to late febuary. that is the only goal i have yet to achieve and i will achieve it. i will not leave here as a HM2 i WILL leave here as a HM2(SW). i have worked too hard to just say fuck it and not get it. i should have gotten it on the USS Simpson FFG56, it was a smaller ship this way all i would have to do is requal on a few systems and get qualified on some new systems.

well i will add more later..love me"

"event","tonight is the first new years eve that i have not been home in 12 years. i have been working in the engineering space this past week, it was ok. i had a stressful week, but being in the engine room gave me a chance to relieve some stress by needle gunning. 

i had to counsel some junior shipmates, i have only been able to counsel one of them so far. the first one started getting upset but i was talking to him with his LPO, which was a good thing. i will talk to the other one sunday with is LPO. i think that he will be angry as well. 

i hope all that read this understand where i am coming from

love bill"

"event","TODAY IT WAS A VERY BAD MORNING, IT STARTED OFF BAD, I AM NOT SURE WHY IT DID, BUT IT DID. IT DID GET BETTER THOUGH I THINK. BY THE END OF THE DAY I HAD A VERY MASSIVE HEADACHE, I HAVE FLIGHT QUARTER TONIGHT TOO.

TODAY I HAD TO COUNSEL A SHIPMATE ON HORSEPLAY AROUND THE HELO HANGER AND HE WAS NOT VERY HAPPY. I LEFT HIM WITH HIS LPO AND LET HIM DEAL WITH IT AFTER THAT. I WAS JUST LETTING HIM KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT HIS ACTIONS.

WE, AS IN MEDCIAL, CLEANED SICKBAY AND THE HEAD. HMCS BOUGHT A STEREO TODAY. 

DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE TO SAY OTHER THAN I LOVE AND MISS HER VERY MUCH. I HOPE THAT SHE READS THIS AND SEES I REALLY DO LOVE HER.

"event","HELLO EVERYONE,

this is my first entry in here. the past 2 days have been rather busy, i was put on the tiger that is assisting the engineers get ready for the MCA in March i will be working on this team for about 6-8 weeks. it has its advantages and disadvantages. i really am not complaining just venting, i think that is bullshit to have other divisions assist with thier spaces. 

kris is a little depressed with me, i have not called her but i will call her next week at least once a day. i need to hear her voice as well as me needing to hear her voice. i hope that everything goes well with the CPS. i am a little worried but i am very optimistic, so i think that everything will work out in the end. 

i am hitting the ESWS classes very hard, i want to take the test by the end of Jan or early Feb and have my board by med Feb. i will have my pin before i get back from this cruise. this way i can take the HM1 test in Sept 06. i really don't think that i will make it on the first time up but i will give it a good shot and i head up a study group at my house once a week. this way i can socialize and study at the time.


nothing else to enlighten you with.

bill"

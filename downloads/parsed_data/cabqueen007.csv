"event","I know its been a month, or maybe 2 months since I have written in my journal, and I guess its because I don't feel like it. Also, I guess because I don't get a replies that I don't write either. I would like to know what people think about what I write, even if its really bad. I feel its better to know what faults you have rather than to go on aimlessly, not knowing how people feel.

I know I get into other peoples business when I reply to other journals with my comments. Maybe I need to mind my own business. But unless people tell you, how am I supposed to know.

Ya know, my birthday is this month and I will be 51 years old. Problem is that I don't feel 51. My brain still thinks that I am 21 or around there and my body feels like 51. What a concept! My brain tells me I can still get high, and that is not good, why? Because my body isn't in any shape to use drugs in. I have a few health problems that I have to deal with, like Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure. These are not good things. Also, I have Hepatitis C, and that really screws you up. I have had a couple of Hep C attacks, and you talk about being sick, wow, I get real sick. The past 2 years I got the Flu, in February, and I was so sick that I couldn't barely move. The first time, I lost 26 pounds in 3 weeks, because I couldn't eat at all. All I did was drink water, and that came up too.

Well, no one wants to hear someone gripe about how sick they are. I don't blame them either. I still would like to get some feedback about what I write. 

I am going to start a book on the addiction to heroin and see where that takes me. I have a lot of information in my head that can be put on paper. Like how it really feels to go through withdrawal. These counselors who (think) they know what its like, but in reality they don't have a clue. Unless you have actually been there, you don't know nothing. The thoughts you have while going through it. Its so unreal.

Well, enough for now. Talk to ya later when I have more to say."

<P>I am wondering, is there any older people writing journals. If there is, please let me know. I have read quite a few journals, and the ones I have read have all been by younger people. I would like to read older peoples journals.People around my own age.</P>
<P>I feel so cranky today. My son is an asshole. He likes to say things indirectly that hurt my feelings. I am to a point that I wish him and his girlfriend would move out. Trouble is, he can't, why? Because he is too lazy to work 2 jobs and his girlfriend is lazy too. She is from Canada, but she isn't doing anything to become a citizen, or to get a green card so she can work. I hope they don't think I am going to support them for the rest of their lives. I've got news for them. I am sorry, I am just letting off steam. I am just so pissed off.</P>
<P>Thanks for listening.</P>"

"event","Hi,

I received an email that I posted a comment to today, and I read it over again, and I wanted to put the person who I posted the comment to in my friends list, but I don't know how to do that. Boy, what a dork I can be.

Anyway, I have been trying to stop using as you all know by now, and it isn't going very well. I saw my therapist last Saturday, but this time I didn't get much out of it. I was pretty disappointed. He wrote this book, and I am trying to do some more reading in it. I just feel like I am holding back, and maybe its like he said, maybe I am not really ready to stop using. I want to, but I have this war going on in my head, and it is very painful. I just feel so stupid. Here I am, 50 years young, and still using drugs. You would think that by this time, I would be into something else. I would have outgrown this nasty habit, but I haven't. The shame I feel is unbearable, and I just can't stop. I hate myself for it, and I feel like there is nothing I can do about it too. I have been over this and over this so many times that I should have stopped years ago, but it hasn't happened yet. Oh, I have stopped several times, even for a couple of years here and there, but nothing permanent. I guess I am a dope fiend and thats all there is to it.

If anybody reads this and can comment on it, please do. Age or gender or race has nothing to do with it. I want your opinion. What do I do at this stage of the game? 

Thanks for reading this and all comments will be appreciated."

"event","Today was one of those uneventful days. I live in Chicago, and for August 11th., it is pretty darn cold out there.

A couple of days ago, we bought a kitty. Who spends $350.00 on a cat? Me, I guess. Yes, its insane, but then, so am I. Oh, so what, who cares? Anyway, I also have a dog, named Skeeter, and now a cat, named Evee. A strange combination, but I think eventually they will get along. 

Yesterday, I had made up my mind not to use, and I almost made it. But about 9:30 last night, I gave in. Only because I was getting sick. This really sucks. My counselor at the clinic I attend doesn't want to give me a raise in Meth. Why? I haven't the faintest idea. But I will be seeing the doctor soon and I will discuss it with her. I am on 150mg. now, and I only want a small increase, say to 170 or 180. I know people who take 300-400 mg. a day. That is too much. Yet, these people don't use. Maybe there is something to this dose increase that I don't get.

I have been wondering. Is there any older people on here? All the journals I have read are written by our younger generation. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with that. I can appreciate and respect journals written by young people. We all have problems, whether we are 10 or 100, and the problem can all be related to each other. This is the purpose of keeping a journal. Not to mention that it is somewhere where you can put your feelings on paper, and get opinions and look them over yourself and see what you were feeling and why. And think about what you can do if you don't like what you see. So, this is life!

I am truly looking to make a friend, young or old, who cares? I need someone to talk to, and hopefully you do too."

"event","Its Monday, again, and to me its just another day. I am an addict, and I am 50 years old. Now, tell me that doesn't suck. It does, believe me.

I have been getting depressed because I am still actively using. I am tired of it. I have been an addict since I was 9 years old, and I know there is not too many people who have to say that. I hope not. 

I am looking for someone to talk to, someone who I can relate to. Age has no bearing, sex has no bearing either. Just a person with similar problems. 

Sorry, but my dog is driving me nuts to go out. I will definitely write much more tomorrow, ok? Forgive me for now. Thanks."

I am a newbie at computers and I wanted to join Live Journal so I could keep a journal of my life and how I feel each day or so. Do you know what I mean? 

So, if you would be kind enough to help me out, great!

Thank you so much.

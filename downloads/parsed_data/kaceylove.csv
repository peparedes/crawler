"event","I tend to come across as displeased with my appearance and life in general, but sometimes I have these really weird moments where i am grateful for everything I do actually have, despite how it may seem. It's the little things that when i think about i am so glad that i have some of the advantages in life that i do. I am so grateful to be able to do little things like be able to walk or take care of myself. I'm thankful that at 18 I am not living on my own trying to be an adult at far to early of an age. I haven't really had an opportunity to really enjoy my life and accomplish as much as i want, but I know that i still have those options. It sounds corny but it really is true.I think that some times I over analyze and think about  adulthood maybe just a little more than i should. I should be aware of the responsibilities ahead of me, but I shouldn't let them hold me back and worry me so much. I am just looking forward to a kitty, a puppy, me and nick in an apartment in Boston(hopefully). I have to many game plans and i need to chill out and just be 18 for once."

its ok
because its a characteristic
and not a bad one at that
everyone in the world is a bitch
even men
but on the bright side at least i dont hide it and i leave it right out there
i have also realized that i rarely feel embarrassed anymore, its just not worth it
i would like to think i act my age
some people unfortunately dont have that pleasure
some people act like they are 12 when they are 16
just spoiled, squealy, obnoxious, foul little trolls

if you have a problem being honest than thats fine
lie to everyone else but at least tell me the truth

im not scary and i wont get mad
if i am wearing a gross outfit just say ""hey that shirt is gross"" and ill be like really? ok
its not all that hard

"event","you know what really grinds my gears?
the fact that people expect you to lie and hate it when a person is actually honest
i thought everyone hated liars right? everyone expects a good person to be honest
so when im brutally honest people cant stand it
if i dont agree with someone or dont like someone its wrong for me to say something
or when i do try to keep quite about it, its like people have to bring it up and make sure to mention it
maybe just to see if i can sit still or lie
they are testing me or just want a reaction so they can be offended and then blame me for being a bitch when its stuff they wish they could say
i cant help that i am opinionated and that i know who and what i dont like
at least if im honest i can stay out of situations and stay away from people i dont like
what am i supposed to do?
sit back,and pretend like i like someone
or pretend like im happy with a situation and ignore the fact that im uncomfortable or unhappy with something
im sorry i cannot help that im not a liar or a fake(despite other peoples opinions)
im sorry if some people cannot take brutal honesty or an opinion besides their own
but if you bring something to my attention or ask me a question, chances are your going to get an honest answer
of course i engage in a white lie here and there, but i see no problem with telling to truth even if it means stepping on someones toes
so once again im sorry if i offend anyone or make anyone mad
but i do not apologize for being honest
and sorry but i probably will never stop
and if that makes me a bad person, tell me what makes a good one so maybe i can make you happy
because apparently that is what you are supposed to do
grin and bare it, because honesty is bad i guess"

i haven't even heard anyone be all excited and talk about what they are doing
is this the way its going to be in the world now?
is everyone going to boycott holidays just because they are a ""waste of money""?
how about you return your iphone, your huge ass tv, get a used car! find cheaper hobbies and settle for something that is not designer cloths or handbags instead of cutting costs by NOT eating 3 meals a day, showering daily and turning the heat on!
those are a little more important
its all the little things that make me happy about halloween
the movies, the decorations,the costumes but its like now no one wants to put the time and effort into enjoying the holidays because they are pissed off about the economy
i know it sucks but there is no need to not enjoy the little things that can make you happy and excited

"event","so i have somewhat of an idea of what i want to do
ive known for a while but i think im gunna put a little more thought into it
there is a school in Pennsylvania and its for 16 months and was created by Tom Savini who is one of the best and most well known make up artists today
he has done dawn of the dead, friday the 13th and even my favorite grindhouse!!!!
the only thing is how in the hell would i ever be able to afford to go
not to mention i doubt my mom would go for it
and there is the fact that if i decided to go this is something i have to be completely sure i want to do this for the rest of my life
not only that it would change everything for me
i wouldnt even be able to live near mass. unless i want to work at 6 flags doing who knows what
the closest i would maybe be able to live and i wouldnt even be that successful would be new york and even then new york isnt huge on movie making
i would have to live in florida if i wanted to work at a theme park(which i really dont)
or my best bet is California , obviously  
maybe even Canada but im not sure that would be something im interested in
it figures the one thing i want to do is wayyyyyyyyyy more complicated than just picking anyother collage
at least if u dont like your major you can switch out
i dont have many options if i spend all my money and go allll the way to Pennsylvania and then be like oh shit this was a baddd idea
i wish there was and easier way to go about this"

on September 2nd i had a shitty first day of collage so my mom took me out and did some stuff
we stopped by office max and i was curious to see if they had the pink sony viao i wanted and was waiting to go on sale at best buy
oddly enough it was on sale there for the same sale price at best buy
the next day we went in and bought that and all the other things we needed
on the paper saying all the features it said how it could come in pink so i asked if we could  do that
the guy said let me check and went into the computer and said that he could order it, the only thing was it would take UP TO 3 weeks to get in
i had my little heart set on it so i agreeded
2 weeks later i went in to ask a question about the router i bought and i also asked when my computer was going to come in
the fat hooker told me she had noooo clue and noone in the whole fucking store could find out where the fuck my $800 computer was
then she tried to get me to buy all the shit i already had
today my mom called and asked where my computer is (a month after)
they called my house and the man said ""that model has actually been discontinued, so we cant get that computer""
im sorry
WHAT THE FUCK
why didnt anyone call me to tell me that the fucking computer i ordered doesnt even exist anymore and if it doesnt. DONT FUCKING HAVE IT ON THE FLOOR AND TRY TO SELL IT TO PEOPLE
fucking assholes
they tried to screw me over

i visited nick and its soo cool

the only reason why i did was cause i knew it would be wayyyyy to much money to go anywhere else
i had decent grades and ive been ready to move out and live on my own since i was like 12
but nothing i could have choose to do would be worth paying off collage loans for the rest of my life
i would have to have been a doctor or a dentist or somthing that is really boring and expenise to make it worth it to spend all that money on school
so until i figure out something that it worth paying off all my life
i will just go to community collage

sleep in his uncomfortable twin sized matress
eat shitty shit ass easy mac and 2 day old left overs from the cafeteria

i dont even know how i got this way
it seemed like out of no were i turned into this gross cow
i dont get it
i wish i was just back to the way i was before
i always thought i was fat
and i guess this is just pay back for not being appreciative for how i was before
i cant stand my cloths, hair, make up, shoes nothing
i dont even want to wake up and look in the mirror because its just a reminder of how i let myself go at 17
im repulsive and i dont know what to do"

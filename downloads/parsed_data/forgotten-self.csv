"event","Well, we had our second session for our preproduction today. We finally finished 'Jessie' and it sounds FUCKING ROCKING. We switched out the acoustic and tapped in electric guitar. It sounds so much better and the drums are phenomenal. After 2 hours and a half of tweaking, editing and cleaning up the track, it came out perfect. I love Don, he is god. We still have 2 more songs to work on with him, it's gonna be a blast since he's literally such a retard, it's never boring around him. (Check him out on myspace: www.Myspace.com/donmcleodmusic)

Speaking of Don, during our session today...I got to talking about The Latency (www.myspace.com/thelatency), who are now coming out with their EP on July first, and they will be touring with Hedley all around BC (Lucky assholes). Then Don goes and says ""You know, since we're on the topic....I was wondering if it'd be ok with you two if I produced you."" And me and Maddy were like ""O.O FUCK YESPLEASE"". So now, Don of Playground productions will be producing us. He said that The Latency started somewhere like this a year ago, and look at where they are now. It's fucking killer. 

One step closer, y'know? Closer to that dream.

Moving on.....

The second song we'll be recording is gonna be about a recovering drug addict. We still haven't decided on the third song, probably something less depressing if possible. We have two serious songs, we need something more upbeat."

"event","Been awhile since my last update. Ah, I guess I'll write something.

To start it off, I shall give good news. Last wednesday was a recital for SASS (School Alliance of Student Songwriting). They hold recital at the end of every year, giving the musicians a chance to show their finished work. However, they give out three major prizes as well. The first prize every year is free recording at Mushroom Studios, one of Vancouver's biggest and prestigious studios, and a music video shoot with Amazing factory.

The night started out pretty rough for me and my friend considering that we were apparently not on the list of performers that were to perform. WE signed up, we did it twice, but we forgot to send in our lyrics to Don and Prince. So we weren't written up. Don said that we would have the chance to play if someone didn't show up. We were furious. There were judges from different label companies judging the performances, there were over 300 people watching.Luckily, 5 people didn't show up. We got a spot and played the song we wrote together: Jessie. 

The song was about a young priest, just starting out at a church, falling in love with this prostitute named Jessie who came into the church almost nightly to confess. He hates how he can't do anything to save her and how he can't show his feelings for her due to his religious standing.

I gotta tell you, I felt right at home on the stage, just like always. Everything just totally washed away: Worries, thoughts, hunger, feelings, everything except for the warm warm feeling of loving the stage. People loved the performance. Once we were done, we went backstage and we ran into these boys from the band called ""The Latency"" (check them out by the way: Www.myspace.com/thelatency). They were last years winners and now they have a record deal and will be releasing a debut album soon. They saw me perform last year and they were apparently looking forward to my performance this year. They missed my performance, so when I saw them backstage..they made me play for them, privately. I was like ""HOMGHOMGHOMGHOMGHOMG."" They said they were blown away.

Me and maddy ended up winning first prize at the end of the night. Man, it was so funny. They were handing out the prizes and well..I expected us to be third, maybe second. But when our names weren't announced, I automatically sunk back in my chair and went ""well, better luck next year."" Then I heard Don say ""First prize goes to...""Jessie"" by Audrey and Maddy."" Out of 28 musicians, the judges thought we were outstanding.

Maddy was crying, I was floating on cloud nine. Now, we're going to be recording at an awesome studio, working with THE DRUMMER FROM NICKELBACK, and will be filming a music video. I'm pretty psyched. At the end of that night though, people were coming up to me, asking for autographs, telling me how they saw me last year and that they were blown away even more with my performance this year. It was an amazing feeling. They were shaking my hand, just..wow...I felt like a rockstar. 

Needless to say, it's revived the rockstar in me. I'm determined to keep writing music, and I'm totally motivated. Especially since now I've got a band together. 

Speaking of which, for the past 2 weeks I've been sending e-mails back and forth with this guy named Ashton vale (Check him out on myspace too, he's awesome: www.myspace.com/ashtonvale. He's a musician from a band called the truegoods, coming out with an album soon. He wants to work with me and try to 'sponsor' me, or bring along to all his tours to perform. It's pretty huge.

Other bands have contacted me, wanting me to join, but due to my age..they can't bring me along. But just the idea that they even considered me is fucking awesome. I'm planning to write with a few people that I met at SASS and write with Maddy a bit more. Hopefully this'll go somewhere.

Anyhow, that's pretty much the biggest thing that's happened to me so far this month. I'm still giddy, still all ""OMGICANTBELIEVEWEWON"". I'm such a dork."

<i>7/16/1908
Dear Precious,
I am left bleeding and dying on the floor. I can feel my heart beat slowing by the minute as I ponder whether I should let go or keep fighting. Perhaps it's my imagination, my mind playing tricks on me, for I can see the face of the Angel, smirking as she looks down upon this poor, condemned soul. I'm so very tired, my Precious, so very tired of trying. What have I done wrong to deserve such treatment? To be teased and slain by the Angel herself. I asked for nothing more but affection and a kiss. Precious, are you still there? The darkness is sickening. It's burying itself into my skin, into my blood and into my mind. I can smell the scent of Hades. I do not wish to slip away, to fade and disappear. Even though the Angel has betrayed me, I am inlove. Precious, I have fallen inlove with the Angel. Forgive my mindless dribble, I think I have gone mad at last. Perhaps she is right, I had no soul to begin with. I am nothing. But I ask you this one simple request, tell her, my Precious, tell her that my heart belongs to her.

Sincerely,
Your Nothing 

10/09/1908

Dear Myself,
I have come to the conclusion that my heart is withering. What can I do to feel the affection? I'm dying, if you haven't noticed. You should take the time and think about your own happiness once in awhile, don't you think? She does care, you know she cares. Then what's missing? It's so confusing, Myself, absolutely confusing. I wish I could just go mad, maybe then I wouldn't feel anything. It's so tempting to jump over the edge, isn't it? We both want to, I know. Even if people say that we are hypocrites. Sometimes, living for yourself just isn't enough. But then again, dying for yourself shouldn't be enough either, right? Myself, I'm growing weary of always having to try and have nothing in return. Why don't I talk to her? No? Of course not, that's silly. What would I go and say? Probably something stupid. All I can do is wait, I suppose. Just wait. Patience is such a painful game though, you know how much I hate it. Oh well, I'll probably be too numb to realize that I've lost. I shall bid you goodbye for now, Myself. Please, I beg of you, take care of yourself and always think for your happiness.

Yours Truely,
Self-Awareness

10/18/1908
Dear Angel,
I'm dying, haven't you noticed? I'm almost non-existent, fading into the background where silence and emptiness lays. That's alright, the Rose has found a new happiness. You've spent all your time convincing yourself that you were an Angel, now look what you've done. You're no Angel, you're nothing more but a myth. You are something that someone made up to teach others a lesson. Don't worry though, I have sympathy for you. Have you thought about your happiness lately? I'm pretty sure you haven't really given it much thought, though you know you should. I heard that you have found a new happiness, that's fantastic! What is it like? I'm sure you have no idea. You're pathetic, Angel, so pathetic. But no more less pathetic than I am. I have learned a lesson though: What goes around, comes around. I suppose I deserve it. Yes, of course I deserve it, what am I muttering about? I find myself having trouble sleeping, having trouble breathing and keeping my mind at ease. I'll disappear, right? I will. I know it. Anyways, you try and take care as much as you can. Think about your happiness. I'm sure the Rose will be happy to know that you are.

Your Sin,
Self-conciousness. 

10/20/1908
Dear Memory,
I am the epitome of garbage. I know you would disagree, but I have lost all hopes of finding Myself again. I've spent far too long pleasing everyone around me that I have finally lost Myself. I'm still breathing, still moving, still thinking, but I fear that I cannot feel anymore. No one has noticed, I have fooled them all! Can you believe it? Day after day, people ask me for solutions. I take their demons, fight them, and hand their life back on a silver platter. But not once has anyone help me with the demons that are slowly eating me up inside. Yes, Memory, the demons have returned. They convince me that there is nothing to live for. There is simply nothing left to breathe for. I'm afraid I will never be the same. It's much like being sent to war, seeing all the bloodshed, and returning; you realize what reality really is. It takes away the warm blanket that protects you from it, and you realize that life, infact, is very cruel and very short. Sometimes I wonder if I grew up to fast. I hear the problems of those who are around me, telling me that they want to end their lives, that everything's so pointless. Empty threats and naive conclusions, that's what they are. They have no idea what reality is like, how cold it can be. It is as if they do not treasure their naivity. I would give my heart and soul to even have a glimpse of mine. Oh how I wish I could. I'm growing so very tired, but that's alright, I suppose. All my life I have lived for everyone elses pleasures. If only I can find red correctional ink to correct my mistakes. Oh, my regards to Self-Awareness and Self-Conciousness, I have not heard from them in awhile. Promise me, Memory, that if you find Myself, tell it that I miss it dearly and that I would love for it to return. I'm afraid that it has grown very cold and empty without it. Farewell, Memory, and always think about how it was and never will be.

Forever Fading,
Rememberance 

10/27/1908

Dear Rememberance,
I think I have finally stopped the bleeding. Forgive me if I have been absent for quite sometime, I truely didn't mean to leave you worried. It's just that...I had to find a way to be rid of this Emptiness before my Soul would completely disappear from this gaping wound. How did I manage to accomplish this you ask? Simple: I spoke to the Angel. Self-Conciousness was right, Rememberance, she was beautiful. Yet I could not help but notice the sadness in her voice. I don't think the Rose has returned to her yet, she is still waiting. Despite her pains though, the Angel told me to find the Lies, Truths, Secrets and Promises and speak to them, to tell them my stories. They asked me one thing in exchange for relief, just one thing: Trust. It didn't seem like such a huge price, don't you think, Rememberance? So I agreed, I gave them my Trust in exchange for relief. They cannot break it though, for when they do...the Emptiness will return and I shall bleed once more. It was a fair warning, I suppose. Memory tells me that you miss me dearly. I miss you too, Rememberance, and I long to be in the safety of your thoughts. As I was saying, I'm not quite sure how long this tourniquet will last; how long I can fight off this Emptiness. I'm afraid that it's quite persistent. But I'll try, I promise you this. Oh, before I forget, I visited Heart. Unfortunately, she is still withering, still struggling. I do hope she gets better soon. She sends her regards and what little love she has left to you. I still have awhile's journey before I find my way back, but promise me one thing Rememberance. Promise me that you will no longer blame yourself for all of this. You have never once lost me, never. I left on my own accord, and I regret leaving you so vunerable and miserable. I'll make it up to you, I swear. I shall see you soon, Rememberance. Try to speak to the Rose and tell her just how much the Angel loves her. Take care.

Always Hoping,
Myself

Dear Pulse,
I'm still very weak and ill. The antidote that the Angel had promised has not been delivered yet. The Angel said she will not be able to give it to me until she has felt Affection return into her veins. That's a very difficult task, Pulse, I see no hope for me in the future. This sickness has stricken me more than I expected, Love is such a cruel mistress. It's breached my very insides, turning them inside out to burn. I barely hear my own beat anymore. Sometimes I wonder if it has left me as well. Pathetic, don't you think? This coldness continues to swallow me and bite at my only memory of warmth. As I said, I am very weak, and I'm not quite sure how long I can continue on like this. Fooling myself that I will soon break from this plague, be saved. But we all know that isn't going to happen. The Angel herself has been pulled too far down into her own demons, losing her wings to the depressions and sins. I can hear her screams sometimes, Pulse. I'm sure you can as well if you listened very carefully. She no long sings, she no longer smiles, she now wears this mask. The flames of hell have burned her undying beauty. The only cure to her pains is Affection. The Rose still hasn't returned and the Perfect Sin has been fighting her own battles. The Perfect Sin cares for the Angel, she truely does...but she doesn't quite know just how to show it. And from all this, I suffer. The Angel's screams, Pulse, they hurt to some extent. It hastens the spread of this plague. Be rid of this curse! Please, Pulse, return to me, quickly. I cannot die. I haven't lived yet.

Forever Hoping,
Heart 

11/20/1908

Dear Myself,
I hate you with a passion. Have you seen what you've been doing to Self Control? It has lost itself in the chaos created by your homecoming. You promised Rememberance that you would return, you promised and said you would. You're nothing but a liar, a cheater and a sick twisted sodomite. New pains continue to shoot through our world because of your lies, new self inflicted wounds have returned. It's been constant, Myself. Imagine, constant pain that'll remind us that you are a failure. Why would you put us through this punishment? Now Self Control will die and kill us with it. It has no fear of doing so. Death would be so much better than insanity, don't you think? I'm afraid that we are on the brink of that. Though the self inflicted pain is horrible, it continues to relief us of this sudden loss of sanity. It allows us to remember how to breathe, how to live, that we're alive. Quite pathetic, really. Sick and pathetic. I hope you are happy, Myself. The Angel still weeps and cries for her Rose but we are quite sure that the Rose will never return. However, The Angel will soon die as well, so there's no need to worry. Sometimes I do wish that you never existed. All you do is cause pain to those around you. Why can't you provide little happiness for us, Myself? Is it too much to ask for? Though this letter contains my rotting insides, I do wish for you to return. End this pain, please. Too much blood has been shed.

But apparently, since everyone's stating their own HONEST to god blogs about things they do everyday
I'm going to go ahead, join the majority, and BITCH about it.

I'm friends with a ton of stoners even though I don't do drugs myself
But at the same time, I'm friends with a lot of wannabe-stoners
That would shove a joint up their ass
If it was cool to do so
It's easy to differentiate one from the other, really

For one, stoners, they do it for themselves, for self enjoyment with friends
However, my observation has caused me to come to the conclusion
That most of these stoners DO NOT advertise that they do it
If you ask them if they're stoned because they're acting funny
They answer you honestly (most of the time)
They don't come RUNNING in the damn FUCKING school
screaming ""GUESS WHAT I JUST HAD OUTSIDE.""
or ""HAHAHAHAHA, I CAN SEE PRETTY COLOURS""

You know how when you can just TELL when someone's trying that hard?
Yeah, that's the vibe I get from those people.
Like fuck
You pop E, DONT JUST RANDOMLY TELL PEOPLE
""Hurr hurr, I took E and had an adventure.""
retard.


Same goes for drinking
Don't say shit like ""oh, I stopped having fun after I started getting sober.""
No one gives a fuck, it makes you sound like an alcoholic
Say ""yeah, it was fun."" That's sufficient enough
Christ, it's NOT fucking COOL to do all this shit
The more you try to be COOL
The more you're going to look like a retard

A lot of people drink, do drugs, party all night long
They wake up the next morning and talk about it
Not tattoo it on their ass and wave it around like a trophy

I don't care if you drink
I don't care if you like to fuck donkeys

"event","I always used to ask myself how I'd react if someone in my family died. I imagined myself crying, being upset, then getting over it after two or three days. I thought I'd be fine. I'm the type of person who could control their emotions fairly well, or atleast get over things quickly. It's safe to say that I'm not always right though, thus why I feel like crap right now.

I recieved a phone call yesterday from my mom. My dad was shot, roughly 3 pm (12 am our time) infront of their house. My mother was in the shower when she heard the gun shots and my eight year old brother heard it as well. My dad is dead. I didn't really know how to react to it, I still don't. I was crying all day yesterday, not knowing why. I didn't feel sadness nor did I feel anything. I felt confused. My mom's words kept ringing in my head: ""Dad's gone, Allen. He's gone."" Yet I keep asking myself if he's really gone. Is it really possible that he's gone? I woke up this morning feeling nothing. Absolute nothing. I had a heavy feeling in my heart, the ones  where you just wanna tear your chest open and fix it. I've repressed my feelings, as much as I promised myself I wouldn't. I didn't want to cry anymore, I didn't want to think about it anymore. Needless to say, I had a mental breakdown after school. I didn't want to accept that he was gone...but I had to, and I had to let it out. He's gone. He's really really gone. 

I know I didn't get along with him as well as I should've. I didn't appreciate him either. But I know that he was trying to fix things up and I know that he was trying to change. I wasn't the greatest daughter in the world, and I regret never telling him that I loved him. He was a good man, a good friend, a good son and a good father. He will always be remembered as the giant Bear that is my dad. I really didn't expect him to die this way....I really didn't, but life likes to kick us in the ovaries like that. I hope he's fine wherever he is. Rest in peace, Dad. We love you.

"event","Today, I realized how low the generation of teens have gone. What a surprise that they have turned into drunk, idiotic, hormone driven junkies. It's like walking through a zoo, really, but instead of having the sign say ""Do not feed the animals"" it's a giant neon billboard saying ""Do not hit Cuntfaced ass-mongers. They've suffered enough."" They seem to have this mentality where idiocy means being cool, sure whatever...they can think what they want. But throw me in that equation? Teen+Idiocy+Me=PAINANGERGETBUMRAPEDBYAFATGUY. From some dude groping your ass to mistaking you for a hooker, here's my share of the story.

I was on the bus with my girlfriend and her friend, having a good time, laughing. Then came the exotic breed of chimpanzee's that were dropped on their heads called cuntfaced ass-mongers. They came in a pack of three, wearing that ugly puffy skin of theirs. Little do they know that it makes them look fat. So they sat down dangerously close to us and we did the one thing that we needed to do: Ignore them. They made some comments about a big party and nice butts and big boobs and some guy named james, though i don't know how that all adds up to something other than assuming that they're talking about a transsexual named james that has a nice butt and big boobs who they met in a party. I don't know, nor do I really wanna know. We continued to mind our own business when all of the sudden, one of the cuntfaces asked my girlfriend if it was ok to sit beside her. I was confused, though alert, and paid special attention to how he was grinning at his friend before taking a seat beside us. It was like watching micheal jackson baiting kids into Neverland with rock 'em,'sock'em robots. I grew tense, specially when he started to talk to my girlfriend. No, sorry. Not talking, more like making me want to shove a ten foot pole up his ass....that and stick a breath mint in his mouth. What's wrong with you guys?! Do you know what a TOOTHBRUSH is?!


He continued to make rude comments with that smug grin. I sat, said nothing and looked out the window as my two companies did the same. He kept chuckling at his fellow chimpanzee's, who looked like they were the coolest in the world for having one of their buddies harass two girls. Oh yes, so very manly. Then I turned my head to look at him. I stared and stared and he stared back, still smirking. I could hear the words ""I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt shirt, too sexy it hurts"" going through his head. I looked away after awhile, I didn't want his assmonger zit face burned into my retinas. He stopped for a bit...and then continued. Ever had that craving to slug someone but had to hold it in due to the fact that you didn't want to make a scene? Yeah. It's. Fucking Grand.

Needless to say, they did stop after awhile. They sensed that their sad attempt to impress civilization has failed. So what did they do? They took out the alchohol. Also known as magic juice, the thing to make the room spin and the first step to waking up beside a chick named Pedro. They waved it around like a trophy. ""Hurr hurr, I'm gonna get shit faced. Hurr hurr."" Productive, very productive.

The thing is, these guys think its absolutely cool to do something like that. And honestly? The cool meter is crying. CRYING! That's cold hearted, man. Really uncool. My suggestion boys? Take off your fat man jackets, buy a toothbrush, hug your mothers and go find James the Tranny at the party. Tell him to stop calling (minor burn right there. OH TOTALLY OWNED). Maybe I should've told them off...or maybe I should've called the SPCA and informed them about their retard breeds on the loose. Either ways, it just comes to show that humans are not evolving, but regressing to our caveman instincts where degrading other people is cool and strange, foul smelling liquid is a trophy."

"event","The lines ""I'm 60% lesbian and 40% bisexual"" caught my eyes as I came a across a random page. There are...so many...errors in that one statistic...that I could break down like a child discovering that santa clause is really your dad in a fat man suit. It hurts to think about it...but I must share my pain and ask you: Please, enlighten me on this issue. Everyone enjoys their sexuality. I for one, enjoy groping boobs and admiring the female physique. But I can openly say that I am 100% lesbian. Not a bit of lesbionicism, not a bit of straightism or a bit of bisexualism. I am not a BITSA (Def:Being a bit of everything. Found in the almighty dictionary of Audrey. AKA handbook for special needs). It's one or the other. These things end up confusing a lot of people, that's like saying ""I like icecream that isn't cold."" Or ""Let's have sex with clothes on."" or ""I like math.""

I understand being curious and managing to just sort of think that you're a lesbian...but then realize that the chick that you've been fantasizing about turns out to be that dude that has more curves than you. Either ways, ONE OR THE OTHER. Let's not be greedy now. Please, again, I ask you...enlighten me. To test if you are one or the other...please follow the easy-to-read-for-stupids, or in l33t speak, the wall of text that I can't understand, steps to step away from being a bitsa. (These steps are not proven, please refrain from suing me or egging my house. Thank you.)

1.Look at a penis. If the first thought that comes to mind is ""slug""...well..that's self explanatory.
2.Boobs are great. Agree or agree. <.<...>.>
3.Listen to the backstreet boys.Results might vary.
4.Audrey is great.
5.Sit and watch the L word. Results should vary.
6.You think Audrey is great.
7.Female curves are better than the others, agree or disagree.

My main point? You can't be a lesbian and a bisexual at the same time, or straight and gay at the same time. They contradict each other. When you're a bisexual, you lean towards a certain sexuality depending on who you're dating. If you date a chick, you may lean into being a lesbian. If you date a guy, you'll lean into being straight but still find interest in women and vice versa. If you feel that way, then yeah..you're a bisexual in denial. Not because you don't wanna admit you like girls, but because maybe you've been gay for such a long time that you're scared to admit that you like the opposite sex. My rant if over, methinks. Yush, I shall leave you to bitch about how pointless this entry was."

Otherwise known as the day of terror, broken condoms and an excuse for sluts to dress up. Makes me wonder what the generation of children have come to. Next thing we'll be seeing are pregnant little Briney Spears juniors, we all know how terrifying that is. That's worse than seeing a fat woman in a bikini on the beach, wondering why she was wearing a thong and later finding out that it wasn't a thong at all; it was just her ass devouring her bikini bottom. I've already seen 9 year olds wearing skirts and cleavage popping shirts. For the record my dear readers, DO NOT SHOW ANYTHING UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO FLAUNT. What the hell are those prostitots trying to show? Mosquito bites?

Pedophiles will increase by number, I mean...c'mon. All the whores, strippers and hookers will lose their jobs! THINK ABOUT THE HOOKERS! STD's will become as natural as puberty and bithcontrol pills will be known as a vitamin. You'll be in a grocery store looking at a can of peas that have the words ""10 times the amount of birth control now!"" On it. We'll have some kind of herpes HIV crabs syphilis=Shciv. Sounds sexy and foreign, no? For the boys though? I think it's wayyy tougher. By the time they're 11 they'll have 5 kids in one hand..and a prescription of viagra in the other. 

So when baby strollers become an accessory, remember my good readers.........chocolate...is good....
....Sorry, I meant: If we don't change the way the children are heading, we are all literally...screwed over. Fucked sideways. Up the-.....ANYWAYS. Let's keep out self respect and hormones in check, little kiddies of the future. Sex is good, but we still need some moderation, no?"

"event","I think everyone's heard about the new rule that's going about in our airports. Apparently, we're not allowed to carry anything liquid or any gels because of the liquid bomb threat/rumor that's happening. So I'm wondering, who did Bush sleep with this time to issue this IN CANADA. It's a known fact that canada is like toast, neutral toast. No one would ever bomb us because everyone loves neutral toast. If you look back to how the airports were 10 years ago and compare them to now, it's amazing how much it's changed. First it was no pointy objects in the plane. I can see the first man ever having a boner on the plane as a reaction then ten minutes later he's being arrested for having a 'knife' in his pants. Come to think of it, if the terrorists used their crotch as some kind of threat, the US would issue some retarded rule like 'No penis on flights.' 

Then there was that rule where they had to search carry ons/luggage for bombs. It's perfectly reasonable, but you can't help but think that there's that one security guard that won't be able to resist those lacy undergarments and just sniff 'em. And when you catch them they snap back with a 'Oh, just checking them for drugs.' At this point you're thinking 'Dude, if you saw white stuff on my undergarment, sure as hell isn't cocaine.' That is why you should ALWAYS watch them when they search your luggage. Those security guards can get pretty damn tricky. Then there's that rule where they search you for sharp objects and feel you up. That must've been like..some kind of raise for the guards I swear. Coming home with stories like 'I found a 3 incher today.' or 'Wow, those boobs were so fake'. Though if a person was planning to stuff a knife or something sharp somewhere near their crotch or boobs, I do pity them if sombody accidentally backs up into them..next thing you know there's a pool of blood forming around you and you realize that you have been de-boobed or neutured.

I swear the next rule that will be coming out will be something like 'no clothes permitted on flights. Everyone must proceed naked.' If that happens, it's either Bush is desperate for some nudity or he's just that paranoid. We'll have our pedo's wandering around with their camera's, taking pictures, it'll be glorious. And by that time, terrorists will probably figure some way to smuggle those weapons in, probably using secret pockets in their skin flaps or stuffing them between their buttcheeks or maybe regurgitating millions of nano bombs and freaking out everyone; boobs will jiggling everwhere, wangs swinging back and forth. It'd make reaching for your luggage in those holds above the seats a little awkward. Considering when you reach for them, the person in the aisle seat has your crotch right in their face. And for the little kids, it's like....sex ed for free! Next thing you know there's going to be a porno called 'PPGW' Plane Passengers Gone Wild.

I'm afraid, dear readers, that our airports are one step away from being a nudist colony...or a hang out for pedophiles. It'll turn us into some low self-esteem retards, comparing ourselves to other peoples naked body parts. So for those with 'unfortunate' body parts, prepare yourselves for the inevitability.

p.s I do understand why there are rules like those issued, but I'm just trying to see the lighter side of them."

"event","Okies, I think we can all agree that some ex's tend to be a little crazy after the break-up. Well, ok..maybe not some, maybe A LOT of ex's tend to act this way. Wether you are the the heart breaker or if it is your heart being broken, normally both people act like the other has really bad B.O. Makes you wonder if you actually do...or if they really are trying to keep their distance from you. But of course, the signs of a creepy ex begins with something so innocent. Wether it be a phone call, an attempt to hang out or a friendly comment on a internet page, there is ALWAYS something that will branch out from that. Once you've let it branch, no matter how many times you try to escape them, they will always keep coming at you like a horde of fat women after a cake. 

In some cases they will try some kind of suicide attempt note/e-mail/phone call. It will always start with an ""Oh god! I can't live without you!"" Or something along those lines. Do not panic. If you're intelligent you will notice that it is a trap. DON'T EVER FALL FOR IT. If you do...then you've proven to yourself that you're a sucker. Once it works, it will always work, and will forever work against you. You might as well staple yourself to their underwear because everytime you try to tug away..you'll tear something very valuable, probably your pride and self respect because you'll just keep coming back to them. There are very few cases where the person will kill themself, and if they do...Hey! It wasn't your fault. What you can do though in a situation like this is to TRY to support them in some way. If you do decide to call their bluff though, it's normal to feel guilty right after. But rest assure, 90% of the time you'll see them the next day, their face pressed against your window and watching your every move ((Not that I've done that to anyone before *note the sarcasm please*)) This is a very famous tactic, dear readers, and sometimes it does work. So beware.

Another tactic that creepy ex's use is the ""Let's hang out as friends"". This starts with an invitation. They will act buddy buddy with you on the phone and apologize, claiming it was their fault as to why the break-up even happened. So, ok, you start thinking 'Hm, alright. That makes me feel a little better.' Then they ask you to hang out, just as friends of course. When this happens, the first thing you do is ask if anyone else is going to be there. Now, if they are really sincere about 'hanging out as friends' there will be atleast another friend there. But most likely, they'll lie to you on the phone and make up some excuse when you get there, discovering that you will be spending the evening alone with them. By that time you should be thinking to yourself 'oh fuck'. There is only one essential thing that you MUST remember in a time like this: WATCH THEIR HANDS. Whatever you do, do not EVER let your eyes stray away from their hands. The moment you do, the next words that will be coming out of your mouth will be ""What are you doing?"" Or ""Dear god, stop that."" Be sure to stop them or things will just get worse and worse, they'll come onto you faster than a horny lesbian discovering a tied up Jessica Alba in their bedroom. If they continue their approach, either talk to them and tell them to stop or simply leave. After that 'hang-out' though, I hope that you've learned your lesson enough and never ever do that again.

I'm sure everyone's gone through some of these things or maybe something worse like...waking up one morning to discover your underwear missing from your laundry or mysterious footsteps following you wherever you went, either way...they all scare us in the end. But it teaches us a very, VERY, valuable lesson...what it is, I don't know. So my conclusion? Ex's can be a bit extreme. So, readers, keep your underwear close and your ex's far away."

"event","Ok, so I just started to notice really really creepy things about my family. It's amazing how retarded they are actually. Let's see...I guess I'll start with my father. He's been getting spa treatments which made me think that he's actually girlier that he acts. God knows no spa treatment could fix the way he looks. But that didn't really disturb me much. What disturbed me...was the fact that he goes to a high class WHORE HOUSE. When my aunt told me this...I felt sick, really really sick. He's like....40 or something, WHY A WHORE HOUSE?! I'm not sure if I should pity my mom for discovering where their money's been going too or if I should feel sorry for the whore's dancing for my father. Anyways, that left me feeling...""colourful"". 

Next is how my uncle has a weird habit of leaving clips that he watches on the winamp playlist. Normally the playlist would have well...my playlist on it. Muisc and such. But everytime I come home after being out with the guys or whenever we leave the house and no one's left here besides my uncle, I always come back to find that my saved playlist is gone and I see colourful titles. I think what killed my eyes the most was the title ""Bigcock""...yeah...made me question what type he watches. But EVERYTIME this happens, I always try to ignore it the best I can and just put my playlist on there...and act like nothing ever happened. 

The BIGGEST one that's been bothering me is my grandma. Yes, my grandma, the little 74 year old lady that putters around. Every friday night and saturday night, there's these..specific channels that show shows that kids aren't supposed to watch. And I normally don't go up to bed till around 12. Everytime during friday and saturday nights, I see my grandma infront of the tv watching these channels and my god..I swear I could've gouged my eyes out. Not because of the show...I really don't care about it, but because IT'S MY GRADMA watching this. And she's sitting there like...it nothing, but it's still creepy how she knows what time and at what channel and CONSTANTLY watches them. Hell, I caught her watching GGW. Today, while me and my cousin were painting the deck, I saw her watching the ""Button"" Music video by the pussycat dolls. I mean..when I watch it, I go into a weird 'shhh, I'm watching' state, but that's me. So when I saw her watching it, I'm like ""okies, so maybe she's flicking through the channels."" But she wasn't flicking through, she was watching intently. Watching these 6 highly attractive women in the video who were dancing like strippers...and it just seemed...a ""little"" weird to me. 

At this rate, I might as well come out and tell them 'Hey, I'm attracted to women.' because it's not disturbing compared to the stuff I've learned. But then I guess old people need lovin' too. I don't really care...as long as they go do a good job of keeping it a secret. I don't think anyone would be pleased when they find their parents secret porno stash or happy time toys. Anywho, my rant shall stop. Now that you've read this...the images shall forever haunt your imagination."

I'm slowly getting better at the guitar, which is a good thing I guess. My parents are still being pains, specially my mom....jeez, she's acting like a seven year old. But yes, my life has been.....eh lately. Mood swings have been happening, kinda weird...but yes. Teacher's have been stacking work after work on students after the damn strike it's not even funny >.<. 

I haven't written a decent poem in months, and I feel kinda down about that too. It's funny though, usually in the kind of modd I've been in, I should be able to pull a poem out of my ass. But I'm not sure, it just isn't coming to me yet. Maybe tomorrow or something. Or maybe I need more motivation...DAMN IT PEOPLE! MAKE ME DEPRESSED XD! But I've been hiding my mood swings pretty well, it's just that fact that one single thing could put me off. I could be really happy and then really sad, it's really annoying actually. Anyways....I'll leave you guys here. Hugglez and cuddlez, laterz."

My parents are still kinda whining at me about things, but eh...my aunt and uncle are still contemplating about the whole trip on christmas and all that. To tell the truth, I seriously don't wanna spend my christmas and my new years with my father. The two holidays I look forwards to will be hell this year *Cries* But the good news is..my birthday's coming up in three days and my dad is sucking up to me. He seems to have this crazy idea that he can gain my trust back by giving me more and more money. But little does he know....I will point and laugh in his face *Grins*. 

School's been...interesting. Less fights, less stupidness...more retardations^^. I won the poetry contest again...""Editors choice"" award once again, woot. I'm slowly beginning to think that the whole thing is a stupid bloody scam. Oh well, my poetry is crap anyways. Here's one:

WINTER

Once upon a winter day
I stood outside all alone
My broken dreams
Drifted away with the cold breeze
As the air brushed against me
My body grew numb,
I grew weary

My feet touched a doorstep
I looked up upon it
A door stood before me
I knocked once, twice
Hoping to find warmth from the cold
No one answered

I stayed for moments later
As I remained there, I grew colder
Till this day I remain by that door
And forever will be waiting by this door
Forever will be alone in the winter cold
Forever will be numb
Until this door that stands before me
Opens

I shall leave you all here, wootness. Hugglez and cuddlez, laterz."

"event","Holy crap it's been awhile since my last update. Anywho....things have been going..ok I guess. My parents are my main thing right now, they are being a total pain in the ars. Here's the deal, they are starting to get pissed off at me because I don't call them everyday and I don't send e-mails. Now, here's my side: I' can't call them since I don't have cash to spare to buy a phone card. Whenever I do, no one is at home to buy a phone card. I send then e-mails three times a week, they shouldn't be bitching at me. I can't write down every single thing I do every fucking day since I hang around the guys, and they don't like me hanging with the guys. And now, they are trying to get me to go back in that godforsaken country for a ""vacation"" Which will actually turn out to be a trap and they WILL keep me there. My mom told my aunt that, she said that if I go there...they'll keep me there because apparently I'm changing too much. What the hell do they want me to be? Did they expect me to be a normal kid after the shit they put me through. I've grown up mom...deal with it. I've changed the way I dressed because I felt like it, no connection there. I have a more mature mind because of them....all those yelling and beatings are finally paying off dad, thanks. 

I've grown up, they can't deal with it. They still want me to be under their thumb, oblivious and innocent. They want me to be that sheltered little girl I was two years ago. No friend, just them to hang around with. That's too bad for them....I'm not going back there. Chances are, if I go back there...I'll either run away or start rebelling against them. Do drugs to piss them off, skip classes and/or kill my dad. I cannot stand to be around him, if I do...I will have the urge to strangle him, cut off his tongue and his doodle, evicerate him and hang him with his own entrails. Then use him as a shooting target with his own fucking gun....see how he likes having a gun pointed at him. Wait....no...I think I'll beat him first, let him suffer every pain that I suffered. Starve him, hit him, point his gun and whip him with it. Then I'll kill him...*maniacal laughter* Erm...yes....you probably think I'm crazy now.....damn straight! Nah, I just tend to get like that when I talk about my father. Anyways...I'll stop my rantings. Laterz."

"event","It's amazing how things change so fast. How many things could happen just within a day, and how many things could be confessed as well. I entered an International poetry contest just for fun, only to recieve a leeter saying that I have been accepted in the semi-finals. I was so happy, but then I realized that getting into the finals is something that will never happen. I mean c'mon. There are alot of really good poets out there, I highly doubt I would win. 

Well my band is gone now, 4 people quite on me. It's hopeless, all I wanted was to play music but I guess that'll never happen. There's been alot of problems between me and a couple of friends. And jeff seems to be rapidly changing now. Weird huh? But surprisingly he's not maturing, he's turning more different than that. I know you're gonna be reading this Jeff, no offence. But I'm just saying the truth, if you don't straighten up, things are gonna just blow up in your face, just a friendly advice.

I have alot of things on my mind, debating to myself what I should do. My feelings are still mixed up inside, all I really have to cheer me up is Nick and my other friends. Cathy has been really weird lately, but what's new about that?

I guess some things are meant to change and some things are meant to just stay the same. But some people don't realize that, when a person changes you have grown to know the old tehm that their change to you is rather shocking and uncomfortable. The only thing left to do is to change yourself. Maybe I'm just blabbing off, and chances are this entry does not make sense. But whatever I really don't care anymore."

"event","Well, yesterday Cat was crying on the phone because I told her something. My fault again why a friend cried, dammit why do I always mess everything up? Sigh....anyways, hearing her cry made me want to cry. It somehow made me worried about her. I guess it's because I hate hearing or seeing my friends cry, specially Cat. She's so different, like...I dunno, it's just hard to explain. Me and her, we don't classify ourselves as best friends but just close friends.

I decided to buy a bouguet of flowers for her today, as a sorry for yesterday. I really hope it worked, but when I gave it to her... she liked them...but I'm not sure if she was shy or something, but she didn't say ""it's okay"" or ""thank you"". I wasn't expecting her to, but I was kind of wondering why. But yeah. Today was very, meh. It was so weird, I just had a really weird feeling. Maybe it was because I wasn't hanging with Cat.

She was hanging with Rachel and all those girlie girls. It's funny because the first things out of my mouth were ""Oh my god, I've lost her to the dark side.....MY GOD WE'VE LOST CATHY TO THE DARK SIDE!"" One of my friends came up to me and said ""Why don't you and Cathy hang-out anymore?"" My reply.....was ""I'm not sure myself"" It bothers me....I seem to have developed a fear, a fear of losing her as a friend. Maybe I'm just jealous, I'm not sure anymore.

She's been really distant lately.The funny thing is, Cat was my turniquet.The only person who was basically stopping me from doing stupid things. Now that she's barely around me, I tend to get in more fights and stuff, I start to bleed again.I know I'm probably over-reacting, but whatever. I have a really big feeling that, I'm gonna lose Cat as a friend....and I'm scared.

I guess me and her are just growing up and figuring out that we are too different. I know I sound kind of selfish and stuff, but I'm not stopping her from being friends with Rachel and all them. I'm just saying what I feel."

"event","Well yeah, last day....er night I have here in Japan, I feel sad. We went to the school where my cousin works. It`s an all girl school, it was so cool!The school was huge...OMG i mean HUGE!!!!!! The theater itself was big enough. I love that school...I didn`t even wanna leave. All the girls saw us walking in the halls and there were all staring and  giggling. Apparently they thought I was adorable and cute. I watched the dancing club, they were awesome. There were so many sports in that school it wasn`t funny. It was like my heaven! The baseball team were cool, they thought we were awesome. Oh yeah, by the way... this school in junior highschool to college.

I didn`t wanna leave the school. I had a hard enough time trying to stop my urge to run around the track they had on he campus and run into the gym where they were having a basketball practice. I wanted to see the basketball team actually, but we didn`t have enough time *cries*

Well me and grog are leaving tomorrow. I miss the guys...I hope they feel the same way too though. I was talking to Cat on MSN today....it was so weird, but at the same time I felt uplifted. It was nice to talk to Cat again....the weirdness was back. Well the guys back home, they sound like they`re having alot of fun......it almost sounds like they don`t even miss us.....oh well.....

Me and grog feel kinda out of the loop now. It probably wouldn`t feel the same when we hang out with them. They would be talking about stuff and we wouldn`t know what they are talkin` about. see I would say me and grog could do the same thing...but at the same time, what do we have to say about what we did here in Japan? sure we`ve done some pretty awesome stuff, but it`s stuff that is family kind of deal. So in reality I guess you can say...We`re...well atleast I`m gonna feel out of place.

This is the reason why I told jeff that I didn`t wanna know what they are gonna be doing while we`re gone....because to tell the truth, it sometimes angers me. I mean, we`ve missed so much. If I didn`t have school back there in Canada...I wouldn`t really come back, I would atleast stay here for a bit longer. Sure I would miss the guys...but I`m sure after a while they would forget about me. I know I sound so emotional, but I`m just writing what I`m feeling. 

Well I don`t really have a choice now do I, but to go home. I guess we`ll just have to see how this will work, and how things will turn out to be. I guess some things are meant to change, and I guess...these past two weeks has changed alot. Now I know what my uncle meant when he said that we would see things differently when we go to Japan. This trip made me realize...that we are not really needed at home."

"event","Yes..I know that word makes no sense, but it's a word me and my friends use.... so don't you dare steal it or else!*ahem* welcome to another episode of Allen's whining and such and such. Well today started out awesome. I got to play DDR infront of a couple, well a good 30 or 50 students in the school on a big screen. So it was all good. On Tuesday I'm leaving for Japan....Whoohoo!well...yeah. I'm gonna be missing 5 tests....5 fucking tests in school!!!! FUCK!!!! sigh...oh well.....craptacular it is...so craptacular.Anyways, I got home...I was all alone. Then my cousin came home, he was apparently ""pissed"" meh what's new about that? So he was pissed at Jeff again... what a fucking surprise. He talked to us again.. gave us a lecture, I understand why he does this. He probably thinks I don't,but he can believe whatever he wants, I have a clean conscience. so they can all fuck themselves over for what I care. Then my Aunt made a huge deal about me coming downstairs where all my friends where sleeping over at 4:00 in the morning, I did that because:
1.I couldn't get to sleep
2.I sort of have this problem about freaking out and panicking when I can't get back to sleep
3.I needed to calm down so I came downstairs where my friends were still awake, well on a some what degree.

So yeah, my aunt was all like ""oh you're going out with Jeff again aren't you?"" For fucks sake,give it a rest, just leave me alone in my little stooper. Can't i just be happy for once? just y'know, be normal and just like not be so bloody under the pressure of people not trusting me and watching me and stuff.There...I'm done, yes yes I know I whine too much, you don't like it? you all can just bite me."

Anyways next tue.we're leaving for Japan,I'm happy...and scared at the same time.Well not so much scared...just I dunno.....unsure I guess.I'm just gonna miss a couple of people...and stuff.Today wasn't actually that bad if you sum it up,besides the fact I have to carry this secret of mine until I'm sure the person I'm gonna tell is trustworthy.(not:No I am not pregnant...idiots) so yeah....I guess,these are one of those rare nice and peaceful days.I'm done my rantings for now.....yes...for now *shifty eyes*"

"event","Well hello again....welcome to another page of my really weird up life.Well yesterday was okay I guess..the night before that though wasn't. My friend....was mad at me,and man....did it really bother me. I don't want to get too much into it,I just did something really stupid that ended up being a disaster and making her hate me and make me hate myself.Sigh...seems like I can't do anything right,I guess I'm just really good at screwing up.Anyways,I had this discussion with my family about suicide,well it was more of a debate that took a turn and changed into a war.Anyways,it all started when I read this book.The name of the book was ""Suicide:teens talk to teens"" and it was about why and how teens do suicide or try suicide.But yeah,it really caught my attention so I wanted to know what my family thought of suicide.And they said it just some mental disorder.perhaps it is...but to me it isn't. So we kept on debating about this and stuff until everything just took a turn for the worse,it ended up that my folks thinking that I think suicide is good and I'm suicidal. God,do they want me to be?I have a hard enough time accepting life the way it is,all I wanted was a nice,calm discussion about the topic....I guess that's really impossible to happen. I had suicidal tendencies,maybe I still do...but hey,I'm still alive aren't I?Sometimes I think ""If I want to kill myself,which way should I do it?maybe I can just overdose myself...that sounds less painless,but then I will have to vomit a hell of alot.Maybe cutting myself wouldn't be so bad,the only thing that would hurt would be when the knife cuts my wrist...then slowly I'll pass out and die.that doesn't sound so bad.""I plan of how I want to kill myself,and to me I think that's a bad sign.See the thing is..I can't talk to anyone about those tendencies of mine,because they'll think I'm just a young girl who really doesn't know what I want,then they'll start comparing their problems with mine...insisting that they have bigger problems and that my problems are stupid and I should just get over it.I hate it when that happens,it's people like them that make other people kill themselves...they have to learn how to listen.Suicidal people are calling for help...they are not whining.Doesn't matter how big or how small their problem is,or if you have a bigger problem than them...the point is they want to kill themselves and saying that you have bigger problems or that you've been through what they are going through doesn't help.They don't care about that,as a matter of fact that only makes them feel bad about themselves even more,because you're implying that they are whiny and stupid for thinking that they have a problem they want to kill themselves for when you have a bigger one and you're dealing with it fine.People are different,some people can't take stress too much.Some people just want to talk....ask for help.But if people keep on pushing them away or putting them down,these suicidal tendencies will happen one way or the other."

So yeah.Then after media tomorrow,Scotty will probably pick a fight with me again.Which really is getting annoying because he always loses and it's getting repetative.

It really sucked.I was bored 2 nights ago...actually i had a pretty crappy night 2 nights ago..but i don't wanna talk about it.So i wrote this poem..just for that fucked up night:

I teared
I whimpered
My heart now numb
My body nearly lifeless
As blood slowly left me
My cuts deepened
Death was approaching
Darkness will soon arrive
To end my life
To end the pain
To bring me happiness once again."

But no my other friens wanted to know.Ashlee told him that she hasn't shved in about a week and that if u go down to her private place it's like an amazon.Then yesterday she told him  that her bf masdurbates to hentei.WTF? do i really need to know these things? and why the hell is she telling him if  he goes down there it's like an amazon? I mean really. I was pissed, really pissed. He makes a joke out of everything, it pisses the hell out of me. I was disturbed to no end, fuck i hate it.

Sure everything will be happy again and everyone will be happy-go lucky, but will i be the same?will i be happier? will i see them the same?I don't think so, my bf is probably in their eyes nothing more but a stupid idiot who likes a young girl. But in my eyes he is everything to me right now,My family in the philippines is bloddy messed up. My brother has lung problems, my mother is going suicidal because of my dad, and my dad is fucking cheating on my mother.That's enough stress right? here my family is great and all but they don't understand me...they just don't. My only happiness is probably my friends and my bf. And i will not let them take that away from me.7 years of my life was hell, my dad was abusive my mom was getting beaten up i needed to protect her and my brother from my fucked up father.I took all the beatings i was traumatized...i never had any close friends. Now that i have people who actually care about me and i have a person who i love and loves me back...I am not letting go. If they try to pull something and try to stop me and my bf....they will lose me.And that they will have to carry in their mind forever. I have lost respect from my cousins and soon my family. I will not stop now...i have lost too much...i will not lose the only person i love...."

"event","Today I have no school and I'm bored as hell. My cousin and his friend went out to see a movie, i wanted to come but i had no cash. And today my friend was mouthing of my bf for no apparent reason. So i needed to set her straight. She still refuses to say sorry to him, so I'm gonna make her life a living hell till she does. here's another random poem:

I promised myself I wouldn't cry
But deep inside i thought i would die
To close the door to my heart
In that I was pulled into the dark
I was waiting there in dispair
As my chains have kept me there
Waiting that one would hear
My screams of agony inspite of fear"

"event","Well today was very tiring. I needed to run 830 m. MAn did it hurt, and what sucks is the fact that i wasn't even alble to beat my own time. I went from 3:39 to 3:41. Then i had a basketball game after that. I inujured my knee while trying to save the ball from going out. I can barely bend my knees and the funny prt was...i wasn't even able to save the ball. Then when i came home i was greeted by another problem. Wow wat a surprise. My Aunt and Uncle know about me and my boyfriend now....and well I think they are just being skeptical right now. But i dunno. I'm kinda scared but, at the same time i'm not sure i can do anything about it. So i kinda figured there isn't really a point of crying about it. My Bf was crying too, me and him were contemplating of breaking up. But i decided to lighten up the mood and it worked. Well I hope everything works out fine...i just hope."

"event","Well,I'm starting to hate myself. I'm making my cousin feel like shit, and I'm making myself feel like shit. My cousin recently found out about my relationship with his bestfriend. The thing is, we have been hidng our relationship from everyone for about 3 months. And My bf is also older than me. Now my cousin has found out and he needs to lie to his parents because they have been asking about me and his bestfriend. If they find out, my bf won't be able to come over and I will be sent away, back to my parents. They have been repeatedly asking him about us, and he hates lying. Or that's what he says. In his eyes he says that my relationship with my bf isn't what i think it is, he thinks it's just a ""infatuation"". Whenever i try to tell him it isn't he says that I'm young and that i don't know what i want. And he says that he knows this because he has been through alot. But he has never been in my position. I'm beginning to become a void in their friendship, a crack in a mirror. I don't want this to happen. Sometimes I just want to fall on my knees and cry, but somehow my tears have dried out. I just want to scream out. My cousin wants us to stop it, he just doesn't want to say it.I know what I'm feeling and it's not the stupid fucking ""infatuation"". I'm not the little girl anymore...I've grown up...why can't anyone see that? I know what I'm doing. I'm not the same stupid little girl. I wish everything would just go back to normal...but now, I'm not even sure what normal means anymore."

Human flesh withers and dies before my eyes
Flowers bloom, only to fade
Trees drop green leaves never to regain them
In my sight it's always winter
Always night

Yeah, just a random poem that I made."

"event","raven pointed out that I had vanished..

I did, sorta..  I got distracted.  

I didn't really find a comfy fit here for the most part so I bulldozed my way into a number of sock knitting yahoogroups, and found one I think fits me pretty well.. and I started another blog.. http://www.knittwisted.blogspot.com/ I think is it. 

since early may.. lets see.. graduation happened, the company left, aidan left, aidan came back, mother's day happened (was fun), erin had surgery and lay on my couch for a week, daphne came with her and alfred came whenever he wasn't working or sleeping, then she left again, and we've been generally boring since then.  

the garden is doing pretty well for our garden, it's exploding in green beans and has given up 2 tomatoes so far.  the squash looked like they might actually grow squash this year which was really exciting because for some reason we just *cannot grow squash* and I like squash a heck of a lot more than I like tons of green beans but they appear to have aborted all the squashlets now so back to business as usual.  beans and tomatoes and peppers are about what we'll get.  there's some volunteer tomatillos out there too.. they'll bloom and look interesting all summer and if they survive long enough, finally set fruit when it starts to cool down again..

I knitted more socks, but not a lot, just 3 pairs.. I just finished the third pair a bit ago so I'll start another tonight sometime. :)"

6 balls and a smidge of jojoland.. melody, I believe, fingering weight, 220 yards/50g.. it would have been long enough and finished at the end of the 6th ball but I finished on the wrong row and had more yarn so I decided to do one more pattern repeat rather than tink back.  37 pattern repeats total got it to about 70"" pre-blocking.  I don't know how long it is now.. my tape measure stops at 6'.. but it's at least 8, if I stand and hold it as high as I can reach  (about 7.5') there's still wadded fabric in my hands so.. at least 8'.  :)<br

"event","I have some new friends that I don't know now, that's pretty cool.  hello, new friends. :) 

erin's reprinted graduation announcements arrived today and while the language is still awkward (bachelor of arts in journalism and mass communications in visual communications.. surely some punctuation would help that.. or.. something..) at least all the letters of all the words are there this time, so I guess they'll do.  

had a nice easter.. I thought aidan was coming home for the weekend and erin was just coming home for the day but it worked out the complete other way, erin and alfred (and daphne, my grand cat) came for the weekend and aidan and lucy came just for the day.  but it was nice and fun.  ted yardened and gardened over the weekend and my deck is full of pots of blooming prettiness and the vegetables are all in and there's flowers in most of the places flowers should be. :)

knitting like a crazed maniac trying to get that wrap finished by graduation.. I have 19 repeats and it measures about a yard, unblocked.. so I'm going to call it half done.. maybe even a repeat or 2 past half, I think I'll aim for 36 and declare it finished.. I think my goal is somewhere around 68 inches, but I guess more is better.  my speed has improved because I'm making fewer mistakes, probably :) so I can get 20 rows done, maybe even 24, before I go insane.. provided I have enough time to do 20 rows.. so.. lets say 9 days.. it oughta be finished in 9 days.  what's today, the 18th?  18 and 9 is .. 27?  whoa!  with a week to spare.  Ok... I believe I'm good. :)  and.. having a week to spare means I might get the house into some kind of shape before the graduation company arrives.. that wouldn't be a bad thing.. (but I'd rather knit..).

couldn't work on it over the weekend because erin was home so I made some progress on my sock that will never be finished, too.  it might even.. BE finished, in 9 days, as well.. wouldn't that be exciting.  actually.. it might be finished sooner than that.. it should be, I just don't really like knitting this sock.. but I'm itching to start 3 others so.. plodding along... 

and my mystery project is just kind of sitting there waiting for me to knit my other fuzzy foot so there's enough stuff wanting felted to justify using that much hot water... I need to felt my swatch so I can decide how much bigger it needs to be. :)  

alfred reported last night that the ugly mouse in a tutu is now missing it's tail, it's rump and it's face because daphne ate them so I guess I should knit up some more mice before that load goes in to be felted too. :)  I don't know how good for her wool mice are but they're bound to be better for her than coaxial cable, which is her fall-back snack.

tomorrow we're going to see thoroughly modern millie with erin and alfred, but taking them and aidan and lucy to dinner first, to celebrate aidan's birthday, sorta.. he's too busy to be bothered with us thursday (which is his actual birthday).  :-P  that should be fun. :)"

I have one more ball of the stripe, and the odd bits left over from each sock, the yarn store gal wasn't sure I would get 2 socks out of just 2 balls so I got 3.. and a ball of solid yellow, so I think I'll make a pair of mismatched sneaker socks.. ankle socks, with yellow heels/toes for myself.. I believe there's enough of the stripey stuff to get a few rows of rib, a couple rows of stockinette and the foot.. I'll cast on with the leftover bits each time and they should nearly match at the top, that way. :)<br /><br />I may have to buy some more of this yarn and make more, I found some on sale online but I'd like to get that pair knitted up and worn and washed and worn again before I spend the money, make sure I like them as much in use as I do just sitting on the table.<br /><br />I went to sams friday and bought myself 4 pairs of new glasses for 19.98 :).  my bifocals still get the job done for most things but these stronger specs sure do make picking back the mistakes a lot easier (because seeing the stitches is important then :P). so.. next on my list is.. picking back to the mistake and finishing the black capelet, and picking back to the mistake and finishing the lacy scarf, and blazing forward on the sock I'm working on for myself.. I've been allowing myself one 6 row pattern repeat as a reward once in a while while I'm working on these things that aren't for me, that I really need to get finished.  not sure how tall I'm going to make these, they're a cotton blend I'm intending for summer socks too, I may call it time for the heel after one more pattern batch.<br /><br />anyway.. mary sue's socks. :)<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","I spent all of the last.. ok, that must not be true.. since I finished that sweater tuesday, I did nothing but work on this sock for my sister's birthday.. which was last week but I have til next friday to make these socks a pair because she's coming down to visit me :) because the musical theater club erin started at usc is doing their first real actual play next weekend.. sweet charity.. and erin is going to be charity. :)  anyway, I was making that scarf for mary sue but when I talked to her on her birthday and told her her present wasn't finished yet, she said ""are you making me SOCKS?!"" so then the scarf went on hold and I commenced socks, with a break over the weekend to make that scarf aidan wanted before he went back to school then I decided to make erin that sweater because she's so stressed and cranky so anyway, since tuesday I've been working on these socks.. this sock.. and I finished the first one today, and it's reasonably attractive, but too tight at the ankle to actually go on a foot. :(  

which is a shame because it's actually fairly fancy and would be a nice sock if it fit.  sometime soon I'm going to have to actually study this sock knitting thing so this socks that don't fit thing stops happening. :P

anyway, I started a different pair of socks this afternoon.. bigger needles, fatter yarn, shorter plainer sock, if I work on nothing else I should be able to crank this pair out by the time sunday is over.. provided the first one fits when it's finished.  

I'm a little frustrated, today.

I got 2 batches of cookies made for a bake sale tomorrow, though.. that was reasonably productive.."

"event","ok.. I finished aidan's scarf on saturday but he took it with him (I think..) and I didn't photograph it.. it's not really very remarkable anyway.. big fat oatmeal colored lionbrand yarn, #13 needles, 22 stitches in a 2x2 rib all the way up til I'd used up most of 2 balls of yarn.. I did make a dead many tailed-mouse out of a bit of it and there's.. oh.. maybe 15-20 feet left.

sunday I started this <a href=""http://peonyknits.blogspot.com/2005/11/anthropologie-inspired-capelet-fo-and.html"">capelet</a> in black, for erin.  yesterday I went to buy a pin to hold it shut and decided the pin wanted different color yarn so I went and got different color.. not exactly what I needed, ac moore just doesn't have the right yarn for this thing and the yarn store isn't open til thursday, by which time I'll be over capelets completely.. anyway, got this brown yarn and came home and started another one, after lunch.  finished it a little ago

that's the capelet, and here's a close-up of the pin.. the actual garment is a color somewhere in between the two colors it appears to be.

that's what I wanted to say last night but I didn't because every time I said it out loud, someone glued themself to me.. so I was scared to say it to the internet.

and when I started talkin' this, I was alone, and it was nice.. but I didn't need to be sad right then.  not complainin'.

this was a day of undoing and rebeginning.  I made a muck of the lacy scarf.. not a huge muck, I just need to go back 4-6 rows.. probably 5.. and it's stressful to undo because I don't yet fully understand the magic that holds it together so I only half did that, I'll finish tomorrow to where I can go forward again. probably.

I gave up on the sock I was making out of the yarn from my ripped out first pair of socks today.. it really was pretty perfect except I wasn't convinced it was going to fit.. I jumped into this sock knitting much like I jump in to everything else.. without reading the instructions.. and I really should have at least taken the time to learn the math. I still need to do that.  meanwhile, I started a whole new sock today.. and I may start a whole new one tomorrow too. :)

I yanked out the scarf that I intend to be for aidan and started it over again, different.. this is the 4th time I've done that and I'm pretty determined this will be the last time too.  I got almost to the end this last time and still yanked it out this morning but this time, I'm sure that someone will like this scarf.  it might not be aidan.. but, it is likeable.  someone will like it. :)

I got yarn yesterday to make my cat bed, I think I got enough.. and a surprise :) and the green to make a new cord for melanie's purse, ac moore had 33% off all yarn so I got what I needed for what I need to do next.  

I might take another picture or two tomorrow."

"event","I'm 7 pattern repeats into my scarf now and I can even get through the whole repeat without having to talk myself through it out loud, stitch by stitch.  I'm still doing it in my head, but at least the rest of the world isn't listening too.  :) it's only about a foot long yet, but progress happens, and it's encouraging, I can see it getting finished.. maybe by sunday, even. :)

melanie's purse and the ballerina mouse (hehe. maybe..) are in the washer, felting.  cross your fingers they come out well.  well.. the mouse matters absolutely not at all but it would be cool if it came out well..  maybe tomorrow I'll take some more pictures.

.. more. :)

this purse came out of the washer the first time more fully felted than any but the last one, lucy's, did the second time, with the kureyon.. I probably should have made it a little bit taller.  ok.. maybe even 3 or 4 inches taller.. I think it'll be OK.. it'd be perfect for me.  she might like it a little taller. 

but I was really pleased with the way it felted, and I think I love this yarn.. I did this one in asparagus colored Araucania Nature Wool with stripes of black brown sheep nature spun worsted because noro didn't have a colorway that was green enough for melanie.  I got the yarn at the yarn store same time I got the kureyon, so it was on sale, but AC moore sells this araucania stuff too.  I've been wanting to make a bigger felted bag, for a knitting tote.. something sturdy enough to stand and not so expensive I'll go broke doing it, and now that I've felted this stuff up, I'm thinking I should devote a few weeks to using my AC Moore coupon to aquire some of this stuff in a color that is not asparagus green, for that purpose.  it's also sturdy enough I think it would be great for my cat bed, even though that calls for a heavier weight yarn.. maybe I should think on that a little more.

I absolutely *hated* this yarn until I started knitting with it, though.. it comes in a hank, and it took me DAYS to get it wound into a ball.. obviously, there is some secret to hanks of yarn.  so maybe I'll buy one more skein at the yarn store and get the gal to show me how to make it behave.  that'd be worth full price.

the ballerina mouse was not a success.  It will be a nice cat toy, soon as it dries and I stuff it with catnip and sew it's rump shut but it is not attractive.  it might have been attractive if I'd left off the 2 rows of fun fur I carried along in an attempt to make a tutu.. but I'm thinking he probably needed a little more shaping than just knitting a triangle and seaming it together.  I gave it a 3 stitch i-cord tale though, and that felted up nice and sturdy and ought to take daphne a few minutes longer to chew off than the tails on storebought mice."

"event","I haven't finished a thing, except the i-cord for melanie's purse and a rudimentary dead mousie with many tails, for my grandcat, daphne, who is visiting and eating all the tails off harpo's mice.

I started several things, though.  I restarted my fuzzy feet, I.. can't recall if I have one more gusset decrease to go on the first one or if I just finished that and it's straight on several miles to the toe.  I started yet another sock, so if you count the slipper as a sock, I now have the first sock of 4 pairs on needles.. but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to ever finish one of them and I'm stewin' on the other one.. the one I started yesterday is the redo of my first pair of socks.. it's coming out much smaller the second time.. more smaller than I expected, actually, but I'm pretty sure not so small it won't fit.

I needed something that wasn't a sock, though, so.. today I started this <a href=""http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring05/PATTbranchingout.html"">branching out scarf</a> from knitty.. 5 times.  this last time I made it to the 8th row of the lace repeat before I wound up with one more stitch than I was supposed to have and I about cried because that was 5 rows further than the previous record but this time it was far enough developed that I was able to stretch it out (I pinned it to a box..) and analyze the pattern to figure out where I had an extra stitch, and back up and just.. drop it.  heh.  that probably was a bad idea but nothing else fell apart when I did that so.. we're gonna call it good for now.  most of the other times I started over I got to the end of the row and didn't have enough stitches and I wasn't able to figure out how to back up a row with all that twisty mess goin' on in there to even try and figure out where I might have goofed that.

anyway, I'm pretty excited now that I can tell there's a pattern to this mess and pretty intimidated at the prospect of doing it over and over again until it's a scarf because boy howdy, has it taken me a long time to get this far!"

"event","I was wandering around this afternoon and wound up back at smileysyarns.com and they have a pretty nice price on the reynolds lopi..

earlier I was wandering around elsewhere and found a really nice tutorial on kool-ade dying.. this was on making self-striping sock yarn, that was part of what made it so interesting.. it hadn't occurred to me that so much thought needed to go in to making stripes.. math!  it takes math! and she started with yarn that was already pink so she only had to dye the 2 ends to wind up with 3 colors, that was also interesting..

so kitty beds and kool-ade and stripes were swimmin' around in the dark corners of my brain when I went to smileys and saw this lopi, and they have it in natural..  so now all 4 of those things are playin' marco polo 'round in my head and I'm thinkin' maybe I oughta make a kool-ade dyed lopi cat bed.. 

I already scoped out the fence to verify that the pickets stick up over the cross pieces, which oughta facilitate winding the yarn into long loops.. although something as big as cat beds, taking into consideration the awkwardness of walkin' the whole perimeter of the fence, what with wood piles and compost piles and brush piles and shrubberies.. I expect I'm not likely to really end up with stripes for long but still, something nice and.. splotchy, at least?  

I'm gonna let that simmer for a few days and see if it still sounds like a good idea..

making my own self-striping sock yarn is really an interesting thought though, I must next find a deal on appropriate yarn for that project.."

I guess I'm going to *have* to order some from knitpicks, so I'll *have* to order some other stuff too, to get free shipping.  *boo hoo* <br />(was that convincing?)<br /><br />I listened to a very long (relatively speaking) podcast this afternoon, it was the 1st birthday edition of ""knitcast"" and was really quite boring, as it was all about podcasting, there were a hand full of other knitting podcasters on and interviewed.. so it was interesting in that it gave me a couple others to try and dig up to give a listen..<br /><br />one of them is called something like secret knitting?  and apparantly the gal gives you a project to do and tells you how to do it but doesn't tell you what it is!  so you have to knit it to find out.  this concept intrigues me a little but apparantly, she's done socks and is moving on and.. I'm really enjoying socks, I'm not sure I *want* to move on yet..  but she did say that one of the things coming up was going to be neckties.. and I might could get into knitting a necktie.. that can't take much longer than a sock..  anyway, that one sounded pretty interesting, so I need to hunt that up.<br /><br />I would like to find some podcasts that would read me a story.  a good story, ideally. <br /><br />oh!  this picture is one of the socks I'm working on now.  that's a picture of it yesterday when it still looked fairly normal.<br clear=""all"" />"

I headed out to AC Moore armed with my trusty 40% off coupon and came home with a ball of lion magic stripes,and proceeded to knit myself another pair of socks.  using the same 56 stitches 56 rows pattern, but with 1,1 ribbing for the cuff, and 3,1 ribbing for the leg.  the first socks were so floppy, I figured I'd rib the next pair.  and.. that worked pretty well on some levels.  <br /><br />In the process of knitting these socks I learned that knitting in the front loop and knitting in the back loop produce two completely different.. looks.. I discovered this when I switched from back to front halfway through the first sock. :P  SO there is no picture of these socks!  the first one is knitted twisted to about the heel flap and then straight to the end and the second one is straight from top to toe.  I like that one better.  they are nice warm ugly socks, though.<br /><br />the other thing I learned from that pair is that just because a ball of yarn looks pretty in the ball does not mean it's going to look pretty as a sock.  I really don't find these colors or that striping pattern appealing at all.  oh!  and I also learned that all sock yarn is not the same, this pair was not floppy at all.  they fit quite nicely. <br /><br />SO.. I went back to AC Moore with another 40% coupon and bought another ball of magic stripes, in a colorway that did *not* appeal to me, much, as a ball, and came home and knitted this pair of socks you see in this picture, almost exactly to the 56x56 pattern and wound up with the best socks yet.. they're not beautiful but they're not ugly either, they fit great, they're comfortable, they wash well.. I love them. :)<br /><br />so.. that's the end of chapter 3.  aren't those nice socks?  :-D  they even almost match.. and with the coupon you get a nice 75% washable wool pair of sturdy socks for under 4 bucks.  gotta love that. :)<br /><br />this morning I stumbled across a post on some forum that mentioned listening to podcasts while knitting in an airport or something and one of those dim flickering nearly burnt lightbulbs fired in my brain flashing ""!!podcasts!!"" so.. I ventured off to explore that concept a bit.. I didn't even know if you could listen to podcasts without actually having a.. pod.  turns out you can. :)  <br /><br />so, I listened to the musings of a peaceful knitter.. which didn't do a lot for me.. it coulda been all zen and insightful but mostly it was.. not.  but it was the first.. issue?  edition?  volume?  occurrance of this particular podcast so maybe it will be more worthwhile in the future.<br /><br />then I listened to ""the mosh knit"" which was definitely not zen at all.  haha.. <br /><br />so.. now I am off to the yarn store, by way of the used book store, provided I remember I intend to go there before I take the shortcut that bypasses it.. I need another pair of #1 needles, a bottle of eucolan, and.. ideally, something that will make a pair of socks with 0% sheep and minimal % plastic, for my sister's birthday.  and a 7 layer burrito. :)<br /><br />I'm not sure what made this knitting thing explode into a nearly full time obsession the last month but once in a while I wonder if the fact that the yarn store is right behind taco bell has anything to do with it. :P<br clear=""all"" />"

They turned out the way I expected them to and didn't take forever and were a lot of fun and it was very satisfying and the sale at the yarn store ran thru the 28th, so on 1/26, a week later, I went back.<br /><br />I got enough of the kureyon to make 2 more bags and a pair of fuzzy feet felted slippers.  I got some other wool, the closest color I could find to melanie green and some plain black to make my own stripes, to make another bag, and a ball of opal sock yarn.  those self-patterning sock yarns have fascinated me for years and I decided.. riding the high of starting and finishing 2 things in one week, that it was high time I learned to knit socks.  this was actually somewhat premeditated, I had also found a pattern that almost made sense to me and determined what size needles it wanted (but.. not what size yarn.  sock yarn is sock yarn, right?  er..)<br /><br />so.. I came home and commenced knitting more bags and dabbled in my sock now and then.. I didn't want ted to know I was knitting a sock until it actually *was* a sock and it would have remained a complete secret except aidan popped in that weekend and caught me.  oh well.  I don't think he was impressed.  <br /><br />So.. I knitted more bags and that sock and eventually I finished that sock and both bags and I was so puffed with my finished sock I decided I should knit ted a pair of socks for valentines day. :)  one sock under my belt, I was a pro.<br /><br />well.. not quite a pro.  so I found a pattern that suited me to knit him some socks.. house socks, I learned from the first sock that I didn't understand sock engineering well enough to attempt dress socks.. so I went to michaels and picked up 2 balls of wool-ease, because they had it on sale, cheap.. to practice this sock, and then I went to AC Moore and got 2 balls of gedifra fashion trends (51% wool 49% plastic) to actually make the official socks.<br /><br />so I knitted up the practice sock, it was pretty speedy, I was finished it by middle of the afternoon the next day.  it wasn't perfect but I learned enough in the process to be confidant I could make whole socks that fit ted, so.. then I did that, and there is a picture of them stuck in here somewhere, although I have no faith that it will actually show up unless you pretend to reply.  <br /><br />so.. there they are.. third and 4th socks, the first completed pair. :)<br /><br />I then proceeded to make the mate to the original sock, and I did finish that one too and I was quite pleased with them as well, for a short while. <br /><br />but.. that's another installment.  I must upload another picture before we get to that.<br clear=""all"" />"

I knitted a big pink square for a long time.. years.. and as I recall, it was quite ugly. I was extremely proud of it. :)<br /><br />even then I loved yarn, I saved up my allowance and bought a skein of rainbow colored red heart sport weight yarn and graduated from large ugly squares to narrow ugly strips, which I called headbands.  and wore, quite proudly. :)  later I added other colors, and made more headbands.  then I graduated to troll dresses.. which were pretty much short headbands with poorly executed holes for their arms to poke through.  finally, I progressed to beanbags. that was pretty much it, a few years later I learned to crochet and stuck with that, mostly, because it was easier.<br /><br />off and on I returned to knitting, I knitted a baby hat for my first nephew.  I finished the sweater that was supposed to go with it, for the second one.  I started a sweater for me, once.. decades ago.  mostly I knitted dish rags, mostly I crocheted. mostly, I bought yarn.  less often, I started things. much less often, I finished something. 1 baby hat, 1 baby sweater, a pile of dishrags and a few shower mittens are the sum total of my first 41 years of knitting, in terms of finished projects (discounting those headbands and beanbags) <br /><br />historically, I start things and don't finish them.  it's really somewhat remarkable that I'm not still pregnant with my first child. :P<br /><br />anyway.. it was coming up on my birthday this year and I decided I wanted a new purse.  I prowled the internet looking for a purse both worthy of being a 50th birthday gift and appealing enough I'd actually carry it and I didn't find one.  SO.. I decided to knit one.  I've always wanted to felt something, it seemed like a good combination of desires and inclinations. Found the pattern I wanted to use, and set about finding the yarn the recipe asked for.  it was kinda spendy.. or seemed so at the time.<br /><br />2 days before my birthday, I travelled over to the knitting store and purchased my yarn.  They were having a sale, so I got enough to make 2 purses. that shouldn't be surprising.  what is surprising is that by the following thursday, I had finished knitting 2 purses.. so I went back to the yarn store, and bought yarn to make 3 more purses and a pair of slippers.  it was still on sale. :) <br /><br />anyway, the point of this spate of words was to test out this photo/blog marriage and see if it actually functions..  here's the picture of the first purse finished and the second in progress.<br clear=""all"" />"

hey people's!

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...Umm.. school was okay, despite the fact that I left my backpack at home... Major suckage!!! got on the bus, with a ""tabitha, I love you"" only one though.. because alex wasn't on the bus, but sarah was... so yep... umm.. found out my teacher decided to give me until monday to turn in my Rollercoaster Physics article. that was so due like 2 weeks ago.. it's real nice of him. because if i don't turn it in I fail... 

went to church.. when i got there i kinda went and played the drums a bit.. because i'm so fresh like that. then ate dinner, sat by deanna, across from rachel, and diagnol from justin and jalesa.. how cool is that? well ya probably don't know, but it rocks! lol.. I am so blessed to have people at church that rock so much.. Jessica didn't come... but that's okay. I still loves her anyways!! and uh btw to her i apologize... I was pretty harsh. and so yeah i'm sorry. 

anyways! Brad talked about marraige in church. I liked the message.. I think about marraige alot.. it kinda hit home for me. hmm... I sat beside ashley, this senior that goes to my school that comes every so often. and beside this girl amber, who's a seminary student. she's 29 i think... after church.. went downstairs to the gym. shot some hoops with jalesa.. I kicked her butt.. .so to say... not really.. I'm so out of shape it's crazy... ever since spring of 2004 I've been completely lazy because i haven't played any sports.. I'm going to play softball for church.. because yes I rock! not really but oh well haha... it should be fun. Jalesa is going to play too.. umm.. hmm.. so yeah after playing ball.. we gathered round at the table for some good slang chattin. cuz we're so gangsta! haha... It's funny to hear some of them say stuff like ""crunk"" and watchin' megan do that C-walk.. haha.. uhhh... deanna drove me home, Jenny's parents are in.. pretty cool. got to meet em! besides that.... I'm going to clean my room.. and um do some homework.. peace out!!! ~!*TabithAKay*!~

"event","okay to an entry that i posted on my xanga..that was kinda like the one before the last on here... 
it said.....

um hmm... i had a bad dream last night, that alot of people that I care about told me that they didn't want to be friends and they hated me and i should just go away... i'm starting to think that yeah it could become a reality... 
I feel as if I don't have any friends around anymore... Everytime I make friends they just seem to fade away after a few weeks... 
Kinda like Jessica, she rocks. But she really doesn't have time to talk to me or anything. and I can't talk to her. everytime i call she's always sleeping or studying... so what of a friendship could it be? what of a friendship can anything be when I'm just a rebound child. only time anyone wants to talk to me is when every1 else isn't around.... I don't know I'm thinking about just locking myself away...

.. Jessica replied......


I love you, I do, but you have to understand I'm busy a lot. And I hate that, because I rarely talk to anyone anymore, I mean, just sit down and talk with them. I almost wish I wouldn't make friends because I can't be a friend. I fail all my friends, and that's why I've never had many. I don't like committment and expectations. It's something I have to pray about more. A lot rests on my bad time management. I feel like I never have any time and I'm burdened always with a never-ending list of things to do. I'm really sorry that I'm always so busy or tired or something. I don't know if you've realized, but I've been so stressed since I moved up here. There's only so much I can handle, and I don't feel like I'm even handling what I need to get done. Please try to understand my failings as a friend. It's hard also because we only see each other Wednesday's and I'm here and you're there, and I mean I'm ALWAYS busy. I'm trying to change that, but I'm getting a job soon (hopefully). Who knows what will change for my schedule. I'm truly sorry. I love you, and we have all eternity to be friends. --Jessica"

""we missed you"" ""i love you"" and all this blah blah blah stuff... umm.. didn't go to softball, I'm thinking about quitting being a manager, because I do nothing but take time and waste time. I never know how I'm getting home. and yeah it's just not working anymore, i thought it'd get easier but it's not....

well hmm.. praise God. my head ache is like gone almost... even though it still feels like 20 lbs... hmm.. I'm just sitting here, randomly thinking how great God is.. and how blessed I am.. 

I am so unworthy to be called his child, yet he takes me up in his hand, and like a piece of clay molds me into something so beautiful. and fills me with joy, and hope of a better life, and a promise that i may live in his kingdom forever.  

just a nice thought.. of all the things i think of in the future, that is the best.  then again, everything else to me is quite blurry and scary."

"event","Yep so I'm just starting this.. since some people I know have livejournals instead of xangas.. I most likely will say the same stuff in here as I do in My Xanga's... Copy n paste will save alot of time but yeah... 

as for now I've been sick for like a long time.. it just hits me off and on, but it's been happening alot since october... I'm really struggling as a christian, as a person. I've fallen down so low, but I know with God i can do anything.... 

umm... it's been a 4 day weekend, I haven't slept in any, in fact i've barely even slept any until today, since all I've done is layed there, but I haven't really slept either, just layed..... 

i don't know.. I'm having a hard time coping with things... so yeah... Keep it real... and i'll get back to ya...

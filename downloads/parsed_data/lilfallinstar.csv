I've happened to have made some life plans and that's always exciting (until they don't work out)

And I've happened to come to the realization that I am happy with the woman that I've become... which is more than I can say for most people in this world. I really think that if you're happy with yourself, and you believe in yourself than everything get's just a bit easier.

I am borderline happy *gasp* one or two things in my life could change... and I would be... HappiER. But I'm really okay with the way things are. I really think that everything happens for a reason and I will get what I want in the end either way... because I believe in myself enough to make it happen.

Eh why is it when you're in a good mood you don't have as much to say... as you do when you're upset? I don't know but it doens't make any sense.

Oh and P.S. I love all of you... each and everyone -.-"

"event","Well... like the story of my life things are going great then something majorly sucky happens. Like ruining your cell phone and lap top in the same week.

I'm totally over a lot of things. 

So you know where the is something that you really need to tell someone but you just can't bring yourself to do it? I'm there..., and I've been there for like EVER. It's just that I want to move on and do what I have to do... but I'm not willing to be the one who makes that happen. I am happy with the way things are however I want other things in my life. You know when sometimes you're pretty sure as to the answer that you're going to get to the quesition that you just have to ask, but can't bring yourself to ask it? I'm there too. It makes me want to keep my mouth shut. I'm not ready to be disappointed... I'm not ready to start all over again... I'm not ready to loose a good friend... but I just don't know what to do. (Well I know what I have to do I just don't want to do it) I'm just tired of feeling only partially complete, I'm tired of feeling empty at the end of the day, I'm tired of being selfish, I'm tired of not sharing, I'm tired of feeling like I'm wasting my time, I'm tired of thinking, I'm tired of dreaming, I'm tired of hoping, and most of all I'm tired of waiting for an answer... I'm tired of being afraid to move on, even though I'm scared to do it. I know that it's me and only me who chooses what I do... but I want someone to do it for me -.-

I am looking to gain a lot of things out of life, many in which I have already done. I'm happy, I'm successful and I've done it all on my own. But I'm tired of being my #1 fan. I need support, I need a hug, I need someone who is going to tell me that everything is going to be okay, I need someone to tell me to relax... and help me get there. I need someone to care, I need someone to show me that no everyone in my life that I care about walks out on me. I need someone who's different... I need someone who is special... I need someone who is not going to try and change me. I need to sleep... I need to stop doing it all by myself. I'm ready for help... I'm ready to give up... I'm ready for someone to take care of me. I'm ready for someone who makes me feel like nothing else in the world matters... I'm so over being responsible, respectable, and perfect all the fucking time. In this world... I am totally alone. I'm over people walking out on me, and I'm over people using me... I'm over being taken advantage of... I'm over waiting for it all to fall into place.... and most of all I'm over being afraid that thing won't work out... because you wanna know what? Nothing ever does.

I am not perfect. I have issues. I'm not the person that everyone wants me to be. 

I know what I have to do and I know that I need to do it... because if I don't I'm just going to feel incomplete forever... and even though I don't want anyone to get hurt... I'm not being fair to myself. In the end I'm the only one who has to deal with what I've done.

Geeze. I need a drink -.-"

That was easy?

Wanna know what's not so easy?

Saying something you really want to but you just can't make yourself do it. Why do I always hold stuff in because I'm worried about what someone else is going to think? I guess the whole world is like that but I just feel stupid. Story of my life I guess. I just don't understand why people feel the need to confuse the shit out of me... I guess they think it's fun.

Things are finally coming together a little bit. More mentally and emotionally then physically.
I've come to a very big acceptance level in my relationship standpoint.
I'm ready. I've come to the point that I'm done being hurt and upset and afraid to do it again. I've come to the point where I am no longer furious however I am still pretty annoyed at just the over-all write off. I don't really know how you can just pretend 2 1/2 years of you life never existed but if that is what you need to do then who am I to tell you not to. I've come to accept that the feelings of loneliness are not of missing him but of missing what he represented in my life. I've come to accept the fact that sometimes things just don't work out. I am happy with where I am being who I am doing what I want to do without anyone to question me but I can't say that I'm afraid anymore... because I'm not. I'm ready to live and do whatever I have to do. I'm done hiding. I want to gain as much knowledge and experience that I can. If an opportunity comes around I can't say that I won't take it. I'm done waiting. I'm not waiting for anyone or anything anymore. It's time to do something for ME and whatever and whenever that is... you had better believe I'm going to do it.

I feel good... but something is still missing."

"event","Wow! I can't believe it's almost been a month since my last entry. Time is flying by like you wouldn't believe. Things are going I'm not sure where. My new job is working out pretty awesome. I make ALOT more money... I work 8-5 M-F and I don't really have a whole helluva lot of responsibility, which I have to say is a lot less stressful. However everyone there has a god damn attitude accompained with a chip on their shoulder about something or other. I don't understand how people can mope on in such a miserable fashion. Everyone is pretty much neutral (minus the RN) she... has issues. She's not happy unless she has a stick up her butt, and she's yelling about who put it there.

Not so happy things:
I have to move... AGAIN. Probably to a cardboard box so if you know any for rent PLEASE let me know ASAP! We have to be out by April 30th. 
I like the act of moving because I get to through a million things away and re-organize/decorate everything. However the new place I know will be much smaller, and... not as ""clean"" That blows.... chunks. 

I'm still sick. Which is begining to get on my nerves however I am lacking in medical insurance as of Saturday so that doesn't really leave me anywhere. If I die I hope all of you will come to my funeral and shed a few tears -.-

If I don't get a good night's sleep one of these days... I'm going to go insane. It's not so much the annoyance of sleep it's the fact that after I get off from work... I don't want to do anything but go home and lay down. 

Internal conflict bites. My brain is such a mess! I don't know what to do about a lot of things and I want to just close my eyes and make it all go away... but I know it won't so I just have to plug through it like I always do. Why not just once can't I get what I want without having to beg for it! Oy.

All and all it could be worse. I'm not terribly unhappy just terribly confused! I have a great set of friends by my side so I'm not worried. Just go with the flow, everything happens for a reason and it will all work out in the end... it always does! Just pray that I don't die before I see that day -.-"

"event","Okay... so... many things have happened since my last entry. I am happy to say that I am in a much better place of mind then I was. YAY!

Basically my whole life has changed... I got a new job which is big news, I got a dog who happens to be the coolest dog on the planet. I have more time to ride Shayne and train Renny due to the fact that I get out at five instead of 7. As soon as I get my test results (which should be any day) I can look into going to school. ::GASP!:: Yes. I have recently done a lot of shopping... which always makes me feel better. I have added a tone more skirts to the wardrobe. I am finally comfortable enough with my body to wear them. It's fantastic. As well as a few pairs of boots, including my knee high Steve Maddens (fanfuckingtastic) I have also finally got my red dress... where am I going to wear it? I don't even know.

If there is one thing that I have come to realize it's that your life and your emotions are really what you make of it. Sure there are always variables that play into the equation however you choose to up-play or down-play them.  I honestly don't invest much emotion into the day to day challenges that life throws you. All the little things add up and if you put too much into that... it blows up in your face. I HATE being grumpy and annoyed because it makes me feel miserable and once you get to that place it is so easy to get pushed down even further. Never give up because as many times as I've been there I've always gotten out. Life is about challenge and perseverance. If you don't have the ambitions and goals to face those challenges then there is no reason for you to live and pollute the earth with your negativity. -.- Trust me I'm NOT in any way Miss Suzy Sunshine but I'm probably one of the most laid back people you will ever meet. You either deal with it and laugh or you cry about it. Nobody wants to be around or even deal with someone who is unhappy (even if it's not at directed at them) because it's a total mood killer.  What you have to say to yourself is ""Self... am I going to care about this tomorrow?"" nine times out of ten your answer is going to be no... therefore there is no reason to stress and create anxiety. Everyone has things in their life that they can't control... but when there's nothing you can do about it why put yourself through pain and frustration? It is not worth it in life to be negative... simply because it's no fun -.-

""It's easy enough to be pleasant,
When life flows by like a song.
But the man worthwhile is the one who will smile,
When everything goes dead wrong.
For the test of the heart is trouble, 
And it always comes with the years,
And the smile that is worth the praises of earth-
Is the smile that shines through tears.""

"event","Well... I haven't updated in a while because it's the same old shit, cept... worse. I got a new job which is quasi-exciting I get to make a lot more money and work until 5 instead of 7. That gives me more time to reflect on what a craphole my life has become recently.
The deal is that I'm so tired of not being in control of the things that get me down. There isn't anything *I* can do about any of it and it just gets lonely doing it by yourself. However it's a hard decision whether or not to let people in and give them the ability to hurt you. I swear if you read over all my journal entries most like 9 out of 10 of them will say every time I think I'm moving forward I get pushed back in the dark. That just makes me think is it me? Am I being stupid? Am I being selfish? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. I feel as though I am destined to be alone for the rest of my life because I always find a way to fuck it up. Say too much don't say enough do the right thing do the wrong thing. How the hell are you supposed to live when you're terrified of being left all the time? Just about everyone I've ever cared about has walked out of my life without a look back. I honestly don't think I can deal with it anymore... it hurts way too much and it only gets worse as time goes on. I feel like I'm so starved for love and affection in my life that when I finally get it I fall so hard. So what I have now realized in the writing of this entry (which I probably knew all along...) is that I care too much. I don't know how to turn it off, I don't know when to and when not to. As much emotional pain as I am in right now I wish someone would sit down and tell me look... this is how it is. I have faults just like everyone else... I'm just so confused that I normally end up closing up and being cold. That's not the way I want to be but what the fuck else do I do? Everything was looking so great for... a day. Nobody cares and please don't tell me that you do when I know obviously you don't.

How many times do you think you can just have everything taken away and put it back together again? I don't know what to do because *I* don't want to deal with it anymore because I can't. I don't want to feel this way and right now I don't feel like there is anything in this world that could change that. Well... one thing maybe. How many times do you think you can just get your loved shoved back in your face? How do you know when you should care and when you shouldn't and to what extent? 

I'm no longer looking forward to vacation. I think I might just take a road trip to nowhere and maybe I just won't come back. I now understand why people up and disappear to start a new life. There just isn't anything you can do with the life you have left. I've made myself into what I am today... I used to be determined to be something, but now I don't even want to move on. Things honestly couldn't possibly be any worse. I don't want to be lead on to believe that it will possibly change... I want to know.

Maybe I will leave, change my name, what I look like and then and only then will somebody feel that I'm worth a damn. Maybe somebody will care enough to realize that people aren't perfect they make mistakes and it isn't their intention to cause pain. Maybe then someone will love me for who I am and not who they think I am. (which could possibly be my fault) And maybe then I'll be happy.

I have nothing left and that my friends is the saddest realization in the world. When you realize the only people you thought were your friends will up and walk out of your life because they can't see past situations at hand. I can only hope that I can find the will to live another day and that when I fall to complete rock bottom (I'm at about 9 out of 10) that you'll be there to catch me when you fall."

"event","Just when you think you've got it all figured out, something has to change. 
And just when you think it's all over, someting worse happens.
And just when you think everything is great, something changes the course of your thought.


Just when you think you know what it's all about, is when you realize you really don't know anything at all.

Your entire life is an experiance, one big trial and error session. Some variables you can't control and some of them you can. In my life, most of the variables were ones that I could not control. And the few important decisions I've made were not the easiest. The hardest one in my life, something that could make my life, or break it. I think I've done just alright, but I don't know how long that will last. I work harder than any of my friends I know. And everything I earn goes towards something.

I'm tired but that's okay. Sometimes you just have to sit down and wonder what it was like and what it's like now. What it would have been like if things were different. But you can't change the past you can only make the future, and just beacuse my life wasn't the best apple in the barrel, I can make it... the way I want.

You can't change the path you were given, sorry enough. But Life is an experiance.... one big trail and error....take it as it comes, and do what you like... If it's one thing I've learned you have to do what's best for yourself...

"event","Things are going to get better before they get worse, and trust me I know that better than anyone... so here it goes.

Saturday- Was the big one. The yelling and screaming which singnaled the end of any relations I will ever have with my father. . . ever. I came home from Cara's party and got yelled at cuz I had called Elena ( my dad's ""gf"") and bitched her out because she called me... while I was at Band Banquet, supposedly looking for my mom to see if we got her daughters wedding invitatin.

A. The wedding isn't until July.
B. She's never met me
C. She's met my mom once
D. Hangs up when any of us other than my father answer the phone
E. Calls my dad's cell phone 24/7
F. Why wouldn't she just ask my dad?
G. Why would she even call my mom
H. And my brother said that it was just his ploy to see if he would get his messages. (Cuz she dialed wrong or something)
I. BUT THE FLAW IN IT ALL IS.... SHE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR MY DAD. Mis-comminuication betweent he conspirators of this plan... I think so. OOoOPs Yer B.

SO I called her up and left a message saying that I got the invation and to please in the futer not call me my mother or my brother and to stay out of our lives. Because it's really immature that this was all just a ploy to see if my dad would get the ""message"" Not reallie bad u think?

He got the message. SO it was pretty funny because then my father acutally decided to be my father and ""yell"" at me for something. ::GASP:: but that was the beginning. The man has absoultly no brain cells and I talk to fast for him. He can't comprehend. He contradicts himself about 1238902938 times. I honestly don't think he knows what he is saying as he is saying it... and I defiantly know he donesn't remember what he says. 1 too many pop tops my freind. So after bashing him which was really fun because he is so dumb I told him he needs some professional help for his lack of barin cells cuza his habits. ANd that I had no respect for him and the only things I've ever learned from him was to stand up for myself even when you know its not going to make the differnce. HEHehe he kept trying to show me the credit card bill. ANd i'm like dude, thats not my deal. But I did tell him I loved him only because he's my father and it was 1/2 of his doing bringing me here. ANd I thanked him for that so I can learn and grow and make my life and the lives of others better. BUt that was it. The said part is he probably only comprehended about .3857 percent of it. Oh well.

He told me that I was fucked up and my mom coaches me very well. He just can't stand the fact that I acutally stood up to him. He is used to my bro who says nothing. My.B. He told my my opinion was wrong and I said that's why its called an opinion its what I think. You've done nothing to influence it in a differnt way so you can't even say that. I asked him if he saw it coming and he said yes. Then I said why didnt you do nething and he said you would have hated me then... I said... I already did.

So my mom and I are moving. And my brother is doing.... something. My dad doesn't comprehend that he has to pay me child suppoort... and that's another hing. He told me.... You are 17 years old and.... I go dad.... I'm not 17.... I'm only 16. And my mom said that earlier I was 15. So that's kinda gay. My dad said he is going to buy my mom out... which means giveher half the money the house is worth. Which is good. Plus my child support and we will be doing pretty okay. We're looking for a place to rent and I think we might have found a house. So...

I'm not too upset about them breaking up. I mean that's a given. IT's just harder when you're older cuz you have a ""say"" or so to speak in it. Not agianst the final decision but you see what my dad said to me. I mean damn those fucked up people shouldn't be aloud to walk the streets. THe only thing I'm really upset about is that I have to leave ""my"" house. I'm comfortable here. I like it. That's not cool. But whatever. That and my brother... but whatever you deal. I'm sorry if I'm not that talkative or I don't call or hang out wiht you guys. I'm  packing I'm really tired, stressed and not in the best of mood.

You suck....

"event","I guess the newest god damn news is that I sprained my ankle. We were showing our half way point for recital stuff and I was doing the group routine. We were doing a phuetae (Sp?) and I guess I just didn't want to land right and it made a nice pretty cracking sound. So then Lauren went to get ice, but they made me go to the office... in a wheel chair. And before we even got out of the chorus room the bell rang... ugh. SO I waited for mommie and we went to the ER. THere was no one there so it took 5.2 seconds. I was only there in + out for an hour and 1/2. They took x-rays... and then I got the hated... crutches.

SO yeah I've been pretty pissed off all night... I can't do like anything. I went driving last night at 10 with the pretext of not going home prolly (if at all) till 12 but my mom called me at 11:15 and was yelling at me. God damnit why does she have to make me feel so guilty?

One of the main reasons why I'm pissed off is it takes something like this for my dad to acutally say something to me. HE never says anything unless he is yelling and all of a sudden it's what can I get you... IT pisses me off so bad you have no idea.

And I'm pissed cuz I don't need this... even if it is supposedly for 5 days. I have way to many things to do. SO much for buying a mothers day present. I was gunna do that today but I'm not sure how I might accomplish that.

ANd I'm worried about something reallie bad that makes me kinda feel... BAd lol. But yeah I need to talk to a few people I feel kinda... spaced and that's not good...

Over all I was a freaking nut last night and I DON'T know how I am going to do this.

"event","Let's see. Considering the amount of times I've vomited in my life... and the fact that I have 2 times in the past week. I don't see that as very proportional. And being that one of those times I was dead asleep... and I had to get up and I don't remeber what happened except for the fact that I couldn't breathe.

I am tired. ANd I don't feel good. I feel like shit. Like crappy shit. I haven't done anything I haven't slept less, and I haven't worked more so it really doesn't make any sense to me? I've realized that I've turend my emotions to getting angry and pissed off than sad and depressed. I feel safer and less vunerable that way... I guess. I don't like feeling depressed because I don't want people to bother me and feel bad. Which is why when I'm angry and edgy people just don't ask. I mean this might not be the right way to go around things, but it is working for me.

I honestly don't care. And I really don't think it's all my fault. It's starting to get tiresome and I  can't keep giving myself advice, simply because there isn't any left to give. You can say what you want but it's all been said and none of it works. Look I'm crying again. How... healthy. This really bites hard. You know. I used to be able to push what's making me upset out of my mind and  be happy when I'm around other people. But it's getting harder. I have gone so long learing how to not let it bother me, and it's starting to not work. It invades my mind every second that it's unoccupied. It gets harder not to say something and it gets harder not to scream. Last night, last night was bad. Not that it's a coupla peoles fault but didn't help any. No. I can't do this. I absoulty can't. There are so many thigns missing that it's just not working.

I might as well live alone. I do what I want to do, which happens to be nothing because no one tells me what. NO one says you can't do this or this, until you do that. I make my own schedule I clean when I want. I go out when I want and I come back when I want. I do what I want and I have no one to tell me not to. It gets borning and tiresome and nothing seems to matter. You think that you want freedom from your parents but I tell you, you don't. Maybe some length now and then but you don't want it all gone. YOu don't want it all gone because that's when you realize it's you, and only you.

It's me. It's me and it's always been me. THat's the sad part. I can't cry anymore. I can't talk, I can't think. I can't say anything that hasn't been said. And you'd think that I could leave. If I already have all this freedom but I can't. SO mnay things that I would give up for just this simple thing. 

I can't change what was given to me, but I can change the way it affects me. I can change the future.

Just because the world gives up something, doesn't mean you have to take it. And I won't take it. IT's not fair. You haven't experianced life until you've wanted to change things that you can't. You've hoped and prayed that thing would turn out okay. I always found something good... but now I can't. There is nothing. I can't do anything. 16 years have not prepared me enough for this. Considering all the preparations have been for myself.

I *can't* and I *don't* want to. No matter what you say.
I can't see anything that I have to live for. I'm done being the insturment. THe one that made it better. The one that made it bearable for someone else, and someone else that didn't make it bearable for. What can I do... I can't do anything.

I'm dead on the inside. My soul and my heart have been lost. Hopefully not forever. I don't know. I don't know anything. ALl that's left is for death to my body. Let's hope that my pride and love finds themselves and resurfaces sometime before that latter takes hold  of me.

Cuz I'm gone.

"event","Well you know. Life sucks when you've got a complex.


::smacks head on desk::

Stupid... stupid, complex.

I've actualy come to terms that beacuse of the absence of so many things in my life. I'm generally screwed up.


I have no desire.... to do anything. I just don't care. I don't want to care. I have no desire to care. You all tell me, you should try. And I do... and that doesn't get me anywhere... so ::PooF:: there goes the desire to try.

Now don't get me wrong I love my mom... but there is no encouragement for things that I might not like doing. Like school. She never says well you need to try or, you can do it. It's just like Oh well.... they are good grades good job. (they aren't bad mind you but they could be better) There are no expecations of me. Psht. My dad and bro are out of the picture. So let's see with my mom. All I am expected to do is bet he good little girl and clean up my bro/dad's shit. Be nice say nice things, cuz I'll be the one that's around in the end.

I hate this shit. And that's another thing because I try to stay angry and upset... but I cant, because I don't care. And I don't want to care.... and I know it's bad but... I just don't know what to do?

::angry face:: SO... BAD! I hate this shit I hate it I hate it I hate it.

I can't trust anybody. I can't be with anybody. I can't because I'm tainted. And to be a selfish bitch about it. IT's all my fucking parents fault. I love them I do but what the fuck were you thinking. Just because I pretend to be normal and okay to all of you... doesn't mean that's the deal. Do you think I'm going to go up to people and say, ""Hi! My name is Jen. I'm outwardly happy but inwardly angry. I tend to be a tad messed up in the head though.... will you be my friend?"" God fucking damnit it makes me so fucking mad.

I have a complex.
Did I mention about that.
It's kinda like that one where people are afraid of foreign people and places. So they stay in their house.... ALL THE TIME. But I don't like going places by myself. Infact I won't go somewhere if I don't have anyone to go with me. I can't ask people for things if there isn't someone I at least am aquantied with around. Now you people that know me wouldn't think of me as shy. But that's the thing. Around people, I'm not. Alone I'm crazy. I don't even know why.... and it's not a emotional thing that I can just get over. I physically can't do it. I don't like to call people. I mean what the fuck. This is the only thing I have a desire to do... is fix it because it makes me angry. See you would think if I didn't want to do it then I wouldn't but I just can't. Like I'm tied to it... It's fucking freaky, and it makes me... angry.

And the part that really sucks. Is the sole thing I want... I can't obtain...  because I'm afraid. Because I don't want to deal with it... I don't want to do it... because I have no desire for the potential for more distress. You'd think that something I want more than anything in the world, that's staring me in the face, I would just take it and run. No. I just run because I refuse.


This fucking sucks.
Deeply."

"event","My mom woke my up from work around about 11. I started to clean up the dining room and suprise suprise, I'm still not finished. I haven't done anything. I've had such a horrible week...
Let me list those first.
~Never got home Sunday because of the stupid busses... got home around 4 am Monday... pretty much slept all day with my crampy uterus.
~I didn't want to do anything because I was still coughing and I had bad cramps
~My horse hit me in the face. (Not on purpose but I got a cut on my lip)
~My parents are getting a divorce except my dad and brother don't know about it yet. It's not going to go well. My parents now fight excessivly ever single day.
~I got DQued for my license test Tursday because the stupid racist spanish bitch told me to do something, but I thought she said something else... which I swear she said... but she didn't like me
~ I have no money and I told geoff I was going to go to LaserQuest but Yeah. THat's later.


So yeah. I took my lisc. test today and passed w/ bonus poitns. I went to target and then the barn. Debated on wether or not to go since it was already 7. Got home and started to drive. Finally found it when I got street smart. Was all dark and scary and I figured I wouldnt see anyone I knew so I just went home. I went to pick up Adam and we went to his house with Ash and Alic. Then we went to Baskin Robins where I saw Douglas Lisa. Then I came home and talked to Ashely for a while. It depressed me. Now I am here... and I'm on my brothers computer because the internet doesn't work in my room.

THe only good thing that happened was I found a horse up in Bradenton. But I have to be at the barn at 6 SUnday to drive 3 hours to get her. I am having so many... issues and I want to stay angry and depressed. I need to roost. I am so... done.


I am having boy issues. . . of differnt persuasions. Did I spell that... no I probably didn't. I'm just so angry at people because I feel small and unimportant. I'm trying not to care about things except it's realy hard. I think I've been nicer to people to compensat for my lack of security.

I think that I put on a nice front. Not that I'm lying about who I am, I'm just not showing what my real emotions are. Is that bad? No I don't think so. I don't act sad or angry when I'm out with people because I know that's no fun to be around. I'm compromising myself for the people I care about. I think that's a good thing. Don't get me wrong I don't want pity from people, it's just sometimes it gets really annoying knowing that no one knows what to say. Or no one cares.... or realizes what is really going on. It's really sad when I think of how independant I am. I've done alot on my own. I've made who I am all by myself. I didn't grow up instilled with morals and values. I never got grounded, or punished. I never was told what to do and what not to. (To an extent) I was pretty much free to do what I want. Sometimes I don't want to be alone anymore.... because when you think about it... I really am.

When your not out being social, there is always your family life to dwell on. Excpet for me there isn't at all. Yesterday my mom was talking to me and she made me really upset. She told me the thigns she had done wrong with her life and told me never to say something just to make the situation better. Not to give in so there wouldnt be any confrontation. Because that's what she did.

ANd I got kind of mad at her, and I felt guitly. I am where I am today and deal  with this shit everyday because she was too scared to stand up for herself. ANd now look at what it is. I am strong because of it, and my mother-daugther realationship is completly backwards.

I don't want this responsibility. I'm at the point now where if this is the way it's going to be then I don't want to be here. I don't want to deal with this. I want change my life because I'm not happy and because I won't live like this.

::sigh:: It's just really hard. Especially when you have to do it all alone. But... I'm okay because I'm Jen, and I'm always okay.

I'm having one hell of a shitty week.

Leaving.

The bus ride up was pretty okay. I kind of forget what I did. Later at night I chilled with Evan, then I sat with Aaron for a while... then I got my own seat to sleep. Really good conversations.

Cracker Barrel for breakfast where I had water and bout a prettie horsie because I left my other one at home. We got to the hotel. Went to Cara/Step/Daneille/Lauren's room. With KTC and Holly. We went crusing around town and went to Panera's. Really good.... there is one in Boca. We then found flavored condoms, and went to the outfitters store. TO BUY ear warmers, sccarf and gloves. OH YEAH I FORGOT ABOUT THe SNOW. ::sniffle:: I miss NY!!

Ummm then we had practice which blew. THen we went to the rooms. Made de-caff coffee adn Clara aske me and KT to teach her how to dance.

Went around town next day. Most of the time was spent taking the old-time photo. It was super awesome and so much fun!!! I forget what else we did... oh played laser tag and I was on the boys team cuz there was 1 extra chick. Cruised with Danny and kicked everyones anal passage. Had preformance. Feel asleep during hte other preformances. Preformed. Rocked my solos.... went back in. Stayed up all night talking about ::coughsexcough:: With Clara. Ummm woke up

Holy Shit-

DOLLYWOOD SUCKED MY REAR. We ran away, I hung with Sal, Alexis, Mark, TJ and TOm. We had fun though. Went on the busses. Went to Dixie Stampeed. Was fun. Waiter was really cool. Won stuff. Wasn't impressed with the riding. But that's me.

"event","So this is the newest development in what is now titled ""The Chronicles of Jen's Dysfunctional <i>Family</i>""

My father has decided he is going to Italy. Now this is a nice thing no big deal. My mom has always told me that she had planned on going to Italy with my Dad for their 25 wedding anniversday.

Except my dad is going on thier anniversary with his girlfriend. He is going with her to this cooking thing there. Yes I did say his g/f. Now we have always joked around about it and tongith I seriously asked my mom. Is she really his g/f. She said as far as having sex she doesn't know but they talk all the time on the phone, and they go to regualr meals togheter. Keep in mind this woman IS married... and is very ugly. I've never met her though. 
Her husband isn't going.

So yes, my father asked my mom if it was okay that he ""went"".

WHAT THE FUCK. This is such utter bullshit. It really sucks that  your parents should be divorced... but they can't because we don't have enough money. It also really sucks to hardcore realize that your whole entire life has been a lie. YOu were just to naive to realize it.

It also really sucks that your father thinks your a horrible person... and it's you mom's fault.

IT also really sucks that I'm not 18 and I can't go where I want to go.

It also really sucks that your mom decides to make you feel guilty by asking you not to leave her.... when you know damn well you just can't stay.

It always really sucks knowing that that you can't do anyhting about it, knowing how bad you want it... and knowing how far you will acutally go to get it.

I'm leaving... you just wait... I'm halfway there. One way.... or another.

Does anybody else see the extreme fucked-up-ness that I have to deal with every second of the day. THe fact that I can't be happy because other people invade in my life no matter how hard I try to keep them out. Because I can't do anything with out affecting someone I love.

My father has done alot for me. But it's all been material. To him I am a horrible person because I hate him, but that's not my fault or his fault it's my mothers. He hasn't done anything but make me stronger and smarter and for that I can thank him. He's helped me realize that I never want to be around/meet anyone remotely like him (which is hard beause of my brother) and I wish that he would understand. It's also really hard to see that your father is killing himself... slowly... and he's taking people down with him. Strong indpependant people that have no way of getting away.

I will not live like this. That's all I have to say. I'm smart enough now to realize that the only way to make it better it to get away from it. IT's easy for you outsiders to say just don't pay attention... but that's what I've done for 16 years. Not paid attention to it... and now it comes and totally breaks up in my face.

At least I can admit it... and at least I know I will beat it. 

It's not going to take me alive. It's not going to compromise my happiness.

No.

I'm okay... because I know that *I* will make it better and that my freinds, is a really good feeling.
I'm sorry. Really."

I'm having issues. Serious issues. Bad enough issues to the point where when I get my car and my liscense I'm thinking about leaving, and not coming back. I'm not joking because I am entierly serious. I don't come to school because I'm sick over all the shit that happens in the house and the fact that I... solely me clean up for everything because everyone of my ""family"" members makes me feel guilty in one way or another.

Let's start with my dad. I love my dad I do, especially now when he is helping me out. But he can't buy my love, though it's nice and most people would say yeah he can. He killed my respect for him a long time ago. He's not a part of my life no matter how hard I wanted him to be, how much I TOLD him to be, and how much he didn't care enough to ask. He get's mad and upset about nothing. Not happy unless he is yelling. And says the only reason we keep him around is because of the money. Which is pretty true believe it or not. He doesn't get along with my mother, in fact they don't even talk. Once I get my lis./car she is getting another job so that she doesn't have to sit home with him when I'm not there. How nice! He is a drunk bastard who still thinks we thought he quit smoking. He loses more brain cells everyday and rarely knows what he is talking about. I believe he has almost lost his ability to feel pain. Being as he can gash his hand and keep hammering getting blood all over the place, and light his hair on fire and not even notice. Yes. This is true.

My Brother- Who I also lOvE. It's so great when we get along but it happens for MAYBE 2 seconds a day. Not an exxageration. He doesn't ever go to school and he makes my mom sick because he is always fighting for her. It's really also hard for me to get up going to school, doing homework pass, while he gives up and my mom lets him. Who I understand is 18 and she can't make him do anything. But he sits home and sleeps and doesn't find a job. He gets nothing done ever. At least when I stay home I get shit done. But no that's nto good enough for anyone. This morning I was yelled at cuz I don't even have a hjob ""it's drill team season"" SOrry but my mom WON'T LET ME WORK during season. He is 18 years old there is 3490384 more jobs AvAilAble To HiM. It's not as easy for me to even apply to half of the places he can. It's really unfair all of it and everyone makes me feel guilty and I haven't done much of everything wrong.

Mom- I love her too. It's hard to see her hurting. But sometimes you just have to stick things out. She is pissing me off more often by yelling at me, and explaning things to me like I'm 4. True I do believe she is going through menopause, and all this crap is adding up on her too, but she has no right to take it out on me. Yes I know that the past coupla days I've been out and up and I have been tired, but I went to school. Last night I was up reading history true I was also tlaking online. I don't want to get a C in history so I didn't want to take the test yet. But I was up so late because I took a nap, because I was out so late last night. This is what I got in trouble for. I'm not being treated fairly and I hate why I feel guilty. I know it's hard for my mom but she is placing expectations on me. It would be okay and if my brother wasn't here, of course I prolly would go to school more often, and I woudln't get shit from the world when I stayed home. But of course him not ever going and me evening SUGgEstInG that I can stay home makes it THAT much worse. Like I said, it's not like I don't get anything done. It's not fair that I am making the best with what I have here, and trying to make it work for me when EVERYONE is making it work agaisnt me. I'm tired. I'm serious. I'm tired of cleaning up after everyone's bullshit just because I feel guilty about my mom. It's not fair... and as I look at it I've always done it. I don't want to hurt my mom worse but I don't know what to do. I want to stick by my decision but that adds to it. Why can't I ever do what I want? Why can't I say what I want? And be who I want to be? These things are letting me change me. Granted my mom doesn't play the overprotective game, but she does the guilt trip one very well wether she means too or not. Maybe she is upset because I am growing up and she doesn't want me to leave her like the rest of my family has. That's understandable. Cept she won't talk to me like i talk to her and that's also bullshit. I'm not a mind reader. I tell her EVERYTHING. I'm tired of giving 183% when all I get back is pretty much nothing. Again I'm not saying she doesn't do anything for me, but this is what I am talking about. I'm not going to leave her forever. I have to stick my hooks out there sometime and no matter what happens I'm not going to hole myself off.

Basically I feel as if I'm wasting time. That's the thing I hate worse. I also hate when Mr. J and my ""friends"" yell at me for not coming to school. If you people only know what I go through everytime I step foot in my house. I'm not asking for pit y cuz I've got enough in myself to give it back. You people can't fucking talk because you don't understand. I'm 16 years old, and I'm wearing the pants in my family. You come and tell me that's your ideal position to be in, and that's it's just that easy. Because it's not. I have so many things I'm supposed to do and supposed to say to make EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING ELSE better... what about me? It's my life damnit why is everything so screwed up. I'm seriously going to go off on the next person that even says something about me not being there so I hope it's not you. Even if it is Mr. J. I mean damn if he thinks that so much or w/e then I'll just quit band if he doesn't want me there.

I'm tired of being walked over and abused because I'm the one that feels guilty. I'm the one that always makes it right for everyone else because I hate when things aren't working. I hate when people are mad. I hate that I feel guilty for things that aren't my fault. But I think what I hate most of all, is that I hate when I can't change things.

I'm really not... I dunno. Just... Not."

"event","So it all happned being a cranky loser this morning cuz I was and still am mad tired. But I was ready and I got really pissed off because yet again my brother wasn't going to school. He just sits home on his ass all day and sleeps and does nothing. At least you think he could get a job... Naw he won't even clean his room. The only reason why my mom won't let him drop out is beacuse of the war... I hate him.

THen my mother and I had a LaRgE fight (via txt msg.) about stupid shit. How she expects me to be so much better then him and not throw out my highschool and BLAH BLAH. It's not fair how she holds this shit over my head and then uses against me. I am tired of people telling me what I have to do. It's absoulutly the worst feeling when you wake up and know you're just wasting another day of your life. There are so many things I could be doing... but I'm not. I hate people that can't except me... and I hate people that hide behind the truth...
Adam and I fought to, though he did apologize.

Okay then let me see what happend. Oh MR. J SCREAMED at me today because he was psming. Defiantly made me mad. ANd I took a tiny nap on the chairs in photo so that made me happy.

Came home... Brett was here. I don't like him at all. My attempt to nap... didn't work out. That made me even more mad. Got woken up so we could go to the barn (which I still hasn't happened yet) Called my dad. The gave my car to some friken wholesaler. Who nice. Defiantly WASTED LIKE 3 HOURS LAST NIGHT. SOmeone doesn't want me to drive. My dad said he was so pissed that he didn't look for anything else and he was going to call Craig and bitch. Yay my life- one big bitch fest at someone or another.
Then someone called me. Defiantly didn't care or notice or ask me how my day was. Just thought I was mad at him and I didn't want to talk to him. Doesn't even wanna call me at home.

I'm crying now just cuz Imma a looser with a bad day. Oh well life goes on. Shit happens, you get over it and it happens again.

In the meantime... Fuck You. 

Oh and why do you insist on doing this to me? Why can't you just be straigt up with me once?
Call me if you wanna talk,  If not then that's your deal. But just remember all the time, I'm the one whose real."

"event","GoSh! So many things have happened that I don't even know where to start. I don't remember the last time I wrote in this DaMn thing. I was told by a certian-super-amazing-someone to write so I AM! Go figure. Jen is doing something someone told her to do. Ah. Ha. Ha.

YEAH SO
School- Defiantly sucks. I am doing fine in all my classes but my attention span has seriously dwindled to ... sleeping... drooling (lol j/k) and sleeping... and copying the assigments that my teachers ACUTALLY collect. It's bullshit. Total utter bullshit. I only go to see my friends except it's really hard to wake up knowing you're going to throw yet another day away. I don't want to go to school. I don't need to learn anything. I don't want to be anything what myself... what bothers me is why people can't accept that. Maybe it's not thier idea of of life but it's mine. Why am I not aloud to hold my own opinion? Defiantly... NOT.

Guard- Has only 2 weeks left. A lot of people have started not to care. I care... Yeah. Except my shins hurt. Really bad. The spilnts are getting Worse. It feels like my bone is pressing out of my skin. How icky. It's from running aorund on the floor with no shoes, and dancing. Jumping on and off the props. Really had a hard time tonight but of course no one knows!! I am so not one of those DraMa peoples, though I really hate not being paid attention to... sometimes I do.

Family- I HATE IT. I have a drunken father who is loosing more brain cells every day. I swear one day he will explode the grabage can that he puts his beer cans and lit ciggarets in. Oy. My brother is very Bipolar. I mean it. He is crazy. One minute I can be having so much fun and the next being yelled at and called names. Ugh. Mom- I defiantly have a menopausal mother. Enough said.

Adam- Things are great. You are a ho tho. It's okay I still love you. Defiantly enjoying having a real best freind. Remember the good times. Are you tappin Becca yet? What takes you so long? Jeezus just get some god damn balls already. ::smile::

Jen's super amazing new love inetrest- DEFIANTLY DON'T ASK! All you need to know is that I'm happy and I'm having a good time doing whatever. Things are spiffy n stuff like that. I gots someone new and exciting to talk to, who is awesome to hang out with. Plus YOU HAVE SUPER AMAZING FRIENDS. Defiantly cool to hang out with guys. So much better LOL.

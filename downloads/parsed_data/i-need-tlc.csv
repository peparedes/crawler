"event","Today was cool. I bought a cd, went driven(still geting used to the stick shift) and partied with my homies. Me and jacob went to the mall. Then i got home then went to dannys, then got scott and david. I told scott to tell his mom that i loved her which he did and i dont even know her, so i bet i freaked her out a bit so i apologize for that. Im so glad i got my license im soo not goin to enjoy paying for gas though i used a 1/4 of the tank today and i dont think i really wnet anywere but o well. I want to put a cd player in my car so i dont have this ghetto crap up in there. i totally forgot wat i was talkin about. O if anyone has one of those jamacian flag license plates and dont want it anymore holla at your boy and ill buy it. I wonder how much usless crap i could put in here and if anyone would read it. I wish i had one of those asian massues to massage my shoulders right now cus they hurt. I love sonic, cus there are always weird people there and the food is so nice. I love you. lol thought i would throw that random goodness in there. I have almost filled the whole page so i can go to sleep. I wanna go to a prom
cus i would like get a baby pink suit wit a white tie and white shoes and that would be pimp. HERES A GREAT THOUGHT! Who would u rather be locked in a room with marilyn manson, or micale jackson. Respond and tell me wat u think.

"event","HI

I got my license today which is super cool. Makes me feel like a man, only wish that was true. I move in 3 weeks which is kinda cool. Jacob and i went skateing at the post office today and saw victor danny and josh which was cool. I don't know but i just been like in this super low and i feel like crap all the time but i like accomplished alot lately. Like i've got my license and i passed the whole lifegaurd course no problem. I think its just because all my friends i used to have dont deal with me anymore and makes me feel a little depress. Because really i shouldn't care because if they don't want to be part of what i have going on then y should i care about them, but i guess it doesn't work like that. Maybe one day my life will be like i've always wanted and ill be happy. Wat the hell is with these new nikles y they have to be changeing this mony up all the time its a pain in the ass i like the old money. Really i think we should get rid of change its stupid and makes a gross sound in my pocket. So yea its kinda late so im going to go to bed. So let me start a new thingy im going to leave a quote with all my journal entrys now. Man this is gonna put so much pressure one me now to come up with good ones i just hope i can do it.

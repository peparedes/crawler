"event","so i am quite new to this, i got the idea through a friend that i knew in highschool, havent talked to her in person in a couple years, dated once, missed her so, she is truly beautiful. i thought it would be cool to get into this journal thing, something to take up more of my time. so..... this is what a journal feels like.... pretty cool lol. for those of you that dont know i go to college in NY to be a Chef. i will be externing in Stowe VT for 6 months starting in Feb. cant wait... then i have 3 more yrs of good old schoolin to get me an edjumacation. 
not much new on my part... just at home hangin out with old friends, missin my girl at school, (the only thing ill miss over extern) but ya know.... until next time..."

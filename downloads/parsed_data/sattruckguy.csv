"event","For those who take their right to vote as a given and something that does not need to be exercised:

This is the story of our Mothers and Grandmothers who lived only 90 years ago.

Remember, it was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote.

The women were innocent and defenseless, but they were jailed nonetheless for picketing the White House, carrying signs asking for the vote.

And by the end of the night, they were barely alive. Forty prison guards wielding clubs and their warden's blessing went on a rampage against the 33 women wrongly convicted of 'obstructing sidewalk traffic.'


(Lucy Burns)
They beat Lucy Burns, chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night, bleeding and gasping for air.

(Dora Lewis)
They hurled Dora Lewis into a dark cell, smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold. Her cell mate, Alice Cosu, thought Lewis was dead and suffered a heart attack. Additional affidavits describe the guards grabbing, dragging, beating, choking, slamming, pinching, twisting and kicking the women.

Thus unfolded the 'Night of Terror' on Nov. 15, 1917, when the warden at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket Woodrow Wilson's White House for the right to vote. For weeks, the women's only water came from an open pail. Their food--all of it colorless slop--was infested with worms.

(Alice Paul)
When one of the leaders, Alice Paul, embarked on a hunger strike, they tied her to a chair, forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited. She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press.

So, refresh MY memory. Some women won't vote this year because - Why, exactly? We have carpool duties? We have to get to work? Our vote doesn't matter? It's raining?
 

 
 Mrs Pauline Adams in the prison garb she wore while serving a 60 day sentence.

Last week, I went to a sparsely attended screening of HBO's new movie 'Iron Jawed Angels.' It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say. I am ashamed to say I needed the reminder.
 
Miss Edith Ainge, of Jamestown, New York  

All these years later, voter registration is still my passion. But the actual act of voting had become less personal for me, more rote. Frankly, voting often felt more like an obligation than a privilege. Sometimes it was inconvenient.
 

 (Berthe Arnold, CSU graduate)
My friend Wendy, who is my age and studied women's history, saw the HBO movie, too. When she stopped by my desk to talkabout it, she looked angry. She was--with herself. 'One thought kept coming back to me as I watched that movie,' she said. 'What would those women think of the way I use, or don't use, my right to vote? All of us take it for granted now, not just younger women, but those of us who did seek to learn.' The right to vote, she said, had become valuable to her 'all over again.'

HBO released the movie on video and DVD . I wish all history, social studies and government teachers would include the movie in their curriculum I want it shown on Bunco/Bingo night, too, and anywhere else women gather. I realize this isn't our usual idea of socializing, but we are not voting in the numbers that we should be, and I think a little shock therapy is in order.
 
Conferring over ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution at  National Woman's Party headquarters, Jackson Place , Washington , D.C.

 Left to right: Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, Mrs. Abby Scott Baker, Anita Pollitzer,  Alice Paul, Florence Boeckel,  Mabel Vernon (standing, right))


It is jarring to watch Woodrow Wilson and his cronies try to persuade a psychiatrist to declare Alice Paul insane so that she could be permanently institutionalized. And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse. Alice Paul was strong, he said, and brave. That didn't make her crazy.

The doctor admonished the men: 'Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity.'

Please, if you are so inclined, pass this on to all the women you know.  We need to get out and vote and use this right that was fought so hard for by these very courageous women. Whether you vote democratic, republican or independent party - remember to vote."

"event","I receiver this the other day from a friend and I think my fellow ""Geezers"" will relate. 

The other day, someone at a store in our town read that a Methamphetamine lab had been found in an old farmhouse in the area and asked me a rhetorical question. 

""Why didn't we have a 
drug problem when you &amp; I were growing up?"" 

I replied, I had a drug problem when I was young-- 

I was drug to church on Sunday morning 
I was drug to church for weddings &amp; funerals 
I was drug to family reunions &amp; community socials no matter the weather 
I was drug by my ears when I was disrespectful to adults 
I was also drug to the woodshed when I disobeyed my parents, told a lie, 
brought home a bad report card, did not speak with respect, spoke ill of 
the teacher or the preacher, or if I didn't put forth my best effort in 
everything that was asked of me 
I was drug to the kitchen sink to have my mouth washed out with soap if 
I uttered a profanity 
I was drug out to pull weeds in mom's garden &amp; flower beds and mow the 
yard for dad 
I was drug to the homes of family, friends, &amp; neighbors to help out some 
poor soul who had no one to mow the yard, repair the clothesline, or 
chop some firewood and if my mother had ever known that I took a single 
dime as a tip for this kindness, she would have drug me back to the 
woodshed 


Those drugs are still in my veins and they affect my behavior in 
everything I do, say or think. 
They are stronger than cocaine, crack, or heroin and if today's 
children had this kind of drug problem America 
would be a better place 

God bless the parents who drugged us!!!"

"event","<P>when i finally started going to therapy a few months back, and my therapist finally dragged the entire story out of me, he asked me if firefighters, police officers, and others, some of who saw far less than I did, needed help; what made me so strong that i didn't need to see a psychologist until 7 years after the fact?</P><P>I was working in the city on 9/11. 
I got to watch the 2nd plane hit the 2nd tower live while heading down to the scene. 
I watched (and flat out refused to film) people falling to their deaths. 
I had a firefighter drop his equipment bag in my truck, saying he'd come back for it, and never saw him again.&nbsp; (Finally went to a local firehouse a few days later, and they knew he was alive and took the bag)
And I saw both towers collapse. 
In fact I was no more then 3 blocks north of the world trade center complex when the first tower came down.&nbsp; I was covered in the debris and dust for close to 48 hours before i could get home and take a shower.</P><P>I've been in therapy now for about&nbsp;4 months, and the fact that I can type this, the fact that I can think about this, especially today, shows how much it's helped.&nbsp; I still refuse to watch the footage or the movies on tv.&nbsp; I can still see it happening, it just isn't as strong a hit.&nbsp; But I saw it live, I do not need to see it again. And i refuse to help some film maker make a profit off of that disaster.

But if I come across the footage on tv, i don't immediately cringe, i don't immediately start to cry.&nbsp; It still hurts, but I can live with it.</P>"

To celebrate, I did the only logical thing that I could possibly do, after working out this morning, I went to chinese buffet for lunch.&nbsp; So ok, tomorrow I'll have only lost 24 pounds, but I'll make that up later. :)&nbsp; 


And my therapist is very happy with the weight loss and the changing of my life style.&nbsp; He pointed out that as I was talking about the weight loss and the working out, my entire attitude and demeanor changed.&nbsp; He said I was smiling and happy and looked good.&nbsp; I couldn't help but smile even more as he said that.&nbsp; :)

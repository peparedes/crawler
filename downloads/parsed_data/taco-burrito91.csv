"event","Remember that fortune cookie I told you about? The one that says the near future holds a gift of contentment. Well, it turns out its bringing me a gift after all. One day after getting the fortune cookie, I found out that special girl that I was thinking about during my lunch hour is coming to California on wednesday! How sweet is that? I'll answer for you......That's pretty cool, Tony. Thanks, I know. I'm pumped. All weekend we've been playing board games.....a little Balderdash, Risk, Trivial Pursuit.....and I've been losing big. The reason is I can't concentrate is because I'm so happy. I feel over-joyed. I feel like I've just eaten a giant NY strip steak. I feel content for the first time in a long time. I don't care about my bills or car now. My brain is fixed on her. 

I've been listening to Ben Lee a lot lately. His music is great. I discovered him during a lunch hour when I went to Tower Records to listen to music instead of eat. I came home that night and bought his CD on my iTunes. His music is mellow and somewhat happy. He has the Elliott Smith sounds mixed with Jack Johnson lyrics. That's the best way to describe him. 

Its already 12:30! I have much laundry to do and even more prepping for wednesday. First I'm gonna eat that Pastrami sandwich from last night. I love food. The weekend was pretty darn good again. I stayed in Hermosa all weekend and we played volleyball for 6 hours yesterday. But have no fear, I don't burn. I'm just a toasty brown. Troy and I played some 2 on 2 yesterday against these guys. I love 2 on 2 volleyball. Its such a different game. There's more hustle involved and every hit is more important because you only have one person to hit it to. We ended up losing our best of 3 match but that's ok. Losing is the first step to success. That was my first time ever playing 2 on 2 and the guys we were playing are at the beach every weekend playing. I can only imagine Troy and I will get better. I think next week we plan on having a 2 on 2 tournament amonst our friends. That should be cool. Ok, I've gotta go, there's much to do."

"event","Here's a small story I wrote at work today. Its dumb, but I wanted to pass the time. Its called LUNCH HOUR. Enjoy! 

I'm walking.....left, right, left, right, left, right......and here I am. The elevator is upon us. I'm saying us because you've gotta have someone with you on your lunch hour. If you don't eat with someone, you might be looked at weird. People will say ""oh, look at him. He's sitting alone....loser"". This elevator takes forever. There's people crowded in and wondering why I'm taking the elevator from the second floor to ground level. I bet I pissed off at least half of the people in this elevator. I wasted at least 12 seconds of their quality lunch time. Well, to answer their question as to why I'm taking the elevator to ground from two is easy. I'm just that damn lazy. Ok, time to go outside. I walk down Brand Boulevard this time. Stoplight. It's red. I can't go anywhere. As I sit here and wait for the international symbol for walk, I'm thinking of a girl. The problem is I can't stop thinking about this girl. When I look around I picture her there. I can't wait to see her and I have to try to block her out of my head. Finally! Mr. White Walk Guy says I can proceed. I have the right of way in this crosswalk. For the next 20 or so seconds, I can do what I want in this crosswalk. I could do a dance. I could sit down and wait for a cool breeze. Or maybe I can just stand and put out the vibe. Ooooh, if I stand maybe that Mercedes will hit me. I'm not hoping for death. Maybe just a broken wrist or arm or something. Stitches would be ideal actually. I don't want to deal with a cast. I just want something that will get me injured enough so that I can sue. Instead of standing to get hurt, I'm just gonna walk through. Now isn't the time to try anything flashy. 

Block 2 is a block I walk on all the time. There's always people coming and going from the 24 hour fitness. Its weird because its an office building. There's a guy wearing an awesome gray suit. I want it. I should ask him where he got it and how much. But I won't. Instead I'll mind my own business. I'll keep walking...lunch awaits me. There's a girl wearing spandex. There's a big muscular guy with arms bigger than my torso. Muscle men look so ridiculous. There's a business woman. She is very pretty. It makes me think of my girl. Dammit, I was gonna try not to think of her. I failed. There's a really skinny asian dude that needs to hit the weights or something. I'm no fine specimen but this guy is like a giant praying mantis....skinny arms, skinnier legs....you could probably snap his arm right now with a little pressure. That girl in spandex really doesn't need to work out. She looks good. I bet she's obsessed with herself. Ok, that's judging. She does look good though. Now there's a group of girls that should be in the gym! Crikey. I have to cross the street because there's road construction coming up. Thank you Mr. White Walk Guy, I will gladly walk through your intersection. If you were a person, I'd tell you that you're doing a great job giving pedestrians the right of way. But you're just a series of lights. Yes, I'm sorry to break that to you. It was a little harsh huh? My bad. I didn't mean anything by it. 

The next 3 blocks are always crowded. Look at all the suits and ties. Oh yeah, I'm one of those suits, aren't I? What time is it in Michigan? 3:17. Hmmmm....I wonder what she's doing. Oh great. Here we go. I hate this crap. We have a group of ""environmentalists"" that are trying to get me to donate some money to good Old Mother Nature. I slipped past one of them, but the one that's looking straight at me seems to know that I'm trying to avoid them like the plague. ""Hello Sir"" he says. ""Would you like to donate a few bucks to save your environment?"" Hmmm...no. But I play the cherade and act all nice to him. Everybody does. There's no point in being an ass to this guy. He's just doing his job. My job is to sit in an office and be a supervisor of our database. His job is to try to get people to donate $10 for nature. He has to know that there aren't going to be many people that donate. How would you like to go to your job knowing that people don't want to hear from you or waste their precious time on talking to you for five seconds. They just want to walk to and fro in peace with no interruptions. It would be nice to walk in peace. I should bring my iPod with me. Then I can just pretend that I can't hear them...and I'd get to listen to music. I could be even more anti-social and just bring my headphones and no iPod. I could put the ear pieces in my head and then just take the cord and put it into nothing inside my pocket. Nobody would be able to tell. Then I could still hear what was going on and I wouldn't have to interact becuase you know that people won't bother a man wearing headphones.  I respectfully tell the man ""sorry, I have to get back to work"" and I point in the opposite direction of my work. Boy did I fool him. I bet those people aren't even into saving Mother Nature. Some people call it hypocritical, I just call it survival. He probably needed a job and this was the best he could get right now. I bet he's an actor. Who isn't an actor in this town? I should stop and ask him what kind of car he drives. I bet its a gas guzzler. I wonder if he car pooled with his fellow salesmen. Did he donate $10 to save Mother Nature? All valid questions that I won't ask because lunch still awaits. 

Only 1.5 more blocks. God its hot. I hear opera music. Hold on. Nope. I don't see anything. Maybe its a car but it sounds like live opera music or a recording playing through speakers. That is so weird. I don't know where the music is coming from. I'm looking around and I can't put it together. There's a sign.....NO BIKES, NO SKATEBOARDS, NO ROLLERBLADES........bummer. What is the big deal about bikes, boards and blades? Apparently the sidewalks are too good for the harsh treatment that urethane wheels pound out. I guess maybe the city of Glendale is concerned that people are going to fall and sue. That has to be it. I wonder if there's a sick mind out there that would fall and break their wrist on purpose to sue the city of Glendale. It could work actually. There are bricks on the sidewalks here. I soon realize that the sign is just an insurance policy and not just a malicious prejudice act toward people on wheels. When signs are posted and someone gets hurt, its their own damn fault. But what if there was a blind person skating down the road. There's no way they could see that sign. They shouldn't be rollerblading in the first place but hey, its LA, it could happen. If said blind person fell and broke his/her wrist, I wonder if they could sue the city of Glendale. People sue for some pretty dumb things. The woman who's dumb enough to spill coffee on herself and blame it on McDonald's because the coffee was too hot. Hey genius, don't drink coffee, you drug addict. Caffeine is a drug, I learned that one playing trivial pursuit. Or better yet, you can drink as much coffee as you want just be careful and don't spill it on your lap. And she got like 1.2 million dollars for that...all for being dumb. This is America. I guess you can get rich doing anything and that's why people live here. 

Ooooh, finally. Here I am. I'm at the chinese fast food mecca of the world......Panda Express. I already know what I want....2 entree plate with steamed rice, orange chicken and tangy pineapple shrimp. And that's exactly what I order. Would I like to add soup or an egg roll? No, but thanks for asking. I appreciate the offer. I will take a pink lemonade though to quench that thirst of mine. God help you if you forget my fortune cookie. Soy sauce please. Can I have another packet? Awesome, thank you very much. Man, there's too many veggies with this shrimp. If I eat that onion, I'll be sick. Then I'd get to go home. But then I wouldn't get paid for 4 hours of work. There's always a catch. Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.....food is good. The lemonade is even better. It like an orgy in my mouth. Minutes pass and all I can think about is that fortune cookie. It looks so innocent there sitting on my tray. Little does it know that it will be eaten soon. If that cookie really had feelings, I wouldn't eat it. But luckily for me, I get to eat it. The best part is the fortune. I always think that fortunes aren't generic but they probably are. I like to think that some outside force controls the fortunes and you really do get something pertinent to your life. I crack the cookie in half. I smile to myself. ""The near future holds a gift of contentment"". All I have to say is final-fuckin-ly. June blew goats. You could say it was more gay than a bag of dicks. But this is good. This can only mean one thing. Either I'm going to get some money soon or my gal situation will finally come through. Ok, I've been here long enough. 

We move ahead to the walk back to the office. I decide to take Maryland Street back because I want to avoid all the peddlers and solicitors. I turn the corner and there's a homeless man that needs change. I like this guy. There isn't anything more sincere than a homeless person. This guy has seen a lot. Here's $5 brother. NO! God bless you my brother. Now I feel bad. This poor guy can't afford shit. I'm complaining daily because I can't afford to fix the brakes on my car. I complain that I make $480 per week. This guy would love to see that money. I should be more grateful. I'll save the complaining about my job for tomorrow. 

Crap. I thought I could avoid it, but they come out in droves. The environmentalists are back. Not the same crew I ran into on Brand, this bunch is different. I know exactly what to say......Oh, I already donated to your friends on Brand. That oughtta shut them up and it did. Success. They bought it. Holy shit! That opera music, I know where it came from. There is a lady in the median standing with her head phones on belting out opera. She's really good. I like it a lot. Everyone is staring but she doesn't care. I wish I could sing like that. I could be Tony the Tenor istead of Tony the Tiger. Maryland Street is a much more peaceful walk. There's more trees and more shade. There isn't the hustle and bustle of Brand. I can walk the rest of the way uninterrupted. This is how I like it. I'm starting to whistle. 

Still whistling..........

Man, that was much quicker of a walk. I'm back already. Time to get back into that elevator, swipe in and sit in my prison cell for 4 more hours. I know things could be worse. I could be mexican. Oh wait, I am."

"event","Here's something I wrote in my notebook:

I sit here bored and waiting for Rylan to pick me up. I'm about to do something exciting. Tonight I get to pretend that I know aht I'm talking about. I got hired to shoot and light a music video and today is our first meeting. I've been in such a bad mood lately. Yesterday was depression but today was just  being pissed off....anger. I hate everything-my car, my job, my looks, my apartment, my clothes. I failed to tell you that my car got broken into last weekend. Maybe I did tell you and I just don't remember. The fuckers took my stereo and CD's. Lately I can't win. I can't do anything right. My life is one giant shit storm right now and I dont have an umbrella or pooper scooper. Being an adulte seemed like so much more fun about 10 years ago. When I saw Cinderella Man, it gave me hope, it inspired me but the inspiration only lasted a few days. The wind was takedn out of my sails when I gound my car trashed over. I don't know what to do now. I owe rent, I have past due bills and I need to get my car fixed. They say God only gives people what they can handle. Well, I muste be ont tough cookie because the month of June was probably the worst of my life. This feel good though, writing in a notebook. I need to do this more. I saw a commercial for a very pathetic show that grants people wishes. It's sad that we live in a society that only does other people favors or good deeds when the cameras are rolling. But that's the way it is. People don't do things because they feel it in their hearts, they do things because they want others to see how good of a person they are. That's why I like Oprah. She does things behind the scenes too, not just in front of the camera on her show. If there were more people like that around, this world would be awesome. But all people care about is themselves and that's fine. Who the hell am I to judge them? I'm just a nobody anyway."

"event","All I can say is wow. I have a cousin that's 3 years younger than me and last week he had his first child. Well, he didn't really have it. His girlfriend did. That would be pretty hard for a guy to have a kid, technology hasn't reached that point yet. I wouldn't be surprised to see it one day though. I had a pretty good week. Work was work, it sucked. I saw a great movie...Cinderella Man.....first movie to make me cry halfway through it. I also saw a sneak peek of a terrible movie called Flightplan. Don't see it. It was terrible. Nate had a few friends in town this week and the other night we went to the strip club....that was interesting to say the least. Last night I got drunk in Hermosa and I'm going back there tonight to probably get drunk again. Other than that, its been the same old shit. I'll keep this one nice and short since I've been criticized many a time of writing too long of messages."

"event","I said a lot of crazy things yesterday but eventually calmed the hell down. After I said all that stuff, good things started happening to me. I called Bria to hang out and she sounded like she really wanted to hang out. Right now I feel great. This is the best I've felt in a long time. I know that's gonna change tomorrow when I go into work but since 7pm last night I've felt great. I made plans to meet up with Bria around 10pm but I drove down to Hermosa around 7pm because Troy was having a handful of people over for a poker tournament. I knew I was gonna do shitty because I've only really played poker like 4 times but I always used to watch it on TV. Well, long story short, I won last night. I won almost $100. Troy made his garage into a total lounge area. He has 2 arcade games and a poker table  in there. Its not as cool as their last garage that had just about everything, but it looks nice and I anticipate many poker night in the future. I was shocked that I won but it felt really good. The people I played with have all been playing for a while and said I'm pretty damn good for a beginner. They said they kept trying to read me all night but they couldn't. Maybe I'm good at it because I know how to fool people.....in a good way. I've watched enough poker to know what the tells are. And I'd just act nervous with my chips or just have a really stern face when I play and that does the trick for me. I have to work on my head's up game though. I had an empire of chips at one point and it was Troy and I at the end and I nearly gave up my huge lead but then the God's smiled upon me and let me win. I kinda don't understand why people think poker is a skill game. Any dummy can tell you when you have good cards to play. Its all about luck. The only skill I can see is understanding how many cards are in the deck and what's been dealt and what your odds are. But that has nothing to do with natural skill. That's called mathematics. Luckily I'm quite the mathematician...or at least I used to be. I don't know though. The last IQ test I took said I was dumber than I was in high school. I'm still upset about it for some reason. Maybe its because I know I can do better. I know I got a 124 on my last test which isn't bad at all.....I just wanted to exceed the 130 I got out of high school. But today is a good day and I'll concentrate on that. Oh yeah.....forgot to finish up about last night. 

After my big poker win, it was time to meet up with Bria. I literally stumbled over to the bar......I drank a tad too much while playing poker. There was a huge line at the bar and I didn't feel like waiting a half hour. So I called her cuz she was inside and I told her to come get me. So she came out and explained to the bouncers what the deal was and because she's cute, they let me in. I hate all the Doumosa's at the bars. Oh, I guess I should clarify what a Doumosa is. A Doumosa is a term RC and I made up for guys that think they're so cool and impressive. These are usually the muscle bound guys that know how to pick up girls and get rid of them in 10 minutes. Ladies, you know the type because most of you fall for their crap. Well the derivation of the word Dumosa is from the Old English times. We simply combined the words Douche and Hermosa and there you have it....Doumosa. A Doumosa is a douche bag of Hermosa. This term can go with any other douche in any other city. For example, a Doucago is a douche bag of Chicago. I think you get the point. Anywho, I got into the bar and we sat with her and her roomies for a while and she wanted to show me her new place so I took her and Angela home. Her house is so awesome. Its so huge and really cheap for being in a beach town. I told her I was jealous. We stayed up for a few hours and just talked for a while. The next morning we continued our conversation and just chilled out for a while before I left back to my hell that is Burbank. 

Then I had to meet up with Rylan because we had to discuss this music video he hired me for. I'm actually gonna DP it!!!! I'm so pumped. This is my chance to do what I want to do....to prove to myself that I can do it. I know I can do it, but its going to be something else to actually be able to go out there, do my thing, work my lil behind off and light and film everything. It'll be cool, that's for sure. The song we're doing is pretty cool I guess. Music videos have been pumping in my veins for the past 2 weeks. There's a bunch of them on iTunes which I just watched and I'm inspired again. I watched my Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry dvd's for ideas, but nothing really struck. But now that I have a copy of the CD, it'll be a lot easier to brainstorm and think of cool ideas. The best thing about a music video is it doesn't have to make sense. Movies have a beginning middle and end with a character arc and things change, people change. But a music video can be a mouse eating cheese on a bed and it would make sense. 

And then there's some music I'm into. Obviously the new White Stripes is great. They will become my favorite band over time and more records. I'm going to see them at the Greek Theater in August. Then the new Coldplay is quite impressive. I don't think its as good as A Rush of Blood to the Head, but I think some of the individual songs on X&Y are so damn good.....particularly the songs ""Fix You"" and ""Kingdom Come"". I think ""Fix You"" is a song that I relate to and its a beautiful song. The lyrics remind me of my thoughts from when I got dumped. ""Fix You"" relates to my life like Eternal Sunshine did.....its just me. And right now I'm listening to Sufjan Stevens. I'm finally getting to import a lot of songs from Nate's collection that I've wanted to import into my iTunes. I need to still import the new Jack Johnson and some Sigur Ros and Radiohead. 

Just now I looked up the Cubs score and it wasn't a good trip out east to NY. They got swept by the Yankees. I hate the Yankees. People say I write too much on here. Well, if you've made it this far on this message, I really appreciate it and I'll stop right now.......just for you. Have a good night."

"event","Yes. I know what it is!  I'm sitting here just staring at the ceiling (or at least I was) and it came to me. I feel like I'm going in reverse and everyone else around me is in the fast lane moving ahead. Dave and Amanda are engaged. Adam is engaged now. Speaking of which, I have a bachelor party to plan......I'm the best man. That just hit me. Adam is getting married. My best friend from high school is all grown up. He was the last one I thought would get married out of my circle of friends. He's getting married in Vegas though.....poor me. I have to plan a bachelor party in Vegas. I wonder if there's anything to do there for someone single in their ealry 20's. I'll have to think about that one. 

But back to my point......everyone is just going on with life. Everyone always thinks that I've got things figured out. I think I have my outlook on life figured out. Now I just need to live it. I guess I could also use some good luck but it just hasn't happened that way yet. I want a girlfriend. I miss it. I've been doing the single and mingling thing for quite some time now and its old. 

I have to put myself back in the driver's seat of life. I've been a passenger for a while. I've been drifting from place to place wondering what's gonna happen next. I have to make every opportunity happen. Things just don't happen on their own. What am I waiting for? Why am I so afraid of my potential? I've heard numerous times that my brain is too big for every place. But I don't believe that. But if so many other people believe it, why can't I? I haven't written a full lenght script because I'm scared. I'm scared of the outcome. If money is the only problem I face right now, why aren't I out doing what I know is right? Why am I afraid is what I'm asking. This is America. You can get rich being stupid. You can get rich being lazy. You can get rich buying things at garage sales and selling it for twice the cost on ebay. Look at ebay......that's a lazy, anti-social way of shopping. And the guy who thought of it is rich. Look at Jared from Subway. Although he's died down, all he was was a fat guy with a will to lose weight. And he got rich off of it. All you need is a spark, an interest in something that nobody would think of.....example: the guy that patented bubble wrap. He's one rich mofo right now. I'm only 2 steps away from total happiness......step one is gonna be finding a girl that loves me before I do something great....then the fun begins. This entry is crazy. I sound like a mad man. But I am a mad man. I'm being honest with myself. 

Its stupid wasting my time at a law firm. Everything comes so damn easy to me. I've been floating through life not reaching my potential because I'm scared. I don't want to release my brain on the world, but now I need to. Dumb, dumb, dumb is how I feel. This feels good though. This is a spark. Now I just need some logs and some gasoline to throw on the fire and I'll be set. Sitting at my cubicle at work has made me realize what I'm in this world for. I'm here to entertain. I'm hear to visualize. I'm not here to clock in, be a robot and type information into a computer. I'm here to make people laugh, cry, yell, puke (ok, maybe not puke), but you get the point. Its time to entertain again. This girl, this magical girl I speak of......I'll find soon. It could be someone I know, it could not. But something is gonna happen soon. I can feel that. 

On a lighter note, I forgot to mention that I saw Batman the other night. It was so good. I'm so very glad they started the franchise over with a good director. Christian Bale is perfect along with the rest of the cast. They're sticking to the comic book. Batman was always my favorite superhero and it was nostalgic sitting in that theater the other night with Nathan. I learned something about myself too. When I love a movie, I just sit. I'm a statue. I didn't move once during that film. My eyes were locked. It felt like I was the only one there watching the movie. Like Christopher Nolan made this film for me. That's how I felt when I watched Eternal Sunshine for the first time in theaters. I think that was really made for me by some higher power. If you experienced what I did at the time, you'd know. Batman is just so good though. I have to go.....i have to get to the bank before it closes."

"event","I celebrated my 23rd birthday on the 15th. It was pretty damn good. I've gotta hand it to my friends here.....they know me. Its amazing how cool my friends here in LA are. I've become better friends with them than most of my friends back home. I guess that happens though when you move on through life and your friends are doing the exact same things they've been doing since high school. Nate organized a whole dinner for me. It was a small crowd of all the people that are closest to me (minus RC and Troy because they went to see Batman Begins instead). We went to this restaurant I've never been to before but that's the beauty of it.....it was new.....fresh....I had no idea where we were going. I thought they were gonna take me to Hooters, which would've sucked because their food isn't good at all. We went to this cajun restaurant and it was absolutely fantastic. I had blackened swordfish and it was to die for. Their gumbo was damn good too. I'm gonna have to hit that place up again. I got a little tipsy on a few drinks, but I'm allowed to because it was my birthday. Even the pianist at the restaurant sang happy birthday to me. After dinner we came back to my house and there was a plethorah of booze awaiting us. Nate, Ryan and I got pretty drunk while Summer, Amanda, Dave and Bria had to take it easy because of work......but that didn't stop me. It was my birthday. It was a fun time, definitely better than last year. I think last year was the worst birthday. This year my friends even bought me presents!!! I think I like the cards the most though because you get some interaction that you don't normally get to have with your close friends. Summer gave me a heart to heart card that meant a lot to me.....so did Amanda. Dave was silly old Dave. Here's Dave's message: ""What can I say? Rock out with your cock out."" That's perfect. Short, sweet and to the point. 

Right now I'm listening to the new Coldplay and its just as I expected.....great! This will be the first chance I get to listen to it from start to finish and that excites me. Speaking of great musical groups......The White Stripes are coming here in August. Tickets are only $45.....ok, tickets are $45!!! That would be the most I've ever paid for a concert but it'll be worth it. I've never seen any of my favorite bands in concert. The only problem is I might have to go by myself because I don't really know anyone that's into the White Stripes that lives here in SoCal. I'm sure I can find someone though. 

Last night I had a revelation.....again. I think that no matter what I do, I won't be happy. I'm already sick of my job. I thought the point of a job was to make you happy, but apparently that isn't the case. I don't know anyone that really likes their job. I'm sure if I was Steven Spielberg I'd enjoy it immensely, but I'm not. I'm Tony Garcia....a hollywood nobody. That reminds me of something I read in a book.......""To the world she was nobody, but to me she meant the world""...... I just look at my last month and I'm amazed. It was a rollercoaster ride. But that's what life is. This sounds dumb but I never realized the power of money. I know it exists and how the economy works, but I never realized the power of it. Everything is money. Just about every important decision made is about money. I can't wait to get out of this money funk I'm in. Mentally I'm stable. I think negatively sometimes but if you had the month I had, you wouldn't be too happy with the higher powers either. Right now I have to get through this minor fork in the road. I have to get back into production ASAP but I have a good plan in the meantime. I have to get back on my feet with my robot job. Then once that's over, Hollywood is mine."

"event","Last friday I finally quit my production job. I couldn't take it anymore at that place. I'm going to be back in production someday and I'm hoping that day is sometime soon. But right now I have to do what's right for Tony, which is me, and right now money is more important than my passion for being in the film industry. So I have a new job now. I work for a company called Atkinson-Baker Court Reporters. This is definitely the most weird place I've ever worked. First of all its run by Scientologists so their policies are pretty weird. My job interview went very well. First I sat and talked with the hiring supervisor named Mark and he really liked me. I showed him a bit of my humor but I was still professional about it. Then I took these weird tests. I guess they use these tests to screen out the dummies. I took an aptitude test, typing test, personality test and IQ test....it took forever to do but it was pretty fun. I got my results back right away which was nice. I've taken these tests before. I was most impressed with my typing test because I can type 75 words/minute which I hear is good. I guess all this time being online is paying off somehow. I was quite upset with my IQ test though. I took one right after high school ended because I thought it would be fun to know my IQ. I always thought I was pretty smart and it turns out I was. I got a 130 back in high school but my test this time wasn't as good. I got a 124. I was so mad and Mark was surprised at how visibly upset I was. But once he got the results from my personality test, he knew what my deal was right away. They called me in the next day for a second interview because the CEO of the company wanted to meet me. So I met him and he liked me too and told me they didn't have any openings.....but for the right person (he pointed at me while saying that) they would make a position. So they made a position for me at the company. They said they fell lucky to have a young man of my talents there. I don't know what that means. I don't take compliments very well. So long story kinda short I'm the new Client Database Supervisor. I'm already someone's boss. I'm the boss of many people actually. The older crowd there has got to hate me. Imagine a young 22 year old punk coming into your parents office and taking the job they were hoping to get promoted to....all because I took a few tests and showed a little personality at my interview. Not to mention, I get full benefits in 3 months which is awesome. Now, as good as all this sounds, I HATE IT! I always told myself I'd never get a regular 9-5 job. I knew it would be easy to find one, but I didn't know how much I'd really hate it. I'm still in my training and I know my job is gonna suck. My job is so easy. I sit in my cubicle all day and type in changes of address of clients that we have. That's my job and I hate it. Why can't I just be happy that I have a job. There's many people out there that can't find anything and my problem is I'm too picky. I don't care how much money I make. I'd rather be struggling a little and do something I love than to be well off and do something I can't stand. So now I begin my life as a robot. I wake up at the same time....arrive at the same time.....breaks are scheduled......lunch is scheduled......clock out time is scheduled. They train you to be a robot there and just live everything by a set schedule. I just hate it. I sit in my five by five cubicle prison every day with my shirt and tie and slacks and fake everything is ok just like everyone else around me does. Everyone arrives at the same time, everyone leaves at the same time. You can't come in early or leave late. You have to clock out at 5:30. You have to get permission to get paid overtime. We do these monotonous jobs every day of our lives because we need to get by....pay rent, eat and have the small things in life that mean everything. I have to come up with a new plan.  A plan that can get me back in the industry full time. The only reason I'm staying at this place right now is because I want the benefits. I haven't been to a doctor or dentist in a very long time. I know there's ways to go to the doctor without having to have benefits from a job, but I can't afford that at all. So I have to think of a plan....something new, something fresh that I can call my plan again. I'm loving the free time I get to write with this job, but its not worth the pain knowing that I'm gonna be a robot soon. Soon I'm not gonna need a shower, I'll need oil for my legs and arms. I'll need some screws for my brain. It just isn't fun and its not what I expected at all. I thought it would be easy. Well, it is easy if you can handle being in a cubicle prison for 8 hours a day. I'm not that tough obviously...or I just complain a lot. But if I didn't complain about it, I wouldn't have something to complain about so I'm taking the time out of your day and my day to complain. Time to think about my choices again. I know of one thing I can definitely do, but I said I'd never stoop that low. I always said no matter what I can't do that! But even now ""that"" is sounding pretty damn good. 

I was in Hermosa all weekend which  you'll hear about in a couple paragraphs and it was one of the best weekends I've had in a while. On saturday when we were walking back to RC's from volleyball at the beach, we saw someone very familiar....someone we couldn't believe was there 2 feet away from us in normal street clothes just walking with a girl.....someone we all idolize and love.....Quentin Tarantino walked right past us. It was a surreal moment. All of us are (or were) in the film industry and aspire to be in the film industry and here comes good old Quentin just strolling down the road. We didn't say anything to him. We're too calm and collected to say anything to anyone famous.....they're just people. If a stranger saw me walking down the street, would he ask me for an autograph or a picture. They might just say hi and walk away. All night I thought about how I saw Quentin Tarantino and didn't say anything to him. If I had the moment over again, if I could press the rewind button on life, I'd just say......""excuse me, Quentin....but thank you."" That's it. That's all I'd say to him. I wouldn't have any other topic to talk about with him. His brain is so far ahead of mine, him talking to me would just make me more dumb. I wish I could have that moment back just to say thank you. But I don't have it and probably will never have it again, but it was good while it lasted. 

And literally 15 minutes before we saw Quentin, we were playing volleyball and enjoying ourselves. Well, as we were finishing up our volleyball game, we saw 2 more famous people. Well not really famous, but famous enough. Ryan Dunn and Wee Man from Jackass were chillin' and riding their bikes down the path and yelling shit at people. I didn't really care to meet them though. It was cool just being able to see them ride away. Wee Man is funny.

Then the rest of the weekend was really good. I have no complaints whatsoever. There's this girl Bria that gave me her # on set on my last shoot and I ended up calling her up and we kinda mixed my group of friends with her group of friends and we all hit it off. This was one of the more fun weekends I've had in California. And I've been here a year now. The 12th was my one year anniversary I guess you can say. There was a large party at Bria's friends house in Redondo Beach and we went there on saturday and I didn't end up leaving that place until 430am. Time flies when you're having fun. People are telling me that Bria has the hot's for me but I'm not buying into it. Nate invited her to my birthday dinner tomorrow night and he said she was really excited to go. Nothing is gonna happen though between us. I don't want it to at this point. I just want to be her friend. But all in all it was a good weekend. I hope to have another good weekend this week. I'd like to celebrate my birthday, but most of my good friends will be out of town so that plan is probably gonna be shot. I'll have another bad birthday. I always do and I don't really care. I don't want to celebrate being older. 23 is nothing to be proud of. It just means I'll have more responsibilities soon that I can, but don't want to handle. Its all part of growing up though and I'm ready for whatever comes my way."

"event","***Ok, I wrote this out in my real notebook because I felt like it. But nonetheless, here's my entry for now. My fuckin' arm hurts from writing.***

Wow, this is different for a change. Pen on paper. Its good to be back to the old school way. I like this much better than the damn computer. I can look back at this and know my own writing. ""Writing"" on the computer is so lame but so convenient so I do it. Plus I have some good friends that read my online journal and give their 2 cents. I started the day off so very creatively but creativity took a back seat to money issues which took a back seat to stress which has taken a back seat to loneliness. I've had to tell the story about 634 times today so I don't feel like going over it again in detail. The basic story is I owe a small fortune to the great state of California. I don't know how or why things like this happen to me. I'm a good, genuine person. I was brought up being told that if I'm a good person good things would come to me. I can list off 10 things right now I've done in the past 48 hours for people that I didn't have to do but did because I love being nice. I love helping people out. The problem is I can't help myself. I didn't even make a mistake this time. Today was my shit luck kicking in. How am I supposed to learn from a mistake I didn't make? All I did today was woke up and breathed some air repeatedly like I normally do. But this bad luck shit has to stop. Just when I think I'm getting ahead of the game, some crap comes out of left field and hits me in the side of the face...and it hurts. And it happens every time I'm about to get ahead. Just when I devise a plan it gets shot to shit. But there's no point in complaining about it. I wish I had nothing to complain about....but then what would I complain about??? What would I write about??? My writing would be boring. It would be the same old.....woke up, went to work, it sucked, came home, talked online, went to bed......that's what my life boils down to right now. But like I said right now isn't the time to complain, its the time to be positive and look forward and realize it can't get much worse than this. I'm alive, I'm breathing and there's a roof over my head and that's all I need. There's even food in the cupboard if I want some.

New paragraph. I want to talk about Katy. I know that she reads my journal, but I'm not gonna lie or censor anything I have to say. I guess I could choose to omit this from my online journal but that's not cool. That wouldn't be honest. Back to Katy...We met online, still haven't met in person. But she means a lot to me. I've been dating a lot lately but since talking to her I've wanted to stop. Is it possible to have feelings for someone that you haven't physically met yet??? Could online dating be the purest form of getting to know someone??? It sounds weird but think about it. You're talking to another person and you can't base your feelings on physical features. You know their words and you learn their tendencies. You take in so much of this person without seeing them and you can grow attached. Maybe its just me. Do you know what I'm saying though? You can't judge this person or have a skewed opinion about them until you meet them. You can fall in love with all the things that make love magical, all the right things about that person. I'm not saying I'm in love, but I am interested enough in her that I want to explore that possibility if it ever came down to it. She's so great. I made her a CD tonight and I'm gonna write her a letter. I talked to her and just talking to her made me feel a hell of a lot better. It made me feel amazing, like I was worth something to someone. I think she's beautiful. I have seen pictures of her and she's good looking. Very cute. Her brain and her kindness are what do it for me though. And we click. We get each other. We see eye to eye. She says her cute ""lol""s and ""mmk""s all the time and I love it. I even like the way she spells her name.....Katy. I think she even digs my humor. Not many people get my humor but she does. She doesn't think I'm weird. She accepts it and goes with it. I could go on for hours but my hand is tired. I'm so excited for her. But for now I have to sit and wait and see. I have a good feeling about her though. I think about her a lot and maybe I shouldn't be saying all this stuff because it could scare her. That's the last thing this guy wants. I have to stop right now......and I did. Good job Tony!"

"event","I took the day off of work today because I need to get a lot of shit done. I woke up at 830am and now its almost 930. I'm waiting for the carpet people to call me so I can let them in downstairs. I'm in one of those moods again. I don't know what one of those moods really is, but I'm in it. I feel creative today and when I do, I usually have good days. We'll see how it goes.........

She shivers in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree. I let her hear my footsteps. She only goes stiff for a moment. ""Care for a smoke?"" 

""Sure. I'll take one. Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?""

""I didn't come here for the party. I came here for you. I've watched you for days. You're everything a man could ever want. Its not just your face...your figure...or your voice. Its your eyes. All the things I see in your eyes.""

""What is it you see in my eyes?""

""I see a crazy calm. You're sick of running. You're ready to face what you have to face....but you don't want to face it alone.""

""No. I don't want to face it alone.""

The wind rises electric. She's soft and warm and almost weightless. Her perfume is sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes. I tell her that everything will be alright. That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far, far away. I tell her...I love her. 

[There's a gunshot muffled by a silencer]

The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot. I hold her close until she's gone. I'll never know what she was running from........I'll cash her check in the morning.

BLOODY BRILLIANT! That's all for now. I have a feeling today is gonna be a good day with multiple posts."

"event","Porn-So we started filming our re-enactments for our John Dillinger documentary on thursday. I knew it was going to be an interesting shoot because we were filming day one at the Entertainium which just so happens to be the world's largest porn studio. This place was pretty creepy. You walk in and you walk upstairs to the second floor and once you walk through the doors, you know of the things that've gone down there. And this place is huge. Its an entire second floor of a warehouse building in east LA. It has all the classic porn sets....a Dr.'s office, classroom, multiple bedrooms, a mirrored maze room (which was actually pretty cool), a bar/club, locker room, showers, pool room....I could go on, but I'm done thinking. It was even more interesting when some of the ""actresses"" started showing up to hang out on set. They weren't filming anything but they definitely hung out a little bit. On our location scout they were definitely filming stuff and there were girls and guys walking around in robes all day. It was kinda creepy. The day itself wasn't so bad though. I wasn't really overworked for the first time in my Morningstar career....that was until yesterday and probably today/tonight. Last night I worked from 9am-1am and today i'll be working probably from 3pm-6am sunday....that's just how it is I guess. I've come to the conclusion that I just have to toughen up and pay my dues so I can climb the ladder in the film biz. I'm not going to quit my job until I find another industry job. But once I do I will leave Morningstar with so much glee, but until then I'll be miserable with my job.

A Dickhead-There was one incident I had on set that I was very furious about. Our second unit DP needed a light set up and he sent someone (I don't know who) to get the light. So they got the light and set it up while I was setting up craft services. So a few minutes later I go over to set and our grip/electric guy comes into the room and sees the light set up and I happened to be the one standing closest to it and he flips out at me. He says ""You don't touch this light! You don't know how to use it! Why the fuck are you touching my lights? Don't ever touch my lights again."" Its my job to keep my cool and not say anything back because I'm a PA. I'm supposed to take the blame and just be cool. So I did. I just stood there and smiled and I think that pissed him off even more because he then told me he was going to get the UPM to fire my ass. Little does dickhead know that my job is safer than his because I'm a full time Morningstar employee. So he gets the UPM who happens to be one of the cooler guys at my work and he comes over to me and asks what's wrong. I tell him the situation, we have a good laugh and he tells me to not worry about and thanks me for keeping my cool. I walk out of our little meeting with a shit eating grin on my face and the grip/electric is stunned that I'm not fired. So later he asks me ""what the fuck are you doing here? You're gone!"" I just ignored him. I didn't acknowledge his existence and this time the UPM was standing right there when this happened. The guy was so pissed at me. I don't think I've ever pissed anyone off that much. I didn't know I was capable of pissing someone off that much. It was so damn funny. People all around me started laughing once the guy left. It was a good time. Today he'll be there and I can't wait for round 2 of fun. I talked to Mike (the UPM) last night and he said if he says something to me, I shouldn't ignore him this time and he said to say something funny to him...so I think whenever he asks me something, I'm just gonna say something random back. I haven't decided yet though....we'll see.

I still don't know what I'm gonna do with my car. I haven't gotten it fixed because I'm broke as a joke. But I'm thinking about getting the brakes fixed and then selling my car and using the money I make from my car combined with some money from my next few paychecks and go get that Saturn ION I've been eyeing up. I don't want to talk to my parents about it because they always talk me out of it....and this time I know what's right. So that's what I'm gonna do. Do you know anyone that needs a Honda CRX with 75K miles with brand new brakes??? Let me know. If not, craigslist here I come! Peace out."

"event","So today was to be the day that I gave Adam the grand tour of Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. We're guys so we can do all three in one day. Well I was on my way to drive past Ozzy Osbourne's house when all of a sudden I heard a snap underneath my car. I thought something was going to fall off my car so I quickly looked in my mirrors to see if anything fell......but nothing did. So I get to the stop sign and I step on my brakes......and step on my brakes.......and step on my brakes again and nothing happens. It then registered in my head that my brakes had snapped. Luckily I was on a side street when this happened so there wasn't a lot of traffic around. But just 10 minutes earlier I was on Sunset and it was pretty crowded and someone, including myself could've died. And just 15 minutes before that I was up on Mulholland Drive. That could've been really bad. I can see my car flying off a cliff...what a way to go. So that set me back $200 just to get my car towed from Beverly Hills to Burbank. That doesn't even include the price of my repairs. I'm pretty broke right now so I might be without my car for a little while. I would rather be in debt and struggle for a little while than be dead. So I get to live another day to tell another story. 

Tonight was much better. I went to the Cubs/Dodgers game with Adam and we had so much fun. I wore my Cubs jersey with pride and they ended up winning tonight. Carlos Zambrano was damn near perfect. He threw a one hitter and the one hit was a bloop single that probably could've been caught. The Cubs ended up winning in the 10th inning. Then I went home happy. The Dodger fans were pretty tough on me though. I took a lot of crap, but I dished it out a bunch in the end. I love trash talk. I think part of me missing sports is all the trash talk I used to do. I am the BIGGEST talker of them all. Its part of sports and I love it. And that's all I have to say about that. 

The rest of my long weekend was good. However, I don't look forward to work on Thursday. Its gonna be a long day on set for our John Dillinger shoot. But at least I won't be in the office. I guess I should start worrying about my car soon. This is the wrong time for this to happen, but I'll deal with it and get through it cuz I'm tougher than a zebra."

"event","Alrighty......Adam has finally come out to LA to visit me. I picked him up yesterday afternoon from LAX and our day started there. We came back to my place and he met my roommates and we watched Wet Hot American Summer. That sounds like a porno name but its totally not. Its actually a really funny movie. And last night was crazy. I got REALLY drunk. We drove down to Hermosa Beach and went over to RC's house where I drank 2 beers to wet my pallette. Then it was off the Hennessey's to meet up with Summer and her 2 friends......Andrea and I forget the other girls name. But that's where the fun really began. I downed 4 jager bombs and 4 Fosters and I was hammered. I don't have a high tolerance to begin with. After about 3 beers I feel buzzed. But after Hennessey's we went to another bar and didn't stay there very long so I was only able to down one beer. Then we all went back to RC's to chill out and wind down the evening. But why wind the evening?? So I continued drinking a few more beers. Looking back at it, its pretty sickening, but I had a great time. I've been cutting back on drinking lately which I'm proud of, but last night there was reason to celebrate because Adam was here. 

But on the walk to RC's I might have dropped the ball. Ok.....I definitely dropped the ball. Adam and I were walking down the street and there were 2 girls in front of us. They must've heard the clinking of the Rolling Rock bottles or something (or they thought we were cute....doubtful) because they turned around and asked us if we were going to a party. Now, most guys in this situation would know what to do...but not this guy *points to self*. I said and I quote, ""No. We're just pre-gaming."" Wow, how stupid did that sound? I could've said, ""not really a party but a small get together then we're going out to the bar if you guys wanna join us."" I think that would've been a lot better. But I think I came off like I was trying to get rid of them or I didn't want to talk to them or something. Well, its ok either way because I don't care. I just think what I said was funny. 

And even before any of this happened...even before I picked up Adam from the airport, the weekend started kinda rocky. I was in the shower and I hear a series of knocks on the bathroom door. I thought maybe someone had to drop a major deuce or something so I tell them one minute and finish washing really quick. It was Joanne's sister from downstairs. It turns out there was a plumbing problem and all the water that was going down the drain was going down into Joanne's sisters apartment. So the plumbers showed up and it turns out a pipe burst underneath the house. So the plumbers have to come in and drill through the floor and replace the pipe. The kicker is this is a holiday weekend and possibly the worst time this can happen. There aren't any plumbers available with the proper tools to fix this problem...or so they say. So now I'm without water until at least tuesday. The good part is the landlord is going to be putting us up in a hotel while the problem is getting taken care of. Crap, I just realized I have tons of laundry to do......and now I have to pee. Dammit! 

Another weird thing just happened today too. I just got a call from Meg. Yes, the same Meg that ripped my heart out, spit on it, kicked it around a little bit and ran it over with her car. We talked for about an hour and it was a good talk. I'm glad I'm back to the point of being civil with her. I used to get upset at the sound of her voice. I used to think about all the good times. But now its different. Now I don't have to worry about what she says because it doesn't phase me. I'm over her and ready for someone else. Before when we talked I always had this shred of hope that still existed. I always thought she was going to turn it around and realize she made a mistake. But after today I felt none of that. No hope. No thoughts about our past together. No want. No need.....just talk with someone that shared a big part of my life with me. I feel so good right now because of it. 

And now its 3 to 11 and its time to get the day started....except Adam is still sleeping. Lazy bastard. Maybe I'll get cabinet (my cat) in here to wake him up. Sounds like a plan."

"event","Another day, another dollar. I hate work. I ran around all day and didn't even have enough time for my lunch break. Does anyone care? No, not at my work. They barely know I exist. Its getting to the point where I'm just gonna quit out of the blue and just not care. I'm also starting to miss home a little. I plan on going back in July sometime....probably around my mom's and bro's birthday. Next week we have the John Dillinger shoot......yipeee! I bet you can sense the sarcasm across the computer screen. Joanne brought me home an application for her work. So my opportunity to leave my work is here right now. I have to decide what I'm gonna do. I would like to stay within the industry but that might now be possible right now. But like I said or thought to myself before....a break from the industry might be exactly what I need. 

I've been downloading and watching a lot of music videos lately. I would love to make a living out of directing videos. I have a few good ideas for scripts that I'm ready to work on. One of them is the story of my life....I know, how egotistical....but my life is an interesting story. I've seen a lot. I've done a lot. I usually don't like sharing my movie ideas on public forums, but I can talk about this idea because nobody really knows my story except for my ex-girlfriend and she doesn't hate me enough to steal my ideas. But anway, its gonna be about me and my upbringing.....without a father, living in a rough city, being around gang life as a child. As the movie moves along so does my life. The longer it goes on, the older I get. I want to use the basic 3 act paradigm....1st act-young child, 2nd act-my move out to the suburbs and out of harms way (age 12-18), 3rd act-now......sounds kinda boring when I say it that way but it'll be good.

My other idea is an idea I've been developing and researching since last June. All I'm gonna say is it'll be structured like Magnolia and it involves the social classes of America. It'll be a tough one to tackle but I'll do it.

I'm really involved in reading all of a sudden. This book I'm reading now called Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk is great. Its really dark but really funny and interesting at the same time. I haven't read anything like his stuff and that's why  I like him. Then again, I haven't read much of anything so I wouldn't know who writes like him. 

I'm gettin' lonely, oh, so lonely here in this crazy city. Tomorrow will suck. At least I was able to do some laundry tonight. I've been needing to do that for like a week now and finally got around to it. I've been just going out to the store and buying new clothes because I haven't had time to do laundry. This cran cherry juice I'm drinking is really good. My bed looks pretty appetizing right now. I just washed the sheets and the pillows are fluffed and ready to be laid on. The rest of my room is a pig sty but eh, who has time to clean these days?"

"event","There once was a man with green shoes and yellow stockings. This man liked to eat catfish, but on this particular day he was going to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. In the spring time something happened to this man that changed him forever. He was walking down the street and got hit by a bus.....but he didn't die. He wanted to die but couldn't explain why he didn't. Maybe it wasn't his time to go. Maybe (G)god wanted him to suffer the rest of his days on Earth. He sat in his hospital bed with 2 broken legs, 9 broken ribs and a fractured spine. He was paralyzed.....a cripple.....a vegetable. He'll never walk or form another original thought again. His family...gone. Not because they don't love him or they aren't there for him, but because he doesn't remember them. His brain is lost and is never coming back. He would think of a clever way to take his own life if only he could form a thought. But instead he just sits....waiting......thinking......hoping........breathing.....dying. One day he'll wake up and look around and things will make sense. Too bad that's the day he dies.

Ok......and welcome to my brain. No, I'm not drunk or high or on anything except life. Sometimes I like to write random stories and that was one of them. Its pretty dark I guess, but that's just what I write. I write comedy and dark drama. I just woke up a few minutes ago and realized I haven't written here in a while. I'm writing again for a couple of reasons. A) I like to write. I like online journals. It keeps me fresh and when I don't have someone to vent to, the old online journal is always there. B) I finally have my internet up at my new place. Oh, I moved by the way. I now live a whole 4 blocks from my old residence. I have new roommates and its a great place to live. C) There are people that read my journal that I haven't spoken to in a long time.....HI! I'm Tony, remember me? Sorry I've been gone for so long, but I'm back. D) I have nothing better to do at this moment of my day. I was supposed to go play hockey at that park in Burbank with some guys I met last week, but my gear is in my garage locked up and I don't know the code to the lock and Ryan and Nate are sleeping on my floor and I don't want to wake them up. 

I guess nothing has really changed in the last month or however long its been. I HATE (yes, all capitals) my job and this hot weather we're having. I'm not built for my job or the weather. Every day I think of ways to get out of work. Its actually come to the point where I'm just not showing up or calling in on random days so that they can fire me. I have a few job prospects right now and to be honest I'm not worried about getting fired. I don't want to quit because if I quit I can't collect unemployment. Lately I've been thinking I want to write scripts for a living. I know I've always wanted to be a writer, but now its more apparent than ever. Here's a list of reasons why I hate my job.....A)I don't get paid enough. B)The people there are all pompous pricks that should be charged with murder for the way they treat their employees. C) I work overtime, but don't get paid overtime. D) Its a dead end for me. I can't advance into a position that I want and me working there is just a waste of my time. E) Its just time for a change. I've been there almost 9 months now and my views of the place haven't changed and they aren't going to change. So now I'm just going around trying to get fired and that's that. I think my time might come next week because I told them (my bosses) today that I can't work on our next shoot. I told them it was a family emergency but in reality I have a friend coming into town. 

That's all for now. My guitar is calling me. I'm getting pretty good now.....well not pretty good, but good enough by my low standards. I won't be happy though til I'm as good as Jack White or or Robert Plant"

"event","So I took another hiatus, but I'm back. I really didn't go anywhere....I had a pretty frustrating week. It wasn't work and it wasn't girls (for once), but it was sports. People don't really understand what sports mean to me so I should try to at least explain so people see why I get so upset about it. You'll probably think I'm really weird once you read this, but that's ok with me...I can live with that. 

I have to start from the beginning in order for everyone to understand. My real dad ditched out on my family when I was 5 years old. I was still pretty young, but I've always been smart enough to realize exactly what's going on. I guess you can say I'm a pretty aware person. My dad ended up leaving us when I was 5, but he really wasn't around before that. I don't have many memories with him, but I do know that he was an ass and my whole life I didn't want to be what he was......hence me being a nice guy, always wanting to be loved, always wanting a serious relationship, etc......I don't need a shrink to tell me that I had a fucked up childhood. I know that, and I knew things in my life were going to be different than things in other people's lives. So instead of having a father figure around, I had several father figures. I guess I can break it down, but it'll be pretty long (Britt, you may need to do that nifty little link thingy again cuz I don't know how to do that).

First is my uncle Marty. He's probably been the person closest to a father for me. And this is where my love for sports starts. Uncle Marty was a huge hockey fan. He actually was invited to try out for the 1988 US Olympic team, but didn't end up going because he was too nervous. So I guess you can say the hockey genes run in the family blood and well, I also blew my opportunity to make it big since I couldn't gain weight. Anyway, he had season tickets for the Blackhawks and one day one of his friends couldn't make the game and he invited me. I was only 3 years old and this is one of my first memories ever. The Blackhawks played the Rangers and the game ended in a 2-2 tie. Ever since that day, I was my uncle's hockey buddy. It wasn't just us though....it was his two other friends from high school.....Dave and John. Well, the 4 of us kinda grew up together and by the time I was 5 years old, I could talk hockey. I knew the rules, the teams, the players....everything. And the four of us went to every single Blackhawks home game from 1985-1996...it was amazing. I've been to so many hockey games. So growing up around hockey was kinda my way of bonding with a father figure. So I get my hockey craze from him.

Then there's Uncle Craig. Uncle Craig is sort of the partier. He actually pitched for the Cubs back in the late 70's, but got into a car accident that ultimately ended his career. So when I was 4, he took me to my first Cubs game. Ever since then, I've been hooked on the Cubs. Uncle Craig taught me the inside and outside of baseball....how the game is mostly psychological. He taught me how to pitch and how to play baseball by the percentages....which is why I think I could coach either hockey or baseball. Uncle Craig was also the one to introduce me to partying. He's a big partier himself and he was first in line to take me to the bar when I turned 21. 

And finally there's Uncle Jose. He was the one that was the die hard Bears fan. He idolized Walter Payton. Jose was the spiritual type. He was very emotional and in touch with himself and very aware of what was going on in every situation. When I was little, we used to talk about life. I spent a lot of time at my cousin's (his son) house because my cousin Nick is like a brother to me. But even from a young age I talked about life and right and wrong and I think I learned that all from my uncle Jose. Unfortunately Uncle Jose died of cancer a few years ago. The crazier thing is he died on the same day Walter Payton died and of the same type of cancer.....that's just too crazy to me. He grew up idolizing Walter Payton and dies of the same thing Walter Payton died of....and on the same day......too weird for me. 

So in summary, sports and I go way back. Sports were my outlet when I was frustrated. They mean everything to me and they're the link that binds me to my family. Sports were there for me when nobody else was. So what if I'm a little fanatical about my teams. The reason I had a bad week was because Illinois lost to UNC in the NCAA basketball tournament. I know its only a game, but to me, sports is more than a game. Its life. There's nothing better than participating in a sports league. Even in the crappy men's leagues around town....you just can't beat it. The comraderie that exists in sports is like no other. So that's why I take offense when people tell me its only a game. When it comes down to it, its not life and death, I know that. But sports are more than just a game to me. I can go on forever and ever about this, but I know if I knew someone was passionate about something, lets say guitar playing.......I would never say, hey, its only a hobby. But that's my reasoning for my bad week. I'm back now and in ok shape because the Cubs won in 12 innings today. Does anyone understand my obsession with sports??? Probably not, but I'm ok with that. I know I'm not alone in this. Hopefully when/if I ever find the right girl for me, she'll understand my love for sports. But believe me, my love for a girl will be much greater than my love for sports. I already thought I found my one, but I didn't. She was totally cool with my sports thing and absolutely understood where I was coming from. I need to find someone else like that, but that is beyond my control....time for bed."

"event","I have been watching sports my whole life. This part of March is the time where college basketball reigns supreme over all other sports. I am watching a game between West Virginia and Louisville that is amazing me. West Virginia is a #7 seed and I'm shocked that they've made it this far. Now they are killing Louisville at halftime. I haven't seen a team play a more perfect game. Louisville has the more talented players but WV is just gelling well together. It just shows that sometimes teamwork and strategy can work against pure talent. To see another example of this, look at last year's LA Lakers. Anyway, I was just amazed at the first half of this game and I wanted to comment on it to someone....but since I'm home alone all day watching basketball, I have no one to talk to except my computer. If only I had a dollar for every time I was talking to my computer. The big game isn't until 4:00 though....Illinois vs. Arizona. My mood tonight depends on what happens in that game. GO ILLINI !!!"

"event","Ah yes, another day, another mind changed. Amanda has changed her mind once again with Dave. As I type they are sleeping in the same bed in my old room. Yes, I know....this is like fucking musical bedrooms at my apartment. So Dave moved out of the room we were sharing and is back with Amanda. Nathan and I are in the master bedroom now and couldn't be more happy. I bought a 12 game season ticket package today for the Dodgers......now I just can't wait til May 31 when my Cubbies come into town and beat the crap out of LA. It will be grand. Not much has happend the past few days. Tonight Nathan and I watched True Romance. It was pretty decent. I can't wait to get out of my financial bind that I've been in. I finally am going to be able to turn it around this month and I'm moving into a new place at the end of April so that's exciting. Work is the same old crap. I don't like it at all but I hope to be out of there soon. However, I'm kinda interested in sticking around until at least June because we have some potentially cool shoots coming up, including one in Chicago to film our John Dillinger show. That would be awesome to be able to go back home and shoot stuff. But its a quick entry tonight because I don't really have much to say."

"event","FINALLY! I get to write something. I have had no time between work and friends visiting and now its sunday morning, I'm hung over, sleepy and ready to write about many things. This song I'm listening to right now is a song I wanted to make a music video to a while back when my ex broke up with me. Its a song about a guy receiving a letter in the mail saying the girl he loves is dead. Its by the White Strips and the song is called Death Letter. Anyway.....I just went to the bathroom and walked past my mirror.....all I'll say is, if only I had a digital camera that worked. My hair is everywhere.....I love it, but it needs to get cut.

My friends Nick and Brad were here for about a week. It was Nick's second time visiting me since I moved out here and Brad's first time in California period. I've known Nick forever. Well, not really forever but in friend years its been a long time. I was a freshman in high school when we met which was back in '96 for all you youthful folk. He is my fellow mexican counter part in my group of friends back home. So we kinda have that understanding for each other. Brad I don't know really well. I only hung out with him once or twice before he came out here to visit. He's kind of a fruitcake if you ask me. He's not gay or anything, but I figured fruitcake was a good way to describe him. I don't know though, Brad is basically Nick's friend when Matt and I aren't around to hang out. And well, since Matt and I live in California now, Brad is Nick's new sidekick. So I got to play host for those 2 again. Last time Nick came here he was only here for a weekend with Matt and all we did was drink. It was gross. We'd wake up and drink beer with our eggs. It was 3 days straight of being drunk and nothing to be proud of. This time it was different. There was plenty of being drunk for sure, but not as much as last time. I took them all over the place. We drove through Malibu, did the Santa Monica thing, played volleyball at the beach, watched sports, went hot tubbin', and of course the bars.....it was a good time. I'm pretty sure Nick is going to move out here next year. Its funny how my friends are all following me out here. I was once told by another one of my best friends, Adam, that if I didn't get the group together to do stuff, they'd never leave the house. I think he was right. When I announced I was going to film school in FL to everyone, I could see that they didn't believe me. They always thought that I'd never leave Chicago. I don't think it was until I was packed and leaving that they realized what was going on. Every time I'd talk to one of them back home they said the same thing........same shit, different day. And I think that's the way it is if you're comfortable in your hometown. It wasn't until I moved out that people started doing shit with their lives. I don't think I'm responsible for that but I think I might have played the role of 'getting your ass in gear guy'. They all saw I wasn't settling for crap and they all realized what they were capable of and that there's more to the world than LaGrange, IL. But I think the biggest thing is they realized that even though we won't be around our friends forever, they're still our friends regardless. So now Nick is going to pursue what he's always wanted to pursue.......a job where you can work in shorts and a T-shirt. That's seriously his goal in life. Its not a great goal to have but everyone has different goals and he can't work all year in Chicago in shorts and a t-shirt.....but I know of one place where that's possible. I wonder where that is??

Amanda is pissing me off. You all have heard of the great break up of 2005 between her and Dave. Well, last week sunday she pulled me aside and admitted to me she wasn't ready to leave him. This is only days after I moved all my shit into a new room.....a crammed room I might add where I have to sleep with clothes, an old dvd player and a snowboard because I have no room for it anywhere else. So she had a talk with Dave and it looked like things were peachy again in their lives. Dave was set to move out of my room and into hers since I was getting the master bedroom anyway once they moved out. Well, things have changed since then. Amanda decided she doesn't want to be with Dave again and they're back to getting their own places separately from each other. THIS JUST IN.....last night we went to Howl at the Moon (its a kick ass bar, you should go) and they both got really drunk and she was all over Dave at the bar. Then we got home and she got really sick and Dave took care of her. To make a long story short, Dave didn't sleep in his bed last night. I doubt anything went on but the fact that she's leading him on and basically toying with him, doesn't make me happy. I know her mind set now and it makes me mad because she's saying a lot of the things Meg said to me when she dumped me. This will bring me to a new point later on in a different paragraph about girls. I had this epiphony (that's totally not the way to spell it) last night while I observing those two. The funniest thing is I'm not even gonna be living in this apartment anymore at the end of april. It'll be sad to go because I'll miss the hot tub and pool and workout room. But.....and there's always a but.......this new place we're getting is ok. Its a 3 bedroom and its way cheaper than my current place. So that means I'll have more money that I'll be able to save which at this point is a very good thing.....especially since I'm buying a new car in June. I'll be rooming with Amanda, Nathan, Joanne and girl X. Girl X isn't really a clever name, we just don't know who it'll be. But I get along with all of them so it should be interesting. Nathan and I are going to share a room which should be a blast. And like I said, rent is going to be dirt cheap. Basically I can work one week and pay for rent, utilities and bills.....the rest is for saving and fun. 

My search for a new hat has ended. On the very last night Nick and Brad were here, we were in Hermosa Beach and walking around to all the little shops down by the pier and I happened to glance in a store and I saw it staring back at me. Its a trucker hat that's white with red mesh and (here's the kicker that sold me on it) it has mighty mouse on it. It was only 10 bones so I bought it. Its pretty basass. I guess besides Chilly Willy the Penguin, Mighty Mouse would be my second favorite cartoon character. There is a back story there because Meg used to tell me I reminded her of Mighty Mouse when I played hockey. I assume it would have to be because I look small and weak like a mouse but when people see me play hockey, they all say the same thing.......""I can't believe that was you!!! You are like a little fireball going around!!! You don't look like a hockey player, but you're pretty good."" Then I blush and tell them to stop and that's that. But my new hat is found and I wear it with pride!

And now the girl situation. This one's always interesting. I've been trying the online dating thing for quite some time now. I can't say its been disappointing because I've met a lot of cool people and some not so cool people that were good experiences to have in life. There is one flaw in this online system that really sucks. Its not so much the whole not being able to see what the other person really looks like.....or the fact that the first time you're in contact with them is the most false talk you'll ever have....its the fact that there are many people interested in at least meeting you and you don't stop once you meet someone cool. Maybe its just me though. Maybe people really do stop once they meet someone cool......I doubt it though. This past year I've realized that there's more than one person out there for you. You just have to find them. That sounds lame and cliche cuz it is, but its true. I thought Meg was my girl for life. I realized that wasn't the truth this year. Now this leads me to my epiphony from last night.......and this is gonna sound really simple.......I need someone that likes the things that I like. That's all that will make me happy. I've gone on a few dates with this girl I met on myspace and she's 19. I can tell she's into me, she's cool and laid back (sometimes). But I just don't know anymore. I'm starting to think that I need to date someone more my age. Or maybe not date someone more my age, but if I was going to get truly serious with someone, I think they'd need to be over 21 so we can do things together. I was at the bar last night and saw Dave and Amanda and how happy they seemed together (even though they were drunk) and I realized that I can't do things with a lot of the people that I meet online because they're young. That's not a knock on anyone, especially anyone that might be reading this ;-) but that's just where I sit. And another big thing with me is.....I've done this before. I know what girls are like between the ages of 18-22.....they're crazy. They're constantly changing their minds on what they want in a man. I've been in love twice and I've lost both of my girls to college. That sounds ridiculous but its true....they've left me for the college lifestyle and I'm afraid to get deeply involved with someone that's yet to experience that in life because I've been burned too many times before. I guess its kinda foolish of me, but I'm figuring out what I want. Being with someone for so long and being dumped really turns your head on things. And I know being 21 and being able to go places shouldn't be the thing I look for in a girl because there's plenty to do that doesn't involve drinking. But my thing is.....I'm only 22 once and soon my party days will be over and I need to find someone that will want to party my days out with me and then settle down together. That's all I really ask for. So I think I need to have a little talk with this girl because I'm pretty sure she's in love with me. I hate myself for not being decisive from the get-go but sometimes it takes time. But who knows, maybe she isn't so interested in me. I can read when a girl is into anyone else but me. When girls hit on me I just shrug it off as nothing and never capitalize. I'm naive to the fact that girls find me attractive....sometimes. This doesn't make much sense but its the best I can explain myself. 

This NCAA tournament is really pissing me off. Two of my final four teams have been eliminated.....Wake Forest and Syracuse. There goes my chances of winning. My three favorite teams are still in it......Michigan State, North Carolina and Illinois. My cousin goes to Illinois and I have many friends there so its pretty cool that they were ranked #1 pretty much all year. It figures that once I move away they start doing good. This is the same thing that happened to the Cubs when I moved to Florida....they won the division and went to the playoffs. And get this, I graduated school a few days before the infamous game 6 Steve Bartman game and returned home one day before game 6. Then they lost two games in a row and I was so mad because I was ready for a Cubby world series. But this year they have their own version of the Livestrong bracelet......of course I bought into the gimmick. Its Cubby blue and has the Cubs logo on it and says ""BELIEVE"". I'm still waiting for it in the mail though. Speaking of baseball, I bought a 12 game season ticket package for the Dodgers this year. It was really cheap and it should be fun since it'll be me and three friends going together. I look forward to May 31 when the Cubs visit town. 

Speaking of my cousin, he was supposed to be here this weekend to visit me. My cuz is like my brother. He just turned 21 and he told me something the other day that almost brought a tear to my eye. We were on the phone and we were reminiscing (spelling again?) about his dad, my uncle, that had died a few years ago from stomach cancer. First of all, God rest his soul. He was the best guy in the world and one of my father figures growing up. But what my cousin said that got to me was he said ever since that day all he wanted to do was go to a bar with me and have a few drinks with his best bud and now that was going to be possible since he has finally turned 21. I know, I know.....more drinking....but that meant a lot to me. I've never had someone tell me the reason they were coming to see me was becuase it was one of their dreams to sit there and have a brew or 6 and watch the game with me.....it was touching in a way. 

My writing habits have improved a bit. I have two good ideas on my plate right now that I'm gonna pen into a short script and we'll see where it goes from there. They're both comedies and I'm in the research/brainstorming stages at this point so its nothing to get overly excited about. My problem is I get inspired in the most odd places......the shower, running on the treadmill, eating at a restaurant.....I swear my brain only works when I don't have a pen or computer at my side. I need to buy a tape recorder or something. Everytime I try to force myself to write, nothing comes to mind. You can't  rush inspiration though. My guitar skills are improving as well!!! Nathan made me this sheet with all of the chords on it and my goal is to learn a chord every other day. I know that isn't gonna happen but its my goal.

Wow, this thing is long (that's what she said....haha) and I should just slap a cover on it and call it a mini novella. That's what happens when you don't write forever. I want to write more cuz I always have more to say but I don't have time right now. I've been putting off breakfast since 8am and now its time to eat my leftover Jack in the Box."

"event","So the other night I went bowling with some new(er) peeps. It was fun. I hadn't been bowling in a few years so it was a good time. Too bad I suck though and totally lost to Britt by one stinkin' point. I would've rather lost by 20 points. But you know what, I got beat fair and square so I won't complain anymore (plus I dominated the air hockey game later on in the evening). After the bowling match, we all went to TGIFriday's. Believe it or not, that was my first time ever at TGIF. Its funny because I told everyone back home that I went to TGIF and they were shocked. You see, everyone back home used to be so amazed that I never set foot in a TGIF, that I swore to never set foot in a TGIF as long as I lived. Well these new friends didn't know that so I wasn't gonna hold them back. Plus the food was really good so I'm not gonna complain. I did however escape with someone's $20, but don't worry.....they will get it back somehow. 

I had to get my smog test yesterday.....and my piece of junk ass car passed. I was so shocked when he told me I passed. So that means I'm good to go to get my car registered in the great state of California. Why do they call states ""the great state of ______""???? I know that rule applies to some states, but what about states like Nebraska and Montana or Wyoming that no one really cares about. What's so great about Wyoming??? Oh I'm sure they have some sweet buffalo and cattle, but that's about it. I'm sure the view is nice too.

So since we're gonna be looking for 2 new roomies coming up at the end of April, Nathan posted an ad on craigslist to see if we'd get any responses. If you wanna check it out, here ya go........ http://losangeles.craigslist.org/roo/62441141.html . Its quite funny and reflects both mine and his humor a little. Of course we're not serious about the girl thing. We're both very laid back guys but we know what life's about and it isn't about looks.....I mean, just look at us. You'd be surprised how many people have responded to us though. It seems the trend is moving out to LA these days. We even had a few people respond wanting to meet us because they thought it was funny. That's no joke either.....both guys and girls want to meet us cuz of our humor on an ad.....craziness. 

Man, I have to be up in 4 hours. No check that...I have to be at work in 4 hours. How do I go on without sleep???

Last night was my first night in my new room. Its a little weird but I can deal for 7 weeks. Dave wasn't very happy at all. You can see the disappointment in his face every day. I know what he's going through. Its not cool being without someone you love and trust. But he'll realize things will get better. Meg dumping me is letting me live right now. If I was with her still, I'd have no life and no fun and most importantly no new friends. 

Speaking of new friends and our ad on craigslist, we had a girl call us and she wanted to meet us.....so we invited her over for Kool Aid. She's new to LA and she's from Modesto but she totally gets our humor and we've picked her to be roommate #1 come may 1st. She's a little older (27) but she seems to dig Nathan and I so its all good. I think we'll all get along just fine. All we need is one more roommate and we'll be set. So anyway, she came over and we all sat around and did the normal chatty stuff and listened to a lot of good music.....but then she must've had the urge to do karaoke so we went to Dimples and did Karaoke. Well I didn't sing but Nathan did. He sang ""Long December"" by the Counting Crows. So this girl is gonna be our roommate and she wants to hang out this weekend sometime with us. My friends are coming in town so it'll be a perfect time to meet some new people. 

Jon Brion is the most amazing film composer of all time. I'm listening to the Eternal Sunshine soundtrack.....just amazing. I need to go see him perform. But other than that, my day was pretty cool. Amanda and I went shopping at Topanga mall and I got some new T's from Hollister and Abercrombie.......only the clever shirts of course. Nathan made a funny comment today about my wardrobe......but its true. He said all of my T's have some kind of funny saying on them.........he called my T's today typical Tony T's. But maybe that's the way I want it.

"event","Last night was the Oscars....the big night for us movie geeks. And I am so happy that Million Dollar Baby and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind brought back the gold!!!!  I don't know if I agree with Eastwood getting best director over Marty Scorsese, but it was never meant to be for Marty. My favorite director, Stanley Kubrick, never got his Oscar. But I'm not here to bicker......this is a celebration!!!! Just about every movie I thought would win, won so......I must be a genius! Hillary Swank was so gorgeous last night....oh, and the chick from The Phantom of the Opera. I felt like Joan Rivers watching the red carpet show. I've never really commented on what people were wearing until yesterday. It was weird.

Poor Dave is having a tough time over here. I am playing the role of being his good friend and stuff but sometimes nothing helps, especially when you're dealing with love. I'm trying to take him to do things that he and Amanda didn't do. Since they mostly just sat around in the house, I'm trying to get him out more often. Tonight we went swimming......well I went swimming while he froze to death in the hot tub. For some reason, the cold water didn't phase me today. The girls that were in the hot tub thought I was crazy, but I guess I am crazy......like a fox. 

I need some new summer clothes. It was so hot today and I was wearing jeans.....so that made me think that I needed some new T shirts and shorts.......Abercrombie, Hollister, AE, Urban Outfitters.......here I come!!!!

I'm drinking pink lemonade Kool Aid. Nathan says I make one hell of a batch of Kool Aid....and I tend to agree.

That's all for now......I'm boring tonight.....must be my pajama pants or something."

"event","I feel really bad for David right now. I mean really bad. Getting dumped isn't fun especially after you've been with someone for a year and a half. I know he doesn't see it or know it now, but things will eventually get better for him. He just needs to keep on keeping on and make every day a little goal. Last night was probably the toughest for him. Amanda has been staying the night at a co-workers house for the past week or so and she came home last night and just started packing up her stuff and moving it into the living room. Apparently, that's going to be her living space for the next 2 months. It sucks seeing David like this. He's not very full of life in the first place but this is just ridiculous. I can look at him and know exactly what he's thinking. You just kinda get this blank stare and look off at nothing for extended periods of time...and all you do is think. You ask yourself constantly what you could have done to avoid this situation. You think of ways you can right the wrongs you've done. In some cases, there aren't really wrongs. Those are the worst cases. Knowing David's situation, he definitely could've done many things to stop this from happening. Everyone gets to a point where they're totally comfortable with someone and that's the moment when things start going downhill. He even told me the other night in his drunken stupor that he never thought Amanda would do this to him. Once you reach that level of comfort, you think you're set and you settle into this zone. Once you get in that zone, you don't think anything can happen to your relationship no matter what. I've been in that zone before and that's a huge part of the reason I got dumped in the first place. One year later, I don't care anymore, but I learned a valuable lesson. In this case it was simple.....all Dave needed to do was go out of the house every once in a while. Dave is a stay at home type of guy and Amanda is a lets go out type of girl. She put up with a lot of staying in on weekends over the past year and she was sick of it. Dave got to the point where he just sat in and expected her to do the same until they were old and grey. I also feel guilty for some of the stuff that is happening. I also thought it would never get to this point between those two so I just told Amanda to come out with me when I go out and if Dave doesn't want to go, no big deal. Well, the past month or so we've been going out and I've been her source of fun. I think she realized that she can have fun without Dave and gave him a few weeks to get his act together and he didn't....the rest is history. He's known for months that she wasn't happy and yet he still did nothing about it. So this was the alternative and this is what its come down to. It hit Dave really hard yesterday because he was watching her pack her stuff up and move it out in the living room. Its funny, only a week ago they were telling each other they loved each other. Then monday was the day they broke up. Things happen so fast. Now I'm just gonna be there for Dave because I know his situation so well. One day way down the road, he'll see this as a blessing. I thought Meghan was my everything and look where things are with us. I am in the position of power now. It took me 8 months to recover but I did and I'm a better, smarter person because of it. Between being dumped and moving to a whole new place, I've learned a lot about myself over the past year. I like the way I do things and I like where I'm going in life. 

Tonight is the Oscar's. For us film geeks, that's like the super bowl. I think Nathan and I are going to invite over some friends and order some pizzas and wings. I've been craving wings for quite some time now. I'm cheering for 2 movies to win tonight......Million Dollar Baby and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Eternal Sunshine better win best original screenplay or I'll a little peeved. 

Finally, another quote from Huckabee's that I think would make the world a better place. I kinda live by this one already, but many people don't see things the way others do......enjoy this quote!

""Everything you'll ever want and need is what you already have and are."""

"event","You know you've had a good night when you wake up with one sock on, no shirt, shorts (but no boxers) and you're missing your Livestrong band. I didn't even get that drunk last night. Well, maybe I did but I didn't drink a lot which is a smal victory for me. Last night was a celebration. Dave had called me while I was at work to see was going on. I think that was the first time he ever called me to drink. Dave never drinks. He's such a quiet guy and he rarely goes out.......which is the big reason he got dumped. So I decided to keep my plans with him and kind of make it a boys night out. My friends RC and Troy were too busy because they needed to start moving stuff into their new place. Their new place is pimped.....one block from the ocean. I was supposed to move with them in May but they found this place and they couldn't pass it up and they got out of their leases and I couldn't. Oh well. Anyway, RC and Troy couldn't make it and for the first half of the evening Nate went out with Ryan Stone, our other friend, to these girls' houses that they never met. So it was only Dave and I for a good portion of the night. I didn't care though. Dave needed a night out. Getting dumped is no fun and I was in his position exactly one year ago. I don't know if Dave had a good time or not, but I know how to get it done when it comes to a party. We went to the Saddle Ranch at Universal and got these huge ass drinks that were like $15, but well worth it. One of my old friends from a while back that I haven't seen since December called me and wanted to meet up in Hollywood on Sunset but I wasn't up for Sunset last night. Plus it was Dave's night so I let him call the shots....until he couldn't think straight anymore. We basically just chilled out and had a good time talking about his problems and stuff. I love being there for friends....that's what I do. But some people (mainly girls) say I'm too nice....as if its some kind of character flaw (that line reminds me of American Beauty). So girls won't date me because I'm too nice, that's the funniest thing I've ever heard. Once Dave had a few drinks in him, he started checking out girls. He was telling me that he actually didn't feel dirty checking out girls and he would have felt dirty if he was still with Amanda. These girls approached us at one point and wanted to take a picture with us. They said they were from out of town and looking for some hot locals.....so I don't know why they stopped and talked to us. But we took the picture with them, but didn't stick around long. We decided to go to the BBG for the 80's band....when in doubt, hit up the BBG. So we went there and danced/rocked the night away to 80's music. It was at that point that Nathan met up with us because he was done with the girls he had met earlier. It was quite the drunken night for the 3 of us. I also made a drunk dial.....to someone really cool by the way......and even though I probably made a fool of myself, I don't regret making that call. I was living in the now and I wanted to make the call, so I did. At the end of the night, Nathan and I went to the Coral Cafe for some grub.....speaking of which, I'm gonna go eat my leftovers."

"event","Last night I get a phone call from my ex and we talked for what seemed to be forever....it was actually 2 hours....and I try to get back online to finish the entry that I started and my internet didn't work. But no worries, I'm back and in action and ready to talk. 

So I watched I Heart Huckabees last night. Good movies are always fun to watch. It was my third time seeing it and I like the movie more and more every time I see it. That movie may, just may, make Tony's top 25 list of all time. I know its just a personal favorites list but its fun to do....especially when you're obsessed with movies like I am. I don't think there's anything I don't like about the movie. I can't really explain what its about in detail but its an existential movie made for thinkers and it kinda preaches that human drama is inevitable. Which is also funny because I love the people who say they like to avoid drama. There is no way to avoid drama. The reason we exist is drama. Without drama our lives would be so mundane and meaningless. Granted there are certain dramas that can be avoided, but to say you avoid all drama is ridiculous. So anyway, back to the movie...The cast is amazing. Dustin Hoffman and Mark Wahlberg play my two favorite characters in the movie. I love how quirky and random it is. Maybe that's why I love it so much...I say some weird things sometimes and this movie is like that. There's randomness, nothingness and somethingness all in one package. As a matter of fact, the movie is so good, I think I'm gonna watch it again tonight. Either that or Schindler's List. I say Schindler's List because I just bought it the other day, not because I'm looking to be depressed and cry, but because its one of the most amazing ""lighting"" movies these eyes have ever seen. And since I'd like to be a DP one day, I study movies like that. I leave this paragraph with a few quotes from Huckabees to entice you to see it.

-Albert Markovski: Nobody sits like this rock sits. You rock, rock. The rock just sits and is. You show us how to just sit here and that's what we need.

-Translator: We smashed locusts and made bread.

-Cricket: Jesus is never mad at us if we live with Him in our hearts! 
-Tommy Corn: I hate to break it to you, but He is - He most definitely is.

Yeah, fun. Yesterday was probably the most stressful day of my life. Well, at least the first part of it was. A few weeks ago I got pulled over in Glendale and the cop gave me a warning for driving with out of town plates when I should've gotten them changed 20 days after I moved here. So I have to get all that crap taken care since I still have my IL plates on my car. The problem is I just got my car fixed last week cuz it stopped running and spent half of my paycheck on repairs for that. So now I'm worried that I won't have enough money to register my car in CA...not to mention I still have to go grocery shopping and pay my cell bill which was way more than usual this month since I used it up in Big Bear and I was roaming. Oh, and I forget to mention that I have to get this car situation settled by the 7th of March or else I have to go to court. I've never had a ticket before in my life. I speed, but I never get caught and I still don't have a ticket, unless I don't get this crap done. So I'm still a little stressed but I'm trying not to worry about it. I'm pretty crafty and I'll find a way to get it done, I always do. Even if it means calling home and asking for some money, I might have to do that. I know I'm 22 years old and I should be able to handle myself but the fact of the matter is you're going to be depending on people for the rest of your life. There's no way to dodge it. I'm as grown up as I think I'll ever need to be right now. I do everything for myself and don't count on anyone and I don't make much money in the process, but I'm still living on my own...and I like it that way. I know calling home for money isn't very grown up or whatever, but we all need help sometimes. 

I haven't been getting good sleep for a long time. Actually its been over a year since the last time I slept truly comfortably. You see, I got used to this thing called a girlfriend. You might have heard of one of those before and I get them once every blue moon. We were together for 2.5 years and after sleeping with someone at your side to hold on to, you get used to it. You get used to her laying on your chest or you get used to putting your arm around her. I think that was one of the toughest things after we broke up....getting used to sleeping alone again. Well I guess the absolute hardest thing was not being able to call her whenever I felt like it but you get the point. A few weeks after we broke up I went out and bought a huge body pillow but it just wasn't the same. Waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a pillow next to you isn't the greatest feeling in the world. Especially after you were madly in love with the person that slept next to you for those years. One of my favorite things was watching Meg sleep. Once in a while she'd catch me, but she'd just open her eyes and smile back at me. I miss that. I want that back......not with her but just in general. After a while the body pillow didn't work out and I kicked it to the curb. Now I sleep with a little penguin stuffed animal that doesn't do the trick at all. I just miss watching a movie with someone that I can hold close to me. Its no fun being alone in a big bed.

Going back to Dave and Amanda breaking up.....its weird and will be weird for quite some time. She's kinda taken a liking to one of our co-workers already. Its strange how quickly the bonds of trust can be broken. It takes less than a sentence for someone's trust bond to be broken. For Meg and I, it was broken once she said those famous words.....we need to talk.....nothing good ever comes out once those words are uttered. There was no one I trusted more than her. I shared everything with her. I told her thoughts that I wouldn't even tell my own mother. BM (before Meg) I had no problem trusting people. I'm a good judge of character and I usually can peg someone after meeting them in person the first time. But once she got rid of me, I had a hard time talking to anyone. I wouldn't share my feelings with my best friends. I would sit in my room and write or take my iPod for a long stroll around the city (Chicago). There were still some things that I couldn't tell Meghan but she basically knew everything about me. It wasn't until recently that I was able to trust people again. Like I said in my last entry, I'm over Meg. I know I've mentioned her name way too much in this, but she was a big part of my life, but that part of my life is over with now. I would still be her friend, but nothing more. I'm not saying I trust everyone now. I've found someone I can trust again though and its been a long time since I've had that feeling and its great to get it back. 

Now for today. Today was pretty cool. I don't have one complaint about work today. I actually liked my job today. Probably mostly because they had me doing assistant editor work. I got to log clips and digitize some footage for our Battle of the Bulge show. I know you don't have any clue what that is, but I'll try to explain....When you get footage you load it into the computers so it can be edited. Digitizing is when you load the footage into the computers in very large clips. Think of it as taking everything that's on the tape and making it into one giant clip and loading it from the tape and onto the computer. Now logging.....Logging is taking that massive clip and going through the footage and separating it by each take and taking the unnecessary footage out. That way when the editor comes in tomorrow, he'll have all the clips ready to go and labeled on the computer and he doesn't have to sort through all the garbage. So yeah, that's what I did today at work. Nothing too exciting, but it beats working a regular job. I also found out that I'm very respected at my work. The receptionist and I talk all the time and she fills me in on the latest gossip around the office and today she told me that people are pretty much amazed with me there. They can't believe that I know all about the industry at this young of an age. What they don't know is that I wanted to get started in this industry when I was even younger. I've always known its not about what you know, but who you know and I contemplated skipping college and just moving out here. But I figured there wasn't going to be any companies in LA that wanted an 18 year old with no experience so I went to college, got my degree, got some experience under my belt and well, here I am. Now that my foot is in the door, I just have to get to that next level. I'm figuring that out in my head as we speak...or type. I think that's all I really have to say right now. My brain hurts."

I need to comment on this rain, its ridiculous. When I sat there in Chicago deciding on if I was going to move to LA or NY, one of the deciding factors was the beautiful weather. I can have this rain in Chicago. Maybe in one of my drunken stupors I did one too many rain dances and the god's are pouring on the rain. Bring on the sun so I can wear sandals and shorts again.

I don't know what to write about today. I haven't written anything in a while and it seems like there's nothing to say. I guess I could complain about work, but isn't that what everybody does? Well.....I will anyway. I want a new job. I guess I don't need a new job, but I want one. I'm not happy at the place I'm at. The pay is below the standard weekly rate and its not really what I want to do. I only do it out of necessity though. I was stupid and out of control with credit cards when I was 18 and I'm paying for it now. I'm not in huge debt or anything, I just have a little to pay back that I don't really want to. And I know I won't be at this job much longer but I just can't wait to get my first gig on a real movie. Cable TV documentaries isn't really my bag. While I'm on this topic, I can make my official announcement that I am a TV star. I will be on TV sometime in March. You can catch me on the show Battleground: The Battle of Waterloo on Discovery Channel. You will see a close up of me holding an old school rifle up to Napoleon Bonaparte....then later you will see me playing Napoleon Bonaparte being tied up from behind. Its classic. This just in, I might get a quick little side job working on the Dukes of Hazard movie with Johnny Knoxville and Jessica Simpson.....its only a week long and I'll find out by the end of the week if they need an extra hand. 

A side note to the job is the company a few of my friends and I started. We're called Monback Pictures and for now we're going to mostly be doing stuff on our own.....our own scripts and short movies so that we can put together a company reel and then once people see what we can do, we'll get more business or we can even get people that want us to make their scripts and I think it'll be a fun, interesting process. This is something we've all been talking about since film school ended two years ago and now that the key group of people are out here in LA, it was time to get started and we did. We have a logo and everything. Its weird to me that three 23 year olds (well I'm 22 I suppose) started a company. Sounds good to me though. 
We have one project under our belt already. I think we're gonna have a website too for all things film related. At least that would be a good idea for more exposure to our talents (or lack thereof). I'll have to bring that up at our next meeting. Anyway, the film is called Regular Unleaded.....written and directed by Troy. I think our next project will be written and directed by RC and then its my turn. I can't wait. I have my idea ready to go and I just have to transfer my thoughts onto paper and we'll be good to go. Its rather exciting actually. 

And then there was The Notebook. I don't know what it is about chick flicks and me lately. Maybe its because I've always been in touch with my feminine side....or perhaps its cuz I'm a momma's boy. But they just make me cry. All of them are pretty much the same story line and they all have the same outcome......nice, not so hot, poor guy gets girl over good looking, strong, rich guy. Now, I have no problem with that, but that isn't the way things go. And excuse me for this rant, but nice guys always finish last. Its a fact of life. I've been nice for 22 years of my life and its gotten me nowhere. The common response is always......well, you've just been with the wrong girl. I'm still trying to keep the faith in females, but it just hasn't been there. There are a few girls, mainly one, that give them all hope, but the verdict isn't in yet. Anyway, back to The Notebook....so 3 almost grown men decided to sit down on a sunday night to watch a chick flick together. We are all the sensitive type and we all pre-warned each other that tears might be shed. One of the first scenes reminded me of my first real date back in high school. My girlfriend at the time used to live 2 blocks away from me and one day I just walked over there and told her to get ready because we were going on a date. So she put some clothes on and all we did was walk around the neighborhood and run through people's sprinklers. It was so awesome. I know its not a real date, but I guarantee you that she will never forget it.  In the movie all they did was lay in the street after a movie, but it was random and I'm a pretty random guy I guess. The movie itself was good. I was on the verge of tears but I was able to hold back. Nathan however, couldn't hold back his tears. It sucks watching those movies because it makes me want to be loved again. I know many people love me, but I've been in love before twice and twice its ended in my heart being broken. I'm just sick of being alone. I have friends and I have family there for me but there's nothing like being with that special someone. I miss that. I feel like I've been ready for love since I was 16. I never went through that phase that many guys go through where they'd try to get with girls for the hell of it just to say they got some. I was always the one that was serious and ready. I thought by now girls would come around and realize that there are actual nice guys out there, but they haven't. I'm at a point where I don't know what to do anymore. I'm honest to everyone I meet. I don't think I'm that bad looking. I'm not super model, but I'm not totally hideous. What else do I have to do? Should I learn how to stand on my head? Juggle? What is it that women want these days? The answer isn't someone that's nice and caring and will treat them like a queen anymore. I'm afraid those days are gone. I don't know. Maybe I'm just bitter and lonely. I'm still trying though and I'll never give up til I find someone that understands me.....understands my humor.....wants to be with me.....and most importantly loves me for who I am. I don't ask for much at all, just love.

And speaking of love, Dave and Amanda broke up yesterday night. That was weird. They're both my good friends and not to mention we all live together so......things around the apartment could be getting weird. I can't say I'm shocked it happened, I'm just shocked it happened yesterday. I've been able to talk to Amanda a lot about it because I'm there for her and stuff and I know exactly what she's going through. We went to lunch today and I saw a lot of things in her that I saw in me from a year ago. When you're in love, it catches you and holds on and its great. But once its gone, it really hits you.....hard. There isn't a worse feeling in the world than losing someone you're in love with knowing they're gonna move on or they already have moved on to be with someone else. You aren't able to eat. You can sleep but its the worst sleep ever. You wake up every 10 minutes wanting that person or wanting to talk to that person you've lost. You sit and wonder why. Your stomach hurts and you feel like throwing up at the thought of your somebody with another person. That's another thing The Notebook reminded me of. When Ryan Gosling saw Rachel McAdams when he was on the bus and she went into the restaurant and kissed her new man, it made me think of my life. I've seen that before. Its really no fun at all. The adrenaline rush and anger is so captivating. There's no other way to possibly describe it unless you've experienced it first hand. I don't know what Amanda and Dave are gonna do from here. I'm in a tough spot because they're both my good friends and I don't want them to think I'm choosing sides. Breaking up is hard to do.

Speaking of breaking up.....my ex called me the other night. Guess who wants to get back together with me? I literally froze. I didn't know what to say. Its been a year almost to the day and she now wants me back. Its funny how our brains react in these situations because no matter how many times you plan things out and know exactly what you're going to say, it always catches you by surprise. Did I know she was gonna want me back??? Yeah, eventually. But we barely even talk. We just started talking regularly recently and she busted out with that shit. But my brain did exactly what I wanted it to do. I shot her down. I told her it wasn't possible for us to be together. I told her my life is new and different and she isn't a part of it. I can't believe I said that though. I thought for sure I was gonna choke and not be able to be at least a little mean about it. But my brain is right...I've moved on. For the first time in a long time I've realized that there are more girls out there. I'm ready for someone new. If I can find one girl.....just one.....that has the old school mentality, I'm in. I'm just glad I didn't let her get the best of me this time. I could've easily folded but she's just not for me. Its a breath of fresh air saying that and actually, truly meaning it this time. Before it was out of bitterness. I can think of her with other people and not give a damn anymore. If you've ever been there, you'll know what I'm talking about. I feel like there's a monkey off my back and I'm ready to go on.

And finally, I've typed way too much tonight. Dreams. Dreams are so awesome. Mine are fucked up beyond reality but I'm getting good at dreaming. Yes, you can get good at dreaming. If you think about something right before you go to bed, you'll dream about it. But now I'm getting to the point of having lucid dreams. I'm not talking about the movie Vanilla Sky either. I'm talking about being able to control what you do in your dreams. Its like you're awake but you're dreaming. You can think about what you want to do and literally make that decision in your dream. The best part is when you make a decision and you don't get the results right away. I probably sound crazy saying this but its so great. If you want to fly, do it in your dreams. I did it the other night. I was dreaming that I was in a Chicago skyscraper staring out the window and writing and I literally felt like I was sitting above myself watching myself write and I can remember thinking to myself in my sleep and I wanted to jump out the window and fly. But a few seconds/minutes (who knows how long it was) passed and I wouldn't fly. I just kept writing and thinking.....but then all of a sudden I got up and flew out the window. Its like dancing with your brain and its so amazing. I want to get to the point where I have a lucid dream every night. Humans only use something like 4% of their brain power and I think it would be amazing to figure out how to use more. Michel Gondry has a new movie coming out called The Science of Sleep and I think its about lucid dreams.....I'm gonna have to check it out considering he's the director of my favorite movie ever....Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 

Ok, that's enough for now. I can't go on. I mean, I can but I won't. If I do, I won't have anything to write tomorrow. How am I not myself?"

"event","The past few weekends were very fun for me. I basically got drunk and partied hard and probably spent way too much money. But you only live once, right? When I'm 40 years old and have kids of my own (hopefully) I don't want to look back at my life and say ""Man, I didn't have fun at all."" I want to look back and realize how great my youngin' years were. So far I'm doing a good job. I don't regret anything I've ever done because I'm not an idiot. I know how to have fun with limits. Some people don't have that same understanding. This past weekend was a total bore. I didn't do much...but I still had a blast. Here's a recap:

So friday after work Dave, Amanda and I went out to the new Quizno's that had just opened up over here. I had the best sub....the chicken carbonara...pure bliss. One of my friends is an aspiring music producer and he recently produced a record for a band called You, Me & Iowa. So they had a record release party at the Roxy that I was invited to. So I went and the band played a few songs on stage. I'd never heard any of their music before so I didn't know what to expect. But lemme tell ya.....they were awesome. Muscially I'm a hard person to please and the show they put on was just amazing. I wish I could tell you of a band they sound like, but I really can't. All I know is I'm hooked and I had a great time. It was my first time at the Roxy so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the crowd goes. I didn't know the Roxy was a hang out for high schoolers though. When we showed up I was looking around and noticed I was the only one with facial hair there. It was a very awkward feeling. But by the time the band got on stage, there were more people my age to hang out with. But the band just blew me away and I got their demo CD thingy and its just awesome. I really hope they make it.  So that was my friday.

Saturday was a pretty lazy day. I woke up pretty early, but didn't do much. I had to make a quick run for work but that wasn't til noon and it took me about an hour so it wasn't like it was holding back my day or anything. After my run I decided I need a few new shirts that I can wear out. I swear I'm such a girl sometimes. So I went to the mall and bought some clothes. There was this really sweet Napoleon Dynamite tee with the Liger on it but they only had it in a small and not a medium...bastards! I will have that shirt! Anyway, after my girly moment at the mall I made my way to Hermosa Beach to RC and Troy's pad. RC's ex-girlfriend, Lauren, was in town for the weekend. I feel bad for the guy, but the breakup was his own fault. He was here in LA and decided he wanted to see what else was out there before he asked her to marry him and they decided to split...and she didn't want to. She was ready to commit. Its funny how guys think that when they're single they can get loads of chicks. Well, it didn't work out that way for RC and after a while he realized how much he missed Lauren and how big of a mistake he made. We all make mistakes and it just takes some time away from the situation to usually realize them and he definitely is feeling the effects of the breakup now. Oh, and I forget to mention that Lauren now has a new boyfriend. Guys should realize that's how it always works. Girls can find guys easily. They may not all be their prince charming, but they still date them. And that's where that situation is right now. But when I look and talk to Lauren, I can see the spark still there. I mean, they were dating for 5 years, that's a long time for someone our age. That's longer than a lot of marriages these days. So it wasn't a fluke that they were together and the feelings weren't fake. RC just needed to realize what the hell he was doing and he learned a valuable lesson. Anyway....so I went to RC's and we sat around and drank (only a little) and played a little Beyond Balderdash. I love that game! But that was about it for saturday...pretty uneventful.

Then there was today. I woke up at the ass crack of dawn (10am) and geared up for a big day of football. I did the dishes, cleaned my room and did everything else someone would do to prepare to have company over. The only thing is I wasn't having company over at all. It was just me and my food all day in my bed in my pj's. It was fantastic. I love the occasional lazy day, its very refreshing. What I don't like about my lazy days is when your ex comes online and starts bitching about their crappy life to you. I know, I know....I should have sympathy and I did. I calmed her down just like I always used to but I'm ready to one day just say 'Look, we aren't together anymore so I'd appreciate it if you didn't come to me with your life problems anymore because I'm not the answer.' I think that's a fair thing to do. After all, she did break my heart. I'm flattered and I love helping my friends when they have a problem but I don't think friends break other friends' hearts. I don't want to fill in the boyfriend role in her life without being able to see her or hold her or anything like that. After saying that though, I do miss her a lot. I'm still missing something in my life without her. Its funny but she said that she was missing something in her life and she didn't know what it was. Gee, I wonder. Her life is in shambles though and I wish I was able to do something to help. I talked to her mom about it today and her mom thinks she needs an old friend back in her life. I don't know if I can do that though. Once you reach a certain level with someone and you take a step or 3 back, its hard to rebuild the trust....especially when you're only able to talk on the internet or the phone. So I don't know what to do. I want to be there for her, but I don't. I know this last paragraph isn't making any sense but in my head it does. I'm sure anyone that's lost someone they love knows what I'm talking about. Speaking of girls, Summer didn't call me at all. She called on monday and tuesday to make sure I was alright because I felt like I was on my deathbed, but she didn't call at all this weekend. I gues I could've called her but I always figure that if a girl is really interested in hanging out, she'd call. Then again, knowing girls they could be thinking the same thing at the other end of things. I'll call her during the week sometime to see how she's doing. We're supposed to go out dancing sometime since we're the only ones in our group of friends that like to dance but it keeps gettig pushed back. Maybe next weekend. So anyway, back to my day. I ate and ate and ate and ate and ate some more....it was fabulous. I watched two pretty good football games as well. The Super Bowl is set for this year. Philadelphia vs. New England. I can't wait. So that leads me up to now. I'm just sitting around talking to people online like I always do. Its pretty fun though. I like having days like this where I can just relax and enjoy things and reflect. Its good for the old noggin' sometimes...and the wallet."

"event","So its been a while since I last typed....sue me. Once I got home from my not so lovely Christmas break, things got really, really crazy at work. All the rain that hit LA happened to be snow up at Big Bear where we were shooting our next documentary and all the roads were closed off and we can no longer film there anymore. So I've had to be on the phone all day with other places trying to find a mountain range that looks like the Ardennes Forest in western Belgium...so that wasn't fun. Speaking of my job, I'm sick of it. I know I've said before that its great and I've been promoted already and stuff but I don't like TV production at all. It might just be the company that I work for but its just not fun anymore. I know, I know, work isn't always supposed to be fun, but its important to me that it is fun since I get bored so easily. I need a film job. I don't know much about TV production. I know how films work inside and out and I need to utilize my talents. I feel so lost at work sometimes but I'm good at learning things quickly and I can always look like I know what the hell I'm doing. So my search for a film job started today. 

The past week one of my best buds came in town and visited me. We did many things but mostly hung out and had fun at the bars in Hollywood and Hermosa Beach. It was a great time and I can't wait for him to come out here next year. I love my guy friends here now, but they lack some of the things that my best of friends lack from back home. I have fun with them but its not the kind of fun that I'll remember for the rest of my life. We do the same things every weekend. I'll go down to Hermosa, we'll hang out and start drinking and they'll either A) want to play video games (which I find boring) or B) go down to Hennessey's (a bar) that I have fun at, but it isn't the kind of bar I enjoy the most. I guess I can't win every battle but every time I bring up going somewhere else, it gets frowned upon. 

Then there's my lady situation. It seems there's always some kind of lady situation on my mind. The girl that I so thought was going to be my next girlfriend turned out to be a bust. It turns out the only time she ever wanted to hang out was when I would spend money on her so I did an experiment.....I figured I'd just ask her to do things with me that didn't involve dinner or anything fancy like that and she never wanted to go out. So one day I decided to ask her out to a movie and of course she said yes. So I cancelled and we haven't seen each other since. The bitch of it all is she has like 6 of my favorite movies at her apartment and I need to get those back. But I do have her leather coat too so its not like I don't have something valuable of her's. I just think its shitty how girls can pretend to be interested in you and engage in physical activity with you and just drop you down. But I guess guys have been doing it since the beginning of time as well. Then there's Summer (not the season, the girl). We met on New Year's and its been good ever since. She just got out of a long term relationship and is very fragile right now.....which for a guy like me isn't good. Most guys would love to pounce on the opportunity for a weak girl that will want to have sex...but that has never been my cup-o-tea. But she's great. Nothing like Christy. We've had great talks together and she's been calling me every day for the past week so that has to be a good sign. There's already a big trust and respect there for each other and I hope things work out. 

But that's about it for me. I haven't written much lately and I need to do more of that (both in my journal and scripts). The problem with my job right now is I'm comfortable.  Once I get comfortable, I get lazy. One of the few things I like about myself is I know my own personal problems and I know how to take care of them. I'm not saying I know everything about everything at all. I just know myself very well and that's important in growing up. I still look forward to learning more about myself because I know there's more to be learned. This is also a good time for me to be learning about women. As much as I love them and hate them at times, its a good learning experience."

"event","Since I was 3 I have been going to sporting events. My first hockey game was at 3 years old. I remember everything about it...what I was wearing, who I went with, the final score...everything. Sports has been and will continue to be a big part of my life. I plan on taking my son to games (if I can find a wife). I'll try to get him involved in sports but I'll leave that final decision up to him. Needless to say, I'm a huge sports fan. This entry is about a guy that is amazing and lighting up the sport of football this year. His name is Peyton Manning. NEVER before have I been more impressed with an athlete in a single year. Tiger Woods had a hell of a year when he dominated the Masters Tournament. Golf is the hardest sport and Tiger showed what he was made of. But Peyton Manning is going leaps and bounds over Tiger, in my opinion of course. I'm watching him right now on ESPN and tonight he can break the all time record for most touchdown passes in a season. He was having a rather mediocre game (by Manning's standards) and rightly so because he is up against the best defense in the NFL. Going into tonight's game he needed 2 touchdown passes to tie Dan Marino's record. He just threw his first TD pass of the game which is what prompted me to write about him. I love watching him play because he doesn't play like any other athlete. I grew up in Chicago and he's equivalent to what Michael Jordan was to basketball....just a phenomenal athlete that's completely ahead of his time. Watching him is like watching a conductor with an orchestra. He steps up to the line of scrimmage and reads what the defense is about to do. Then he changes the play and is usually right. I've never seen anything like it before. He studies and studies and studies other teams defenses and their weakenesses. He studies their tendancies on every down. He knows what his opponent is going to do before they even know what they're going to do. On top of being the smartest athlete in all the pro sports, he's a great guy. He doesn't have an ego. He does many charity fundraisers. He is always pleasant to the press and media even when his team loses. He cares about his fans and he cares about his teammates. But most of all, he loves the game and has respect for the game of football, which not a lot of athletes do these days. He may not get the all time record tonight against Baltimore but he will get the record eventually. And there's no one more deserving for this record than Peyton Manning. I'm not even a fan of Indianapolis but there's something about him that makes you like him even when he's kicking the crap out of your team...much like he did to my beloved Bears a few weeks ago. So cheers to Peyton Manning, one of the few good athletes left out there.

I can't believe I just wrote a journal entry about a freakin' football player, but its something I was excited about and Manning deserves some credit for what he's done. On a more serious note, I'm sick of women. I won't make a long production out of this entry but to make a long story short, I'll just say I talked to my ex tonight and I've given up on the girl I mentioned in one of my earlier posts. We'll save that for another day though. T-minus 6 days until Christmas and t-minus 5 days until I officially freeze my ass off."

"event","Sometimes I love my work....actually most of the time I love my work. But today was a good day. I did have to wake up at the ass crack of dawn (6am) because we had a shoot day today at the Gene Autry Museum right by the LA Zoo in Griffith Park. We had to film the interview sessions for our upcoming documentary on Jesse James. I don't know if anyone knows how those interviews work for documentaries, but I'll fill you in anyway because I have nothing better to do. Its usually a small crew (5-7 people) and there's a person off camera asking questions to the person on camera. Usually the person on camera is some kind of historian or history buff. I always thought that the interview subject had really short answers......this is not the case at all. Each interview session lasts about 50 minutes and the subject usually blabbers on and on and on. So since we were at a museum and I had 50 minutes between camera set ups, I decided to take a stroll around the museum and see what it had to offer. I was quite intrigued by all the cool stuff. I realized there's so much history to the US that I don't know about. Everyone can repeat what they learned in history class but you can learn a lot just by going to your local museum and just checking things out. It even made me want to learn some of my mexican heritage, which I've never been interested in knowing about. It was pretty cool being able to just walk around the museum like we owned the place. It was closed today but they let us come in so we could do our interviews and they didn't even charge us for filming.....that's unheard of in LA, or anywhere for that matter. Museums are pretty scary too...especially when you're in this huge place with only 5 other people. You see all these mannequins and they start to get scary looking after a while. Not to mention you're surrounded by the history of the US and you never know what items could be sacred. But yeah, that was my day......another day at the office. Now I'm tired and hungry and must get going."

"event","Don't worry, I'm not getting a sex change. Besides the crazy aggressive lesbian chick, I met another girl this weekend. Girls have always come to me in bunches for some reason. I'll go through long, long droughts of being single and then all of a sudden girls appear again in my life. This chick is really cool though. We met through the site Hot or Not.com. I was always interested in the whole internet dating/meeting people thing. Sometimes people just don't have the time in their lives to go out every night and meet people. With internet dating, its a hell of a lot easier. I'm always skeptical with meeting people I've met online because I think I've only had one or two positive experiences. Well this one was the third positive experience. I didn't think girls like her existed. She's into sports. She loves movies. She's sarcastic, funny and cute. She's into the same TV shows as I am. She's laughs at my jokes and we have the same personality and humor. Oh, and she's from Chicago!!!..........She's basically a female version of me. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing though. Right now I'm just looking for a friend perhaps with the possibility of becoming something more. I think I made a good friend though. She likes to go out and she goes to bars. She does have one minor drawback which isn't a drawback at all really.......she's a White Sox fan and I'm a die hard Cubs fan. But I'm sure that'll lead to some friendly flirting back and forth between us two. She's cool though. Last night was the first time we met. We were just both bored out of our minds and wanting something to do and she was hungry and foodless so she invited me over and I picked up a pizza and we ate and watched 3 movies......Zoolander, Labyrinth, and Bring It On. That's the other thing. Its rare to find a girl that's into the same movies that I'm into. I have a weird mix. I love the really artistic movies and I love the really dumb movies and not much inbetween. I was there for a long time basically just having girl talk and eating pizza and watching movies. It was like a slumber party only I didn't have my pajamas...and I didn't stay the night. We did stay up til 6am but I had fun. The other bad part about the evening was I had to work at 9am. I got home around 6:30am and once my head hit the pillow, I passed out. I had to wake up at 8:30 so I'm on 2 hours of sleep right now and I feel like a zombie. It seemed like she had a good time so we'll see where things go from here. I'm semi-excited but I've learned not to get your hopes up because sometimes no matter how cool a chick is, she'll find a way to shoot you down. I just hope that I've made a friend that wants to hang out. If something else happens, great. 

I saw ""The Ladykillers"" for the first time the other day as well. Overall it was pretty sweet. Tom Hanks was fantasic as usual and there were a few smaller performances that stood out as well. I have 3 more movies to watch by the weekend.......""Raising Arizona"", ""Ed Wood"",  and ""As Good As It Gets"". I'm supposed to go shoot a music video this weekend with my friends for a contest for the band Yellowcard. But I found out yesterday that I have to work on saturday for 12 freakin hours. I guess I won't be able to work on it with him......hopefully we can re-schedule because it sounds like a great idea. Well, I don't have anything else for now. Its back to the tele for me."

"event","Alright, I'm obviously bored and not out at this point. Its saturday night and I just finished my thoughts on the day of thanks. I have my iTunes on, as usual, and one of the best lyrical songs ever written is playing. ""Time is never time at all. You can never, ever leave without leaving a piece of youth."" That says it all right there. There will never be another 10:47pm on November 27th. Every second that passes is a second we're closer to getting old and dying. That's exactly why I don't want to be locked up inside my apartment all night, but I will be. My 2 friends that like to go out every once in a while are in Colorado. My roommates are staying in because they're lame and went out last night. I even asked my roommate Dave if he wanted to go for a car ride with me to Taco Bell. He was too busy watching TV.  So I'm here and not so happy about my friend situation again. Not much has changed in the past few days. I want to go out. I want to live. I want to be a normal 22 year old guy, much like last night. Last night was great. I convinced my roommates to go out and we went to this local bar that has an 80's band that plays every Friday. I always have fun watching them play. I have so much respect for musicians. Music is one of the few things that I just can't do well. Usually I get introduced to something and if I like it, I'll catch on really quickly. I have started playing guitar and I just can't grasp it. Anyway, so we were jamming out on the dance floor to some old 80's tunes when all of a sudden I feel a tap on my shoulder. I thought it was my roommate Dave just fuckin with me and I turn around and there's this girl giving me the ""come here and dance with me"" finger. I can't describe what that is but its kinda like a ""come here"" finger. So I went over and we started dancing. We talked for a little bit and pretty much danced non-stop for 2.5 hours. I don't know if any of you that read this dance......hell, I don't even know if people read this. This is mostly for me anyway........Dancing for that long is quite tiring. Its like playing a sport. You're constantly moving your body. You're getting all hot and sweaty in a confined area and there's many people around rubbing around on you. So that was basically the scene if you can imagine it. My 2 most recent ex-girlfriends were some of the horniest, most aggressive girls I've ever met......well, they've met their match. This girl was AGGRESSIVE!!!!!! After a few minutes of casual dancing she took things into her own hands...literally. She basically grabbed me and wanted my hands everywhere on her. Now, I'm not one that likes to be ""that couple"" that is dancing too dirty or whatever, but this girl wouldn't have it any other way. She knew what she wanted and she put my hands where she wanted them. There have been plenty of times in the past where girls have approached me and tried to be aggressive but I was usually shy and they didn't have much luck. Its not that I think I'm a pimp or anything stupid like that, it just wasn't me. I mean, seriously, I might be the only guy in the world to turn down a threesome. I had my chance, I blew it because I chose to blow it. I didn't feel like it at the time and I had a girlfriend and I believe in being faithful no matter how cool it would've been. This girl was very attractive and we danced the night away basically grinding on each other all night. So the band gets off the stage at 1am and the bar closes at 2am. The band gets off the stage and she leans in and asks me and I quote.....""So, do you wanna go outside and make out on the patio???"" I answered back in less than a second but that less than a second seemed like an hour in my head. All I could think of was.....Holy crap or should I or shouldn't I? I came to the conclusion that I have nothing to lose and nothing really to gain and I was gonna be the same person no matter what I said. I wasn't taking her home for a one night stand. I wasn't taking advantage of her. I wasn't doing anything wrong.....So I answered ""Sure. Why not?"" We then exited stage left and made out on the patio for an hour. I had a good time and made a new friend for the evening in the process. I don't regret anything and I won't regret anything. I don't have a girlfriend anymore and to be honest my faith in woman kind is cloudy at this point. I won't get into mushy details about what happened between us but as I said she was aggressive and she wouldn't settle for just kissing. I'm a very sexual person. I like sex, I like kissing, I like everything that has to do with nakedness. We DID NOT have sex though. I do have limits. I think that was something that I needed after this past week. I don't consider myself a very attractive guy but I don't consider myself butt ugly either and lately I've hated myself and that was maybe God's way of saying.....""See, you're not that bad."" The night ended with a kiss goodnight and that was that. I didn't get her phone number, she didn't ask for mine. I know she's 24 years old, lives in Northridge and plans on seeing me at that bar again sometime. At least that's what she says. Which leads me to more about tonight. I thought it was sunday all day today. Sundays are my lazy day. I wake up at 9:30, shower, and then watch football all day and do laundry or whatever little chores need to be done. For some reason I slept in (at this point I still think its sunday). When I woke up from my beauty rest I immediately wondered why I didn't set my alarm to watch football. So I mosey around for a while trying to wake up and I turn on the TV and college football is on. I thought to myself....""that's weird."" College football is usually on saturdays. So I turned off the TV and did some other random things around the house. There was a pile of dishes that I washed and I cleand my room. So around 6:00 I decided to shower finally and get my day started. It wasn't until I got out of the shower that I realized it was actually saturday. I was quite excited. I was thinking to myself that it could be another night of going out and having fun! So I asked my roommates.....bad choice. They wouldn't dream of going out 2 nights in a row. That would be a sin. Since my friends Troy and RC are in Colorado, I decided to call some old friends from film school that live in Santa Monica. We haven't had the chance to hang out yet since I moved out here and I thought tonight would be a good night to give them a call. Well, I forgot its Turkey weekend and they were both back at home in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. So the big debate I had with myself was.........do I dare go out by myself for a night and try to meet some new friends???? Right now the answer is no. Its almost 11:30 and the night is still young but bars close at 2am around here, which is so lame. I could get up and get ready and be at a bar within a half hour. Hell, I could hit up the local bar again and go dancing. This would be a good chance to meet some people. I would be forced to talk to people of just sit there and look like a loser. However, I doubt it'll happen. I think my night is over before it even started. I wish my roommates would just bite the bullet and go out with me again. They don't have to spend money. They don't have to drink. Hell, they don't even have to dance. I just want to hang out and enjoy my youth. But it looks like its another night alone. One of these times I have to jump on the opportunity of going out by myself because I think that's the only way I'll meet new people. But enough bitching for now. I can't complain about my friend situation because I'm not really doing anything about it."

"event","This Thanksgiving was possibly the second worse day of my life, definitely in the top 5 worse days ever and I was gonna write about it on Thanksgiving but I didn't want to depress myself even more. The day started out just fine. I got up early to watch the football game. I ate a small breakfast. It was just like any other day. It was also the first time I was truly alone on a holiday. I come from a very close, tight family. We all live within 40 miles of each other and out of my whole entire family, I'm the only one that decided Chicago was too small of a place for me and my dreams. I'm a bit of a dreamer I suppose but I think I have the ability to do whatever I put my mind to. So now I'm here in LA, Burbank actually, and it was the first time I was without friends or family. Let me tell you......that isn't fun. I got through the first half of the football game just fine. Then at halftime the fun began to stop. I started thinking about how much I miss my family and how much I miss having fun with my friends. My friends here in LA are nothing like me. I wouldn't say I'm a socialite but I do like to be in social situations and mingle with people. I'm not the annoying guy that likes to be the center of attention at all times either. I go around and mind my own business but I like doing social things--bars, clubs, etc. Almost all of my friends here I met in film school and a lot of what we knew about each other we learned at school. I had my group of friends outside of school that I hung out with and partied with and I didn't really know most of the kids from my class outside of school. It was kinda like that high school thing....you had your core group of friends that you did everything with and there were your friends at school that you hung out with only at school but you still considered your friends. So that's where I'm at with them. I like going to bars. I drink. I like dancing and mingling. They drink too, they just like to get drunk at home and play video games which isn't my forte at all. So I started thinking about that. It doesn't help that 2 of my best friends from back home were here a week ago and we went out and partied the way I like to party. I got a taste of what I like again and I obviously liked it....a lot. So I missed my friends and fun and then I started to think of my family. Of course I called them and I basically talked to everyone in my fam because they do the same thing every year. So after I got off the phone with them I was like Ok, this is starting to get crappy. I thought it was gonna be a nice day to relax and enjoy my thoughts. Then the big kicker.......I started thinking about Meghan, my ex-girlfriend. Thanksgiving was always a big deal to both of us. We used to do our own thing and get ready together to meet up with both her family and my family. We were very much like a married couple except we weren't married. To top that off, she had a child of her own that I grew to love and think of as my own. Meg and I knew each other since 4th grade and we were great friends the whole time up until last February. So it was like a family was already started. We talked about marriage and everything was all planned out, including our engagement rings and her wedding dress.....but something went wrong somewhere along the way and long story short (I'm sure you'll hear more stories about her), she broke up with me. Boo hoo. So I thought about her and how only a year ago we had plans of marriage and I wondered how things could've gotten so bad in just a year. I knew she was back in Chicago for the weekend because her mom had told me she was coming back into town. Yes, her mom and I still talk. We became very good friends throughout mine and Meg's relationship. After many minutes of thinking about her I decided to take a shower because I thought maybe I'd forget things somehow. But then it just got worse. While I was shaving I just broke down. It was like everything hit me at once. I had trouble breathing. I started to cry. And I don't cry often, but when I do cry, I CRY! I consider myself a tough person and I know I'm a tough person. I can take a lot of pain and sorrow, but that day I just couldn't hold back. Maybe it was what I needed to get through the day or maybe it was just a way of dealing with my sadness. I guess that's a normal thing to do. When people are sad, they cry, so I cried. The rest of the day was just shit. From there on out all I could think about was the girl that I miss and love. There's one thing I can't stand and its when people say ""get over it"". Anyone who tells you to just get over it is either A) dumb, B)not a good friend, or C) they've just never been in true love. Losing someone that you've known for years, that was your best friend, the one person you could trust with anything......its very painful. Its not like I knew it was coming either. It was 2 days before Valentine's Day. The night before she broke up with me she still said she loved me and wanted to be with me forever. Its funny how fast things change. 24 hours later it was over. No more Meghan. No more Ciaran (her daughter). No more nothing. The one person I could trust with my life just betrayed me. Anyway, she isn't the point of this rant......You can't just drop someone out of your life. I don't care if its been 8 months now. I don't care how many people I make out with or have sex with, I can't get Meghan out of my head. I did for a period of about 2 days and for about 4 hours last night, but that's about it. Every other second of my days there's at least a nano-thought of Meghan. Sometimes there's just no way of harnessing your own thoughts. Anybody who thinks they have the answer to not thinking about someone you love, hasn't experienced love. Its just something that has to happen over time. I've accepted the fact that Meg and I can't be together right  now. There's just no possible way. Anyway, back to my turkey day. Other than me breaking down and crying and thinking about everything and missing everything, my day was pretty good. I ate my turkey sandwich with pride and joy. I watched my Chicago Bears lose again. That was a bad day that I don't want to relive again. Its a good thing I'll be home and with family for Christmas, but Christmas will be another struggle with the whole Meg thing because we had our traditions that I was a part of for the past three years and now I'm no longer part of the plan. I'm glad I waited until now to write this about my Thanksgiving. If I wrote about this on thursday, every other word would be fuck or shit or bitch and I would've been pretty bitchy. But now I'm fine and I feel better about things. I sometimes just slip up and think when I shouldn't, but you just can't help that. That is all for now."

"event","Ok. So my job right now is basically driving around making runs for the production company I work for. I know......WOOOHOOO!!!! But I always look at the bright side, my foot is in the door. So as I drive around making my runs around Hollywood and the Valley and the occasional run to Santa Monica, I start to notice things. Now I have 5 dogs back home in Chicago. Not once has my family ever put a sweater on them. They don't need it, that's what the fur is for. It keeps them warm. So to keep this semi short and easy, what is with all the god damn accessory dogs in LA!?!?!?!?!? I don't understand it. I know why guys get dogs......they just want girls. But almost every day I see people with these small dogs, usually a chihuahua, and they have these huge purses and this tiny dog just chillin' in the purse. On top of that the collar matches the color of the purse. Then they even dress them up in little sweaters. Its hot enough here in LA. A dog doesn't need a fucking sweater when it 75 degrees and sunny 357 days a year. I think what's even worse are the stores that have all the accessories for the dogs. I think the dog I saw the other day had a sweater on that cost more than my entire outfit. I'm a dog lover and I understand people love their dogs. But let's face it.....they're not human beings. They can't talk and they lick their own asses (although some humans lick ass too). I'm not upset or anything about it, I just think if you have enough money to buy your dog a Chanel sweater, you probably have a few bucks to give to a homeless person or some kind of charity. I think the last thing people think of is the person they're walking past every day that owns nothing and lives nowhere.  I think about the homeless all the time which is why I'm writing a script involving a homeless person. Personally I don't have the money to give to charity right now but when I do, you better believe I'll hand some of it off. There's nothing I like more than making people happy. And that's all I have to say about that.

So yeah, I know I haven't kept up with this every day.....so sue me. I had a busy week or something. I'll probably comment on my weekend sometime soon. I had some friends visit......that was fun and interesting. And usually my journal entries aren't on stupid subjects like this. My ex-girlfriend dominates my brain space for most of the day and sometimes I have to just not think or write about her for my own sanity. But now its getting late and I have to work one more day before the weekend.....thank God!"

"event","Hello people. This is my first entry, how exciting. As you can see my current mood is tired so I'm not gonna have much to say tonight. I have sooo many things going on in my life right now. I guess that's just part of growing up....yucky!!! I'm gonna try.....I said TRY to write every night. I do appreciate the fact that people are interested enough to hear what I have to say and you'll definitely get my opinion on many things....including the 2004 election.....but I'll save all the good stuff for other nights. I look forward to hearing from you and thanks again for listening to me ramble on. Peace."

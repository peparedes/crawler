I have core people in my life whom i love to death and i want to spend every waking second of my days with them. I don't get my fill not even close. I can't function without them. i have this mask on to the world but really i need time to tear the F****** thing off and just be ME! But i can only do that with them. And when i've seen them lately its just...not enough of the right kind of quality time. Not that i don't love it and im thankful for it...but i just need more! I feel like at school im surrounded by people who i most likely won't even remember once i leave. Im so busy with life that im not ever around to talk with ppl i don't see but then i can't anyways. I just can't handle it right now.&nbsp; I know it makes me a terrible person because i said i would be but...what happens when you mentally can't anymore. Not that i wouldn't love to be warm and loving and helpful but i've got so much taking up my brain that i feel like i might just overload. I keep telling myself oh once this is over things will settle down but i know that once this is over something new will spring up. I take every time i have that im not doing something to relax...just some brittney time i can't spare it. Im sorry but if i don't i will truly lose my mind. And i have all this pent up energy that i can only express to my core ppl and i can't! It makes me feel lost and confused without them. Im so much of a ppl person that i can't stand not having them around. No one else is close enough yet for me to be ME! And when im just playing it safe and taking on the roles ive created for myself in life i...just need an outlet. I can't keep a face up and ppl are starting to notice. And im starting to with drawl just because i can't handle it anymore. I need them HERE for me but i know its not their fault. I love them so much more than myself i just miss them with all my heart."

"event","In quite place my soul awaits
silent as the trees 
My spirit dances wistfully 
as leaves caught in a breeze 

Deep waters and cool shadows
Play a melody 
The kind I simply wish to hear
But sadly only see

Off to where only i can be
I sit and wait for love
Blindly holding out my heart 
trusting him above 

The canyons stretch out before me
my heart it tries to soar
I simply can't release it
For fear of something more

My secrets are kept locked away
where none but God can see
though when surrounded by natures grace
i find I'm truly free"

They hurt like landing face first into a catus then rolling off it and smacking you mounth on a dumb bell. And no...i can not chew things at this point in time thank you for asking. I should have had lunch and breakfast but...being as how i slept in and forgot to shower yesterday...that didn't happen. I offically think...that we should declare tomorrow a drink hot chocolate and stay home reading a good book snuggled up with you favorite blanket snow day. NO SCHOOL!!! but that won't happen because all administation in LPS have massive SUV's that im confinced could possibly drive up the side of everast. So...youd think i would be staying home tonight since my day has been soo..not what i wanted...but i have a choir rehersal...thank god its not marching band so im not going to complain too much about that. BUT!! i will however complain about the disgusting ...well he isn't a boy but he aint a man either. More like a ***BEEP*******************************. And yes...i do feel that way about him. At times...i'd like to well kick him in the nuts...laugh for awhile...then walk away. Harsh? No not harsh enough. But anyways...i think i am going to go be a sappy girl and put in the notebook so i can cry at the romanticness."

Ok sorry to switch notes on you...but there is something that has been bothering me. I know it shouldn't but well..it effects my sister and well thats not cool with me. I seriously think i will say something to beth. They way she treats the people around her is completly bitchy...and they way she treats someone who has been there for her through all her hard times hardly asking for anything in return at all is completly over the line. When i heard about what shes been like i really wanted to just slap her. Im going to say something to her the next time she talks to me. Im not sure what but...well she already hates me...and if she doesn't she hates half of me(mallory) and thats enough to get a response out of me. Mallory didn't do anything but be a good friend. She ended up getting abused by that friendship and anyone who does ne thing bad to my sister is going to get it from me sooner or later. Don't freak out and think im going to murder her or hurt her. Im not that way. But i am going to give her a very strongly worded...um...tell off. If no one else is going to tell her straight out shes being a bitch to everyone and needs to get over herself...i will. No ones aloud to treat my sister like she doesn't matter. Not even her old best friend."

"event","For once i'd like to be
What it is you want 
Im tired of disappointing you
Sick of hearing why i don't live up
Im done with not being enough
But still my heart yerns for your single approval
I wish i knew what it was you so desire from me
Then maybe i could grasp it
Maybe i could be it
Maybe i could just make you happy 
Maybe i could be enough for you 
Maybe you could love me the way i need

I know its selfish
To ask this of you
You don't know the things i know
you can't see what i see so plainly
I know its wrong for me to feel this way
You know no better
You had it just as i do
But i wish you didn't hold this power over me
I want to break it and be off without you
But i can never go and not take you with me
I've seen those drivin away by your tendences
I've seen the hurt left on your heart

I want you to see what i see 
Though to tell you is pointless
I want to show you what its done for me
though showing it is impossible
when its not what you are looking for 
not what you expect of me  
So im back to the begining
I long to feel your embrace and know
You love me and im good enough for you

To chase a dream that can no longer be caught
Is foolish and selfish
To grow from the reality of losing a dream
Is wise and painful"

"event","Everything happens for a reason. Thats at least what i think. Somethings are harder to understand than others. I think one of the hardest things to do is talk with an old friend about your past together. Well when there is unfinished things. But once you do it feels so much better. Its weird to relize things about the other person so late. Even stranger yet...when you knew it was there but weren't sure...cast it off as nothing...then it turns out you were right. I didn't know someone could feel that way. AT that age. Its almost more than my brain can handle. Mind boogling. I do feel strongly for this person...but the feelings don't go past good friendship. Which i don't want them to. He on the other hand...its been 7 years since we met. Theres so much history. So much in our past that has gone unspoken for years. Im glad its finally out. idk something he said was too much for my brain. Im gonna go eat chocolate."

"event","What i wanna know is...what age do you have to be for what you want with your life to matter. I always thought that you had to be 18 before you got to have a say in the way your life was run. U know...u didn't have to agree with your parents but you had keep your mouth shut and live with it till you were older. But after talking with some people...i guess thats not how it works. I dont know what to do anymore. It would be so much eaiser just to go with what my mom wants and forget about what i want. But i can't. I know i need to talk to her about it but how the hell do i freakin do that? Gosh...the way she says somethings hurts me so bad but what does it matter? Its just me. Or thats what i normally put it off as. I mean...from what i've heard she goes off on rants about what she doesn't like about my boyfriend. Heck i didn't know there was that much...but great now i have more to think about since there apparently is. She wont tell me about it. Nope. She just gives me those wonderful ""everything you do with say about or get from him is shit"" And i know thats what she thinks...sadly. I want so badly to share this part of my life with her...the happy parts the sad parts...ever part of my relationship but i can't. She wants to pretend it isnt there. How do i deal with that? It IS here. It IS a big part of my life. But how do i tell her it hurts me so much not to have any support from her on this. I don't think she has to agree but idk. Idk what i want. Honestly. I want to get away. I don't want to have to be here anymore. I know its not the answer to run away from your problems but it would make life so much simpler. I don't know what to do anymore. Right now i hate alot of things about myself...at this very second. I feel i should do something but i don't want to. And i don't think it would be right if i did. Im not sure it would be wrong. But there isn't a point other than the fact that my mom wants me to to do it. Crap i need to get away! I don't want to talk to anyone today!"

I don't know why i let myself talk myself out of everything i love. Its happened before. I get scared of...im not exactly sure...but i convince myself i don't want it anymore and then leave. I don't want to do that this time. I wish i knew what was wrong with me. Honestly. Why do i have to have so many things going on in me that i don't know about. I know about some but then i cant stop or explain why they are happening. I wish i knew what i could do about this. Im so worried that im going to screw this up too...like the million other things i've screwed up. Its not like i don't know what i have. Im so blessed...I don't want something else and i know what potential lies within what i have right now. But still...i dont trust myself not to go running in the other direction. Im not stupid! I swear. I know everything people are telling me to keep me from doing that...but sometimes it creeps up on me and i want out. Completely. Away from everything and out where no one knows me as me. I won't to be free from any ties and just able to idk. But then i know that i don't want that. Which is why this is sooo hard! Maybe im not ready to be counted on. Maybe im not as ready for things as i thought. That scares me."

"event","So i decided to make a different type of entry today. Im going to list things that i think...

1. Don't tell someone you love them when you don't because once they find out you don't it will hurt them 10xs worse. 
2. If you need to talk to someone about something talk to them not their friends. Somethings often get lost in translation. 
3. Life isn't fair. The King of the world died so you didn't have to. So stop complaining. 
4. No one said things would be simple so why do u expect them to be. 
5. If someone keeps hurting you...dont let them anymore. 
6. If you don't feel that something is right, don't be scared not to do it. 
7. If you know something is right, don't be scared to do it.
8. Don't tell people what you think they want to hear...most of the time they want to hear the truth the first time around.
9. If you feel alone cutting yourself off from everyone wont help things 
10. If something hurts you...its ok to let yourself feel the pain. 
11. Spend some time with just yourself...it improves your health.
12. If your haveing a bad day chocolate is fat free calorie free everything free except for comfort. 
13. Don't live life worried about what could happen because you'll miss what is happening. 

Well thats all i can really think of right now...some are kinda lame but oh well. I had a lot more but i can't remember them. I'll just keep adding to the list when i think of things. 

So anywho. Today was a good day. I got to Olive garden with my sister and lexi and some other ppl. Im still completly stuffed. Soup salad and breadsticks. YUMY!! I had all my homework done so that was good. I see aj sunday and i can't wait! Its gonna be so much fun! I think i've fallen head over heals for him all over again. If thats possible. I can't even discribe it. Hes...just right for me in everyway. Sigh* I miss him so bad. Well nothing really new has been going on so i guess i'll stop here."

I get to act crazy, loud, insane, and stupid...and people think its funny and think its awesome. But that freeze game...humph...no one would get me out so i made the biggest fool of myself. I hope Mrs.Martin will like me for it...oh well. It was fun. Lunch today was great. I love hanging with lexi. I feel like i've know her forever...we have so much in common and she totally gets how i think. I think i finally found my good friend i was looking for. So i asked her to winter dance with me lol. Long story don't freak out im not going lez on anyone. She doesn't want to go with peter and i can't go with aj...(he'll be out of town) so i figured she can go with me and then come to my house and spend the night for my bday. My buddy tasha might come to the dance too and my sissy is taking us out somewhere...and we have to wear our nice dresses...im nervous...lol. I bet she'll take us to McDonalds. lol

Enough about today...down to reality. Sunday i finally get to see aj for a long time. Its like...im so excited and i've been telling everyone and they've all said the same thing...are u gonna even talk? If u get my point. And actually im not looking forward to kissing him i just want to hang out with him. I don't even think we are going to be doing anything like that. Thats ok with me. I just want to see him talk to him joke around have fun. Well...it seems life is finally getting settled down. 

How long till spring break?"

"event","Im so sick of being so....idk the word. Yesterday i completly threw my boyfriend for a loop. Im so amazed sometimes that he stays as calm with me as he does. If i were him dating me i would have driven myself crazy way past now. But i guess thats why im dating him and not me...or anyone else for that matter. He loves me so much and well...frankly im not used to having that. He loves me...and hes seen my faults. All the hundreds that there are. I guess it comes down to what it always comes down to. I sike myself out. Im so worried about things i shouldn't be worried about and most of the time i don't even know that thats whats bothering me. I know its completly stupid...but im half afraid that now that hes seen all the crap that goes on in my head and sees the screwed up way i look at myself and others and life in general hes going to go running in the other direction. Im so used to having people...well at least the guys in my life see me as having everything put together and knowing how to deal with all the stuff that goes on. Its becoming insanly obvious that i can't do that. Not with him. And im not even sure why i want to. Half of me does and the other half keeps beating me over the head saying ""whats wrong with you? you know he loves you and wants to help so STOP being so stupid!"" Unfortunatly my other half (the side that doesn't make any sense) often wins. I don't want to make myself sound like a female gollum but if you've seen that part in the second movie you proably know kinda what im talking about. Thank god im not that bad. I guess what it comes down to is for most of my life i haven't really been able to live up to what i felt the important people in my life wanted from me. Except fishing. I never felt that i got good enough to where my dad was happy with me. He may have been but the way he showed it wasn't a way that i could see it. So now i have this deep rooted fear of not being enough. (mainly for the men in my life.) I know its stupid and i can tell myself till im blue in the face that im enough for aj and half of me knows i am. Its the other half that sits there and lets all the doubts about it slip in. Its so hard to not let that kind of thinking in. I was so used to putting everyone so far above myself that it didn't even seem weird to me. But now what do i do. OMGSH!! its a never ending circle. Ok im done with it. I don't know how exactly im going to change my way of thinking on this but im going to. If i don't i probably will end up like gollum and then well that would be bad. I'll keep you updated."

"event","She stood by the window letting the breeze blow her soft brown hair across her face. She shivered even though it was a warm summer day. She didn't notice the nurses coming in and out of her room to change sheets and check charts. All she saw was the distant mountians. Towering, majestic, watchful. They looked blue today and the distant ones had a new layer of snow lightly drapped over their tops. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She could still feel the freedom of standing at the top of one of those cliffs and the beauty of sitting on a boulder surounded by aspens and pines. Behind her the door opened and this time the doctor walked in. 
        ""You know you should be resting. You won't get any better if you don't let your body recover."" She picked up a chart at the end of the bed and scribbled down a few letters. ""Your tests show your getting better. We want that to countinue but we need you to help us out. Now come lay down and try to sleep. We have a few more tests to run tomorrow which will tell us what we can do for you from there."" The doctor replaced the chart and gave an apologetic look. She knew how hard it was for young patients to stay in a bed but it was best. With that she left the room. The girl made no move towards the bed. She didn't want to sleep. She was sick of sleeping, sick of resting. She was sick of this hospital room and sick of people watching everything she did every second of everyday. She was sick of being sick. 
         It had happened almost a year ago. When they first found it. She had been getting sick alot and nothing was making her better. Thats when they gave her the test. She remembered knowing instantly that the test had shown something bad. She was laying on a bed, much like the hospital bed she slept on every night now, and everyone had thought she was asleep. The docotor had come in and the room instantly hushed. The only light in the room was from the parking lot lights shining through the open window. Her mother had leaped out of her chair almost knocking it over. At first she didn't want to know what the doctor had to say she just wanted to go home. The doctor leaned in close to her mother and began whispering. Slowly her mother began to sit back down. Silent tears ran down her checks and her father rushed over and put his arms around her. He looked up at the doctor with pleading eyes. 
          ""Is there,"" he paused for a second and took a deep uneven breath. ""Is there anything we can do to help her? Is it possible for her to get better?"" Hes mouth slowly lost its firm masculine appearance and began to quiver uncontorlably. From the chair she could see her mother lose herself in sobbing. 
          ""There are a few procedures we can take to battle this but nothing is a guarantee. We can start by..."" That was the last she heard of the doctor. Her mind started raging with thoughts. Would she die soon? Could she get better? What about her friends? What will they think of her now? 
           A bird began to sing sweetly in a tree branch near her window bringing her back to reality. She looked down at her frail body and began to wonder if there was anything she could have done to prevent this. She knew very well there wasn't. Hundreds of talks with hospital nurses had finally convinced her that this was out of her control completely. It wasn't her fault in any way. It was caused by things in your body, but that didn't stop the thoughts of what if she had done something differently. Quickly she dismissed the thoughts from her mind and returned to gazing at the picturesque range. 
           ""When I get better,"" she said talking mostly to herself but also speaking to the remote mountains. ""I'll do something with my life. I don't know what yet, but i promise you it will be the most amazing thing you've ever seen."" With that she closed the blinds and slowly sauntered over to her bed. With as much effort as she could muster she pushed herself onto the bed a leaned back against the pillows. That was the last time she ever slept in that bed. 
            The next day the doctors came into her room after her tests had been run. She expected the same as always. ""Your getting better but we still need to keep an eye on you...blah blah blah."" Today was different. The doctors had half smiles half confused looks on their faces. She stood next to the open window and waited for the news. Her regular doctor spoke first.
            ""Um, the tests have shown us bizarre results. It seems that, well, your cancer is completly gone."""

Something else made the day great and those of you who know what that was know why it made me so happy. Things at home are...well actually i don't know how they are. My mom keeps changing. Things with my sister haven't changed. Its hard. I feel like i lost one of my best friends and we didn't even get in a fight. I didnt think that sisters really grew apart like friends do because we...well i don't know. Oh well. I have two weeks before im off goundment from my wonderful aj. But i don't know if i want to ask to see him that day. Something gwen said to me made me think. ""you can't always back down"" I agree. I want to see him that day! So bad i can taste it. But there is no way in hell i could possible ask my mom to. I know she'll get pissy about it and say no. Then everyone tells me but you'll be off punishment so she has no reason to say no. Well she doesen't really have a reason...but then again she does. Its not a good reason but its a reason for her. Im sure by now everyone knows my mom doesnt like aj. So she'll find another reason i can't go over to his house or him come to ours. Thats how it works. But then i feel like my other plan to make her happy won't work either. I thought going over to his house to hang with his family would be better than going to the school dance because i know how much she hates dances. But it looks like she'll be mad about that. Its to the point where i have to make a move but im scared to death to make a wrong one. Its my move and i don't know what move i can make that won't end up bad. Its soo....dificult. I wish my mom would just get over the fact that aj is going to be around and no matter how much she doesn't like him hes not going to leave. Oh well. Im sick of thinking."

I thought i knew her pretty well...almost 15 years...but just when i think she is thinking one thing she whips out something completely different on me. Today...she seemed happy with me. She hasn't acted like that in a long time. She didn't get upset with me when aj called she didn't get upset with me for being on the comp. I think it might have something to do with her new juicer. She is in a good mood cuz she got to use it today and she got to go out and buy alot of fruit and veges to juice. She even showed me how to use it. SHE also offered to take me to Kohls...which never happens. Unless i bug her about going for a week straight. But that doesn't change what im worried about. Honestly im scared to death. Oh well. Its past the point. The point that most things i care about seem to pass much to quickly. The point that almost makes me feel not human. It may sound weird but its true. Things get to this point and...well stop. They stop hurting. They stop seeming real. They stop everything. They are still there but they arent. Not to me. It gets to this point and i can't feel it anymore. Most things never get to where i do feel them. Im talking like SO happy i cry...or so upset about something that it makes me cry. Somethings do reach that point. Theres the first point where i tell myself it doesn't really matter so i don't let myself feel it...then theres the point where somethings reach where i do feel it...then the point where they pass where i can feel it. Thats normally the things that hurt the worst. Not many things get past the first point but when they do they all to quickly they pass the second one. *not the happy* Its not like i like being upset about things...i just like knowing that i care. But then they reach this point and well i don't really stop caring but thats what it looks like. It looks like that to me and i know thats how it looks to everyone else. And sadly when most things reach that point i feel so hopeless its hard for me to believe that things will change. Or that things will ever get better...let alone having it be me who can make it better. AHRG. It makes me so mad. This thing...this one thing was the first thing to make me care actually care in a long time. And it stayed. It kept hurting which i dont like but at least i knew i did care. But now..it got to the point. I hate that point. Its been there for a long time and i thought i actully got rid of it for once and it came back last night. It hurt so bad last night. But nothing came. I was sitting in my bed thinking about what i could do to make things better and the thoughts of how bad things are slowly creeped into my mind. The bitterness of it took over every thought going through my mind. But i sat there. Completly numb to how it felt. I knew it hurt me...but it didn't any more. I can't fully explain it i just know i hate it. I hate it with everything i have. But that doesn't change the fact that it happens. I just wish i knew why! And no one seems to be able to tell me why it happens. I have an idea but i've tried so HARD to get over it...over not feeling...get over not crying...get over telling myself that how i feel doesn't matter but it always comes back. When i think im getting there i relize that i never actually left where i had been. I know God answers prayers and I know he has a plan for me i just dont understand why i have to be this way. I Know i hurt people because of it. I know it just hurts me worse. I know its not supposed to be like this. But i can't change it and i feel so helpless. I've prayed so hard to have it be different and it seemed like it was. Untill last night. Pray for me."

"event","One of the greatest blessings in my life would have to be my sister. One of the worst things in my life...at the present...would have to be watching my sister go from taking a real intrest in my life and being there to talk to me about what im going through, to getting involved in her own happenings completely. I don't begrude her it...she is in collage...but at the same time...i miss haveing that person there. I honestly don't blame her though. I mean she has a bunch of new friends an amazing boyfriend who is finally in town...*they are so made for eachother and im glad that they are finally happy together*...but honestly...a 9th grade sister would be on the bottom of many freshman in college's lists. Im not exactly mad...i just wish i didn't have to face what im facing alone right now. Its like slowly i have started to get pushed out on my own...but not in a way i would have liked. Everything i want to do for myself...having independence having my parents at least trust me somewhat..isn't happening. But facing the raw brutality of what some people have the power of throwing at you all by yourself..well im not completly alone but the few people who are by my side on this, unfortunatly can only offer so much comfort. Getting hit square in the face with things completely out of your control and things that hurt you somewhere inside that u didn't know was in danger of being hurt. Feeling the isolation of trying so hard to do things to make them accept you and trying so hard to live up to what you think their standards are but then finding out too late that you completly missed the mark that they set for you. Its well...honestly its freakin hard to handle. I don't want to sound like im complaining or saying that my life is this horrible mess and i cant believe i have to deal with PROBLEMS! because thats not what im saying. I know i could be alot worse off. I've seen people alot worse off. I just well im selfish. I wish i had the support i used to take for granted. Now that its gone i relize how much i truly leaned on my sister to help guide me in hard times. Now that i think of it im glad she has finally left me to fend for myself. Its time i stop using her to protect me from reality. Im sad to say though...it still hurts me not to be able to share the good things in my life. Its almost harder. Now that she is off with her life...and has...in a sense that no one will probably get except me...has been cut out of my personal life completely i miss mostly being able to run to her when something...or someone...makes me extremly happy. Its unfair in a way that i can no longer do that. But mostly it is selfish on my part. She shouldn't have to deal with being in the middle of me and somethings. Im just sad it was something that would cause this sort of loss. But once again it is me being selfish. I just can't help but miss the fun of sharing happy things with a sister."

"event","Pain and hurt sarrow and shame
the words cut like knives
leaving you to blame

Tears come without control 
crying taking over
body and soul

No one sees what it is we hide
time we spend alone
keeping it all inside

Then one day someone appears
they take your hand
they whipe your tears

They always know what it is to say
they help you laugh
and break away

They've helped you learn so much more
they found the key
to the lock and door

And all along you never knew
what it was you 
could truly do"

"event","Its amazing how things can change in a matter of seconds. You can be going along haveing a rough time and in blink of an eye your world can be flipped for the better. Sometimes good news is just like back news. Well in a way...it sometimes takes awhile to sink in and deal with. I mean it can make you feel amazing but it can also..well i don't know exactly how to discribe it. You get so used to something and learn to cope with it then all of a sudden that fact that was so horrible is gone. Its a great feeling to know its not true...but its weird to get back to the mental state of knowing it didn't happen. Also i've found that things can be going great...but satan always has that one thing he knows he can get you with. Its so hard to over come. He knows its your biggest weakness...and identifying it yourself isn't enough. You have to learn to resist the tempation. He has a way of taking something thats a blessing and using it to trick you into your weakness. Im just glad God has his eye out for me. 

Have you ever had the feeling of just complete not comfort exactly but...a feeling of knowing when something is finally right. Feeling like you could sink into it and stay there forever and nothing could ever come in and hurt you. Its a wonderful feeling. Like two strong arms wraping you up in a hug and telling you over and over everything will be alright...and for once it feels like it. I know from first hand experience just telling yourself what hurts you doesn't matter and everything will turn out fine doesn't always take away any of the pain. Hearing other people tell you it will be ok isn't a comfort when you can see your world crashing around you. But having this amazing secure feeling tell you, even though your life is far from the ideal and far from the perfect fairytale you'd like it to be...everything will...in the end honestly be ok. And then the feeling of believeing it. For no reason that you can understand. You just do. Its an indiscribable feeling and i hope it stays this time. The worst feeling is when your standing on something you thought was strong and firm...and then you feel the gut wrenching jerk of when it drops out from under your unsespecting feet. It takes so long to re-learn how to trust what your standing on. It takes way to long to re-open your heart to people once its been torn in half and sealed shut. But the feeling of when it is re-opened and you can trust things again feels...well i said it already. Indiscribable. 

Hmm...thought for the day...
Today i looked at the mountains. Snow coverd. Majestic and menacing. They are so gorgeous its hard not to lose yourself while you stare at them. Yet i've found living in colorado i often forget to look at them. Always standing watchful in the background. But when you remember to look west and you see them again. Its like seeing them for the first time all over. They never look the same. Its a constant reminder of God and his true power. If you can look at the mountains and think they are there by chance...you are kidding yourself. Nothing that awesome could happen by chance. Or at least i don't believe it could."

"event","Have you ever noticed how life looks like its going one way then blindsides you with something. I never know which way to look. Im expecting one problem and then another i hadnt even thought about BAM! comes out of nowhere. Gosh why do they always have to be hard problems? Why can't for once i just get something that i look at and know right away how to handle it without hurting people or making things worse. But of coarse im stuck between two people i love and care about. One...is more important than the other just by the shear fact of who they are too me ...but the other still holds a place in my heart. I don't know however...where i stand with one of them. I have an idea but im not sure. Even if my idea is right it doesnt change how i see them. But i know it changes things for other people. Humph. I don't know anymore. I mean i know but i don't know how to make things better. Gosh...i've found im scared of so many things...yet at the same time im not scared of anything. HAHA that doesn't even make sense. (sorry for all of you reading this i know im not making sense) At least school has settled down. For the time being. UGH!!! WHY WHY WHY!! The dumpest thing i've ever heard is...smooth sailing. I swear theres no such thing. And if there is..i've never found it! If i just hated him it would make life so much simpler. *sigh* i think im making way to big a deal over something small. I heard a quote once that i really liked ""In the coarse of a lifetime...what does it matter?"" Oh crap...this could matter...but then again it really doesn't. Oh idk maybe it does and maybe it doesnt. It seems every relationship that you have in your life...weather great or small has some affect on you for the rest of your life. Even if you dont know exactly how. Im going to stop worrying about it...we'll see what happens."

"event","So these past few days have been o-some! Well thats because im very lazy and all i did was lay around watching movies, talking on the phone, doing my nails, drinking flavored coffee...you get the idea. BUT i don't feel bad at all for wasting my time because i've been sick! lol. I've decided something else, Im done with advice. I love it that my friends try to help me but in the end i don't want to make a choice based on what someone else has told me. I want to decide somethings for myself. Also i understand its good to look at what possiblitlys there are but at the same time you cant go around scared to try things or not doing somethings with your whole heart just because there is a chance something will go wrong and it will turn out bad. Its more and more our culture is all about go with what you know will work. Take the sesible way. Its less about what do u really want for your life. What would make you really happy. And then you get the people who argue well you can't always do thing just because it will make you happy blah blah blah. Ok. Im talking big things. Like say you really have this dream of being a amazing chef, but instead you take an office job that comes along...and instead of working at your dream still you forget it because you found something easy. See thats what i don't want. I don't want to take all the easy stuff that comes along. I want to live out all my dreams even if they are stupid. Whats funny is people don't seem to relixe that i know its risky and stupid to still dream big but thats not going to stop me from doing it. Think about Martin Luther King jr. He had a huge!! dream! People told him all the time it wasn't going to work and he should forget it and leave things like they are. That didn't stop him from fighting for what he wanted. I know my dreams aren't quite so perfound and world changing but i bet if they were people would still tell me how stupid they were and how unattainable. All i want is to look back at my life whtn im 80 or maybe even 90 and think...wow I didn't waste my life on things that didn't matter. I did something for God that made me happy at the same time."

"event","SO....today was ok...nothing amazing but schools done for break. Thank goodness. Also i totaly made a steal with my white elephant gift. HAHA. Love you chan! So yeah...im still sick but no worries. I think i did well on my Geo and sci finals. Im so glad that drivers ed is over. One good thing that came out of it...besides premit...i met my new awesome friend COREY! lol. Even though he abuses fish...j/k love you core. Wow...i've had way to much chocolate today. Well thats a lie...theres no such thing. So im still confused on what i should do..but im not going to worry about it. That doesnt get you anywhere. I figure...God knows what will happen so i'll let him deal with it. The hard part is...thinking what will be best in the long run. And the Worst part...im still getting to the long run. Highschool is so long but short. Its like...everyone goes through it...but theres no way to make it go by faster. I want to see the end and i want to know where i'll end up...but i know i cant. So i might as well enjoy the ride to getting there. Im just not looking forward to the bumps and scraps that i'll most likely get. I guess though...if it was easy...the outcome wouldn't be half as good. I like working for things i really want...but its hard when your not sure you'll get them. But once again im worrying and looking to far ahead. I do that way to much. I need to enjoy whats going on now...because once its over i can't come back. I've noticed that i do that alot. I forget to live now and i live in the future. What am i going to be doing instead of whats going on now. Im sick of missing my life and looking back and seeing what i missed out on. Hmm...i'll have to work on that."

"event","Why is it that the one thing you really need support on...is the one thing you can't find support for. At least not from the people you want it from. I've found i much rather be helping other people through problems then caught up in the mess that is mine. I think the worst part about it is...seeing how it could turn out...wanting how it could turn out...but not sure you can survive the journey to the end. You know the expression...between a rock and a hard place? Well how about being between a rock and a harder place? Im telling you. Its not fun. I think one of the hardest things is doing something for myself. I just want everyone to be happy. But what happens when you can't make them all happy? What happens when you despratly want to make one person happy...but you also want the other person to be happy. How do u choose. But then i come back to the thought...i can't live without at least trying to make it work...but i don't want to be hated by someone i love so much. BUT! then im back to the other side. How do i hurt the love of my life? Im so stuck...and i can't see a way out. Why is it i don't get credit for the things i do right? I just get punished for the things i do wrong. What happens when i can't give up either?"

"event","i feel like i made the worst descision. when you give your heart away, you have to expect for the worse, because if you don't, you will get let down, and when you do, it only makes the good things better. but i guess i forgot that. February 20th 2004- March 27th 2004. the best 37 days of my life... pretty much. i cant believe i threw it all away. and now, i finally saw what i had done, and its too late. hes doesnt even care anymore. hes moved on. the truth is, if i could move on i would, but i cant. isaac was and is my everything. and what hurts the most as knowing that he doesnt feel the same. if i could go back in time, back to saturday night... i would have never said it was over. i dont know why i did. they say never regret something that once made you smile... well what happened made me cry and i mean isnt that a sign? if i could, id slice my heart but i cant. i cant do anything."

"event","Guess who's been sick all weekend? Yeah, me. We finally get a three day weekend and I'm sick with fever, coughing, sore throat, and lots of snot. Yum. Sick = no fun for Joelle. I didn't even get to go to the store and work. Sick = no money for Joelle. And on top of all that, it's snowing! The first good snow all year and I can't go outside and play, cause I'm sick! No fun for Joelle. No. I have to sit on my lazy butt all day and do nothing but watch movies, suck on Ricola, and use a box of Kleenex every 6 hours! Plus, I have math homework."

"event","Well, sat on my lazy ass all day Friday.
Saturday I went to work at the hardware store for the last time. This creepy middle-aged guy was hitting on me. That was scary. Teenage guys never hit on me, let alone 40 year-olds.
Today I went to the Barboursville Mall with Lauren. Yay. Fun. This weekend I need to go to the mall again cause Justin agreed to let me play dress-up with him. The first thing I'm gonna do is throw some khaki cargo pants and a green shirt at him. Squee! This is going to be so much fun. We all need to go to a movie before school starts as kind of an end-of-the-summer party kinda thing. Yeah. Or watch a movie at somebody's house. Any volunteers? I'd do it, but I can't get my grandma out of the house.
See you kids at band tomorrow."

"event","Yay! Home! Well, I'm not home. I'm at Lauren's, but I was home. Slept for 16 hours straight. At 6:30 yesterday Justin Queen called me. Can you believe that? We had been away for 6 hours and he had to call. But I was asleep and when I woke up the line was busy and this morning no one was home and now he's online but won't IM me back. I guess he didn't need to talk to me that bad anyway.
Band Camp was awesome. I documented everything in a notebook to type in here, but I forgot it at home. 
I'm gonna miss the seniors so much. Last year I didn't really know any of them very well, but I'm closer to these people. Like Ashlynd and Michael. Especially Ashlynd. And it just won't be the same without Brandon. I can't even imagine band without him. Life sucks. 
I'm gonna go eat something and sleep. See you tomorrow kids."

I now have 80 dollars in cash to do what I please with. Can you say mall? I have to go buy a book and a new pair of dress shoes. Last week at the mall I bought a shirt that says Jenny and 867-5309. It's way too small but I had to have it. It was only six bucks, besides, that's my song. 
Not looking foward to band. Well, at least the running part. I'm so fat. And I'm always the last to get back. 
Lauren's favorite teacher died earlier this week. She absolutely loved him. So tomorrow we're gonna go get Andy and stop by the funeral home for just a bit. At least that's what her mom said. It'll be the first time I've seen Andy all summer. Woot. Wow. I never say that anymore.
Oh, and Happy B-Day Michael. Hope you get that guitar."

"event","Sooo busy this week. Helped Naseem finally move out of her grandparents' house. It was driving her and her brother crazy. First, on Tuesday we went to the new house to clean. I swear, those people must have NEVER cleaned. Then Wednesday we packed. Thursday we cleaned and packed and Friday we moved most of their stuff. I was supposed to work Friday, but Carol Jean said it was okay if I didn't come. So Saturday I went to work and it was so hot! One of the air conditioners broke so while it was 97 outside, it was 81 inside. Later Saturday Chris and Katie came to Lauren's, we all went to the fireworks and met Domenica and Aaron there. I was so happy cause I hadn't seen either of them since school. Sunday Chris and Tom went fishing and we went to church. Went to a cookout and swam and played ping-pong and pool. Came back to Lauren's and me and Katie slept. Then everybody went to the store and I said I didn't want to go and I slept some more and the next thing I new, it was morning. So I slept from 6 yesterday to almost 9 this morning. Yay. Later we're going to Wal*Mart, then a golf cart ride and a boat ride. 
See you guys Tuesday at band 6:30 to 8:30!!!"

"event","Lots of stuff to talk about. I just realized I never explained my adventures in Toddler Land. So two weeks ago I went to Lauren's aunt Chris' house to babysit. First it was just the two boys, Baa and Bill. We watched Dora the Explorer and ate goldfish. Then Bill decides to do baby stuff and play with my face and hair. He sticks his finger up my nose and brought tears to my eyes, then he wanted to put them in my mouth. Eww. So then Maddy came and she was hungry because she just had her swimming lesson. So I set all three of them in high-chairs in the kitchen and we ate peaches and green beans and cereal. Then they went outside and played for a while and got tired. So it was nap time. I eventually got all three of them asleep. Maddy was in her room and I was with the babies in the extra bedroom we all piled on and were out. When Chris came home she was so suprised. Acted like I was a god. Yeah, I know I am.
Second thing. Camp. I really enjoyed it. I laughed and cried with those people. And there's this one guy Domenica might know. Maybe, maybe not. His name is Lorin and he's really cool. I'll have pictures from camp later this week and I'll try to figure out a way to put them on here. I have a few of the guys wearing make-up. It was part of our lesson one day. And there's lots of the guys playing guitar. That's pretty much all we did during free time. We sat around for two hours and talked and listened to them play guitar. And Lorin can sing like the guy from AC/DC. Awesome. One day we played faculty vs. camper softball. Faculty kicked camper butt. 22 to 7. But we won volleyball. I was a pretty amazing server if I say so myself.
Oh! I almost forgot! Naseem and her mom found a house! They don't have to live with her grandparents anymore. They aren't buying the house, they're just renting, because their name is still on the old one and it has to stay there until it is sold or else they won't get any of the money. But it has three bedrooms, kitchen, living room, dining room, fireplace, fenced yard and back porch. Naseem said that the people who lived there before must not have ever cleaned so later this week I'm going down there to help clean so they can move in next week. I'm so happy!"

I rekindled old realationships, made them stronger and created quite a few new ones. If I could I would never leave camp, never grow up, and keep all of my church friends there. It'd be my own little Neverland. There's one person in particular that I really grew close to. Her name is Jenny and she lives in Elkins and come to find out, she knows Gareth Taylor. Yeah, it's a small world after all.

Then spend a week in Kentucky. Then band starts on Tuesdays with work during the week and going to Kentucky on the weekends. And after band camp there'll be practice everyday. Then school again.

"event","The computer at my house died which is why I haven't been on forever. I'm at Lauren's right now. So until the computer is fixed, I'll only update on Sundays.
This week was utterly boring. Nothing much happened at all. In fact, I think the only good thing that happened was I got to work on Saturday at the hardware store. So I am now 20 dollars richer.
The only thing good that happened today was I got to eat lasagna and watch The Pirates of the Caribbean."

"event","Ahh! I friggin' hate Mondays.

Slept in today which was cool. But nothing else was good.

But I did need to sleep in. Considering I was up from 3 to 4. I had this horrible nightmare. This sounds so childish, but I've seriously never had one this bad. So I woke up all freaked out. And then I realized I lost my retainer. I still have to wear that damn thing at night so my teeth don't move, but sometimes I take it out in my sleep. So I spent like 20 minutes looking for two clear pieces of plastic in a dark room with dark sheets in a half-asleep stooper. And then I couldn't go back asleep.
Anyways,

So I got to school later than usual. Alex and Justin were fighting again. I absolutely hate it when they do that. Cause then they both want me to take sides. I usually side with Justin cause Alex gets on my nerves almost everyday. Yeah.

Then I got to walk from Baker (1st block) to the other end of the main building (mentor group) back to Baker (2nd) and back to main for lunch. That was so much fun. Oh yeah.

And everybody was talking about afterprom and how I should have went. Who would I have hung out with? Alex and Travis? I think not. Megan and Lynn? Domenica and Aaron? Hell no. So, like get off my back about it guys. Seriously.

Tomorrow better improve or else Wednesday I'm not even going to bother getting up."

Okay. I lied.
It's really not that funny now.
But it was.
You're just gonna have to trust me.
Anyway, here it goes.

How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? One, but the light bulb has to want to change. 

See. Not that funny.

Oh well. I'll get over it eventually.
Billy's still trying to convince me he's in Mexico...... yeah. Sure.
So this week pretty much sucked. But I got a new shirt and jeans. Made me feel better. And Domenica, Justin and I are still trying to plan a frickin' party. Justin and Maggie and I convinced her that the club house totally blows, so the party has been moved to Maggie's house. Awesome.
Tomorrow is Megan and Lynn's Shao-Lin tournament. I'm gonna go and maybe drag Lauren along too. And maybe Andy.
Oh my god, I'm so jealous of Carrie. She's one of the like 5 freshmen going to prom. Alex and I think she's gonna end up getting a date every year. If I can't get a date my junior year I'm gonna ask Andrew if he'll go with me. I like my Andrew. He's like a big teddy bear. With smaller ears. And no tail. And he's not fuzzy. Whatever.
I ripped my cool painted jeans twice on Tuesday. Once in the knee which was really awesome. I didn't even mean to. But then we were walking home and Jeremy like tackled me cause I had Cheetos and they ripped all the way across the top of one leg. So I had to carry my backpack over my ass all the way home. Awesome. But Domenica says she's going to fix them for me. Yay!
Well, I'm gonna go lay around the house some more. Cause I'm bored. And sleepy like woah."

"event","Spring Break started out totally awesome. Lauren's cousins were here, the twins had their birthday party, I got to baby-sit, and of course there was much Easter candy. Aaron and I went walking around Cross Lanes and Kaitlynn yelled at us. Then we both got sick. Then I got sicker after I went to Naseem's. They were having this massive garage sale to get some money to make a down payment on the new house and whatever is left over goes to the piggy bank for a fence. Then Saturday we went back there to help clean for the open house on Sunday. 5 couples looked at the house and we know at least one of them wants to buy it, which is great. For my birthday we went out to eat at the Rice Bowl and then went shopping at Target and Wal Mart since the mall was closed. Today my mom and I are going shopping again. Maybe I'll get a new pair of Chucks......."

"event","*sniff* I wanna go to Florida too!!!!! *whimper* Nobody's going to be here for my birthday. 
I hope we're going out for my birthday again. This year I'm gonna choose someplace that doesn't serve beer, cause last time my grandma got drunk. It was pretty funny, but she talks a lot more when she's drunk. And if you know how much she talks anyway, my god, I wanted to kill her! 
I'm at Lauren's right now because her cousins are here. They're so much fun. 
Later today we are going to Hannah and Grace's birthday party. They're turning one and we bought them the cutest little toys. And they're different toys. I insisted on buying two different toys cause the twins are different. They act different and don't even look alike! I hate it when Monica dresses them in matching outfits. Anyway, the toys are a little Pooh on a Bumble that vibrates when you pull its tail and an Eeoyre on another Bumble that does the same thing. Yeah, they're really cute."

"event","So I went totally out of my mind this week. Will wasn't at school until today. But I really didn't start to flip out until Wednesday, but that's cause NOBODY knew where he was. Everybody was trying to think of what happened to him and they were all like, ""Maybe he died. Maybe somebody he knows died. Maybe he's just really sick. Maybe somebody he knows is really sick. He moved. He went back to Riverside. Oh, maybe he got arrested."" All of that made me feel SOOOO much better, lemme tell ya. And on Thursday I was almost in tears during fourth block and Billy was just sitting there hugging me, telling me he was fine and said, ""He's probably in Mexico, getting drunk on tequila."" So Mr. Lily went to his house yesterday and told Will I was going out of my mind, so he came back. W00t! =)

It's supposed to be a secret. I'm just thrilled to death!!! Lauren and I both want them to be boys. Identical boys. So they can do mean stuff to their older sister. Poor Monica, she only wanted one child. And Hannah and Grace aren't even a year old yet. I hope it's boys..........

"event","I have been pretty busy. Last weekend was fun. The girls and I went for icecream, not before stopping at Samantha's work where I bought a sexy two piece pink bathing suit. I am kinda iffy, but Sam said it looked good. So I will wear it. One night we also went to an environmental film festival and it was a good movie we saw. Later Michelle called and we laughed all the way to GiGis b/c the girls and I got pizza. We then watched Napoleaon Dynamite. I laughed so hard... Later C.J. came by and he was totally drunk on champaigne. He hit on me as we sat on the couch, and poured his heart out about his problems... poor guy won't admit he is either bi or gay. huh.

Sunday I did homework and later Mike came by to work on the project. He is so cute. Yes, its the same Mike I liked in the begining of the year. We flirt so much its hilarious. 

Monday was our presentation and it went great.

Tuesday all I did was study for psych. Later that night when Samantha was at work, her Uncle Frank called and talked to me for an hour. He is her great uncle and lives in florida as a bachelor with a cat. He told me his life story and told me I could be his daughter. He taught me German and talked about every subject out there. Later when Sam came home I was like, ""yeah you should visit your Uncle Frank in Florida with his cat."" She was like ""what?"" She didn't know where or how he got her number. He told me he is one of those people in the family that talks to you for ever and that no one likes to talk to him. I thought it was funny.

Wednesday, today I went to class and Mike and I talked forever.  He was all like ""yeah, so now that our presentation is over, I won't get a million phone calls from my partner."" as he implied that he liked me calling him all the time. I was all like ""awww"" in my head.  In chemistry suitcase man walked in and I turned around to look at Mike. He was looking at me and we were both laughing inside about the suitcase. Yes I knew he was a nice boy.

You must be wondering what happened to Shawn. Well I will tell you. He is more like a quick fad. In one day, out the next. eye candy but cute all the same."

"event","I have said that word a lot today. It was rainy. Bummer. I woke up in the morning, and was planning on wearing this cute outfit, the striped skirt with the peach top and green cardigan that Jennifer picked out for me at H&M, but it was raining. :( So, I wore my green striped shirt from that store Jennifer and I get cheap clothes at. 

I went to lunch, and then went to environmental studies at 1:30 in the afternoon. Boring. Then, I walked out of my class and this girl in my art class was going to give me a lift to the Dali Museum, but she couldn't make it. So, C.J. was going to give me a ride. He is a sophomore, and has brown/orange hair. I sat next to him the first day of class. Anyway, he lives off campus and he his parents are divorced. His parents compete  by giving him cars. First, he had a mini cooper which was rear ended on 275. It was silver with black stripes. Jennifer would have been jealous. So, we approached his car and is was a yellow 2 door sports car, a honda I think or something. He also has a volvo. Albert would be jealous. This car was so beautiful, I felt like a princess. 

So it took us awhile to get to the museum, but we were only like 10 min. late. A new exhibit is opening and my class gets to be invited to the opening. Yippee. It was actualy boring what we talked about.. the bylaws and stuff. ugh. It was fun hanging out with C.J and he swapped numbers before he dropped me off at my dorm. I, honestly think he could be gay. I have a 6th sense for this thing, and well, I am 95% sure. I thought that the minute I saw him, but we will see. Either way, I hope we become friends because he is so easy to talk to.  In fact, he and this other girl were meeting up for dinner and he invited me, but I couldn't b/c of my chem lab at 5.

So, I ran over to Chem Lab in the drizzeling rain and checked in my drawer. I got my homework and we were dismissed early. Yeah!

Then, at home in my dorm and talked to Jennifer online. Samantha and I watched Gilmore Girls, the season premiere. Well, it was good. Dean is back in the picture and he and Rory had sex for the 1st, and 2nd time, although Dean is currently married. I wonder what will come next.

I talked to Michelle on the phone about Gilmore Girls and she said she got a B+ on a math test so they won't bump her up to advanced math. Plus, she lost her tennis game; she said the other players were robots.

I ate a few gold fish and now can feel my pulse beat really hard b/c I had 2 pepsis, and when you don't eat a lot of food and just have Pepsi, it goes right to your brain. Yeah. ok. Now, I might finish my chem I was working on and then do some western heritage stuff. Someone in my dorm is making popcorn and it smells like that every day. We have the window open and the breeze sounds awesome, very soothing. I want to close my eyes and just aaaahhh. Its great. I don't miss the cold. In fact, I have enough here in my dorm. Yes, my dorm is freezing from the a.c and so we have the window open a bit. Thats all. night"

"event","I went to work today, and this black girl came up to me, and asked me where the rest of her tribe was. In her family, there was 7 little black kids, and all were following their mother in a very bright and colorful outfit.  So, I was like, you tribe? And she was like, no the children. Ohhhh, I said, and pointed in the direction the ant line went. It was funny. 

I go home, and wew, its hot. I change clothes and waited for my mom to get done with work. Later, we go shopping for my own stereo, and I love the sound. This guy named Eddie helped us who goes to a college in Arizona. 

So, later, after a long wait in traffic, we go to Michelle's game.  Her team loses to the blue team which includes the Bartos girl, who mom hates. Anyway, after the slaughter rule and all of that fun stuff, Albert calls me up, and we go for a bike ride.

As we rode past the park, Jonathan and his friends were riding past and they began to shout at me. Oh brother. Albert and I rode our bikes through downtown LaGrange, said hi to Jennifer, and then we met some of his stoner friends from high school in the alley.  lol.

So, later Albert got Key Lime icecream, and then we made fun of the old people dancing to weird music in the park. We also made fun the zoo girls.  They have been working too much there, for they act like animals themselves. lol

I went home, and then did laundry, nothing big. Until the next day.."

"event","Yes, I went to the Indiana Dunes yesterday with my cousins.  Michelle and Erin bonded, and I have come to the conclusion that they are 2 weridos on a pod. Don't get me wrong, I love Michelle. But, sometimes she out does herself with weirdness. As usual, my family talked about diets, and L.K. brought up the idea of physical exercise into the picture. Hello! Thank you, someone on the same level as me. Yeah, so I had a great time. We made a sand castle, went up to dunes, swam, played tag, and laughed a whole bunch.

Today, I went to work, and to my surprise saw Rich working, b/c he was supposed to be at the beach. He said he was leaving after work. So, later that day he gave me his email. Yaaaa! He is a nice friend. I had to work with Ali, the girl with the most sass, and after 2 Marylan, who puts black in the word black. She took a 1/2 hour long break and boy did I bitch her out. I was mad. And, what else, oh, I worked with Todd, my friend who plays a fatherly role at home depot, (for me anyway.) He was a writer, and knows a lot. Anyway, so I worked until 6 in the hot blistering sun. I came home, ate for the first time today and watched the show where the mothers switch houses. A black family switched with a white rich family. It was funny.

Later, I talked to Sarah Kiehl online and went to bed. What a day. wew, glad its over."

"event","Welll, today was fun. I woke up, drank like 3 cups of coffee, and watched Sesame Street.  There were ghetto guys playing their music and rap for the kids and Oscsar the grouch. So, after learning about the letter W and the number 5, I went off to work and started at 8.

At work, I saw right away in the parking lot Rich was working, and it made my day because he makes me laugh. Anyway, so I was condensing flowers with my buddy Todd, and  of course Rich. So, after that, along came Trudy, the gal who has white trash written across her forehead and uses food stamps. Well, Rich made the day go by so fast and he told me about how he was going to the beach this week, and I said I was going to, but on a different day. :( 

Well, after work, I drove home and got ready for Jennifer's family to come over. So, I cleaned, played on the computer, and changed clothes.  

Later I went to Jewel where I was in the produce section when every other light went out. So, I continued shopping while everyone else stared at the ceiling, looking for a miracle or something. Anyway, I bought butter, coffee, and stuff like that and checked out, and waved hello to weird Matt. On the way out, I noticed a large red fire truck. Yes, very obvious in the parking lot. There was a live wire down and it was funny.

So Jennifer and her parents came over, and then we ate. While eating, my Mom looked out the window and there was Tiffany sneaking around my front. Well, I yell out to her and I talk to her for a bit. She was dropping off my graduation card, a little late, but ok. :) Thats Tiffany. So, I then have desert and then I leave to pick up Sarah Kiehl.

Sarah and I go to the Contanier Store where we get 20 % off.  The lines were very long, almost an hour wait. We got in line, and shopped to the front of the store. So, after seeing Kristen, and Katy Wettstein who did not say hi to me, we paid and left.

I sped home, and we were just in time for the Brookfield fireworks.  I parked at Jennifer's house, and I amde Sarah run a few blocks to see the fireworks. She did her duck run. lol, (Jennifer would understand.) anyway, we caught the end by the blanket where we wore sun glasses b/c pieces of ash fell on us. 

We went back to Jennifer's house where we played neo pets and listened to music.

Then, I went home and Al was being a meanie online. He said I was a $2 whore. :(
Then we made up the code name bu, butt ugly. At the end of our conversation, he said gtf, which of course means got to fuck. I knew he had someone else on the side.

Oh well, I still have not found my rubber ducky. I wanted to play with him so bad..."

"event","Yes, today I slept in and like, it was nice. I think it was because I took 2 blue excedrin before I went to bed at 2 in the morning. So, I woke up around 12:30 in the afternoon, and watched a good movie, The Man Who New Too Little. Hilarious. So, I took a shower and my mom bought air fair for me to come home from school around Thanksgiving.  And, then, I went to Obbies and picked up the pizzas for dinner. I called Jennifer, and she said she went shopping with her mom and her Grandma.

So, after picking up Jennifer and the pizza, we went to my house and had dinner.  Jennifer and Michelle played neopets for like a half in an hour. Then, I got bored and bugged Jennifer to go, so we went shopping.

First, we went to Linens and Things, and I bought a garbage can and a shark vaccuum, oh , and drawer liners. Then we went to Oak Brook where we looked at Stereos and I bought a pair of jeans at the gap. I was kinda sad I had to buy the 12s b/c the 10 I  didn't like on me, but I could zipper them anyway. oh well.

So then we went to old navy, where Jennifer bought a pair of jammys.

We went home, and I went to the bathroom and changed into a long sleave shirt because I was cold. Then, we took Michelle with to get Frostys, and Jennifer got fries too.  We drove around and then I dropped Jennifer at home.  The weather was great and I had fun."

"event","my mom and I had this conversation about me, and who i am. she, nicely explained to me  how I have an attendancy to overdo my personality when around certain people; a statement of which I agree. As a child, I was always introverted, and for the most part kept to myself and was content.  Junior high was the same, as was freshman year.    My confinement was mostly the result of my weight.  I was always teased and spent many days running home from the bus crying. So I began to build walls to protect myself and as I did, I recreated myself, as if, I try to please everyone around me.  

So this new Stephanie was born in Europe. Yes, in 3 weeks, not only did I shed the pounds, but developed a new personality. I was barely eating, but it didn't matter, for the results were worth it. (Its amazing how much attention you get when you are thin vs. fat.) So, as I was saying, my new self was trust into sophomore year, where I met many new people and really, for me, felt like freshman year in the respect that   I felt alive.  Freshman year I wanted to hide.  So I made new friends, although most  also have a quiet voice.  Jennifer, my friend, for example, was one of the quietest girls out of the group.  As long as I can remember, most of my friends were quiet, and I was the more dominant figure in the relationship. Anyway, so back to Jennifer. We were distant at first, for I still had a lot of walls up.  I don't think we clicked off the bat, no, it was more like I would see her at lunch, and thats it. But, Junior year I realized more of what a friend she is, and the rest is history.  Unfortunetly, we still have this problem about my multiple pleasing personalitites.

When I am around ""loud"" people who tend to be more popular, I am quiet. I make up the difference.  When someone is quiet, like Jennifer, than I am loud and obnoxious.  Honestly, I look back on my behavior some nights and am disgusted with how I acted.  I think to myself, ""I can't believe I acted that way.""  I totally stress my body out while doing so however, all of this ups and downs.  At work, I am so happy it makes me sick sometimes.  I just put on this ""work"" mask and play it up until I punch out.  

So who am I, really then.  No, I am not loud.  And I worry too much and care about every little stupid thing out there.  And I don't want to be the quiet one in the group.  I remember, well, many nights out with Ali and the gang, and I forced myself to say something just so they didn't think I was mute.  Weird. So I went from a quiet girl who said 2 words a night, to this wacky LOUD person who I can't even take. Its amazing I have any friends at all, because I don't know how they put up with it.

Where is my center, and how do I find it eh? I wish it were simple.
Never have my pimples been as bad as they are now.  Maybe because of college, I dunno. But, try to explain my perspiration.  Its not smelly, no. Just like, water. And it is sometimes constant, when on days like today, nothing.  This and my face are directly related to my stress levels and the amount of energy I am forced to expel through out the day.  

So what is the answer?
I hope I find my center soon, before my souffle of a life collapses.

that is all."

"event","I've decided that with all of my down time that I've been having so far this Summer, I should start writing on here again.  

School came and ended this past year, and after transferring to NAU, I know now that I am most happy there.  Often times I feel really bad because I did have a few great friends at Chapman, which I love and miss all the time.  I also felt shitty because I couldn't ever get out to see Krista, which sucked cause she was my BFF out there.  I must make it a top priority to go out there at the beginning of the school year just to see her.  
I am now living back at my mom's house in Tucson for the summer.  I like being at home, but at the same time I've been depressed in the two weeks I've been here.  It's either so effing hot outside that you can't do anything, or too cold/windy/rainy to do anything too.  When it's bad outside, I get groggy and lazy, so that's just been the general feeling.  The other thing is that the whole semester I hung out with my best friends everyday.  Alex, Lauren and Matt were always around, and now they are all away.  Lauren decided to stay in Flagstaff for summer, Matt is in Flag, Cali, and going to field training for the air force in Alabama.  Alex is living with his sister in New Hampshire, which is entirely across the country.  Of course I still have friends here, but I have only seen them a few times and I'm not really the type to initiate hanging out, especially when I feel so crappy all the time.  
I'm seriously on the verge of tears almost every day.  Alex has made an effort to call at least once to three times a day.  I guess that makes me happy, but at the same time, I wish that I could just see him.  Now he has a job demolishing an old opera house, and so I probably wont be able to go out there until at least August, maybe not even at all.  
I've pretty much just spent my time here so far cleaning the house, my room especially, I made a t-shirt quilt, and I got a job.  I haven't started the job yet, but I'm hoping that once I do I will fill up my extra time and summer will just fly by.  I am going to work at this store named Tilly's.  It's at the Tucson mall, and I've wanted to work there ever since I first went into the one at the Block in Orange, CA.  I've actually applied there twice in the past as well.  I got the job on the spot though, and everyone I have met so far seems awesome and really nice. Hopefully it will be fun!
In August I'm going to be going back to Flagstaff...which I'm stoked about because I love it there.  I'm also going to have one of the busiest semesters of my life, which I'm also happy about because that makes life more interesting.  And finally, I'm also happy to say I will be moving out of the dorms!  Alex and I got an apartment together and are moving in on August 16.  I hope that is a good idea, I mean, it was like we pretty much were living together before, now we just don't have to eat cafeteria food, eww.  We are thinking about getting a puppy as well, but due to school and everything, I don't know if that would be a good idea, since puppies and dogs need attention and everything.  
Blah.  I just wish that next week would roll around, and I could start working and stay busy.  Lauren called me today and said that she is gonna come home for a few days Sunday, Monday and Tuesday because she doesn't have to work.  That makes me happy because I totally miss hanging out with her, and it's weird not to have her like 5 minutes away.   
I watched Juno this morning.  Again, I was completely bored.  I fell asleep halfway in and woke up at 3:30.  I think I may be ill or something.  
Peace out, I think that I'm gonna be sick.
Until next time...Gaby"

"event","I'm dating a mountain man, and I've never been happier.

at least I can be happy about that, im still not too thrilled about life here at chapman university, although this weekend was a lot of fun, I still would rather be at home.
I made a new friend, her name is amy, we went to california adventure on friday which was fun.
i went to a couple parties this weekend too, but they get kinda old after a while, since chapman is so small you never really see different people anymore.  it getws boring.

im planning on going to flagstaff on May 4.  I hope i can go, it kinda depends on how much money I have at that point in time...but I hope i can.  i miss my bf so much that it kills me a little everyday.  I have a picture of us, on the wall by my bed, cheesy i know, but every night i look at it and kind of want to cry, i just have such intense feelings for him, feelings ive never felt for anyone before.

it makes me wonder how im going to get through this summer...i know that there will be a lot of time where i wont be able to see him, and im not looking forward to that.  at least i already bought my plane tickets to go stay with him in june, im already excited, and i have a feeling that we will both have the best birthdays ever together (his is june 9th, mine is the 14th, and I will be there for both).

well goodness.  ive slept a lot this weekend too, but i guess i needed it.  im gonna go to sleep now, no art class tommarow (cancelled) woohoo, so i get to sleep in until work at 12.  yay!"

Even more then I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas Eve will find me

I never really thought about this song until this morning.  As I was straightening my hair, I had christmas music blasting on the speakers of my laptop.  The other night I ended up downloading a bunch of punk rock christmas music to play on my radio show this week, seeing as how it's my last show before christmas.  I was playing through the list, and I'll be home for christmas, by Matchbook Romance came on.  of course I was already singing along, but I stopped and just listened for a minute.. yes, i will be home for christmas.  I'm so happy I will be home for christmas.  I will be so happy on christmas, and even once I drive to the airport on the 16th to get my brother, so he can help me drive my truck home for break.. I will be so happy.  I'll be home for christmas."

"event","its a weird and scary feeling when you can taste cigarettes in your mouth after kissing someone, but you only realize it because it's not the kind of cigarette ur used to tasting after kissing someone.  then you sit and think about why u are uncomfortable with the pall mall taste instead of the marlboro taste that should be there.  you realize that the only guy you really want to kiss is the one with the freaking marlboros, not the cheap ass pall malls.  but what can you do when the boy with the marlboros is nonexistant now?  what can you do when the only boy you will ever want to kiss again is mr. marlboro?  what if u have just realized that you are definately in love with the non-existant mr. marlboro? 
i came to this conclusion late last night.  damnit, i dont even smoke."

"event","omg, so i guess last night at skrappys, a huge fight happened, and one guy died.  whoa, im like, scared, i was supposed to go there tommarow night.  
<lj-cut text=""skrappys"">this is from a news site...Last night, at Skrappy's in Tucson, AZ a man in his 20's, was allegedly shot to death while attending a Shattered Realm and Donnybrook show. The fight broke during out between two (or more) groups of people during Donnybrook's last song. Following the fight, the group(s) were thrown out of the venue and that's when all hell broke loose. According to sources, weapons such as hammers, machetes, gun(s) and brass knuckles were involved. Details are vague at the moment and I don't want to accidentally drop names of people who really weren't involved. Check out a video news report on the incident right hereand read a witness account below. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victim... a night of enjoyment should never turn this ugly.

One Person's Account On The Violence At Last Night's Donnybrook ShowSo, donnybrook was playing their last song and they told everyone to move and start dancing so my friends in on my honor run in and like 5 guys from FSU didnt want tucson kids dancing, so they beat the shit out of him.
So these guys from tucson (names removed) jump in to get them off, and (name removed) got his head split open and everyone was fucking eachother up.

Then the lady that owns skrappys got on stage and said thats it the shows over and FSU was like get off stage you fat bitch blah blah, started throwing the speakers on the floor and shit and then said everybody clear the fuck out we've got a machine gun blah blah, so everyone runs outside. Someone from FSU(some people are saying it was the lead singer of shattered realm but idk) chased (name removed) to his car, (name removed) got in and the FSU guy broke his car window open with a machetti and said ""you know youre fucking dead right?"" and (no name) pushed his gun up and shot the guy fired 4 shots.

So everyone in skrappys is in lockdown and they arent letting anyone leave and like, all the FSU guys are staring down the tucson kids talking shit.

And the lead singer of black my heart was talking to my friend (no name)(who witnessed fucking everything) and said he better not say shit to the cops and that if he opens his mouth he's fucked too. ""

This is all I know, everything is still fuckin vague, kids are still in skrappys being investigated

Wednesday as Tucson police were interviewing dozens of witnesses and sorting out exactly who did the shooting, although they did not believe the shooter was on the loose, Batista said. Batista could not release any information about the others who were injured in the fight, but said that there were other weapons involved aside from the gun used in the shooting.<lj-cut text=""skrappys"">"

"event","<lj-cut text=""and God said let there be darkness"">so tonight i went and hung out with one of my exes, along with the guy i sorta like, and another guy im starting to like.  it was fun until the truth came out about what really happened one night in my truck...then it was kinda really awkward.  Also, the pizza incident came to the surface.  lets just say that he wasnt too happy.  
yup, so im confused about what to do about this whole thing.  i mean, i really want to be friends with all these people, but its like, when im around them, the one that i really like acts totally different.  the one that i kinda like has no idea that i like him, and is my ex's bro.  the ex has a new gf now, but then is all huggy and holds me close, saying, ""i still miss you.""  i just dont know what to do.
it doesnt help that all of my friends at school, give or take a few, have bfs and gfs now, and its like, im so left out.  usually im the one with all the guys, but i cant even handle the guys i use to have.  its hard when ur used to something for so long, and suddenly its like...whoa.<lj-cut text=""and God said let there be darkness"">"

"event","AHHHHHHHH. I had such a bad breakdown.  

But hey, at least I finally finished my U of A application...I guess that's a good start.

<lj-cut text=""HoNkInG fEsTiVaL oF tEaRs"">
It all began when I walked into the counselors office, handed her my
recommendation stuff, she tells me, you know you are supposed to get
these in a month ahead? I finally couldn't take it and I broke down.
Massively broke down. It was not fun. I ended up staying there for
about an hour just spilling my heart out about everything that has been
going on. In a way it felt good to finally tell someone else how I feel
and what is going on in my life, but then again, it made me all sad and
depressed. Yea, and then my mom came home and i cried some more. I told
her how I feel about leaving for college, even just going to U of A
dorms or moving out. She cried too. It was just a honking festival of
tears. BLAH. <lj-cut text=""HoNkInG fEsTiVaL oF tEaRs"">"

"event","The Prescott Parade was fun.  Bus ride up was relatively uneventful for me, I had a seat to myself which was nice, but at the same time kinda boring.  We did watch Willy Wonka, which was great... Amber, Lauren and I went to Vicotria's secret at the mall.  We also ate pretzels.  They were ""sinful cinnamon,"" aka, me and Lauren's stripper names.  Haha.  In the room, Ali, Amber and I watched the rodeo, and some other movies, and we had a conversation about sex which was disturbing.  Oh, and Alicia came to the hotel to see me since she had to go to phoenix Saturday and couldnt see me after the parade.  She blatantly told me that she doesnt like Daniel, which was sad cause he was sitting next to me.   In the morning Lauren came to our room, and Amber started to act insane.  It was rather funny if you ask me.  Parade went as usual, I saw my friend Monica who is in the Bradshaw Mountain HS band.  After the parade I changed and watched the end of it with my mom, g-ma and aunt.  Afterwards we just looked around prescott, somehow ended up at sonic, and saw some skater boys who were really hot.  I had to get out of the car to go get ketchup, and they were sitting at the table, and they told me i was hot...aww.  Afterwards...it was cold...courthouse lighting, sleep, breakfast, santa, drive, thrift, in n out, home.  It was all a blur. 
Somehow I managed to buy 2 bowling balls, a yoda christmas ornament, a cell phone cover, and a keychain.  Dont ask.

"event","Okay this is for all newbies so if you're already on my friends list up until 11/17/06 disregard this message, or read it if you get confused by what I am talking about a lot in my entries. 

I am constantly getting IMs asking me to explain who the people are that I mention in my journal. I'll just list the basics because those are the ones I mention the most. 

<b>BELOW UPDATED 07/8/07</b>

<b>People:</b>
1. Jack- My roommate. My best friend. He's gay so that is why some of the things he says might be considered odd for his side of the sex. He and Kat(see below) are twins but complete opposites. I buy porn for him to get him to do housework. He handles all calls and scheduling for my job.
2. Kat- My other best friend. She's not my roommate. Currently married and expecting a baby. She's very uptight but I love her anyway, she's like mommy to me and Jack. She was my first friend after I moved to S.F.
3. Kevin- The only person I've ever been in a serious committing relationship with. I loved him, I still care for him, but I don't really see myself with him anymore. He goes to UCLA now but we visit each other. Read past entries if you really want to find out about this person and my past with him.
4. Lacey- The girl you owe the reason to why I am here. My first sexual expirience ever in my life and the one that made me...well me. Read the past entry titled Lacey to find out more about her. Currently a fuck buddy.
5. Courtney- My Eliza Dushku look-a-like fuck buddy.
7. Curtis- I just began to see Curtis in the summer of 2007. He was originally a client who hired me for a social event but after asking me out on a real date, we began to see each other regularly with out pay. He's a great fuck. We keep our relationship to a closer than fuck buddies but we don't consider to be dating each other. He's rich, and just a good fuck and thats what I keep reminding myself to keep from getting too close. He's thirty-one, and currently spoils me.

<b>Places</b>
1. Mezzanine- The club I frequently attend
2. Academy of Art- The school I currently attend. 
3. Work- It can pertain to two things, My job as the receptionist at the salon(since I was 16) or my job as an escort(will be referred to a lot as appointments).
4. S.F.- I currently reside in S.F. and I don't think I plan on really leaving here for awhile. I've lived here since I was younger.
5. O.C.- Yes I did live in the O.C. no I was not familiar with Mischa Barton. It was before I moved to S.F. My mother got a transfer for work so we moved closer.

<b>Don't comment on this to get added. You won't get added if you do. That's what the friends Only Entry is for.</b>

<lj-cut text=""F.A.Q."">
<b>Who do you work for as an escort?</b>
I work through myself. My roommate which is Jack as you have read above is the person who takes care of handling my schedule of everything. He also makes sure all the money gets deposited. He answers <i>all</i> calls from the seperate line which I had set up for work. He get's paid 10% of what ever I make. 

<b>I was wondering if I could take you up on your services?</b>
No! I will not meet online people as clients. If I wanted clients from the online world I would have a website set up wouldn't I?

<b>How many clients do you hold?</b>
As of August 8, 2007, I have counted up to about 35 regular clients. 

<b>How many people have you had sex with?</b>
Honestly I do not know. I can estimate it to over 150 partners. 

<b>Do you have any sexual limits?</b>
Yes...I will <i><b><u>NOT</u></b></i> do beastiliality, illegal ageplay, child porn, child prostitution, I don't condone actual incest, completely hardcore bdsm, piss/scat/feet. Also multiple partner sexual situations literally bore me. I have many rules of sex that I live by as well. If you really want to know that IM me. 

<b>Were you ever molested or in anyway abused as a child?</b>
FUCK NO!!! My parents were never around much when I grew up but that has nothing to do with my choices in my life. All sexual acts I have participated in are completely consensual on both sides. When I was in high school, I did have sexual relationships with men and women over 18 but again it was all consensual.

<b>Don't you ever feel bad for what you do? You have sex just to help you get off. You use people to fit your needs?</b>
Right off the bat...I have never had any regrets. Little ones but nothing I have regretted so far. I don't give a shit if I actually fuck you and leave you five minutes after your done without a single thought. If you have a problem with my 'heartless bitch' personality/behavior you need to get over. I'm not going to tone my life down or conform to your standards just because you don't like it. 

<b>What is the most wildest thing you have done?</b>
Pick a year. 

<b>When did you lose your virginity?</b>
15th birthday. Fucked the popular senior football player who was in a relationship with another woman and I didn't really give a shit. I was just using him to lose my virginity, and he was just using me to have sex. 

<b>Do your parents know what you have done?</b>
They both know I'm sexually active, but they do not know to what extent. They don't know I am an escort. The only family member that knows is my cousin who I'm close to(In no sexual way!!).

<b>How long have you been an escort?</b>
I started Decemeber of 2005 in the middle of my senior year. Yes I was 18.</lj-cut>"

I am re-doing my buddylist. This just means I'm taking out people, that don't belong there. People who asked me to put them on my buddylist but never bother to communicate with me or sign on. </center>

I'm only keeping a choice few:
-Michelle
-Tena/Sex Kitten
-Bill
-John/Sugar Daddy

It doesn't mean that these people are the only ones I will talk to, feel free to IM me anytime. However, it does mean that these four and those that comment to this entry and I allow, will be on my buddylist.

The rest if you wish to be put on my buddylist, who I will IM/talk to regularly, fill out this. Those four that I listed up there...you certainly don't have to fill it out.<b>This doesn't mean that I 'play' regularly or trade pictures.</b> Those four I only play with and it's rare, even. <u>ALL COMMENTS WILL BE SCREENED</u>

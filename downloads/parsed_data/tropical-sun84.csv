So I'm just sitting at the library waiting for my shift to end because again the other worker here felt it necessary to delegate parts of my job to her shelving students and I've been sitting here for 45 minutes.  So I figure why not update?

Wedding plans have been put on hold until mid-summer because Joseph got hired into AT&T and will be leaving to go for out-of-state training in 3-4 weeks, so we're focusing on getting all his schooling done so he can turn everything in early and still pass.  Then we're both out of state until mid-June.  WoOt!  I'm excited and so is he.  This will really help us out financially once I get another job.

Second -- due to pricing, I'm limiting the sorority members who expressed coming to my wedding to no guests.  The others will be there to hang out with.  I know this will sadden some of you, but Joseph and I just can't swing it.  We're going for less than $8,000.  I still love all of you though!

Weight loss is going horribly.  I'll lose a pound each week for about 3 weeks, then put anywhere from 3-5 back on.  I'm not doing so hot.  I do Baugua (fighting Tai Chi) for 90 minutes once a week, Cardio Kickboxing for 20 minutes once/week, 40 minutes (different workout completely) once/week, and circuit training for 60 minutes once/week.  Also, I eat between 1800-2100 calories a day.  I'm going to be meeting with Hot Melissa sometime next week after the craziness of this week/weekend passes to see what else I can do.  It's quite depressing, but I haven't cried yet.

Hmm, what else.  Oh yes, there are only 4 Tuesdays left of classes after today.  WAHOO!  I'm so friggen excited.  My Girly is taking summer classes so she won't be able to visit me in Ottawa, and Yosf and Papa will both be out of state for AT&T so they won't be visiting me in Ottawa either.  Poo!  Ah, well...more time to work on my French since I'm hoping to be placed with a member of the Parti Quebecois!  WoOt!

But, MeLCat is here, so I must go do something....FINALLY!

Much Love to All!  : *"

So I've been sick with a double ear infection since Sunday.  What a way to ring in the New Year eh?  At least I was having a good time with Mexican Friend in IN.

Got some good things for Christmas, mucho excitamundo.  : D

Resolutions for the New Year:

1) Attempt to slim down as I'm getting married in a little under 15 months
2) Learn to deal with the ""mood swings"" in my house until I can earn enough $$ and find a resonably priced place to live.
3) Not go overboard on spending on my wedding. [I foresee many arguments about this one]
4) Kick @$$ in school and get my GPA up again (currently at a 3.26 or something like that).

Tried wedding dresses on whilst I was in IN with Crystal.  It was good fun and made me excited.  I was so pretty.  Put some stuff on my wishlist, and I'm going to look in local stores over spring break to see if I can find something that screams ""HEATHER! I AM THE ULTIMATE DRESS POUR VOUS!""  Because as of right now, nothing is really sticking out to me.  I have really no idea what this perfect dress is, so that's a good thing as in I'm not looking for something that may not exist.

I'm off to bath now because my sleep schedule is f-ed up thanks to vicoden and I MUST stay awake all day today in hopes of sleeping tongiht.  Classes start Monday, and even though I'm on sleep deprivation, I cannae wait as I'll have an excuse for everything!

Much Love to All!

P.S.  I joined a community on here in FRENCH!  AHH!"

He doesn't really want to move back home and I don't blame him.  His dad's motto is:  ""Until your name is on the f*cking deed to the house, you have no say about what I require from you and what goes on here.""  That said, Joseph is an outlet for his dad's frustrations about everything including Joseph and therefore feels the brunt of everything there.  He also has to do more work around the house than his brother or his mother because he's ""the oldest son,"" and is expected to pick up all of Nick's slack lest he want his dad yelling at him for about 45 minutes.

That said, Joseph can put about $150-175 forward on rent during the months of January-April, and can put $200 forward on rent for the rest of the year [he pays 4-Wheeler insurance the first four months].  If you know anyone who has a room for rent and/or is looking for a roommate, please drop me a line.  We're hoping he doesn't have to go back home, because they really don't want him to come back home either.

<lj-cut text=""Softball Again"">

So sunshines, I have about had it up to my limit with the silliness going on at softball.  The situation as most of you know is as follows:

Gary paid for our league dues (not sure why, probably so more people would play because it would be cheaper).  Cliff is Gary's son.  Joseph offered to coach/run everything because Gary said he didn't really have the time.  Joseph & I get rosters and find out he's co-captain with Cliff.  Okay, we're cool with that.  Joseph tries to talk to Cliff and Cliff pretty much pushes everything back on Joseph citing ""not a lot of time.""  Okay.

1st practice, no Cliff.  He comes to the game and tries to change line-ups and field positions based on how he wants it to be.  Doesn't fly because he shows up half-way through the game because he over slept.  Real good role model there co-captain.

2nd practice, Cliff shows.  Comes to the game and changes line-ups and field positions while Joe & I are on the field warming up.  Submits it and it stays that way.

3rd practice, Cliff shows, doesn't do much.  Game time comes today and he wants to put in me in Right field (waste of my abilitiy) and put our weakest girl hitter in the number one girl spot.  Does that make logic to you?  Why would you put an almost guaranteed out as your second batter?  And he put himself as third because that's your strongest player and he believes he is such, and there are other guys out there that maybe don't put it at the fence when the hit but they are way more consistent with hits and actually on base.  Get over yourself.

So also at today's game he tried to keep telling me where to stand in the outfield so I could catch the ball.  Mind you, ever ball that came at me (and they were all grounders) were in front of me and I got every single one of them to my cut off catcher.  Don't tell me how to play Cliff-who-misses-the-ball-trying-to-be-macho, and on top of that you move in on a girl simply because she's a girl and she blasts it over your head.  Dumb @$$.  Not all girls are weak like you think and need to play only Right field, Catcher, and 2nd base.   Good Lord.  Oh, and I was the first girl to get pulled to warm the bench so ""everyone else gets a chance"" yet I was one of the stronger players on the field.  Does that make sense?  Why not bring out your weakest player and rotate that?  I was trying to see if I would be the only one who got pulled as extra evidence to back my case up, but one of our team members got hurt, so our extra girl was automatically put in.  So my question is this:  Do I call this all out at practice and clear the air?  I think that he (with his dad's backing) are trying to punish Joseph and as an added bonus are using me to help that as well.  Or do I let this go and wait until Cliff tries to tell me how to play outfield again and go off on him mid-game or practice?  I knew saying something after the game today was appropriate because other teams were around, but seriously if this kid says something one more time I'm going to flip out on him.  And I think I'm going to read up on softball strategy to see what I can learn.

And now that Melissa is going to hate that I have a ridiculously long paragraph if she read this, I'm going to end it here and go off to spotch; it's been a long day and I'm working ""hard"" tomorrow at the library.

Super busy summer this year with Sarah graduating, 2 vacations, a wedding, my 1 yr anniversary with Yosf [things are MUCH improved for those who were priviledged to know], and moving Sarah to MSU.  OMGZ there's like a total of 2 or 3 weekends were I have one day free. Ah well, at least I'll keep moving.

Weight update.  So after 1 week on the Turbo Jam 10-Day Kick Start diet, I managed to lose 2 pounds and 2% body fat according to my scale.  Not that the numbers matter so much, because I was able to wear jeans again for the first time in 3 weeks!  It's just one pair, but it's an improvement nonetheless.  I'm sure I would have fared more towards the goal of ""upto 10 pounds or 10 inches in 10 days"" had I actually done the recommended workouts, but I couldn't keep up with the speed of the video and felt like I was dying so I had to drop down to the 30 minutes video.  Not bad overall.  I'm still exercising and I'm happy with it so far.  YAY!

Waiting on grades to find out my GPA's.  Hopefully those will come out today.  Hip Hip Hoorah!"

"event","Bonjour Mes Soleils!

Just writing another update for y'all. Whilst I'm on the phone with Yosf and working on my economics homework.  So I e-mailed my cousin about this whole shoelessness thing, and she turned it around that it was just a suggestion.  I'm so confused now, but apparently we'll be wearing shoes.  I talked with my Girly, and she too said that it sounded more as a definite thing than a suggestion.  Which, I guess it works out now that it turned out to be a suggestion, because basically her entire mom's side of the family (the family we share by blood) was going to boycott her wedding and pull everyone out of it that was in it (myself, my sister, our cousins: Crystal (flower girl), Joseph (ring bearer), Jacob and Lucas (ushers).

Another update about the wedding, her bridal party keeps changing.  Originally it was 5.  Then two dropped out, then we added one back.  Then that one dropped out and we added a different one back.  Then I get notice this weekend that we've added another 5th person, Josh's cousin Marissa because she was originally supposed to be the flower girl, but they couldn't get a response from her, so that enlisted my cousin Crystal, but Marissa surfaced, so they're making her the 5th bridesmaid because Josh would drop on of the groomsmen (2 of which are Nikki's brothers and could have been dropped no questions asked especailly since her older brother is also walking her down the isle) so because she's 10 years old, they're going to print off a picture of our bridesmaids' dresses and take that to different stores and try to find a more child appropriate dress to fit her.  I just wish them the best of luck matching the colors and style.

<lj-cut text=""Our Dresses"">
This is the correct color for our dresses too -- it's Apple.

<img src=""http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/TropicalSun84/Bridesmaids.jpg"" alt=""Dresses"" />

I think I may be one of the few who actually like my dress, and if it comes in in time and I can get the alterations done, I may be wearing it to formal. HOOAH!

"event","Howdy Sunshines!  I write to you from the SOM lab because we got out of DS300 early and I've got about 30 minutes until my marketing class starts and a big bunch of nothing to do.  Hooah...not so much because the amount of homework I have this weekend is ridiculous.

SCHOOL:
So I'm so totally excited that school is basically over with.  I have 2 French papers (one grammar, one cinema), 1 French grammar final exam, 1 statistics exam, 1 economics exam, and 1 marketing exam left to go.  I also have 1 more statistics assignment and quiz, and 1 more marketing quiz till I'm done.  I'm way excited.  Should get all A's and B's this semester.  WoOt!

HOME:
Girly's show was good so I heard, I didn't actually go becuase she was sick, but I'm sure they did an excellent job.  Girly and I watched Memoirs of a Geisha and I highly recommend it to anyone!  Momma and Papa are both doing well too.  YAY!!

BOYFRIEND:
Things were a bit shakey for a bit because I laid it all on the line, but Yosf and I are improving and pretty much doing well.  He's now living in my grandfather's house because kids were vandilizing it and that was causing it not to sell well, in addition to the crappy economy right now.  But, it has helped him be less stressed because he's not dealing with his family.  It'll be 8 months exactly today (4/13).  :D

HEALTH:
Well for those of you who don't know, last Tuesday night/Wednesday morning I was at Wyandotte Hospital for severe vomiting/abdomin pain.  They discharged me saying that they weren't really sure what caused it, but that I should follow up with my PCP (duh!).  Basically, everything I was consuming (and I was on a bland diet) was causing me excruciating sharp/burning pains and nausea.  I went to my PCP on Thursday and he sent me immediately for an ultrasound which came back medically okay.  Thus, I was told to continue taking the stomach syrup for the weekend, and I'm on one nexium a day for the next 30 days at least.  I was to call if my symptoms didn't improve by Monday, which they did, but I'm still having issues I think.  I'm going to give it another week to get straightened out before I call again.  I still don't feel like I'm digesting my food properly (when I threw up last Tuesday it was food from a few days before) and it doesn't exit my system like it's supposed to.  Hopefully it won't be too serious.

That said, since I got bronchitis/respirtory infection, I've not worked out much...not that it matters too much if you're taking 3 days to get rid of food, because then the it's just sitting there and you're not getting the nutrients you need so all you want to do is sleep.  I'm hoping it's just stress related, and starting next week or possibly the week after, I'm going to get going on my TurboJam DVDs that finally came in.  I'm way super excited because it's kickboxing mixed with Brazilian martial arts, and I <3 kickboxing.

NIKKI'S WEDDING:
I really thing this thing is going to be crazy nuts -- thank goodness I'm old enough to drink so I can drink the night away.  First off, it took us forever to get the date set to go dress shopping.  We finally go, and myself and Stephanie received two different colors of ribbon to match to.  Are you freakin' kidding me?  So we found a style that flattered us all for the most part and it came down to color.  The technical name of her ribbon color is ""wine,"" but when we saw the wine colored dress for our style, it looked like a deep plum color.  We voted for ""apple,"" but that looks really red.  Also, she plans on having pictures of Chuck (the man who was in her life long enough to be known as 'dad' but is now deceased) and her maternal grandparents (neither of which she had a good relationship with and she didn't speak to her grandfather for about the last 6 months of his life) stuck in her bouqet.  I'm going to try and talk her out of that one, because it'll look trashy.  Also, she's getting discharged from the NAVY (honorably nonetheless) because she can't handle it.  This will be final no later than June 1, at which point she'll move back home to Indiana to work (because she's still a co-lesse on her apartment, she has a car payment, her loan payment for the wedding, and the layaway payment for the wedding) until she's married on June 30.  She'll go on her honeymoon (camping on 4th of July weekend -- without reservations as far as I know!) and then move back to Virgina with Josh to live with a mutual friend for 2 months until he ships out.  Then she'll move back to Indiana to work while he's gone.  In my opinion, that's not how married life works, and I've got my own opinion on that.

Other than that, I think things are doing decently well.  But I'm going to go because I've got about 10 minutes to stop at the bathroom, go out to my car and drop my bag off so I can possible sneak out of class early if it's boring, and get back up to class without being late.

Much Love to All Sunshines!"

<I>Michigan will launch a 30-day speeding ticket frenzy. The state 
estimates that 9 million dollars will be generated in speeding tickets. 1 
million will go to pay state troopers overtime. There will be 50 state 
troopers on duty at all times patrolling the 6 main intersections and 
highways. 

I-75 north and south
I-94 (from Ann Arbor to Port Huron)
E ntire length of I-696
I-275 north and south
M-10 Lodge Fwy 
I-96 from Detroit West to M-14

Now, 5 mph above the limit can justify a ticket and every state trooper 
is supposed to pull a car over and write a ticket every 10 minutes. 
They have issued 30 brand new unmarked Crown Victoria cruisers and they 
are bringing all their part timers on full time. If you work anywhere in 
the Detroit Metropolitan area, you must take one of there interstates, 
routes, or parkways. It's up to you how fast you are doing when they 
do. 

We ar your seat belt, nothing hanging from the rear view mirror, do the 
speed limit (not a mile over) use cruise control if you have it, no 
cracks in your windshield, use your turn signals. </I>

Hope it helps you all!  :D"

"event","Evening sunshines.  Well this'll be sort of a quickie since I'm aiming to be in bed in 5 minutes with computer shut down.

SCHOOL:

I overwhelmed with exactly how much work is required for 15 credit hours.  2 French classes, plus a perfectionist Stat teacher, and marketing, with a little economics thrown in is crazy...and it's only the end of week 2 so nothing really big has started anyways.

I cannot wait to be done.  However, I must say that in French 302 -- excuse me 399 -- I definitely prefer the way Spoiden runs the lecture on the text better than Madame Eschrich.  That said, I'm glad she's doing the grammar part.  For those who don't know, French 302 was cancelled by the not-so-lovely CASL administration because they can't seem to get the purse strings under control and have excess spending to the point that the cut 38 undergrad classes before registration began, and have since then cut ""unnecessary"" classes that had fewer than 15 students.  Sorry folks, 302 is necessary for french majors/minors.  But that's okay we're all doing it as an independent study.  Boo-yah!

BOYFRIEND:

Things are going great with Joseph.  We've had a few heated discussions about dependency and suffocation, and of course my usual bout with my weight, but we're doing good sitting at 5 1/2 months.  YAY!

NIKKI:

Yes I'm putting her in here because she's getting married to Josh (after knowing each other for 9 months kind of, and actually only dating 3).  I'm going to keep my mouth shut other than the fact that I'm the maid of honor, and my Girly's standing too.  I'm not so sure about the dresses, but we'll see once I get to try one on.  They're red and black and I'm not a red person, so I don't know about this one.  The wedding is scheduled tenitively for 6/30 because she actually hasn't called and reserved a location yet, so I'm not sure if we'll actually be having a wedding or not.  No comment.

LIFE IN GENERAL:

I'm on another weight-loss kick, especially since the wedding announcement.  Plus, I think I'm beginning to look a bit blueberry-ish.  I'm pretty much stuck in my current workout regime until after 1/29 because that's the weekend of S&E and Initiation, so my time is filled otherwise.  I do usually squeeze in about 30 minutes 3x a week.  Not too shabby, eh?

Anywho, I missed my mark by 6 minutes so far, so I'll end it here.

Bon Soir Mes Soliels!
Beaucoup Amour!"

"event","Evenin' sunshines!  It's about 11:30, and I'm off to bed soon.  Right now it's time for an update:

1)I've been seeing a chiropractor for the last week or so.  I've got 4 pinched nerves (2 in the lumbar [lower] spine, and 2 in my neck region).  All are fixable without any of the going-under-the-knife-ness, but I'm restricted in what I do.  I have to ice for 30 minutes every hour if I'm having pain.  My lower back has improved significantly, and my upper back/neck region is no starting to feel a lot of strain from the rearranging that's going on.  I'm limited in my exercising -- I can do walking and light cardio as long as I'm not having any pain, which for the past week has been few days.  I'm on a 3 times/week for 6 weeks visit plan and then if I've improved enough it'll drop to once a month.  Also, I've have trauma to my spine, and I have some type of nodes in it that will guarantee me arthritis in my lower back in old age.  Basically, your vertebrae are supposed to look like rounded squares when viewed from the side; mine have straight sides and crooked/uneven tops and bottoms.  Yee-haw [insert sarcasm here]!

Christmas was great; I got:
Some jewelry, a new purse, socks, garnier fructis products, HP legos, GOF game, HP Scene It?, a sparkly shawl, Snoopy with changeable clothes, Rachel Ray cook book.  From Joseph's parents (I about wanted to kill them all for this because I didn't have gifts for them -- yet I did not kill their joy and graciously accepted) I got a gift card to BBW, a nice button down red sweater, a verigated purple/black scarf with purple gloves.  From Nick and his girlfriend Brook (see above parenthesis) I got NE Patriot socks and pull-over hat.  From Joseph I got the Holiday Collection DVD Set of Charlie Brown (Thanksgiving/Election, Christmas X2), and the best gift this year -- a #12 (Brady) NE Patriots jersey.  I will tell on myself here, I cried like a little girl over it because I've been wanting one for about 4 years and I've been too damn cheap to pay for it.  I heart him lots!  I gave him a camo tied fleece blanket that was backed with black fleece, and I'm helping he redo his room this coming weekend.

Anywho, I'm off to go potty.  Happy holiday wishes to all...and if you want to see something funny....

I'm updating because I'm wasting time before I start to get ready for work.

This past weekend we <I>finally</I> picked up our Christmas tree.  Hip hip hoorah!  Hip hip hoorah!  It's pretty much decorated; I think when I get home I'm going to close the floor on that and take the remaining decorations down to the basement.  I'm tired of the boxes being in the living room.  Because guess what...as usual, I busted @$$ cleaning the house up on Wednesday and Thursday, and other than the fact that there are now Christmas decorations out, you can hardly tell.  Geez.  Why did I even bother?  Because I feel like a better person now I suppose.  Except in the mess we're missing 2 things: 1)My momma's digital camera.  We took it Christmas Tree shopping on Saturday, and I brought it home and set it on the table; now it's nowhere to be seen.  2)Very important papers saying my dad hurt his back at work so that he doesn't have to take more sick leave to get things legally fixed.  Geez again!

So life in general has been good.  I finished up classes last week, and as of this morning at 10:25am, I have an A- in Accounting 299 and tha's all I know.  Mind you, I took my OB final on November 30, and my French final was on December 12.  It is now December 19...wtf mate?  Econ final is tomorrow.  I'm quite stoked that I'll most likely receive the usual C (75% on the dot).  Therefore, I'm not expending too much energy studying.  HA!

Hmm, today is my last day of work until January 5!  YAHOO!  That's excitin'!  Too bad it's my monster shift of 6 hours.  Now normally, I wouldn't complain about a 6 hour shift, because 1)it's only 6 hours 2)I'm getting paid for it.  However, there is like <b>no one</b> to serve in the library at this time.  Pretty much I just sit there all day after reshelving the returned books and shelf reading.  *sigh*  And of course, today is a day when I'll be working with my least favorite supervisor.  *sigh* again.

Papa just came back from work; they found his paperwork...so I'm not sure why he's home again.  He's on the phone right now.

Girly is doing good as always...this is her last week of school before the holiday. YAY!  She and I are going shopping for Papa and Momma after I get off work because we have tonight, Thursday night, Friday night to get it done.  BAH to college for taking up all my time so that I cannot go shopping pretty much before classes are done because I have no life.

Things with Joseph are going good.  I spent yesterday with his family; it was kinda weird being over there literally all day after church, but they mentioned that is something they'd like to see more of, so since I heart my man, I oblige them.

So today when I logged on, my SBCYahoo! News brought up that Good Morning America showed the latest JIBJAB clip, the ""Year 2-0-5 In Review""  How about hilarious!  I've decided that JIBJAB is one of my new favorite sites.

Anywho, I'm off to start getting ready for work now.

"event","Well, maybe if it'd snow it would.  Afternoon sunshines!  I'm sitting in my accounting classroom listening to *NSYNC's Home for Christmas cd because class is about to start in about 12 minutes and I was too lazy to upload the WNIC site again.  I've been studying for my accounting quiz that's today.  I'm not so sure I'm going to do as well as I usually do on this one.  I'm having a hard time remembering things.  Perhaps if I wasn't sleep deprived, that would help.

So I had my semesterly (is that a word?) break down last night.  I cried, and cried, and cried.  I cried so much I still felt like I needed to cry but there were no more tears there to come out.  It was sad looking.  However, now that I've finally gotten it out (sometimes you just need your momma) I feel quite refreshed and I'm ready to kick @$$ on my econ paper.  I'm going to write about EPA agreements and the most current ones the EU is having with Africa, the Caribbea, and the Pacific countries.  Hopefully it'll turn out super stellar.  WoOt!

Hmm, I'm still trying to go pick up Nikki for leave.  It's about a 12 hour drive (her base is the Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk) and 704 miles.  My car won't make it that far, so I'm thinking about asking momma to borrow Mrs. T.  I doubt she'll let me though because she probably won't want me driving that far by myself.  I think I'd be fine.  Perhaps, maybe she'd let Joseph go with me if he wanted to make it a weekend trip because I'd have to leave early Saturday morning and then turn around and leave as soon as I picked her up Sunday because I work Monday afternoon from 1230 - 630.  What do you all think?  Should I try and do it?

Anywho, my teacher's walking in, so I'll just end this one here.

1. Go into your livejournal archive.
2. Find your 23rd post. (or for new lj'ers make it ur 5th post - this shall be the new law and all shall obey it.)
3. Find your 5th sentence (or closest to it.)
4. Post the text of your sentence in this post along with these instructions.

This is from my 23rd post of 2004, and I remember not being able to post it before, so I'll post it now:

""As of Wednesday night, I knew for sure that D Phi E wasn't for me (nothing against any Deephers reading this -- I still love ya!)""

This is from my 25th post of 2005 because the 24th and 23rd posts didn't have content to them (just quizzes):

""He could have answered anything else, but he told me 'I don't know.'""  This was in reference to Scott.

So weekend update.  I was out of town for the weekend.  It was decent.  Too much homework for me as always though.  And I get back and I notice that things were apparently decided on sometime over the holiday about the Raffle.  When were people going to clue me in?  I mean I don't want to sound like a b*itch, but I'm the chair of the committee it's kind of important that I know these things.  So, this evenings finance meeting will be talking about this and I'm sure some people are going to hate me for it.  Ah well, it's not the first time.  *rant like woah*

Also, I'm going to question about the copies...do we get to make up the flyer or does CE make it up with the information that's given to them?  I'm just curious because that place seems to give us crappy banners and I'm wondering if it's us not supplying what they need or if they're cheating us our 15-minutes of fame.

Tonight's meeting is likely to be long; we have voting to do and pinning of one NM at the current time.  *sigh*  I was hoping for a quick night because I've got beaucoup homework to do.  I misunderstood my OB teacher and I need sources for that paper and just not my opinion/textbook crap.  It's due Wednesday and it's gotta be 6-10 pages.  Also, I've got a french test on Wednesday with beaucoup grammar, and my econ paper is due next week and I still have no idea what I'm going to write it on.  *SIGH*

I guess that's all for now, I'm going to see if I can find some sources for OB and then eat my lunch before I start my what-seems-like-never-ending 6 hour shift up at the circulation desk.  Oh how I wish 1)I did't have to work or 2)I had a better job because this place stinks!  Last week my wonderful supervisor *cough* not-really *cough* wasn't going to tell me that they had the Friday shift filled already.  I would have been pissed if I had gotten up and dragged myself up here and someone was already here to open.  I think I honestly would have clocked my drive time and argued it all the way to the top.

Ah well, I'm not going to turn this post into a b*itch fest.  Much Love to All!

Oh, and I'm getting sick.  Geez."

TEN WAYS COLLEGE IS LIKE PRESCHOOL:

1. You cry for your mother. [yep - for 2 hours!]

2. You cross the street without looking for cars. [people still have to snatch the back of my jacket so I don't walk out infront of oncoming traffic]

3. Snack time is a necessity. [I carry them around with me always!]

4. You bundle up for the outdoors without caring what you look like (because everyone else looks just as stupid as you do). [today I've got my denim jacket complete with mittens/scarf/hat set]

5. You stay at home and play games with your friends. [or just stay at home because I'm too tired/poor/busy to go out]

6. You wear your backpack on both shoulders. [it's because of all the freakin' weight I carry around; I'd tip over if I left it on one shoulder.]

7. You wear big mittens. [I have 3 pairs of mittens....HAHAHAHAHA]

8. Playing in the snow is a legitimate activity. [hasn't it always been?]

9. You take naps. [every chance I get to the annoyance of my significant other]

10. You look forward to grilled cheese sandwhiches. [who doesn't? -- they go great with Raman noodles too, the other college staple!]

I ""borrowed"" this off a friends Facebook wall and decided to post it here for you all to see.  Now I'm off to catch the short bus back to main campus because Eschrich said she'd be in her office at 230 for me to pick up handouts from yesterday's class that I missed (GASP!) and then it's back on the short bus to be here by 300 for my accounting class -- some how I see myself walking in late.  *sigh*

<lj-cut text=""Peu un rant en francais"">

J'ai decide ce weekend dernier que je desest la langue francaise et les etudies francaises aussi.  Et pourquoi?  Parce que mon prof de francais a ete herusement mecredi.  Elle a dit a les etudiants, ""Vous etes mal etudiants!  Vous ne preparez pas vos devoirs!  Ce n'est pas juste pour moi ou pour vous!""  Elle a dit les phrase pour 20 minutes!  J'ai crie quand je suis quittee la classe.  J'ai telephone a mon petit ami et j'ai dit ""Francais est tres stupide!  Si j'etait plus intelligent, je peux avoir un diplome different!""  Mecredi etait un mal jour...
en fait, la semaine dernier etait trop mal!  BAH!  Et, j'ai ecrit ce message pour m'averer que je ne suis pas stupide en francais.  BAH!

</lj-cut>

H'okay...so now that I've got that rant out (which is included here for you non-french speaking folks!) I'm going to do an update...

Last week sucked.  Tests on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday; Papers on Tuesday and Wednesday, breathe on Friday.  Cry over the weekend...start the vicious cycle all over again.  It was mid-term week for me last week and it showed.  I was sitting in the drive-thru at Taco Hut with Joseph on Friday night and just burst into tears.  He was freaking out because he didn't understand why I could just start crying.  My response to him was to wait until he started school and then he'd understand.  However, guys seem to deal with the stress much better I think.  Perhaps it's because they're hard-wired differently.  *sigh*

Oh, and my french professor went off on the class saying that we were unprepared students and didn't concept how to learn french well.  Also, that this was our last grammar and conversational class, so we needed to learn it well because after this it was all going to be cultural.  Then she went off on a tangent about not having our homework done and that if we come to class with less than 85% of our homework done, we shouldn't bother coming to class at all.  Now how is that helpful?  There's like technically I think 12 of us registered for the class.  On a good day (other than exam day) I think there'll be maybe 6 of us there.  Geez.  I really hated that class last week, and I'm still leery.  Today went better, and I ended up with an 87/100 on my exam.  YAY for that because it included pronouns and I'm horrible with them other than substituting in je/tu/il/nous/vous/ils for the name(s).  That was a one point improvement from last time over all, but I haven't actually sat down and compared the portions to make sure I'm still improving in each part.  I did however, improve on my essay portion.  I got full credit this time.  WoOt!

This weekend was filled with homework, cleaning, football, and appearances.  Friday I went to Liz's Body Shop party. YAY fun!  I bought some nice smelling massage oil and momma bought something else (I think it was a Grapeseed scent body set).  Saturday I watched football, made an appearance at the park for the kids down in Newport because Joseph's mom was there and asked him to come along.  Helped clean his house, came home and watched some tv.  Sunday was church (Joseph decided he's going to be baptized!), homework, family get together with my family, then Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy.

So we're up to today.  I'm in the library comptuer lab wasting time I could be reading my accounting homework, by updating my LJ.  I have a sorority meeting tonight, but it's informal so hopefully it'll be quick!  Work from 1230-630 (BAH because my immediate supervisor on Monday's is not my favorite person and got a new ban on homework because she thinks I'm doing too much of it.  My philosophy is:  It looks better to be reading or studying in the library than 1)sitting there looking bored (really promotes the library eh?) or 2)falling asleep sitting straight up at the desk and not knowing how long you've been asleep or who all saw you sitting there...and did you snore?)  So I'm going to do my circ duties and sit there (wasting my life away) and when she mentions that I look bored I'm going to say ""well, you seem to think that I'm doing too much homework and a new memo came out about it so I'm not working on my homework now, and you've got no projects for me, so yup, I'm bored.""  Well see how that goes.  I'm psuedo trying to beat her at her own game.  What's the worst she can do?  Fire me?  Well I'd gladly take the break from work; I would just have to break into my Paris money to support myself until I could find another part time job.  *sigh*

Things with Joseph are well, so that's a good thing.  Today I was walking with Zach and he thought I had an engagement ring on!  LOL!  I was like, 'no I need a little more time than 2 1/2 months to decide if I'm going to marry someone.  I just wear his class ring on that finger because 1)I am not single 2)It fits that finger 3)It's too heavy to wear on a necklace 4)Now that I have the necklace from him too, I don't like wearing more than on charm on any of my other necklaces.""  He was like ""Oh well that's good that you're not engaged too soon, but I'm glad you guys are happy together.""  He still didn't bother mentioning why he stood me up for lunch.  My guess is he didn't know at the time that I was off the market and thought maybe things would happen as before, but c'est la vie!

Let's see what else?  Not much that I can think of at this time.  Oh, my car got fixed.  Some kind of switch was reading out bad so they replaced it and it was $140 total.  Momma et Papa picked up the tab because ""you're poor college folk, and we know that $140 is more than your bi-weekly paycheck, and your car insurance payment is coming due.""  So YAY to momma et papa for that one!  Oh, and after paying for my sorority balance and my car insurance, I'm officially poor.  I've got like like $100 total other than my Paris money (which is untouchable except in case of an emergency).  That makes me sad because I'll have to pay for sorority again come January, and I won't have much extra money to add to my Paris fund.  *sigh*  I'll never get there.  *sniff*

Anywho, I guess that's all for now; I'm going to go read my accounting for the next 30 minutes before I start my shift.  Oh, today I got to wear a scarf and gloves for the first time this season because it was ridiculously cold this morning when I left for school.  WoOt for season changes -- soon I won't have to take my allergy medicine any more.  YAY YAY YAY YAY!!!!

Much Love to All!

"event","Mornin' Sunshines.  It's 11:51am and I'm a ready for a nap.  If I would have slept through the night over the past week and the weekend, it would have been better.  Hopefully meeting won't go too long tonight and I can call it an early night and get about 10 before the clock goes off.

Moving on.  So my car is dyeing (sp?) some more.  WoOt or not so much!  I pulled out of the parking structure on Thursday and my car slammed down into gear really hard.  I thought maybe the trans was a bit chilled and that's why, so I drove old-lady-slow over to FCS.  It was having problems downshifting when I hit the appropriate speed.  So I decided to nix hanging around on campus to go to the self-defense class because I didn't want my car to die on me.  Headed home all they way down the Southfield FWY service drive so that I would been on not-so-busy roads if my car gave out on me.  It seemed to do fine about 10 minutes into the ride, so I thought maybe it was just cold.  Went home to drop off my stuff and then back out to the gas station.  Same old stuff happening again.  I head back home and talk to papa.  He pops the hood to find that there's absolutely NO transmission fluid in my reservoir.  Great!  He was like 'how come you didn't know?""  I was like ""no idiot light came on so I had no idea that it was out or I would have bought more and added it.""  So I called Joseph to see what he was upto because I wasn't going to have a car.  His grandparents were over for dinner and wanted to meet me again, so I was invited over to dinner.  I borrowed papa's truck and headed out.  Dinner was fun; his mom's parents are from Alabama orginally so they've got that deep south accent.  WoOt!

Friday I drive papa's truck to work again and work was boring, but I got my homework done (excepting 2 problems that I have to do on the computer) and headed home.  Papa told me that my trans was slipping and he'd have to get estimates.  I cried a little.  That's my peanut popper and I really don't have the money to afford repairs if I don't get into my Paris money. *sigh*  Joseph came up for the football game because it was Girly's last home game ever, and she had the mello solo.  Hooah!  People were really rude at the game; standing in front of people who were sitting down during half-time.  The girl next to me looked as if she wanted to smack me (she should've tried; I was in a mood to whoop somebody with a wooden spoon!) and Joseph's words were ""well, I'm glad you're saying something to those people, but I'm glad that I don't know anyone around here.""  So I slightly embarrassed him.  Then the band was coming up into the stands after half-time and I held up traffic on the bleachers to they could get situated because 1)there's about 60 of them that have to all get back in the stands and 2)instruments are expensive and they just bought brand new equipment for the drum line.  This one chick came up and said ""excuse me"" and I told her no because the band was being seated.  She huffed and rolled her eyes.  Whatever.  This other girl came up and said the same thing.  And I said ""No, we're waiting for the band to be seated right now; if you absolutely must get through, go up and around.""  Her response ""well what's so important about the band?""  I was like ""um, there's 60 of them plus brand new equipment; you can either stand here and wait patiently or go up and around.  Either way I'm not listening to your lip so shush!""  Well she started up the stairs muttering and Joseph was about to say something to her (YAY!) but her other friend grabbed her pony tail and jerked her back down the stairs.  HA I win!  I know it may sound bitchy, but those kids work hard for their show and their equipment and they're going to get respect from at least me!  GRRR!

Headed home after half time to wait for momma and papa to go out to eat.  Applebee's was yummy; headed back home and tucked Joseph in.  Saturday we got up and went to the hospital so Joseph could have his blood drawn; ran some errands; had lunch; watched the game; worked on my econ paper.  Bathed and got ready to go out with Andy and Stacy (2 of Joseph's friends) and headed out.  We listened to the game and Wahoo! M won it.  I about screamed in the truck, but refrained myself because I didn't want everyone else to go deaf.  It was way exciting.  We all went out to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner and then to the ""Haunted Attraction"" in the Taylor Community Center.  My words to you:  Don't go if you're expecting something great.  I thought it was okay only because I am exceedingly claustrophobic and the ceiling is open in that one.  Other than that I think I jumped 2 times.  woot. [insert sarcasm here].  Went back to Joe's and crashed.

Spent Sunday finishing up my homework and then I helped Joe's momma make homemade pierogies.  YUM like WOAH!  I was way excited.  Maybe for our next potluck, I'll make pierogies for you guys too.  WoOt!  Had dinner; played XBox with Joseph; took a nap; watched Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, and then left.  I got to take Joseph's truck because my car is still not fixed and he picked me up at my house.  I was way excited (2005 Silverado!) and I get to drive it today and tomorrow.  YAY!  Hopefully I'll find so nice trucks to race (last time I beat a Ford F150 4x4!)

So for Sweetest Day.  First off, I must proclaim that I am convinced that this is solely a Hallmark Holiday, and should not be celebrated.  However, because mine and Joseph's 2 month was Thursday, he felt the need to celebrate both.  So of course I felt I should get him something as well.  I knew I couldn't get him a tie because for 1 month I bought him a tie (well actually he paid for but I picked it out).  And I didn't really know what he wanted....he had already bought himself a charm for his necklace so I was kinda stuck.  Being poor college folk and already dishing out $30 for his Christmas present, I haven't got much money.  So, since he had mentioned that he wanted something of mine, other than the picture in his wallet, I decided to give him my ring to wear on his necklace.  So Wednesday I went off to Kohl's to find a replacement ring for myself because I feel naked without a ring on my right hand.  Bought 2 nice ones that were on sale for $6.50 each and had to sneakily wear my ring until Friday night after he went to bed so he wouldn't have any idea.  YAY for me pulling it off.  I made him unwrap it first and he was in shock.  I had always told him that I wouldn't be able to give it up because it had been on my finger for the last 7 years and I would feel weird without it.  HA I win!  So his gift....I figured it was jewelry as I expected.  I got a silver chain that has a heart charm on it.  The heart is split in two by a line down the center and one side has 3 small diamonds on it.  I thought I was going to kill him.  He said he got a nice discount, but discount or not this man spends too much on me.  However, he got a big hug and kiss because I appreciate him and his gift, and the rest of our day was well.  YAY!  :)

Today (Monday) was my french exam - that Meghan missed! - I think other than the pronoun section and my mess up of writing out 31st (it's supposed to be trente-et-unieme and I wrote trente-unieme!) I did okay.  My essay was a bit more detailed than last time and I remembered more of the stuff.  The last oral question though I think I misheard.  It answered in days of the week, but that wasn't something we studied.  Maybe she did it to throw us off?  Who knows.  Rest of today = work at the library 1230-630, and then sorority from 730-?.  Econ paper = done so I'm way excited about that; it's a bunch of crap, but it's done.  Joseph's words of encouragement on that: ""well it sounds really super boring so I'm sure it's great!""  HA HA [insert sarcasm here]

This week is super busy (test today; paper tomorrow; test/essay weds; test thurs) so I'm looking forward to the weekend already.  Off to the potty before work.

"event","Yes sunshines you read that right.  And the ironic part of it is that I've actually not lost any weight.  *sigh*

I've definitely been working on it though.  Consumption is down quite a bit from what it used to be.  I need to reverse it though and start eating a bigger breakfast and letting my meals get small during the day.  I read something somewhere that I don't remember from where, and it said ""At breakfast eat like a king, at lunch, eat like a queen, and at dinner, eat like a pauper.""  Makes sense ya know since you'll be going to bed soon after dinner and not having a chance to work it off.  Plus I eat snacks like fruit and veggies in between each meal. I think currenntly with the exception of dinner, that my meals range from like 200-600 calories.  Not sure about dinner though because I'm never home when it's made so I can count the calories.  Workout has been going good too.  I think.  This weekend, I literally didn't have any time to workout, but I did work out Thursday and Friday last week (when I started).  And then I worked out Monday and Tuesday this week.  I'm really sore today though, so I'm thinking about doing Yoga today.  YAY for abudant stretching.  For my workout, I usually rotate between doing strictly cardio with crunchers (80-120 - variations in sets of 10-15) and then 15 modified pushups or 5-10 ""8 count body builder"" push-ups, and then the next day I do my boot camp DVD which is 30 second intervals of cardio then strength training for 25 minutes with warm up/cool down.

I'm not expecting miracles anytime soon, I know that weight loss is a slow process, but other than work, my boyfriend does nothing and still manages to lose more weight than me.  He's now 10 pounds less than me.  *sigh*.

I also now that it's not necessarily the scale that counts, and I think perhaps maybe I look a little thinner, but I can't fit into my favorite jeans yet, so I've not made enough progress...and of course I'd love to drop a size or two...then I wouldn't be considered plus-size anymore by most department stores.  *sigh*

So I guess that's all...oh and I've increased my water intake...but the water at school tastes yucky, so if I forget my second bottle, I only get like 50 ounces a day.  So that's all for now.  If anyone has any suggestions, let me know.  For now I'm off to kick @$$ on my homework and the sorority reports that I have no idea how to do (since HQ won't write me back yet!!!!!  >: | ) and then decorate my house for fall/halloween because that's fun and homework's not.

Jospeh and I are doing good; it'll be 2 months in week.  YAY!  I'm excited.

Much Love to All!"

"event","Just kidding!  lol.  :D  Am I one to be evil and deeevious?  Well...maybe sometimes but only all in good fun.  ;D

Mornin' Sunshines!  It's 9:51 on a sunny, Tuesday morning.  And for once I am quite ""YAY"" but that's only becuase I got like 9 hours of sleep last night for the first time in a long time.

So my last post included that we received 4 new girls.  YAY for that, one had to delay acceptance though, so we technically only have 3 in this new memeber class.  As one of our alum said, ""Quality over quantity"" and that was our motto this year.  There seemed to be some differences with some people understanding that, but it all worked out good.

School is starting to pick up.  Today I've got my first accounting test (that I'm pretty positive about for now.  I think for once my downfall may actually be the long-answer portion and not multiple choice.  I'm not very good at creating the Income Statments/Balance Sheets without looking at one.  I've not done it enough to know it in my sleep, and I don't really have the time to spend extra on it other than studying and doing the homework.

My french essay is due tomorrow.  I've got it written out by hand, and I just need to translate a few words that I didn't know.  There's no citation in it, but it was pretty much prior knowledge for me because I wrote about the history of American English (as opposed to the history of British English - because yes there is a difference!) and I've taken a ton of history classes.  I think I may need to elaborate on more points, but that's what the final proof reading stage is for.  Speaking of french, I received 86/100 on the first exam...it is now offically my lowest test grade in french, but that's a good starting point.  I know what she's looking for now, and how I have to change my study habits to only improve from here.

YAY to Sarah for letting me borrow a curves book and a weight watchers guide.  I'm currently trying to lose some extra weight that I managed to put back on (because of my lazy job over the summer and not enough time to workout whilst taking ACC 298).  I'm way excited about this and I'm hoping it works out.  I'm sorta doing the Special K diet where you substitute 2 bowls of Special K in for 2 meals to jump start it.  I almost need to shock my body into realizing that I'm going to take the pounds off.  And then after like 3 or 4 weeks of that (so I have time to read each thing and make photo copies of what I need) I'm going to pick up with either the Curves method or Weight Watchers.  Sarah's lost like 50 pounds on it, so I think it could work for me too.  I'm really super determined this time because 1)I want to be thinner and not look so sausage-like and 2)Joseph wants to lose weight and when he starts working out, he'll lose the weight faster than me because he has more testosterone and his job is much more physical than my typical day at school (he loads tons of meat into trucks and delivers them to restaurants where he unloads said meat again -- he has quite nice biceps because of this.  lol. *giggle*)  So that's my goal.  I'd like to drop about 30 pounds, because if I go any lower than that 1)my hips will stick out ridiculously and 2)I won't be able to do the double red donation for the American Red Cross (they take 2 units of red blood cells, but give me back my plasma.)

So with that, I think that's the end of my post....it's 10:02 and I must e-mail out my budget to our new advisors and finish getting ready for school so I can head out in about 40 minutes and NOT be late for Econ for only the 3rd time this semester.

Let me say it's a bit different being on the other side.  But things are going well and I love the girls that have signed up.  Mum's the word on everything else though.

School is getting a bit hectic.  Meghan so graciously reminded me that our first essay is due in French class in one week.  Lindsay reminded me that our Expression Orale is a 15 minute presentation on some aspect of French culture at a date set at our descretion.  So, I'm thinking that I'll chose some economic something or other and translate my paper for Internationl Trade (Econ 348) for my French presentation.  Cheesy I know, but I've got to cut corners in order to stay ahead.

I feel almost as if I have nearly been beat to death.  I constantly act and the simple act of putting my backpack on my shoulders sends pain through my entire back.  I cannont wait for this weekend.  One long, hot bath coming right up; plus I'll actually have time to put lotion on instead of throwing on random clothes and my recruitment shirts and running out the door without having brushed my hair.  Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm sleeping to the last minute and then doing stuff for my girls or the homework that's due that day.  I've looked well-kept for the most part...a few fly aways in the hair department, but with a hat on, no one knows.

Anywho, I guess that's all for now.  I'm not really sure whatelse to update because well, I don't really have a life this week.  I've been at school for like 15 hours the past 3 days...I only come to my actual residence to sleep, bathe, and eat breakfast.  Everything else is done at school, and I actually haven't taken any of my text books out of my car since Monday.  I just bring my backpack in and make sure the next day's lunch/dinner gets inside it.  Hoo-ah.

Well my first day was too terribly bad.  French was decent and I'm so super happy that it's a 1h 15m lecture.   OB is well, I can't really have an opinion of it because we didn't really do anything in it today. I met a girl from Brazil though, she's really nice.  So we'll see how that one goes, and there are these web-modules that we do, and on those days, we don't have to come to class.  Fancy-do-that.

Much Love to All (I'm going back to French homework since it's the only class I have books for!)!!"

"event","Evenin' Sunshines.  Well school hasn't even started yet, but I'm already depressed about it and behind.  How do you ask?  Let me explain that one to you.

Not too long ago, I managed to get to the bookstore before it closed and price/ISBN # all my text books.  Well, I misplaced the paper and just managed to order my books online on Saturday.  Okay not too bad, I'd probably go the first week without my text books.  Well, my ACC 299 teacher just e-mailed us all telling us that we're supposed to have chapter 1 read by Thursday and we'll be doing chapter 17 on Tuesday.  Geez.  Plus I know I'll have double reading for Econ.  *sigh*

In other news....my cousin Nikki (NAVY) just got a cell phone today and she called me! YYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!  So now I'll be able to call her and she can call me back after 1400 or 1500 hours.  WoOt!  I'm so excited because I cried sooooo hard after I left her and then again when I got home and was telling Momma and Joseph about it.  : D

Anywho, I just bit into a Jalapeno that was in the salsa and now my mouth is on fire!  But, I'm feeling slightly better and since reports are as up-to-date as possible without the bank statement, I'm off to get ready for school tomorrow because I don't like being unprepared on day 1.  See most of you tomorrow or Thursday.

Much Love To All!"

Sorry for not updating or actually talking to most of you that much.  Life has been well, going, and it's been going good.

Joseph officially holds the record for dating me the longest.  As of this post we have officially been together for 23 days.  WoOt.  He broke the record on Friday, which was 20 days.  I'll be honest, I didn't think things would go as well as they have been seeing as we completely didn't know each other prior to this.  He says it wasn't like we completely didn't know each other, but I said that talking briefly about sports injuries at the office doesn't count because I talk to most of the patients when the came in.

School starts Wednesday...I'm excited yet not enthralled at all.  It'll be good to get back on a decent schedule, but I'm dreading the homework like woah.  There'll be more for french, I'm ""blessed"" with being able to take yet ANOTHER accounting class (AMEN to Prof. Hull!) and of course Econ (shouldn't be too hard) and OB which I have no idea what that's about.

Haven't been doing much drinking since I've become legal.  I think my total is like 4 drinks since my birthday, and they all weren't even on my birthday.  LOL, I'm such a dork.

Going to see Nikki was good.  I'm proud of her.  Her mother was a bit embarrassing on base, but Nikki and Brian squashed that problem before it got too out of control.  She's got a month before she starts her training.  Momma said if her liberty works out so that we can go visit her, we're going to and Joseph is going to come to.  It'll be good fun.

Oh *gasp* momma let Joseph stay the night last night.  Granted he slept in Sarah's room, but I didn't even think he'd be allowed on the same floor as me considering last time he stayed the night, dad put him on the couch.  But whatever, it's not like we're going to do anything.

Both our families think we should get married down the line....kinda weird considering we've only been together for 23 days, but I'm not going to complain; at least they like him right?  He treats me like a princess so I don't care.

Anywho, I think that's all for now.  Life's been pretty uneventful seeing as I've been doing a big bunch of nothing (excepting my trip to IL) since I'm still not working until Friday.

Happy Labor Day to the laborers out there.  Tee Hee.  ;D

Much Love to All!  :*"

"event","H'okay so...as most of you already know, my cousin Nikki is graduating from NAVY boot camp this coming Friday, September 2.  YAY!!  Here's the BOO part of it though.

About 2 weeks ago, my aunt gave me a pamphlet with hotel information in and around Great Lakes.  So, I narrowed it down to the the most-decent, not-really-expensive ones that offered free transportation to graduation (since I didn't know how we were going to get down there) and returned the pamphlets to her.  Well, she decided that Michelle (Brian's ex) should pick the hotel where we would be staying at and gave the information to Brian.  He called me a few days later and asked my preference.  I was like 'um, I already narrowed it down for her to 2 hotels.'  And he was like 'well this is what she told me to do.'  Haven't heard from Brian since.

Well this past weekend, Nikki's division (or whatever she's called) did the best in the tests and she earned 2 hours of liberty (she had taco bell for dinner AND called me!!!).  She also called her momma and said to stay on Grand Avenue.  Okay, the only hotel Aunt Patti had a listing for on Grand Avenue was for $94 a night, and she didn't want to pay that much, but she's still adament on staying on Grand Avenue.  Assigned to me the task of locating a cheap hotel on Grand Avenue and went home.  I of course, having been sick have not bothered to look anything up.  But seeing as I'm awake now and having nothing better to do at 7:00 in the morning, am going to see if I can find a hotel on Grand Avenue for her.  I'm also going to be looking for a back-up plan, because we're scheduled to leave town tomorrow, and I doubt we'll get a hotel on Grand Avenue on Labor Day weekend, 1 day in advance.

I hate procrastination with every fiber of my being and I'll never plan another trip with unorganized people in my entire life!

Much Love to All!

EDITED:  So sunshines, I payed about $100 for a one night stay in the Holiday Inn on Grand Avenue in Gurnee, IL because, well it was the cheapest place that I could get a room in less than 48 hours.  I called my aunt to let her know all this so we could end up staying at the same hotel, and what do you know....she called me back saying this:

Hey Blue Eyes, it's Aunt Pat, um, I called that Holiday Inn and they don't have an outdoor pool.  It's supposed to be like 90 so I don't want to be at an indoor pool.  So I don't think we'll be staying there.  Give me a call, I've got to get some stuff together that I'd like help with.  We can cancel your reservation up until 6:00 pm tomorrow night with no penalty.

I was like are you freakin' kidding me?  She's worried about an outdoor pool when there's like 10 hotel rooms left in the area that'll take reservations in less than 48 hours?  WTF!!!!  So I don't know where she'll be staying, but I'm definitely staying in a king sized bed all to my lonesome at the Holiday Inn.  WoOt for me!

Leaving tomorrow around 10:00am or so, that way I can check in real close to 4; workout; shower; dinner and then bed because I have to be at that NAVY base by like 7am for security checks.  Who would have thought?

Ah well, back to packing.  Much Love to All!"

"event","Mornin' Sunshines!  Well I know it's been awhile since I've updated, but between work, homelife, and Joseph, I haven't done much of anything.  However, the newness is wearing off a bit so things should get back to pseudo-normal.  Plus, he realizes that due to recruitment, he basically won't see me for the entire month of September, so he's spending A LOT of time with me now.  Understandable.  So here's my update on life.

Girly went off to band camp with Momma.  Show seems okay -- a henious thunderstorm ruined the field (um, hello? we marched in the mud and rain -- even had people fall during a performance!  j/k ma soeur!  Je t'adore!) so they stood in concert archs outside the dinning hall and played the music.  Can't wait to see the drill with the show though, I think it'll really make it.

Dad decided to play While You Were Out!  It was so exciting.  We ripped up the the carpet on the main floor and mopped it up while momma was gone.  She absolutely loved it.  YAY!  It was good fun.  Next up for me:  Sanding my hallway finally since I got a sander.  Next up for the parental-units: the office.  Bum bum buuuum.  YAY!  I'm so excited.

Friday was my last day of work at Dr. Nazareno's office.  YAY!!  I don't have to work again until September 9 because I only work Monday's and Friday's at the library.  WoOt!!

Leaving Thursday for Great Lakes, Illinois.  Nikki is graduating from NAVY boot camp on the 2nd.  Not exactly sure how that's going to end up because my aunt still hasn't booked a hotel room.  I'm thinking about driving down seperate and coming back late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.  I'm not sure though.  I guess I'll see when Brian and Michelle are going to come home.  I'm proud of Nikki for making it this far...a lot of people didn't expect her to do it, but she did.  Kudos and gold stars to her.

Things with Joseph are going good.  He's met my entire family (as of yesterday since they were all over for my birthday!) and things went really well.  All the younger kids love playing with him, and he loves kids so that's a plus.  My cousin Jerry commented that it must be a sign because all the kids wanted to rough-house with Joseph instead of him.  My cousin Bridgette told me he was a really nice guy and she can't believe it was working out so well with us being set up by his dad.  And the rest of my family said, ""well if he survives this, then he's golden!  He's a keeper, so make sure you don't lose this one.""  As if I lose people! lol j/k!  But Scott actually did break up with me.  Bridgette was also like 'ya know, Jerry and I got engaged after only 4 months of dating.' And I was like 'ya know, I already told him I was finishing school first and you can't make decisions like that based on 15 days.'  And she was like 'well ya never know.'  So at least I know he's good with the family.  I've met most of his friends, so that's a good thing seeing as with Andy his friends were my friends, and with Scott well I think 1 person knew about me.  And he's anxious to meet all of my friends, so when scheduling works out, you all will eventually be meeting him.  I'm thinking he's going to stick around for a while though.  I asked quite a bit of him yesterday and he was not phased by it at all and told me I was silly to think he would break up with me over it.  So we'll see how this one goes.  So far so good though.

I guess that's it for now...I've spent my morning doing things I shouldn't really be doing and not doing the things that need to get done, so I'm outta here.

Much Love to All"

"event","Mornin' Sunshines!  Yes, it's a Monday morning and I'm not at work.  *GASP!* Actually, the doctor isn't in today and neither is the covering doctor, so Jessica and I decided that it would be dumb for both of us to sit there for 9.5 hours.  So she's working right now, and I have to go back at 3.  YAY for a break.  So this morning after I left the office, I drove out to Romulus to pick up a FedEx package they left a note for only to find out that they were going to try and deliver it again.  Geez!  But I still took time for that one, so I'll end up with about 6 hours today.  On the way home, I stopped at Kohl's to pick up another denim jacket for Girly, and it turns out they were buy one, get one free!  WoOt!  So I picked up a black corduory jacket for myself since Girly had a brown one, and I already bought a jean jacket.  YAY!  :D  Then I stopped and got my oil changed....$30!  BAH!  Then I filled up my car for another $20.  Geez life is expensive!  Came home and took a 40 minute nap, now I'm updating LJ, then I'm doing my finances so when I get home from work I can do the sorority's and workout without running out of time.

SO...now for my date.  Here's how that goes.  Last Friday, as in August 5, Joe Sr. came in to the office to see the doctor.  And we chit-chatted a little bit while he was waiting on his appointment.  He told me I looked stressed out (who doesn't when they're working full-time and have a lot of stuff to do?) and I was like, 'yep I need another vacation and I only came back this Monday from my last one.'  He tells me that I should go out with his oldest son sometime.  Sure, okay, whatever.  He goes back for his appointment and about 25 minutes later, him and the doctor come back up front and the doctor is laughing.  Joe goes 'Heather can I ask you something the doctor won't answer?'  Me: 'Sure.'  J: 'Do you have a steady boyfriend?'  Me: [OMG! What is this guy doing?] 'No.'  J: 'Do you mind if I mention you to my oldest son?  I think he needs someone like you in his life.'  Me: [What dad does this?] 'Um, sure if you really want to, go ahead.'  J: 'Great, sorry to probably have embarrassed you, I'll let you be now.  Thanks again, bye!'  So he heads out and the doctor is still laughing and tells me 'Never in all of my practicing have I ever had someone try and set up one of my receptionists with their sons.'  HA HA.

So Monday comes, and I was ""working"" as usual.  Joe Jr.'s chart comes back through that he's going to pick up some stuff from the office.  [OMG I look pretty bad today and this kid is coming in the office, I can't believe his dad actually said something.  He's not been in here for a while!]  So I have to call him to let him know his stuff is ready for pick up; conversation is short and to the point.  He stops in and I had the stuff ready for him and he takes it and says thanks and leaves.  [Breathes slight sigh of relief, but he's not bad looking -- nice blue eyes]  About 20 minutes later, while I'm finishing a heated discussion with a patient, the phone rings and I pick it up without noticing the caller id:

H: 'Good Afternoon, Dr. Nazareno's Office.'
J: 'Hi....Heather?'
H: 'Yes, this is she.'
J: 'Hi, it's Joe, how are you?'
H: 'Good, how are you?'
J: 'Good.  Hey listen, um, I gotta ask you something.  Um, do you want to go see a movie this weekend?'
H: 'Sure.'

Rest of the conversation was setting up the details and Jessica is giggling in the background because she knew who it was calling long before I did.  The rest of the week passed uneventfully.  And then to Saturday.  Of course, I couldn't find a decent outfit so I went out to the store and bought new pants and shoes, because well for lack of better theology, I'm a girl.  Got ready and Joe came and picked me up.  Conversation went well, he has a super nice truck (4WD, 2005 Chevy Silverado) which he was going to let me drive from the get-go (now who does that?  Ya don't even know how I drive).  So we go out to dinner (Fratello's - the Gnocchi (sp?) was excellent, as was Joe's perch....and I don't eat fish!), headed off to the theater.  I had a list of movies I wanted to see, so we picked the closest one to our arrival times, which was Dukes of Hazzard.  If you can understand the southernness of it, then it's a good movie.  Afterwards, we drove out so I could see the house he was thinking about moving into.  Then we came back my way and played pool, where we met up with his brother and his brother's girlfriend.  I beat him, but only because 2 games he scratched on the 8 ball, and another 2 he scratched on the break, and I just flat out won one.  WoOt for me!  Took me home and I got a good night kiss.  He came over Sunday for dinner and to meet my parents and now we're dating.  Who would have thought?  This weekend we're going to see Willy Nelson on Sunday and he wants to buy me something for my birthday after he paid for the whole date (which I'm sure was ridiculously a lot, but he would let me pay for anything!).  He's a really nice guy and I'm happy.  YAY!

Anywho, I guess that's all for now; I need to do my finances so I can hopefully workout before I have to go back to work.

Much Love to All!"

"event","Howdy Sunshines, this crispy critter is home from vacationing up north.

We'll start out with an entire week update because I noticed my last post didn't include any of this past week.

LAST WEEKEND:
Saturday I was sick all day with an upset stomach and a massive headache that I had had for 3 days.  Melissa was having her car wash that day and I didn't go.  My apologies Melissa -- I didn't even here the phone ring.  Sunday Girly and I went to church and then I had a recruitement retreat.  We accomplished a lot and I got some payment plans from my girls.  YAY for that because I hate having to be hard about the money.  Got ahold of some MIA's and found out that we lost one for good, and for recruitement we'll have an interesting amount in the room!

MONDAY:
Woke up and cleaned up the house a little bit.  Girly went to her high brass sectional.  Waited around for what seemed like forever for her to get back, and then headed out to the wavepool.  MUCH FUN!  Didn't get fried because we religiously put sunblock on.  WoOt for us because no one likes being a crispy critter.

TUESDAY:
""Oh Canada! Our [not-so-much] home and native land...""  Girly and I headed off to Devonshire Mall to pick up copies of HP in British English and French.  Turns out that the bilingual country of Canada doesn't sell French editions of HP; I have to order it online...well that's a gift for my birthday!  Went to a store called Green Earth where I picked up an incense holder w/4 different incense scents for $15 CA.  Headed back out to the car only to find it was storming horrendously!  You couldn't see 2 feet outside the door...water was coming down so hard the sewers couldn't keep up and it was backing up into the mall.  Girly and I decided to have lunch.  Just after we sat down to eat, the power went out. Sweet.  The backup generators kicked in...we finished lunch, and headed out to Wyandotte Street to look for a french bookstore that has apparently not ever existed...even though my french teacher has told me about it.  Ah well.  Went back to the bridge, where we were interrogated ruthlessly by the customs officer.  He decided he needed to know what city we lived in, why we went to Canada, what we bought, how much we spent, whether or not we were bringing back tabacco/alcohol, wanted to see proof of citizenship, and our picture ids.  He was glaring at Sarah's and peering into the car.  Then he looked at mine and decided that it wasn't really me.  He didn't believe, that as dark as my picture was that I could be as pale as I am now.  I was like, that picture is 5 years old, and I've since then not been out in the sun nearly as much.  I played tennis in high school as well as marched which kept me outside all summer, and now I hardly go out at all.  Plus, skin cancer runs prominent in my family, so I don't want to agitate it and get it early.  He seemed reluctantly satisified with that answer and let us go.  Geez what a weirdo-o.

WEDNESDAY:
Ran errands for stuff for up north.  Packed the car up, picked up our cousin Lucas, and headed out.  The trip was pretty much uneventful, with us rolling in up there about 930-ish.  However, I did spot a deer on the side of the road poised with her fawn, ready to jump across, and proceeded to do 70 the rest of the way.  I know that wasn't the best thing going, but I don't want to her about it...I wanted out of the car and away from the deer.

THURSDAY:
Lazed about the cabin.  That was pretty much it.  Oh, we went to Wal*Mart because that's the biggest store up there and picked up some stuff for the weekend.

FRIDAY:
Went to the ""Acre of Junk"" at 10 & 66.  Picked up some more inscence and a spiffy holder that'll match my room.  Also picked up a NAVY flag because I told my K-N I would get one to fly for her.  And I got a Rebel flag, because well some causes never die.  LOL!  Actually I'm proud of my southern roots, and I'm showin' it.  Ralph showed up around 4-ish, and Aunt Nancy about and hour later.  Lazed about some more.  Had an awesome fire...my cousin Joseph is adorable and at 7 years old, says the first thing that comes to his mind.  Example:  While talking around the fire, he brought up snake hunting.  And I was like 'well there isn't going to be any snakes in my car or in the camper.  I don't sleep in the same building as snakes.""  His reply:  ""yeah, well I just put in it in my pants so you don't have to see it.""  [insert so much laughter from the peanut gallery, that I started laughing and couldn't finish the conversation].

SATURDAY:
Canoing and kayaking!  WoOt.  Got up and lazed about until time to go.  Headed out to the public access to pick up our canoe and kayaks.  Loaded in and headed down the Muskegon River.  Made it maybe a half mile before my sister flipped out of her kayak, and I in the midst of trying to help her while fighting the current, flipped as well. My goodness was that water cold!  And in trying to get her and I back into our kayaks, we flipped a total of nine times.  My feet at this point were pretty scrapped up because it was a rocky spot.  Made it down the river a little bit more before my cousin Lucas flipped his kayak and then proceeded to flood it...okay helped him out, and then Girly and I flipped again losing 3 flip flops and sending Lucas down the river for our towel, and Girly swimming for the rented boat cushion.  H'okay so we're all back inside with a few minor scrapes and bruises...my toe is bleeding and her toe that has the nerve damage is hurting like woah.  Go down the river some more...Lucas manages to find all of the missing flip flops.  YAY Lucas!!!!  Girly and I managed to flip again while she was dumping the water from her kayak.  Finally make it back to the cabin, exhausted and have to truck up the double hill to the house.  Good thing the kayaks could stay at the waterfront.  Otherwise, I would have just layed in mine.  Dry out, shower and watch King Arthur (excellent movie!).  Dinner's done and my legs are on fire....they are sunburnt beyond belief.  My skin is sweating from the heat that's coming off of my legs.  Put tons of aloe on and slept with a fan blowing on my legs.

SUNDAY:
Ralph was gone by 10.  My legs were still on fire, so I had a milk compress put on.  That helped a little, but now the skin is super taunt and sore, and of course it's still red...just not hot anymore.  Lucas, Joseph, Girly, and myself headed out around 11...and due to 2 stops, a re-route around a traffic backup, and getting caught in traffic we made it home in 4 hours.  Not too shabby.  Had some ice cream with Girly, and now we're waiting on Momma et Papa to get home for some dinner.  Yum.

Anywho, that's all for now. I'm off to rearrange my room because I feel the need to change it.

Much Love to All!

P.S. - I Harth Darth -- It's a wonderful LJ!"

"event","Yes sunshines, this is a BAH post.  That has been what I wanted to say to everyone who walked into the office today.  But here's an update on my life since my last post was strictly HP related.

LIFE IN GENERAL:
Okay, so the doctor's office is not going much better (see today's VENT section for further details), but I'm on vacation next week. WoOt!  Getting to spend some quality time with Girly.  I'm think we might head out on our own for a quick adventure before heading up to meet up with the rest of the family who is leaving on Friday while I still have to work.  Since Girly's my trooper, she decided to stay with me...so we'll do something fun without the rest of them.  HA!  Then it'll be back to work for 3 weeks, and then I'll be done with 1 1/2 weeks before fall semester starts.  YAY!

Having devoted my entire weekend to Harry Potter, I feel as if I need to crack down on time management now until school starts to get most everything I want to be done finished.  I wanted the hallway ready to paint by fall, but the humidity is too high for me to shut the air conditioners off and open the windows so I can strip the molding with the heat gun.  If I tried to do that, I could end up putting my dad in the hospital for lack of breathing because he has severe asthma (sp?)

So I've been trying to work out Mon-Fri because Nikki is at BMT and is working her butt off 6/7 days of the week if not all 7.  But with my life that I can't put on hold, I've only managed 3 a week.  Not very good if I'm shooting to be able to do 10 military style push-ups by September 2.  However, my evening tomorrow after all my running around should be free enough to work out, and I'm hoping to do Yoga and Tai Chi tonight.  I bought a Tai Chi book at the Harry Potter release because they started carrying them again.  I had previously bought the yoga one which I absolutely love...so I wanted to expand my relaxation exercise collection.

Speaking of Nikki.  I've sent her a letter every day the post runs since she left on July 5.  I hope she started receiving them now since I just got her address last Monday.  She hasn't written me anything yet other than the boys are yummy, because we [girls] all know that Navy boys in their uniforms are some nice eye candy.  lol.  Other than that, I keep sending support because I know she's going to need it.  In my opinion, this will have been the hardest thing she's ever done.  Go NIKKI!!!!  :)  (Even cheering for her in the LJ even though she's not going to ever see this!)

Okay, done with random life update for now...

VENT:

So today at work, everybody and their brothers wanted to come in to see the doctor.  It was booked completely full by like 10AM.  Which isn't too bad if the phone isn't still ringing off the hook on both lines, which knocks the credit card machine out of whack, I'm trying to do 5 referrals over the phone for same-day appointments and next-day appointments, there's a guy who's been waiting in the lobby for 45 minutes and he's complaining, and the same woman who can't understand 'No' has called back 7 times.  It was a relief to stand for 30 minutes in McDonald's waiting on lunch.  As evil as this sounds though, I was hoping the phone would ring off the hook so my employer would have to deal with the crap he always leaves to me.  Shame on me for thinking that, but if you saw some of the crap we deal with you'd understand.  I got out of there 15 minutes over, but because I have to take time off without pay tomorrow to go to the dentist, I won't get paid any extra.  Oh and to top that off -- yeah, don't ya just love being a girl?  I don't particular too much when I'm not expecting it!

/VENT

Speaking of doctors, I just realized that I have to go to the dermatologist again tomorrow at 4:30, so that means I won't be able to make a deposit for the sorority.  Speaking of, that's got me frustrated again, but I'll leave it at that because we don't want any type of rush infractions since people take the time to serach your archives when they've not looked at your journal before.  >: |

Anywho, I guess that's all for now, I've got to go print off letters and all that jazz so I can have the sorority hating me for wanting money.  LOL!

Much Love to All!"

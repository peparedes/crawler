originally, i thought about getting a tattoo of a caterpillar climbing up my scar like a tree branch or something similar.

however, i recently had an epiphany.

"event","fast update because not many different things have been going on.

i'm starting to miss my computer so much it makes me want to cry.  yes, i miss my girlfriend too, but... uh... i should probably stop while i'm ahead.  

i just.... <i>really</i> need photoshop in my life right now.  

today is sunday and when i wake up it'll be monday and the next day will be tuesday and that tuesday marks my 4 week anniversary post-surgery.  which means, of course, only 2 more weeks until i can begin the <b>superfun</b> process of relearning how to walk.  

piece of cake.  ahem.  really.

speaking of walking... i can't wait to be able to get out and walk around seattle on my own.  oh, how i long for the day.  last week, i was naughty.  i decided to see how it was to walk around on one crutch instead of two.  bad news:  it was incredibly easy.  like, waaaay easier than before the surgery.  and it didn't hurt very much at all (considering).  now, knowing that i have these super powers, i must harness them and put them away for another <b>two weeks</b>... pretending i know not that they exist.  i just have to keep reminding myself to be patient... because if i fuck up my hip now being a moron, i won't be able to walk in ten years... fifteen years... twenty years.  oh, the patience of kids these days.

speaking of patience, i'm damn tired of being poor.  so my goal of the week is to finish my resume by tomorrow and get it out there.  i've already got 2 pretty good leads.  maybe 3.  (1)  the call center at starbucks (of course) pays like 10-15 bucks starting out.  and i can sit on my butt all day.  (2)  a friend of lacey's does a tutoring thing... like for SAT and after school stuff.  which i've already done before.  granted, i hated it, but that's because it was whiny rich kids.  i think this is more for underpriviledged ones.  i think i can do it.  and it'll give me good flexibility.  something i can do plus interning at the gay gay gay center and having another job.  (3) they're hiring for a membership manager at the <a href=""http://www.seattlequeerfilm.com/"">three dollar bill cinema</a> which puts on the seattle gay and lesbian film festival every year.  i've already talked to the executive director.  and it would be queer work, part time, plus benefits (!), but i'd have to commit to being here in september and october.  which means i'll <i>never</i> make it back to baton rouge.  which, of course, will break my heart and the hearts of many others...

ah, i think i'll just start handing my resume out on the corner of gay street and see what happens...

<lj-cut text=""now, because i don't get the pleasure to grace your presence often, here's some new pictures of me... in seattle... without hair.  damn, i'm one hot cookie.  i don't know how i keep the ladies off..."">

these are all pictures of me, sitting here at the desk.  pre- and post-grooming.  the 'hawk doesn't do well sans gel.  ah, i love it anyway.  (mostly, i was just laughing at the way i blinded myself, repeated, for my friends.)

"event","i'm alive.

hoot and holler.



the surgery only lasted like 2 and a half hours yesterday.  nice surprise.  i woke up without my coochie on fire like last time, even nicer surprise.

i've been in and out of consciousness since then.  they gave me a pain pump yesterday so that i could control my level of pain meds.  but it came attached to this really horrible heart monitor that kept going off every time i moved.  so, i asked them to take it out.  and away went the heart monitor thing, and so did my foley catheter.  which i thought was a good idea at the time.  until i had to keep getting out of the bed to go potty on my own.  first time, it was fun.  second time, still kinda adventurous... now, i still kinda think i'm going to die.  stupid incision.

the incision is through the same scar as before... except only about 3/4ths of it.  sexy..

i'm so full of myself.  most people when they get this surgery (granted, most are in their 60s) only stand up the day after the surgery.  me?  i had to get up and go to the door of the room and then hightail it down the hall.  the physical therapist was so impressed me made a post-lunch date to try it again with my crutches.  be still my beating heart.

so, now i'm well worn out, dying of thirst, and no longer on my own flavor of pain meds.

my ideas are always dumb.




currently looking for a flight to seattle.  on sunday.  a one-way.  no, i'm not crying.  baton rouge can do very nasty things with other nasty things.  

i'll miss her a little bit though.  sigh.  shutup.





(i'm a little happy i'm alive.   not so happy i can't quench this thirst though)






synopsis:  this surgery was waaaay better then the last one.  waaaaaaaay.  hope the after party is better too."

They had to break this door so that they'd have the room to get me out.  whenever the firefighter was pushing it open and breaking it, i was like ""no!  you can't do that!  this is marisa's truck.  granted, this is after they already cut marisa's front seat out... but, you know, i was in shock.

<IMG SRC=""http://atlas.walagata.com/w/poornonamedslob/wreck/028_28.jpg"">
I'm fairly certain that the stain on that seat is my blood.  The firefighters had to cut this seat out in order to get me out of the back.  that's why it looks all weird.



<IMG SRC=""http://atlas.walagata.com/w/poornonamedslob/wreck/029_29.jpg"">
this is the back seat... where i was.  (they threw all of that debris in after i was taken out)



<IMG SRC=""http://atlas.walagata.com/w/poornonamedslob/wreck/030_30.jpg"">
note how the seat was pushed forward and there's not much space between the seat and the middle console.  that's where i was sitting.  thus, i'm unable to walk for a year...

sigh... 

i'm doing pretty good sticking to my no-wheelchair-in-the-house rule.  i even spent some time today in the recliner and i didn't get that stuck trying to get out.  i was quite proud of myself.  pain or no, i'm a-hopping around.  

i read this story about this guy who had arthritis and got a hip resurfacing surgery that went wrong and then he needed a total hip replacement.  it scared me... a lot.  i don't know how i'm going to get through this.  but i will... because i have to... crap crap crap. 

(i'm trying really hard to find that optimism that i used to have.  it's been a hell of a long 2 and a half months)

i'm really looking forward to physical therapy tomorrow.  it makes me feel like a rock star.  too bad i haven't kept up with any of the exercises at home.  eh, it happens...

he told me on initial accessment, ""there's no easy way to put it, this is going to hurt like hell.""  yeeaaaah...  that was the easy way to put it.  he upped my homework exercises to 5x a day. the first time i did them at home i couldn't even get back in the bed.  the worst is this suzanne somers type of exercise... it's just not <i>right</i>.  whew, i've got a long road ahead of me.

just had leftovers for lunch.  yum.  mom made me dinner a few nights ago... my favorite childhood dish that i haven't had in the 2 years i've been dating a vegetarian.  whoa... what a treat!

speaking of dating...  move over ladies... i'm one single bitch now.  it was bound to happen, and it did.  i'm not really ok, but i'll get there.  i'm a strong kid, and in the end, i enjoy singledom.  you get laid a lot more that way.  (whoooaaa, bad joke).  still, um, yeah.  call me if you want to line up a date.

my little cousin just left.  he was here for 3 weeks and i was starting to get used to him.  before he left he went to the store about bought one of my favorite candies... caramel kisses (thanks janis).  sweet.  x2.  he's a cool kid and i'm going to miss him.

yesterday sucked ass.  in the bad way not the good one.  i broke up with marisa via text message while on the way to new orleans to have a hip aspiration.  smart, really.  we thought i was going to the hospital to have a simple test done, but were freaked out when they lead us to outpatient surgery and made me put on a hospital gown and get on a bed.  for an already emotional rachel, this procedure was NOT the highlight of my week.  i got wheeled into radiology and the chief of radiology came out and introduced himself (and 7 other med students) and proceeded to finally tell me what was about to happen to me:  ""now i've done hundreds of these.  in fact, i've trained most of the radiologists in the state who do this procedure.  so you're in good hands.  what i'm going to do is numb you up with some novacaine and stick this really long needle into your hip.  regardless of the numbing medication, it will hurt like hell, especially when i hit your bone and drag the needle along it to find the joint.  then, i will pump your joint full of saline and draw out the fluids... all while making fun of the grotesque faces you make during this experience.  we will then plate this fluid and see what kind of fun stuff grows.  if it's fuzzy, then you have an infection in your hip.""  so, he proceeds to do this... once.  and comes up blank.  to make sure that it was blank, he wiggled the needle around and around.  confused, he took the needle out and <i>started all over again</i>.  oh, what a joy.  guess what resulted from that endeavor.  go on... guess... right-o!  nothing!!  he pulled out that time and said ""well, for some reason, this was a complete failure.  ::shrug::  sorry.  i'll let dr. dickson know he's got to come up with some other kind of way to find out if you have an infection.""  the end.  

i mean... fuck... can i have no good luck?  can anything go right with me medically?  what the hell...  am i some fucking alien who just doesn't work by ""normal"" human standards.  sbj!!!

so all that pain and traveling (not to mention the $300 co-pay) for nothing.  ""::shrug:: sorry""  fuck you, mr. man.  fuck you.

so now dickson wants me to come back and sedate me so he can open me up again.  i'm not sure what we're going to do.  first, we've got an appointment with another hip doctor in houston to see what he has to say.  maybe it'll be something much better than the crap we've been listening to.

so, that's that.  except also to mention that i got a kick-ass care package from japan.  gentry and elizabeth completely made my month.  it's good to have friends in far-away places.

"event","got back from the doctor...

<big>good news that sorta makes me feel better:  </big>
he agrees that the amount of pain i am in sucks and he upped my pain medication again without making me feel like a wimp or an addict.  also, i wasn't counting right and... surprise... next week is my week no. 8 which means i'll be a-walking... or a-trying to.

<big>bad news that makes me cry a little bit harder:</big>
the hardware in my hip collapsed... because there is <b>no cartilage</b> left.  i don't know what happened to it... it just suddenly disappeared.  i guess it was too injured from the accident AND the surgery.  so, now i'm dealing with being bone on bone... which could be one of the reasons that i'm in such extreme pain.  the other reason he suggested was that i could have an infection in my hip... but i have to wait 2 weeks and if i'm still showing the same symptoms, i have to go back to new orleans and they'll stick me with a really big needle and get some fluid from my hip to test.  

so, what does all of this bone on bone goodness mean for rachel's life?  just this:  that option of ""let's just see how it is and maybe you can live with the pain"" is a pretty moot subject.  the pain will be excruciating and unbearable.  i have to wait at least the next 3 months for my bones to get stronger to decide what kind of surgery i'll subject them to.  i'll have to have either a <a href=""http://www.totaljoints.info/TH_alternative_operations.htm#(3)"">hip fusion</a> or a <a href=""http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/hipreplacement/a/hipreplacement_2.htm"">total hip replacement</a>.  there's major downsides to both so i have a lot of discussing and research ahead of me.  normally, because it's really mostly old folks who have these surgeries, hip replacements win out major.  but, they only last 12-15 years (or much, much less) and i plan on living a really long time.  with a hip fusion, i'll be permanently disabled and, as dr. dickson told me, ""sex will be awkward"" (like it isn't already... with those kind of noises)... but it's permanent and it means i won't have to have several more surgeries over the course of my life...

so i've got a lot of thinking to do... and a lot of crying to do... and a lot of yelling to do and a lot of soul searching to do...   i know i have another major surgery ahead of me... and another recovery.  depending on the surgery, i'll be in recovery again anywhere from a few weeks to three months... i don't know when i'll get back on my feet (literally)

funny story told by the doc:  ""you know, out of the 200 or so injuries that i see like yours, and i'm one of the top doctors in the country to work on them, only about 3 or 4 end up like this.  it's really... yeah...""

but, to make me feel better, i took some pictures... from when i went to wal-mart and was dressed up (only the 2nd time i wore undies) and when my sister got here (yay!)

yesterday was the first day i felt remotely normal.  i got dressed in <i>real</i> clothes (""down with the mumus"") and went with my mom to her work to meet her co-workers and drop off some thank you cards and other stuff.  i'm taking bra, undies, cargo shorts, and dyke-y tshirt.  it's amazing what just that did to my feelings of helplessness.  i decided to try to go on this trip <b>without my walker</b>.  i usually use my walker transfer from my wheelchair to the car.  instead, i just did it all myself.  i'm even getting a lot better at getting in and out of the car.  damn, i felt like he-woman.  of course, when i got home i was completely exhausted, but damn if it wasn't worth it.

for someone who runs away from pain as much as i have in my life.  i mean, man, i never even fucking played sports because i was scared of the ball... this has been a little... too much.  ok ok, a lot too much.  and it's unceasing even if i cheat a little with my pain meds and take them before the clock says my liver can handle it.  

my day runs in 4 hour spurts.  1, 5, 9 or 2, 6, 10 or 3, 7, 11 or, my personal favorite, 4, 8, 12.  if i'm thankful for anything, it's for the nice, round, 12 hour day.  watching the clock helps me keep my sanity.  as strange as that sounds.  

there's this stench that surrounds me.  if you visit, i'll try to scare it away.  but, on an every day basis, it keeps my stomach churning.  yet, it's familiar like an old friend.  nothing disgusts me anymore... 

today's not one of the better days.  it's one that leads me to wish i would have let them talk me into anti-depressants.  because i know they're right in their arguments and mine are just... weak.  weak like the girl everyone says is so strong to be doing this.  as if i had a choice.  as if i stepped up at the right time and said ""hey, take me.  i'll take one for the team this time.""  

I just spent $110 on a medical supplies website.  i'm excited about their choices.  somehow, i've become someone who is more excited buying items from a medical supplies store than amazon.com.  but i really need those gloves.  this wheelchair is giving me blisters and the walker is leaving bruises.  

it's amazing how much one moment can take away.  beyond physical abilities.  it took away things much more precious than that.  much too precious to disclose on a silly online journal.  i'm forever changed to the core.  and i'm trying to get used to this new person.  it's hard, because it wasn't asked for.  and i'm stuck in this place where i've got no where to turn for the comfort of familiarity.

we finally got home at 10.00pm.  mom and i just got into a fight as we pulled into my little ramp area.  so, tensions are already high.  Mom got out to open the door of the house and turn on the porch light and... lo and behold... no electricity.  

Mom had worked out a deal with the girl renting here before that if she left all the utilities on, mom would get them switched into her name ASAP.  Unfortunately, ASAP wasn't really all that soon because of all the trips to the hospital and the cripplesitting.  Turns out Liz didn't pay her bill... so we were left in the dark... on a thursday night.  

we went to a shabby motel for the night and mom got up early (she got me a cripplesitter) and worked to get the utilities in her name.  The electric people said they could get electricity turned on by monday.  Shiit.  we're paying $55 a night to stay at this shithole... so mom called and begged them, and they said ""sorry, we're too busy."" and she got friends to call friends of friends, but it still didn't look like we'd be at home any time soon.  Eventually, someone called the damn Public Commissioner and ranted about how this was an emergency because i'm a cripple and it worked and now i'm at home posting on lj because, yay, the system works sometimes.




I forgot to talk about the perks of aunt rhonda's cableless home.  she has a shower that i could get in.  which meant!!!!!!!  I FINALLY TOOK A SHOWER!!!!!!!!  two actually... they weren't really that refreshing because i couldn't turn on the water before i got in and make it the right temperature.  and her knobs are backwards.  which means i took a nice long cold shower before i took a nice long hot one.  And, i started hurting midway through... but, still... i took a damn shower.  and my mom took it with me.  which was endearing to say the least.

I also finally got my hair did by some 19 year old who had... no joke... finished hair cutting school with SuperCuts the day before.  It's really a chop job that took 2 hours, but it's short so i'm not complaining.  maybe i'll ask jes to clean it up if he comes visit sunday.

"event","we really do have the worst luck you can imagine.  it's just one thing after another.  

in trying to expedite the process of getting admitted to the burn center at baton rouge general, my aunt arranged a doctor's appointment for me monday afternoon.  when we got to baton rouge, we were directed to a family doctor instead of the gynecologist we thought we were destined to see.  Apparently, the gynecologist she promised would get us into the burn center refused to see me because ""it wasn't a gynecological issue."" My aunt was told this at 9.30am.  We left home to go to baton rouge at 11.00am.  she didn't call and tell us that this would be a wasted trip.  Instead, she called her family doctor and he worked us in.  So, we get to this fucker's office, and he eventually sees me.  As soon as he walked into the room, i wanted to punch him.  But, I DO have a lot of pent up aggression.  He wouldn't let us talk.  He interrupted us the entire time and straight up called us liars when we told him how i came upon these wounds.  ""There's no way these came from a pole.  I'm telling you... it's an allergic reaction.""  reeaaaaaallly wanted to punch him.  Then, he talked to my aunt who was in the room... and NOT me or my mother... you know, the people who've been doing this for the last month and THE OWNER OF THE EXPLODED VAGINA!  So, I started tuning him out and just waited for his damn referral because that's really all that i wanted from him anyhow.  Instead of referring us to the burn center at baton rouge general, though, he referred us to the wound care center... for a thursday appointment.  Fine.  Whatever.  I just wanted to leave at that point.  Leave.  Go home.  

But mom's pissed and is like ""Fuck this.  Let's just go to the fucking emergency room at baton rouge general like the doctors at tulane told us to do and get them to refer us to the burn center.  Let's get admitted and get care and get well.""  So, we start driving towards the hospital downtown.  By the way, we were in my Saturn.  See where this is going?   She overheated in downtown traffic... Then she started smoking.  We pulled over into the Albertson's parking lot and my mom had a much deserved breakdown.  I called my brother because he has a penis and is friends with other people with penises so they, of course, would know what to do in such a situation.  They looked around in there, ran the heater (with me in the car because it's really not so easy for me to move around).  We just threw up our hands and settled into the realization that driving back to dequincy wouldn't really be a good idea, so we had to start looking for handicapped accessible places for me to stay until my appointment thursday.  My aunt (same one) had already accessibled her house to take care of my grandma... so... ding ding ding.  a winner for a loser.  No, she didn't have cable either.  

Good thing, though:  Fed up with my car... which is the only vehicle my mom has to bring me around in because my crippleness can't get into her dodge hemi, she bought a new one from my car saleswoman aunt.  Finally, some stability:
<center><img src=""http://www.monorailmike.com/archives/images/img_20050226.jpg""/></center>
Look at how hott those doors are.  They're high which means <i>easy</i> to get in and out of.  It's really my car... except i can't drive.  But once i can, watch out, man.  Then, I have to pay her back when i get my loads of cash.

Fast forward to the appointment at the wound care center.  Once again, more people poke me and prod me.  Final verdict:  the wound is too bad for the wound care center to take care of, so i have a new appointment with the burn care center next thursday.  They <i>could</i> help me, but i'd be awake and it would be painful.  The burn people can put me into surgery and do it while i'm happily sleeping.  Which is a much more comforting idea.  I just wish this weren't taking so long.  because, in the mean time, it hurts like hell.

P.S.  I'll be posting pictures soon.  They WILL be of my vagina.  If just plain vagina grosses you out, don't look at these.  really.  Don't.  

On the happy happy happy front, the pain is getting so much better.   maybe it's the better drugs, but DAMN you have no idea how much better i feel.  i wish i could dance to express myself..."

"event","I just fell for the SECOND time because I'm too damn cocky with my walker.  My arms are weaker than I expected, but thats good because yesterday I got up and walked really smoothly around the house.  I guess I my upper body just hasn't had a chance to get over the shock of that move.  It sure excited the hell out of me, though.  I needed something to get excited about.

I finally have access to the internet... which is also great.   that means i'll be able to have access to my buds.  I'm getting really lonely... and bored.  a lot.  I'm really tired of laying in bed, but i've still got 2 more months to go... at least.  

I've been in DeQuincy now since the 25th.  I had a really hard time adjusting.  I still kinda miss the sterility and comfort of the hospital.  Yes, I know it tried to kill me, but at least I had access to doctors to ask questions and nurses to make sure i took my meds and smooth, safe floors to make walking easy and large doorways and hallways to be able to ride in my wheelchair safely.  But, I'm ruling this house now.  Cause, well, it's adjust or DIE... or something slightly less dramatic.

I've been in an extreme amount of pain since i've been home.  i'm taking waaay too many pain meds and it's still not killing the pain.  It's constant, and my resolve has been long gone.  we called the doctor's office wednesday to ask if this was normal... and to try to get more pain meds because i was close to running out (i took 100 pills in 10 days).  My checkup appointment wasn't until the 16th, but they said ""come tomorrow and we'll try to fit you in.""  I wasn't happy... at all.  Because I already had a GYN appointment in Lake Charles at 10.00 thursday morning and, well, that's a lot of doctors and getting in and out of cars and travelling for a cripple like me.  That's something you have to mentally prepare yourself for, and I wasn't there yet.  So, to make me feel better, mom bought me an ipod.  I guess there is an upside to cripplehood.

So, we went to the gynecologist.  he glanced at my cooch and said ""well, it hasn't improved at all, so this is what i'm going to do.  I'm going to call a plastic surgeon and consult with him about what we should do.  I'll call you later today and let you know""  Apparently plastic surgeons are awesome will dealing with wound care.  I just learned that.  I'm smart.  

Then, we left and made it to my ortho appt at Tulane.  I listened to Lucinda the whole way and was a happy girl.  I guess the bribe worked.  Got there, took xrays, waited for doctors.  Dr. Dickson (head surgeon) and Dr. Richter (one of Dickson's many residents) came in and analyzed the xrays.  He asked me about my pain and i explained how horrible it was.  Then, he turned around and said ""well, this definitely doesn't look right.  there's something wrong.  we're going to admit you to the hospital tonight, get a ct scan, and maybe we'll have surgery tomorrow.""  then he left the room.  I just started laughing in that ""what the fuck else could POSSIBLY go wrong"" kind of way.  I was relieved in this sick way because there was finally a reason that i was in sooo much pain.  Dr. Richter stayed in the room to fill out my admitting papers or whatever and i started talking to him.  I asked what he thought was wrong and he got up and showed me on the xray... there wasn't any space between hip bone and socket... and there's supposed to be space.  there was this weird piece of bone that wasn't supposed to be there, and the hardware wasn't where it was supposed to be.  I asked ""why do you think that is"" and he very honestly said ""you know, in the 4 years that i've been here,  i've never seen anything like that.""  perfect.  

so i got my ct scan and my iv and finally got a room on the fifth floor under Bliss, the head nurse we befriended earlier when we were complaining about the lack of care i was receiving at Tulane.  She knew we were coming so she hooked us up with a private room and made sure everything was perfect when we got there.  The moment I laid down in the hospital bed, aaaah, it was wonderful.  I'll give Tulane that... those beds are much more comfortable than the 50 year old hospital bed i'm currently residing in at home.  

I followed the no eat, no drink after midnight orders just in case there would be surgery... then we woke up friday morning all nervous waiting to hear from a doctor... waiting... waiting... waiting.  finally, at 10.00, the nurse came in and said that dr. richter had called and said that there wouldn't be any surgery today.  mom made the nurses call again to find out if we'd be discharged today.  they said, ""no.  no surgery today, but you aren't gonna get discharged.""  so, she sent away the car that she rented to make this trip so that i'd be more comfortable (it really was nice).  At 1.00, the dr. richter finally made it up to my room to say ""ok, you can go home.""  apparently, the ct scan came back good and while i don't have any cartilage, the hardware is fine so there's nothing to worry about.  F that!  i want a reason for my pain... and i want it to fucking stop!  

He changed my pain meds from loritab (with 500 mg of tylenol) to percocet (with 350 mg of tylenol) so that i don't kill my liver with the amount of meds that i'm taking.  he also gave me some neurotin to help with my throbbing leg and foot that is a result of my sciatic nerve waking up and repairing itself (a good sign, really, but f'n painful).  He took out the staples from my incision... then he left.  That's it.  No, ""hey, i'm sorry i lied to you and i have not explanation for doing that and you don't have a ride back home)

Bliss, because she knows our history, made sure to get a ton of people to look at my cooch while i was there because she was concerned.  (no, it hasn't changed at all)  Oh, I forgot!  Right after we found out about being admitted, my GYN called and told us this:  ""I called my plastic surgeon bud and we agreed that no one in the lake charles area can deal with the wounds on your cooch.  so we're suggesting that you get admitted to the burn center in galvezton, tx.""  Good news.  So, mom knows this, but is just humoring the people who were digging in my vagina while i was at tulane... 3 plastic surgery residents, 1 wound care specialist, 2 nurses, and 1 mother.  And, they had a flashlight... and a polaroid camera.  Somehow, my life has been reduced to this.  They had some suggestions...  but i think we're gonna stick with the GYN and find a burn care center or something like that.  There's a really good burn care center at baton rouge general... so i've heard.  I might get admitted there (which is better than galveston)... or at least have appointments there every week or so for them to get my cooch better.  

I don't know, i've kinda given up on the whole deal.  the pain in my cooch is too much to handle.  they say that for some reason, it's 2nd and 3rd degree burns... which turn into skin ulcers... which, believe me, are no fun to deal with.  i've got 2 rather large ones near my anus... and, they bleed a lot... and ... well, i'm sure you can imagine how much i cry.  

i'm not as strong as i thought i was.  this pain is just too much.  it's actually gotten a lot better since i've been back from Tulane.  maybe it's the pain meds... but mostly it's the staying in bed and not moving.  mom's quit pushing me to get up because sitting up is the most painful thing you can imagine. for some reason, i've been sitting up this whole time and i'm only just now starting to get horribly uncomfortable.

But i'm walking better and moving better... so that's exciting.  like a lot.  instead of getting in my wheelchair to come to the computer... i walked the 15 feet or so.  you know, after i fell. 

sorry for all these long updates, but stuff happens fast, and it happens a lot.  I'm seriously considering posting pictures of my vagina somewhere so that people can see if they want to.  It's so separate from me now.  It's medical and completely non-sexual at this point.  I mean, i've had sooo many people see my cooch... and dig in it.  even my dad and stepdad have seen the pictures, so why be shy.   i don't know.  hrm.  it's just so much easier to understand if you've seen the pictures.  

i hope everyone's doing well.  and that you're thinking of me a lot because i'm lonely out here and that's better than nothing :) 

Christy and Crystal came to visit me all of a sudden.  That was a nice surprise... they just kinda showed up a few weeks ago.  And marisa came down for one weekend and that was amazing because it's nice to have someone that you don't really have to talk to because i can't have conversations that well because i try really hard not to cry around other people.  we just sat and watched tv and she emptied my bedpan and changed my soiled bedpad and that was kinda sweet.  she saw the pain that i go through every day and held my hand when i cried and rubbed my belly when i was trying to mentally make the pain go away.  i'm kinda counting down the days until she can come down again.

speaking of emptying bedpans, it's amazing how being as crippled as i am changes your relationships with people.  I""m so much closer to my family now because my mom has to wipe my butt and listen to me scream and sob because of the ulcers down there.  and my brother empties my bedpan for me when he's here and i never thought that we'd have that kind of relationship.  it took a while for me to feel comfortable enough to ask him too.  he's been so sweet and we've never gotten along this well before.  i hope this carries over.  except for the urine part.  and lacey, when she was here, pulled the skin from my labia and was really gentle and she helped me calm down all the times that i freaked out and i really miss having her here more than anything.  she'll come back in a few weeks... but only for 9 days.  this grown up job shit sucks... a lot.

so, now i'm too uncomfortable to write anything else.  i guess that's kinda the way things will be for a while.
i wish everyone well.  know that i love you.

"event","i woke up anemic. i got a blood transfusion. still in the hospital.

i just finished my blood transfusion.

the plebotomist came before the transfusion to pull my blood for a type and match. it was a latina woman named maria who coughed and sneezed a lot because she had a throat infection. when she was trying to find the first vein, she asked me if i knew that i was about to get new blood. i told her, 'yeah i just found out.' she said, ""just me as a person... i would never get a blood transfusion. even with the changes in the screening process i would never get one... i mean, what if they put a black person's blood in me?"" my jaw dropped. she couldn't find a vein in that arm so she went around the bed to the other arm. as she pricked me for the 3rd time looking for blood, she started telling me how good of a patient i was. she said, ""some black people that come in here, i dont know why they come to the hospital. they're lazy and they just complain about how we stick them too much. i think they just need a place to whine and complain."" she finally found some blood in one vein, but the vein died before she could fill one vial out of the 3 she needed. instead of going to get more supplies so she could poke me again and look for more veins, she proceeded to open the one vial over my bed and casually pour the blood into the other two vials with her sick, contaminated hands.

needless to say, i've complained to everyone higher up that i could, and i've been assured that ""appropriate actions have been taken.""

i might be moving hospitals soon. everyone's scared this one's trying to kill me."

<big>SAN FRANCISCO, California (AP) -- A judge ruled Monday that California's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional, saying the state could no longer justify limiting marriage to a man and a woman.

In the eagerly awaited opinion likely to be appealed to the state's highest court, San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Richard Kramer said that withholding marriage licenses from gays and lesbians is unconstitutional.

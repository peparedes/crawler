Anyway, going back to school was a little more difficult than it should have been. I had registered for all my classes on time and nothing should have gotten in my way, but my dad (unbeknownst to me) had not paid my tuition on time so I was dropped from ALL MY CLASSES!!!!!!!!

Thankfully, I was able to get back into half the classes I was dropped from, and was able to get into similar classes for the others, to fill space. So, whatever...

I guess Kirby broke up with Justin, which, I think, is something she's been thinking about doing for a while now, not because she dislikes him, but it's just ""one of those things.""

Speaking of Kirby, I got her a Christmas gift that I was sure was obscure enough that no one else would get it for her but, of course, she got it from her grandparents, I think. So, I have to come up with something else for her, lest I feel lame."

Had an astronomy test. It went fine, but it's a test, so who cares.

Went home, slept, talked to Terence, went back to the university, ate, got really nervous trying to decide whether or not to ask the girl I dreamt about out, got really ill feeling thinking about it, went to math class, got my last test grade back (which I studied for more than, I think, any other test I've ever taken in my life), got a 53%, talked to her for a while, she found an excuse to ditch me before I could bring myself to ask her, I walked home, watched Invader Zim, tried to talk to Jessica on Facebook's chat, I said ""Hallo,"" she logged off.

"event","An odd night, to say the least. Kirby (who makes a good looking pirate) called me and invited me to go to a part that her friends were chucking. Apparently she wasn't certain she was comfortable with the people that would be there. Anyway, it went well enough, there was food. There was Risk (I lost). And there was ""Lap Tag,"" a disturbing and degrading game in which girls are essentially opening themselves up to be groped by guys. I did not play. Obviously. And then there was truth or dare. I don't think I've ever seen a more boring game played.

Odd night.

In other news, I got a B on my anthropology test, because I'm an idiot, and I failed utterly on my extra credit for math, so I won't be getting any. Flash still sucks up my life.

It's the worst possible way to start a day, a day which I already know is going to be disappointing and frustrating anyhow. I get my math test back today, so I'll get to see how inexplicably badly I did on it, and I have to finish some Flash projects for class and I HATE FLASH!!!!!!!

And you know what sucks most about it? Yep, that's right, it the ""all the time"" part. It doesn't go away. Not for a second.

"event","...So it's been a million years since I posted here, but, well, whatever.

  College has been interesting. For the most part I have nothing negative to say about it. As most of the problems I've encountered have been caused by my own short-comings (namely my tendency to procrastinate). But the classes are on the whole easier than high school, the people are-- Well, the people are exactly the same, actually-- and the atmosphere is just much more relaxed. 

  Still, this is me I'm talking about and nothing is as good as it should be when I'm involved. I have successfully managed to make my own life difficult. Hey, I don't say I have an anxiety disorder for nothin', right?

  Anyway, now this is the awkward part, when Jessica told me she was going out with someone it hit me a lot harder than I thought (hoped) it would. But, no worries, Jessica, I'm not going to make an issue out of it, I'm just saying, I've felt sick of on for the past couple days because of it.

  I kinda miss having a psychologist to talk to about my problems. Otherwise I just don't feel like I have anyone to talk to anymore. I don't want to bother Kirby with my stupid problems, I don't want to talk to my family about them, and I can't think think of anyone else to talk to. Life sucks.

  Oh, and I'll just add this to my post. I tried-- emphasize the <i>tried</i>-- to ask a girl from my math class (and the anime club) out, but this nerd (also from my math class and anime club) kept following us around and I could never ask her. Not that it matters, the more I think about the less I feel she and I should go out. It just doesn't feel right. But I don't really know much about meeting girls, so I feel my options are limited.

  Oh well, whatever, I have to do my homework."

"event","The last few days, though quite interesting, I will try to skim over as quickly as possible.

 First and foremost, as it is the most interesting piece of trivia, I did fairly well at this English Expo thing. I won 3rd place in the Photo Essay contest. That was mostly because a bunch of the morons in the cometition were either incapable of abstract thought or could not read, which would explain why they chose not to follow the directions and were disqualified. Incompitence is a wonderful thing.
 Then, I won 1st place in Short Story Fantasy, which I have to say made me pretty happy. But pride leads to hubris and hubris leads to suffering, so I won't bother feeling too good about it. What I will say is this: violence is awlays an award winning subject matter.
 And, for one brief moment, I shocked myself; I was actually proud of my fetid, pathetic excuse for a school when we ""Paddy whacked"" the other schools from all over the Land of Enchantment. I was extremely proud of Jessica, if it makes sense for a lesser being to be proud of a social better, when she got 1st in Declimation, which she absolutely deserved. But I was also sad that she didn't win anything, that just didn't sit right with me. I just don't think it's right. Otherwise, I'd say everything went pretty damn well.

 Then there was a night of follishness, thievery, and a lil' bit of anger. Lookingback at it now, none of it was a big deal, but it really bothered me. Methinks I need anxiety medication.

 On the bus ride home I didn't sit next to Jessica, at least not all the way. But she had chosen the worst possible of all seats, the one right next to that of an unintelligent, uncultured, piggish, loud girl named Kendra. The though of being in such proximity to her was just too irksome for me to bear. So, I sat in the seat in front of Jessica, hoping that I wasn't being too much of a jerk, for I know I was being at least a little jerk, and put arm through the gap between my chair and the bus' wall and kept my hand on her knee. An odd way of showing affection I suppose, but it was the only one open to me from where I sat and I really wanted to be in contact with her. Finally though, my shoulder, which had been crying to feel her head on it, won the best of me and I forced myself to endure Kendra's existence. It was hard, but I have no doubt it was worth it, for she did just what my aching hand and heart and wanted so much. On the way home she rested her head on my shoulder and that was certainly the best part of the English Expo trip, for me.

Jessica, I'm sorry I'm a jackass. :)"

Slowly, but relentlessly, it has been clawing its way out of the dark regions of my mental vault and into the comparative light of my mental bank, shall we say. I am quite uncomfortable with this thought as it seems to suggest that I may find myself suddenly having a great deal of time to play paintball on Saturdays. And while that may on the surface seem to be a good thing, the reasons for my free time are less than palatable, at least not to me, not now.

That is, until I went with Jessica to a Christmas Church service. It was nice but being there felt very strange and awkward to me. It was like wearing somebody else's jacket (which I was doing incidently); it's nice enough and should be comfortable, but you know it's not yours so you keep hoping that you can take it off soon. After that we went back to Jessica's house, watched A Christmas Story, and she opened the presents I got her, which she seemed to be happy with, so that made me happy. Plus, she looked absolutely beautiful in this dress she had, which is not dissimilar to the one Marilyn Monroe wore in that one picture (you know the one I mean), but with an important exception. This one was black! Which went along quite nicely with the black clothes I had attired myself with. Anyway, it was a good time. :)

I do not truly suffer, but God knows I feel as though I do. I am sick, of the world, of me, of all of this. I want to fade away and let this demented parade march on on its own if it must, with me safely tucked away in oblivion, where I can watch and think and feel free of outside prejudice and force.

I woke up just as late as I do every week-end, but if felt different, because I knew I had not even asked my parents if I could go to Jessica's yet. I asked, expecting to hear a simple ""Yes,"" but I didn't. My mom said I could only go if Jessica could pick me up, since my mom had to bring Terry to a doctor. I informed Jessica. Wandered off, ate steak for breakfast, watched Star Trek.

I begin to think: if I ever become a writer, successful or otherwise, this is what my mornings will be. Do what does not need to be done, then attempt to do what I wish I could do: write stories. I don't have to worry about doing math, or science, or anything else that does not concern me, but I desperately need to find a way to write. What an odd life to live. Obsessed with a method of existence beyong the reach of my poor primate brain. That is the way of life I am doomed for.

I went over to Jessica's in the afternoon. We watched ""A Fish Called Wanda"", and then just talked away the rest of the afternoon. It was pleasant:)

Terry's been annoying lately. He had a straaaange conversion with Jessica last night over messenger. He's going through a rough patch in his relationships, but he's made sure that Jessica and I don't know exactly what the problem is.

My dad is currently in his bed sleeping; nothing can wake him up in the middle of the night. Well, nothing that he can't just shrug off and return to his docile slumber.

"event","This weekend was far, far too short, but at least it was a happy one. I suppose it is better to have short bursts of happiness than none at all.

 Anyway, yesterday was pretty much great. I watched Lost all morning with Terry, went to Bamboo Gardens with Jessica, and went to see The Wicker Man with her afterwords. The movie itself could have easily been a comedy, it had so many scenes with the potential for hilarity that I had to laugh at points in the film. I mean, who doesn't think Nic Cage in a bear suit slugging women is hilarious? It could have achieved greatness! But they wanted to make a horror movie... After I got home from the movies I stayed up till around 2:00 watching the end of Lost: Season 2 with my dad. Seriously, that was a great day.

 Today was really good too, but it did have English homework thrown in the mix, which kind of kept it from being great. Though, on the plus side, my mom thinks my answers for the English homework are pretty funny. Just hope Mrs. Pahh agrees. Anyway, I went and hung out with Jessica again today, which was great, I love being with her, it really makes any day a good day. I went to some kind of Lutheran get-together with her, which was a little uncomfortable for me (I really don't like meeting new people). But I survived and it was ultimately worthwhile. I got food! Then I went back to Jessica's house and watched a little of the original The Omen, which I would like to see the rest of someday.

 After my mom picked me up from Jessica's I went to Hastings and got two new CDs. One is The String Quartet Tribute To Tool: Third Eye Open. It's pretty good. Sometimes it's a hit and miss sort of thing, some Tool songs just don't translate well to violins, violas, and cellos. But others just seem to translate beautifully. The other is Blackwater Park by Opeth. Haven't listened to it yet, but I like some Opeth's other stuff, so I hope this will be good too. Anyway, yeah."

 There was a pep-assembly at which, people have told me since, I looked like I was having a ""wonderful"" time scowling at the cheerleaders, refusing to cheer anyone on, standing impatiently as the Starspangled Banner was sung and watching those around me salute the flag, hands over hearts. It was all incredibly boring, loud, and a few other types of horrible but got even worse when some of the football players came out in drag--Scanty southern drag, to be more specific. Never in my life have I been more happy to have not been wearing my glasses. Had I not been you can be sure that my disgust for humanity would have risen even higher than it already is... Morons.

 The rest of the day went by, mostly without incindent, until school was over. I then fled from the Copy Room, where I am stationed sixth hour, and ran to the Tele-Com lab to grab a couple of cameras and cram them cozily into a carrying case, with the capacity of one. (Forgive the alliteration, but I had to read about it yesterday morning) Then I ran down to the parking lot, put my backpack in the car and gave Terry the stuff he would need to help me film the football game, my duty for Tele-Com.

 Now this was was probably the best part of the day, after school I went to Sonic with Jessica and then back to her house for a while before I had to go to the stadium. It was a nice time, I love being around her, but it was far too short lived. But a little something is, naturally, better than absolutley nothing.

 Jessica was kind enough to drop me of at the football stadium and waited around to make sure I was able to get in with my year-old press pass. Fortunately, I was able to. There were lots of stands dispensing a variety of things, namely JUNK FOOD! For anyone that's been going to my school that is really great news, since the schools have decided that nothing unhealthy wil be allowed on school campus. But, I didn't eat anything and just got onto the field to talk with the Eddy County Media Group (ECMG) guys who were also filming the game. I think I would like to do stuff fo ECMG, they have awesome equipment, (f.y.i. Anything better than a camcorder, which is what Tele-Com supplies us with, is awesome equipment) I think I'm at least slightly compitent with a camera, and I already know most of the people working for ECMG. Also, they're head, named Guy Luttman, seemed like a pretty cool guy. Anyway, I got a little over half an hour worth of footage, more than I needed to since Tele-Com episodes are only supposed to be about five minutes long. So, since I got so much, it doesn't really bother me that Terry did absolutely nothing! He just sat in the crowd and, I think, pretended not to be there.

 After the game I had to hang around Terry and his girlfriend, who was being ubsurdly bouncy last night. We wandered around for about fifteen minutes trying to find someplace to eat, but everyone seemed to be closed, so we returned to the school and Terry and Jamie got ou of the car and left me to listen to Type O Negative in the gloom of the dim car. They made out and goofed around while I watched the contrasting temperatures, within and without the car, slowly send jets of condensation across the windows. The fog turned the nightly world into a gray haze and I saw something, eyes red and evil, watching from one of the back exits from the ""Math Building,"" I watched right back. It was an Exit sign and I very much wanted to somehow exit through it, but that wouldn't really make sense.

 Finally we got home, after dropping Jamie at her house, got something to eat and watched a few episodes of The Office. Then I went to sleep.

Anyway, it was a long day."

"event","It is my nature, and has been since before I can remember, to be rediculously, almost revoltingly, pessimistic and doubtful of my abilities. Everything I create I must destroy before it is finished, everything that is mine I must hate. It is the way of things, it is not likely to change anytime terribly soon. I am rather sick of myself in this light. My constant self-degredation is actually beginning to annoy me, a sign that I am being assimilated into the obtuse conglomerate of mindless drones we so quaintly refer to as society. Am I overexagerating? Of course, I do that constantly, but there is always an element of truth in there somewhere. My mind, quite an odd and original one, if I may say so, is being more increasingly warped by outside forces. It is only recently that I have begun to alter the way I dress, and I have dressed the same way for years and years, and it is mostly due to the fact that I have become such a fan of Type O Negative. Now, rather than dresing in complete and utter black, I occaisionally wear a great deal of green. Furthermore I have been more inclined to actually talk to those around me! This is truly horrific for it means I am now a part of the mechanizations of our collective-conciousness' perpetual motion machine! (As you can tell, I like to word things in the most horrible ways imaginable) I am no longer a malfunction requiring alteration or restoration. I am a thing, a single cell, a single molecule, a single atom playing a simple and unintersting role within the body of a larger, blunter, and blinder entity. I have sunk into my place in social evolution. I was a problem and I seem to have been solved. I am beginning to adapt to society and society has begun to adapt to me. I ma desolving into the oblivion of conformity. I will become the same nothing everyone else must eventually become. So be it, I wasn't doing anything special as something anyway.

I realize this is long and rambling and really not worth reading, but look at it this way, you read it so any annoyance you may have with what I have writen is entirely your fault. Anyway... I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. If I ever did."

"event","Yesterday was pretty damn boring, it rained, it poured, I did the opposite of everything. The only thing of any note was that I went to see World Trade center. It was a pretty good movie, touching, I suppose you would call it. There were some obviously fake New York accents here and there, but over all it was done and acted quite well.

Today was kind of like yesterday, it rained, it poured, I did the opposite of everything. The only thing of any note was that I ate lunch with Jessica! And that was pretty much the best thing that's happened in the past two days. But after that things just went back to a relative norm. It rained, it poured, I did the opposite of everything while I watched Jack Bauer do the opposite of nothing on my borther's TV. What can I say? I live an uneventful life... Hopefully I'll have more to say tomarrow, I get to be educated.


P.S. Oh yeah, I'm feeling kinda sick, but that should pass."

1. Whats the most touching book?: That I've read? Uh... Let's say... Without Remorse, by Tom Clancy.

4. Whats the longest time you've ever been away from home?: One Summer.

"event","Well, having completed customizing my fetid little page to the extant that I can, and making it look absolutely awful, it is now quite late and my mind has been transformed into a lump of putty which might be twisted and mutilated into becoming something truly horrific, the mind of a creative writer. (Note: I use the term ""creative"" very loosely, as I am incapable of writing original, involving, or intelligent stories.) So, I will, instead of attempting to create art which I may or may not appreciate, turn my attention to art which already interests me and which I had absolutely nothing to do with. Now, if you will excuse me, Lovecraft becons to me...

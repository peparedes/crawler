I am not quitting because thats no fitting to leave a friend like you. You make me happy when i am blue and i smile when i see you. Sometimes u are a pain in my side but i kno you are joshing especially when you are dishin washin. Brittany likes squirrels and you like girls and i dont like boys.

1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time.... I know where my watch is pal, where the hell is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is? 



2. People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room for the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and change the channel manually. 



3. When people say ""Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too"".  Damn right! What good is cake if you can't eat it? 



4. When people say ""it's always the last place you look"". Of course it is. Why the hell would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they? Gonna Kick their asses! 



5. When people say while watching a film ""did you see that?"". No Loser, I paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the damn floor. 



6. People who ask ""Can I ask you a question?"".... Didn't really give me a choice there, did ya sunshine? 



7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it, couldn't be new. 



8. When people say ""life is short"". What the hell?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever does!! What can you do that's longer? 



9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks ""Has the bus come yet?"". If the bus came would I be standing here, dumbass? 


funny aint it?
tell ur friends ALL about it

but kinda horrible because i soooo hungry the whole time
i think i gave it away by moaning
food every five seconds lol
and some other stuff...
:p

and then me and leadnra were on our way to the mall
and this motercycle guy passes us
and im dancing in the car
and he looks at me and im like um, hi
and he turns back and smiles and says hi 
so me and leandra are now offically for motercylist dudes lol
only the shy ones

and leandra has this lovely solo
for an alanis morissette song
beautiful :p

and dana was in the car with us again and leadnra
is telling me this story about eric and shes like ""we didnt kno it was 4/20""
and dana goes, when's 4/20?
ahahah soooo funny
and then she was looking at the happy bunny thing on leandra's window and
goes 'Oh look! chinese!"" 
the laugh that came out of leandra's mouth was THE loudest thing ive ever heard
it too was hilarious
and all dana had to say was, it LOOKED chinese

and dana refuses to believe some specific thing that will remain nameless
but its true
and she saw it for herself
and she cant take it
...its true

and then we went and saw my friend in the store he works in
and shes like hes hott!
but sadly hes taken, sorry dana
lol so she got mad at me 
for not telling her sooner that i have hott friends
it just never came up lol

and then we left and um...a big truck dude was sooo gay
cant drive
we ALMOST died!...ok maybe not
but we might have

then when we were driving home this guy was behind us and he was totally riding leandra's ass
so me and dana gave him the finger
and leandra was paranoid that he was following us the whole time
it didnt matter if he was
we had a plan: call eric 
ahahhaa, there was more but im afraid im not allowed to divulge that information

and this whole story is out of order but oh well
so many other funny things
like me telling dana i was gonne put salt in her eye and he sayin Noooo even tho she was leaning in towards it
but we shall not go into that
lol

so i got home
no one was there
how sad
and mark called me and we talked for a bit
and then i went to bed

um yeah theeeeee end
for yesterday
today i shall be bored out of my mind
horrah
def missin him

"event","it has been brought to my attention that
there has been some confusion on the importance
of which letter in Abc should be capitalized

fist off, id like to say the it is indeed A followed by a close B
C is too far off to really be capitalized
maybe if C was the beginning letter...
but it isnt
that ends that problem

A is the first letter of the alphabet
when kids sing the song
the first letter is A!
it'll always be the letter they remember if confused!
B is the second 
ive found that the third can be screwed up
as shown in poles...that will not be shown here

also, think of how many important things start 
with A
Africa, Australia, Aisa, Antarctica
not to mention the countries!...even America!
sooo many important things begin with A!
even the Atlantic!
without A, where would the world be?
ill tell u where
it would be without continents and oceans
we wouldnt HAVE a world
Pangea or w/e it was would still exist without A
and who wants to be that close to Iraq?

and isnt abulia a cool word?
i guess it fits brittany more
with its meaning of abnormal lack of ability to act or make decisions
but whos lookin at that?
i sure aint
and look, the glorious word of aint
always fought over
is it a word, or isnt it?

and a good b word is bandicoot
who could get through life without crash?
i couldnt ill tell u now
and busker which means a person who entertains 
by singing or reciting on the street, in pubs, or in subway passages
a.k.a make total fools of yourselves for other ppl's enjoyment
totally describes me and fritter face!


but the whole point is...
A and B cant live without its c
no matter how small it may be
and clepsydra starts with c
...who can live without their own good ole fashion...water clock

and lets not forget clapperclaw
which means to scold or revile...which chris will be doing
as soon as he reads this...


and so, anyone can see that it is indeed

"event","When you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it
out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on
someone you don't know. 

It all started one day when I was sitting at my desk and remembered a phone
call I had forgotten to make.  I found the number and dialed it. A man
answered, saying, ""Hello."" 

I politely said, ""This is Stephen. May I please speak with Robin Carter""?
Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone
could be so rude. 

I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the
last two digits of her phone number. After hanging up with her, I decided to
call the 'wrong' number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I
yelled, ""You're an asshole!"" and hung up. I wrote his number down with the
word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd
call him up and yell, ""You're an asshole!"" It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling
would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, ""Hi, this is John
Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're
interested in the Caller ID program?"" He yelled, ""NO!"" and slammed the phone
down. I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're an
asshole!"" 
  

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some
guy in a black BMW M3 cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently
waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot.
The idiot ignored me and then stuck his middle finger out the window and
waved it around. I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in his car window, so I
wrote down his number. 

A couple of days later, right after calling the first ass hole, (I had his
number on speed dial), I thought I had better call the BMW asshole, too. I
said, ""Is this the man with the black BMW M3 for sale?"" 

""Yes, it is."" 

""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" 

""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street.  It's a very modern white house, and
the car's parked right out in front."" 

""What's your name?"" I asked. 

""My name is Don Burgemeyer,"" he said. 

""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" 

""I'm home every evening after five."" 

""Listen, Don, can I tell you something?"" 

""Yes?"" 

""Don, you're an asshole."" Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed
dial, too. Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 

But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used
to be. So, I came up with an idea. 

I called Asshole #1. ""Hello."" ""You're an asshole!""  (But I didn't hang up.) 

""Are you still there?"" he asked. 

""Yeah,"" I said. 

""Stop calling me,"" he screamed. 

""Make me,"" I said. 

""Who are you?"" he asked. 

""My name is Don Burgemeyer."" 

""Yeah? Where do you live?"" 

""Asshole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a white house, and to make easy
for you, my black BMW M3 is parked in front."" 

He said, ""I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying
your prayers."" 

I said, ""Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole.  Bring your lunch!!"" 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

""Hello?"" he said. 

""Hello, asshole,"" I said. 

""He yelled, ""If I ever find out who you are!"" 

""You'll what?"" I said. 

""I'll kick your ass,"" he exclaimed. 

I answered, ""Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now."" 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 
1802 West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay
lover. 

Then I called Channel 9 News about the gang war going down on West 34th
Street. 

I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th street. There I saw two
assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars, a
police helicopter, and a news crew. 

NOW, I feel better. Anger management really works."

 Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who'll lay under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep. Wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you're in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup. One who's constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you. The one who turns to his friends and says ""thats her.""
thats the only one that is worth it <3


ive found em

and it was finally warm outside
and then it got fucked up by the rain today
asshole rain should die
if i could evaporate it with just a flashlight i would sooo be outside doin just that
...but i cant so fuck u rain!

um and then after school i drove jesiah home and then went to bobby's and sat there and watched him attempt to put his dirt bike back together
and then i saw mommmy :D who is the bestest but she left so i only actually saw her for a few seconds

"event","ok so the band concert was today
but im not gonna go into details about it
too painful
haha

ok so me and jen and brittany were the three witches from hocus pocus
i dont kno how to spell that
fuck it
but ne way
we were walkin down the halls like them
the while hrr hrr hrr hrr thing was the awesomest
i seriously think we need to call oprah
she'll hook us up with a good citcom...sitcom...w/e
yeah its that good 8)

and then we sat there
we're so obnoxious haha
we made fun of everything
and we danced
oh was it sexy
i wanna go back
its the life

so we sat there and made comments about everything and nuthing
yeah
everything...and nothing
cause we sooo can
i dont remember all of what we said but it was funny
so just pretend u were there
and make up ur own stuff
although itll never be as good as ours
8)

and then after the concert
coutrney, eric, leandra, dana and myself all went to BK
and omg!
it was soooo fun
dana went treasure hunting for french fries in her slushy thing!
annnd her hamburger/chicken thing was a birthday cake in disguise
and she didnt notice when i salted her drink
or stuck my finger in her chicken thing
or when i stuck a french fry in her drink
and eric put a french fry down my shirt and i put it in dana's fries and she ate it
sooo stealthy
i kno ur jealous

and eric kept tryin to push me off the seat
that bastard
lol
jk jk
and we nailed leandra a few hundred times
def dont think it was enough but it shall suffice...for now 
heh heh heh 8)

and then we got kicked out
cause they were closing and i guess that means ppl have to leave
dana wasnt even finished yet
she really should eat faster
she acts like theres distractions
pah

so then i went home and thats it
now im here
and now im not!
bye!

ps: i love bradney and jeffiner"

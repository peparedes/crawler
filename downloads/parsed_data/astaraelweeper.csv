"event","I just did my first ever friends cut, which feels a little weird, since that's never really been my thing.  I didn't cut anyone I know from real life, even if they haven't posted in forever (I know some of you are lurkers), or anyone who still updates regularly (that I can see, at least).  Mostly I cut a number of people who I vaguely know from fandom back in the day when I was in SPEW and otherwise active, but whom I haven't talked to in years.  Just... well, call it the electronic part of winter break cleaning.  

If you can see another entry from me today, you're still on my f-list and you should ignore this. If I cut you and you'd like me to reconsider (or you think I made a mistake, very possible), please let me know.

Real life, physical winter break cleaning will commence tomorrow, hopefully.  It needs to get done soon if it's going to happen, since classes start next Tuesday, yikes!"

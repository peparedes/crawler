"event","What a beautiful day, but why does it have to be so freakin cold out.  oh, well.

I haven't written in such a long time, did you all miss me? Daren and i actually aren't together anymore, we haven't been together for about a month, i'd say are relation went to the drain.  i mean i guess it was a good two years, but it just got to the point where everything he did just kinda got on my nerves.

Hung out with jess, and lori yesterday, it was pretty much a new experience for me.  We went to the movies that was pretty boring though because i think we all where about to fall asleep during it, and then we just walked around town, what townies we are. ha.  Then we headed over to wal-mart and saw Aaron of course he had to fling a rubberband at me, and it had to hit me right in the boob.  Then we just came back to my house, and hung out, playing the old school nintendo because we where bored. And then they left me, to go back to there loving homes.

hmm, i really wonder whats going on with me and my so called ""best"" friend, are we actually still friends?  i wish i knew, or wish someone could tell me, maybe its just time to give up on trying, she seems way envolved with her boy toy.  what a cluster fuck.

"event","Well Everything turned out better then i thought it would.  Daren and ashley ended up staying back up here instead of going down to florida.  im very happy about that, cause darens back! lol.  I don't feel the way i did before.  it was worth everything, i can tell you that.  i love this kid to death.

Christmas eve was fun, my cousins came up, there little rascals but they amuse you.  Christmas day was fun, i got everything i pretty much wanted, and more.  Im pissed cause it snowed and we didn't go to joann's which is the one thing we all look foward to.  but oh well shit happens.  New years was pretty exciting.  Me and Daren were playing a video game and when it ended it was 12:03 so we just missed the ball drop.  pretty shitty.

I'd have to say the most exciting thing over break was being with daren the whole time, and seeing my friends over break.  Also, going to see the tree, and going ice skating at rockafella. that was a lot of fun.  especially being able to skate with my boy."

"event","wow.  in about an hour and 50 minutes daren will be flying in ;], fun fun.  I kinda feel used in a way about the whole situation.  Because I payed for him to come up here, but his dad payed for his sisters to come up here.  it might sound wierd. i dunno.  it just makes me feel kinda upset.  i just don't want to see his dad tonight at the airport. i think ill cry or something, because hes a real jerk.  but oh well. will have to see what happens.

4 more days till christmas! i so can't wait. lol. even though i say that all the time.  well im off to help my mom, and uncle put more decorations on his christmas tree.

"event","It's funny now how your parents actually realize how evil your brother was to you when you where little, but when you were little they would never believe you and yell at you for telling on them.  but I think today my mom actually believed how much he really picked on me. its all good now. i look back and laugh at what we used to do, because it was all out of stupidity, and brotherly, sisterly love. ;]

hmmz, tomorrow night is the big day, when i get to see daren, for the first time in only a month, but it feels like forever.  I still love the kid to death, hes all i really talk about besides gem, and my friends and other stuffs.  I can't wait to see him.  Where also going to go to rockafella to see the big christmas tree.  i can't wait to do that!  i love going into the city, especially when you have good walking shoes! lol.  

Well where leaving right now for my uncles house.  im sure ill go online over at his house.  Theres only 5 more days till christmas, i can't wait to see what i got!  <3333333"

man oh man. i didn't get to write yesterday, but im a bit aggravated with what happened.  My friend and my other friend where going out for about 20 days and now he broke her heart because he wasn't ready for a long term relationship, and i think thats so much bullshit because they where just getting close and everything!  She was balling her eyes out, and i didn't know what to do, and i was trying to comfort her. ugh.  Why do boys have to break girls hearts all the time.  i dunno.

My day was pretty good today. just everyone is giving us a lot of work. by friday we will prolly be loaded up with work and will have to do it all over the break which sucks cause teenagers just wanna relax and hang out with there friends.  

girls just wanna have fun....i love you gem!

"event","Booyah.!  I hung out at home for the morning. I helped my parents put up our christmas village and the christmas tree! fun fun.  It was odd not having my brother there to help us do it but hes all out on his own.

Gem came over around 6 and we just hung out.  we got bored so we just went riding around, we actually find outselves going over to wal*mart and we hung out with aaron for most of the time, and came back home, then we got bored again and decided to go visit some of our friends, but then realized we had none!  so we went to wal*mart again and spent an hour there, hanging out with aaron again.  We hung out outside though while he was doing carts, pretty fun.  Aaron came running up to her car and jumped on it scaring the shit out of us and we screamed so loud. lol. Gem and i tried to spit out our gum and kick it like aaron could but with both missed, its was grand, you had to of been there.  gem ran a red light by accident, bad girlie. but its all good, i still love you!  im going to miss ya! 

Well goodnight. <3 and hair grease."

We got out of school early and im just hanging out with lori and theres nothing around the house to do.  just really the computer. lol. my brother came home before, with his five friends which was fun, but it was like a freakin zoo.  lori thought one of his friends was hot, and jess told him that, it was pretty funny.

<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=6>truth about girls - midol is like crack. end of story. - we will never be too old for sleepovers. - we arent ashamed to cry. - we must go to the bathroom in groups or atleast 2's - we have this thing called feelings. dont hurt them. - theres no point in having an ex if you cant be a bitch to him. - we dont wake up looking pretty. it takes time and effort. - sometimes--- is just never quite enough. - we need girls nights OFTEN. - we hold grudges and we never forget the things you say to us that hurt. - it doesnt matter who dumped who or why. whenever we see an ex with another girl, it always bothers us. not because were not over you, but because we know we used to be that girl. - makeup can hide so many things, like puffy eyes from crying to huge scars from a broken heart. -dont try to lie, not matter what we will always find out one way or another.... even if we dont tell you we know - no guy wants to marry a whore. well, no girl wants to marry a whore either. - never ever ask a girl what she weighs; or imply anything about her weight being too much or too little. just don`t do it. - our eyes are located in our heads. not our chest or butt. when youre not looking in our eyes, WE KN0W. -when u compliment the gurl u like to her friends and the friends know she likes u, then thats major bonus points, bcuz they definetly do tell her, but also remember, they tell the bad stuff to - If we say theres nothing wrong, then theres something wrong. </FONT></P>"

Even though we had to get up at 7 in the morning every morning we still had lots of team bonding and memories! ok the first night after training we went out to eat and me and Chloe got chicken even though it was <FONT color=#ff0000>SPICY!</FONT> It was chicken coated in this honey barbaque sauce but it was bad! Anyway later we find out when we get to our rooms that there is a family reunion in the hotel, like a hundred black people in green shirts. OK at first we think nothin of it but then that night me Jamie and Chloe went downstairs to the food room and there were these black guys CHASING US! omg that was sooo scary they were like 17! so we ran and we went around the corner and there was a hallway and they were running down it at us so then we went down the stairs, tumbled down the stairs and once on the second floor we locked ourselves in a<FONT color=#ff9966> vending machine/ice closet</FONT>.

We were like no......... and they wouldnt go away so we left and got a key from the front desk and when we got back they were gone. Then later we went to kats room to get Jamie some food and as the door was shutting a big black guy tried to get in by pushing the door! Thank god Chloe and Kat were there to shut it! Then last night we were sitting there after our party in our room watching laguna beach and we get a phone call, I answer it and it was a black guy! I gave a look 2 roomates and hang up. Then they call back over and over again while we had Mia answer it&nbsp; and talk getto. They were askin us to go outside and stuff so yeah we had like 10 incounters with creepy rapers! Anyhow a few other highlights were when me jamie and Chloe stole all of Kat and Erikas food (they were pissed), Mia asked the front desk 4 coffie, tampons and pillows, and how we looked after a workout! drenched! mine was the worst I mean my hair looked 100% jelled! yucky!

2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes.....

her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead

her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition


This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ? ?????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes


He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door
going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he
heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump


Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick

he opened it.....

it said ..... youre everything to me....i love you with everything i am and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you

sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to

and the first picture they took together

he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture

it looked as if in the picture she was crying

then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead


If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this.
if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen

Post this in the next 200 seconds and you WILL have THE best

Instead, he had her say she loved him, felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so she would live even though it meant he would die"

"event","ok, 
I think I have the hang of this journal thing. Um yeah today at cheerleading I had a good time except 4 the fact that Chloe got mad at me (as usual) about some stunting. Wow cheerleading comes with way too much drama. I dont know what  to do I mean cheerleading is great and all but I dont think stunting or gymnastics is 4 me. I mean come on would I rather just be in a sport where competing isnt fighting and I am not forced into doing anything. I no if Allie reads this which u probably r she is going to judge me and tell me that I should quit if I dont want to do cheerleading but please dont. Well I guess tomarow is a new day and look at the bright side, I get to watch Chloe behind the wheel at drivers training. LOL
    ps. Chloe if u read this I just wanted to say that instead of arguing about every stupid thing like who is better and who has more turns... why cant we just be happy 4 eachother? well hopefully someone will respond.  <3 that means love 4 anyone as stupid as me, Kaitlin"

Then went to go see Longest yard with jenny.and man was it good.but the kicker was that i had to leave like before it was even over becuase my sister jelah will cry if no one is home when she gets off the bus so we frikin left early.so if anyone knows what happened after the 1st half of the game fill me in please! but yeah so we left.and then i was just sitten here so i hopped online.started to make a subprofile but then ashley miller [ =) ] helped me with my live journal.ohh shes the bomb man!!Ash if your reading this thanks a bunch.

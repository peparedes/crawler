So, on Wednsday I mentioned to someone (not sure who) that due to my mixed heritage, I am gifted with a hardy constitution and as a result I hardly ever get sick and am blessed with phenominally good health.

Thursday I got sick.

God loves to play games with me.

On a lighter note, I spent Shabbos with Rebecca.  Friday night we went to a prepaid dinner at an Indian restaurant (all food prepared before shabbos and Kosher) that was jointly hosted by Carlebach and some Jewish renewal group, which of course means that I had no right to be surprised when one of the women pulled out a tamborine while we were singing shalom aleichem.
A few highlights from that evening:
The hot girl sitting next to me was either drunk, high or both and as a result had her blouse halfway open for half the night, much to the delight of the bisexual woman sitting across the table from me.
I learned a new niggun
The Rabbi who gave the drosh actually gave a good drosh even if it was a bit more chasidish than what Im used to.
The woman who gave a drosh actually gave more of a guided meditation.
Said woman also turned out to be marrried to a Rabbi, named Jill (at least I think her name is Jill)
Good times.

Saturday morning we went to Hadar.  I ran into Rochel (the girl who had her adult bat mitzvah last week.  The woman who did the haftarah was fabulous.

1) 'Why am I on your friends' list?
Comment, then post this in your journal and see what people say about you.

2) If you comment...
1. I'll respond with something random I like about you.
2. I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I'll name something we should do together.
4. I'll say something that only makes sense to you and me (or just me).
5. I'll tell you my first/clearest memory of you.
6. I'll leave you a quote that is somehow appropriate to you.
7. I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.
8. If I do this for you, you must post this on your journal so you can do the same for other people.

So I have a serious issue, specifically I have this obssesive desire to record as many events of my life that I can remember which means when I havent posted in a while, I end up with a long post in which I try to write everything I can remember.
Ah well.
So the Shabbos between the play and Pesach, (Tzav I believe) I spent with Rebecca.  It was incredibly enjoyable.  Friday night we went to the Carlebach Shul and Saturday morning we went to her shul, an egalitarian minyan called Hadar.  
Pesach was civil.  I spent the sedarim at my grandmothers place which meant that my brother behaved like a human being.  On the other hand, I still got constant comments of ""when do we eat"" and ""can you skip a bit"" (when I was already leaving out half of maggid).  Over the first days of Pesach I went to daven at Agudas Achim which has changed its name now to Beit Avraham for some odd reason.  For those who are unaware, I worked myself to the bone at Agudas Achim for two and a half years doing absolutly everything for them.  Now its being run by a guy named Rabbi Yagud.  Well, Ive never felt more unwelcome than when I went there.  They made me feel like some sort of intruder.  On the bright side, theyre not doing any better now than they were when I was there (no minyan).  I also finally got my talis back from them (theyve had it for the past three years).
I also told my family over Yom Tov that Im dating a 37 year old woman.  My mother imediatly went into ""control my son's personal life"" mode.  My father found it amusing and advised me to use condoms.
Saturday night I went to a Emily's Toybox concert with Cindy.  The next day we went to her parents place for Easter dinner.  Essentially she just wanted me there for moral support which I can definatly understand.  Her sister has taken a liking to me which scares me.  Her father has also taken a liking to me which scares me more.
Durring chol hamoed we finally got started on the room additions and kitchen in the basement (just in time for me to graduate and move out).
I saw Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino on Thursday night.  It was facinating.
Last Shabbos I spent with Rebecca again.  Friday night we went to a shul around 110th st where Shmuely Boteach gave a drosh.  We ate at a friend of hers that night where aparantly I made a mild fool of myslef.  The next day we went to Hadar.  Saturday night the two of us watched Salah Shabati.
Yesterday was long and hard but I finished it off very well watching The Life and Death of Peter Sellers with Chaim Orent while eating Starbucks Mocha Almond Chocolate Chunck Ice cream and drinking Jack Daniels. 
Today I slept alot.

Oy, have I been busy.  I finally have some time to sit down and write a few things.
So the Saturday night before Purim I went to Queen Esther's Ball on 57th street.  I didnt know anyone who was going but I figured it was a chance to get drunk while dressed as a pirate and I had to take that chance.  There was a contest for best costume and (surprise surprise) I won best costume.  The prize was $100 and a girl.  Well to be more specific, the prize was a $100 American Express gift card and a girl at the party was captivated by my sexy pirate costume and irresistable charm and took me home.  I say girl rather loosley though.  I asked her her age just to make sure she wasnt too young for me and she told me she was 37.  She wasnt lying.
Long story short Im dating a woman 16 years my senior.  Her name is Rebecca, she teaches Hebrew school at JTS and shes a dancer.  I can only guess where this will lead.
Purim was fun.  Purim night I dressed as a pirate and Purim day I was a court Jew.  For the seuda I went to Marc and Yoni's place where we had a Renaisance Faire themed seuda and sang Irish drinking songs.  I also met Linda there.  Shes an interesting girl.
All that week and the next, my time was taken by set building and rehersals.
All the pain was worth it though.  The play was absolutly fabulous.  We got standing ovations every night.  The weekend of the cast shabbaton Cindy came to New York and stayed at my place.  She saw both the Saturday night and the Sunday performance and loved them both (though she was a little frightened of New York at first).  On closing night, Rebecca came to see the play and came to the cast party afterwards.  
A few random events; Isaac bought a copy of Oblivion, I bought a new sword (a bastard sword this time) and my copper and gold wire finally came in.

Hopefully I'll be able to update more often now that the play is over.

So after Monday, things quickly turned better.  
Teusday I went to dinner with a very strange little ghirl named Sarah.  We ate at Mr Broadway and shared a bottle of wine.  More on that later.
Oh and I went to class drunk later that day.
Thursday Sarah and I went to the MET with her friend Tzippy.  There I noticed a painting that I must have walked by a hundred times and never noticed.  It was a Rennaisance painting of Venus and Cupid.  At first glance it looked perfectly normal; Venus was reclining nude and cupid was standing next to her.  Normal right?  Untill I noticed that Cupid was urinating on Venus.
Overall though, the day was fun.
And my mother guilted me into coming home this weekend.
Shabbos was pretty good.  It was Shabbat Accross America so Friday night I ate at the shul.  I met an interesting girl there named Miriam.  She is the daughter of one of the regulars at the shul named Yitzchak, but she goes to school in Michigan so Id never seen her before.  Shes a very quiet and shy girl (though not as shy as her brother) and I spent most of Shabbos with her.
So my brother has a circle of friends who are all deeply into anime.  They are all girls between the ages of fifteen and ninteen and for some reason they have all taken a strange liking to me (no snickers please).  So one of them had a birthday party/sleepover Saturday night and I got invited (I know the temptation is there but dont snicker).  So I spent the night there (snicker and you die).  While I was there I met another friend of hers that I hadnt met before named Cindy.  Surprisingly, she was older than me (23).  The two of us got along very well and we talked all night.  Im very pleased with the fact that she is also a Ren Faire nerd in addition to an anime geek.  I might be making her a corset.
And I had a revalation that night.
Oh, and the past week Ive been scraping paint almost every night.  I have a hole in my hand now.
Today I got a cold.
Ive still been thinking about the incedents surrounding the Saturday night before last, which I still havent elaborated on.  I should do that.
On a completely unrelated note, Ive been having disturbing dreams lately concerning old girlfriends and sex.

Today was...tough shall we say.
Had a bio lab practical today which was no fun.  The whole room stank of preservatives (a stench that turns my stomach).  
Aside from that, after reherslas I spent the evening scraping paint off the stage.  Fifteen years worth of paint.  It a way though it is enlightening.  Its sort of like looking at a history of the theater.  Aside from that, its rather symbolic in as much as this is the first semester that the theater has been without Doc and so we remove all the old remnants of his career and erase his memory.
...
Ok, now Im depressed.  I wasnt depressed before I started writing but now I am.
There is a bottle of burbon at home with my name on it.
And Im not an alcoholic, Im a drunk.  Alcoholics go to meetings.
Dovid Mordachai
PS. Eventually Ill have to get back to an elaboration concerning Saturday night.  I may not make it public though."

Friday night I ate with Rabbi Rapp.  His mother in law was there.  She is certainly a facinating character.
Shabbos I davened mussaf, birchot hachodesh adar.  Isaac sprained his ankle moitse shabbos and I got to carry him back to my apartment so he could spend the night there.  In the morning I took him to the hospital.
Satruday night, I went to a really cool party at Yechiel's place.  Met a girl there and got her number though it probably wont lead to anything (though you never know).  Towards the end of the party four lesbian goth chicks showed up and I may have picked up another client (chainmaille).
More to say concerning that but not here.
Oh, and I bought another toy today.  This time I got a claymore (five foot long sword).
In other news, MORE FUCKING COMMUNIST SONGS!!!!!!  I need some CDs or something.

So Teusday and Wednsday were unproductive to say the least.  I pretty much slept all day bothdays, though I did make it to shiur.
Middle East history class today was fun.  We were discussing the Chrimean War and I recited ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" from memory.
Tonight I went to a karaoke bar for Devora Reichman's birthday party.  It was a little anoying at first because the bar we were origionally going to was crowded and wouldnt allow large groups.  To we went to the Village Ma.  Nice place but expensive as hell.  I didnt get nearly as drunk as I would have liked simply because I couldnt afford the drinks.  Ah well, I did end up singing ""American Pie"" with Rachel F.
Generally a good night.

I bought a new toy on Sunday.  Specifically, I got myself a Katana to hang n my wall next to the scimitar.  My collection is starting to expand.
Sunday night I had dinner with Laura and Alex.  Definatly enjoyable and the first time Ive hung out with the both of them in like forever (I feel a little ashamed that I just used the phrase ""like forever"")
Today happened.
Tonight the most bizzare thing happened when I went to rehersals.  I went into the theater to find the stage flooded.  I mean there was a good two and a half inches of water on the stage.  Apparantly the neighbors pipes burst and our stage got flooded.  It had to be the weirdest thing I had seen in a while.  So we rehearsed upstairs.
Oh, and for some reason Ive been listening to communist songs lately.

Good God almighty, it has been quite a long time since Ive updated this sucker.
Essentially, my grandfather's death caused a disruption in the regular progression of things, and as a result I stopped doing a lot of things.
Well, I think Im just going to give a general splattering of things of importance that have happened since I stopped updating, in rough chronological order.
(Aside: why am I even bothering with this?  I hardly think that anyone including myself will ever be that interested in what I have to write about my everyday experiences.  Then again, Anne Frank said the same thing.)
So at some point over the summer I went to visit Amy in Philidelphia.  I spent shabbos there and walked six miles to go to the nearest shull.  Her landlord is an interesting character to say the least.  Hes a parapelegic and yet he managed to build all sorts of strange things out of metal in his house.  I honestly have no clue how he managed it.  So Amy and I spent some time together and had a few heart to heart talks about various things.
I went back to YU.  I was living in Rubin Hall with Oren.
Unfortunatly, I was on academic probation last semester so I had to take a minimum number of courses and I couldnt join the play (or so I thought, but more on that later). Oh and I finally managed to pass English Comp 2.
I got a girlfriend and lost her (well, kind of).
So one Friday night, I went up to Michael Rand's place to see if he was busy and Tzippy happened to be there.  Also present were Chaim and Yechiel as well as a young lady friend of Tzippy's who was visiting from the lower east side.  Her name was Anjuli Divinsky.  She wasn't Jewish but she was planning on converting (and still is).  Her father was Jewish and her mother was of catholic stock.  At some point durring the evening I got drunk and began to sing love songs.  Aparantly I managed to charm my way into her heart.  That night, we all went out to a comedy club and I got her phone number.  We started dating about a week later.  I found out that I am a good charmer.  I sang love songs to her in foriegn langueges and send her a love letter handwritted with caligraphy, both with very good results.  On the Sunday before Halloween I took her to the Pennsylvania Renaisance Faire.  She enjoyed it immensly and still wants me to take her to another one, possibly in garb.  We had a nice relationship that lasted about three months.  Even the breakup was good.  On a couple of occasions we both sat down and frankly talked about our relationship.  We finally both decided to call it quits and we are still friends.  Overall, it was the best relationship Id ever been in from start to finish.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been if we had had breakup sex.
Sometime before we went to the RenFaire I decided to start making chain maille using smaller rings.  Since then I have also started using stainless steel in addition to galvinized steel.  I am making Marc a new coif anf hauberk to replace his old ""large ringed"" ones.  I also made a coif for Doc, a pair of bracers (which Im looking to sell), a hand flower and belt for Anjuli, and I am in the midst of making a small hauberk for David Elman and a bra, pair of panties, arm band, and choker for Amy.  Also, when Isaac came back from Israel in January, he started making some chainmaille for himself.  So far he has a chain whip and two vangaurds.  He has also made a very creepy glove.
In September (I think it was September) I went to the wedding of David Elman and Leora Ross.  It was a wonderful wedding and Ruby and I served as eidim for the tanaaim and as the shomrim for the yichud room.  
Over Sukkot I got a bamboo mat for my sukka.
In December a few things happened (aside from breaking up with Anjuli).
I went to Yechiel's 21st birthday party which was a blast.  We went to a karaoke bar and we all got drunk.  Gubin and I sang Beer for my Horses together.  Later that night, one of the girls who was there got particularly drunk.  In the end, Chaim, myself and one of her friends had to carry her to a cab so she could get home ok.
I ended up in the play after all.  Three of the actors dropped two weeks before oppening night and one of them dropped a week before.  I was one of the only people they could get to take a part at such short notice.  The Black Box was certainly fun.
The week of the performance was a blast.  Between the varrious performances, my 21st birthday, the cast party, and a few random parties, I got drunk five days in a row.  
New Years I went to a party in Long Beach where I got drunk and Flemming threw up.  For some reason, no mater how drunk I am, I am always the most sober one of any group.  One annoying aspect of the the party though was the fact that I was lied to concerning the cover charge because someone didnt want me there because they were afraid I would cramp their style.  Whatever, I got in for free in the end so hoohah!
In January, Isaac came back from Israel and JB and I went to the airport to pick him up, thought we almost got lost in the process. 
Saw Chronicles of Narnia.  Loved it.
At the turn of the semester, I got off academic probation and movied into IHP with Ruby and Ephraim.
Gubin, Yechiel and Isaac moved in together in the crackhouse.
The first weekend that they were living there, Gubin threw Nili a Birthday party.  Lots of fun, everyone got drunk.  
Doc retired.
Everyone was surprised.  Aparantly he is alot sicker than we thought.  He has cancer.
In February I saw Spamalot with Anjuli.  Lots of fun.
We have a new director now.  Her name is Lyn Snider and she is so nice that compared to Doc she seems almost indecisive.
We all miss Doc
I got the lead in the new play.  I play the part of Willie Clark in Niel Simon's, The Sunshine Boys.
This past Teusday, the Commentator published a smear article on Doc saying he got fired for attacking a student.  LIES!!!! ALL LIES!!! I went on the radio that night to refute the article and the guy who let me on his show steam rolled me and submarined me.  I have the gossip machine in this school.  
I saw Final Destination 3 today.  Hated it.
Well, that pretty much brings things up to date.

Shabbos before last Avidan Milefsky celebrated a shalom Zachor.  All last week my father and I worked, first on replacing the starter for the van (which in the end we couldnt do because the bolts were too tight so we called Will over to do it and he proceeded to loosen the bolts in 15 seconds) when on sealing the floor of the van with rock hard water putty.  Friday the company aactually had its first job.  Addmittadly it was only cleaning gutters, but its a start.  Shabbos was uneventful and Sunday morning my brother and I went out distributing flyers.
Sunday night my grandfather died.  He was 85.
Teusday morning was the funeral and everyone turned out.  Everyone had good things to say, and it was a lovely affair.
My grandmother is taking it very well.  The only time I saw her cry was after I davened for the amud on the first shiva night.  Then again she always has been incredibly strong.  
My mother is taking it the hardest.  I suppose out of the three children she was closest to my grandfather, that and the both of them have always been the cryers of the family.
Im personally not sad about his death.  First of all, I just view death as another stage of life.  Secondly, I only see death as a tragedy if the person who died never got to live a full life.  My grandfather on the other hand lived a full and rich life.  He knew 52 langueges and taught them at various universities.  He broke Japaneese naval codes durring WWII and helped to shorten the length of the war as well as save possibly thousands of lives.  He rose to the top in the Bethlehem Steel industry and managed to come out of it a well to do man even though the company went into the ground.  He had three children who in turn had seven children of their own and he even managed to write a book of poetry in the midst of it all.  He certainly had a long full and wonderful life and there is no reason to be sad at his death.  
I certainly will miss him, but then again I have full faith in the next world and so I see it as only a temporary seperation.  The only thing that is difficult about it is getting used to the fact that hes no longer here.  The world I always knew wasw a world with Bernie in it.  And now that hes gone the world is a very different and darker place.

This past Shabbos was mildly interesting.  I ate at Avidan's place and Rabbi Shwarts was there to give us both a lesson on the finer points of wiskey.  Educational was one way of putting it, though I have never heard so many Yeshivish words being used in the context of such a non Yeshivish topic.  Or is scotch more Yeshivish than I thought.
Shabbos Mincha I layened.   Check off Balak as another parsha I know a fraction of.
Saturday night I took Josh to a graduation party and met a few of his friends.  A couple I had met the previous Saturday.  They are all strange people who are as obsessed with anime as Josh is. 
Sunday we finished outfitting the van (thank God) and Marc came over with Rachel.  I showed them some of my handiwork around the house and gave Marc the maile hood I made for him.  He was very impressed.  
The rest of this week was work and estimates.  We havent even got the fliers out and already weve done two estimates and are signed up to do two more.
Monday we had our logo painted on the side of the van.  Luckily the phone compeny got the business line put in and finalized about five minutes before we got to the printer so we were able to have our bussiness phone number on the side of the van.
BLATANT PLUG: If anyones interested the bussiness is General Repair and Renovations.  We can be reached on weekdays from 9 to 5 at 610-434-3445.
Once the logo was on the van (which only took about three hours) we took it to another printer to have cards made up.  That will take till this Teusday though.  Monday we also managed to set up a bussiness account.  
Teusday we went to Tania's house to do an estimate.  We were going to do it moday but my mother got sick so it had to be postponed. She didnt show up which was disconcerting.  We went back on Wednsay in the middle of a storm and had to cross a couple of rivers that had  never been there before.  In the end it turned out to be a paint job that would require scaffolding to do; aka. a job we couldnt do.  Not a good omen.
Thursday However, we got a call from Lynn Goldstien and did an estimate for her.  This job we will most likely be doing.  It promisses to be difficult.  It will essentially be a complete top to bottom renovation.  Wish me luck.
Thursday night I also drove Josh to the movies.  He is now dating a Goth chick.  That doesnt bother me.  The problem is that shes a shiksa Goth chick.  Why cant that boy ever date Jewish girls.

Shabbos before last I got quite a scare.  After Maariv I saw someone I met back in the NCSY days named Tom.  Turns out his father has been living here in Allentown for more than a year and hes just coming back from a year in Israel.  That wasnt what scared me though.  What scared me was a friend of his who was there.  When I first noticed her I thought to myslef, ""Wow, she looks alot like Nadine"".  Then I asked her her name and she said her name was Nadine.  I nearly had a heart attack.  My first thought was why she didnt recognize me.  My second thought was what is she doing in my town.  Then she said her last name was Goldman and I breathed a sigh of relief.  She did know Nadine though which is a little creepy.  Turns out shes a sophomore in college and is taking summer classes at Muhlenburg.
Last week was utterly unproductive.  The only thing that got done was that we bought a van on Friday.  Addmittadly though it is a fantastic van.
Last Shabbos I got Nadine's number (Goldman, not the other one).  Dont worry, I didnt write on Shabbos.  I memorized it.
This week was spent outfitting the van.  We're almost done and should finish it up on Sunday.  We have shelves in it as well as pegboards and we have soundproofed it so that we can throw a couple of girls in the back and nop one will hear them scream (just kidding).  
Wendsday I started making chain maile for Marc.  Hes  got a Templar costume now and he was going to use cloth that looked like chain maile.  I cant allow that sop Im making the maile.  Teusday I threw together a rig and tried making the maile with aluminum wire.  That didnt work out very well so Wednsday I went out and got steel wire.  Its tougher to work with but holds up better.  Last night I finished the hood, now Im working on the tunic.  I also made a stand today that will make working on the maile a little easier.
Also last night I called up Amy and worked out a deal with her landlord to do some work for him.  Ill see how that turns out.

Good God Almightly!!!  I havent posted in a while.  This means I have a lot of writing to do.  I reaslize most of those who may read this, if anyone reads this, couldnt care less about my day to day activities.  But it helps my obsessive compulsivness, so deal.
I would like to say something concerning the weekend preceeding my last real entry (involving Jen still being with us and the weekend going well).  I had a revelation that Friday.  Similar to one of my father's revelations but not to that extent.
The Thursday after that entry (the 19th of May), I had my Art History final which as expected was a waste of time.  I went home that weekend in my uncle's car and brought back pretty much all of my stuff and in the process managed to miss the Yom Haatzmaut celebration, though I did manage to stal a few hotdogs.
That weekend I played chaufer for Jen and a few of her friends.  It was prom night for her and I helped her out a bit.
That sunday (the 22nd) I went back to NY for my last final, on monday.  The final (Social Psychology) was a breeze and Monday night (at around 3 am so it was really Teusday morning) I drove home with Gubin in his car.  We stopped off at Philidelphia to drop off a few of his friends and pulled into Allentown at about 5 am.  He continued on th Cincinatti and I slept till noon.
That shabbos (28th of May) was spent at home.
Memorial day, I went to Larry Martin's Barbeque.  Larry Martin is an old family friend who had a party at his house on all the special occasions.  It was enjoyable in the sense that it wasnt a usual party.  When I say that Martin is an old family friend I mean that hes old, and most of his friends are over sixty.  Most of his friends are also professors, so I had some interesting conversations.
That Shabbos (June 4th) was spent in Maryland with Isaac.  The interesting thing was that niether he nor any of his family knew I was going to be there for Shabbos till the last minute, so finding a place for me to sleep and eat was a mad dash.  Shabbos over all went well.  Sunday was the luau.  Isaac's sister sara graduated high school and the whole family was there to celebrate with a luau.  I helped cook.
Monday I left Maryland and headed to Philidelphia.  I was going to meet Amy there but at the last minute things changed and I had about six hours of waiting time for the next bus.  at least it was Philidelphia which meant that I did a little sight seeing.  I saw the liberty bell, Independence hall, Franklins toumb, and drank beer in a period tavern.
That night, seeing as how I had nothing else to doI went with some friends to a party where everyone else was drinking and I was the sober guy.  Being the sober guy at a party is fun.  And I had another revelation.  
That Thursday night I went to a gay bar.  When I got to the door, a guy came up to me with some sort of electronic meter.  He informed me I was acdc.  I left after about an hour.  The bar just wasnt my style.  Not because it was a gay bar, but because it was a gay disco/techno bar.  I just dot apreceate that kind of music.
Shabboss (11th of June) was spent at home.
Shavuos came and went.  I was home and managed to get about five daf of Sanhedrin done.  I didnt realize when shavuos was till sunday morning so Rabbi Torczyner had only about five hours warning to arrange meals for me.  I ended up eating with NCSY (a very odd, deja vu kind of experience).  
This past Shabbos was uneventful.
Oh, and all throughout those five weeks, Ive been doing work on and off, mostly electrical.  My father wants to reastart his old contracting company and were trying to get a buisiness line hooked up now.  Also at some point Jen moved out.
This past Sunday I went to the New Jersy Ren Fair with Masrc and companmy.  Although this time the company was a little different than usual.  This company included Elman, Leora, Marc's girlfriedns Rachel, Marcs Bro, and his girlfriend Erica.  Also Marc now has a knights templar costume.  I now no longer feel safe as Shylock.  Ive got to get working on the Sepharadi costume.
Ive had a splitting headace all week, but I feel better now.
Thank God Im done with that.

<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Elf Ranger Bard
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Mielikki</b> is the Neutral Good goddess of the forest and autumn. She is also known as the Lady of the Forest, and is the Patron of Rangers. Her followers are devoted to nature, and believe in the positive and outreaching elements of it. They use light armor, and a variety of weapons suitable for hunting, which they are quite skilled at. Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn head.

The awards ceremony was fabulous.  I won best supporting actor and was inducted into Alpha Psi Omega (good God, Im a frat boy).  Seeing as how this was Doc's 40th year of running YCDS, we had a big ceremony for him in which he got a plaque and was publicly embarrassed.  Although to be fair, we gave him the plaque, one of his coworkers embarassed him.  It was a proffessor who hadbeen here for 43 years (or so).  He showed everyone this incredible picture of Doc from when he first got here.
My final with Doc went very well.  I was the only guy who did a scene with a soundtrack and Doc complimented me on that.  He said I had all the right music in all the right places.
Thursday morning I had my Halacha final.  I dont think I did very well on it.  I can only rely on the mercyof my Rabbi.
I went home on Thursday and took most of my stuff with me (I borrowed Antons car).  Jen is still staying at our place.  The weekend went very well in general.  
Now Im back at YU.  I had my Talmud final this morning.  I think I did better on it than I did on the Halacha, which is odd, because usually its the other way around.
I have nothing to do tilljy final on Thursday.  Someone please help! I need something to do!

Thae last few days have been an interesting blur.  Ive been spending a lot of time with Gubin and the guys.  A couple of times we went to bars.  One night Gubin and I got piss drunk and discussed religion all the way home.  I think that was Wednsday.  Also on Wednsday, Doc was pleased with my model of the theater.  Thursday (I think) we went out for Chinese and saw ""The Interperator"".  That was a good movie as far as I was concerned.  It was a little slow at times and I can see how people of lesser inteligence, lesser apreciation for art, or just people with less patience would get bored by it.  One ass hole actually fell asleep in the middle of the movie and started snoring.
Shabbos was enjoyable and fairly uneventful.  Friday night I stayed up with Isaac, Gubin, and Tex eating stew and discussing things ranging from Blue Collar Comedy to theology.
Sunday we went to the Darfur Rally.  I noticed that about nintey percent of those there and about eighty percent of the speakers were Jewish.  What do you expect, we're the only ones who care about other peoples sufferng.
Gubin and I went out to Chinese again and saw ""Crash"".  That movie was fantastic!!!  There was no typical plotline which made it extremely interesting.  Those kind of movies are the best if they are done properly.  It wasessentially a movie about racism and prejudice.  There were several scenes that had me crying specifically the scenes involving the hispanic family.
Tonight is the YCDS awards ceremony.  Im psyched.

And now, because Im bored.

Pesach was good, all things considered.  
I spent the sedarim with Isaac and got to me his sisters, one of whome I hadnt met before and the other of whom I had only met briefly.  
Chol Hamoed I went home.  I planted a garden; 8 by 10 feet.  That will supply the family with vegtables for a while.  
Also, one of my brothers co-workers, Jen, got kicked out of her house by her mother.  So now shes staying at our place temporarily.  Because of this, my brother's girlfriend has dumped her.  Apparantly, she is insecure and immature.  Its all for the best anyway.  He shouldnt be dating a shiksa.
Second days of Yom Tov I was with Isaac again.  Getting there and back was a trick.  Oddly enough, it is cheaper to take a bus from Maryland to New York and then drive to Pennsylvania that to take a bus directly from Maryland to Pennsylvania.  Faster too (esspecially with the way I drive).
Friday night, we ate at Rabbi Kurtzfeld's place.  His wife is more of a mut than me!!  I thought I was impressive, being an Irish, Cherokee, Chipewa, Jewish, Redneck.  But she has Irish, Cherokee, Blackfoot, African, Chineese and Jewish blood in her.  She has me beat.
After Pesach we had a Chometz party with doughnuts, whiskey and beer while we watched Dick Tracy and Jurassic Park.
Got back to New York late on Monday.
Had a revelation today.

I am half tempted to take all my previous entries, print them up and continue this journal on paper.
Then again that would take effort.
I reestablished comunications with Shani today.  God knows what that will involve.
Isaac went home today.  Tomorrow I will get on the bus to Maryland.
Pesach is almost here, and its not turning out how I had hoped.  Then again I knew that two weeks ago.  Im not so much sad as I am dissapointed.  I guess I just had high hopes.
Im looking more and more like my father every day.  My hands are even begining to smell like his.  On the other hand Im starting to think more and more like my grandfather.
Before I know it, I will become a god hating, Litvaki, intelectual, redneck.

Well, im feeling mildly depressed.
I went to the MET today to anylize a painting for art history class.  So after the anylizing was done, I decided I wanted to get my moneys worth out of the museum.  Unfortunatly, I naturally gravitated toward those paintings that I enjoy especially, which happened to be the paintings that I had planned to see with Soshia.  I practically ran out of the museum.  I ended up with a terrible pit in my stomach that wouldnt go away.
I cought her on AOL today.  I tried IMing her and she signed off the minute I did so.  Ahe wouldnt even respond.  
Unfortunatly, now I dont have the play anymore to help take my mind off of everything.
Fuck it.  I need to get over this.

For the first time ever, I am genually sad that the play is over.  Teahouse of the August Moon was by far the best play I have ever been in.  I have the perfect role, the set was fabulous, the costumes were fantastic, the cast and crew were a joy to work with.  I loved it.  I honestly wouldnt mind putting the show on for another week.
The performances went so well.
Anyone who didnt see it missed the best show in New York as far as Im concerned.
One person in particular of course who should have seen it.  I called her a few nights ago at two in the morning, addmittedly a foolish mistake on my part (I thought she might still be awake), but her resposne was uncalled for.  She threatened to call the police if I ever called her again.  She could not possibly have said anything more irrational and idiotic.
But fuck that.
The show was wonderful.  The cast party was a blast.  The spoof video was funnier than ever this year.  Mink was nice enough to come to the cast party, considering I no longer had a date, and after everything was ove, I got nice and drunk.  Good times.

Dress rehersals are going very well.  This play will be fantastic.
And Soshia wont see it.
She has refused to come to even one performance so that I can at least say goodbye to her in person instead of just being dumped over the phone.
Im not really sad or angry.  Just a little dissapointed and frustrated.  I really could have used a little bit of closure.  Just a few moments with her to say goodbye and tell her Im sorry.  But she aparantly has little regard for my feelings on the matter.  I know that probably sounds selfish but I dont really care at the moment.  Well, if thats the way she wants it, fine.  Ill give her all the space she wants.  If she has regrets, she'll have to call me.
In the meantime, Im single again, and lonely again, and looking for someone again.  If anyone has any suggestions/phone numbers, please comment.

Shabbos was fun.  I spent it at Stern.  I essentially spent most opf my time talking to Tzippy and Jessie about my current situation.  Saturday night they had an improv group called ""Comedy Sportz"".  They were hilarious.  I love improv.
Sunday I did some tech work.  We finally got the emblem painted on the floor and its actally a good thing we waited till the last minute because if we had done it earlier it would be unrecognizable by now.  Sunday I also went down to the Arts Festival to hear Pennina Schram and Ladino music.  I am dissapointed that I was a little late, but in the end I did get to introduce myself to Pennina which certainly pleases me.
As far as the Soshia situation is concerned, I am waiting for a call from her to see if she will at least be willing to come see one performance so that I can say goodbye to her in person.  In the end, I feel that I can be happy no matter what her disision is.  I have learned to accept my fate.  If she says yes, good if not, thats also good.  If she decides to give me a second chance, thats fine, if not, thats also fine.  I think I can be happy with any outcome.
Im happy with life.
In other news, my hands are covered in lacerations.  I hate chicken wire.

Tonights rehersal was fantastic, comparatively speaking.  Our energy was up and we actually ended up doing a good job.
Soshia may or may not be coming to see the play.
I am actually left in an interesting emotional state.  On the one hand rehersals went extraordinarily well, and due to that, I feel fantastic.  On the other hand, Im still dumped, which leaves me depressed.  Now, Im not really sure what I am.

Yesterdays rehersals were hell compunded by the fact that I was already in a shitty mood.
Soshia has left me snd there is nothing I can do about it.  I cant blame her either.  It was all my fault and my fault alone.  I suppose this is an ultimate lesson about controling myself.  Essentially, this is the only way God could get the message through.  There is a minor chance that she may, one day, give me a second chance but its hardly worth hoping for. Theres nothing left for me to really do but move on.  Ill just burry myself in the theatere.

Well, Its been a while. Whats been going on?
Well the weekend before last I went home and spent the weekend doing manual labor.  Nothing new there.
Monday a week ago, we had our second bad rehersal, which is pretty good.  I mean, that weve had only two bad reherslas all semester.
Purim night was fantastic.  I went to a tisch at Reb Reichman's, danced at the chagigah, and got drunk off my ass with Jeremy Gubin at which point we started running lines.
Purim day and Shabbos I spent with Soshia's family and I thought it went pretty well.  I guess I was wrong.
Oh, and Soshia has dumped me because I am an amazing guy who is immature and disrespectful.

I am in such pain.  Youd think Id be used to it considering how much I go through on a day to day basis, but no.  This time the pain comes in the viral bacterial variety and comes complete with headache, sore throat, stuffy nose, and non stop coughing.
So my first meeting with Soshias parents went exeptionally well.  Her sisters and her mother are all in love with me, her younger brother likes me, and her father and older brother are still warming up to me.  I think a sixty six percent success rating isnt all that bad.  That and Ive fallen in love with the whole family, so its a one hundered percent success rating on their part.
Friday my back wwas killing me.  Oh, by the way. her youngest sister is 11.  Ive found another angel of death.
Shabbos morning I was sick as hell.  Sore throat.  Despite this, I was chosen to daven shacharis.  Shabbos was also Rosh Chodesh which meant hallel.  Amazingly enough, despite the sore throat, I still davened very well, addmittedly at half volume, but the voice qualuty was still top notch.
Today I was sick.  Slept all day.
I need drugs.

Sunday, I went to my cousin's (one of the little angles of death) birthday party.  It was hell, but I enjoyed it.  In short, it consisted of about twenty children playing a game of ""Lets knock down the Giant"".
I love kids.
Monday we had our first bad rehersal.  It was amazing because Doc didnt yell all that much, so as far as bad rehersals go, it was pretty good.  This semester is going fantasticly.  Its kind of scary.
Tomorrow is going to be good.  I am going to meet Soshia's parents.  I am soooo looking forward to this.  Oddly enough, I dont feel nervous at all.

I got to Layen this past shabbos.  It was a good refresher considering I havent layened in nearly a year.  They thre it on me at the last minute too which meant I had to reaquaint myself with the trop real quick, which was a very good thing for me.

What a week.
Monday I went to see KT sing.  It was of course impossible to pick out her voice considering she was in a choir, but I think I can safely assume based on past experiences that she was sensational.
Teusday, I went to a comedy club with Mink.  I have certainly found a close friend in her.
Thuirsday night I got drunk.  Shmuel Sokol is making Aliya on Monday, so we all threw a going away party for him.  Jeremy played guitar and sang and Litwin played violin.  Rabbi Reichman came to give a few divrei Torah.  It was certainly amazing.  
Shabbos I was with Sokol at his place in the upper west side.  Shacharis we went to The Jewish Center where Sokol got an aliya before he made aliya (lol) and I got Hagba.  The Jewish Center was an interesting place.  It was very Yekish and almost had a reform feel to it.  The building itself was certainly very oustentatious.
Today we put cheesecloth on the mountain and I did some tile work for my uncle.
And now, I sleep.

There is now a mountain in the middle of the stage.
I built it on Thursday out of chicken wire.
Shabbos I slept.
I am now tourtoring someone for partners in Torah.
Today I saw the Stern play.
It was pretty good.  My biggest objection was that there were no sound cues.  None.  It just faded from scene to scene in complete silence with nothing to cover up the dead space.  As far as acting is concerned, some were good some were bad.  Jo (played by Natalie Adiel) was fantastic.  She was one of the only ones who knew what she was saying and talked to the other actors.  Most of the other actors didnt know what they were saying and talked at the other actors.  Deanna Frazin and Sarah Nemzer were ok in this regard but not as good as Natalie.  The rest had only a marginal clue of what they were saying and talked at the other actors instead of to them.  Over all it was decent.
I hate being a member of the board.  Acting is fun.  Teching is fun.  Being a board member, oy.
Im going to sleep now.

What a week, and its only Wednsday.
Shabbos I slept almost the whole time.  I was only awake for davening and even then, I was nodding off.
Saturday night I went out with Chai, Tikva, and Jessie.  We didnt really do anything though. We essentially spent the whole time talking about what we were going to do.
Monday and Teusday were good rehersal days.
Teusday was turbulent to say the least.  On the bright side, rehersals went very well.  I spent about two hours with Alex.  We had a terrific time and I left her close to tears.  (Happy aniversery btw).  
On the way back to YU from spending time with Alex, I met an interesting girl on the subway named Mink.  I think Ive found a friend.
On the dark side, Ive got two papers due, I have two finals this week, Im $150 over drawn, I have tech work to do, and ive used 700 minutes on my phone and owe my mother two hundred dollars.

I am in such intense pain at the moment.
Today I worked nearly non stop from three in the afternoon till about one in the morning doing tech work for the theater with a two hour break for dinner and a two hour break for poker with Josh.  I had a little help for the first streach of work, but only a little.  I had a decent amount of help for the second streatch of work.  The last streatch, I had no help at all.  I nearly fell into a lapse of self pity, but I refuse to sink to that.  In addition, I have a few new gashes on my hands.
My whole body aches.
On the bright side, I got to daven shacharis this morning.  I davened Halel very very well if I do say so myself.  So I have that to pick up my spirits.
Tonight, I am going to take a very long shower.

I get back from Israel and the whole world falls on my head.
Ive esentially been spending the past week getting used to being in America again.  This semester, I am not only acting in the play, I am also acting as TVP.  This means a double workload.  I can handle it though.
Sunday I made a new friend; Elke Weiss.  Someone from birthright tried to set me up with her.  I met her and I wasnt really interested in her in a romantic sense, but she is a facinating little girl and I do believe we will become close friends. 
On Sunday I also became considerably closer to an old friend and I had a revalation.
This week is going to be a good deal of work as far as cleaning out props rooms is concerned.  In spite of this, I am looking forward to this week.  This will be the first week of rehersals and I do believe that I will enjoy this play thouroughlly.  We are doing ""Tea House od the August Moon"".  It promises to be quite enjoyable.
Off to rehersals I go.

Again, it was an utterly amazing trip.  I also find it amazing that I cried more durring that trip than I ever have before in my entire life.
The trip back home was utterly misrable.  Not only did I not want to leave, and not only was I feeling a spiritual hole being driven into me, but the plane was extremely uncomforatable.  In ten hours, I barely got thirty minutes of sleep.
I miss the land terribly.  I want to go back.
Alex, Leah, Netta, Sasha I love you all and I miss you.

Ive finally finished packing for Israel.  I will be going to Staten Island tomorrow to spend shabbos with Eli Gutterman and after that, its strait to the Holy Land.  This of course means I wont be posting for a while.  This also means that the next time I post, it will be a freakin long one.
Bye Diaspora!

So I spent most of the day shopping for suplies.  You know, the ususal stuff; film, socks, snacks, Dewars, and a rocket launcher, just in case.  
And Ari gave be a call.
We met up by Time Out Pizza and talked a bit.  Caught up on what each of us were up to.  Aparantly, he went to Israel for a year and becasme a farmer and a shepherd.  Since then hes been wandering around the east coast.
He also happens to know TL.  He dropped by Time Out and the two of them chatted.  That was facinating.
Well, packing time.  Im getting more than a little impatient for Sunday to come.

Well today was eventful to say the least.
It rained a little this morning but it cleared up fairly quickly.
The day started off with a trip downtown to get my passport.  My appointment was set for ten o'clock so, of course, they actually got to me sometime around eleven thirty (government efficiency).  So after they took the paperwork, they had to process everything for two hours.
I spent the two hours mostly at J2 Pizza getting some breakfast (Hell, Im a college student, pizza for bereakfast is normal).  It took me about an hour to eat a slice of pizza and a calzone.  I guess when youre trying to kill time, life goes slower.  That and I had a lot on my mind.
At some point I decided to go people watching.  I saw something interesting.  In the subway there was a middle aged black woman crying.  She was crying in a very odd way.  She was trying to hold it in and at the same time her whole body was moving like a fire.  If I didnt know any better, Id have thought she was on drugs.  There was also a goth girl with pigtails staring at her with a disgusted look on her face.  Eventually the goth girl tried to comfort the black woman.  The black woman did alot of talking (something about a higher power) and the goth girl nodded her head alot, but whenever she black woman happened to look away, the same disgusted expression came over the goth girl's face.  The two of them left the subway together (by chance at my stop) and continued talking.  The whole thing was very facinating.
So I got at the passport place to pick up the passport at one (which is when they told me to come).  So naturally, I didnt get it till about three.  It all worked out though.  I did what I usually do in such situations; I talked to strangers.
I spent some time talking to a girl from Cornell names Katherine.  Eventually of course, I asked for her number.  Something odd happened though.  Usually when I ask someone for their number they either give it to me or they dont.  Katherine laughed and asked me for my number instead and said she'd call me.  So I gave it.
After I got my passport I took a nap and then decided to go downtown to watch another movie.
So I went down to see ""Meet the Fockers"".  I got there around seven thirty and the show was at nine fifteen.  So I had another hour and a half to kill.
I went to starbucks and wasted about fifteen minutes.
When I left Starbucks, I got an amazing surprise.  No sooner did I leave the building than I saw Ari Wolfe.  I hadent seen this guy in nearly a year and hadnt really sat down and talked to him in about three years.  It really made my day to see him, and it was such an amazing meeting.  If I had decided to go to a comedy club instead of a movie I wouldnt have seen him.  If I had decided to watch a different movie or if I had left the Starbucks just thirty seconds sooner or later, I wouldnt have seen him.  We will most likely be getting together soemtime tomorrow.
I still had time to kill, so I went to get supplies for my trip to Israel (more on that later).  While there, I found the most amazing trasure and I know just where to put it.  I just hope I can get the necessary paperwork.
Saw ""Meet the Fockers"".  It was lewd, curde, and blasphemous, but it was entertaining.  Worth seeing once, but not worth seeing again.
It might rain.

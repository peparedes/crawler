Think about this... You may not realize it, but it's 100% true. *PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE POST IT'S SO TRUE*

1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.
2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.
3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.
4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.
5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.
6. You mean the world to someone.
7. If not for you, someone may not be living.
8. You are special and unique.
9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you.
10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.
11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.
12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.
13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.
14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.
15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.

add this as a comment to ten of ur friends tonight and at midnight your true love will find you. Something good will happen to you at 2:25 tomorrow. Get ready for the biggest shock of your life. Whoever breaks this chain letter will be cursed with 10 relationship problems for the next ten years"

"event","Body: Daniel and Jasmine are sitting alone in the park one night....

Daniel: I guess we are the left overs in this world

Jasmine: I think so... All of my friends have boyfriends and we are only the 2 persons left in this world without any special person in our lives

Daniel: Yup I don't know what to do

Jasmine: I know! We'll play a game

Daniel: What game?

Jasmine: i'll be your girl friend for 30 days and you will be my boy friend

Daniel: That's a great plan in fact i don't have anything to do for the following weeks...

DAY 1:

They watch their first movie and they both touched in a romantic film

DAY 4:

They went to the beach and had a picnic...Daniel and Jasmine have their quality time together

DAY 12:

Daniel invited Jasmine to a circus and they ride on a Horror House....Jasmine was scared and she touched Daniel's hand but she touched someone else's hand and they both laughed...

DAY 15:

They saw a fortune teller down the road and they asked for their future advice and the fortune teller said: ""My darling, Please don't waste the time of your life... SPend the rest of your time together happily"" Then tears flow out from the teller's eyes

DAY 20:

Jasmine invited Daniel to go to the hill and they saw a meteor...Jasmine mumbled something

DAY 28:

They sat on the bus and because of a bumby road Jasmine gave her first kiss to Daniel by accident

DAY 29:

11:37pm

Jasmine and Daniel sat in the park where they first decided to play this game...

Daniel: I'm tired Jasmine...Do you want any drinks? I'll buy you one.. I'll just go down the road

Jasmine: Apple Juice that's all

Daniel: Wait for me....

20mins later... a stranger approached Jasmine

Stranger: Are you a friend of Daniel?

Jasmine: Why yes? What happened?

Stranger: A reckless drunken driver ran over Daniel and he is critical in the hospital

11:57pm

The doctor went out of the emergency room and he handed out an apple juice and a letter

Doctor: We found this in daniel's pocket

Jasmine reads the letter and it says:

Jasmine, This past few days, i realized you are a really cute girl and i am really falling for you..Your cherish smile your everything when we played this game..... Before this game would end...I wouldlike you to be my girl friend for the rest of my life.... I love you Jasmine....

Jasmine crumples the paper and shouted:

""Daniel ! i don't want you to die... I love you...Remember that night when we saw a meteor, I mumbled something... I mumbled that I wish we would be together forever and never end this game. Please don't leave me Daniel.... I love you! You cannot do this to me!""

Then the clock strikes 12

Daniel's heart stop pumping

THEN IT WAS THE 30TH DAY........

2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes.....

her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead

her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition


This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ? ?????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes


He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door
going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he
heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump


Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick

he opened it.....

it said ..... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am
and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you

sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to

and the first picture they took together

he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture

it looked as if in the picture she was crying

then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead

think of a wish as you scroll all
the way to the bottom. There is
a message there - then make your
wish.



No attachment on this one.



Stories
Im Kevin im 13 and am in 7th grade. lots of girls like me but i cant choose which one i really like. i love doing things with my friends and girls say im really hot.



I'm 13 years old, and I wished
that my dad would come home from
the army, because he'd been having
problems with his heart and right
leg. It was 2:53 p.m when I made
my wish. At 3:07 p.m. (14 minutes
later), the doorbell rang, and
there my Dad was, luggage and all!!



I'm Katie and I'm 20 and I've been
having trouble in my job and on the
verge of quitting. I made a simple
wish that my boss would get a new
job. That was at 1:35 and at 2:55
there was an announcement that he
was promoted and was leaving for
another city. Believe me...this
really works!!!




My name is Ann and I am 45 years
of age. I had always been single
and had been hoping to get into a
nice, loving relationship for many
years. While kind of daydreaming
(and right after receiving this email)
I wished that a quality person would
finally come into my life. That was at
9:10 AM on a Tuesday. At 9:55 AM
a FedEx delivery man came into my
office.He was cute, polite and
could not stop smiling at me. He
started coming back almost everyday
(even without packages) and asked me
out a week later. We married 6
months later and now have been
happily married for 2 years.


Hi my name is Cameron and i am 15 years old. While reading this i wished i had a nice dr.pepper. All of a sudden my cell phone rang. I asked my mom to pick me up a Dr. Pepper and she told me she already had it in the trunk WHEN SHE NEVER BUYS IT . Crazy but it worked!
What a great email it was!!

Just scroll down to the end, but
while you do, think of a wish.
Make your wish when you have completed
scrolling. Whatever age you are, is the
number of minutes it will take for your
wish to come true. ex.you are 25 years
old, it will take 25 minutes for your wish
to come true).
However, if you don't send this to
people in 5 minutes, you will have bad
luck for years!!



Go for it!!!




SCROLL DOWN!!!!

"event","well i just had to comment even if there wasnt 10 comments but oh well..lol 
first a scary story to tell you:
Once there was a girl named Jamie, she was in 6th grade at Seqouia middle school. It was the day before outdoor school. She couldn't wait, she was so excited, she was packing practically everything in her room for the trip.
""Dont forget to pack your hairbrush, toothbrush, tooth paste, and toilet paper!!!"" her mom yelled after her.
""Yeah, whatever mom"" she shot back.
Getting on the bus the next day, the boy she liked asked if she would sit next to him. Of course she said yes and the whole ride there was wonderful. She found out that he had feelings for her too!
Then it was time to get off the bus, sadly for Jamie and her new boyfriend. They kissed eachother today and went on the grand tour of Camp Bloomfield. She was so excited she had gotten her best friends cabbin and everything. Cabbin ..1. She picked a camp name ""butterfly"" and her best friend, Jessica, picked the name ""Moon""
That night the counselor announced that they had to pick a bathroom buddy (at this time the bathrooms were outside) incase they had to go in the middle of the night.
It was now 9:30, lights out.
Jamie had bunked with Jessica because they were bathroom buddies and since they were so close she couldn't get to sleep because Jessica's faint snoring kept her awake.
Then, she dozed off.
All of the sudden, her eyes poped open, it was still deadly silent in the cabbin and dark outside, only the moonlight shining through the window in a stream accross her bead.
She had to go to the bathroom so she jumped off the top bunk to wake up Jessica, only, Jessica wasn't there.
Figuring Jessica had to go to, and didn't want to wake Jamie, she went to the bathroom alone.
When she came back into the cabbin, she noticed Jessica was still gone...
Strange, but Jamie was sure she was fine.
The next time she awoke, it was broad day light and everyone was awake, and the counselor was crying.
She wouldn't tell anyone why and then Timber, the instructor of Camp Bloomfield, came in.
He announced that everyone must evacuate without looking back, in a single file line. If he saw anyone talking or look back he would call their parents and have them sent home immediately.
Wondering what all the fuss was about, they obeyed, walking in a single file line out the front door.
Jamie was just to tempted and waited for an opportunity to look back.
No one was looking, and she WAS at the end of the line so she glanced back and couldn't believe what she had just seen.
There, beyond all the police, investigators, and FBI agents. Beyond all the caution tape and worried faces...was Jessica.
She had a rope tied around her neck, and she was suspended from the tree. She was skinned clean and bloody. The only way Jamie recignized her was by her eyes, which were the only things that WERN'T skinned or completely covered in blood. There was a bloody knife laying on the ground beside Jessica had a note pinned onto her foot. It wasn't opened so she guessed the cops didn't read it yet for evidence of some kind.
She burst into tears at the sight of her slaughtered best friend and when the counselors asked what was wrong she simply replied ""Where is Jessica, I want jessica!""
The counselor stood up and continued walking, now at a faster pace hard for Jamie and her cabbin mates to keep up with.

----------------one week later---------------------------

Jamie turned on the news to see if the weather was going to be warm or not. But instead, she saw a picture of Jessica as the reporter explained the tragic accident to the public on national television. Here is the reporters story:
""Just a week ago, here at Camp Bloomfiled, a young 12 year old child, Jessica Sonders, was murdered here. 'Taken straight out of her bed' Says the cabbin counselor. Her parents are devistated and are now filing a lawsuit against Camp Bloomfield. She was found cut up and hung by a rope on a tree with a disturbing note that read, ""She was good.""
As if this was not devistating enough, a week later, a man was spotted on Sleepy Hollow, a ground on the camp premisis. He was seen with a chunk of what looked like human flesh. ""He was chewing it up savegly"" says Locust AKA kevin, a naturalist here at camp bloomfield.
A devistating story by Alice Haffer, back to you Ted with the weather.""

Jamie flicked off the TV, mortified at what she had just learned of her best friend. 2 weeks later, Jamie was found on her bed, at exactly 3:01 A.M. dead. She was slaughtered just as her best friend was.

*************************************************
Bad things happen...when you go to the bathroom alone.


Repost this within the next 2 minutes in Jessica and Jamie's memory. If you carelessly don't, both of the dead, slaughtered, girls will come to your bed and slaughter you in your sleep. Just like themselves...

yeah freaky..lol

""Goodnight"" he said.

""Daddy"" she called ""Do you love me??""

""What? of course i do.. why would you say that?"" her dad said.

""A lot?"" she asked

""A lot."" he said and kissed her goodnight once again. It wasnt until he was half way out the door when she blurted

""Daddy if you really love me a lot you wont be mad about what im going to tell you..""

""What? What's wrong? Is everything...-"" her dad said worried

""Mommy.."" she said clutching her fathers arm ""Mommy is gone.. the bad man hurt her.""

Her father was tense now. He pushed his daughter away
""Nonsence"" he said ""Your mother is away at grandma's""

""No daddy, shes not. She came home last night early and the bad man came in with the shiny"" she said now heavily breathing, holding back the tears

There was a sudden silence

""Sometimes i see the bad man.. he comes and tells me stories when you're working late and mommy's gone to bed."" she continued ""But last night he was mad..""

""You are sure of this?"" he asked

""Yes, shh.. the bad man comes tonight""

""Stop this! Where is your mother? he cried

She closed her eyes as tears ran down her cheeks. ""Mommy's in the closet""

Her father eyed the closet in disbeleif. He shakily walked over and slowly..slowly.. turned the knob

It was then that the window cracked open just a bit... and the large, bloody fingers creeped through...
""Daddy"" she whispered ""He's back""

Repost this before midnight or you will lose someone you love.

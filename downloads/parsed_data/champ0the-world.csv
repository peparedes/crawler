"event","oh summer is great. i love being able to sleep in as late as i want. its funny too, last summer i would sleep the entire day and get up at like 3 or 4. but i find myself getting up earlier and earlier each day though. i mean, its still like 11 or 12, but still thats quite good if you know me. i guess its me trying to get myself ready for when i am living on my own clock and waking myself up. kind of scary to think about. speaking of clocks, i decided i am going to start collecting clocks. something about their melodic never changing never ceasing ticking facinates me. plus, i just want something to collect. clocks sounds fun.

today i didn't do much of anything. I found a graduation check i had forgotten to deposit, and i got my check from moes that i had never picked up in the mail. free money days are fun. thats another great thing about graduation. the random checks. they suit me well."

"event","So my mom just comes in my room while I am playing hearts on Yahoo and gives me a HUGE bag of sour patch kids and a rockin' little box of gummy worms. Needless to say, 20 minutes later, my tongue is burning and I feel like I am going to puke. Oh how I love candy. And Yahoo hearts. I think i am actually too good at it. It's unhealthy. Sort of like all this candy I am continuing to eat. Mmmmm

So I had to leave my camping trip early to come back for work this morning, but it's all good. I went up to Grandfather mountain this weekend with the Junior Hi kids and helped lead. We went hiking, had devotionals, I played music around the campfire, played capture the flag with glow in the dark necklaces (AWESOME) and it was good times.

Before that, Thursday night I hung out with Bradley, Ginny and Samantha. (You'd never know it from their journals though, they don't even mention me being there). Well I had fun, we kidnapped Samantha after waiting like an hour and a half for her to get out of work. Beachgrad is gonna be awesome, i can't wait. I can't believe it's only like 5 days away.

pretty much, i just want to have a journal that i can look back at in time and be like wow that was really cool. so unless you just want to be interested in whats going on with me for some reason (i don't know who would want to do that) it will probably be pretty boring. you can just do what i do to most of you guys anyway and skip it. but hey, i'll see if i can't gouge for some comments at points too, because i mean you love them and i love them there is no denying.

might as well start now. summer pretty much is kicking in. i woke up at like 12 today at claytons, came home at like 5 maybe? clayton had fallen asleep on the couch not feeling well. i came home, called lauren, she came over and we watched top gun then tv. i watched mash after she left, which means it is officially summer. i have a summer tradition of watching mash every night before going to bed. i talked to bradley and ginny on the phone for a bit too, hopefully we will all be able to meet up tomorrow. well, i am staying at bradleys so i know we will. but ginny ought to come into picture at some point too.

Goin' to UNCG next year, pretty excited. Plans for the summer: going on a mission trip to Mexico, which will be incredible, and going to the beach twice, once for senior week and once with our annual ""Summit beach trip"" that i am going to be the only guy on apparently. Other than that, me and two of my best friends are leading a bible study on wednesdays. Good stuff. Dave Matthews Band shows on June 28th and 29th in Charlotte then Raliegh, and Carowinds on June 25th maybe? Regardless its gonna be fun. I'm working my normal job at the rock wall and looking for another one too, as I am now a poor college student officially.

In the interesting department, I cut myself on the adams apple shaving.

So there is a Winter Seniors Conference Staff meeting this weekend, and its going to rock hard. So I look forward to seeing all of ya'll there that are going to be there, plus I think you should all come back to my house afterwards to hang out, since the meeting is in Greensboro and all. So make it happen. Alert everyone that you will be a few hours later than scheduled upon arrival of your home. Now. ...Good.

For everyone that isn't on staff, you best be coming to winter seniors! It's Feb. 11-13 and is going to be pimped out. AND its not too early to start recruiting people for Happening either, it is March 11-13. And if you haven't been already, you ARE going this time, being the last one at the summit and all.

On that subject, I don't think I am really ready to face reality. Or even TRY to express anything I feel about it.

On a lighter note, my computer is just about gone for good due to viruses. Fund for a new computer anyone? Or how about the laptop I am asking for for graduation. Now would be a good time to get it!

Speaking of graduation, I AM GRADUATING. It is still dawning on me. College mess, is just that though. I don't have a clue what is going to happen after I cross that stage...

Thanks if you hung through all this, I miss all of ya'll, and I hope you are doing well.

"event","So it's thanksgiving, and I'm in charlotte with my family. Last night i went and hung out with a bunch of St. John's peeps (I've got pictures I can put up when i get home) and it was fun. The drive down here was the absolute worst car ride I have ever had. I could not get out of 2nd gear the entire trip down I-85. The normally 10-15 minute strip from Salisbury to 485 took an hour and a half. Not to mention the immense rain that was pouring down the entire time. ugh. And I still didn't get my hat back!

So my mom brought my senior pictures with her when she got here today. YAY! Everyone remember to ask me for one, I have so many wallets it's insane! My mom didn't get the pictures I wanted for my wallets though, but eh, whatever.

I'm willing to bet that today is the day of the year that has the earliest average bedtime. Think about it! Turkey makes you tired, eating alot makes you tired, everyone has family in town, so they aren't out all night, they are visiting with their family, not to mention most places are closed! It just makes sense! Happy Thanksgiving all!

"event","<P>FYI, the decision has been made to sell the Summit. Activities will resume at Brown Summit through Spring Youth 2005, but after that it will be relocated to a location being investigated. I have so many feelings involved in this, I have no possible way I could describe them in written form. What I can say though, is everyone better effing be at every single confrence this year! And never ever ever ever ever ever forget the memories you have had there, and work towards bringing the same feeling at the new location. I am sorry that I will not be able to help, SY is the seniors last confrence.</P>
<P>One more thing, it isn't called the <U>Summit </U>for nothing. I really think that the name isn't just a location, it is a feeling too. The Summit of my connection to God. The Summit of all the possible feelings I can experience. The Summit of experiences shared with some of the best humans around. The Summit of being completely open, <EM>completely</EM> fulnerable, and being more completely comfortable than you have ever felt. The Summit of my life. The Summit you havemaking a&nbsp;left on NC 150,&nbsp;right on Spearman, 1.4 miles down left on Confrence Center drive, down the windy road past 3 sets of speed bumps and through the gate that always seems to be open when you need it to. The Summit you have when you are getting ready for Bishop's ball, whether it is completely insane and will get a few laughs, or you are looking as beautiful as you can possibly be. The Summit you get hearing every mouth in the room, whether 50 or 300, singing a song during large group. The Summit you&nbsp;have when you look around during a healing service, and see <EM>everyone</EM> in tears.&nbsp;The Summit you&nbsp;have when youre leaving the Lodge and working your way to the train, passing over the bridge, the trail to the Ampitheater, the Pit and Upper Youth, and finnaly the mouth of magnificent cabin 1. The Summit you&nbsp;have leaving a meeting with your small group in confrence rm 100, the absolute best small group ever, tied of course with the small group meeting in the train, cabins, gym, lodge, gym bathrooms, anywhere you can <EM>ever </EM>imagine. The Summit you&nbsp;have leaving the room behind the Gym, where I slept my first Confrence. The Summit you&nbsp;have leaving the final Eucharist on Sunday. The Summit you have going through the open gate, past 3 sets of speed bumps, right on Spearman, left on NC150, and back to whereever it is you are coming from. The Summit you take with you after a confrence. The Summit you give to your family and friends the first time you see them after a confrence. The Summit I get remebering all of the Summit's I have had over the years. The Summit I get thinking of the countless smiles at any given confrence. The Summit I get knowing that wherever the Summit will be, it will always be the <EM>Summit.</EM></P>"

"event","Okay so I took a few days off. Here's the recap:

Friday I went to a play with Taylor. It was actually quite funny, with a really random ending. It was called Road, and I would recomend it to anyone who likes obsene humor and isn't easily offended. Haha, well afterwards we stopped by Hams and got some food. Then I dropped her off and went home. It was pretty fun.

Saturday was Keith's 18th birthday. He came back to town, and I got the idea to throw him a surprise party. So me and benson rounded up as many people as we could with less than an hour's notice (like 5) and all came over to Benson's. When Keith got there, me and benson went to ""get the cake,"" but really went and changed into our very elaborate outfits we had arranged for the now legal man. We put on some girls girls girls by motley crue and danced for him. It would have been 235624352 times funnier if bensons MOM HADN'T WALKED IN. So then we all went bowling and I stayed at Keith's house. We watched infomercials till like 5 and it was hilarious.

Sunday nothing really happened. I slept in on accident at Keiths, then went home and mowed the lawn. That's about all I did. Then of course nothing exciting ever happens during the week.

Not to get into it here, because most people don't care, but my mom is really pissing me off with this whole over protective mess. She fails to realize that I will be 18 in a few months, and living on my own in less than a year. Not to mention I will be going to boot camp more than likely, where there is no ""mommy."" She doesnt get it that any ""values"" she is trying to instill in me have already made their mark. The person I am now, and the person I become, no matter how she trys, will have next to nothing to do with her. If I can't live some, experience some, what does she expect me to do on my own?"

"event","<P>Alright I'm going to start updating this more regularly now...if&nbsp;I stop, poke me with a pointy stick or something.</P>
<P>I know people mainly are using these for venting and such these days, and that always annoyed me. That's a good reason why I stopped updating. However, I think I was just feeling that way because I don't normally have anything to vent about. Now that I do, I do like having the option to put it on here and get it off my chest. So sorry to all of you&nbsp;I judged silently.</P>
<P>Like I said, I do have something to vent about now. I normaly am a easy going guy, and it is hard to find me having a bad day. But today, it just was crap. First period in AP psychology I could not keep my eyes open to save myself. I hate that feeling, when I was actually trying to pay attention to the review for the test tomorrow. I was then looking forward to 2nd period, because we do absolutely <EM>nothing</EM> in there. I could finally get the sleep I needed in 1st. However, much to my dismay, we had a sub, and her name was Satan. This woman was the most ignorant, untrusting human I can remember encountering in the longest time. We had to do work out of the book, and there arent enough books. Also, she said we could not work in partners. How are the rest of the people supposed to do the work then? I asked, and the response was ""because&nbsp;I said so!"" Okay....So later in the period i need to go to the bathroom, so I ask to go. She says no, people aren't allowed to leave the room. Later, this chick asks to go, and she says yes, but says I have to go first since I asked first. But I didn't have to go that bad, so I let her go first. When she gets back, I get up to go and she tells me I can't go again. Getting pissed, I try and let it go and get back in my seat. I finish my work, and am just sitting there, doing nothing. Actually, I took a rubber band out of my pocket and was playing with it in my hands, just like rolling it in my fingers and stuff. She looks up and gets a horrified look on her face, jolts over to my desk, and snatches the rubber band from my hand! So now I'm like what the hell...and tell her so. It's not like rubber bands are illegal or anything, and she says I can get it back at the end of class. Now I'm quite pissed. Before the bell rings, I sneeze and get up to get a tissue. She starts yelling at me for getting a tissue! She also refused to believe that i sneezed. </P>
<P>Ugh, that was a horrible story I know but I don't care. The rest of the day sucked too. When I was home, I was reading someones LJ about how they had gotten stuff stolen from their locker, and I remember about the week I had something stolen from me every day, and my mood worsened just a little more. I went to work for my dad a little then, then went to the ""See you at the pole"" rally at Muirs Chapel. That was incredible. Even though I didn't know a single person there other than my youth minister, it is still such a great experience. It made me think about how I haven't been involved in the church enough lately, and how incredibly much I love and need it in my life. Lately, without it, I feel like I haven't had any direction in my life. And being around all the love, I feel more comfortable than anywhere else I can go. Ahhhh, I miss it so much! I am so freaking excited about Happening, I can't stand it! While I was there, I also chatted with my youth minister about a few of my friends, and things going on in their lives, that aren't exactly the way they need to be. Even though I was aware of these, and doing some to try and help, I realized that I am not nearly doing what I should. I just need God to grant me the strength to be strong when the time comes. So when I was leaving the church, I just get this sureal feeling of wow, this world is so completely screwed up. And now I can't stop thinking about it. About how people have no regard for others now. About how this is a world where you can't say ""Good job"" or ""Nice try"" and be taken seriously. And I really can't stand it. And THAT is where my bad mood is coming into play. So many things today have made me realize how horrible of a state we are in. And I think the only way to get back to where we need to be is to look to the sky. Take a stand for what we need to be doing in this world. Anything will do, and I think ""See you at the pole"" is a great idea. What it is is anyone intrested meets at the flagpole of your school at a designated time, and prays for whatever needs praying for. Prayer for the school, teachers, administrators, students, prayer for the nation, prayer for individual needs, prayer. I am afraid it is going to be a bust though. There were only about 5 people from my school at the rally, and noone that I have talked to is going. I think that is so disheartening too, that something as simple as getting up a little earlier to come to pray is so hard. Just a tiny more effort, and I really believe it can make a big difference. Goes back to the sad sad world we are in....If you are intrested in more info about it go to <A href=""http://www.syatp.com"">www.syatp.com</A></P>

well now im off for whitewater rafting, cedar point, the water park near cedar point, a christian concert, and a skatepark! not to mention the day and a half of time in a bus on the fabulous roads that are all connected."

"event","as I'm sure most of you know, the Summit is in serious financial trouble. it is being voted on april 22 on whether or not to be sold. we CANNOT let that happen. tell everyone you can, your parents, friends, siblings, ANYONE to send a letter to or even meet with your closest Diocesan Council representative. Kathy should be sending out an email that we have worked on together to everyone in the database. i am starting an egroup at yahoo that we can discuss ideas and other options there, but for now get that mail going for support! we dont need just sentimental crys and pleas, but actual factual informative arguements. do as much as you can!"

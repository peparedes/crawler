"event","Lexi is my lady.



long distance relationships don't work.
so i feel we'll either have to be very liberal, not 'go out', or just lie to each other all the time.



the truth of the matter, is that I'm content with out conversation.
she's the only person since katie, I felt I've connected with, and I cal honestly say this time it's not physical.
I need something more than the physical.
it's gross how easy that stuff comes to me.
I have endless charm, and the wit to match.
I am mildly good looking, but my smile kills.
and I am extremely confident.
but get this, i am nervous enough to not want to go on sunday.
how scary is that. freaky i know.
I am so fucking nervous.
what if my lips don't reach her fore head.
what if we get together and we're both so rusty, we aren't even attracted to each other.
what if....















can you still feel the butterflies?"

"event","and the worst part is, only half of that is what I really feel.

only so many times I can call her amazing and perfect before I break down again.


I literally lied there in her bed with her today, again. you know that feeling you body gets when you really wanna be close to someone.
like you ache, start shaking and can hardly control your hands....


I was like that all night.

and I wanted her to read some advice I gave someone cause she thinks I'm nothing but an ass hole on livejournal (p.s. I gave the advice because I felt it, not to impress her)

and she reads the line about cheerleading


she wouldn't talk to me all night, with the exception of five seconds before she dropped me off.


this is only because she can't deal with her emotions in person.
she bottles everything up, and the only time I've ever seen her spill anything out, is in a live journal entry.

which is better than nothing I guess but still:

'ps ""cheer lead"" is not correct usage




anddd ur an ass.'


first entry of last night


here's: the second""
""im not even mad that u said it. no wait. i am. more so the fact that i said in my post u appreciate people for who they are and dont want them to change. and clearly this isnt true. u completely proved that wrong just now. how could u write it then have me read it then deny that it was about me. u want to know how i feel well thats it. i turned on my computer just for this.""


it's not like I don't know I'm ass for saying it, but I honestly wasn't thinking about her when I did.

if i was, whythefuck would I show it to her.


you'd think stupid things like this would die in highschool, but it didn't.
cause I've never stopped liking her.
I still like her.
I will continue to like her.
I don't see her liking me anytime soon.


















but goddamn I'd murder to stop my shaking againt her body."

we watched movies at her house last night.
it was candy man, it was quite scary.
we scared all the girls, me brad and vec that is.
brad is the same, but vec is fuckin' ripped.


anyway, 

the only time she came remotly close to me was when I had ice cream.


but the entire night, eyes were ours.
if I had a dollar everytime I caught hers eyes last night.


the were ours, I like that, that'll be my ""thing about her that she dosen't know is about her this week'
 thing"

"event","Man I can't win with this girl, 
its impossible



I haven't used this journal in forever, I wonder if anyone still reads it, I don't think anyone ever did.


I called kate the other day. we talked for 30+ seconds.

I see dill almost every other day.
she had to know I like her.
and at first I didn't care weither or not she liked me back



I kinda do now, more so because she isn't happy.

I have yet to do anything to get her to stop talking to me tho, but hey she has a bad night maybe I can capitalize on it...

thats what a normal guy would say, but no, I just want her to be happy, and have a better day.
granted I belive she'd have several better days with me, but thats not the point


God, I just want to lay in someones bed all day."

Its so backward.


I get yelled at on the phone in the middle of the day to come home and do a whole bunch of shit, then I come home and I'm not in trouble at all.


my mom: ""nag, complain, nag, nag, double complain""
me: ""you we're the one who wanted me home""
mom: **hangs up**


its so assbackwards it hurts.
I need a drink. 
my mom asked me how much I drink, I told her as much as she does.


You don't know, but I'm right.
You don't even know what I'm talking about, 
and the person who can read this, isn't the person.
But goddamn.
so have fun, lie about it, I'll be at school.

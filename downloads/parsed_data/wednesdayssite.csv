Do you recall that winter evening
The night that i said i'm leaving
Hoping
You would change my mind

I lay my head up on your kness and
Whispered please but inside i was
Leaving
I'm the leaving kind

I could put you off forever
This longing has no end

How long
Til you and i can be together
How long
Until we see this through
How long
Until we know that this is forever
How long
Til i say i love you

And when the burning leaves are falling
I can always hear you calling
Fearing
That we are losing ground

But in you secret hearts we're knowing
Our love is winter and it's snowing
Falling
Comfort coming down

I could put you off forever
This longing has no end
Advertising lasts a lifetime
If not now then when?"

"event","Today was an interesting day. This whole week actually.....
Got asked on a few dates Woo-Hoo! :0)

Hmmmm.. I seem to be a year older but yet still look younger...
Woo-Hoo again!! hehe! You haven't seen nothing yet! Wait until I'm done loosing my last 20 lbs! :0)


I kept get these damn Migraine headaches all this week though. You know the sensitivity to light & nasuea etc. So I was telling my friend about it at work and her response - Is something on your mind maybe? Because sometime's if your thinking too much, have alot on your mind, or even stress can cause that. Very interesting I didn't think of that. I kinda drew a blank when she asked me. I mean stuff's been on my mind but I have been ignoring ALOT that's been going on. Just for my own sanity. Best thing for me really. I feel much better then I have in a long time not having thing's on my mind or worrying or dealing with negative people who were in my life. I've been saving money too which is a great feeling. The greatest feeling in the world for me right now is that I feel free and I am doing what I WANT for once. Plus I don't have to answer to anybody but myself!

Tonight I had to go back into work to pick up my check (So I didn't have to go in again on my day off.) I got there much later then I had thought I would. On my way out Roger asked me if he could catch a ride with me to the train station. I haven't been eating much lately so I was starving and about to grab some food somewhere so I asked him if he would like to join me. He said sure so we went to Mama Sbarros and got some food. I had a good time! He is one of the people I enjoy talking to most at work :) It was really sweet he paid for my dinner too :) Glad I asked him to get together :)

It's weird how lately I just don't want to eat. I've been doing this for weeks. I won't eat anything during the day, I just get real thirsty and constantly drink seltzer, Light Lemonade or Iced Tea at work. Just basically I'll eat a small dinner at night and that's all I seem to want. (I've even been staying away from the food at work.) I did go to McDonalds later tonight and got myself one of those Fruit & Walnut Salads though. It was good but it was so hard finishing it. It took me an hour just to eat that thing but I know I really needed to eat.

Ahhhh time to watch more of my Who's The Boss boxset ::Smiles::
Don't laugh but I have been renting lots of dvd's from my public library. It's free so you can't beat that. Plus you get to keep them for a week. One boxset I rented was the first season of Dawson's Creek. I forgot how good the first season was.... I know I'm cheesy but the whole Joey & Dawson thing reminded so much of my old neighborhood guys and how we hung out at the lake! And we used to make movies like that with all my friends haha! :0)

Reminder to myself, Remember to burn Erwin some cd's for this weekend since he will be down from New Hampshire :)


P.S. Bobby just wanted to let you know I think your mad cool :0)"

I feel so drained lately. Just catching up on a busy weekend.
Sometime's my thyroid bother's me and makes me feel sick.
I don't like that feeling but it happen's sometime's. It would
be nice to be hugged in my sleep when I feel sick like this :(

Other then that I have been feeling really good & have been trying not
to think of thing's that have been going on. Alot of people have said to me I can do alot better in the boyfriend department and I believe their right. I was telling my good friend the other day that he as my friend treat's me better way better then my ex has been treating me lately. Something to think about.... I really believe one day he will realize what he lost....
Life works in funny ways sometime's if something is truelly meant to be it will keep bumping into you and eventually people wake up and realize things. Love can be tricky, You can walk away ""still"" loving a person not because you wanted to stop loving them but because they stopped loving you and you had to walk away. Sometime's they still love you but are too stubborn to admit it and walk away for whatever reason. I for one always let someone know exactly how I feel about them before I walk away. I don't like to leave thing's unsaid because I might never get that chance again to say how I really felt....

My Ex called me to wish me a Happy Birthday on my Birthday. I was really surprised because I didn't expect that....

Work's been going well. I really like the group of people I work with. Their good people :) Me & Roger always get into these deep coversations at work. I love our convos. We always have something to talk about or joke about :) Same thing with Mario. He's really funny & jokes around alot. Sometimes I give my friend Mario rides near my house because he works a 2nd job a block away from me. And the other night I'm getting out of my car and I hear JULIE, JULIE. And I'm looking around because in the dark I didn't know who it was. And as soon as I heard his voice I went is that Mario? LOL! Him & his friend started laughing. And he was like yes it's me hehe! I'm like OMG Hey Mario! He was walking to catch the train & he had seen me drive by :)

It's funny but I always have alot of guy friend's. It's really rare that I hang out with any girl's. I think it's because alot are really catty and I'm not. Guys just say how it is and I think that's why I enjoy their company more. I'm friend's with a couple girl's from work their actually really cool because their not typical girls or catty at all.

Tonight I had some some of my left over Strawberry shortcake B-Day Cake & watched some of my ""Who's The Boss"" boxset my parents got me :) I love 80's show's like that. It's been so long since I watched alot of those show's that its like watching them over for the first time again. I also got the dvd Good Will Hunting too. Such a great movie! I love watching movies curled up in my bed with my big poofy IKEA blankets. My cat also curls up with me :) I call her my little itty bitty. She always keeps me company.

Can't wait to go to The Witches Brew again - I absolutely loved it there! So my scene. I don't even care if I meet anyone. It's a great place to go with friends and it's just somewhere I can go be myself. :0)

I like Myspace, But it's a confusing place. It makes my head hurt sometimes lol!

Been changing my Music website & other websites. They needed some updating. I can't wait to add music samples to my site for everyone to hear. I believe this is the year of change for me. Positive change. And I've needed this for such a long time.... Prepare to see a new Julie emerge! :0)

  It's My Birthday!
Current mood: cheerful 


 

mood:  Cheerful

It's My 31st Birthday Today :) I'm glad I don't look 31 atleast lol! ::Smiles:: Just last week someone told me I reminded them of their neighbor. And the woman says ""You look about her age too she's in 11th grade"" So naturally I started to laugh. And I said ""Actually I'm 30 and will be 31 nex't week!"" She was in shock and couldn't believe I was much older. She felt so bad & I said No it's ok alot of people think I look younger, Thanks for the compliment! :0)

Today I went to a BBQ out East for my Birthday with Friends & Family. I had a really nice time. My mom makes the best food! Sipped some Strawberry Daiquiris. :) The weather was so beautiful out today too :) Went down to the old neighborhood Lake with Bill to take some pictures for old time's sake. They just put in a new dock, floating dock & bridge. One of us expected to get pushed in the water at some point haha! Just like old times :)"

"event","Went out with my friend & my sister for my Birthday to California Pizza Kitchen & then after to The Witches Brew! (Got lost in the ghetto for awhile but we finally made it out and found the place! lol! Long story haha!) Had a really great time! This place is amazing! I felt so refreshed! What a great place to go for my Birthday! It's totally my scene. It's an old house with dark gothy decor, Blue lights in every window, Hanging On the fireplaces to the blue chandeliers, big comfy couches with blue candlelit tables. The Menu was huge & it was just coffees, Teas & Desserts. It took forever for us to order because the menu was so big! They had the most interesting kinds of drinks & desserts with ghoulish names hehe! I had this Blue Moon drink which was huge it was an Italian soda with Blueberry, Vanilla & marshmallows on top :) And the dessert my god chocolate overload with the Mississippi Mud cake!! My sister got her tea served in this little black gothic witch tea pot. (I so want one of those!) It was such a nice night out too, warm enough the doors were open & a nice breeze was coming into the place. As soon as we pulled up you could see the employees cars. It's nice to know I'm not the only one who enjoys driving and old car! I saw a nice blue 57 chevy & a few other 70's car's! It's such a great place to hang out order some good tea's or coffee and talk with your friend's! It was a very mixed crowd too.... My sister and friend liked it and we plan to go back soon :)Leaving here I defenitely felt, lofty, edgey and contained :0) I defenitely Plan to go here around Halloween time too!"

I can't wait to see this movie! I love Star Wars just as much as the nex't person but the people who camped out days before just to see a midnight showing was alittle much haha! I mean hell I would of went if I got tickets but no camping out! I'll just wait the few weeks till I can actually get a seat! 

It's funny how I missed being online when I wasen't able to get online. I really don't know why I did. I didn't miss much. Now that I'm here people haven't been around as much or acting quiet. Oh well. The online world is a little strange at time's. I'll tell you though it's real nice to have access to my music though! 

Damn I've missed out on recording Garbage on The Letterman show & other things because I wasen't online for a month and didn't even hear about it until I got back online :( Anyone have a copy of that I can copy? (Disappointed) I really want to buy the new Garbage Concert T- Shirts but I haven't seen any to buy yet.

Well I'm single once again & going to be 31 in a few days. It feels like De Ja Vous, I spent my 30th birthday like this too. Same Guy, Similar reasons. Infact it always happens 2 weeks before my birthday or His for whatever reason. This time I feel a little bit of relief though. I feel a real positive change coming on. I need a change. I'm trying not to think of thing's. And it's about time. It's nice to be free. This is what I remind myself everyday ""I did everything I could do & now it is totally out of my control.""  ""If it is truelly meant to be, in time it will fix itself."" Thanks to all of you who posted me some really great advice on the subject of my ex! That was some of the best advice I have gotten :) 

I'll be honest though for anyone getting to know me right now- be patient with me. I'm trying to approach thing's with an open mind but I may get freaked at time's. It take's me awhile to trust anyone or fully warm up to someone. 

Been taking alot of photography pics for my music website and portfolio. Soon to be posted on my site. I've been doing photography since high school and it's something I really enjoy.... Especially Black & White Photography...."

Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of
falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just take the rotten apples from
the ground that aren't as good, but easy......... The apples at the top
think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing.
They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the one who's
brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree.

Share this with other women who are good apples, even those who have
already been picked!

Now Men... Men are like a fine wine.

They begin as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the shit out of them
until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

"event","Oh man. This week has been weird. I felt soooo sick. I felt like I was going to die almost. I looked so ghost white all week, had a hard time working came home early a few days. (All cause of my thyroid) Ain't it lovely. The Red Bull truck was at my job today & Mario got us lots of free Redbull! You rock Mario cause I've been wired all day on Redbull! Yeah I know I probably shouldn't have drank it but I needed the boost! I'm waiting to crash real hard after that one lol! Ok lately I don't know what it is I haven't been eating as good as I have been. Either I haven't been eating at all or I want Chicken Strips with Honey Mustard, Iced Tea or Bacon cheeseburgers with extra pickles. Bad I know. It's really weird how I'm so craving those 3 things. It's so not like me. Cause I've been soo strict with what I eat for quite sometime. Maybe it's a phase? Went on a Chinese food run for my coworkers. It kinda happend by accident so it was funny. And I went to my favorite Chinese place & hooked up my job with good food from a place they haven't tried yet & yeigh! they deliver - so when I told them they were like sure we'll deliver to your job anytime just give us a call :0) Sweet... Is it bad to mention I am still seeing so many good looking Asian guys in my town? Should I wear a sign? ""This white chic digs asian guys?"" You think I will get some attention that way? hehe! Oh man an especially lately I constantly notice I mean REALLY GOOD LOOKING guys too! Ok sorry I don't go for the william hung types lol, (William hung seriously scares me ok lol!) I don't go for all types! But damn theres alot of you are so damn nice looking daily with such amazing eyes and GQ-ish faces. It's odd. Maybe there's something *Special* in the Syosset water haha! Welp soon I will be starting a new job at another Insurance company. I'm so happy about it! My pay will be much sweeter and I can be more creative! I'll be on the computer mostly at my job which I will enjoy! I need to start saving up for a list of thing's I need to do for the year. #1 moving into a bigger place, #2 Getting some bill's paid off :0)

Hmmm....

Roger's so cool man. Mario too. They make my job so much more fun. It's like constant jokes all day. Me & Roger get into these deep discussions on stuff. My manager Steve was laughing at as he's like wow I think you guys have covered it all! From Religion, Life, Food, Movies, Jokes, Issues, Interacial stuff, The difference between guys n girls, rude people, making fun of things, To music, You talk about everything haha! I have to admit the Michael Jackson jokes are damn funny - Michael Jackson looking like Captain Crunch on his trial! hahahaha! Also thought it was funny when I said I was part asian, roger's like ""Your Black, Your one of us, damn grrrl your a sister hahaha!"" Yes I've been in accepted into the posse since I'm the only white chic at my job lol!

I have to say my managers Wanda, Steve & Gary, I think are the coolest managers I've ever had..... Kudos to you guys for tolerating my car always stalling or not running in the morning (Especially during the winter) Everyone was worried about me being sick too and called to see if I was ok and was constantly asking me if i was alright... :0)

Eddie taught me a new word F.O.B. Asian's mean's Fresh Off The Boat Asians hahaha! Thanks Eddie I've been edgibicated hee-hee!"

"event","All & All today was a good day :) It was about 65 degrees outside even through the night. As soon as I got out of work I rolled my windows down in my car & blasted my new wave! I felt good & refreshed while drinking a big huge thing of free lemonade :)Funniest thing happend today. My friend roger was eating and accidentally stepped on some ketchup packets on the floor. It was so loud it sounded like a gunshot. And the ketchup from the ketchup packets managed to hit each and every one of us from head to toe in a range of 12 feet haha! It looked like a crime scene hahaha! It even hit the walls and ceiling LOL! The funniest thing was seeing his reaction when he realized he hit almost everyone of his co-workers! With this oh shit look on his face responding in this cute voice ""Sorry Everyone!"" Tee-Hee :) Defenitely was amusing :)To describe roger he's a big black guy who looks like he could be my body gaurd - so for him being cute is so damn cute hehehe! Roger rebought the Shottas movie (The one my vcr ate, I offered to pay for a new one but he said don't worry about it, It's no problem) So he went out and bought the DVD & Leant it to me & also leant me his Wayne wonder cd & Reggae videos! (I felt so bad about the tape I made him some cd's & gave him some Thai Iced Tea which he likes.) Plan to watch the movies tonight! Ran around and did some much needed errand's and went a few town's over to this old Retro Gas Station Circa. 1940's to take some picture's for my music website since it was such a nice day out :)I love old stuff. I plan to take some picture's around the house because my place is Circa. 1940's too and alot of thing's are still original :) Sometime's you just need to get out and do something creative. And especially more often when you have a robot kind of job. It's what keeps my creative ideas going. I always need to be doing something interesting, It's hard to sit still too long. And if I see something cool to take a picture of I have to go and stop and take a picture of it! I have so much more I want to accomplish over the year! I know I can do it, But I know it will take time. I know thing's will be looking up more and more as I go along. But I guess sometime's you have to go through a bad time first until you reach the positive place where you want to be. I plan to start saving up again for a list of thing's that I want to do over the year.... Should be cool. First priorty is getting my own place which mean's being able to get all of my furniture and thing's out of storage that's have been in there for a year! Can't wait to be in an apartment again and use all my thing's that I've missed! :)


Party Cake Ice Cream Kicks Arse! Woo-Hoo!
Ditto for Tin Roof! (R-U-S-T-E-D) Hee Hee!

My kitty can be sooo cute but yet be such a little monster! HaHa!
You should see all the troubles she gets into. But in the morning as soon as she see's my eye's open she does a Garfield and get's  in my face and purrs & meow's until I feed her breakfast haha! Which is the cutest :)

Ok my neighbor's, They really need to stop getting pet's! All their pet's turn into outside pet's and this new puppy they got is so cute but is constantly put outside and cries with this squeaky loud bark outside my window every morning and ALL day for hours. It likes to dig under the fence and escape. They leave it outside all night & day whe they go somewhere. Wakes me up every morning argggghhh... When it come's down to it I just feel bad for the dog and want to say to them just let your damn dog inside! I'd even adopt it! I just feel bad for it! Even their cats sadly look in the back windows like ""Let me inside!"""

Venting, Venting, Venting..... That's me lately. Thank god for a journal where I can constantly complain and no one get's mad at me for it lol! I can just vent away.

Ok My Ex Or Man Or Boyfriend. That's a great way for me to explain him because I couldn't tell you what our status is to tell you the truth. All I know is he is either coming back in my life or doesn't want me in it. Depending what his mood is. Sometime's he care's for me or sometime's he does stupid thing's I can't explain. Sometime's he has a temper, he get's upset and blow's up over little thing's sometime's he doesn't. Sometime's he treat's me like a princess, sometime's he ignore's me. The more I ignore him the more he want's to see me, the more I pay attention him the more he ignores me. Go figure. He won't tell his family he sees me because he care's too much what they think, But yet he still see's me. He love's my gothy side and my hair but yet won't say to his family hey this is what I like! If they knew he was seeing me again this year he would never hear the end of it, So he doesn't say anything to them. Sometime's he's a bachelor, sometime's he's not. Sometime's I'm single, Sometime's I'm not. On & Off this year we're either dating or not. He takes me out on date's pays for me and all that. We spent alot of weekend's and our days off hanging out or staying at each other's places snuggling when we fall asleep at night. He'll do sweet little thing's for me like cleaning off my car when it snow's or making me dvd's or giving me Police picture's of himself. He'll always ask how my family is. Really had hoped one day we'd get married but he can't seem to tell me an answer over this past year or what he want's. He told me my job's not good enough for him. He want's someone that makes more money so *HE* can live more comfortably. It all comes down to money. Or him. Money is important but it's not everything. So I'm tired of not knowing. I'm tired of not having a yes or no answer. Tired of caring for someone who doesn't give 100 percent back like he used to. I'm tired of not being good enough for him. I'm tired of wasting my precious time for him for him only to end up with someone else and me ending up being hurt in the outcome. I'm tired of trying, explaining myself or changing for him. I'm tired of walking around on eggshells around him to please him. I'm tired of not being able to know everything that's going on. So I gave up because I know I deserve better. I deserve 100 percent of someone's attention everyday!! Not randomly. But yet it's like a big trick he care's about me and can be soo damn perfect at time's and other time's he doesn't care about me all and only care's about himself. My friend think's he's Bi-Polar. He might honestly be.... So I know he has sent me on a huge rollercoaster ride at time's over the past 2 years or so. And I believe I have finally gotten off that ride for the time being.... And I'm finally feeling like me again. Hoping to start a new chapter of my life.... Because there's only so much someone's heart can broken, Only so many time's you can try to glue it back together.

Seriously have some patience with me! Me + Trusting someone = A Long Time.....I need alot of attention. I won't lie. Don't smother me though cause that will only scare me off. But I like someone who like's to talk & will talk to me and give me their undivided attention. Someone who will listen to me when I ramble. Please don't ignore me while watching sports. I hate when guys do that to me lol! If you just explain to me what's going on in the game I'll be happy. Don't expect me to give the world to you in just one day. A world take's time.... If you go to fast and try to rush me, I will shut down, It will majorly turn me off and I will most likely talk to you less or not at all. When your too high on yourself, That turn's me off too. When I'm mad at you I will get quiet until I can't take anymore then I will finally say what's on my mind. Remember I'm a girl, We always say nothing's wrong. When we say that that means something is wrong and ask us what you did wrong. lol! I don't like when people criticize me, constantly correct me or order me around. If you do this to me (Especially ordering me around) I will most likely ignore you at first, Then tell you hell no I ain't doing that! Do it yourself! I don't dig when guys have meaningless flings with girls. Please tell me why you all do it? To be able to find out one truth of one male quality - That would be the one I'd like to know about. I just don't understand the logic behind it. Can someone honestly tell me the point and explain it to me? I won't judge, I just want to know why is all.... Hey even the people you love do this to you too, Trust me I know, it's not aimed at any one person, Just alot of guys do it is all. I guess alot of girls are different in that way. I dunno.


God lately I have the worst insomnia... I hate when that happen's ugh. So I'm up again trying to get some thought's outta my mind.... One day everything will make sense I hope. Damn Thyroid. It's amazing how much your thyroid contol's your entire body and mind. Before I was on medication it was horrible. It turn's out I had a thyroid problem for quite a few year's but it went undetected. I didn't feel right for quite sometime and I knew something wasen't right. For year's they did all these test's didn't know what was wrong with me. Didn't know why I was getting heart palpitation's, Dizziness, anxiety, panic attacks or couldn't sleep. To explain myself then, I was like a different person. When I went on medication I became me again and all these symptoms disappeared. Sounds weird I know. One of my Best Friend's Bill has the same thyroid problem as me. Same exact thing happend to him too. 2 December's ago I got soooo thin because my thyroid problem is the one that make's you loose weight, I was the thinnest I had ever been and I looked so sick. My face got all sunken in and my eyes actually bulged a bit. I was constantly hungry and thirsty. So thirsty I could never seem to quench my thirst. Could eat anything I wanted and would keep loosing weight. I felt like I was going to faint and would turn sooo ghost white pale because they found out I was anemic (Also caused from my thyroid condition) Some women would say this is a gift, Trust me it's not. It messes with your mind when you don't get your time of the month. Throw's your body off whack. I didn't get my time of the month for like 5 years! Again because of my thyroid. Trust me when I say your thyroid does freaky things to your mind and body.... I got reoccuring pheumonia for month's. (reoccuring sickness' is common when your not on medicine) Never was so sick before in my life. My hair was falling out alot, Thank god I naturally have really thick hair so no one could tell as much. I had extremely dry skin and would get really bad eczema. All again from my thyroid. I'll tell you the worst part of it all was getting Heart Palpitation's and Panic Attack's constantly. I felt as if I was going to have a heart attack or I was going to die. That's how bad it was. I honestly hated that feeling when that would happen to me. When my boyfriend & I lived together he would hug me at night and try to comfort me telling me everything was ok. So many time's I used to get up at night and watch T.V. too, Sleeping used to be so hard to do then. I was afriad to sleep because as soon as I'd try to sleep my heart would race. Thank God medication fixed all this.... 

 
Have I confused anyone yet? LOL! Cause I sure have confused myself lol!

Man do I love the lyrics to this song!
Well written! This is my favorite part of the song --> ""A locked door on a candy store is what you are"".... And also ""The sun will rise without you"" How true is it that a guy breaks your heart but the sun sun will freaking rise anyway even if he's not there with you. LOL! Makes me feel better anyway cause it's true!

This is a good I'm over you kinda song!
Notice it's my theme lately....HaHa! Yeah but it's all part of the healing process....


""Paul Carrack - Don't Shed A Tear""

Cab fare to nowhere is what you are
A white line to an exit sign is what you are
Oh but I saw in you, now I see through

Don't shed a tear for me, my life won't end without you
Long as the night will be, the sun will rise without you
A locked door on a candy store is what you are
A slim chance in tight pants is what you are
All that I loved you for, I want it more
You ain't giving what I'm not taking
I'm not missing what we ain't making
Oh but I saw in you, now I see through

Don't shed no tears,
I don't need , I don't need
I don't need a thing"

"event","#1. I've said this before, but I'll say it again. What the hell's with guys having broken fingers? Pisses me off. This goes for friends, boyfriend's, ex boyfriends whoever you are. Please for the nex't person who date's me please learn how to use the phone or the computer. It's so easy to do but yet so many's guys constantly have dumb attacks and don't know how to do either....

#2. Stop being, Lying, Playing, Cheaters. When you do these thing's to me it is very hard for me to forgive you or look at you in the same way again. 

#3. My friend said I am having withdrawal symptoms (Which was very well put) from my previous relationship. Man Am I ever. I hate that feeling. Somedays I'm in this fog, somedays I try not to think about it etc, Somedays I feel a bit upset or confused. Somedays I try not to get together with him even when either of us want's to. If no one understand's me lately this is why. I don't even understand myself lately. If any of my friend's could give me some advice right now I'd really appreciate it. I'll be honest this has been the toughest thing I've had to go through. It's so hard to stop caring for someone who you thouught was the person you were going to marry and have your kids with. We had our whole life planned and I just have to walk away like it never existed. It's hard to accept that him & I failed. The feeling is like not knowing the answers to an unsolved puzzle. Ha! My relationship is like a Rubiks Cube! Something you can never solve! lol! Yes I'm the kind of person who cover's thing's up with humour though I'm really crying on the inside. But honestly I'll try anything to get my mind off this or feeling like this.

#4. I always need new music because it makes me feel better. Gets my mind off of stuff. Refreshes me and says the words I have trouble saying.

#5. Since I have moved last year. More and more I'm becoming the person I used to be again. And it feels great! For so long I wasen't me. And I didn't like that. Word to the wise never change for someone else. Worst thing you could do to yourself. Tell them to accept you for you are. Because once you change for somebody, You have to work twice as hard to get your old self back.

#6. I want to go to Scotland & Ireland soon. I know if I go I will feel fully refreshed diving into my family heritage and history. Scotland and Ireland is in my blood, Proud of my heritage everyday, I think about it everyday, Everyday I wonder what it would be like to live there. And yet I haven't been there yet. But I know everyday there I will love it and somehow I know exactly what it's like even though I haven't seen it with my own eyes. Because of all the stories my family tells me....


#7. Oh gawd I feel so bad! My friend Roger leant me his movie on vhs called ""Shottas."" It's a Jamacian movie. And my VCR ate the tape! This is a very hard to find movie and it was his favorite movie! (Me frantically looking for somewhere to buy it to replace it for him!) Sorry Roger!

#8. Man I've been working sooo much. I'm just exhausted.
But yet I have the kind of job that is repetitious. Meaning it get's boring quick. You feel like a robot. At time's it can be cool too because I have my friend's there but I hate when I can't be creative at a job. My personality is the kind that I always need to be busy doing something new. I need creative thing's to do. I'm a Gemini, I like to keep it interesting. I'm so craving a job switch right now, I keep looking around but I haven't found anything yet. I need more money and hour, That's my main issue. Hope I find something soon, I need to get out of this rut!

#9. Man this new Garbage - Bleed like me kicks arse! Just what I needed at a time like this! Man I want to go to the concert. Anyone want to go with me it's in April?

#10. I'm walking away from, Walking away from things in my own past - Information Society....


Interesting thing I read today....

Research says people who were in a marriage or longterm relationship for many years. It usually takes them 2-3 years to get back on track and get things back to normal again after a split up. Interesting...."

"event","I've finally figured out what's getting to me. I'm making the transistion from living with someone, to dating them, Then not dating them, Then dating them on & off again, Over and over again. No wonder why I'm confused!! No wonder I don't know if I'm coming or going or what the hell my heart feel's like anymore. I have to say going through that transistion has been the hardest thing for me. It pull's you rheart in so many direction's. Pretty much no one understand's me or why I'm heartbroken. Most of my friend's have never lived with anyone that long, Or thought they found the one. So when you try to explain it to them they don't really understand where I'm coming from. Now I'm just trying to get to know new people and yeah I want to but naturally I'm scared a bit. Scared of that big change. Because I am sooo comfortable with my ex and to me it feel's like am I going to be just as comfortable with someone else? So for anyone who's getting to know me as of right now, Please have patience with me, Because my heart's been crushed bigtime, I've been through alot these past few years. Go slow and take time to get to know me. Don't get mad at me if I freak out about some thing's. Believe me I DO want to get to know someone new because I think I deserve better then what I currently had. I have alot of love to give to someone, especially the right person :) Especially someone who can except me for who I already am...."

"event","Currently I'm sad. Yep I'm really sad. Really confused. Trying to make sense of my life. I am either ignoring things putting on a happy face or breaking down crying because I'm so damn broken hearted. Wondering how I can possibley still have feelings for Sonny when all he does is confuse me and not give me the answers I need. He has it so easy, He gets to be a bachelor but yet see me at the same time (saying he cares) not giving me the answer if he wants to marry me or what our future holds. So I have decided to move on and meet new people.... I think it's the best thing I could do for myself because he obviously cares about himself and what his family wants. Not what we wanted together. There's only so much you can try to fix something. You have to both want it to be fixed for it to work. And I already put in over 15 years of friendship and commitment. Honestly my heart cannot take another day of not knowing what my future holds. I guess you can say I went through alot with my ex & his family. I put up with alot of things I shouldn't have. For my nex't relationship I have I want to take the good from this relationship with Sonny and make sure I don't have an repeats of the bad parts of me & His relationship. Any girl should not have to go through what I went through. I'm still recovering from alot of bad things that had happend to me. And I guess you can say I'm having trouble fully trusting people because of it. You don't know how badly I want to move on. But man I tell ya it's so hard when you spend that much time with someone and just have to walk away. Its the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. It's like you found your soulmate in life and have to walk away, not because you want to, but you have to after you have tried everything and nothing worked. And basically all that time and love you invested meant nothing. Alot of my friends have told me no one should have to put up with the thing's I have put up with. Especially one's that supposively love you. And that I deserve much better. I agree with them I do deserve much better. And I hope the nex't guy I date it is.... My sister said the other day & I agree with her She said ""It's his loss he missing out on something really good and if he can't see that then he's an idiot."" I feel as if time is ticking away, I can't wait forever for someone. It's not fair to me. I deserve to have a family just like anyone else does, I also deserve respect, I deserve someone to treat me right. I deserve what everyone else deserves - Happiness....

You know it's weird at time's how you meet cool people when you least expect it. I have alot of good friends at work, even if I don't have the greatest job. They make my job bearable because their great company and they have my back if I'm stuck. 

And you know what? Just wanted to say I really enjoy talking to you Eddie. Your really cool :0) Hope to get to know you better.... You seem so down to earth with a cool attitude and you understand alot of things I'm saying.... Totally on the same wavelength especially with all the Asian/White issues. It's nice to know there's people out there with stuff in common. :0)

Oh yeah & a shout out to Kevin - your cool too! Miss working with ya :)"

Sonny is CONSTANTLY loosing himself a cool chic! My patience is wearing VERY thin. He's lost me quite a few time's this year because he doesn't know how to treat me & he doesn't know what he has! (Hence why we don't live together anymore!) Enough said...


I want a guy that knows what he wants, Isn't selfish,
& knows the meaning of R-E-S-P-E-C-T! Am I asking too much to be treated right? After all the crap I've been through this year I deserve to be treated right!

Over this year I plan to get a better job, Loose the rest of my weight & move into my own place. This is what will truelly make me happy! I started going back to the gym again after my short break & I am feeling great! I also decided to start dieting while I work out. One thing which has been hard for me is to cut out soda. But I have finally done it! I've always drank alot of water but now I strictly drink water, iced tea & juice the most. And I have been drinking diet caffiene free soda when the soda urge strikes me. (Which is hardly ever!) Which is truelly great for me! I'm proud of myself for that one :) The good thing with cutting soda out, The weight has been coming off much faster :) I've already lost quite a bit of weight over the past few years, but prepare to see a much different me soon! I truelly believe 2005 is the year for me, The year of complete change :) Soon I plan to go back to school again. I've decided to go into either interior decorating or broadcasting. Well see what happens :)

Want to know what my favorite scene from Dragon - The Bruce Lee story is? When Bruce Lee (Jason Scott Lee) Gets into a fight with Linda's mom about them getting married & runs out of the house in the rain & hops on his motorcycle. Then Linda comes out & yells Bruce! And he stops and gives her an intense look, picks her up & they ride off together in the rain! (Asian guys on motorcylces. Now thats hot! Hee Hee!) And Yes Sonny got a motorcycle. :0)"

Burrrrrrrrrr! It is bitterly cold outside!
(And there will be Snow too!)

*Guys confuse me*.....


<B>For 2005:</B>

#1 - JULIE comes first! Not the other way around anymore making myself last!

#2 - I'm cutting out negative people who only mistreat me & bring me down. (This includes Ex- Boyfriend's and Bad friend's) And this time I mean out of my life completely until they can change their ways! And if they can't achieve my goal for them? It's then completely out of my hands.... Their loss.... They will then realize what they had and that it is too late to get back what they lost.... A great girlfriend & a great friend is exactly what they lost!

#3 - Sometime's I tend to be too nice. Which can be a good or a bad thing at time's. This doesn't mean you can walk all over me. I do notice believe me. And when that happen's that's where my niceness ends....



<B>Funny Happening's</B>
My Manager Anthony - 
Look everyone there's 50 & 100 dollar bill's all over the floor! 
Look everyone! There's $30 Bill's all over the floor!!  Tee-Hee!
(The sad thing is everyone actually looked at the floor too haha!)"

This basically was the contents of my entire apartment which I have been sorting through for a year. I managed to finally part with a good amount of stuff that I didn't need! I can breathe alot easier now! I feel as if a huge weight has been lifted! A HUGE THANKYOU to my Dad & my friend Bill! I couldn't have done it without your help!

I brought back a few boxes of stuff from storage, Man did I miss some of this stuff that I had packed away for so long!! :0)


*I honestly have to say since the first day Sonny & me kissed back in 1993. From that day on I knew I wanted to be with him the rest of my life! When I kissed him the first time 12 years ago. I still have the same feeling for him today as I did then...... It's truelly an amazing feeling! That's just something that dosen't go away overnight. The passion for each other hasen't gone away at all...... I've dated other people before, But I have never felt like that with anyone else but him...... The day I ever find that same feeling with somebody else, I will truelly be speechless. Because honestly I can't imagine that feeling of Passion with anyone else but him....*

**Currently on 10 years of whatever this thing is with Sonny.... That's a real long time.... But I'll tell you the last 2 year's have been very confusing! (Thing's should not be this confusing in any relationship!)**


****Feeling's for Sonny seem to be inevitable! 
(Sigh)****

Sonny is like a drug I have to ween myself off of.
Me & Him together are pretty intense.When thing's are going well with him & I see him I get an ultimate high! But boy when thing's are going bad and he does stupid thing's to me (Because he relapses into the old him), Boy does he have this way of sucking that great high right out of me.... And these good time's are usually sucked away because he does not know how to control his anger.... Leaving me hurt and in a state of confusion...."

I have been real quiet the last few weeks or so. It's like that numb quiet when your walking around in a zombie trance. I guess that's a good way to explain how I feel. I guess I just have alot to handle at the moment. And I'm tired of dealing with certain things. And I am tired of dealing with certain people who like to piss me off. I've been doing ALOT of thinking! I think it's doing me some good. At the same time I completely redid my entire room. Yes I added even more IKEA items, Star lights, More Chinese lanterns. I've always had a Celtic, Asian and Celestial Sun & Moon theme to my home :0) My room looks so organized & comfy! I even have my own little kitchen area with a little fridge. I love it!"

"event","I keep seeing videos on the news showing amatuer video's of the Asian Tsunami sweeping people away. It's a scary thought how many thousand's of people it killed and so suddenly without warning. Especially that it was so bad that it even disrupted the earth's rotation. I have a bad feeling that it will be the start of other thing's happening around the globe.

I have been trying to keep a positive outlook on the thing's that have been happening to me lately. I really don't know why life turn's in the way that it does at time's. Or how the one you love can hurt you so much at time's but you continue loving them anyway. Recently I have gotten to the point I have been pushed a little too far and had to sit back and really take a look at the situation. I really still don't know what to make of it. I continue to look for a reason but somehow have not come up with any right or wrong answers. Only that I am really hurt. I know that I am really tired of dealing with thing's another person need's to change in his life. But unfortunately I don't think it will ever change and I am forced to look somewhere else for the happiness I deserve. Everyday it kill's me that I cannot change this person. Everyday I hope this person will magically change. But right now I try to live one day at a time. Every day I heal a little more and I am feeling much better with time. Because the last few years I have had my heart pulled in so many direction's I lost count. From this I find it really hard to trust anyone. I have decided that I am not going to go look for love, But to let love come looking for me. Love usually come's to someone when they least expect it...... That's  happend to me once before. Maybe it will happen again? I am such a different person then I used to be. So whatever path I'm suppose to go down, I am looking to a fresh new start....

<B>My New Year's Resolution</B>
To have postive - fresh - clean - start to the New Year!
To make more money & move into my own place soon!
To get back to the gym after my short break being sick.
To loose my last 25 lbs.
To shock people with my appearance when they see me nex't haha!"

If anyone has noticed an absence of not hearing from me, this is why. I just don't feel like talking to anyone right now. I need to be by myself for awhile to think. At this point I don't think anything can cheer me up. Not even music. And I love music. Plus I don't think anyone can possibly understand...."

"event","Has anyone ever dealt with a boss that is bi-polar, manic depressive and need's anger management that seriously needs help (But doesn't get help?) Plus I was sick and had a fever all at the same time. That was my day.. IT SUCKED! Please people spare us from the torture - do us a favor get yourself help & medication if your anything like my boss!!!!

I've been too sick to set up my new bed & new fridge for my room.
Ditto for my new christmas gift's I need to put away. So here it sits. I like to be organized, I don't like my room or house a mess so it's driving me nuts..........

Wow the doctor's have me on 2 good cold meds (one with codeine) plus my thyroid medication which causes me to be triple sleepy - triple yey! Warning use care when operating a car or dangerous machine's - hahahahaha!

How to nickel & dime food shopping this week - Buy one get one free items, bottle returns & free coupons for coke! Yes Christmas made me poor!

*To the DENSE GUY FRIEND'S in my life who only think of themselves.... Hint! Hint! When I ignore you that mean's you royally messed up and you should be kissing my butt bigtime!!* (Wouldn't it have been a bonus if God could have atleast created men on the same wavelength as women so we can actually understand each other?) No of course not that would have been too easy!!

On the brighter side - Stayed at Sonny's the whole weekend. Got to see him for Christmas. Which I was very happy about! Had a really nice refreshing weekend with him. He told me he was really happy to see me & was really glad I came over for Christmas. He was being real sweet..... Yeah I admit I am worried about him working in Time's Square for New Year's Eve. Even if I don't say it, I do worry......

HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!
I'll be going out East to celebrate :0)
     Have a good one!

I hope everyone likes their presents! Today is going to be a little chaotic at first (as usual). Then at night time when we go make the rounds to everyone's house's it should be less stressful and by then maybe I will feel a bit more relaxed.... You think we'll have snow?

I'm addicted to cute pajama pants! I can't get enough
of Hello Kitty, Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears or Cute little Kitty Pajama pants! I want them all!

God I love Hello Kitty stuff! Yes I admit I even have Hello Kitty Underwear hahaha! I grew up with all that stuff, Not to mention have all the little Hello Kitty things like a Hello Kitty clock, Clothes, You name it & I think it's so cool they now sell it for the big kid in all of us lol!

IKEA IKEA IKEA! Pretty much everything I own furniture & decoration wise is from this store! I love it! 

I like to collect CD's & DVD's!

I also like to collect different kinds of Buddha's, Jade jewelery, Celtic Crosses, Knotwork & Tapestries :0) I'm a big fan of plaid kilt's! I used to collect all kinds of different color Converse sneakers & Skidz pants too. Those were the days :0)

I like old cars. I think it's because my dad never had any son's. So he used to me along to all these car shows lol! Plus all my life I watched him work on car's. I'm a big fan of old Chevy's. My favorite's are Chevelle's & Nova's from the 1960's & 1970's and I've always wanted a Blue & White 1957 Chevy! Hey maybe Xzibit can ""Pimp My Chevelle"" LOL! I'd rather be driving an old car then a new one. But I admit the modern convenience, of FAST HEAT in the winter would be a plus with a newer car lol!

what to get me)

01. IKEA Gift Card's!

"event","Well this week my sister's boyfriend's family has been staying with us from Texas. They are trip, It's like having 4 clones of Trent running around lol! He has such a fun family lol! Cool southern accents too hehe! I've finally come to the point though I am not feeling so good and just soooo exhausted! Thank god I'm off tomorrow! Ahhh rest finally! They will be making a fried turkey tomorrow and having a little christmas party. :0) My sister's boyfriend Surprise party was pretty cool as well :) He had no idea everyone was going to be at the restuarant. 

Let's see today was kinda hell at work I was sick, wanted to stay home but I couldn't. This week went ok despite me not feeling well. I find myself talking to new people here & there at work. One guy is pretty nice looking :) Yeah but I'm aloud to say that because I'm single and my ex boyfriend chose to loose me after me giving him an ultimatum in October. He's had many chances to get me back. He's even had me back too. But hey this is the path he chose so I am free to do what I want! I don't know what he does but I do know I have caught him in certain lies about thing's (And he think's I'm stupid & don't know)I do know he goes out & parties and I'm sure he does not tell me everything he should. Maybe he does? At this point who really knows. All I know is I'm tired of trying to figure it out. I do have alot of friend's and I AM ALOUD TO GO OUT AND LOOK just like he does and secondly when I am with somebody I AM HONEST & I DO NOT STRAY! What's the point of lying? But if your not going to commit to me and still want to be a bachelor and have me then that's your own fault not mine. I don't have the time to put up with that. Either you want me or you don't - You can't have your cake & eat it too. You know what you have to do to keep me around. It's called a ring!! (And believe me I put in my time & then some.)

Odd I keep noticing alot of hot peirced white guys at work. Yes I did say white lol! One guy always has black nail polish on like me and he has a nose ring. Hmmm maybe I'm weakening my never date a white guy side? haha! Nah when I see a nice looking Asian guy it just erases all of that usually lol! I like what I like and 100 percent of the time if I see a nice looking Asian guy I look! 

You know how I posted a story about how I lost $200 dollars last week Christmas shopping? Well my Mom & my little sister did the nicest thing for me. The other day my mom put $100 and my little sister put in $100 of each of their money into my account for me so I could buy my medication and pay my bills! I thought that was so nice! But I feel so bad because they didn't have to do that. Thanks Mom & Bean :) And my friend Bill who went to the surprise party the other day also felt bad. And he paid for my dinner. Which he also did not have to do. The directions were real weird to the surprise party and I got real lost. And everyone told me my friend Bill was so worried about me he went out looking for me to make sure I was ok. He basically did not sit still until I arrived. As I drove he flagged me down in the cold. Isn't that the sweetest thing? Thank god I saw him! If he hadn't flagged me down I'd still be driving around Bellport somewhere lol! And I had forgotten my cell phone at home and my family/friends were all calling me to make sure I was ok. The whole time I was going where is this place, cursing up a storm I might add lol! Damn it was hard to find! 


I'll tell you though as soon as you feel as if the world has come crashing down on you, you really do find out the people who do care for you & help you out when your stuck. Thanks everyone :0)Thanks for offering to give me money for my medicine too Jan :0)

"event","Yeah I admit it's closer to Christmas and I find myself thinking of Sonny still. Honestly I hate to admit that. But how can you forget someone you invested about 9 years into? It's hard to do during the holidays... There is so much I miss about him but at the same time certain thing's he should change about himself.(And yet somehow we are still investing time into each other) Figure this - me & his status this year has been. Seeing each other again, Friends, Seeing each other again, friends. Where we will end up? Good question because I have no idea. Is it confusing? Yes. Do I want it to continue like this? No. There is only so many directions a heart can be pulled and I have about reached my limit even a few months ago.
I really miss being in an apartment and where I used to live. Not exactly where I lived but because I was sharing it with him. Just because it was ours and it was where we called home. Don't get me wrong I love where I live now. It's great, I have great company. But I miss my things and all the contents of my apartment that have been packed up in a 10x10 storage place for a year. Storage is expensive and I wish I had somewhere cheaper to store my stuff. I miss living out East at time's because I lived out there for quite sometime, I miss Port Jefferson also. Before it was a 5 minute drive, now it's a 45 minute drive in the christmas traffic from the mall lol! But at the same time I also like living in this town too, It also feels like home too because I have come to visit my grandparent's here for years. I guess when you pick your own town to call home and you really enjoyed it there (and you don't live there anymore) You miss it at time's because it's what your used to. I also miss having a boyfriend and best friend all in one that I did everything with. So much of our time was spent together and we really enjoyed each other's company too. We'd travel together, we liked the same things, same music, we'd joke around ALOT, we'd go out alot, or just snuggle on the couch with a throw blanket, make popcorn and watch movies. Whatever it was it was time well spent together. I liked that fact that I had someone who already knew me so well that I didn't even have to explain myself, he already knew what I was thinking. I miss having that with someone....."

"event","Let me start off by saying men are still confusing me. Please tell me does it get any easier? Or will men be a royal pain in the arse the rest of my life? The biggest thing for me is trust, Once trust is broken it's very hard to forgive a guy. It's just never the same when that bond is broken. That goes for any guy I'm dating....

And another thing, I hate guys with power trips! Please stop with that it's getting old! It's not an attractive quality at all!

I hate guys who run away cowardly with their tail between their legs, at the first sign of ""Commitment"" - My question to men is what makes it ok to have sex with girls and do everything else with them, But when it comes to doing the nice things your ""suppose"" to do, Like go out to dinner, Buying flowers, buying gifts, cards, doing thoughtful things and romantic crap like that, You just can't do it? It's tooo much for you? (Rolls Eyes) Don't you think we deserve to be treated right? I just wonder why you all do it? I hear so many stories from girls that their guys aren't doing the right things! If your gonna get yourself in trouble, have sex with, or get a girl pregnant, Be a man! Buy her a ring, do the right thing, do the romantic crap instead of being a typical male creep! (Any of my guy friends please feel free to post me a message on here to tell me why you boggle me! lol!)

"event","<B>Reason's why I shouldn't have left the house today....</B>

01. Somehow I lost $200 dollars out of my wallet.
02. I ran over a curb and scraped the bottom of my car.
03. For 2 days I tried to see my ex boyfriend and he was unavailable and blew me off. I don't know why I bother.
04. Every place I went to my credit cards were not working.
05. My storage place office closed early and I could not pay my bill.
06. I put some things in storage and forgot to put one thing in, now I have to go all the way out East again.
07. I now have no money to pay my credit card bill or buy my medication.
08. Really needed to talk to and see my 2 best friends, one was busy helping another friend, One was just about to get on a place to North Carolina.
09. There is a rabid racoon in our yard and the police are trying to catch it.
10. I have barely gotten any sleep and I feel sick.
11. I asked my ex boyfriend if I could go to his Police Academy Graduation (Because he knew I wanted to go) and he doesn't have an extra ticket for me.
12. I *currently* hate my job!
13. This has to be the unluckiest number I've ever seen lol...
14. I saw my Ex-Boyfriend Scott from High School in Best Buy and he was following me around like a lost puppy from isle to isle staring at me with his friend, He is such a moron. He kept ""trying"" to talk to me but I just ignored him and kept walking away. He's still the same idiot I use to date with his same stupid little jokes that are only funny in Scott's world. Hasen't changed. Now I know why I dumped him! HaHa! He looked horrible too & hasen't aged well. The good thing is I look good, I look young, and today you soooo realized what you lost!! 
15. I didn't get to buy anything I needed to buy today or even buy Trent's Birthday gift!
16. I am really cold and I don't want to sleep in my bed alone tonight.
17. I didn't get to go to the gym....
18. Guys think I have a sign on my forehead that says please use me and treat me like shit because I dress gothy! Well guess what, I don't!!!! I have no problem with telling guys to take a hike when they are being a jerk. It's the moron's that think their all suave and keep trying that piss me off! Can you please think with the brain in your head and not with the other head for once? And get the hint already! If your going to ask me stupid question's, Chances are you will never have a chance with me!

I was seriously about to snap today, If I didn't talk to Bill I most likely would have. And another thing where the hell is my cookie dough? Yes I'm still out 39 dollars from that!
Please shoot me now.....


<B>The only good thing's that happend today were:</B>

When I was at storage I FINALLY found my jade ring that Sonny bought me. I was so happy! And I went to Macy's and paid $20 dollar's to get the ring made to fit my ring finger! (Which originally he wanted to do.)

Jan and Trent steamed cleaned my carpets for me!(THANKYOU!)

Jan and Trent bought Pizza!

Trent made me a parking space lol!

I went to Port Jefferson to shop. Didn't buy anything but it sure did look nice for christmas!"

For those of you who ask me to explain what Goth is?
Here it is just for you :0)

<B>Defining Goth</B>
http://www.blood-dance.net/goth/origins.html

I have been working so much that my body hurts and I need rest & I cannot wait to have my bunch of days off during the holidays! (Relief!)

Ok and Claudio? (I know your reading this) You soo embarassed me at work today when you said stuff!! LOL! What were you & Kevin talking about? hehehehe! 


Watched ""Dragon - The Bruce Lee Story tonight!"" God how I LOVE this movie! This my favorite movie of all time! Hit's a nerve with me. How people get treated when they date someone a different color and how most people react to it. Boy can I relate to some scenes in the movie! Has anyone ever gotten money thrown at them while paying for your stuff in an Asian grocery store? Just because they didn't like you were a mixed couple? I'll tell you first hand it sucks! Ditto for a chinese restuarant experience my ex & I had once. Ditto for my white friends who stopped talking to me because they didn't like me dating an asian guy! Some people are really closeminded.... Good thing my mom raised me to be openminded!


No matter what I do, I still feel as if no other guy can totally replace the feelings I had for my ex. He is the only guy I can honestly say I ever loved. I still catch myself thinking of him somedays. Many days I keep myself busy and try not to think of it though. And especially now since he became a Cop I tend to worry about him more. I hate that so many guys nowadays play games. Though I moved on, I'm just tired of it... If some guy out there can replace the broken heart I have experienced, So be it. But sometime's it's hard to believe anyone can replace that stong feeling I once had with someone else. Hopefully I'm wrong? I guess I just haven't found ""him"" yet....

God this crazy Indian guy who has been stalking me most of this year still won't leave me alone! He is creeping me out and leaving me random creepy calls at 1 or 2 in the morning! Just the other day he left me another one! ""He misses me, He can't stop thinking about me"" Blah Blah Blah! How did he get my number you ask? He looked it up in my managers book of numbers without permission. This is not a guy I dated nor had any interest in. This is a guy i worked with at my extra part time job I used to have at an Indian Resturant who doesn't understand the meaning of the word no! Mind you he barely knows me. How freaky is this, he wanted to marry me a month after he met me and thought I was his girlfriend! He thinks I am his property, Is obsessed with my red hair and even gave me a gold 24 karat gold ring at work! (Which I did not take!) Because in India a man can have what he wants and the women don't really have a say. He needs to learn quickly he's in the U.S.A. now and women are not his property! Can you believe I reported this to my manager, He handled the situation, had a talk with this guy telling him not to bother me. I even quit my job there because the guy was not leaving me alone! And the guy still calls! Unreal..... My old manager called me a few time's asking me to come back, but I said no......

I got a 1882 Indian Head penny in my change! How
sweet is that? Has anyone ever found anything that old?

My friend Bev treated me to lunch because I give her rides home from work on certain days. That was soo nice of her :) Can you believe she walks home sometimes 8 miles from work because she doesen't have a car? Boy do I know how that is. On so many days where I used to work NO ONE would offer me rides at all when I didn't have a car and they'ed pass me walking to work. So I always remember to help out someone because no one remembered to help me out. (Except 2 of my friends and my family when they could- and none of them lived close by and they still helped me!)And I know how tough it is walking in the winter in the freezing cold!

I'm tired of working my ass off long hours and not being able to get overtime anymore! Ughhhhh! Funny how they decided this one right before christmas!?


I've been doing chrsitmas shopping! Weeeeee! I really do enjoy it. You know I actually put thought into my gifts. I usually try to pick something thoughtful someone might like. (Not everyone does this for instance) Last year my uncle bought me and my sisters a composition notebook & a pen (not a fancy pen just a pen!) for christmas. (Meanwhile we spent way more then 3 bucks on him!) I'm not kidding. What he does every year is he goes out & buys a whole bunch of expensive toys for himself and then he has no money left. Then he nickels and dimes all his family & friends. Ever year my friends of the family recieve tins of butter cookies and mugs from him. That's not the Christmas spirit, That is called being selfish! And my grandfather was famous for giving people tins & tins of butter cookies every year that sat in his attic from previous years because he bought them in bulk quanity lol! Did we ever eat these? No! I don't care what you get me, you can be cheap but can't you put some thought into it??? Does it have to be stale? No! It doesen't matter what I buy my dad's side of the family though, They never like it or think I'm too poor and shouldn't buy them anything lol! (I ain't rich & I ain't poor lol!) That's what christmas is for people! Giving!!!!!!! My mom raised me right, It's not right to show up empty handed. If you don't have the money fine, something small is always nice. That's why it's called Christmas. You don't have to like what I buy, but I honestly have to say I never complain about gifts unless they have no thought. I just don't get people sometimes... Christmas has always been a whole other atmosphere with my mom's side of the family & my friend's. It's always enjoyable with them. Christmas shouldn't be full of stress, or who's better then who! It should be spent having a good time with one another, enjoying each other's company, Because we're only stuck with one family, we can't pick them, So we should just make the best of it and get along!

Now for part two of my dad's family thinking my families poor lol!
The town I live in is a VERY WEALTHY TOWN. With Maids, Nannies, BMW's & The whole 9 yards! This town is $$! Mansions, regular houses, Mini Mansions, Estates, You name it. Now like I said I'm not rich & I'm not poor! But I'll tell you one thing if I was a rich as some of my EXTREMELY WEALTHY neighbor's, I'd still be mowing my own lawn, watching my own kid's, doing my own shopping no matter how much money I had. At time's I do get frusrated with people in this town because they do not fully appreciate what they have. It's funny when I meet people and they know I live in this town their first reaction is oh you must be some snobby rich chick. And then when they get to know me and find out who I really am and where I grew up, their pleasantly surprised. The other day at work we were having a discussion about how our town has a small trailor park. Odd as it may seem. We have one amongst the money. Many of us that lived here awhile had no idea. So on my way home from christmas shopping last night I decided to drive through it to check it out. For those of you that have too much $$, Just take a drive through a trailor park one day, I guarantee you, you will then learn to appreciate what you have and what some other people do not have even in a town surrounded by $$! It was like night and day. Maybe 40 homes in all, A bunch of tin cans with no yard, laundromat in the middle, Some rundown, Each trailor inches away from the nex't trailor. All cutely decorated for christmas. As you know NY isn't a trailor park kind of state, It's actually very to odd to see any at all here. So it defenitely makes you think a bit when you see them...

Recently I was talking to this kid, He has to be atleast the same age as my youngest sister. He always comes up and talks to me, He's actually like a little comedian lol! Lives nearby, Has money. He has an Indian Nanny with a brittish accent who goes with him everywhere. He told me when him & his nanny go out and buy food, they order their's first. Then on the way out they order food for his older brother. He said his brother is sooo picky that the nanny has to buy his food right before she leaves anywhere. He said if the food is not HOT enough, his brother will throw it in the nannies face when she gets home and demand her to return to get him HOT food. Which he has done many times. Must be nice to be that rich and mighty and do that to your nanny huh? It's just food man, put it in the toaster oven! (Or have your nanny do it har har har!) NOT! People are soo lazy it kill's me!"

Here is a Inspirational E-mail I got from my friend Brian recently, who I've know since I was 15 years old :) This bud of mine even took me to my prom when my ex-boyfriend Scott from High School dumped me a week before the prom (Yep my ex was an ass!)... Me & Brian go way back :0) Thanks for this great E-mail Brian! :0)

<B>""RELAXATION & HARMONY""</B>

Is there anyone who hasn't had the experience of desperately wanting something-job, money, lover or what ever, only to see it further recede the more we want it?  But if we somehow dissolve the desperation, the thing wanted the most flows to us like magic.

If a lonely man walks down the street, longing for a girlfriend or wife to cure the pain in his heart, he will burn through three pairs of shoes without easing his troubled mind.  If he can detach himself from the fear that exists beneath the longing, the fear that he is no good & incomplete, he can accept that he is ok right now and at one with all there is and ever will be.  Then he will exude a positive energy & his smile will be warmly returned up & down the block.

It is the law of the universe that what ever you put out is what you get back.  If I am open, generous & loving, I will experience life as safe, abundant and full of love.  If I am tense and fearful, & view life as dangerous and hostile, my life will reflect that fearful reality.  How could 
it not?

Are we having fun?  Or do we feel angry, jealous, lonely & guilty?  If we are in pain, we are not relaxed & we are resisting; we have blocked the flow.

Fear is the source of the blockage; it underlies your painful, negative emotions, even though its presence is usually hidden.

A woman resigns from her job.
""I liked the job but there was too much pressure, I couldn't take it."" ""What kind of pressure?"" ""They always made me feel that if I didn't perform perfectly, I'd get fired.""

She was afraid she would lose her job.  In order to placate her fear, she quit her job.  The kind of ""perfectly rational"" thing we do every day.

What else could she have done?  She could have relaxed.  Perhaps they were pressing her to do it perfectly; but perhaps, out of her own lack of self-esteem, the fear that she was not good enough, she created the pressure she could not handle.

She could have said to herself ""Since I like this job, why don't I just stop worrying about doing it perfectly & just go with it, have fun.  If they fire me, they fire me, but in the meantime I'll be doing a job I like, having fun with it, & who knows what tomorrow holds anyway?""

Fear blocks our reality of the universe by warping our perception.  It sends us guiltily into the past or anxiously into the future, rather than letting us relax in the present.

There is a Zen story about a man chased by two tigers.  Trapped at the edge of a cliff, he seizes a vine and lets himself over the side.  As he hangs on the side of the cliff he sees a tiger above him at the top.  Looking down he sees the other tiger waiting for him at the bottom.  Then two mice begin chewing through the vine from which he hangs.  At the moment with his life in the balance, he sees a wild strawberry growing out of the cliff wall beside him.  He picks the strawberry and eats it, thinking how delicious it tastes.


In a crystalline moment between life & death we can waste our short time on the vine fretting away our life, or we can let go of our fear & enjoy the 
strawberry.

What we must begin to start studying is Harmony!

The first stage of this study is the realization that we are responsible for our lack of harmony, for your own tension and fear.  Disharmony, in a person or situation does not enter our lives from without.  We create it from within.  The great illusion of disempowerment is that the crises & 
difficulties of life in themselves are responsible for our disharmony.

""A great mountain can collapse at your feet & you need not change countenance"" we are in control.  Not the ferocious attacker, not even death & dying; whether we react to those things with terror or with harmony is up to us, not them.  There is nothing that in and of itself need destroy your sense of well-being.

We can change disharmony, transform tension into relaxation, fear into joy & illness into health.  The power is in us, not in the situation or in the other person.

Harmony is itself paradise.  The ""miraculous"" element is the way that relaxation, welling being, & harmony allow your heart & mind to take control of & focus the greatness of the universe, the power of thought, & the effect that this can have in ourselves & in the world.

So the moral of this story is to - RELAX, RELAX INTO THE WORLD & RELAX INTO YOUR BEING."

<B>""Saturday Night Quotes""-</B>

Said to me by Sonny when I stayed at his house this weekend:

I really like your hair! It look's really good! 
You look really good...
You smell really good...
I missed you....
I really miss when you annoy me.... LOL!


<B>Me:</B> Yeah I told you he was a big freak! Gotta love em  lol! :0)



I stayed out East for the weekend. It was my little sister's birthday, Hung out with my bud Bill, Went to Sonny's & tonight I went to a historical candle light walk in Yaphank for the holiday's! Going to this really put's you in the christmas spirit with friend's & family :) And plus I get to see my favorite old house with the widow's peak! It is nestled in a little community of houses from the 1700/1800's with little family graveyard's near some of the houses. Nex't to the house is a river and nearby lake's. People were discussing today that they felt a prescence of Mr. Hawkin's himself haunting his home as they were decorating the house for Christmas (as well as other house's in the area.) And when you walk into these home's you feel a very strong precense that you are not alone! And I tell you if I'm ever rich, I am building myself a replica of this house and I will sit up in my widow's peak and do my artwork & painting's! (Ahhh wouldn't that be the life!) And If I become a musician I am so having a video shot here! I used to go to this house often, It was a great place to go when I was younger just to think & sit by the water fall & lake. A picturesque view of the past like this is very hard to find today in most town's :0) And walking through people's home's that were open to the public is amazing because it's so cool to see the old antiques they collect in there home's and how unique there home's are with secret passage way's & servent's quarter's! And for those of you who say to me why do you keep all this old stuff that you collect? You should just get rid of it! -  My answer to you is: There are actually people out there who are just like me, who enjoy collecting Insulator's, Old mason jars, Blue glass, Old bottle's, Antiques, Skeleton key's. And these people decorate their home's in such a great way with these thing's that I don't believe I have to get rid of any of the thing's I have been collecting over the year's! I now have sooo  many creative idea's on what I can do with them just from seeing other people's home's! I believe one day I will have a house just like the one's I've walked through today where I can display all the old thing's I've kept (Which are sentimental) and old thing's my Nana & Great Aunt have given me. I cannot wait for the day I can take all of my thing's out of storage!!

"event","Most of you don't know this but on my Scandinavian side of my family I have found out that I am part Mongolian/Chinese decent. Awhile back many scandinavians intermarried with Mongolians. Many people from these countries have a very unique look, alot of Scandinavian people look part asian and have asian features especially slanted eyes. (Which is very prominent in my family) Also many have blond hair and blue eyes. Supposively we are also related to Native Americans as well. 

I'll be honest though I miss living with my boyfriend at times. I am very used to living in an Asian household. Because I was dating my ex for such a long time, all together I've known him for a total of 15 years. I remember when I was first friends with him his mother actually liked me and was always feeding me her Laos cooking. Over the years I adapted the Asian way of living into my life and home. I take my shoes off when I enter my home, I eat with chopsticks, I would go often into Chinatown with my boyfriend to shop, I usually prefer taking herbal medicines (They work sooo much better then american one's do), I really like making different asian teas, I still like to prepare alot of asian dishes I made with my boyfriend even though I do not live with him anymore. I really do enjoy it and it is a very healthy lifestyle. I became very used to it as to my own nationalites. The way I was raised at home my mother always prepared many kinds of foods and from an early age we always had alot of asian foods in our house. I guess you could say my mom has always been very cultural. I am really glad to have grown up that way. I appreciate alot of different cultures thanks to my mom :) I also like how alot of asian families run their household. It's very neat and organized. I especially like how they are very family orientated. I really enjoy Feng Shui also, It's a very unique way of organizing your home for better living. I remember my ex boyfriend's family having the buddhist monks come into the house to bless their new homes or to have Feng Shui done. It was very interesting indeed :)"

"event","Does anyone else get bored easily? I get bored sooo easily. It's so a Gemini thing. I always need something to do. Something ""creative"" to do to keep my mind stimulated. Even as the hours pass at work I cannot get my mind off my music, going out, My Ex, My bills, Having kid's, My future or what I am planning to do. I get very restless..... Sometimes I just need to go for a long drive and think. It's nice driving out to my parent's house or to see my friend's out east, It give's me alot of thinking time on my way out there.....

Decided to put fuschia streaks in my hair tonight :) I am loving it :)

<B>Jule's is back!</B> I am free! Feelin' fine! Free of the boyfriend telling me what to do & what not to do! He was always trying to change who I was. It's very refreshing that I don't have to answer to anyone now but myself! I decided that I will be getting a tattoo soon! It will be the Chinese symbol for Jewel (My nickname) & I will most likely be putting it on my right thigh :)

Hung out with my sister, her boyfriend and the neighbors tonight. Did alittle bit of the drinky drinky & My sister made chocolate fondue which we dipped strawberries, Bananas, Pineapple, Pretzels, Pound cake, & other goodies in :) Very yummy indeed :)



<B>""Jule's Hint Of The Day:""</B>
When I wear my ""Irish Claddaugh Ring""
with he heart facing in it mean's I'm
taken (Or my heart is taken),
When I wear the heart facing
out it mean's I am NOT TAKEN
and my heart is VERY AVAILABLE! 

<B>*Just wanted to clear this up for the men out there! LOL!</B>


<B>*</B>Yes and Irish people really do LOVE potatoes, yes we do! You would be considered crazy not having atleast one Potato or a can of Guinness in your home at all time's :)

Ok people the nex't time you see me I will be one HOT MAMA! Tee-Hee! The gym is such an awesome place :) Every month there is less & less of me :) Before I went to the gym couldn't lift anything heavy - NOW - I am like Wonder Woman & can lift almost everything! Hee Hee! Do you know going to the gym is what fully helped me recover from my Pheumonia? I finally was able to breathe again and not weeze after my first month to the gym! Nice feeling indeed) :0)"

"event","Well for one thing I am a Gemini. We tend to be deep people. My friend Alan is also a Gemini & over the years me & Him have gotten into some pretty deep coversations. (Even back in High School.) I remember me & him alway's being able to connect through our poetry. (Which I keep yelling at him to write again like he used to because his stuff is REALLY good!) My outlet basically is my poetry and song writing which I have been doing since age 15. I literally have books upon books of stuff I have written. 1,000's of songs, lyric's and poetry. It's amazing how much you can accumulate over the year's! 

Well I am going to touch on a subject for a moment that most of you don't know about. This is something that happend to me last year, And I feel as if it is something I should have vented about sooner. To be honest when I moved out of my apartment last September. I was very disappointed with many of my friend's. One's who I was good friend's with, One's who I hung out with often, Even one's who were neighbor's..... I pretty much went through the hardest thing I think I have ever gone through in my life, loosing the person I loved and lived with for many years. And I can honestly say only 2 of my friend's and family were there for me. And no one else seemed to understand. It is not easy splitting up with your boyfriend of 8 year's especially since we were planning on marrying each other. Though over this year me & him have been seeing each other on & off. I can honestly say at the time I was a mess and so was Sonny. And honestly I was sooo disapointed how many of you didn't care enough to ask how I was doing or  even where I was. Especially since many of you have my E-mail and my cell number. I am constantly keeping in touch with people so I know it wasen't impossible to find me. Many of you didn't know I was very sick last year with Pheumonia (The cause of this I found out was I had and overactive thyroid/anemia problem which caused reoccuring sickness's (Like Pheumonia)I was sick from September to February with Pheumonia and thankfully got the problem under control with thyroid medication)and while I had this I had to move out my apartment in zero degree weather in the snow.(Not a fun moment I assure you) Might I add I had absolutley no car and was relying on other people to either give me ride's or pick me up from the train station. It took me 3 month's to fully move out. Going every weekend to pack up a car or two until I got it done. (Because I couldn't afford a moving van) I know people had many chances to speak to me and even saw me moving out of my apartment. But yet they said nothing to me. Thankfully from the help of my parent's, sister, her boyfriend, my friend Alan and friend Bill we got everything of mine moved into my storage place. But I can honestly say In the friend department I was royally disappointed on how many of you didn't bother with me knowing that Sansai & I had split up. Which to anyone is a big blow. How do you forgive people like that who were suppose to be your friend's? But I do thank my friend's that are out of state (Or do not live closeby/out of the country) who were there for me in spirit by E-mail or messenger. Especially Kim, Brian, Leena, Paula & Cassandra. You made my rough time's much easier by being there when many people weren't, Thankyou! :)

And another thing. One thing that get's me, People who like to gossip about people. Can you please tell me what the point of this is? What does it really prove? Does it really make you feel better sitting in a sewing circle gossiping about everyone under the sun? To me it's just a real waste of time. The people that do this dedicate there life to this and actually get off on knowing all the dirt, all the time. Does it really make you that better everyone else? To me it seems as if you have nothing else better to do with your time then to be fake and bad mouth other's. Really sadden's me how many people do this though....

She's not the kind of girl
Who likes to tell the world
About the way she feels about herself
She takes a little time
In making up her mind
She doesn't want to fight against the tide

And lately,
I'm not the only one
I say never trust anyone

Always the one who has to drag her down
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around

Can't bear to face the truth
So sick, he cannot move
And when it hurts he takes it out on you

And lately,
I'm not the only one
I say never trust anyone

Always the one who has to drag her down
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around

The trick is to keep breathing
The trick is to keep breathing

She knows the human heart
And how to read the stars
Now everything's about to fall apart

I won't be the one who's going to let you down
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around
(The trick is to keep breathing)

And I (naturally) fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye ?

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now

""You've been in the house too long"" she said
And I (naturally) fled

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die ?"

"event","You know that feeling when you feel as if your about to cave? (As in cave in for my ex again) Because at time's it is so easy to do. But I told myself I wouldn't and I am still sticking to it. Though I admit it is really hard to do. I want someone to care for me so much more then he can at the moment. I atleast owe that to myself. He may never realize what he lost, or he already does and he is so stubborn that he won't admit it. (Which knowing him as well as I do he is REALLY stubborn) Either way I lose. So there is not really much I can do but wonder to myself what's going on in his head. Why he is the way he is. And I have been living everyday to the fullest without him, which I have been doing most of the year, especially now. So there is not much difference except that I'm a much different & stronger person then I used to be a year ago and thankfully I am not in a fog anymore......"

"event","I bought myself a nice pack of clove cigarette's today :) Can't wait to smoke some :)I love how they sparkle as you smoke them & the sweet taste they leave on your lips :) I almost ran out of gas, 3 day's in a row now as I went to work, As my car's on E, Because I keep forgetting to bring my Mobil card with me. And one day I only had $2.00 on me and I made the poor full service gas man pump 2 bucks in ""My Automobile"" <---(Saying it like Long Duck Dong from 16 Candles) haha! My town love's making all their gas pump's full serve during the day, Why? I dunno! And 2 day's later my car still didn't run out of 2 bucks gas lol! It must have been running on vapors! I'd lose my head if it weren't attached honestly! I'm not even blonde! lol! I am one of those people that have really bad luck. I'm always late, my car's always breaking down, I always lose my keys, my remote, my wallet, my glasses, my chapstick lol! My alarm clock like's to die on me at the worst time's lol! Papers I put on my desk somehow get sucked into a blackhole! Same with my cd's for that matter lol! I am a really organized person too so I don't understand why I lose thing's. I sware the little people come and steal them when I'm not looking just to drive me mad! I always have a zillion thing's to do & never enough time! Got a real cool cd from my friend at work who's a dj. It's mixes of his techno :) Pretty good stuff :)I miss when my ex boyfriend & I used to paint all kind's of thing's together. On wall's, canvas', sketching etc. We were pretty artisitic & understood each other. Same understanding for art..... I miss his wicked sense of humour too. He would joke around with me and say ""Say my name, Say my name""(Like from that Destiny's Child song we'd make fun of ""Say My Name"") and I'd respond with ""I would but it's to hard to say."" Hee Hee Hee! Har Har Har! The little thing's that amuse us, lol!


I really am a Timekiller lol!
Me & time don''t get along very well!

Ha! I love flirting with my guy friend's.
Wanna know why I love it? I know them so well
I can get away with it so easily...  HaHa!



<B>PET SHOP BOYS - I Want To Wake Up</B> 
<font size=""1"" color=""white"" face=""comic sans ms"">
I heard what you said, and I can tell you it's true
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you
Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over
Think of you and shall I ever recover?

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

I stood at the kitchen-sink, my radio played
Songs like ""Tainted Love"" and ""Love Is Strange""
As I listened and the words hit my ears
I cried sudden tears

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Wake up
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

(It's mad, it's mad, it's mad)
It's mad, to be in love with someone else
When you're in love with him, she's in love with me
But you know as well as I do
I can never think of anyone but you

(All my life, 
all my life
I want to wake up)

Play with fire, play with guns
It's easy to impress someone
Turning in my sleep, you call me a fool
To fall in love, is it so uncool?

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Now, I want to wake up 
Wake up

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh

I, I want to wake up

No matter how deprived you think you are, take a step backward and really look at the situation. You'll realize you actually have it all. Now pull in that lower lip and say thank you to the universe. 

<font size=""2"" color=""black"" face=""comic sans ms"">
Hmmmm...... Thankyou to the universe, eh? lol!
Let me ponder on this a minute.... I have it all?!
I'm still deprived, No matter what it says! lol!"

<B>02.</B> You know I've dated a good amount of people, But there has only been only been one person I have ever been in love with and that was Sonny....
<B>03.</B> The one thing I have ever gotten from a boyfriend (which was from Sonny) that was really sentimental was a gold green jade ring I somehow lost, I still cannot find it & am heartbroken. Prettiest ring I ever owned.

<B>07.</B> My Ex & I are always friend's & are constantly drawn to each other, which alway's lead's us back to dating...
<B>08.</B> I love having someone to travel with. Anyone ready to travel with me to the UK & Scandinavia? I plan to get there real soon!

<B>11.</B> Most soulmate's are right under our nose & sometime's it take's year's to realize it!
<B>12.</B> I've made alot of friend's at my job. Really cool people. One in particular is my friend Wanda. Coolest manager I've ever had at any job :) I can honestly say there are 2 manager's I'd go out of my way for and she is one of them. The one's who are really cool :) On the other hand the other manager's that like to suck time out of me - very uncool!
<B>13.</B> Something people must know about me, I am good at alot of thing's but no matter what I have changed about myself I cannot change that fact that I am usually fashionably late! I've inherited my father's familie's late gene lol! Though I have gotten much better, still it is something I just cannot fully get rid of lol! So I am still working on it. Though there are many time's I have been on time, My car which is from the 1970's like's to stall on me alot! So that is also another part of my problem making me late lol! So for those of you who constantly like to remind me that I am LATE, I already know this about myself, so no need to remind me! Just accept that I will most likely be LATE at time's and just remember I really do try to get my arse there on time! :P
<B>14.</B> Ahhh! When I wake up it will be payday!
<B>15.</B> Now I know there's alot of rich people around these here part's lol! Anyone of you Billionare's want to marry a cute redhead? HeHe! I would like to live like my neighbor's across the street. Their dad is the diplomat of Cambodia. Their father bought them a $550,000 house in cash, New BMW's, Mercedes & some bright ass yellow car like Real World San Diego had haha! (Nice car, UGRY color lol! Maybe the guy's color blind & can only see bright colors lol!) They have a vacation home in France in which they spend there summer's, And apartment in NYC, A live in maid. Plus their families permanent home in Cambodia! Not bad for people in their early 20's, huh??? I hope they all appreciate what they have!!! Just for one day I'd like to have their bank account so I could pay off my credit card & medical bill's for my thyroid! And maybe buy a new car, Ok and my own house! But that's all I want! :) (Might I add the Asian guy's across the street are a real good looking and one look's like he could be Sansai's twin brother, odd! Even when the dog's see him outside they think it's him haha!)



<B>Here's something for my friend Cassandra! Tee Hee!</B>

In between sighs, you'll realize that you've made some very serious plans -- some very positive plans. Don't worry about things working out badly. You're packing just the right combination of fantasy and reality to make it all work out perfectly."

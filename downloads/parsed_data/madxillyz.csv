it has come to my attention long ago that several people do not like me/have issues with me for reasons unknown to me

the few things I can think of that could possibly have made these individuals mad are such petty situations that I would believe that they would overlook or ignore

however, appearently I have wronged several people greatly and I feel that I should at least be informed of what a heinous crime I have committed against them


any comments left on this post WILL be screened first so you can inform me of my problems without starting an internet war

however, I do feel if you feel you have the indecentcy to attack me on previous posts for me not doing anything you should at least have the decentcy to inform me of what it is you feel I have done wrong"

I'm not sure what I've said to certain people to piss them off but appearently I did a good job of it some how

I WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY POST MADE ON THIS IN THAT I'M NOT GOING TO CHECK IT AGAIN AND HAVE TURNED OFF THE EMAIL THING


Kim...at one point in time i did like you so regardless of what you have heard I did over the summer....and if it wasn't for your age I would have went out with you....everyone tells you that you act so old but I personally don't see it....you act your age...and it bothered me and that is the only reason I never asked you out....your still naive enough to believe that doing shit will make you cool....your too worried about what people think of you and you act like a hardass....I'm not trying to piss you off and don't want to fight with you this is it it's done no more drama...your happy, I'm happy lets leave each other alone...I don't care what you do or who you hang out with....so if your trying to get to me it's not working...I am moving past shit and so should you....do something you like doing...prove me wrong and just be more mature than your age...leave shit be....I don't know what your being told but remember who your being told this all by....all i have to say...your being told all this by people that dislike me for one and people that have done some fucked up shit to me in the past as well.....

by all means i'm only trying to get things how they should be....forgotten....so all I ask is that everyone does the same...goodbye"

"event","Well this week has been a little awkward

Monday school then worked
Tuesday school then hung out with michelle  Changed my oil then went to her granny's and hung out
Wednesday school then to the shop to fix my plates on my struts, the pins, and muffler

Today school, then work

I'd kind of like to talk about the Eric Schorling event a little and although I was not a friend of his and hardly knew him (for those of you that don't know Michelle was a good friend of his) I think that a lot of people are judging without knowing fully....I don't know hardly anything about him I admit that right now...however by reading the paper or articles, or talking to nicoles friends all your going to get is her side....and like any situation there is always another side.  I am in no way saying that what he did was right...and I do agree that no one deserves to be stabbed however I do feel he was egged on by her to an extreme extent and that people should really watch they're fucking mouths about what they say about him.  I have read numerous things saying ""fuck him I hope he's ass raped or dies"" but personally anyone that says that is childish and incompetent if they are not willing to find out what he was going through and what his life was like.  Granted I disapprove of his actions and feel they were a very poor decision I still feel that people at least owe him enough to find out something before jumping to conclusions.  I don't feel he should be inprissioned for the rest of his life...however I do feel he needs a punishment not to be decided by biased sympathizers of her friends but by a jury.  So all of you people that are judging him based solely on what you heard of him or by how you stereotype him you should feel like shit and I hope you burn in hell also for ""judging thy neighbor"" and passing unjust judgement.  I have met Eric once in my life and upon meeting him I wanted to unfairly assume that I would dislike him cause me and Michelle's friends have been known to not get along but upon meeting him I thought he was a cool and alright guy and he is the only male friend (that I have met) that I approved of and got along with.  He may have been wrong in his actions but people make mistakes.  It's not fair of you to say you hope he burns in hell cause he made a mistake....we'll all hope you burn in hell next time you make one."

She sits in the cormer,
They've never heard her speak.
Yet still they throw her insults,
Because they know she is weak.
She once was like them,
She once knew how to smile.
She can't remember how to laugh,
After all, its been awhile.
All the pain has killed her,
And all that remains is a shell.
She has too many secrets,
None of which she can tell.

"event","Why cant the people that hate me just be bitches to my face instead of doing it behind my back. It is really starting to annoy me. 
I put a cigarette out on my leg tonight... not sure why but it hurt like fuck. Ches and Dave split up... and then magical me waved my fairy wand and returned them to happiness. 
Im good at fixing other people's problems i just cant fix my own. oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo... i get to see dixon tomorrow until it is time for drama. I am kinda, sorta, a lot worried. He just broke up with Tasha and they had been together for ages... i am wooried cos i know that they will probably eventually get back together and i will be left standing there watchin in on everybody else's happiness.
I have another big fucking red mark on my face... i should stop 'walking into doors' so much.
I just realised that this is my first post cos ches did the other ones... Go me!!!!!!!!

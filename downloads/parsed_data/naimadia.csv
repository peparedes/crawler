"event","I wish I knew why I feel so depressed recently.  I feel so drained and I'm not sleeping well and everything irritates me.  I've felt this way for so long that I don't remember a time when I didn't feel like this.  I've cried or felt like crying almost everyday this week.  I even cried at work yesterday.  My boss was worried about me because I'd missed two days of work, which is really unusual for me, so she asked me how I was doing.  And I started to cry.  She was very understanding and told me I could take time off if I wanted just to have a break.  I felt a little better after that because I was worried she was upset with me for missing work.  And poor Brandon... I don't know how he's been able to stand me... I can barely stand myself.  Well, I think that's enough whining for now."

"event","My dad took me to a movie and then pizza today.  We saw T3... it was actually a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  He also got me a neat little carved wood stool that he bought in the Philippines.  I don't see my dad often and I don't really like spending time with him when he is around because all he does is bitch about everything... but today he was almost nice and I actually enjoyed seeing him.   I also FINALLY got a screen for my window... yay!!!!! ... now I can get a breeze going through my room without worrying about being attacked by the wasps that live outside my window."

"event","Happy Birthday to me!  I had a pretty good day overall.  I went to lunch with my mom (yummy, yummy thai food).  Brandon gave me a beautiful, sparkly necklace.  And I love it.  I did have to take an evil history test though.  I think the teacher was flirting with me during the test... kinda scary.  Anyways... and yes I do love the necklace in case you missed it the first time... or the second... third... =P"

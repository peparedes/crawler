"event","Many of my transsexual friends of recent have expressed at least a passing desire to kill themselves. Thankfully, this hasn't come to pass. Some of these friends are post-operative and some are in transition. Different stages of the path, with different motivations for each.

Generally, thoughts of suicide for me are rare. And, usually, they stem from just a general ennui about absolutely everything rather than something TS-related. Even then, I don't want to kill myself; it's just the easiest possible solution to make <i>all</i> my problems go away at once. Downside is that I don't get to be around to enjoy the benefits of having those problems absent, but hey, when you're really beat down it often sounds like the best solution.

TS-related problems sometimes, even after what appears to be a successful transition and a pretty good SRS, hit me on occasion. I honestly don't personally know of any transsexual individual this doesn't happen to. In most transsexual biography, after surgery and transition life appears to be all flowers and roses and for many of us who used those biographies as the roadmaps to follow, I think we buy into the idea that all of our problems will be over once we declare our transitions finished. 

<i>My hands are still too big. My face has problems. My voice slips. My hips aren't curvy enough. I need bigger breasts. I don't think my genitals look natural. Dilating reminds me of how much of a woman I'm not. Someone suspects at work and I know they are looking at me funny. I get stared at in restaurants, do I look good or am I being clocked?</i>

Those are the kinds of thoughts that still, post-transition, linger in our minds and sometimes become outright obsessions. Don't kid yourself - you're probably going to have one, some, or all of them after you think you're finished. Whether or not there is any truth to those thoughts I can't answer; it's all on individual basis but in many instances it's likely just paranoia. I can't tell you how attractive you are or how well you vibe.

The most important thing you should remember is that having these feelings doesn't automatically invalidate your transition or make you a failure. What it probably means is that while you've accomplished an incredible transformation, it's not the transformation that you really desire. And that transformation isn't medically possible yet. Sometimes you just got to suck it up, and other times, you need to lean on the friends you can trust these feelings with.

For me, my big ""thought"" is that I really, and I mean <i>really</i>, want a working reproductive system. I know that two or three cycles and cramps and mood swings in I might say otherwise, but I want the real thing and want to experience how the real thing feels when having a full-on wild and intense fuck, and I also want the quiet reassurance that I don't have to spend any time with Mr. Stent.  Sometimes it gets to me that I won't know what that is like in my lifetime. I mean, who knows, it could happen, but it's not likely. And no amount of successful surgery or transition can alleviate that from my psyche. 

By no means am I trying to belittle those of us who have legitimate problems. Families sometimes never accept us. Sometimes we don't pass and can't afford FFS or plastic surgery to improve our chances of doing so. Often, people get confrontational and violent with us. Our situation does give us a lot of crap to deal with and sometimes we can't solve it all. 

Sometimes, though, we obsess on things we shouldn't be, pine for more than we can have, worry about things that needn't be worried over, and we allow these three things to consume us and rule us to the point where we believe the only way to eliminate them is to eliminate everything else, too."

"event","Jenny Boylan and her wife were on CNN tonight. This got me thinking about all the times in my life I've seen transsexual people on TV in venues that were not <I>Jerry Springer</I> or anything in that vein, beginning with Caroline Cossey. My opinions on this have changed as I have gone through my transition.

PRE-TRANSTION - ""Oh god, please, please, tell me something to help me get started or get this done.""

In the beginning, I was desperate for any kind of practical advice. These women were goddesses at the time, those who had been to the mountain and returned and I wanted to partake so badly of whatever wisdom could be granted.

TRANSITION - ""You lucky, lucky, bitch. I hate your fucking guts.""

Okay, not quite true. But during transition I was so envious and jealous of those who had made it. Completion seemed so far away and unattainable, that it barely seemed real that successful transitions could occur. Left by myself with my own plateaus and obstacles, all I could feel was envy.

POST-TRANSITION - ""Oh god, please, please, don't fuck this up for the rest of us.""

Currently, I'm just hoping that we're presented positively and with dignity. Which most of us who do shows of this nature tend to do. I'm less convinced by documentaries, but my overwhelming feeling lately watching TS women on television is that I'm acutely aware that they are, for better or for worse, representing me in the public eye and I'm hoping with all my little desire to be as un-persecuted as possible heart that minds will open and not close as a result of that representation."

My own words, last entry into this journal.

I've found many way of reiterating this point, almost to the degree of being a broken record (or skipping CD). I had planned on moving on to a new topic. 

However, I feel I need to make certain I clarify something in the above quote before I do.

When I say transition is often a life-long goal, I mean that because of circumstance, such as finances, it can take several years to complete, not that you will struggle throughout your entire life with it.

And when I say transition is a life-defining goal, I mean that it is a pivotal moment in one's life in which your life changes.

It is not, nor should it be considered, the goal of one's life. Or, to be blunt about this, transition should be a means to live life.

Take this as you will."

"event","I had a lot of varying ideas I've been wanting to write about recently, but a conversation with a fellow Transsexual Jedi brings this to the fore of my mind and thus I now share it with you.

What do you do after transition? Forgetting the stealth or not to stealth dilemma, the very real question of what do you do with yourself after all is said and done is one many of us aren't prepared for.

We invest an <I>enormous</i> amount of energy into transition. Our mental, physical, and spiritual energy is at times completely devoted to it. This often amounts to years worth of time, though some of us go through it relatively quickly. For some of us, it is a lifelong goal that takes several years to see to fruition and like any other life-defining goal, once the burden of completing it has been lifted many of us become lost.

In my opinion, transition is an <i>exciting</i> time in the life of a transsexual individual. Yes, the downside of it still remains, but co-existing with the arguments, depression, and impatience we also have the thrill of being called ""ma'am"" for the first few times (""sir"" for our FtM brothers), the wonder at having HRT transform us, the change in attitude and outlook as the problems stemming from TS/GID fade one by one, the absolute wonder and joy and discovering how your new body works, and any number of little achievements and pleasures that accompany our changes. Transition is, for lack of a better word, <I>exciting</i>, because change is happening. An astounding and awe-inspiring time of change, even if it doesn't seem that way while it is occurring.

Most of us will never admit this, especially with how popular the autogynephelia theory has become among some people in the medical community (and some in our community as well), but being a transsexual can make you an exotic creature. Especially when you are pre-op. You're in the midst of this incredible metamorphosis, crossing the sexual binary to the other side of the genital fence, physically neither fully female nor fully male, and yet a little bit of both. Coupled with the fact that many of us have a very visible spark of life that is burning brilliantly as our transition progresses, inching ever closer to completion, it's an amazing time to be alive. 

And yet, at the same time, we are so waiting to be past it, to finish transition and live a normal life that we don't recognize how much energy we devote to it. While undergoing transition the goal is get to get past it and to be no longer transitioning. Once it gets there, however, once it's over, what do you after that? A lot of us reach the end of transition and a few years later begin questioning why we went through it at all? Was it worth it? Are the benefits worth what we sacrificed and endured to get there? Sometimes, the end seems so far away that it might never appear, and when you finally reach it you're unprepared for the truth that awaits you at the end.

And that truth is simply, life continues.

Life continues except now you will be living it from a woman's perspective, and life as a woman does not guarantee happiness. As I said in a previous entry, we initially believe that all we desire is to be an ""ordinary"" woman living an ""ordinary"" life. Some of us are unprepared  for the fact that ordinary life as a woman is no better, in fact can be worse, than ordinary life as man (with the reverse also being true for FtM's). The amazing transformation, once over, loses its magic and is slowly forgotten in day-to-day life. No longer are you working towards a massive end, and no longer are you obtaining little victories along the way. All you have remaining is normal, day-to-day life.

When you are transitioning, this day-to-day life might as well be our Holy Grail. We are convinced, utterly, that that ordinary life in our correct physical sex will be enough to content us and all the hell we went through to obtain it will be worth enduring to get there. And certainly for many of us that indeed is enough. For others, and for various reasons, we are left with a sense of emptiness after crossing the finishing line. I have come to understand in my experiences that when you're transitioning, words of caution given to you by those whose transition are over often fall on deaf ears. Either we blindly ignore it, so convinced that it will be different for us, or we listen to it and are still unprepared for it when we reach the end ourselves.  

For many of us, we might also/instead wonder if life is actually better after transition. Is life as a post-transition woman better than life a pre-transition or transitioning woman? For those of us whose transition is relatively painless, transition very early and/or find it easy to ""pass"" from the get-go, I've been told this is apparently a common situation. If nothing has fundamentally changed from the before and after transition besides your body and life continues much the same as it did before except now you're the opposite sex, was the change itself enough to make you happy? I don't know if it's possible to really ask yourself these questions during transition itself, when GID/transsexualism can have moments so insurmountable and unforgiving that all we can think of being rid of it, even if those moments are only our own frustration at not being through transition. 

Regardless, a point in time will come when day-to-day life, with all its ups and downs, in your new body is all you have left to look forward to, with that new body soon becoming nothing more than your body, and then your old body. At the finish line of transition is nothing more than that.  For most of us, we're not going to be glamorous, or beautiful, or sexy. We're going to be the women (and men for FtM's) at the grocery store, the ones in the cubicle next to you at work, the ones that serve you food at a restaurant or whom wait in line in front of you at the bookstore. 

Ordinary women living ordinary lives. Don't expect to gain anything more from transitioning than that.

To borrow a phrase from a friend, that's prize and the <i>penalty</i> that awaits you when you get there."

Common thought for us MtF's. The going thought being that if only I had the right body, it didn't matter what I was doing with it. Just being free of the nasty shackles of the Y-Chromosome would be enough. If only I could be an unremarkable, plain, woman.

Take my word for it right now, that's a fool's bet. Or, to be slightly more blunt.

Bull. Shit.

Perhaps this is merely a matter of personality, but I can't think of anything more terrifying. You see these women all the time at work, or at the grocery. Distant, unhappy eyes. Whatever beauty they possessed crushed or wrung out of them by lethargy and anger. Their overheard conversations revealing resentment, perhaps frustration and hope forgotten. 

Is that really who you want to be? Is that all you aspire to?

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that simply being a woman will make everything better. It doesn't. 

Please, I beg of you, take this message seriously.

Don't strive to be nothing more than an ordinary woman.

Be an <B>extraordinary</B> one."

"event","Let's put all the BS aside for a moment. All the ""I'm a woman/man trapped in a man's/woman's body"" musing and all the ""I have a female/male soul stuck in the wrong flesh"" poetry.

If you strip all our romantic notions away and look at transsexualism as strictly a medical condition, one that not only deserves to be treated by the medical community but in fact needs to be treated by them, we should examine where the future of this leads.

It's not to better SRS, or organ transplants, or grown sexual organs from our own tissues that will replace the ones incongruent to our identity, but instead to eliminating transsexualism altogether. You know, making the mind congruent with the body, and not vice versa.

As it stands now, we undergo some pretty radical procedures to put align that which is unaligned. Imagine a different world, where instead you'd take a single little pill and poof, your transsexualism vanishes and you're free to live on as a member of your biological sex. No need for hormone therapy or surgery, no need for science-fiction tissue generation which would require painstaking hours of attaching to the proper blood vessels and nerve clusters. No weeks and months or years even of transition. No electrolysis or lasering of undesirable hair. Just a single little cure-all and everything is right with the world.

Post this scenario to most transsexuals, and most them will answer with ""No way in hell. I'd never be happy as (insert birth sex here). I am (insert GID sex here).""

Well, if we accept that this is a biological condition, we also must accept that biologically speaking, most of our physical body is just fine. Some of us, of course, are born XXY or intersexed and different treatments would develop for that, but for those of us who have otherwise normal bodies, the only thing truly out of whack is that little part of your brain that is saying FEMALE where it should say MALE. 

Occam's razor here: all things being equal, is it easier to completely transform a body to match a single part of the mind, or easier to change a single part of the mind to match the entire body? 

The medical community of the future is likely to take this approach towards treating transsexualism in the future when/if transsexualism is accepted into the community as a biological condition rather than a psychological disorder. Which, referencing one of my earlier entries, is likely why we rarely see anything about transgendered individuals in sci-fi. Transsexualism has simply been eliminated. People are no longer born TS, or when it is caught early in infancy by advanced testing, it is corrected on the spot and never becomes an  issue.

Of course, nature being what it is, we can also predict a whole new host of GID/TS related people arising specifically from that kind of treatment, same as we can with custom-genetics for conception and any other designer-type construction of the human condition. 

While, like most transsexuals, I bristle at the thought of such a future, there are times I have to concede that the merits of such a treatment are astounding. I look back at my transition with rose-tinted glasses now that I am through with it, but at times it was the most horrible thing I could imagine someone going through and pre-transition, if someone offered me a quick fix to the problem over a lengthy and painful one...it would have been tempting.

I'm torn by the acceptance of transsexualism as strictly a biological condition for this reason, really. Especially if we explore the idea that the transsexual occupies a particular niche in both the sexual and the magickal facets of human society, one that needs to be there for balance and in which the absence of it would have unpredictable consequences on the species. I don't know. That's a topic for another day, though. 

For me, as much as I'm longing for true female anatomy and a normal woman's body, I'm happy that I'm living in a time where I can receive a facsimile of it, rather than a little pill that would kill the girl I am off altogether."

"event","I haven't written in this journal for over a month now. Which ties in nicely to this entry. The point of this journal was to give me an outlet to speak out on transsexual issues or topics that I wouldn't normally speak of. That's the goal of living stealth, after all. And recently, I haven't had anything I really wanted to talk about.

Life goes on, you see. We are transsexual, perhaps inescapably, but this doesn't define our existence. Transsexual is a word that describes some of the events of my life, but not my life in its entirety. Time passes where I don't dwell on the fact that I am one of the people in the world that had a sex-change, rather I'm just yet another person living in the world. 

Does that make me a successfully ""stealth"" woman? Would life have to throw my transsexualism back in my face at least once a day to make me unsuccessful? I don't know, and nor do I care. The goal of transition is to reach a point where you can move past things TS, or at least that's what most transsexuals I know of wish for. 

I'm finding that while I have moved past most things TS, I very much enjoy visiting them on occasion. I enjoy speaking with other Transsexual Jedi as they continue their own journeys. It's wonderful to hear about victories: the moment HRT begins, going fulltime, scheduling SRS, etc. Sure, it's also sad to hear about the downside: vitriolic family and friends, getting clocked, the long delay transition goals sometimes endure, etc.

We are a rare breed, after all. It may not seem that way, especially if you are so immersed in things TS that it is all you see. If your life currently consists of several support groups, both IRL and online, boards and lists that you post and read, and so much of your energy is devoted to the cause so to speak, you can miss this.

Meeting with some other T-Jedi recently made me smile, looking at their strength and the brightness of their eyes, and even crying with them in pain. What a life they are leading right now! To think that I was there once, doing the same thing. How absolutely amazing that anyone goes through this at all! Look at them, how they shine, how beautiful they are, like brilliant stars amid an ocean of blackness! Do I shine as bright as they do?

It's ironic that the goal of transition is to leave that state behind entirely. While I'm glad that I've moved past it (which is evidenced by how much I'm not dwelling on the fact that going through transition is quite possibly the most agonizing thing we'll ever do), I'm grateful I haven't forgotten it.

It's balance, for me at least, that's required. Not letting it consume or define you, but also not forgetting (or ignoring) that it happened."

"event","Reason number two why SRS was worth it to me:

I can orgasm without touching myself. This is so indescribably wonderful that I think it might be hard to really conceive of it pre-surgery. I know that I wouldn't have been able to wrap my thoughts around it back then. I didn't know that this was going to be possible pre-surgery, mind you, and for an agonizing span of about 3 months after surgery I didn't know if I'd be able to orgasm at all. 

In a male body, orgasm required a significant amount of fantasy with an equal amount of physical stimulation. When I began HRT, any sexual release often required significant effort unless I was excited beyond the normal realms of arousal, and that happened very few times.

Now, however, in a female body, it still requires a significant amount of fantasy, but simply clenching my muscles will produce some mind-blowing results. In fact, this method of doing it has actually become preferable to any other sort of self-fun. Which of course means I need to get some new toys.

This has lead me to do some really odd things, such as doing it at work just because I can. Really drives home the differences between having girl parts and not having girl parts."

"event","Once you complete your transition, you are faced with an incredible question: to live stealth or not to live stealth? For my non-TS readers, stealth is the term the TS community has assigned to living a new life in your new physical sex without anyone knowing about your past.

For many of us, stealth is what is desired. We long for it and dream about it but don't think we'll ever really reach it, mostly because of how we look. For most of us, all the hormones and surgeries and adjustments we make still aren't enough to completely eradicate what was once a masculine body. Further, there are always people in your life who know about your past, ergo, family and friends, and while they don't mean to slip up, sometimes they do. Then there is the dreaded paper trail: yearbooks from school, legal documents tracing your changes of name and sex, etc. Somewhere out there is something that can nail you.

I live a stealth life for the most part. I have friends who know and family who definitely know. But I don't advertise being TS, and it's been a few years since anyone actually came up and asked me what sex I am. But there is still part of me that doesn't want to be stealth at all.

It's not just about relationships with lovers, it's about relationships with everyone. When someone believes you to be just another girl, this fits you neatly into a nice pocket of reality that is easily defined and accepted. But once the same someone learns you a transsexual girl, you no longer fit there. You're that girl that used to be a guy, or that guy that used to be a girl for our FtM brothers. In Pat Califia's book <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573440728/qid=1089824644/sr=1-18/ref=sr_1_18/002-4573786-4400815?v=glance&s=books"">Sex Changes</A>, she writes:

<I>Recently, I had a very educational experience. I found out that one of my long-term women acquaintances is transgendered. I had known this person for several years without being aware of that. I was pained by this discovery, since I like to think that my ""trans-radar"" works as well as my ""gaydar."" She hadn't intended to deceive me, she thought I already knew. <B>Given how much work I've done to educate myself about transsexuality, I didn't think it would make that much of a difference. But I found myself looking at her in a whole different way. Suddenly, her hands looked too big, there was something odd about her nose, and didn't she have an Adam's Apple? And wasn't she awfully bossy, just like a man? And my god, she had a lot of hair on her forearms.</B>

...Transphobia is very difficult to eliminate. <B>Those of us who are not transgendered can hardly ever be trusted to make accurate judgments about transsexuals because we don't see them the same way we see each other. We use another set of standards to evaluate them. And those standards are biased, towards uncovering evidence that their chromosomal sex is still affecting their self-presentation, among other things.</B></I>

That pretty much sums everything up, much as I am loathe to depend on another writer to make my points. Most of us live stealth lives to avoid having that same scrutiny placed upon us and to eliminate the dynamics of our friendships changing. 

It is not easy to gloss over 19 years of life that wasn't lived as a female, to subtlely rearrange words in your memory to fit your new life. ""What kind of activities did you do in high school?"" Well, I can mention literary club. That's nice and safe. I can't mention any of the sports I was involved in since girls weren't allowed to play them at my school, and even if they were, it becomes a bigger story to fashion what it was like to be a girl who wrestled, for example.  I can bounce lightly upon my drama experience, because on the off chance someone asks me what plays I was in and recognizes them, they might ask me what role I was cast in. Save for lying, there's not a good way out of that.

I don't like lying. For the time being, I'm okay with just omitting details that would spawn further questioning, but I'm still bitter that I must do it. It's naive of me to believe it, but I would love to exist in a world where being transsexual did not carry a stigma.

Like I mentioned at the beginning of this collection of writing, I feel that the life of a transsexual has some absolutely amazing and beautiful moments that non-transsexual members of our world might like to know about. <A HREF=""http://www.scarletletters.com/current/air.html"">Raven Kaldera</A> has written some interesting pieces about the transsexual individual often being left out of gender studies, though we probably have insight into the situation that few other people do. That's just for starters, of course.

As far I know, I'm the only person to come out of my high school knowing both what it is like to change naked as a male in the company of men and as a female in the company of women. I've gone to cities as a pre-teen boy and returned there as an adult woman. I've read books pre-HRT full of testosterone and post-HRT full of estrogen and had two different perspectives on the story as a result. I've experienced both the weird insecurity of phallus size, and understood intimately from vaginal penetration that yes, size can make a difference. 

At times, I'd love to share these experiences and insights with the world. The appeal of baring all and hiding nothing is extremely alluring, almost exotic in nature. The want and desire of being this openly transformed and sexual being who dared to cross a forbidden boundary is intoxicating, and I am often envious of those brave enough to do it.

Most of the time, I realize that the world doesn't want to hear them...yet. The number of transsexuals killed every year once they are outed by horrified lovers or casual transphobics, are enough to frighten me into silence, save for the safe anonymity of this medium. 

Still, we've come along way in terms of acceptance of transsexualism and one day it might be different. For the time being, I will write about it in the hopes that someone actually wants to listen."

"event","There are endless theories and hypothesis about transsexualism, particularly within the transsexual community itself.

I'm no different, and from time to time I will probably share some of these with you.

With that, I present to you the first Law of the Transsexual Jedi Code.

<B>1: A Transsexual Jedi shall not overcompensate in an attempt to appear more feminine to other Transsexual Jedi. </B>

You know the type. The ones that have to emphasize how high they scored in the feminine range of any gender test, particularly online ones. The ones who scream with righteous indignation at anything remotely resembling female discrimination or persecution. The ones who say things like ""only a man would find that funny"" after hearing a joke, despite that fact that some GG women are laughing along with it. The ones who are so vile and condemning of all things male and masculine, bashing and trashing absolutely everything they see, to the extreme degree that they end up alienating our FtM kindred who shouldn't have to put up with that kind of venom in supportive environments such as online TS forums. The people who say with firm belief <I>this</I> is female and this is <I>not</I> with no room the area male and female share together.

It's something I've noticed in the time I've been in the online TS community. I don't know if this is an issue of self-esteem, of being afraid of not seeming feminine enough. Or maybe it's needing to be in the spotlight, some kind of ""top dog"" syndrome where they have to be the Alpha female now.

Quite honestly, I understand that some of us have issues and self-hatred, particularly in the pre-operative phases of our lives. But it sickens me that a lot of MtF's are not compassionate and understanding to our FtM brothers who are trying so desperately to get on the side of the fence that is being brutalized by the MtF's.

I don't know if the same things happen in forums dominated by FtM's, or the same law above applies to FtM's trying to appear overly masculine, so if I have any FtM's reading this, please let me know your opinion on this.

I'm going to expound on some of these thoughts soon, but for now, all I can say is this:

Don't be one of those people. You know who you are."

"event","Transsexualism is a very poorly misunderstood condition. We're often thought of being gay men/women who change their physical sex to better bed members of the same sex, and more frighteningly, so we can bed straight members of that sex. Or people believe that as children we were raised improperly in some wacked out fashion or other, sufficiently so that we're messed up enough to believe that changing sex is the excuse we've come up with to make the hell of our childhood trauma vanish. Parents often believe that they've failed to raise a TS child properly, that they didn't encourage or forbid the right gender behaviors and the fact that their child desires to change sex is their fault. The list goes on and on.

Here's the truth, in so far as science can tell us. The sizes of an area of the brain known as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is different for men and women. The size of this area is independent of sexual orientation. Gay women and straight women have the same sized area, and the same goes for gay and straight men. It is also free of influence from hormone replacement therapy during adulthood. To quote the source, <B>The BST plays an essential role in masculine sexual behaviour and in the regulation of gonadotrophin release...our demonstration of a sexually dimorphic pattern in the size of the human BSTc, which is in agreement with the previously described sex difference...indicates that this nucleus may also be involved in human sexual or reproductive functions. </B> To read the full report, click <A HREF=""http://www.symposion.com/ijt/ijtc0106.htm"" TARGET=_blank>here.</A>

Now, this is fascinating part, and apologies to all you FtM's out there because this study didn't examine your side of this, but the size of the BST in all male-to-female transsexuals this study examined is within the size it should be for a woman. Since it isn't altered by sexual orientation, or by the use of hormones later in life, the study is stating that part of our brains is female and is telling us we are female on a fundamental level.

Biological...think a moment and let that sink in for my non-TS readers. It's inside you on a level that cannot be reversed by chemicals or psychotherapy. This very basic part of your mind responsible for your sexual identity is basically wired up to be a different sex than what your body is. Can you begin to conceive of how devastating this is? You can try deceiving yourself, you can try denying it and suppressing it, but you <I>cannot</I> do it. Parts of your brain are wired up to tell you how to act and feel in a manner contradictory to the body its housed in. In other words, there's no choice in this. We don't choose to be transsexual. It's part of who we are, inexorably.

Can you do that? Can you comprehend knowing that you are one sex but having the body of another? You can't, unless you are transsexual. People say that they can't understand us, and that's true. You can't. It's not given to you to understand it because your brain and body are in proper alignment. All our words and prose and poetry and songs might give you a glimmer of the pain we feel, our angst and anguish, but it's not possible for you to really know. I'm not trying to be elitist here, just trying to be truthful. The same argument applies to me understanding what it is like to be, say, blind from birth, having never known color or light. I can do my best to imagine it, but despite my efforts I cannot know what that was like. Even being struck blind later in life isn't the same, as I would remember color and light, perhaps even long for it and mourn its absence. It's just a frame of reference I am not able to experience.

Can you imagine going through puberty with this conflict? The fundamental force of will needed to ignore what the core of your identity is telling you? If it's not enough that we have this to deal with, often as a result our mental and social problems just compound and multiply as we try to deal with this in ways that cannot help, are tormented and disciplined for exhibiting behaviors or thoughts which are normal for the mind we possess, etc. Transsexualism is a big enough conundrum to try to deal with, but given how it manifests, it often leads to other trauma and other problems.

Take all of this, this confusion and all its accompanying baggage, and then examine what we have to do to have our bodies match our minds. Indescribable humiliation and embarrassment as you begin your transition to a female(male) life, looking like some bastardization of androgyny gone wrong; doubts and arguments and possible estrangement from friends and family who repeatedly tell you that you are wrong, that you're making a mistake, that you'll regret it later, that they've known you for X years and they know you're male(female) and you're just making all this up for some unknown reason; changing your body via hormones that may or may not damage your liver or give you exotic cancers some untold time down the line; hair removal that despite any advertisements to the contrary is painful and time-consuming; fighting the legal system to have your identification changed from your prior sex to your new sex and dealing with the reality that most anti-discrimination law doesn't cover transsexualism; having to relearn how you speak, both in terms of tone, pitch, diction, vocabulary, and pace because everything you've been socialized as acceptable as a male(female) is not necessarily that way for females(males); the awkwardness of learning how to be a woman(male) in the company of women(men), because despite what you think or have been told you're not going to fit right in like a long-lost puzzle piece; living full time as a member of that other sex before you're allowed to have surgery because you have to prove that you can ""do"" it, always with the nagging feeling in the back of your head that someone is going to challenge you, that things might get violent, and you'll end up just like Brandon Teena did, and finally, undergoing a surgery that cannot be reversed, requires significant maintenance after it is completed, and taking the chance that if it is botched it's going to leave you even more a wreck than you were before.

Yeah, this is something we <I>choose</I> to go through. We <I>want</I> to deal with this. It's <I>fun</I>. It's <I>exciting</I> and <I>sexy</I> to us.

Most of us wouldn't wish transsexualism on our worst enemy, much less want to go through it ourselves."

"event","For some transsexuals, there is a time that occurs between accepting that you're TS and the time you decide you have to take steps to correct matters, ergo transitioning. It's a significant difference and a lot of crazy things can happen during that time.

Some people, cognizant of the fact that they are TS, will still marry and have children. I cannot and do not understand why they do it. It's hard enough on the parents and siblings you already possesses, but once you marry and have children you're life is no longer your own. You have made a commitment to another, who unless he/she knew that you were TS ahead of time, is going have their world shatter in devastating fashion when you finally decide you can't handle it any longer. You also have created life which is dependant upon you and whom you are responsible for. Even if they are somehow able to accept you changing sex, the conflict with you and spouse will still affect them. If it doesn't, you're lucky. Extremely lucky.

I've been told many reasons why transsexuals marry and don't tell their spouses their feelings. Most of them tend to do with ""putting myself into a situation where I had be this way,"" or ""I thought if I married and had kids it would cure me or I wouldn't be able to think about it."" 

Sorry to burst your bubble, but it needs to be burst. You're never going to be free of it. It's going to haunt you until you can't not think about it, eat at you alive until you're willing to sacrifice all the time and energy you put into that family just to be whole. Your brain is hardwired to be a gender opposite of your body and no amount of therapy or delusions is going to change this fact. (more on that in a later entry)

You cannot squelch it indefinitely. It will get you. Even if you're able to resist the call to transition, you're going to be miserable, surrounded by artifacts, roles, rituals, and rites that are an endless reminder each day that you're living a half-life. To this day, I know only one person who refuses to transition, and that is because she feels she will not ""pass"" and that she is too old to try. She's attempting to live life without it, but I know she's unhappy and desperately wishes for someway of changing it.

Some will tell me that ""my spouse knew what I was when we got married."" Well, I hate to burst that bubble too, but most people will say they're okay with it until the time comes to transition. Suddenly, they have to rebuild their mental image of you, watch your body undergo a startling metamorphosis and watch as you become something else. It's difficult to watch this, to endure it as an observer, unless they are desiring the change to happen with you. This is compounded the longer transition takes to occur. They get used to perceiving you one way, and then have to completely re-adjust things to accommodate your new self. All cards are thrown out the window if you have kids in the intervening time.

This isn't even getting to the area where you tell a potential spouse that you are TS, and they simply can't believe that you're ever going to do it. Oh, they'll tell you they know, that they understand, but most of them will not deal well when the time comes. People will believe what they want, they will delude themselves to believe whatever they need to. Especially when they're in love. 

Sexual preference has such a big part to play in this. People don't fall in love with people most of the time, unless they've got some degree of bisexuality. They fall in love with a person of a specific sex. I'm going to use the male-to-female example here, since it is the most prevelent in this circumstance. Hetero women fall in love with hetero men, and if the man they fall in love with one day says ""I'm actually a woman,"" you have to expect an appropriate amount of shock. Not only does this woman have to cope with their spouse changing sex, they have to question a great deal about themselves. A woman who thinks she's bisexual and stays with you during your transition might be surprised to find out she isn't once the change is actually happening. A fully bisexual woman might still be completely uncomfortable with the very, very odd ""in-between stage,"" when you've been on hormones for a while, possibly had other surgeries (not including SRS/GRS), when you're neither male or female.  

Separations that have to do with transsexualism/gid are often nasty and brutal affairs. You can't expect a heterosexual partner to remain with you once you change your sex. Children add another element of loss here, both when they are taken by your spouse or simply won't accept you. Anyone who has been to a TS support group or frequents TS forums most certainly has been privy to the ""my wife is leaving me and my kids won't talk to me!!!"" breakdown.

What the hell did you expect, anyway? That they'd love you regardless of what you are? That's fairy tale romance, and it doesn't happen in the real world. Sexuality is an incredibly personal matter and you can't expect a partner to be attracted to you once you've changed if there isn't a glimmer of attraction to that sex already.

This isn't even taking into account the changes YOU are going to go through while transitioning. Some transsexuals find their sexual polarity does a 180 once HRT begins. MtF's who assume they'd be lesbian suddenly are attracted to men, and FtM's suddenly attracted to women. It happens. Then there is the sticky situation of how to be sexual with your lover during this awkward period of time. For myself, I couldn't STAND being sexual with someone as a male. It was painful on levels both mental and spiritual and I know I'm not the only who felt that way.

Okay, deep breathes everyone. Take a step back and collect yourself.

 

It sucks to be lonely. I know, I was celibate and had no relationship for almost 8 years between the time I went full time and lost the girlfriend who thought she was bisexual enough to handle the transition and the time I had The Operation. It has to be mentioned that some people can handle a transitioning lover or spouse. Some even blossom under it. Some relationships get stronger. These are exceptions only, though, and you shouldn't expect it to happen. Still, I cannot recommend enough to avoid starting a relationship before you begin transition <I>unless you're absolutely certain your partner can handle it</I>, and most especially, <i>do not under any circumstances fail to tell a potential long-time partner about your transsexuality and live a lie until it consumes you.</i> 

You're opening yourself, and potential lovers and children, to the possibility of so much hurt. Transition is hard enough by itself. Being transsexual is one of the most difficult things someone can endure. Make it easier while you still have the choice to do it."

"event","I remember thinking way back in the day, I guess it would have been in the mid 80's, that I would one day have the operation to end all operations. THE operation. This screws with your head as a teenager, especially back then when the Internet did not exist at all minus the few BBS systems and ARPAnet stuff that I wasn't geeky enough to know about. Even if I did, transsexual resources online wouldn't really start making any true appearances until the days of alt.transgender and soc.support.transgender. Anything else was scattered and difficult to locate.

So you were basically doing everything on your own. You could read the biographies of Christine Jorgensen, Jan Morris, and Renee Richards if you wanted, and then some rather frightening textbooks on the subject, but in some ways they seemed about another place and time. It would be Caroline Cossey, for whatever reasons she felt the need to do it, making appearances on American television that would finally present me with my first real impression of what someone like me was like.

Back on subject now. Your life changes the instant you assign yourself these labels. 

<I>I am transsexual.</i>
<I>One day I will have a <b>sex change</B>.</I>

The confusion of the following days, weeks, months, years. Constantly questioning yourself, and fearing being discovered both before and after you actually begin transitioning. The utter hatred you suddenly feel at clothes which might have left you somewhat unsettled before, but now are a constant, grating reminder of what you haven't accomplished yet. Of a life you understand you must lead now and every single day that you don't make progress on it is a day you will not get back. When you're living at home with your parents this just makes things even worse. Not that you don't love them, but because you fear their abandonment. Back then, a teen-transitioner was unheard of. This was something you did once you were independent of your family because the examples you found in books and television all demonstrated that your family would disown you. I'm sure it happened somewhere, but I didn't know about it. And I knew, with gut-wrenching certainty, if I did tell my family about it I would be yanked into therapy to try to ""fix"" me. I didn't know this for a fact, mind you, it's just what my instincts told me and I had no reason whatsoever to question it.

Still, the acceptance of those labels rearrange everything yet again. Now you have direction, purpose, and a path to follow. Instead of not knowing the cause of your suffering, you now how to take steps to kill it completely. 

It's liberating.

Life, however, does not work in neat little orderly steps, and it most certainly doesn't wait for convenient times for making painful choices. You've heard all this before. Don't worry, I'm getting to a point. 

Sooner or later."

"event","I'm kidding myself if I think that anyone is actually going to read this. Too many others who've passed before me have written this type of thing, so it's not like I'm doing anything remotely groundbreaking or revolutionary. And that's not even going to the boring side of <I>yet another</I> transsexual biography.

But you see, I keep thinking to myself, I've lived a pretty cracked out life thus far. I've dealt with some major, major issues that get relegated to humorous skits on SNL, comedic absurdity on sitcoms, or treated with gruesome violence on film. Fascinating thing, having a sex change. I think there are people out there that want to know about it. It intrigues them in a way that nothing else can, in the same way androgynous anime characters get so many fan shrines dedicated to them. It's dark and moist in that way that your brain just can't let go of yet desperately tries to keep hold of, at times sexy and even pulse-raising in the sense of being forbidden but undeniably alluring. 

So few people ever see the beauty in it, and fewer less ever experience it. Problem is, for most of us, we've got our little secret and got honestly we like it that. But because of that secret, a lot of amazing things never get talked about.

I hope to talk about them here. Keep checking in and maybe I'll have something worth reading."

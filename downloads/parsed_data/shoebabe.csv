"event","Am watching American Idol now. I want Taylor Hicks to win! I know he's not your typical Americal Idol material (yawn, Chris) but it would be so interesting if he won. I bet they will even get him to endorse some hair product or hair colour or premature greying ad. 

Back to write more after Idol.

Ok, morbid post but hey, I don't want them to play some dumb song at my funeral (Gasp! For She Was A Jolly Good Fella?? Gasp! Give me CPR pronto!)

Songs I want played at my funeral:
(1) Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police
(2) Have I Told You Lately - Rod Stewart
(3) That I Would Be Good - Alanis (swell lyrics).

FYI - I'm obsessed but in case I forget at least I have Livejournal to remind me (for him):
(1) Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd
(2) These Are The Days - 10,000 Maniacs

Everyone needs a soundtrack to their life....

Go music."

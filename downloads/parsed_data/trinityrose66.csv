"event","Hey all I made something in ceramics and took it home today! And I sadly found out no one likes it. Thsi kinda depressed me a smidge. I got over it though cuz I am a trooper. I hope to put a picture of it on here later. I also got my hair cut! I think it looks pretty good but I and my sister may be the only people. Goodday!"

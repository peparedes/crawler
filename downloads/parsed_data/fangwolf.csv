I've decided to keep this LJ around and will use it for more personal posts.&nbsp; Most posts will be related to plush love and the furry fandom.&nbsp; 

FAU was a great convention this year.&nbsp; Shy Matsi did a great job with the con suite and I got to see many old friends.&nbsp; It was great seeing Kuddlepup and rehashing some of the old pawpet show memories.&nbsp; I was close to winning the bid for Ezra's goggles in the charity auction but didn't speak up loud enough for my next bid to be heard!&nbsp; Ah well, it was all great fun.&nbsp; 

My fursuit from Lacy is half paid off.&nbsp; I must find ways to pay the rest off so I can finally get one.&nbsp; Conventions would be a lot more fun if i was able to perform in fursuit.&nbsp; I will be so nervous though.&nbsp; 

On the plush front, I recently just won a large Kiara plush off E-bay &quot;new&quot; with tags.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love the large felines lately.&nbsp; Now to find a Douglas Simba.&nbsp; And I'm supposed to be a wolf. &nbsp;What strong powers these ebil felines have over me!"

"event","I'm in love with my new car and most everyone seems to love the Crimson color. :)  It turns out I didn;t have the gap insurance, but the dealer was charging me $500 + for window etching and a tire service plan on my old deal.  Those papers were never signed and it makes me question what they did. They said they'll try to get a pro-rated refund on the remaining policy.  This time I have gap for sure.  I'll have to take some pics of it to share here soon.

Continued physical therapy on my neck and shoulders and go back again on Wednesday.  I really dislike it getting dark so soon now.  I miss the days of coming home from work and having 80 degree weather and sunshine."

"event","Thanksgiving dinner went well at my aunts house.  It was cool to sit around chatting with my cousins and such about technology and crap like that.  My aunt is remodeling her kitchen and is going to give me her 'old' 1999 dishwasher.  It's little things like this that get me excited.  Aren't I weird?  I'm going to have to find someone with a pickup or van to get it back to my house.  Hmm <LJ USER=""Toracub""> comes to mind lol.

This weekend I'm going to try to see about getting a new or used car since my rental will end on Monday.  I may have to wait since I'll be about $1000 in the hole with no trade in or down payment.  Hyundai is having their Thanksgiving sale with rebates on 04 models along with a Hyundai loyalty rebate so that might not be a bad offer.  
My friend Dave H.  (nooo not Dave Hopkins hehe) but rather Lead Master Huggie (don't ask!) will be visiting me tomorrow since he's back in MD for the holidays.  I'm glad to hear his cancer is on the retreat.  Perhaps we'll gather up Mark and Rett and have a good nite of silliness like in the past.  

On the health front:  I'm still having problems with dizziness and balance as well as with abdominal pain and possible uti.  I'll have to keep up with the docs.  Physical therapy starts on Monday."

"event","Happy Thanksgiving!  There hasn't been much to give thanks for this year, but  I'm very thankful for some things I have in my life.  May of my friends mean the world to me and have helped me through some of the toughest times.  I don't think I'd survive without my friends.  I'm also thankful for having such a great mom to be here for me in times of need.  I sometimes get resentful towards her because I'm still here caring for her, but overall, I'm damn lucky to have someone as accepting and loving as she is.

I'll most likely head to my aunts house for some turkey and then back to work tomorrow.  This weekend I plan on buying a car of some type.  I may wait to buy a new one and just pick up some old crappy one for now. Hmm

Anyways have a great day everyone and I'll leave you with a link to one of my new favorite fur artists  Hanwolf directed me to this art and I instantly fell in love with the cute style. Take a <A HREF=""http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/Paddy/"">LOOK</A>."

Lastly, it does 1280x1024 @ 85 Htz.  Most likely I'll stick with mye 1024x768 tho.  Thanks everyone for your input!

"event","I purchased a new 19"" ViewSonic monitor from Best buy tonight and lugged it home only to find that the menu buttons push all the way into the case (great QA guys).  Naturally I was expecting something to be wrong with it because I have what's known as the $100 curse.  Every item, or service I buy that's over $100 seems to be defective or broken.  It doesn't matter if it's computers, car radios, printers or even medical or legal services.  

I noticed the Samsung monitor was more slim in design with better side buttons and also noticed the dot pitch was a tad better with a higher support resolution.  My question is now, whats a better monitor?  I'm hoping someone could guide me to the right one.  

Do I choose the <a href=""http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/FlatCDT/Monitor_FlatCDT_997DF.htm"">Samsung 997DF</A> OR the 
<a href=""http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/crtmonitors/aseries/a91f/"">ViewSonic A91F+</A>?

The ViewSonic is slightly more money and bulkier, yet I heard they're a great brand. Hmmmm"

Glass flew all over my face and cut my ear up.  I'm lucky thats all that got cut.  It took forever for it to stop bleeding and a bandaid in my ear is helping.  Oddly enough the filament of the bulb did not break, but everything else did.  

I started playing Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude and it just doesn't have the same feel as the older ones.  It's just another annoying 3D game.  I miss the old 2D graphic adventue games like Spaces Quest, Inherit the Earth, Simon the Sorcerer and Kings Quest."

March 20, 1984

To:  David

Twelve years ago, on this very day -
you entered this world in a different way.
Your mother was happy, even though she
had pain - and the first time she
saw you, she went almost insane!
""He's not my child 'cause he's ugly
you see"", but after six months, she
said ""David's for me"".

As you've grown through the years
to be a handsome young man, we're
glad that mom didn't throw you
in the trash can.  Joy and happiness
you brought to our life, no other child
could ever replace, the wonderful
feeling you give to this husband and wife.
We've always been proud that you are
our son - and we will love you
forever - Now lets have some fun!

Happy Birthday - (guess who?)"

The manager asked Kuddlkat to remove his head so he could see his face for a second.  I guess that's a security thing they must do, which I understand.  I mean if he were to rob the place, it would be difficult to explain to the police that a large cat held the place up hehe.

What was wrong with me then?  Yes indeedy! My room used to be covered with beer posters of big-breasted women and cans on the walls.  I'm glad I came to my senses in the 90's lol.  My dad used to work at a liquor store and would bring home posters, cans and stuff, so I guess the exposure got me into it.

"event","Not too much going on this weekend.  Maxi and I went to the computer sow and I bought a new case.  It's a pearl white case with an information area that lights up blue on the front.  I'd say it looks a bit macish in a way.  

Also finally got the Sims2.  Hmm where's the nudie patch? LOL  The game started off with the mother vomiting in the dirty toilet.  Heh, how interesting.

Today was laid back somewhat.  I spend a good deal of time in Home Depot getting shelves for the basement

Fox is coming by tomorrow to suck my ducts.  I sure hope this takes care of my allergies when the heat runs.

Happy Columbus Day!"

One student almost popped the baby's belly because he blew too hard into it's mouth. (Yes it was a dummy of course).  I recommend anyone who hasn't had training to look into it. :)  Thank goodness for plastic face shields!

This weekend was nice.  I spend some time with <lj user =""Pandaguy"">, <lj user=""Toracub"">, <lj user=""shy_matsi""> and <lj user=""maximous"">.  I went to a computer store in Fairfax VA and bought an Asus A7N8X-E Deluxe motherboard and 512 MB RAM.  Thanks to Kuddlkat for the Athlon XP processor.  In time I'll replace it wih a faster processor.  I never did buy the Sims2.  Maybe next time."

Anyways, last night I went to bed and an hour later woke up with such an attack.  Upon putting my glasses on I noticed the temple was bent and both nose pads were broken totally off!  I didn't fall asleep with them on and even if I did, it wouldn't of broke the nose pads.  I really can't explain how it happened and it's been freaking me out all day.  I need to put a cam on me at night so I can see what's going on.

I guess it's time for a new pair of glasses.  I wonder what kind of frames would look spiffy on me."

The rain (remnents of Jeanne) yesterday was really bad in some areas, and I see that the area south of me where I previously worked got flooded quite badly.  The bridge I used to drive on each day was under water!  They showed a few car rescues on the news as well.  I guess I'm lucky things weren't as bad around my house."

"event","I've been busy all this week with work and then helping out a neighbor with their PC problems.  The last thing I want to do is work on someone's computer after doing it all day, but I guess it's good doing my good deed for the day.

Online has been stressful for me lately.  I really enjoy having a diverse and unique group of online friends and acquaintances, but I think it's time to really trim back on my buddy lists.  I've always tried to be open and understanding and listen to others.  Sometimes I adapt who I am just to fit in with a group of people.  Sometimes these people are not even desirable to talk with, but yet curiosity draws me in and they're still interesting nonetheless.  I'm learning the hard way that you can't always see the good in someone.  Having many online friends is really about the opposite of how I was growing up in school when I had none.  I use the term friends loosely because many of the people in my contacts lists are just ones I've talked to briefly here and there.  Some of them are much more to me than that.  I used to think it was safe and fun to be online doing as I wanted, being someone I am not, but now I think it can be dangerous and unhealthy.  Any thoughts?  I feel happy to be open-minded and feel sorry for people who are not.  

I truly think I would be happy being a psychologist.  Talking to many different walks of life, learning and understanding them seems to be a lot of what fuels my interests.  I just wish I had the means to go back to college.  As I said before, it would be nice to keep computer stuff as a hobby, but move onto something more rewarding as a career."

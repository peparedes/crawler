Anyways, I saw this in Becca's livejournal and thought I'd try it out. Here's what my birth date says about me:

*** Being born on the 21st day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 
The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 
There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, ""couldn't care less"" attitude.

You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 
Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 
You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. ***

Hmm... your thoughts?

Have fun tonight everyone :)"

"event","#1. Thanks to everyone in I Remember Mama - I had such a blast and I absolutely love you guys. Good times, y'all.

#2. PROM on Saturday! I'm going with Q so it's a guaranteed good time. I bought my earrings and shoes today, so fun :) I can't wait!

#3. AP tests - I've decided that I really don't care about the outcome at this point. I've already gotten into college and I really don't care if I have to take all 4 years of English. It's not worth me studying for at all, plus I'm just lazy.

#4. Summer is soon! So far I have a babysitting job & I think I'm going to work downtown at my dad's office about 3 days a week... little nervous about that. Not sure how I feel about the whole seeing my dad that much thing- I'm scared he'll be really hard on me or something. Whatever, I could use the money.

#5. I heart life. I'm so content these days, it's nuts."

"event","So overall, awesome weekend. Shamrock Shimmy - Very fun. I have this theory where dances are what you make of them, and I think everyone decided to just let go last night and make it a good time, which was sweet. 

Got ready with Heids, Clare, Gwen, & Kel Krum before the dance - good times. No, we did not drink. I think we were part of the 6% who didn't. Rock on. OH so get this! I forgot my ID for the dance and they wouldn't let me in! I was like OK you all know me from Student Council, who are you kidding? Stupid Oberg. If it had been P.Mo he would've totally let me in cause he's all gangsta like that.

Dance was fun.

Post-Dance? ""OHhhh decisions, decisions!"" hahaha. Turns out I avoided both situations. Go figure. 

Today is Caroline's beach volleyball bday party and also my mother's birthday! Tonight we're going to this awesome restaurant in Naperville (Rosebud) with my brother Steve and his wife Jenn. Should be fun :) Steve's ridiculous so it'll be an awesome time.

Hope y'all had a great weekend! :)

Bark because I love you :) I think I had one of my most embarrassing moments when Gwen points to her pelvic region and says ""Hey Laura what do you call the organ underneath here where the penis is inserted?"" and I said ""stomach!"".... I was only half listening so I guess it serves me right.

Next Heidi and I are at White Hen and decide to try Red Bulls just for kicks. We have 2 each then decide hey, let's check out the choir concert. So we're sitting there like twitching during these crazy hymn-ish songs. Good times.

Vanessa Funk's + Charades + Theatre Kids = Love y'all. Seriously.

Next stop: Kyle, Dave, Caitlin, Paul... ohh Dave. I don't even know what to say.

Last destination: Steevensz's to meet her Okie bf, Eric. Seems like cool guy - he's a collar popper so I'm guessing that means good things. 

Sham Shim tomorrow- I better be seeing you all there! And I'm Irish, so just keep that in mind.

"event","So yeah, life is sweet. If you're wondering about the title of this entry, it's referring to my Thursday\Saturday night character for ""I Remember Mama"" - Slutty Nurse Veronica. That's right. David Mackenzie (who plays the doctor) & I decided to make our characters have an affair\love interest. So I mentioned it to Foxypants and he took it to town, seriously. Now there's an entire flirt fest between the two of us that is way racy and sweet. I love it! Meaning I love being a skank- I guess it's nothing new... Haha :)

   Shamrock Shimmy this weekend! Totally my favorite dance. SO excited! Fact: I'm 75% Irish. Who knew? Insane, I know. But you know what that means? I can wear ""Kiss Me, I'm Irish"" pins and really mean it! How lovely.

   Know what else is lovely? The fact that spring break is in FIFTEEN DAYS! AHhh I love that. I really need to get out of here. This whole grey skies\end of winter slump thing is just not workin for me these days. Sun & blue skies here I come... :)

Apparently I get to be Mama in the Friday night show, the day after my bday! (which is April 21st, so feel free to give me a hug\miraculous gift of any sort\sexual favors...) I'm quite psyched about this whole thing, even though it's going to be a crazy amount of work. Whatever, I'm up for it :)

Fashion show update: I get to wear a total Cinderella dress-- Ice blue strapless dress, poofy, random beads, clear shoes, the WORKS! How fun is that? I'm thinking I might even carry a pumpkin down the runway for kicks. Not really, but that would be sweet. My group= Kennedy, Wiebe, Addie Curphey, & Anna Losasso, so that should be fun. 

Spring Break- 22 days... AHH I can't wait! School is so NOT a priority to me anymore, I've got senioritis like nobody's business. PS I hate when people say senioritis so I don't really know why I did it. Sorry about that. 

Shoutout to Q for the ""nifty gift"" (I liked how it rhymed).

Have a good weekend, y'all. YAY for 3 days off! :)

Congratulations to everyone involved with I Remember Mama! Yay for an amazing last show. Let's do it. Oh, and for those who have not yet been informed, I am the nurse in the show. I've decided to take the initiative and be a Slutty Nurse: think slutty nurse costumes at costume shops or as seen on blow up dolls. Best part? Mr. Foxypants suggested the name ""Cookie"" for my character. Golden. 

Fashion Show this Saturday! I'll be sportin David's Bridal and be dancing to ""Land of 1000 Dances""... inTENSE! I'm super psyched. It should be good times. I'll probably cry because I'm pathetic like that, but it's all good. Mrs. McAndrew is my model mom which is just so exciting. Have our fitting tomorrow after school, I'll let you know how that turns out.

Spring Break in 24 days! I'll be hittin up Naples, Florida... aka the beach thank GOODNESS! Get me out of this terrible winter weather, I hate it! Cold = Bad. Warm = Orgasm. Enough said. Oh, and I'm really excited to buy fun bikinis and such. Plus sand castles just mean a good time had by all. 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HEIDI TOMORROW! March 1st - tell her you love her. Love you dear :) Yay for celebrating 16 birthdays together. That's pretty dang sweet.

Anyways, guess what I did today? Went SWIMMING! That's right - swimming in February. Ok so it was at the indoor pool at Healthtrack but seriously, it rocked. Heids and I did 30 laps - wuwu. I'm super sore but feelin really good, so it was worth it.

I have a confession to make: I LOVE American Idol. I haven't missed a season. It's like this crazy addiction- Idol and One Tree Hill. What's with me? I think it's just because I love Simon. Everyone thinks he's mean but I love that he's so honest. We need someone to kick us in the ass every once in a while - agreed? 

BECKY is coming this weekend! And by Becky, I mean my friend from Ohio that went to camp with me for 8 years... we're so tight and I haven't seen her in almost 2 years so this is awesome news. She and her mom are staying downtown Chicago so Heids & I are going to dinner with them on Saturday night. SO exciting! 

Know what else is exciting? Having our audition workshop tomorrow for ""I Remember Mama""! I'm not so sure how I feel about the script, but I'm psyched anyways. It will be funny if it's casted well, so we'll see how that goes. If I don't make it I might play soccer, so it all works out.

Love you guys - happy belated Valentine's Day!

"event","Hmm.... Good weekend. After Clare and I's kickass Friday night (yeah Jamba!), Saturday was kinda crazy. I-Searched for about 3 hours and FINISHED IT cause I ROCK then had Family Bowling :) Yeaaaah it was a CRAZY WILD time let me tell ya! Bowled a 149- not too shabby if I may say so myself. Bowling league?>> It's always a possibility.

Saturday night- went to dinner with the fam + Alex Steevensz at some restaurant called Luigi's down Roosevelt Road. Amazing! Clare you'd love it, we have to go there sometime. Afterward we saw 'Finding Neverland'... Johnny Depp... need I say more? Holy. Shit. It. Was. Awesome. Alex & I both cried, it was way intense. Go see it!

Sunday- ...I hate goodbyes :( It was really hard watching my nephews & brother leave. Jake (4 year old) kept holding onto my leg and crying, Big Daddy style. It was terrible! I was just waiting for him to be like ""But I wipe my own ass!..."" just like that cute little kid in the movie. I always cry at that part. So obviously, I had another good cry when they left. Along with my mother who wailed the WHOLE afternoon, no joke. She sat in the living room just holding Baby Tyler's toys and sobbing... talk about a mental breakdown.

We had our first blocking rehearsal today for the Blackbox!! (Dearly Departed). It's so intense, I can't wait for y'all to see it. Matt & Tim = best directors ever. We have such a blast. Plus my character is just hardcore obnoxious and that's super fun to do. I mean it's just so naaaatural and everything :) January 26-28, be there!

Last weekend - Northwestern. Clare said enough about that & I'm really too lazy to get into it. Moral of the story is: Oh God?

Longest week of my life... all two days I was at school! Haha. First basketball games! Gotta love it. Really weird to see all the old players there again - aka Joey and Company. It was cool to see him though, he's so fun... I mean I hate him? (Oh Clare...)

I LOVE Thanksgiving! Crazy relatives + 3 bottles of wine = A good time had by all. P.S. I kick ass at Texas Hold 'Em. Bring it on, bitches...

I-Search like hell all weekend... finished 5 pages today! Doing it on Equus- big surprise, huh? I swear, one of these days I'll stop talkin about that show. Oh wait, no I won't. I mean come ON they got naked! I just can't handle it people. 

Tonight: One Voice Chili dinner. Great times. Jake in the front row pickin his nose,  yellin ""AUNT LAURA"" between every song, haha. Then awkward? Ha, I love it.

Watched 'When Harry Met Sally' with Clare - sigh. I wanna marry someone who will karaoke with me in a store at the top of his lungs. It's all about them little things.

Love you Dave.

Made a Walgreen's run with Clare, Heidi & Kira to get fun hair things. Haha, we are SUCH nerds, I love it! Then headed over to the football game with the gals- so how fun is it being a senior again? Oh yeah, very. (More on that later...)

Saturday- wake up early, get the REST of my hair chopped off... aka the last inch of straight so now it's like WAY curly. My dad has picked up my old nickname ""Curly Sue"" once again. (Weird...) Went out to lunch with Lauren & the fam at Champp's, saw Ms. DIEMER! What?!?! Yeah, she was on a date! Didn't recognize me from the back due to my new 'do. Anyhow, she loves me - yay for amazing college recs! 

Went shopping with Lauren & Steevensz... that was fun- I could literally live at Target the rest of my life and never get bored\hungry\lonely. Speaking of living at Target, if you've never seen the movie ""Career Opportunities"", go rent it. Uh-may-zing. 

Last night, dinner with the WHOLE family (including Steve & Jenn plus Dave & his girlfriend since he's back from school.) Lauren, Heidi & Ki came over for some hardcore Euchre- Steve and I have yet to be beaten!! Yes, I am that awesome. 

Hung out with the girls, then Heidi left to go to Joel's. So Kira, Lauren & I took car markers and wrote cute stuff all over her car while she was there (""Queen of Q""- I know you get that C! haha) & then called her and video-taped her as she came out. Hilarious. Drove around a bit, found Knaus and his cute friends, then headed back to Joel's where Kira proceeded to jump in his pool and then we left. RJ= funniest drunk ever. Love him.

 Went back to Ki's and watched ""Butterfly Effect"" - love Ashton but seriously, scary movies are just NOT my thing. Had extreme nightmares. Cuuuute...

Later went to see 'Garden State' with Clare & Lindsey and OH MY GOD!! First off, someone told me before I saw it that I reminded them of Natalie Portman in that movie. And weirdly they were right... she talked just like me and acted just like me- weird.

So we leave there super hyper... aka I was super hyper. Couldn't stop laughing\talking. Nothing new, really. Went to Vince's, picked up some drunk kids, drove them around and laughed at their drunkness. (Violins??? Hahaha)Overall a good night.

Sunday went for a super long walk with Kira and just chilled. Uber nice weather and such, so that was cute. VMAs were quite the disappointment- Britney and Justin not being there ruined it for me. Not to mention Kerry's daughters are freakin annoying. 

Today was the best!! 1st Natalie tackled Lauren in team sports while playing an innocent pick-up game of volleyball. You'd think there was a reason for it, but no. Basically it comes down to Natalie being a violent bitch. Again, nothing new there! Haha love you Butters. THEN after school was the audition workshop- yay for hilarious theatre kids. Good times.

Then we watched the Road Rules Marathon-- discovered we hate Nick... he's a giant dipwad. (Good insult, I know.) On our walk back to my house, we saw (drumroll please) a cat on a bike! This guy had a little platform on the back of his bike and his cat was just sitting on it! What if he ran over Fluffy?! Animal cruelty, I tell you.

Later, went to Red Robin (with Clare- can you tell I hate her?) to meet Ben & Co. That was nice, haven't seen that crowd in awhile. 4 years for me, 3 years for you, Clare... haha :)

Popped on over to Heidi's with gymnastics boys + Kira... and went crazy - oops. Yeah, the night started out with some clean ol' fun and ended up with Kira & I practically falling over laughing. (""Stephy, wanna talk about... warts...with us?"" --I swear we love Heidi's dog!) Turns out we became super annoying because we wouldn't stop laughing --I tried to control myself, I really did. But I failed miserably--apologies to all that witnessed our antics. 

Headed back to my house for cookies (Snickerdoodles) with Q & Clare- Mmmm. I'm starting to enjoy these late night feasts in my kitchen. I'll try to speed up my eating, Clare... haha :)

The kids were so precious... it broke my heart because I knew that nearly all the kids were getting ready to be put up for adoption sometime soon. Walked away feeling pretty sad, but it was all for a good cause and the kids had fun, so I'm happy.

On a lighter note! Two of the guys there were about 14 (D'Angelo and Lawrence) and they sat with Heidi and I for awhile talking about music and stuff. Yeah that's right, I was naming rappers THEY didn't know! They were all impressed that this suburban white chick new what was up. Damn straight. I love being black.

Well L.B. came up to me and (not making this up) put his wrist up to mine like we were Power Rangers and was like ""Yeah! Yellow bracelets!"" Naturally, we kept this up and eventually his mom came and took him away. Probably freaked out that her kindergartener was picking me up. Just kidding, I wasn't actually attracted to him. But the ""Bracelet Power!"" thing was quite fun while it lasted.

Miss you, Joe! :)

Song of the Day: ""Untouchable Face"", Ani DiFranco. I love angry songs, don't you? 

And back to 'Bread and Wine'... Kill me now..."

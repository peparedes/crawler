"event","I am so glad to be back to an area that I am happy to be be in!!!
  this trip has been a Feasco from the begining!
  left for the airport early, but he train I always take to the airport, stopped in a place called Chiba, about 45 min from the Airport, and I have to change trains, but miss the next train. so I have to wait an hour for he next one,  this makes me 45 minuets late for my 2 hours prior check in. thinking that I could get some sleep, what was I thinking? Children screaming during for almost the entire flight!
  San Jose:  this place has to have the worst customs in the nation! They had 3 lines open for about 350 people, about 75% of us were Citizens or Residents, and only 1 of the 3 lines were for us. This resulted in a hour wai before they opened up another line for us. after all that time waiting it takes me about 30 seconds to go through customs. 
  I get something to eat and wait in line to ceck in. Just As I get to the counter the guy gets a call from the ground crew and guess what...Planes Broke!!!  So I get redirected from my flight to St Lois to Chicago, I am only 2 hours behind schedule by this time, and now I am in Chi Town.
  Getting ready for the time to board the plane and they say that they say that they are rolling a new plane out from the hanger and it will take about a half hour for all the inspections before boarding will take place. we get to Columbus and I go to the Baggage claim, No baggage for me , no that would be convienient. so I fill out a claim check and go to the rental car counter to pick up my car, and I find out that they dont take Debit Cards.
 So I go to Budget and get one. Supposed to be at my moms house around Midnight, I get there @ 3:30. and of course all the doors are locked.
  the Day after next (saturday) I go Visit my father on the ther side of the state, no problems there but the next day I call my mother to tell thaat I have been invited to a family reunion my mother tells me that no morthan 10 after I had left her house Her mother had passsed away, and I was to visit her at the home the next day. so there are 2 days for the showings and then the Funeral. well due to the Death of my Grandmother I have to move my flight back a couple of days which I have to change plans with my sister and my friends for an Airport Pick up. well after a couple of days of not being able to get in touch to conirm changes to the plans, my sister calls about midnight and TOTALLY Pisses my step father... is ok I ate the fucker anyway, I mean this is the man who tought me how to hate! Well he goes of on how I gave her the # to the house, (even thougt my mother had asked me to do this a while ago!) and fro making long-distance calls, (I had asked permission first). So Asshole states that 'I have to pack and be gone as soon as the funerla is over and If I ever come to the house there again he'll kill me' And now you know why I hate this slug of a Man! I get to Cali with out much of A hitch except for waiting at the airport and the is 'cause no one was expecting me. thankks to my GREAT Friend Amethyst Rose! well that is it for now! 

  Laters! F"

  Ok here we go theis is how I deal with stress. (And it works)
  1) place hands on wall, or any other hard surface
  2) Move head forward in an accelerating mannor
  3) Repeat as often as nessecary until desired effect is achieved.
  4) if unconciousness is achieved, STOP! Regain Conciousness and repeat steps 1~3

  There we goes peoples, I cure all for stress!

   Now that I am nolonger fumming about what happened to Mr.& Mrs. T. Squirrel I can tell you that everything here is still SEVERLY messed in my life. Not really sure what is going on between my Nipponjin Doll and Ibut It looks like I am going to have to play the 'Waiting game'. I hate the Waiting game the rules suk! but anyway, I am absolutly Enthrawled with her. Sure she is 10 years my Elder but it is beter than the 17 yrs difference my Lying X claimed to be 6 instead. Sorry if the sentances doo not meake sense, you try typing English while your mind is contemplating Japanese. And I have also (in my finate wisdom)figured out why alot of JN's (Japanese Nationals) where glasses. You look at squiggely linse for a long period of time and you go blind too!!  maybe thier DR was my Shrink @ San Diego?  He diagnosed me as being non homocidal and Sczephrenic. Obvestly we think he was a Quack! I dont think I would send a Rabid Badger high on PCP to these guys..... ok maybe I would but that is for the Entertainment value only, Have I evermentioned I HATE stupid peoples? 

  Well today is another day o the Boat, and to is PFT day....yeah (shoot me please.) not really much say about here, If you get pics from me, they are NOT to be passed around with out my consent. 
   Ok love ya alls,

2. If you were not in the navy what would you be doing? this is a 2 sided qestion for me.I have never imagined not being in the Military, Im the 3rd generation to be in sevice. I guess npot that I have the skills that I do, I would be doing electronics for the government, or probably for an airline company.

3. What was your favorite subject in school? Duh, Chemistry/Physics. I stil remember my first batch of home made C4 (suspended for a week!!)

4. Space Ghost, Brak or Zorak? Zorak! SG is to Cheezy (but still cool) Brak is an idiot (you know i hate stupid people real or animated) Zorak just want to get out of his prison and kill someone just for relief of frustrtion and fun.... don't we all?

5. What is your single worst flaw and how do you work to overcome it? My arrogance! and you all can deal with it! (JK)Im arrogant sometimes, it depends who I am dealing with, some people I am kind gentle and the nicest person you could know, to others, If I view you as being below me in standing, I would rather not deal with you unless you can do something I need to have done or something i dont want to do. this mailny applies a work, but then again Im a supervisor! HA it is My right have others do the crappy jobs!"

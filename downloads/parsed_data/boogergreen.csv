"event","I just bought the Jimmy Eat World CD.  I'm addicted.  No joke.  Something about it makes me want to roll my window down and just drive.  That's the kind of music everyone needs.  Driving music.  I don't like driving as it is, but I definitely can tolerate it much better when I have some good tunes. :)  So.....  I got my dress.  I would love to have you ladies come over one day and I'll try it on and show you!  It will be fun.....I think anyways.  

I am starting to get slightly stressed about the wedding.  I am figuring around 300 people, give or take a few with a 10,000 dollar budget.  I know it's possible but it's going to be tight.  I am trying to deside if I really want a reception or just have cake afterwards.  If I have a reception....it's going to cost sooooo much!  We'll see.  Mark and I definitely need to finalize a few more things if I can get that man to sit down for 30 minutes with me and talk about the wedding.  I have always said that Mark is a perfect balance of what I am.  I am high-strung and semi-crazy.  Mark is so laid back and easy going.  It's awesome because he helps me relax when I'm stressed but in this situation it's hard for me to get him to help me make any decisions!  

Did I mention lately how much I enjoy my job?  I do.  I have now been given the title as the 'commercial girl'.  It's definitely a challenge.  All I do is count and add THOUSANDS of dollars EVERY DAY.  I appreciate that they think I do a great job but I get tired.  My hands literally hurt at the end of the day.  My back is sooo tense all the time.  Can you imagine someone coming to you and asking you to count 400 in ones.  4000 in twenties.  6000 in hundreds.  All day.  It's a lot of money.  

I love being a red head, but it's a pain to dye it.  I have to dye my hair so bad, but I just can't seem to find the time.  AKA, I'm too lazy.  I need to clean my room too...but as you can see by me posting, I have found better things to do with my time.  

My toe nails are black.  I feel like a rebel.  I love it too.  I had Qdoba tonight and it made me think of my lovely ladies because they introduced me to that place.....and I LOVE IT.  Chicken burrito....yummy!  

So, I think that my lovely bridesmaids and I need to get together for lunch.
Pam, Emily, Noelle, and Stephanie.  That's a party in itself.  Life is wonderful when you are awesome.

Okay, enough of my rambling nonsense.  I must sleep soon.  Mark and I are going to First Presbytarian Church of Troy tomorrow.  That's the church that Marky might be working at soon.  I guess he has a meeting with the Pastor and the financial committee on Wednesday and they are going to discuss everything.  Mark really wants the job....but the drive is going to be a pain.  He is going to try to get them to agree to 20 hours a week which would be awesome.  I am happy for him and I cannot wait to be his wife!  If you haven't met him yet, you should, but ladies, don't get any ideas because he is mine!!!! :)"

"event","Mark and I celebrated my birthday on Friday together.  I told him I wanted El Charritos....  I met him at my house and instead of going to El Charritos...he took me to a park and had take out!  It was very romantic, I wasn't expecting it at all.  Yesterday, my Dad's band had a concert in Caseville which was wonderful.  I like to see my Dad have such a great time.  Today has been rather uneventful and I like it that way.  Everyone has been asking me what I'm doing for my BIG 21st birthday...and I always say nothing.  Mark and I got to lead worship this morning which was interesting.  The first service wasn't so hot but the second one was smooth like butter.  No joke.  My parents and Mark took me to Applebee's for lunch and then I took a nap.  I ran up to the good ole Vg's and got some cupcakes and some wine coolers for my and the rents.  

So that's my birthday weekend for you all in a nutshell.  It's been simple, but exactly how I wanted it.

The only thing that would make this 12 times better is if....I got to see my wonderful ladies.  Thanks for the text Noelle...definitely made my day! :)

I went to Dort Federal Credit Union and Elga Credit Union today and put in my application/resume.  I have a good feeling about it.  Ceasar salads from Vgs are amazing and very filling.  Sour cream and onion pringles are the best.  The girl at the tanning place knows my name now.  Weird.  

Mark and I got into a fight again last night...guess what about...music.  Dang it.  We both can be sooo stubborn sometimes and we were fighting at my house after church.  My mom was on the phone with her family, just crying her eyes out.  I hate that.  After she was off the phone, she came into the sun room where Mark and I were fighting and said, 'What are you guys doing?'  'Fighting.'  'Well, stop for a minute and come talk to me about all this.'  I realized what happens when people don't communicate and when people are stubborn, it rips families apart.  I refuse to ever be that way.  I love Mark and one day he will be part of my family...so we both apologized to each other, and it was smooth sailing afterwards. ;)

It's weird how much he loves me.  When we were fighting on the way home in his car, I was yelling and he was yelling.  Then there was silence.  I was angry.  Yet Mark still manages to say, 'Hey Steph.' 'What?!' 'I love you, don't ever forget that.'  Then there was silence again.  I didn't know if I wanted to cry, hug him, or get even more angry.  What a good guy for loving me and always reminding me that he does."

"event","It's Saturday afternoon and my spring break is rapidly approaching being over.  I'm bummed about that.  This week has been a glorious week full of sleeping in until 11 and spending time with my wonderful boyfriend.  I made my transition to the Burton store successfully but I must admit I miss the hustle and bustle of the Pontiac store.  I miss a lot of things.  I even miss all the drama and the nights when I wanted to pull my hair out.  Now- I'm bored and everyone is snotty, customers and employees.  My dad keeps telling me about all these Credit Union part time jobs that are available and they are becoming much more appealing.  Maybe I'll get an interview or something to try it out and see if it's better than good ole Vg's.  This is the first Saturday that I've had off since Christmas Eve and I am bored out of my mind.  I went tanning and cleaned my car and bedroom....and it's only 3.  Dang it!

On Tuesday night, something amazing happened.  Mark and I went looking at rings...and I found one that I fell in love with.  The only problem is the price tag.  $3199.00  That's right.  I told Mark that $3200  is waaaaaay too much and his response was that my eyes lit up and it looked like I was going to pass out.  He said that price isn't an issue because there is no price on our love and if that ring is the one I love, that he will save up for it because he loves me!  I still think it's outrageous but I love that he doesn't care.  We found it at Osterman Jewelers so maybe my buddy Krystal Corwin can get me a deal because she works there....we'll see.  Let's just say that the ring is beautiful...seriously."

After Archie's Mark came over to the house.  I seriously love this guy.  Geez.  He learned how to sing harmony yesterday and wanted me to hear, once he started singing he got really nervous....  I am so proud of him.  He was leaving at around 10 because we both had to get up early today...  We were outside (because the weather is absolutely amazing) saying our goodbyes....and I said, 'Let's get married.'  He's like, 'Yeah, we'll go up to the court house on Saturday and take care of that.  No, we can't do that but do you want to start looking at rings on Saturday?'

HOLY CRAP.

Looking at RINGS.  For ME.  I'm getting MARRIED....next year.

As you can tell, I'm rather excited about all of this because everything is perfect.  What is even better is that Mark knows how excited I am, and he is just as excited or more.  Wow."

It was the coolest thing I've done all day.  Now I'm waiting in the music lab for my theory group to show up....slackers.  No.  I'm just a little early you could say.  So....  I told my boss Jennie yesterday that I'm going to be stepping down from customer service specialist next year.  Her comment was, I new it would happen eventually, thank you for letting me know so far in advance.  I figured I should tell her.  Well, my group is here now!  Adios."

I'm back to school...and things are going well.  I'm only taking 12 credits this semester because I'm working full time but it is still hard to balance everything.  Mark and I decided that when he's done with school next year and gets a full time job, I'll work part time and finish school faster!  If I don't, it's going to take me like 8 years.  Maybe not, but I don't want to find out.  I have to work today 11-7:30.  I'm going to come home and do homework.  Yippee.  Tomorrow I have school from 9:20-11:47 (my 8am class is canceled).  After that I'm going to come home and clean my car and go to church.  Thursday I'm working and then going to the car show with Mark.  Friday I have school and work.  Saturday I work, and then I'm going to see the Flint Symphony Orchestra....Yes.....  My boyfriend is very much a manly man.  Big muscles, likes cars....this list is very long.

I love him and he loves me. <3"

"event","SHORT VERSION:
Happy New Year.  Mark comes home from Texas on Thursday!  :(  It's killing me.  Pam, Noelle, Archie's is calling our names for Sunday afternoon at 12:30......  It's time to get back to business.



NOT SO SHORT VERSION:
Happy new year everyone.  I've never really been one to be into resolutions and stuff....it just isn't my thing.  I worked yesterday harder than I've worked in a long time.  We were short staffed and I had to work the equivalent of three people, seriously.  I felt bad because I was kind of mean to the people I work with just because I was stressed out and couldn't be 'normal happy Stephanie'.  So I apologize.  After working my butt off until 9pm...and drove home.  I just started thinking about this whole year and everything that's happened.  The whole first half of the year was pretty terrible but I wouldn't take any of it back if I could.  I think it has really developed me into the person I am now.  In April when I moved back home, it was glorious and it still is.  The relationship that we have as a family is stronger now than it ever has been.  After I moved back home and began to hang out with Pam and Noelle and I honestly cannot even describe what these girls have done for me.  I am so proud to call them my friends.  I am so thankful to call them my friends.  Those girls are truly amazing.  I met Mark when I moved back home in April too.  Ahhh....  We were talking on the phone last night and just discussing how it's beautiful how our relationship happened.  When I first met him, I obviously thought he was cute, but didn't think that I would ever love him, or that he would ever learn to love me back....  No joke!  I am not an easy person to like, and even harder to love.  If you love Stephanie, part of you is insane and part of you is incredible.  Mark comes home from Texas on Thursday and I honestly cannot wait.  It feels like he's been gone for a month!  Man oh man I love that boy.  More than anything actually.  Pam and Noelle, Archie's.  You know the drill."

"event","OH SO HAPPY.

No lie.  Last night, during the blizzard....

I went and surprised Mark at work.  I was thinking about him yesterday and so I bought this GREAT teddy bear and some Hershey's kisses....and made a big poster for him.  I know that's incredibly girly but I don't care because I am happy and he is a teddy bear, therefore, he needed it.  That's right, needed.  I scrapped off his car and waiting until he got out of work and he saw the poster on his windshield and the bag hanging on his mirror.  Fantastic.....he is.  Then we went to his house and sat on the couch together.  We enjoy each others company like no other.  Mark is coming to the neighborhood Christmas party tomorrow.  I'm pumped.  I told him he has to come so I can show him off....he's my trophy boyfriend!  Hahahah.  Just kidding...not really...  

Can I just say that there is a lot of snow on the ground!  Like whoa.

I work tonight, 2:30-11...wish me luck.  Hopefully we are slow because of the snow.  Crossing my fingers that's for sure."

"event","Well my friends...the end of the semester is rapidly approaching.  Yippee, hooray.  You have no idea.  I wish that I could just not go to school and just end up with a degree.  Dang I wish it worked that way.  I signed up for Winter classes today, you could say I procrastinate on that one.  I ended signing up for 12 credits worth of crap.  

My schedule as follows:
Monday/ Wednesday/ Friday

8-9:07      Music Theory
9:20-10:37  Writing 
10:40-11:47 Microeconomics

Tuesday/ Thursday

Work
Work
and more work.

Hopefully I will be able to do earlier shifts on MWF since I get out at noon....crossing my fingers on that one.

I work tonight and I surprising not really looking forward to it.  Work hasn't been as fun as usual...  Oh well.  Life will go on.  

I am getting a hair cut on Wednesday.  I'm ready for a change....I wonder.  Maybe I'll tell her to shave it all off.  No,  I won't.  Maybe it will be different, but probably not.

There is this beautiful baby at my church...her name is Brooklyn.  I love her.  She's like 10 months old.  When she was born, her intestines were out of her body.  She is deaf and was born with a disease to cause her tongue to be too big for her mouth.  She's had 5 major surgeries since she's been alive.  This little baby is a fighter, for real.  I held her at church and she fell asleep in my arms.....ahhh....  Out like a light.  She's deaf and didn't have her hearing aids in....so I was singing to her.  I know you may think it's silly to sing to someone who can't hear, but I know that she could feel the vibrations in my chest as I was singing, and I seriously wanted to cry.  Not because I felt bad, but because when I was singing, it is so precious how music can touch people, whether they can hear or not.  It is beautiful.

That makes me so excited to be a mom.  The gift of bringing a life into the world, amazing.  Seriously.  I am pumped!

Today is going to be a great day....just like yesterday...and the day before...and the day before....  Ahhh...."

It well I guess, not exactly the most entertaining song to sing, but apparently it was easy listening.  I went to breakfast with the ladies inbetween services.  Got to see my wonderfully amazing boyfriend.  He makes me feel so good, you guys don't even understand.  It's crazy.  Always telling me how happy he is to be with me.  Dang, I'm lucky.  I have honestly been blessed by God with Mark.  He's a blessing in every shape and form.....ahhhh.....  When I got home I spent some time watching the Lions game and then I took a nap.  Those two things could only go in that order.  When I woke up, Noelle my bell and I hung out.  Chinese food and Dairy Queen....amazing I tell you.  I love that girl to pieces....and Pam, I wish you could have been there.  Two and a half weeks and you will be home for good...well, actually for Christmas break...either way I'm excited to see you.  I think it's time to warm up the left overs, take a shower, and go to bed....  It's only 10, I'm a loser."

"event","Seriously.  Mark and I went to a concert on Tuesday evening with the youth group.  A married couple and Mark and I were the adult chaperons.  That's weird.....to be an adult.  That concert was pretty great, but what is even better is mine and Mark's relationship.  He is always doing what he can do to make sure I am comfortable and happy.  It's crazy.  I guess you could say that I'm rather picky, and I have incredibly high expectations for my boyfriends, and he is honestly meeting all of them and more with ease.  After the concert, I told him thank you.  I thanked him because he's making me so happy all the time.  Floaty happy.  He said it's the least he can do.  That he wants to show me how he feels and wants to give me what I deserve.  HOLY CRAP.  That's all I have to say!  How in the world did I luck out so well?  Last night we led worship together for the teens.  I love doing that....I love it when he's playing guitar and we sing together.  Even though I could listen to just him all day long.  He's amazing.  After church we decided to hang out with my family.  We went up to the friendly Vg's in Davison to pick up a few things and had a riot....  I loved it.  Then we came back to my house and watched TV and talked with the family.  My parents went to bed and Mark and I sat on the couch just spending time together and talking about things.  He holds me like it's going out of style.  I love that.  2 am strolls around.......I have to wake up at 5:30.  Oh well, because I would rather be sleepy the next day and get to spend time with him.  We were hugging goodbye....he hugs me tight.  I hate having to let go, but I did.  When I did, he grabbed my face, and we kissed.  It was great.  Correction.  REALLY great.  I can't believe how everything is going so well."

Which I loved because I have always had Thanksgiving just at my house with my immediate family.  We went and saw the movie 'Just Friends'.  Don't see it, wait until you can rent it and then, maybe watch it.  It wasn't that great and it definitely wasn't PG.  Overall, my thanksgiving was one of the best ones I've ever had.  No lie.

"event","I was out (and in) drinking yesterday, and i think i might be a little hung over.
Also, i arranged a furmeet. And like.... five people are coming. I had a better plan but it went broke :( I sure do suck at planning.
Anyways, just wanted to let people know i'm still alive.
We had internets for 3 days and then they took it back because apparently we hadn't paid a bill... FROM THE TIME IT DIDN'T WORK. Assholes.
Anyways... hoping to get another job (i deliver crap mail to our nearby houses twice a month. Fucking great..) so i could pay my bills and not go to jail and get gangraped by ugly women.
*sigh*
Looking for a job would be easier if i had the internetty stuff, but i need a job to pay for internetty stuff :(

My tummy hurts."

"event","..i sit in front of this here computer. I'm at school, but i'm leaving on the next bus. We have photography today, but no-one bothered to tell me it's INDEPENDENT photography, meaning WE DO IT AT HOME. I'm so pissed right now!
I had a fight with Markus this morning because i blamed him for making me miss the bus.. and during that fight he said something really nasty and i ran out, but before that i kicked my leg on a chair and it hurts like hell, even still...
And yeah, since i missed my first bus i was too early in lahti for the second bus, but too late for the first one... so i sat there for almost an hour waiting for the next one. And stood.
It was raining a little when i got on the bus, but when i got OFF the bus it was like the sky was falling. Nature had suddenly decided i needed a shower, real bad.
I'm soaked. My coat is heavy from the water and my shoes hold more water than a pair of small fishbowls... and when i finally get here.. i don't find my class. I don't find my teacher for today..
And someone else tells me we're supposed to take the photos at home. On our free time.

...
And i can't go home yet because i don't feel like arguing with Markus... I'll be going to the library then :P And i'm hungry as hell.."

"event","Waaaa...
I had the longest weekend ever...
It was so tiring i'm actually GLAD i got back to work ,_, We went to see Markus's parents again. His brother lives there too now, because his girlfriend dumped him :(
It was cold and rainy all weekend and the sun hardly got out :( I had to babysit Lauri, the 4-year old kid who was also the reason for us to be there. It was his birthday and stuff.. I also got to hold and play with Lauri's younger brother, Jarkko-Olavi (or J-O). He was nice and wasn't at all afraid of me :3 He's only 7 months old and his hands are so tiny and he makes the cutest sounds... But Lauri was like a little MONSTER. He wouldn't behave for ONE MOMENT, he was hurting me all of th e time and was being obnoxiously loud. He wasn't like that when we last met him :( I think it's because he doesn't go to a daycare-place, his mom raises them both at home. He doesn't understand that no matter who it is, you have to respect older people. Also, at that age boys are uncontrollable... And when you're not even part of the family, you can't just go and scold the little bastard.

Hum hum... today i visited my old school, and not just for fun. I'm trying to get back there so i can finish those damn studies. I showed them some of my works, both work-related and freetime-drawings. They seemed pleased and it looks good for me. Most likely i'm going to start my studies this fall, but it'll be tough and they'll only give me one chance so if i screw up, it's going to go down in flames. I was a little nervous and it made my stomch act up again, so it's burning again and FOUL AIR IS COMING OUT OF ME! .....from my mouth, luckily.. I'm eatin g crackers and hoping it will soon stop, because it's not very pleasant ._. It kinda hurts and it tastes bad -_- If it gets worse, it could make me throw up ;_;

But things don't suck, even if i've made it sound like that. It's soon my payday and we also have a lot of new games to play and..*sigh*..Yeah, everything's allright. I just wish days weren't so short so i'd have time to talk with my friends and i wish i wasn't so lazy and i wish we had more money and...
I wish the people that mean a lot to me would all be close to me.
I do get kinda lonely, spending all my time with Markus. But it's not so often, and it's not that bad.. so i have a bad habit of ignoring my friends.
I do love you all."

I wonder what i'll be doing next...
I'm feeling a little anxious (if that's the right word, damn english..) because by thursday i need to have gotten myself a jobtraining place. Like...almost like a job, but i'm training there. And this place would be paying me my normal pay. I'm a little stressed >_> I already asked like two dozen places.. And they said NO. Now i'm supposed to go through all that again. *Shivers* I freeze whenever i think of calling some strange person and asking for a job.

...phoooh...
Just got a new job. Going to have to update an enviroment-week flyer :P
Wish me luck, this is going to be boring..."

"event","I'm bored and inspired (but not able to draw) and sort of finished with my work and just...waiting. I'm not even trying to look like i'm working. She-beast suggested i try a few changes on a background i made for a flyer, but i realized i didn't have a psd-version of it, so all the little pieces are on one layer, so i'd have to work extra to change it. I decided not to. I made the necessary changes already (tiny pictures of people) and am now waiting for her to return so i can show her that ""look, look, i'm finished!"".
I want to draw wolves and canine-characters in general and sabretooth tigers. Why? I saw this girl's dA-gallery with a comic telling about them and saw some other drawings from her and the character sheets for her wolf-chars were very inspiring.
But every time i've started creating my own canine nonmoprhic characters, i feel like.. it's not my own thing. It doesn't feel like copying, really, but it just isn't me. Also, i don't feel like i know their anatomy well enough yet.
Maybe i just should, again, start drawing them, create my own style and make it look good.
Every time i DO draw dogs, they're usually born out of boredom, therefore being ""soulless"", as i say. I want them to have meaning. I don't want to draw... empty things.
I want my creations to live. They're not just...for display.
Here i am again, rambling...
...
i've wanted to say that for a long time x3... rambling... x3"

"event","Today i've been mostly working <3 I'm PROUD of myself. I got some...stuffs done, and it eased my burden that the one poster thing i was supposed to do..well, she-beast did it. I was sick last week and she did it, haha. She was also sick with the same thing i was, and today one of my co-workers is sick because of that too. Haha, maybe now she believes me (she seemed a little sceptical to me...).
She-beast was pretty nice to me today. Maybe she now understands that i wasn't away from work just so i wouldn't have to do anything. It was horrible, i tell ya ,_, But now i'm ok n_n I feel so much better...
Also...
WE HAVE A DOG NOW.
It's not a new dog, it's not a young dog.. but it's my old old dog ^^ She's dump and she stinks a little and she's not all that pretty, but she's very dear to me. She's doing ok, i guess, because she seems happy. I suppose it's better here than back at my old home... i do think she gets lonely tho, when we're not at home. She howls too, and that sucks because we don't want people complaining :/
Hum hum... My easter was. Nothing happened, it just was :D Also, we're NOT running out of money atm and it's good...<3
But still, Markus needs to get a job! *shakes fist at people who won't give him work*
Give him work, dammit!
Also! I sold my soul to advertisements, as some of you might notice.... But i get something nice in return! I get to upload pictures! (Like i don't do it with photobucket already, but the more places, the better...).
There's something for ansreik there~... *hint hint*
Also, i feel bad that..EVERYTHING seems to happen on the 22nd. Ansreiks partyish-thing, Markus's friend's visit, his brother's move(moving? uh..stuff.. thing..), paying the inturnat bill, the allnighter of our anime club... i have too many things happening and still i don't get much choises, because Markus sold me as a slave -> he promised we'd help his brother with his..move...thing.. And also his friend is coming over, and i just wonder how he's gonna make it all work :(
I can't meet Ansreik after all ,_,
It sucks...
I want to seeee heeer~.... T_T
When i finally had the chance.... -_-

It was in a folder with all the other pictures i got from my boss's computer, with young people standing around, and doing stuff like painting and so on.. I was supposed to pick a few for the poster-thing-whatever i'm doing atm, and...thisk inda caught my eye. Who took this picture and WHY was it there? :D In one of these pictures (there were many from the same place as this) i saw my boss, the she-beast too. Was SHE aware of what he was looking at? :D

WHY WAS THIS PICTURE AMONG THE ONES I WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK ON?!

Just today i've drawn two pretty nice unicorn-boys, the other's Pallu, the other one is just a random, muscled (or well-formed) unicorn guy with a nice butt <3

"event","My morning started well, i decided to leave on the later bus (meaming i would be late, but i wanted to lie in bed for a bit longer) and i thought i'd miss it too, because i left 4 minutes later than i should have, but i was well in time (because the buses are always late in the winter, it would seem) and i got here before the bosses... So they don't know i was late n_n
It was difficult to leave my warm bed and Markus, but i also noticed that my tummy had shrunk! I tried on my lovely punkish pants and they fit again n_n Not as well as they could, but i'm not done dieting anyways :3
Also, i'm not as exhausted walking up hills anymore ^^
Now that i know it's WORKING, and i have proof of it, i feel it's worth continuing :3"

"event","This job is so demanding... I haven't really had the time to update my journal because i've been so busy.. and at home i can only use the computer a little at a time, because i have to share it. And i have to make sure Markus isn't bored or.. something :P And he doesn't like it when i talk to people on msn so i have't really done that.. But it has to stop. I need to be in contact with my friends and I miss everyone. Feels like the only way to communicate with my friends is through their galleries or livejournal-accounts, and that's WRONG. Today Markus has a  day off, he's sick, so i can use to computer when i get home, because he'll be home al day with internets and nothing else to worry about (well, only the cleaning that has to be done around the house, but i told him not to worry about it too much). The good thing is that i can talk to him while he's on irc...

I dyed my hair on sunday. It's more of a reddish brown now and i like it allright. The colour didn't quite match my expectations, because i didn't use the same colour from the same people this time. This package had these crappy ""rubber gloves""...that were made of thin plastic and they suck suck SUCK! Also the colour smelled a lot more than the one i'm used to using.

Hum hum.. We might be going to a cruise. I said we MIGHT! But i hope we do.. It would be so lovely, i love ships n_n ....And i love tax free shopping x3

I drew a sphinx-natu, but it doesn't matter because i'm going to lose it somewhere in a HUEG pile of paper before i find a cable for my printer (yes, it's ooooooold and no one of those you can just plug in your usb-port ,_,).

Well, that's all i have to say this time."

Even tho i'vey found out that eating and drinking only salmiac and energy drinks is a BAD thing... my breakfast was (not including the rice crispies i had before i left for work) or more like still is (taking my time~..) salmiac... and a can of Battery ^^; I know my tummy will be upset.. but only if that's all i'm going to have today. So i'll just have to eat a _healthy_, high-fiber lunch today, ohnoes >_>
Humhumhum. 
I finished my work yesterday, and did it pretty well.. but it was a bit too late, 1 hour past the deadline, so the price was raiced 10% >_> Oops ^^; I'm glad the she-beast wasn't at work that day, because she'd had said something mean, but my other boss, the nice man who speaks quietly (sometimes i can't hear anything he says but still he always makes his message clear, so i never ask him to speak louder... i'd have to do it all the time if i did), was all nice and friendly and he taught me how to use the fax machine n_n He made me feel good about myself, because he accepted the work as it was, there was only one thing i forgot and he mentioned it, but he didn't say anything about changing the font or..stuff. 
I like him a lot more... so it's a shame the she-beast came to work today :( I'll have to deal with her about the work around here (she's responsible for the graphic design here, while the quiet man is responsible for the web-stuff).
We'll see what work they'll give me today. I THINK i finished the envelope job they gave me yesterday well enough.. i might as well check.
Until later!
Explosive energy! Raaah! Today shall be good!"

"event","My evil boss is gone for today... She's sick, or something.. And i'm just glad. I don't have to see her face and hear her mocking me or aking stupid question or suggesting i change the font in document x to something else, just because the webpage has the same font (it doesn't make it any better, y'know. i don't want my ad to look silly..)..
I feel a bit dull today. Yesterday was such a pain in the ass (in short, i got into trouble because of a stupid white lie and because the she beast didn't respect my privacy) and the evening wasn't much better. I got home with Markus, we ate and watched dr. Phil, did unmentionable things, took a shower and went to sleep. Also, i felt fat yesterday. I know i have a bit of a tummy and i need to get it off me, but i don't like feeling fat. Because i'm not. Just a little chubby, tha'ss all...
I got my pay but it was only ~870. This job sucks. (No it doesn't...) Marku's new job is t3h suck. (Yes, it is.) He has to wake up at 5 am because his work starts at 7 am in a faraway place (well, not all that far, i think it's somewhere around 15 km). He gets off an hour before i do, but it still doesn't leave us much free time - and today's the anime club's meeting.
I've scribbled my work papers (mostly the backsides, but any free space will do) with antrho- and manga faces.. and eyes.. and then just pure randomness, like pacman-natu eating tiny Dinos.
...
Yeah...
I also got a huge craving for salmiac and after eating a lot of it.. i can't taste much else.."

"event","..That's my dad alright. Today's his birthday and i called him a while ago.. He didn't sound too happy, but it sounded like there was a party on the background. Or, more like, he was in a bar, getting drunk. He didn't sound all that drunk which was kinda.. surprising, considering the tme of day and everything.. I couldn't hear most of what he said (or might have said, i don't know because the bg-noise was so loud..) and the connection wasn't so great either. I told him i'd visit him some weekend but still he didn't sound happy, or even interested. I decided to end the phonecall because it was a little frustrating and said ""I love you"" with no real response or any sign of emotion from him. I wonder if there was something bothering him. Maybe he was tired, or more drunk that he sounded (usually it can be heard quite easily..).
The phonecall left me feeling.. dull and empty. I then asked Markus, who had come to visit me at my work (more like he sits on the public computer in the other room and we chat a little and he plays AQ and every now and then i go over there and we hug or something..) that was it ok if we visited him the next weekend (i get my moneys next week) and he said ""no, It's not ok"" and.. i felt all bleh and left and.. yeah..
I finished my work today too.. so.. i'm bored.. and all bleh... and I'm meeting Dino today, just the two of us (i hope she understands the concept of ""just the two of us"" and isn't gonna bring her friends with her this time...).
I've been eating salmiac all day, because i bought a bag at the store when a huge craving struck me.
Hm.. today's been boring.."

"event","..I just ate myself full. My mom bought me lunch (she has this week off, so she's spending her time relaxing...). She was in town and asked me when my lunch break is and invited me and Markus to eat lunch with her, so we went to ""Manhattan Steak House"". It was pretty expensive there, but mom said it was ok, so i ate a pepper steak with garlic potatoes and had some cola to drink..
She told me then that she's having an internet affair >_> It's a called Patrick and he lives in chicago and he's part indian and he's very tall <_<
...I don't like the idea of her moving to Chicago, like she suggested might happen >_> But i _DO_ like the idea of her leaving my stepdad. Guess she didn't love him all thatm uch (which is no surprise, he's an asshole). And of course i'm a little worried. What if this Patrick (aka Stormreaver) is EVILS! Of course i want to protect my mom... But i'd really be happy if she left that worthless scumbag. He's made my life a living hell.
..I don't even feel bad at all, saying these things. He doesn't deserve it."

I have nothing to do again. Just like yesterday. But yesterday i was an hour late, so the work i was supposed to finish was finished by someone else... i feel a bit guilty... And i had an interview too. They want to know my strong points, my future plans and ambitions... They suggested that when i have free time, i should be gathering material for my portfolio (i've never done one before) or read books about how to programs work... so today i grabbed ""How to use Freehand"" because i kinda want to get to know the program better. You know, so that our relationship can advance to the next stage. (wutufuc?)
I'm also spending my time downloading new stepmania songs, and old ones to replace the ones that got wiped some time ago.
Bleh... i don't feel like writing anymore >_<

"event","Ok, my horrendous backproblems are back. They started 10 months ago when i hurt my back riding my bicycle (i'm not all that fit and i was trying too hard). It was T3H killer in the summer but when i started school it got better, because i had to walk from the marketplace to the school (well, i DID take the bus to go to the marketplace, but i lived at my mom's back then) and now it's started to hurt again because i've stayed indoors and just recently started a job that is basically just sitting (well, computer work, duh).
But enough of that.
I was at a party last friday, with the people from my anime club. We had a lot of fun and i drank some (well, i didn't even get all that drunk) and then we went to sleep at Dino's place (she's such a lovely girl but she thinks she's a dinosaur-alien...). The next day we went to this youth activity center (no the one i'm working in >_>) that's a regular place for our allnighters. We watched anime, played stepmania on Xbox (oh, the possibilities~), went to the sauna and so on. The only crappy things were my back and Markus's foul mood (he can be such an angsty little baby sometimes >_<).
Because my back went crappy pretty early, we had to cancel the D&D-game we had planned for the night and that seemed to piss our DM off. When i talked to him in the morning, he said it didn't really bother him, because then he had had more time to spend with Dino (wooo~ooooo~  ;3).
We got back home yesterday and it was still pretty early, so i started playing Heroes 3 but i lost to a silly frenchman. It was a map Markus had created for me and it had a lot of (well, some, at least) jokes about The Holy Grail (the game has some in it itself, in the form of codes...) and French was my main enemy. There was also this gay bandit called Lucifiano. Yeah, i know,. Lucifiano...
Anyhoo, now i'm back at work and bored, because it seems the info i need to finish the invitation i've been working all (with all these zippers <3) isn't...here yet. Or something. It's not my problem, it's the clients, and if i don't get all the things i need to work, it can't be helped.
And btw, i had an argument with Markus this morning and i just might not go staight home just to piss him off more.
I' such an evil bitch.
But he started it!
I'm telling!

Yeah, i'll stop >_<"

"event","...that's the first line of the first chapter of my first story in a long time. I started writing it the other afternoon at work because i was so damn bored.. Yesterday, two hours before i got off i got some work.. but at that point i was already so tired, bored, hungry and..well, dead, that i couldn't do anything. I'm supposed to design an invitation to a.. conference or something. But i'm feeling not at all creative, how am i supposed to get anything done? I'm glad i have time until monday.. so that means today, tomorrow and maybe monday.
But working with an empty stomach sure is a pain in the ass.. I ate my packed lunch already and i can't afford to buy anything T_T But i could...go and order a soda with my cell... and i think that's just what i'll do.
*a moment later, hugging her bottles of Coke and Fanta Groovy Apple*
I don't envy the people going to this conference, after reading the program... It all sounds so boring and they use these complicated, long words for simple things..
...
I've been trying to get some ideas for the past 5 hours, but how am i gonna just pull something out of my ass without any friggin' guidelines? Only 'bout 25 minutes 'till i have to show my boss what ideas i've come up with so far... and i've got nothing."

"event","Ok, so right now, we officially have something like 3 euros. It should be Markus's payday, but they might pay him the NEXT monday. My payday should be the last day of the month and that's tomorrow.I'm very hungry. I'm comforting myself with the pretzels i left here on thursday and i have two slices of rye bread in my pocket (wrapped in stuffs, of course). Today seems to have a slow start again. It's quiet and i think only the boss has any work to do. Today i took with me a D&D book, Races of the Dragons, it should keep me entertained for a while. I also thought of drawing the characters of a story i created (well, not the story, just the basic idea) about these two rivaling tribes. The other one's Animalis, the other was Mashina or something. I know, it's far from original.. Anyway, the Animalis (the good guys) are blessed with the ability to transform into animals and into a half-form, while Mashina is blessed with the intelligence to create machines and they use their technology to simulate Animalis's ability.
Why this is my current project is because i remembered the story one day and needed to get the original texts for it, but they were back at my mom's. When we went to fix mom's computer one weekend, i made sure to get it on my flash stick. I then read it when back home and realized i really COULD write back then, because it didn't make me feel embarrased, it actually _inspired_ me. 
I then sketched one of the characters, Raven (i know, originality..) and it turned out quite well. I inked (some of) it yesterday and then decided i might want to add in the story these random creature-ideas that have been popping into my mind lately. Those ideas include Unihorn (because we were wondering ""why uniCORN?""), Oval-lizard (it's face is an oval yin-yang), Dracotaur (half human, half dragon..), this wolf thing from a magic card..(it's red, with a dark O on it's back and another one around the tip of it's tail.. he's still unnamed) and... hm.. well, i guess that WAS the end of my list. If i had any more creature-ideas, i've forgotten them.
Anywaaaays... if i don't get any work soon, i'll start drawing my ideas of the characters and maybe the creatures too.
Just please... save me from boredom and hunger... -_-
Over and out."

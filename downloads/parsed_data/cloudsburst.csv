Oh gosh! I'm feeling so down down down now~ cause&nbsp;i'm still very upset that i'm not in the same CDS class as the girls. They are all the in same class except me. I'm the odd ball now.&nbsp;Dang.&nbsp;Not only that , there is quite a few 02 peeps in the same CDS as them! making me feel even more lousy. and plus i still cannot find anyone taking the same CDS as me. That is so....... :(

Good thing i still have Pris ci ci la la in the same class as me! :)&nbsp;Poor you! you still have to tolerate my&nbsp;________(fill in the blank yourself) laughter. &nbsp;But it's a good thing actually. I can make you smile everyday. Hee.

Alright done. Be back soon."

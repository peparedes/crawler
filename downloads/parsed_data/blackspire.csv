So far this is gonna cost me about $100 out of my own pocket. Lower if I can borrow a holster for my airsoft pistol from David, or somebody else if he doesn't have one. That reminds me, <a href=""www.redwolfairsoft.com"" target=""_new"">this</a> website doesn't tell you how much shipping will cost until <i>after</i> you have promiised to pay them. I knew that international shipping from Japan would be expensive, but i didn't think it would more than double the cost of the gun+holster+bbs+loading tool. So make sure that you know what you're getting before you buy from them. So I have canceld that order (I use this term loosely, I really am just not gonna pay them for the 5 days they say they will hold your order for) and i am now going to go with plan 'B': get an awesome airsoft rifle from another company (the same one that sold me my $4 PPK gun, which is surprisingly accurate) for about 2/3 what it would cost to get a lower quality pistol from Japan. But now I don't get both... Fuck it, that pistol wasn't worth $82. The Plan B gun, totally worth the $70 its gonna cost to get it shipped here. I may get a scope for it, sense I'm not gonna be spending money on another pistol... Oh well, I'll figure out something."

"event","So my friend and I started a production company. So now we're making our first movie. It has no title yet, but we'll keep whoever the hell it is that cares up to date by posting here.

So the movie is about a guy from some sort of government agency that deals with top secret information, as of yet we haven't decided on an organization. But the secret agent is entrusted with a disk cleverly disguised as a video game. The video game look-alike is kept in the man's media cabinet with his other video games and movies and such in his house. Then a year later, the man moves, and accidentally leaves the ""game"" disk at his old house. He realizes this as soon as he settles into his new house and has the urge to play video games. he finds his box of games and starts to un-pack, only to find that his most valuable one is missing. Immediately preparations start for getting back the disk.

This is very loosely based on my own experiences. I lost a great game in a move along with more than 3 years of game progress on my only memory card. For some reason it reminds me of this Penny Arcade comic (which is at the following url:http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-10-31&res=l, yeah i know.)

My friend David and I decided to make this movie because of some advice he had given me on getting back my game and memory card. The conversation went something like this:

Me: I lost my memory card and Vice City.
David: Schiess.
Me: Yeah.
David: Where?
Me: My old house, I think I accidentally left it there.
David: You should dress up like a guy from the CIA and go make the people who live there now think you have a warrant to search the house.
Me: Yeah. That would be fun to do. Let's make a movie where we get to do that.
David: OK."

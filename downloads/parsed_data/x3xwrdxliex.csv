"event","its been like forever since i actually wrote in this. but thats cool. because im cool. and cool people just do that.

im really psyched about this upcomming event with amber. we're going to go see eighteen visions, along with other 'cool' bands. because like i said. im cool and ambers cool. so were just two cool people. so when we're together..thats like..total coolness.

yeah, i haven't really been to a show in like forever. because..well actually.. i dont know why. but i guess thats just swell.

Guess what..33 days until my birthday, bitches. so i guess im excited about that, except the fact that im not doing anything for my birthday because i dont really feel like it. + last birthday was gay.

My dads in jail again. for like the 3rd time within 2 months. because he's a low-life. but i guess thats just marvelous. i've gotten kinda used to the fact tht he totally and utterly sucks. but thats alright, because so do i. must run in the family. 

but i guess im done writing because like 45753 people are talking to me and its too much of a hassle.

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=1>Last night my mother was out with her boyfriend for the whole time. so me of course, invites a few people over. but, nikki invited two people over who was pissinge everyone off..literally..so we had to have my brother make one of them leave cuz he refused. what a douche. so after a while, me and this kid sat at the the little table in my living room with some wonderful O.J. and Popov. We were really the only ones drinking it cuz everyone else had beer. After awhile, they wouldnt let me drink anymore cuz they said ill be out of it. so them dumbasses emptied out 2 'full' bottles of Corona on me. <BR>assholes.<BR>then around quarter-after one, two kids had to go home. but, one of them stole their dad's truck and came back. Woo..then about an hour and a half later everyone had to start getting home. So i went outside and i guess Morgan and them thought i was gonna like..run away or something. So it took me a while to get out there and give 'em all hugs goodbye. Somebody picked me up and carried me back in the house but im not quite sure which kid did it.. :S .. when they all left, my brother made me lay down and go to sleep. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#ffccff>xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>Then, approximately 5 minutes later, i went to go smack her fer f*in up my hair. bad move. while i went to hit her, she flinched..putting the scissors in the path of my raging hand. causing my&nbsp; palm to rest upon the scissor blade, slicing into my flesh. it began to bleed..continuously..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff>xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>""Then"", while we were on our journey to emma's house to have her mother attempt to save my hair, i happened to waltz into 3 humongous puddles of water. in a row. However, it was dark out so i couldnt see nothing..so my bottlecap decides to detatch from my grip, falling to the ground where i could not find it again.</FONT></P>

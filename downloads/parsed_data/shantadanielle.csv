You walked into French class not so long ago, looking very, very fine and taking quite afew of our breaths away. I assumed straight away that you were going to be an arrogant jock, too good-looking for his own good, but you ended up being all of the opposite. There are so few guys who have been quite so considerate, charming and caring as you have been, yet many have on first glance misunderstood you for someone quite different. We've had some good times together, you and I. I don't think I will ever forget our drunken afternoon misadventure into French class, nor finding you still asleep in my room, ten hours after I'd left you last, curled up with Corn dog, one arm full of pig chop marks care of Eva. You were such an intelligent boy, and we always had great conversations. You always made me laugh, it was very easy to make me smile. Yet somehow, there was always a part of you that remained sad, that kept you in the dark, and from time to time it took you away from us. It wasn't always easy to understand, but you always came back. Going away for good was never part of the bargain. 

I am in Paris now, and just this morning, I was thinking of you and how much you loved this city. It's so beauiful, and I can finally understand why you had so much affection for this place, why it was here that you felt free and happy. Yet now, for me, Paris will also always be the place where you broke my heart. Hours later, I'm still reeling from that call, the pieces have yet to glue themselves together, my eyes have yet to dry. Too many things today have served as a constant reminder of the fact that you are no longer here. From that wine and cheese basket that looked so much like the one you and Eva made for my birthday, to the little stuffed crocodile a kid was carrying in her pram, which reminded me of the 'hall-warming' present that I bought for you. Not to mention the very face that it was you who sat down with me and helped me plan my french adventure. 

It is so hard to come to terms with this, and cliched as it is, there is nothing I wouldn't give to wake up tomorrow and find that this has all been a bad dream, and that you are live and well, and that I will see you when I return. You sounded happier, more hopeful in the last message you sent me. I wish you had held on, Eli. There is a sense of helplessness, being so far away from our friends at a time like this. I want that one last chance to see you, to laugh with you, to tell you that I'm here for you, whatever comes your way. I am sorry that there were times where I was afraid of your darkness, and stayed away because I didn't know what else I could do to help. I wish I could have been stronger for you. There is nothing I can do but feel the pain of your loss, cling on to the memories we've had together, and pray that wherever you are, you are happy and that you have been released from the chains that held you down in this life.

Goodbye Eli. Till we meet again."

"event","Hello,God! Aren't you just a little ball of sunshine!
They say you make trees grow and rainbows glow across the skies
It's you who get the birds to chirp and make people love with happy sighs.
But when children die and people cry, oh no, that's not from up above!
How dare you say it's caused, by the God, the Man or Dove?
They say you are omnipotent and very wholly good,
yet then how can you not remove the things that spoil the mood?
When bombs go off and blood is shed, I attribute to you,
Just like the flowers and the rabbits, but they say I have no clue. 
They say you love the little children, yet it seems you are quite picky,
The little black ones, not so much, oh God, you are so finicky.
For untold reasons they believe that you talk to them,
instructing them on what is true, it makes them feel so glam. 
It's funny how they praise you for the moon and sky, 
They call you almighty and powerful, if you want you'd make us fly.
Yet when it comes to evil, no, you're not to be blamed, 
You're omnipotent yes, but you do not rule over all the game. 
They say that evil is necessary to realise the good,
But Powerful God, without evil we would not know what it was, head or foot.
Last of all, I have to say, it's all very, very strange,
for when I said I had an invisible friend, they said I was deranged."

"event","Dear Papa, 

It's been five days since you left us, since that morning when I got that call. By the time I rushed to the hospital, you were gone. I knew it the moment I saw Mom's tear-stained face in the hallway. I went in to see you and I took hold of your hand and squeezed it, praying with all my might that you would squeeze back, but you never did. It happened all too soon, so suddenly. 

Just the day before, we were on the phone having one of our usual conversations. It'd been awhile since our last one because I'd been so busy in school and hardly been at home. I thought it was strange for you to have called persistently to talk to me, because usually I'm the one that calls. I never realised until you left and I don't know if you consciously knew it, but I think you were trying to say goodbye. I can't be more grateful for that last call, Papa, because I remember everything we talked about and those, along with so many others, are memories I will cherish for the rest of my life.

It's so hard to understand how you could be gone. You have always been such a constant in my life, pouring over the papers and whistling merrily. How I will miss that whistle of yours. How I will miss the packets of Yakult you used to bring every time you came. Your jokes, your cheery laughter and your smile. 

I know how much you loved me, and I'm sure you know how much I loved you. Everytime I thought of you, and even now, I smile because you were one person I held with so much affection and someone I kept so dear to my heart. This is the first time anyone I have truly loved and had a close and loving relationship with has died, and you were seventy-five, I've always known at some point you would leave. I just didn't think it would be now, because you were still so young and you weren't even sick. You looked so strong till the day you went away, and I wanted you to be at my wedding, to hold your first great-grandniece or nephew. I didn't think it would be this soon. 

Yet I am glad in a way, that you went the way you did. It was quick and painless, and I will never be haunted by memories of you hooked up to machines and looking like death days before it was your time. Like this, I can always hold on to the more beautiful memories of you. My Papa, the sweet, beautiful, kind, giving and loving man. The one I adored with all my heart, the one who cheered me up, the one who was always proud of me. 

I miss you so much, knowing that at every family get-together, every birthday and every Christmas, you will not be the first one to arrive. I will never get another card addressed to ""Dearest, Darling Shanta"". I will never get to buy you another birthday or Christmas present, or give you money from my first pay. I will never get to hug you or give you another kiss again. I will never get to hear about the new comedies you've been watching on cable. Our family misses you so much. There is something missing without you there, because since my grandparents died when our parents were children, you have been there all the way, taking care of us and giving everything to this family. I hope you are proud of us, for staying strong and sticking together. We wouldn't be the close family we are today if not for you and that is the greatest gift you have given everyone. 

Gone too soon, but I thank God for the beautiful 18 years I've had of you. The pain is so real but there is comfort in knowing that you are in a better place, a place you truly deserve. 

love,
your dearest, darling Shan

It's time to let you go,
It's time to say goodbye.
There's no more excuses,
No more tears to cry.
There's been so many changes, 
But it's so hard to let you go now.
All that could have been,
I'll always have the memories. 
Fate has a way of changing,
Just when you don't want it to. 

I'll be okay.
Life passes so quickly,
You gotta take the time
Or you'll miss what really matters,
You'll miss all the signs.
I've spent my life searching,
For what was always there.
Sometimes it will be too late.
Sometimes it won't be fair .

I'll be okay.
I won't give up.
I won't give in.
I can't recreate what just might have been.
I know that my heart will find love again.
Now is the time to begin .

I'll really miss you all,
but I'll be okay."

12. Aron
13. Sophia
14. Stephanie
15. Rathika


so what do you think of number 4?
She's a grumpy Godsend. I'm not quite sure what I'd have done without her in school, but boy is she a damn Grinch. Together we make the gossip queens on Temasek.

how would you feel if number 2 slapped your face?
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.

on the scale of 1 to 10, how good looking do u think number 6 is?
Cheeks? I used to tell him he reminded me of a goat with bum fluff on his chin, just to get him to shave, but really, he looks pretty alright.Such a sweet face. You'd know he's a kind boy. haha. 6.

how nice is number 8?
I love her to bits. 

honestly, if number 9 met an accident, what would you do?
Oh dear. I'd be very worried and I'd go visit him. We hung out with him a decent bit in school. 

would i ever fall for 11?
I am so in love with this boy. With a face like his, how could anyone not? He's a sweetie, but I don't think I could fall for him that way.

what sport would i play with number 12?
tennis. wee!

how much do you like number 3?
I grew up with the boy and we had so much fun getting into trouble with our parents. We were the looney twosome. I wish someone had taped us singing Buring Kaka Tua together.

would 13 and 7 make a good couple?
Li si and Sophia? Perhaps because they're pretty silly in the same way. But they're way too innocent for that kind of thing.

do i hate number 5?
When she goes AWOL on me, which is common. haha. but i do love her still.

would 14 kill me one day?
no, but she certainly drives me nuts sometimes. 

who do i like more? 15 or 10?
I can't choose between Kel and Ra! Kel's my buddy and Ra is my darling! I won't choose.

"event","<b>US envoy slaps Singapore over freedom of speech</b>
By John Burton in Singapore
Financial Times
Updated: 1:42 p.m. ET Oct. 12, 2005

<i>The outgoing US ambassador to Singapore has criticised the city-state's restrictions on free speech in a rare public rebuke by a US official of one of Washington's closest Asian allies.

Ambassador Frank Levin said Singapore's 20th-century political model may prove inadequate for the 21st century, warning that the government ""will pay an increasing price for not allowing full participation of its citizens.""

The ambassador told an audience at a farewell dinner that he was ""embarrassed"" when police asked him if he wanted to press charges against six demonstrators protesting the Iraq war in front of the US embassy in 2003. Singapore bans demonstrations of five or more people.

""I said 'no.' I mean, go ahead, hold the signs and say something if you want to,"" said Mr Lavin, who will become under-secretary for international trade at the US Commerce Department.

Mr Levin said it was ""surprising to find constraints on discussions here"" given Singapore's strong international links in the economic sector. ""In this era of Weblogs and Webcams, how much sense does it make to limit political expression?""

Singapore's one-party political dominance provides ""enormous strengths,"" such as ""very high quality leadership,"" but it also has weaknesses since ""the lack of open and vigorous debates might reduce a government's popularity if it doesn't let ideas or views be properly aired.""

Lee Hsien Loong, the Singapore prime minister, said last week that he did not believe that Singapore should adopt an ""idealised form"" of liberal democracy, explaining it was unsuitable for the country.

US-Singapore ties have strengthened during Mr Lavin's four-year tenure as ambassador, including the signing of bilateral free-trade agreement and a new security framework that might lead to an increased US military presence in the city-state.

Recent US ambassadors to Singapore, including Mr Lavin, have normally been highly supportive in their comments on Singapore. Mr Lavin's predecessor, Steven Green, left his post to become head of a Singapore-listed venture capital fund and was appointed a special advisor to the Singapore government and its honorary consul-general in Miami.

But Patricia Herbold, Mr Lavin's successor, has suggested that the Bush administration might be preparing to take a tougher line on Singapore's human rights record.

Ms Herbold, a lawyer and Republican fundraiser, told a US Senate hearing on her confirmation that she would continue a dialogue that Washington has with Singapore regarding the openness of its society and its political system.

US-Singapore relations have improved steadily since late 1980s, when Singapore accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs by alleging that the US embassy had secretly provided financial support to an opposition politician.

At the time, Singapore relaxed its ban on demonstrations and allowed a large protest rally to take place in front of the US embassy.</i>

Totally agree on the issue of political expression and restrictive practices, but

<i>""the Bush administration might be preparing to take a tougher line on Singapore's human rights record.""</i>

Take a tougher line?? Now that part made me laugh out loud.

There goes the little boy, trying to dip his fingers into everybody elses pies."

"event","<b>Ray Nagin</b> blasts the slow pace of federal and state relief efforts in an expletive-laced interview with local radio station WWL-AM.

<i>The following is a transcript of WWL correspondent Garland Robinette's interview with Nagin on Thursday night. Robinette asked the mayor about his conversation with President Bush:</i>

NAGIN: I told him we had an incredible crisis here and that <b>his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice.</b> And that I have been all around this city, and I am very frustrated because we are not able to marshal resources and we're outmanned in just about every respect.

You know the reason why the looters got out of control? Because we had most of our resources saving people, thousands of people that were stuck in attics, man, old ladies. ... You pull off the doggone ventilator vent and you look down there and they're standing in there in water up to their freaking necks.

And they <b>don't have a clue what's going on down here. They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras, AP reporters, all kind of goddamn -- excuse my French everybody in America, but I am pissed.</b>

...

Now, I will tell you this -- and I give the president some credit on this -- he sent one John Wayne dude down here that can get some stuff done, and his name is [Lt.] Gen. [Russel] Honore.

And he came off the doggone chopper, and he started cussing and people started moving. And he's getting some stuff done.

...

NAGIN: I have no idea what they're doing. But I will tell you this: You know, God is looking down on all this, and if they are not doing everything in their power to save people, they are going to pay the price. Because <b>every day that we delay, people are dying and they're dying by the hundreds, I'm willing to bet you.</b>

...

WWL: Why couldn't they drop the 3,000-pound sandbags or the containers that they were talking about earlier? Was it an engineering feat that just couldn't be done?

NAGIN: ...I flew over that thing yesterday, and it's in the same shape that it was after the storm hit. There is nothing happening. <b>And they're feeding the public a line of bull and they're spinning, and people are dying down here.</b>

WWL: If some of the public called and they're right, that there's a law that the president, that the federal government can't do anything without local or state requests, would you request martial law?

NAGIN: ...And I am telling you right now: They're showing all these reports of people looting and doing all that weird stuff, and they are doing that, but people are desperate and they're trying to find food and water, the majority of them.

Now you got some knuckleheads out there, and they are taking advantage of this lawless -- this situation where, you know, we can't really control it, and they're doing some awful, awful things. But that's a small majority of the people. Most people are looking to try and survive.

And one of the things people -- nobody's talked about this. Drugs flowed in and out of New Orleans and the surrounding metropolitan area so freely it was scary to me, and that's why we were having the escalation in murders. People don't want to talk about this, but I'm going to talk about it.

You have drug addicts that are now walking around this city looking for a fix, and that's the reason why they were breaking in hospitals and drugstores. They're looking for something to take the edge off of their jones, if you will.

And right now, they don't have anything to take the edge off. And they've probably found guns. So what you're seeing is drug-starving crazy addicts, drug addicts, that are wrecking havoc. And we don't have the manpower to adequately deal with it. We can only target certain sections of the city and form a perimeter around them and hope to God that we're not overrun.

WWL: Well, you and I must be in the minority. Because apparently there's a section of our citizenry out there that thinks because of a<b> law that says the federal government can't come in unless requested by the proper people, that everything that's going on to this point has been done as good as it can possibly be.</b>

NAGIN: Really?

WWL: I know you don't feel that way.

NAGIN: <b>Well, did the tsunami victims request? Did it go through a formal process to request?</b>

You know, <b>did the Iraqi people request that we go in there? Did they ask us to go in there? What is more important?</b>

And I'll tell you, man, I'm probably going get in a whole bunch of trouble. I'm probably going to get in so much trouble it ain't even funny. You probably won't even want to deal with me after this interview is over.

WWL: You and I will be in the funny place together.

NAGIN: But <b>we authorized $8 billion to go to Iraq lickety-quick. After 9/11, we gave the president unprecedented powers lickety-quick to take care of New York and other places.

Now, you mean to tell me that a place where most of your oil is coming through, a place that is so unique when you mention New Orleans anywhere around the world, everybody's eyes light up -- you mean to tell me that a place where you probably have thousands of people that have died and thousands more that are dying every day, that we can't figure out a way to authorize the resources that we need? Come on, man.</b>

You know, I'm not one of those drug addicts. I am thinking very clearly.

<b>And I don't know whose problem it is. I don't know whether it's the governor's problem. I don't know whether it's the president's problem, but somebody needs to get their ass on a plane and sit down, the two of them, and figure this out right now.</b>

WWL: What can we do here?

NAGIN: Keep talking about it.

WWL: We'll do that. What else can we do?

NAGIN: Organize people to write letters and make calls to their congressmen, to the president, to the governor. Flood their doggone offices with requests to do something. This is ridiculous.

<b>I don't want to see anybody do anymore goddamn press conferences.</b> Put a moratorium on press conferences. Don't do another press conference until the resources are in this city. And then come down to this city and stand with us when there are military trucks and troops that we can't even count.

Don't tell me 40,000 people are coming here. They're not here. It's too doggone late. Now get off your asses and do something, and let's fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country.

WWL: I'll say it right now, you're the only politician that's called and called for arms like this. And if -- whatever it takes, the governor, president -- whatever law precedent it takes, whatever it takes, I bet that the people listening to you are on your side.

NAGIN: Well, I hope so, Garland. I am just -- <b>I'm at the point now where it don't matter. People are dying. They don't have homes. They don't have jobs. The city of New Orleans will never be the same in this time.</b>"

"event","I'm feeling all stuffy-nosed and disgusting and in no mood to do any work, even though I did promise myself I'd be serious about studying from now on. Didn't go to school this morning. I was planning to, but I could barely talk when I got up. I've been forced off tennis for a week, and it's made my dare utterly miserable. I had a match today for the club's open tornament, but i had to let that go as well, to someone I've beaten flat twice.  Gosh, it sucks to be sick.

Chaired yesterday's debate between RJ and YJ. RJ won, and well,  with all respect, they did deserve to win. YJ's speakers just lacked the clarity of speech that Raffles had. More importantly, TJ's still in the top eight which means that  they've got a confirmed place in the quarters Those damn coat shoes re-blistered the back of my feet. Mr Chung would not resist teasing me, in my plight, about needing to be groomed to wear court shoes. I can hold my heels, thank you very much, but not when they're scraping off your skin with every step you take. Try it, you MAN! Before the debate I saw Peter Pan in the canteen. Oh, I can't help but lust. Dammit, he's just too gorgeous for his own good. He doesn't deserve himself for torturing me so.

oh well.. I should get on with some work then.. I've gotta stick to what I've set out to do, or my tennis goes."

"event","""The United Nations cannot be a panacea.""

I do agree. But after listening to three, hour long debates on whether or not we should applaud the United Nations, I cannot make a full stand on either side. It was plenty of fun  chairing at the National Debates Championships, which out school hosted.(minus the evil court shoes which have painfully blistered my feet) TJ made it to the second round! I'm so happy for them, although I wish I could have watched them debate. Ras gave us specific instructions to keep a 3 metre radius away from their debate room, so I did,  but I would have really loved to see her win best speaker TWICE. I'm so proud of her! Vasudha was absolutly, deliriously mad about the girls winning, and as president, how could anyone expect her not to? If we could make it to the top four next year, I would be on the floor and crying.

 Raffles was absolutly ridiculous in their claim that they were told to prep for two props. Which team ever argues the same side of a debate twice? At a national competition? Surely they've been in debate competitions long enough to know that you always do    have to argue both sides. Trust the smartest to be stupid. I'll cross my fingers for Yishun JC to smack RJ on wednesday. This is surely the year for the underdogs. The long-time winners are becoming too complacent in their positions. 

I'm chairing this one, since it was on my schedule for saturday, but then Raffles pulled their little stunt. I don't fancy Gaya time keeping next to me. She won't leave us alone and it's getting very annoying. I cannot, for the life of me, stand clingy people. Especially when you're not part of the group.  I've been passing rather snide comments in her direction lately. I don't like to be openly mean, but it seriously gets on my nerves. Keep your damn distance! I'm afraid that I'm going to tell it to her face soon. 

I did miserably for my exams. I'm paying the price for procrastination and laziness. But I think I needed the wake up call. I'm already working more consistently than i ever have. I'll have to meet with Mr Fun sometime this week, and probably have tea with the principal. I feel really bad. I know I'm not in a detrimental situation. With effort I know I can repair the situation. But I feel guilty because I've let them down, and they surely question their choosing me for the scholarship. It doesn't help that I'm captain of the team. It's just another doubt they'll have of me. But I suppose there's really nothing I can do right now but to take the blame, accept responsibility and redeem myself by working on pulling my grades up. I will not point fingers and say its the diffucult transition from secondary school to college, or my intensive tennis programme that caused my grades to plunge. I was lazy and that's all there is to it.  They will give me another chance, and I will take it. And I will not let my words go without actions."

"event","I drank a very strong cup of coffee last night, in an attempt to stay with the books till about one am. I highly underestimated the power of that cuppa, cause it kept me up till five. sheesh. Not that the time wasn't well spent, actually. I was lying in bed, wondering what to do at two in the morning, when one's so wide awake that sleeping's not at all an option. My mom's banned me from watching the Euro 04, since the wierd Portuguese timings will ' mess up my study time' and besides, it's no fun watching a soccer match by yourself. And then I hear the TV blare for a few seconds.(something in my dratted TV works up the volume to the max everytime you switch it on) So I go out into the hall and.. noooo.. my dad, who NEVER watches soccer, who would never give up sleep time to watch a game, or any other TV show for that matter, who thinks TV is a bloody waste of time, is right in front of the telly, watching England play Croatia. 
So we have like this conversation.

""YOU! YOU are watching soccer. Of all people, YOU are watching soccer?""

""Oh, it's a good match. England versus Croatia you know?""

Stare.

""Sit down. Croatia's up by one goal.""

Hah Mother! 
And then groan, because England's going to lose. Why do I have so little faith?? They won 4-2 anyway, with my dad bursting into controlled cheers everytime someone scored. ""Oh good opportunity!"" ""what a wasted  chance!"" What. the. hell. Not exactly right soccer lingo, but still. This is my dad. The anti-anything-tv related. The only man i've known not to be into soccer. He must be feeling out of things at the office, where most of his colleagues are Brits. It was fun, anyhow, until morning when I was a walking zombie, gulping down more coffee while my mother grumbled.""I told you this would happen if you watched soccer. now you won't be able to study and your whole day will be messed up. And trust your father to allow it."" Hee. My dad rocks."

"event","It's been ages since I last posted an entry simply because I've been to lazy to put the fingers to the keyboard and type anything worth reading. Two weeks into the vacation and I've gotta say, I've had a good time. I've watched the latest movies, met up with my friends, watched TV, read, and do all the things that a girl on holiday's supposed to do.(except maybe go on holiday, that is!)Studying. Let's not even go there shall we?

Anyway, this post was supposed to be all about how I dislike the Prisoner of Azkaban movie. But well, I'm rather disturbed by something that's happened in my estate.

..<lj-cut text=""My neighbour exploded.(I warn you that this is gory shit)...""> 


So yes, he exploded, literally. The man's been living in the top unit of the block opposite mine and while I don't know him personally, I've seen him around. So well, he'd been dead for almost a week in his house and nobody knew,(he lives by himself since he got separated from his wife)till the neighbours started complaining about this foul smell coming from his place. One of the neighbours called up his wife and she opened up the place, they found him dead. He must have probably overdosed on pills or liquor or something because in the time in which he was lying dead in his hall over the week, his body built up with gas and... burst. I was so sickened when I heard about it. So they found him in a very grotesque-pieces-kind-of-way. If it couldn't get worse, his 'fluids' spread out onto the balcony(the windows were open all the while) and flowed through the drainage pipe that carries water out onto the grassy area below, leaving a mass of blood in the grass. There were actually stains all the way down on the walls of the block but I think they've been cleaned up to avoid any upsets. I'm kind of freaked out by the whole thing. I mean, I saw the guy around often. And he well, didn't just die.. What happened seems so unreal and sick and it really grosses me out completely. I can't go by my window without looking out of it at the house, which now has a red, large, suspended talisman of some sort hanging out of the window.

Anyway, about Harry Potter, to lighten to mood, I loved Ron, Snape and Crookshanks. Besides little parts of it, Alfonso Cuaron did no justice to the book at all.
 Ron is such a cutie!! I love the scene where he has a nightmare about spiders asking him to tap dance. Oh, and i think I have a thing for cats who have squashed faces. Snape rocks!"

I'm rushing about trying to finish up project work and get my room in order at the same time. We're having a sports carnival in school for the next two days. I have to run a near 15 km, split up through the night.(Joel, you cheated me)It'll be fun, overnighting in school with the rest of school, but I'm tired and my voice was pretty spent today jeering at the tennis great Anthony Muki Tan for being such a loser and the Nat Schools finals. Daniel Harland has such a cute ass. I look forward to seeing him at next year's games. I have the whole morning to slack around with Gracie since we're not doing anything, Soft tennis stuff in the afternoon and then the SportsExel people have a tea reception with their mentors, so I'll be just going there to stuff my face since Andrew will not be around for me to meet yet. I really should go now cause its almost twelve and I have nothing packed and my room's in a mess and so is my head i think. This entire entry has been a complete waste of time. -__-"

"event","A quick update on my life, since I'm never going to have the time(or make the effort) to type something long and wordy for awhile..

Still hating the toilet-loving project work group. Proposal has been approved, yet nobody knows exactly what to focus on. Spoonie is the stupidest girl I've ever met. She wants to ask people whether they would DEFACATE in a public toilet, how they feel about flushing the toilet after PEEING and whether their mood improved after being in a clean toilet. Everytime I think she could not get stupider, she proves me wrong.

Andrew Kam, the great Singapore tennis star is going to be my mentor! Whee! I'm pretty excited about the whole scholarship programme. Looks set to be lots of fun. He's represented SIngapore in the Davis Cup! That's top notch stuff! College day is on Saturday. I'll get my cheque for the scholarship then. Money for Hadhafang!

Got caught a few times in school today. I was in the middle of skipping econs when Ms Ho messaged me to tell me that she was coming to the lecture theatre to collect the $10 that I owed her for the maTrix account. Had no choice but to tear myself from the library's direction and trudge back to the lt, only to space out to Ms-whatever-her-name-is's droning. Training was pretty boring. I was having fun being pushed around in the tennis ball cart by Zong Tang when we got caught by coach. Got a little ticking off later from him, but well.. ahha.. he looks a tad bit amused. After training Grace, Ming, Grinch and I walked out to the back gate to get out of the school but it was locked. Nobody was interested in going all the way back to the sports com to get a PE teacher with the key, so we decided to climb the gate, which would have gone along smoothly if Miss Leong did't decide to walk into school with her boyfriend. What they hell they come back to school every thursday night for is beyond me, I've seen them coming in several times. She looked pretty ticked off at first and asked for our pdps and teachers in charge and stuff, but I think she got amused with Grace, who was as usual, freaking out, stuck on the gate. She just might have saved us. My dad was there, the whole time, sitting in his car and watching us, highly amused. Hah!

So then, this is not as unwordy as I said it would be. I suddenly have lots more to type but I have a million things to do tonight, so i'll stop here."

I've been having a horrible day. So many things have happened and I really just want to leave school right now.

Nicholas is gone. He's been expelled and its for good. I don't know why but I'm very upset by the news, even though I've said before that I was certain it was going to happen sooner or later. Much as i love to hate him, he's a sweet guy in his own way. He always managed to make my smile or laugh. He actually turned up for my games to cheer for me and tell me how I was great. While he's an idiot I like the guy . He's been a great buddy in a way, that racist pig. He bought me a rabbit bouquet on Valentine's day. No matter how much of an idiot he is, he's such a sweetheart and I'm going to miss him in class. Why did he have to be such a damn slacker??

We got our draw for the second round today. As if we haven't been through enough in the past few days, we get this. I know its all a matter of luck who you meet in the draw, but did we really have to get this? Fate can be such a bitch. YOU. You FAT B******. I can't believe you actually threw your game to try and get us out. How could you be so unethical? Bet you didn't think we'd win big on Wednesday. Yet, you are given such a fantastic opportunity to win, when you bloody don't deserve it.

We got back our project work proposals. I was looking at it for the first time, since i was sick on the day it was done. Toilets. Thats out topic, a choice which i had no control over since it was approved by the majority. We are going to get a band 4. I believe so. They want cushioned toilet seats. They say toilets will relieve student's stress. They say its so cute and interesting. They say the title is: Loo users searching for comfort. I say NOOOOOOO. I see the MOE chucking our project into the dustbin. I see a band four in my A level slip. I see NUS saying no. (hey, this could be a new way out couldn't it?)

GRRRRRRRRR. To top things off, I see Peter Pan, and revesit the hopelessness of it all."

Spent the morning sitting under a tree cheering, along with the rest of the girls, for the guys, who were playing against SAJC. They won. We screamed for them, not that most of them showed much concern for us being there. There are many ways I could have spent my free saturday afternoon.

Had lunch with the girls and then we hung around in the canteen for a bit, playing cards, while I sang love songs to Grace. She was quite pleased, I could tell, though she did suggest I sing them to Peter Pan instead. Oh how I wish I could!

Went for dinner with some family friends. Took a nice walk along One Fullerton. It would be so perfect..I was really tempted to try getting into Centro. It's been so long since I last danced! 

Well, that pretty much wraps up my day. I hate the weather. It's friggin hot. I'm perspiring in an air-conditioned room.

Yesterday was sports day. It was crap. I played tennis throughout. He didn't even turn up. I was rather relieved since I don't want him to see me in the bloody house tee. Grinch won three golds and the individual championships! God that girl can run. 


Anyhoo, i can't think of anything else I want to say at this point in time, so I'm going to knock off.. Adios!"

I've had a very happy year, I must say. It feels good, cause last year was horribly rough. I just love the people around me. It's really amazing how I've found all these people amoung the sea of cheenas in TJ. The normal people. I'm particularly happy to have Grinch around. We have no idea how we get along with each other, since we're so extremely different, but we do! 

I've finally gotten a new coach. He seems pretty good. He's one of the head coaches of the SPEX training groups, so I'm willing myself to trust him. It'll take awhile. The training's been good so far. I nearly cried on court the other day when he was evaluating me the other day and he made a comment about how I would have been two levels higher than I was today, had I had proper competition training. Oh how I hate FB. Damn him for messing with me. I feel like all that effort I put in has all been a waste. But I will train hard, and get better. I will not give up till I'm happy with my standard.

[Speaking of tennis, the girls have concluded that of the year one guys, we have four gentlemen eand a ruffian. (tsk, Bharat! wahahaa)]

I am currently a walking zombie. I've been pathetically sleep deprived for the past week. My right eye has been red for more than a week and i keep gettin friends coming up to me and asking if I'm alright because I look like i've just cried.(poor teary eyed me!lol..) I'd better get some good sleep tonight. I think I'm rather annoying people with my whinging and whining. This morning, my dad was going along with his usual nagging and I, for no reason, really burst into tears(for no good reason or feeling!)and shocked to poor man. (""is it really a crime to remind you to read the tamil newspapers?"" ) Oh, the near cataclysmic effects of my lack of sleep time..

Can't really remember what the rest did, but I assure you, majority of them were stupid. Singing songs and acting the fool is not my idea of council campaigning. There were persons who did actually take the whole thing seriously, but most of them were too soft to really make much impact. People need to work on their delivery. Of course I'm not saying this with the idea that I would have made a great councillor, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have done such an idiotic job on stage. Meh. In the end, the biggest idiots will be elected. Murphy's Law.
This school is fucking cheena. And if you believe that cheena equals to chinese, you're an idiot too.

I just got back from Good Friday service. Year after year, I walk into church on Good Friday, grumble a little about the lengthy service, feel a little sad, and walk out, with nothing much changed. This time, it's been different. Much more emotional than usual. I would attribute it to me having watched The Passion of Christ last weekend. Call it a spiritual uplifting, I feel like I've finally seen the deeper meaning of my faith. It was so horrible, emotional and frightening. Yet it was so real. That is what happened and that is what He did for us. I have never cried so much while watching a movie. Having said that, it's not persuaded me to become a nun and devote my whole life to God, but it's definitely opened my eyes to the better person I could be. Anyway, enought about that, I shall just try my best to be a good person. 

Had lunch with Audrey and Bertina after mass. I kins of miss those two. It's funny how you have so much to catch up on with people living right next to you.

I took part in the Javelin event for our school's sports day. Came in fifth. Haha..Grinch's been doing really well with her heats. She's won the 100m hurdles and she's first for her 100m and 200m heats. Fantastic runner that girl is. Speaking of grinch, I was kind of pissed off with my tennis cap the other day. The guys were having training and grinch was taking part in her event(200m i think), and he saw her coming in first, and he exclaimed ""eh Indian!"" or something like that. I don't think he actually realised that I was standing right there until Adi told him that I was her close friend. It wasn't really blatant discrimination, but the prejudice was there. It just pisses me off when people think like that. In my opinion, there's no such thing as race. To me, we're just one big family. (i'm such a freaking idealist, aren't i?)"

I've been playing alot of unusual players of late, and I'm definitely learning alot more. I can definitely see myself analysing my strokes more during the game, so I'm fairly satisfied. I hope I'm peaking at the right time, the nationals are next week or some time around there.

We saw a circular rainbow around the sun during training. It was so beautiful. It was very poignant when we all gathered below it and made a wish together for our team. We've been training hard. We all want to get somewhere. There's always hope.."

"event","I'm on some sort of high, the non-alcoholic kind. lol.. Just played against Meridian JC. We beat them four to one. Quite happy with my performance today. I did not lose me temper. I did not throw my racket on the court. I won. But to be very honest and modest, my opponent was really bad, so it doesn't count. I was rather disappointed that I didn't get to play singles against DJ's ex, but well..
Hana-banana!<lj user=""kimmer12"">! It was wonderful to see you after so long, sweets! And Yan, Ra, Emilia and Khairah too.

I'm addicted to Toxic by Britney Spears. Blah. I can't stand that its by that stupid twit. But its such a sexy, bitch-kicking song!

It's been a long, tiring day. OHH! I just have to gloat a little on the fact that I actually had a conversation today with Peter Pan. (!!!!) Grinchy swears that it was flirting, but I think not! (not that I really mind anyway)I did say some pretty stupid stuff though. Anyway, Peter Pan's hot. His hairstyle hot! Gahhh..Way too much hotness. Grace was standing nearby grinning away. I'm lucky, boyy. wahaha.."

"event","So we're back to reality. Lectures, tutorial and work. God, when was the last time I actually did that? So it hits home that life can't all about fun and games. My dad's still trying to convince himself that he's convinced me to do a basic degree rather than specialise straight away. He's so cute. I love him loads and loads but, sorry buddy, I've got plans ahead in my life, and studying's not much included.

I need to focus. My game's been kind of screwy of late. Not playing up to my expectations. I'm wondering if I should get back to personal training. I've stopped that for almost a year but I think I could do better with one now. The thing is, where to find a good coach? FB's out of the question. Dad would never agree to hire him again, and I would't be keen on it either. He kind of screwed me up last year anyway. I have never really forgotten that nasty time.

No lessons for the next two sundays! I honestly need a break from some of those kids. Brats that they are! You get the sweet, adorable ones, but you can never escape the horrors. Kel and I've really got the horrors of the horrors in out class. (oh the horror! lol) Russell's going in to army tomorrow, Kelvin on thurs. Good luck you guys!"

I say boom! It's hot in here!
We need some Chiogi in the atmosphere!
Ole Ole Ole Ole
light, light light!
(x2)
CHIIIIIIOOOOOGIIII!!!

Why do I bother to turn up?
Chiogi, by the way, is a name of a mushroom. Our OGs are named after MUSHROOMS.
The story of our orientation is how (Super)Mario and Luigi were living happily in Toadstool Kingdom till Princess Peach was kidnapped. So now, we have an orientation.

I will not do mass dancing to S Club and the Backside Boys. I would very much like to whack the Orientation committee. (parapara. *growls*) 
Who are these people, and where the hell do they come from??"

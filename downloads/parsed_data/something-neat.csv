The place will hopefully be empty of everything except couches and a few other things.  Stop by!  Say hi!  Or just call me!  I am probably not going to have internet access at my parents for a while...  Not until I purchase a computer of my own.  I will go to Joes place and use his periodically to check up on things.

She wanted more than I could give at the time and hopefully this guy can give it.

Uhhhhh.  Yeah...  Basically what I am saying is I am bored whenever I am not at work or out taking pictures.  I suppose I should get another job?  Or get a girlfriend so that I have somewhere to go and waste my wasted time.  Another job sounds fun though.  I work about 52-56 hours a week between the two already...  Whats another 10 or so at another job?

A half hour past when I was supposed to leave!  Ugh!  I wanted to stab her.

I played with knives last night as always.  No one trusts me with them, I wouldn't do harm.  I need to be in a place where while I am drunk I can just break things.  I think I would like that.  

I still have about 40ish jello shots in the fridge, and no one will come over and finish them off with me.  :-(  I might have to throw them away, I just don't want them here tomorrow night.  The roomies return!

OHHHH!!!!  I forgot to tell you all!!!  Waffles died!  :-(  She was two and a half.  My most favoritist rattie.  She died Thursday morning sometime.  She was fine weds. night, but not in the morning after.  I have decided to wait till all of my other rats are dead, then I am taking a break for a while, then I am going to get one rat, and that is it.

I might go out with them tonight though.  Depends on how smelly I am after work.  I am doing laundry right now so I will look kind of clean for once. haha

Whenever I get the motivation, I am going to exercise like crazy and try to lose at least 50 pounds.  When that happens, who knows!  I have the perfect opportunity right now with the two jobs.  I just have this bad habit of getting Burger King after the pet shop.  I should invest in some of those protein shakes or something.

Heading to Angelina's house in a bit, gonna make us some din-din.  

I think I am doing pretty good with my diet...  I haven't weighed myself yet, but I feel lighter or something.  I have been eating less, haven't had fast food as much, and been eating much healthier in general.  My exercising kinda stopped last week, me bad.

My goal is 60 pounds lost by June...  I wanna lose these boobies too, thems getting big, too big.

besides that, nothing too grand happening.  Laters taters!

I got me a new '06 Civic!  It is sweetness!  I have had it for almost two weeks now and I have been driving around everywhere of course.  I have washed it twice and my mother and I put some seat covers on the front seats.  

I miss my Accord....  I still have it and need to get rid of it...  But I still miss it...  Though, the Civic is sweetness.

Other than that...  My birthday party was pretty fun, and I wish more of you were there to witness me being drunk and weird.  Maybe next time!

Next Friday, Jan. the 13th!  You all should come over to the apartment, and hang out with me and everyone else.  We will drink, catch up for the past year and promise to hang out with each other more than last year!  

If anyone on this here livejournal is interested, either call me, or come see me at Acme, or send me an E-mail, or leave a message on here!  I promise to be a better friend to all of you that want me to, and I am making that a resolution for the year.  

Other than this, I have nothing really new to say...  My car hates me right now, and I have to get a new one soon... I want a new '06 Civic.  Uhhh.  Still dating Angelina, its been a year now.  My phone was out of service for the past two weeks for anyone that happened to call and didn't get me.  Sorry.

I need to type in here more often.  I think I said I would last year, and didn't...  I will do my best to type more for myself, and for all of ya'll that like to read this junk.

"event","Wellll, kids!  I am sitting here at Justin's computer, upstairs from mine.  My computer died a while ago, and I haven't fixed it yet.  I am amazed at how long I have lived without the internet...  I think, after sitting here for about 20 mins, I need her back, hehe.  

In the land of me, which is luckily nothing like 'The Devil's Rejects', which was horrid, I have been doing one of four things basically...  Working, Sleeping, Eating, Video Games, of my girlfriend, Angelina.  Wait, that is five...  Oh well, so my math skeellzz have gone awry, but my gaining weight skeellzz have not.  In the past year I have gained 30 or so pounds.  Sucks, yeah.  So, I need to develop a serious addiction to losing weight, any ideas on how?  I would love for you to enclose them in a message on this here thingy, which I hope to get onto alot more.  I do say that every time, don't I?  Well...  Uhhh....  I will do what I can to not make me a liar.  

All you kids that I have not seen in quite some time, call me!  We MUST hang out!  You know who you are, and basically, if you have my number you are who should call!  I haven't been to lively outside of my relationship with Angelina, and I need to get back into hanging out with all of you all!  I do appologize for not hangning with all of you kids.  It makes me sad, I do think of most of you almost every day.  :-)

My first PSP died, and I purchased a Nintendo DS.  I have discovered that the DS is a much better purchase, and I recommend it to everyone.  If you do have one or get one, CALL ME!  We have an almost weekly DS night here, and it is mega fun!

My balls are on fire!

I haven't seen too many shows as of late, and I don't know of too many coming.  If you know of some, let me know!  I am always down for music!

Movies have sucked lately, and there are a few that are coming out that I am expecting to be horrible, but I will go see anyways...  'Doom', 'Aeon Flux', and 'Chicken Little'.  Though, Chicken Little looks funny!  

Sky High was corny and cheesy but I liked it...  Devils Rejects was HORRID, as I am sure you have already read.

I AM still at the Acme as some of you know.  I have no more overtime, and that sucks ass.  Uhhhh...

I think this concludes my update of me, and I appologize for not reading any of your posts in the past few months...  If there is anything that I have missed, that is important, or I should know about, let me know!  

Bye friends and internet peeps.  I hope to hear from you!!!  Leave me a message on here in the least saying you want to hang out!  

:0)

Uhh, life has been good for the most part.  I had vacation a couple weeks ago.  I went to Georgia with Angelina (the GF).  That was fun times.  Well, as much fun as you can have with a family that has 3 kids and not so much money.  We did our own thing as well.  It was nice.

I miss alot of you kids on here.  I need to visit you sometime.  Leave me a message here, since my e-mail isn't seemingly working, if you wanna hang out.   Anyone else having trouble with hotmail?

I feel icky or something right now.  That feeling of lonely or needing to be doing something productive...  Feeling useless or something... bah

I feel lost at the moment, and I know I will more than likely be fine in the morning.  I like to tell people that death is the easiest way of life...  I like being cryptic and sound depressing, I find amusement in it.  I do not know why, but being like that makes me smile.  

I am sickly at the moment.  I had to unload two trucks on Thursday night at work out in the cold for 2 and a half hours...  No fun.  Now I have icky throatness and runny nose stuff.

My car ended up only costing me 55 dollars!  I guess one of the 'transaxles' popped out of the 'transmission' and that is why I was leaking.  All he had to do was stick it back in and realign something, or something.  All I know is, my mechanic is awesome and is a very honest man seemingly.  My dad took his car to Speedy, cus he needed his break lines replaced, and Ron at 'Zeke's' (my mechanic) was on vacation.  Speedy fed him this crap about how the rear breaks are going to go bad when they put the break lines on cus of some surge of break fluid rushing back there and destroying them.  They said $600 to do the job.  My dad waited...  Went to Zeke's...  Guess what!?  $170!!!!!!!  1/3 of the cost!  When I got my heater fixed there...  He fixed my glove box!!  AND didn't charge me!  He rawks!  I am going to buy him a gift next Chistmas.  =D

Other than car drama, I have been up to the normal agenda of work and nothingness...  I saw 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' last night, and it was pretty good.  I did laugh hysterically a few times, but overall, I think the movie kind-of lacked, but I did greatly enjoy some of the many quirks within it!

What great thing has ever been accomplished by someone who truly believed that he could not do it? How much time do you devote to anger? How much energy do you spend on resentment? How much of your effort goes toward envy or revenge? What value will these things ever provide? <br /><br />Everything has a cost. If you let someone make you angry, you've given a precious part of yourself away to them. Is it worth it? What will it get you? If you let something get you down, it just steals away that much of your life. <br /><br />You can't really control what other people do, or what they say. Yet you have complete control over the way you respond to the people and events around you. Seeing everything as negative, will accomplish nothing. Make the effort to stay positively focused, regardless of the situation. Look for the good and you will find it. Transcend the need for wasteful negativity, and you'll have more than enough energy for abundant success and fulfillment. </font>"

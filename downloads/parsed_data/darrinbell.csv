"event","Okay, after getting my second strip <a href=""http://www.candorville.com"" target=""_top"">Candorville</a> on its feet, I've decided to make the time to update my blog more regularly.

However, I wanted to integrate the blog into my site and have the blog files stored on my own server, just to be sure I'll always have access to them (never know when Livejournal or another source may go under). Since I don't have the time to figure out Moveabletype, I'm using the new Blogger system. Since Google bought Blogger, they've turned it into a free service. I can have it publish to a directory on my own server, upload files, etc., and I've integrated it into my sites using iframes. I wish there were a way to embed the blog directly into pages (and if there is, I hope someone will tell me), but iframes are the next best thing.

You can see the new blog at http://www.bellcartoons.com (just click on ""Darrin's Blog""), or go to http://www.rudypark.com/bcn/frames_blog.asp"

"event","I gave an interview last week for the Daily Californian, and at the end, the reporter asked me if I had anything else interesting to say about myself -- Any hobbies or interests outside of cartooning.

I mentioned that I like to take long walks/hikes in the middle of the day (sometimes along the marina, other times through Downtown Oakland, or at Inspiration Point), I read some (okay, mostly comic books, but that still counts, right?). I like sitting at busstops and park benches just to watch people (not usually in a stalker sort of way, although I often feel like Jane Goodall, without the camera and funny hat). I'm into science fiction, I play tennis, I like watching stand-up comics, seeing live music and movies, going to museums, spending time with my fianc&#233;, hanging out from time to time with friends, and...

...well, okay, that actually does sound like enough (God knows I don't even have time for all that, usually). I guess I don't need more interests right now.

But the point is, none of that is all that interesting to say in an interview. Sometimes the things we enjoy are very vanilla when they're spelled out like that. I should've said I operate a pro bono legal-aid service for rodeo clowns in my spare time, but I think she probably would've seen through that."

<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/international/worldspecial/13BAGH.html"">Pillagers Strip Iraqi Museum of Its Treasure</a>
By JOHN F. BURNS

BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 12 &#8212; The National Museum of Iraq recorded a history of civilizations that began to flourish in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia more than 7,000 years ago. But once American troops entered Baghdad in sufficient force to topple Saddam Hussein's government this week, it took only 48 hours for the museum to be destroyed, with at least 170,000 artifacts carried away by looters.

The full extent of the disaster that befell the museum only came to light today, as the frenzied looting that swept much of the capital over the previous three days began to ebb. 

 As fires in a dozen government ministries and agencies began to burn out, and as looters tired of pillaging in the 90-degree heat of the Iraqi spring, museum officials reached the hotels where foreign journalists were staying along the eastern bank of the Tigris River. They brought word of what is likely to be reckoned as one of the greatest cultural disasters in recent Middle Eastern history.

 A full accounting of what has been lost may take weeks or months. The museum had been closed during much of the 1990's, and like many Iraqi institutions, its operations were cloaked in secrecy under Mr. Hussein. 

 So what officials told journalists today may have to be adjusted as a fuller picture comes to light. It remains unclear whether some of the museum's priceless gold, silver and copper antiquities, some of its ancient stone and ceramics, and perhaps some of its fabled bronzes and gold-overlaid ivory, had been locked away for safekeeping elsewhere before the looting, or seized for private display in one of Mr. Hussein's myriad palaces.

 What was beyond contest today was that the 28 galleries of the museum and vaults with huge steel doors guarding storage chambers that descend floor after floor into unlighted darkness had been completely ransacked. 

 Officials with crumpled spirits fought back tears and anger at American troops, as they ran down an inventory of the most storied items that they said had been carried away by the thousands of looters who poured into the museum after daybreak on Thursday and remained until dusk on Friday, with only one intervention by American troops, lasting about half an hour, at lunchtime on Thursday.

 Nothing remained, museum officials said, at least nothing of real value, from a museum that had been regarded by archaeologists and other specialists as perhaps the richest of all such institutions in the Middle East. 

 As examples of what was gone, the officials cited a solid gold harp from the Sumerian era, which began about 3360 B.C. and started to crumble about 2000 B.C. Another item on their list of looted antiquities was a sculptured head of a woman from Uruk, one of the great Sumerian cities, dating from about the same era, and a collection of gold necklaces, bracelets and earrings, also from the Sumerian dynasties and also at least 4,000 years old.

 But an item-by-item inventory of the most valued pieces carried away by the looters hardly seemed to capture the magnitude of what had occurred. More powerful, in its way, was the action of one museum official in hurrying away through the piles of smashed ceramics and torn books and burned-out torches of rags soaked in gasoline that littered the museum's corridors to find the glossy catalog of an exhibition of ""Silk Road Civilizations"" that was held in Japan's ancient capital of Nara in 1988.

 Turning to 50 pages of items lent by the Iraqi museum for the exhibition, he said that none of the antiquities pictured remained after the looting. They included ancient stone carvings of bulls and kings and princesses; copper shoes and cuneiform tablets; tapestry fragments and ivory figurines of goddesses and women and Nubian porters; friezes of soldiers and ancient seals and tablets on geometry; and ceramic jars and urns and bowls, all dating back at least 2,000 years, some more than 5,000 years.

 ""All gone, all gone,"" he said. ""All gone in two days.""

An Iraqi archaeologist who has participated in the excavation of some of the country's 10,000 sites, Raid Abdul Ridhar Muhammad, said he had gone into the street in the Karkh district, a short distance from the eastern bank of the Tigris, about 1 p.m. on Thursday to find American troops to quell the looting. By that time, he and other museum officials said, the several acres of museum grounds were overrun by thousands of men, women and children, many of them armed with rifles, pistols, axes, knives and clubs, as well as pieces of metal torn from the suspensions of wrecked cars. The crowd was storming out of the complex carrying antiquities on hand carts, bicycles and wheelbarrows and in boxes. Looters stuffed their pockets with smaller items.

Mr. Muhammad said he found an American Abrams tank in Museum Square, about 300 yards away, and that five marines had followed him back into the museum and opened fire above the looters' heads. This drove several thousand of the marauders out of the museum complex in minutes, he said, but when the tank crewmen left about 30 minutes later, the looters returned.

 ""I asked them to bring their tank inside the museum grounds,"" he said. ""But they refused and left. About half an hour later, the looters were back, and they threatened to kill me, or to tell the Americans that I am a spy for Saddam Hussein's intelligence, so that the Americans would kill me. So I was frightened, and I went home.""

 Mr. Muhammad spoke with deep bitterness toward the Americans, as have many Iraqis who have watched looting that began with attacks on government agencies and the palaces and villas of Mr. Hussein, his family and his inner circle broaden into a tidal wave of looting that targeted just about every government institution, even ministries dealing with issues like higher education, trade and agriculture, and hospitals.

 American troops have intervened only sporadically, as they did on Friday to halt a crowd of men and boys who were raiding an armory at the edge of the Republican Palace presidential compound and taking brand-new Kalashnikov rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.

 American commanders have said they lack the troops to curb the looting while their focus remains on the battles across Baghdad that are necessary to mop up pockets of resistance from paramilitary troops loyal to Mr. Hussein. 

 Mr. Muhammad, the archaeologist, directed much of his anger at President Bush. ""A country's identity, its value and civilization resides in its history,"" he said. ""If a country's civilization is looted, as ours has been here, its history ends. Please tell this to President Bush. Please remind him that he promised to liberate the Iraqi people, but that this is not a liberation, this is a humiliation."""

"event","A cartoonist died today. Jerry Bittle, creator of Geech and Shirley & Son, passed away from a heart attack while vacationing in Honduras.

I didn't know Jerry, but I knew his work. In fact, when my first strip was syndicated, one of the sales kits they sent us (they send sales kits to newly-syndicated cartoonists to give them an idea of how they might want to create their own sales kit) was ""Shirley & Son."" It was a gentle strip that had an edge to it, because it was an honest (well, occasionally idealized) look at an innocent kid dealing with the issues surrounding his parents' divorce. As someone whose parents divorced when I was young, I was glad to know there was someone out there creating stories from that sort of experience. I know that, had Jerry been creating that strip when I was 10, I'd have found it comforting. I know he must have helped more children with that strip than he could have imagined.

I was looking forward to telling him so next month at the Reubens in San Francisco, but now I won't get that chance. I hope his family will be all right. Wherever he is now, I'm sure he knows what good he's done.

Our Middle East correspondent, Judy Woodcuff, is in Baghdad now, with the latest. Judy, how much dust would you say is rising from the ground where the statue fell?""

<b>Judy:</b>""I don't know, Tom, but the dust started rising about 20 seconds after the statue came to rest. It appears to be sand, Tom, although the dust has yet to be analyzed. Nobody seems worried about it. People are cheering, although it's unclear whether they're cheering because of the dust, or because of the wind that has just started up and is whipping the dust into interesting swirls, and...""

<b>Tom:</b> ""Hold on, Judy, we've got breaking news! The statue, according to reliable sources on the ground, appears to have fallen at 10:06 am, not 10:05, as previously reported. The Defense Department has not yet issued a statement confirming this, but it would be interesting to know exactly what happened here, whether the statue began falling at 10:05 and didn't completely hit the ground until 10:06, or whether the statue did not actually begin falling until 10:06. Judy?""

<b>Judy:</b> ""As I was saying, Tom, the statue...""

<b>Tom:</b> ""Judy, we're going to cut away right now, we have retired General McCaffrey here, who's going to show us on our incredible 3-D map of the statue, just where the stress points were that contributed to the statue's demise...""

<b>General McCaffrey (with pointer):</b> ""As you can see here, there was already considerable stress  at the base of the statue, where there were several significant indentations. Probably the result of pecking by some sort of bird. From the angle of deflection, it appears likely it was the work of the Manx Shearwatter, a puffin that's fond of statues. It could also have been caused by the Merlin, the Mottled Petrel, or the Mississippi Kite.""

<b>Tom:</b>""General, looking at the cracks emanating from the indentation in the middle, I'd have to wonder if perhaps it wasn't some sort of pigeon.""

<b>General McCaffrey:</b>""I think it would sooner be a Canvasback than a Pigeon, but we are in proximity to China, so that is indeed a possibility. In any case, the Marines obviously knew just where to pull on the statue, when they saw these stress marks. There aren't too many situations they're not prepared to tackle. They're extremely well trained, and they made short work of the enemy statue.""

<b>Tom:</b> ""Thank you General. Back to Judy. Judy, is there any word yet on exactly how high the dust drifted overhead once the statue struck the ground?""

<b>Judy:</b> ""Well, Tom, what I was saying earlier, was that...""

<b>Tom:</b>""Sorry Judy, we've got to take a break. Coming up, British forces tangle with a statue in Basra."""

I never thought it was a good idea to fill out some online application, telling total strangers about yourself as if you're filling out a job application (most jobs don't come with the prospect of sex, but that's neither here nor there). 

It's got to be a humiliating experience, because in order to divulge anything of interest about yourself, you've got to examine yourself. You've got to look at every unfortunate, nasty, crusty aspect of your life, and make sure you <i>do not</i> mention them. Even if your real hobby is clipping your toenails and marvelling at how many walls in your apartment they bounce off before disappearing (I hold the record in my household, with 3), you've got to say you spend your free time reading Camus. If you're a shallow person, and all you care about are humongous breasts, there's apparently an uncontrollable urge to preface that by saying ""I want someone who's beautiful on the inside, not just on the outside."" If you lie, your relationship is doomed, because you can't start a relationship based on a lie. If you tell the truth, odds are you'll end up with somebody who assumed you were lying, and read ""between the lines"" that you like being lied to in return.

All that aside, there&#8217;s an even more fundamental flaw: computers don&#8217;t know people. They know 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s, but they don&#8217;t know chemistry (unless it&#8217;s a computer in a chem lab). I could be wrong, but that&#8217;s what I believe. 

And my belief was proven right yet again, when I tried clicking on the LiveJournal link that's supposed to find the individual most compatible with me. Mind you, I graduated from Berkeley, think the Second Amendment applies only to militias, not individuals, don&#8217;t believe in the war in Iraq, and am still waiting for that last chad to be found in Florida. LiveJournal found, as my ideal pen-pal, Bob, a card-carrying member of the NRA and Bush supporter, whose hobbies are &#8220;hunting, hunting, and hunting.&#8221;

Bob was not amused. Even though I began my e-mail with &#8220;Walrus.&#8221;"

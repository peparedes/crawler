"event","See told you I'd update today. Hehe.
lets see um, My sites pretty much done. ^_^ I'm so happy, it's so perdy. And you guys get to see it!
The newsgroup that i told you about on wensday is currently boring me to tears ;_;. not fun.
http://www.fg-a.com/buttons.htm free button site, u like? http://www.tomaweb.com/buttons.asp and more free buttons @_@ I'm feeling silly.

Now lets see shareware from dun dun dun... http://www.shareware.com/ 
Alot of servers are down right now, but no one has really commented on it. anyone else find it odd? The servers that where down last night where drunkduck, Keenspace, pair and kissthis. They may not be the biggest servers but they are the ones that websites I go to are on. *_* it made me cranky.

Heres another virius program for you, cookiecanning, it goes through the server, (you have to have it's 'intermate details' to do this)and it eats whatever shouldn't be there, it's basicly an anti-cookiemonster virus.
Ta-da and done. w00t"

"event","Yeah. This is an update covering about two weeks and I'll do another of friday.
Project is going gooood ish.
Here's a link to a writing newsgroup, it is not a writers newsgroup. Subtle but important difference.
atl.writing  http://groups.google.com.au/group/alt.writing/browse_thread/thread/2b05f66b111b08d5/ad0b94b7298da2ce?lnk=st&q=Writers+newsgroups&rnum=1&hl=en#ad0b94b7298da2ce

http://www.codeproject.com/ a place to get free base coding for websites, so you don't have to worry if you don't know the particulars of C++ tis groovy.
I found this interesting shareware called DarkLoad or something like that, use it if your internet is really slow but if it's not then don't as it will keep crashing.
I've done more inverstergating in the last few weeks of internet services in my area, we where supposted to have broadband capability by xmas. Now it's xmas next year. *sigh* ;_; very sad.
I found this viris ware called Cookiemonster, it's pretty cool. It goes into a server and backs up chosen files on them and thats it, you don't lose your stuff. But don't use it as it's illeagel. ~_~
and thats it, catch u friday."

My website is going good, but I need to get my bro to help me find some of his pics that he's hidden somewhere.
www.somethingpositive.net is a website that is liked by many but is not user-freindly so I'm going to try to not copy him.
My Email had just been infected with a viris, that I have had to get rid of by getting my virisware altered (not quite legal-don't ask).

I've done work on my website, it is looking more and more interesting everyday. 
I've found liks and made pics. Working out the different browser sizes is so hard though.
I forgot to update this over the holidays, but it's not like I did much then anyway. My USB drive did something weird so I couldn't use it, but all better now.

Um Writing websites? I was going to say www.writingforrookies.net but they have just moved or closed or something. They even had some shareware for downloading.
hi5 is a freind chat thing, I don't like it much.
My hotmail is slightly busted, it keeps deleteing everything but what I want deleted. if this happens to you use a virisware thingy (In my case it's a programing error that hasn't been fixed yet)
Anywho that all I wanna say for today. And anything else about my website? Sore wa himitsu desu.
Later.

hehe

a) My project seems to be crawling with a wound in its stomach and is crying out 'Medic!' it is also incredibly muddy and blending into the foreground and is hard to see. I think the medic is unable to see it.
Poor website

b) And heres that stuff  http://www.writing-for-profit.com/writing-for-profit-2.html (Don't ask) http://www.writingholidays.com/ (Both of these are about how to make money from writing)

c) I got my brothers friends email so now i'm going to ask him if he wan't a bit of the website. I go to many websites so I am constantly looking for designs that I like or that look cool.

d) http://www.freewarehome.com/Business_and_Productivity/Word_Processing/Professional_Writer_Tools_t.html a freeware program that help with short stories, it keeps track of how they're doing.

e) http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/bc-list.cfm?loc=1 list of broadband providers in Victoria.

f) http://www.mail.com/scripts/common/index.main?signin=1&lang=us mail.com, you would be advised not to use this one as gmail, hotmail and yahoo.com are all much better and less confusing.

g) will do mon capitan (french accent)

Claire has just been accused of infecting the class with something, but I wasn't listening. (Could have been ebola or something I wouldn't know) don't think it was anyway. Who cares, I'm going to think up stuff bout my website."

I have finally decided what my website will be about (me= ^_^)
My brother makes comics, funny ones. But he hasn't gotten a website for them yet.
He calls the comics a work of Kanad inc, I told him that he should have some sub companies.
Cerberus productions has joined with a little work by stush freelancing co.
That means that me and my bros freind can all put stuff on the site.
I'm going to make the site, It's going to be the collective works of both of us, with some cool stuff from stush.

"event","Remember everyone PEBKAC That term has helped many in tech support over the years.
(Real questions)
Why does it delete my work when I turn the computer off? You need to save it?
Why isn't the music thingy making music?
How come Sims isn't working? What do you mean we don't have Sims?
I think I deleted the internet.
I defiantly deleted the internet.
I deleted the computer.
The computers making whining noises and is starting to smoke, is that bad?

To all this I say PEBKAC. It doesn't solve anything, but it lets others who do the same thing know what the trouble was. (Sorry, my sister claimed to have broken 'everything, it stopped working', she had accidentlly turned the screen off)
1)My project is still going no where, I havn't decided what I'm doing.
2)www.thinkgeek is a cool site
3)Um i havn't done that since last week
4)Flashget is a cool download managing system, use it!
5)I have done some research, I now know that I might not get broadband in my area for three year, glee
6)um, nothing new to say."

Here is some stuff that I have to write for the assignment.

a) My project is not really going anywhere, I was trying to decide between a review site for TV shows and one about teddy bears. Now I don't want to do either. Maybe I should just do one advertising my work?
b) I hope no one has done this one yet, http://www.textengineer.com/ it's a website that shows how to get coaching and stuff for you writing. You have to pay and I think it's in America.
c) I saw some interesting website layouts, www.aliendice.com (It's a comic website but the layout is reasonably easy to navigate) 
d) We got this program called add-aware, it gets rid of cookies that get attched to you. You also get to choose if they should be deleted.
e) Iprimis, my ISP. They have given us a deal, we use them for our internet line and our phone line and the internet is cheap. Phone line is crap. They constantly drop out (as in both phone lines), so its not exaclly reliable. In fact it isn't good at all, we want broadband but it isn't in our area yet.
f) Does that mean just pay attention to them? Or do we have to write about them too? I don't like the VET viris manager (it dislikes me too).
g) Do that in a minuet
h) umm, how about no?

Look it I have now answered all the questions a bit. Cool right?

I am working on the tutorials.
I have noticed that I don't like tutorials.
I have also noticed that I would get more out of this program if I just messed about with it. (Get more out of the book by using it to make my sisters be nice to each other.)

I have a massive earache (ear infection) and I am tired. (My brother should tape his own shows.)

I have looked for some interesting backgrounds but have decided to create my own using Photoshop. I will use most of my own creations, except where I don't know how to do something or just don't want to.

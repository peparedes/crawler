love. why does it highlight everything? why does it style everything into a happy, buttercup kind of mindscape, too lovely to even breathe within.

"event","timelessness spurns me on. to want more. knowledge, wholeness and completion, liberation from this litter of diseases and desires. bemuses as it inspires, insults as it gives hope. hope to that temporal thing which quivers at the blackened, threaded mass that sits ahead like a fresh sponge soaked with lives and spoils. always ahead. always evokes a maddening trying to grasp it, trying to understand why, trying to reject and deny, trying to hide from, trying to make sane the insanity of it all. tis strange how the days seep into futility and yet, beyond the blackness is a light kind of madness. perhaps that is what destiny is. beyond the fusion of energies there is a pale light that lingers, like a vinegar waiting to betray a germ.

the only cloud tho, seem bound to the tides, always. but one day, that some beautiful 'one' day, being shall fall into these swollen tides and be unutterly complete, without thought or nonsensical sad. shall be full then. 

but as it is, yes, today has been a very good day, filled with the blessed content of 'moving on' and shifting into that new plain where freshness and tomorrow truly means that, and nothing but.

dearest journal, take care until our next conversant 'tryst' of yearning and otherness. 

begetting, 
a myriad of rosebuds,
tinkering about a slight of breeze xX"

<li><b> art</b>:<br>art is about expression and portrayel of beauty, natural or formed, dreamt or perceived. my father was a wondrous talent with a canvas and some oils, my love for art is a part of my adoration of him and the beauty he beheld and begot. </li><li><b> astrology</b>:<br>i'm crazily obsessed, rather infuriatingly for alot of people around me, with astrology and starsigns. i usually try to find out who is what and forge relations with them thereof. call it a type of defensive astro-fascism or a deep recognition of our relation to the stars as natural being forged from the creative animation of Nature itself. actually, its probably double trouble.</li><li><b> bowie</b>:<br>a wonderful musician and part of the glam-rock imagery and raw musical romantism that i love! low and station to station are my faves and i've recently got my hands on the very rare three-cd live set of him 'at the beeb', haunting and gratifyingly great!</li><li><b> carry on films</b>:<br>kenneth williams was another of my obsessions as a child. afetr reading his diaries i tried to consume the very essence of him through his comic genius and personal desolation. my respect for him remains and i adore the fabulous sauce and satire of the very naughty carry on genre!</li><li><b> dreams</b>:<br>if if weren't for dreams, i'd be lost within this very real place, without that song of truth within, and without the burgeoning kaliedoscope of rainbow tracing the surrounding of this mind.</li><li><b> film noir</b>:<br>naked tango - possibly the most influential film of my life. a beautifully set b-movie set in a Spanish Brothel in the twenties portraying the life of alba, a raven-haired heroine, who gets introduced to prostitution, love, naked tango and tragedy. beautiful.</li><li><b> love</b>:<br>an incurable romantic, i treasure all things romantique! from chocolate box moments, rich blood-red roses, dancing on the patio or cuddling up on the sofa with a good film, i'm there like the most pathetic of puppy-dog smittens, lapping up the cuteness and the heart-spun charm. </li><li><b> mansun</b>:<br>nothing beats the lover draped, and thus, my teen love affair with mr paul draper (lead-singer) spawned a saga of tears and obsession, a phone call to the fan-line to propose marriage, an ex-boyfriend who bore resemblage to the original stripper vicar, and even a backstage canoodle! oh, and lastly but most importantly, perhaps led to the forging of one of the most precious friendships of my life. </li><li><b> marmite</b>:<br>that brown gooey heavenous gunk, who can resist its charms! me and me ole mate mave used to commit mutual sniffage of this lush and brain-happy stuff on random debauched nights about town on the baileys and alco-pop razzle! bless it and the Lord Marmite, Creator, and establisher of Marmiteonism, the cult of B-vit truth.</li><li><b> mills and boon</b>:<br>i can honestly admit that my life would not be what it is now without the romantic lull of M & B. began reading them when i was but twelve years old and they saved my life. literally. and not many people say that i'm sure!</li>

"event","beloved journal, how strange to have formed such emotional resonance with you after such a brief acquaintance. softly you husk this form thru, into a dozen bluebells, sifting about my skins like a delicacy of silks and softs. how words can surrender my being to the winds. how is it thus? how can nothing fulfil, nothing be yearned, nothing be desired, but this, your spaces, your capacity for dreaming?

oh sweet and floated being, too tapered to cloak the stars, but free enough to liberate this, how this is all i esteem to be, how this is all the love that i shall ever know or ever desire to know, this, my worded friend, my sacred soul-spun songbird of rainbows and hearts.

something stilts tonight, something silent but more. a song is being sung, and is directly bled into the mists which surround. so, have decided bring completion upon the night, to savour the sweetest sort of lull, by partaking of the decadent and sacred leaf - tea. tea, sweet poison of the soul, english vice of fashion and poise. sweet tea saturated with a tender edge of soya cream. 

thus, with tea and apathy i bid you peace xX"

"event","with relief and the slight of joy i write this ever-necessary statement of today's piece. ah, lovely to be engaged with words once more. sometimes they are too flighty and empty, the language of day fills this with such abhorrence. how can the eyes within the face be so full, and yet the face so empty. desire to float into heaven again. it seems somehow familiar and yet somehow so cold. hope its warm and lofty. hope it begets that love with all those arms and steeples as once promised.

discovered something extraordinary that delights today. fudge, of the rum and raisin kind. the sweetest bliss, and i dare say, almost better than a sated afternoon in bed with one's lover. okay, not quite but almost. ah the tender melody of its scent and its chocolate encumbrance. my joy, sweet fudge.

softly i page away the day, and quilt this wanting with a slice of dreaming. how steadily this mind dreams. of that someday, when all one's life is concentrated, on the begetting and consuming, of rum and raisin fudge.

adieu et encumbrance xX"

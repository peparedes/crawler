"event","well...it's over. after 3 years of sweet sweet loving, Rupert the fish has moved to a new home in the Toronto Sewer System. this has strangely happened, maddy, about 4 days after the death of your fishy friend. it was so sad. he was at the bottom of his tank, all white coloured and hardened. i cried alot. i'm a suck like that. but that didn't stop me from going to the pet store an hour later. is that bad? i'm not ""replacing"" him. rupert was the best fish ever. he was pretty and swimmy and strong and i lost 5 points for having him in rez. he was my fishy lover. but we went to fairview (me dad and parnian aka the dognapper) anddddd we were looking at the fishes, and i picked this pretty swimmy red one..but then i was thinking...you will not be able to see him in the tank that i have because they are the same colour. so i picked a green tank with neon rocks. then my daddy said ""why dont you get another fish to put in the old tank?"" and i gladly accepted this suggestion. so along with the red beta that i got, also got a crown beta (crazy feathered fishy)to put in rupert's old tank. so. after much debating of names (jacques, frankenstein) and then more names to do with psych and history (freud, adler, satir, goebbles, himmler), i settled on Hans and Sophie, even though they are both boy fishes. hans and sophie scholl were a brother and sister duo during WWII who got together with some other people and formed a youth resistance group called The White Rose, and together they created and handed out anti-nazi leaflets. after the 5th one, they got caught and subsequently arrested and killed under hitler's rule. i wrote an esay this year that had a lot to do with them, and also saw the Sophie Scholl movie at bayview village in april (which was amazing even though it was german, maddy lets watch it again). so..there you have it, the history nerd in me has come out. and rupert is no more. only in my heart."

""ALL GOOD THINGS (COME TO AN END)"" LYRICS BY NELLY FURTADO AND CHRIS MARTIN
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

Honestly what will become of me
I don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is daily
We are what we don't see
We missed everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end

Travelling I always stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets it and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day until the feeling
went away
And the clouds were dropping and the...
The rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were whistling a new tune barking at the new moon"

"event","okay. so i've just come to terms with the fact that for the past 3 months i have not been healthy. way too much nausea and stomache crampage and headaches...and it has just occurred to me, maybe i am a gluten free just like my dad...which really is called Celiac Disorder. so i've stuck myself on this gluten free diet for a few days...which my dad says will make me feel better really fast if it actually is the gluten that is causing the problem. what is gluten you ask? EVERYTHING GOD DAMMIT. bread cereal soup pasta pizza. everything that has wheat or flour and a million other things. so i've been loading in the yogourt...and i ate lots of grapes, and hell i even bought a seven dollar loaf of gluten free bread. yes, it is that expensive. so soon enough, i should know if i need to cut out all of the good food in life....CHOCOLATE CAKE, CHINESE FOOD, CHICKEN FINGERS. oh help!

also. i've invested in a pair of those crazy leggings that everyone is wearing. now i need a skirt to go with it. and more leggings, and more skirts. wooooot. oh its a fun trend. look at me go, i'm the metric chick.

AND. people are STUPID. stupid STUPID people.

"event","well...i fell into the fad...and sadly, i have purchased an ipod. now...i'm not quite sure how this happened. i was just looking on craigslist.com...and there you can get used stuff for super cheap. so i got a black 2GB ipod slightly used for 150. i saved 100 dollars....not that i should have been spending my money on this in the first place. i'm actually pretty dissapointed in myself. for some reason i've always hated apple. i think its because of grade 3. remember how the teachers used to make all the kids spend time on the computers during class? and you'd get stickers everytime you did it? well i dreaded those days...i was technologically impaired and i cried when it was my turn. now in grade 3 we had 2 MACS and 2 APPLES. the apple computers were the math computers where all you could do was play stupid math games in the lonely stinky hallway of the school. i think i was traumatized by my inability to turn on the computer and...even once that was done, to get any questions right on the freaking games. yeah im pretty sure thats where my hate comes from. so when ipods came out, i made fun of everyone who spent their money on them...500 songs..who would need 500 songs on their freaking thing. im sorry to say that i only made it half way though my music library before my ipods memory was full and i had to purge some of my sweet sweet britney spears and abba music. so im sitting here...listening to it..and its good...and i like the clicking noise that it makes when i touch the wheel...and i just bought 3 ipod skins off ebay for a grand total of 8.47 which i must say is pretty good. shipping can be retardedly expensive. but anyways...i still am a little pissed that i had to be so freaking uncreative. i mean, its pretty...and its works...but i don't like apple. damn you, you stupid round fruit."

has anyone read the four agreements? because i have...and im trying desperately to remember one of them...i think number 2 or 3. and i cant find the info online. it wants me to buy the book and i dont want to. plus i think my mom and taryn both own it. i'll have to do some hunting. i just want to reread it. just the one part, other than that, its much too spiritual for me. it just makes a good point, is all.

hmm what else. maddy we need to go to body worlds. its closing soon. but whyyy does it cost 25 dollars! thats a lot of money that i dont really have right now! BOOOO. but also, i bought emperor's new groove on dvd so we can watch it soon. it is at our disposal. and we need to rent madagascar. and then yes. lots of plans for us. maddy what are these crazy tags im supposed to use on this thing? i dont understand a ""tag"". stupid tags. tags belong on clothing!

umm i accepted the offer of admission to york for history. so i'm gonna be just a history major for a while, until i find out what the psych department has to say after they see my final marks. im scared. my psych marks SUCK ASS. oh baby, oh baby baby. how was i supposed to know, that something wasn't right? oh baby baby. i shouldnt have let you goo0OO0oo0o0oOoooo.:) you love it maddy, just admit it. okay!! sleepy time tea now. nite!

also. today i was walking in the grass with my socks on...and i stepped in bird poopy. it was also white with brown chunks. so there you go. and don't tell me i'll be lucky. thats not what it means."

"event","ahoy there matees. i have entered the job market. what exactly am i doing? im not sure yet. i'll find out tomorrow. im guessing childrens or ladies wear at sporting life. possibly juniors. pay? no clue. hours? dunno. days? meh. the thing that pisses me off is that i have to schedule my social life around my job...which really isnt so bad. its just that this week i have 3 things planned and next week we're supposed to go to wonderland on friday...so i'll have to pick my days off carefully. im thinking friday and saturday. who knows. stupid thursday injections and periodic bloodwork. okay. this is what i need to do. work mornings on monday and tuesday, work evenings on wednesday and thursday. well not evenings, but afternoon. like 12-10 or whatever. and then...sunday whenever its open. that will work. get it got it good. 
i bought new clothes that are work appropriate. 2 skirts, one pair of capris, one striped sweater, 2 3/4 length sweaters, one pair of shoes. woo hoo."

Perhaps one of the most balanced of<br>all the colors.  By balanced, I mean balanced<br>in both bad and good parts.  Let me elaborate:<br>You're a natural, and somewhat superficial<br>person.  You're extremely generous, but, to add<br>to the confusion, you're frugal and stingy.<br>You're a forgiving, but jealous person.  You're<br>imaginative, but still logical.  At sometimes,<br>you're a complete neat-freak, and other times,<br>you're a total slob.  You're very stable, but<br>undependable.  But onto the other traits that<br>are associated with this color...  You're a<br>stubborn person, simply put.  Do you believe in<br>Feng Shui?  Green is closely related to the<br>thought of having a balanced environment, you<br>know.  When in a bad situation, you're<br>painfully pessimistic, and when you're in a<br>good situation, you're extremely optimistic.  A<br>fairly outgoing and amused person, you enjoy<br>talking to people, and hearing their thoughts<br>on different things.  As a plus, when people<br>hang around you, it seems like time passes by<br>all the more quickly.

"event","This just in. This is Kaitlin Strachan coming to you live from Empress Ave. I have just received a very special report from the Department of Smelly People. They have notified me that Maddy Beaupre is carrying a strong odor of poopy around with her everywhere she goes. Citizens of Toronto should be warned that if they smell anything that remotely resembles poopy of any kind, they should run like hell, as Maddy's poopy smell can make even the strongest people gag, hork, and vomit. Please be warned. 
Thank you for your time."

"event","since maddy is taking her sweet time to update her journal...i'm going to write in mine for lack of anything better to do. i am currently bleeding from my arm. teehee. mmm some kind of bite that has been over scratched. today..what can i say. i worked on taryn's present. it's coming along quite nicely. i'm very proud of it and would keep it if i had another idea for a present in mind. alas, i am lacking one. i shall pass the gift on to her. i still need to make a journey down to yorkville in search of something that has to do with the amazing spider man. not ultimate spiderman, or spiderman 2...but the amazing one. once i have found what i am looking for, my gift will be complete. DAMMIT. i still need to make a card. she's one of those people who likes to get cards. i'm kind of indifferent.
i need that job at sporting life. i dont think im going to get it. oy ve. and even if i do get it, its only part time...so i should probably get another part time job...somewhere...bah. 
i've seen prisoner of azkaban twice now and i didn't find it any better the 2nd time. why did i go twice, you ask? because i told ange i'd go with her. blaaaahhhhh. i just like crookshanks and buckbeak. hermione is pretty and ron is funny. i like when he's dreaming about spiders and harry says ""you tell those spiders ron."" ""yeah i'll tell em...tell em..."" and then he falls asleep again. it's funny. but really...they should have taken out that part and put in the part where sirius rips open ron's curtain in the night in search of scabbers, because that part was actually important...ugh. so inaccurrate, so disapointing. 
tonight i watched a spelling bee. i love spelling bees."

i dont wanna go back to school. i dread the end of august. i hate that stupid house. it fucking sucks. why the hell did everyone want to rent it so badly when it SUCKS MY ASS.

i don't think shrek 2 was that good. the only parts that were really good were anything with the 3 blind mice, 3 little pigs, pinnochio and the big bad wolf. i hate shrek, as a character. he thinks he's so innocent...and everyone loves him for some reason. i don't get it. man. that ogre's got nothing on Sid from ice age. 

i wish the nelly furtado would come right now. i need something exciting to happen right now. i'm not excited about camping either. starting to wonder if i should really go...i just hope my joint injections hold out, becuase if they don't, i'm screwed. 

nina comes back tomorrow. YAY. i miss nina. 

avril lavigne's new stuff is very freaking good.

"event","i was at taryn's and we downloaded all the new avril songs and stuck them onto a cd. the second track is messed up though. its a song from the first cd that just fades out, so i have a crappy second thing. but thats okay. also...i'm pretty sure most of the songs were recorded off live acoustic versions she did in some mall or something because i think i only ever hear guitar and maybe drums. i found a new song to sulk to though. it's so good. it's called ""nobody's home"". oh mother. very sad but very good. i think i may still end up buying the cd though...i dunno. i'm looking forward to someone putting the guitar tabs up on the internet soon so i can play the songs. hey. does anyone know how one can go about recording a cd without have a record deal or a label? lots of people do it, don't they? is there some studio you can just walk into? if there is, please let me know! i'm curious. like george.
ahaha. moo point. it's a moo point. it's like a cow's opinion. doesn't matter. AHAHAA. joey is my friend. hi maddy! i think you're the only one who reads this. that's nice. what is with this new gmail thing you have. and how come you're never online? and which email do you use now? you confused me! damn you! we're seeing shrek 2 tonight. other movies i want to see: harry potter, a cinderella story, saved.
teehee. teeny bopping here i come."

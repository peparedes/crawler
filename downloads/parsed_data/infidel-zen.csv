emmm. yeah. well havent now either.
was down in bangor today and nathan and cathy were there which was cool. havent seen them in a few weeks. took nathans hair out of the pony tail today just to see what it looked like and hoooly shit is it long. looks a lot shorter int he pony tail for some reason, expected it to be down to his chin. its was down past his shoulders. found a picture of kurt in HMV and they looked exactly alike.
found a few cool books in HMV too. one about bob dylan and one called ""Hippie"" which was pretty groovy.
think i shall order a few new cds of amazin soon, been into a lot of jazz recently so i must add to my collection....
was at johnnys on saturday night for the first time in damned ages, since before i broke up with rachel. wasnt too rgeat it was quite a boring night but i managed to give the other nathan a ticket to my gig to prove that i dont have any ill-will towards him and to try and bring him round to liking me maybe. think rachel and julian have something going on together which is probably annoying him a lot. i can sympathise with him, cause even though im not going out with her anymore theres always that pang in my heart that i feel when someone talks about it or something. ach well its nothing.
have invited Danny The American down to bangor on saturday as he wants to buy some spray paint to go out taggin some night. the idiot used auto paint on someones house wall at johnnys. someone will be pissed when they see it....but yeah then he is going to come back to mine with julian to watch some good ol father ted, as he has ever seen or heard of it before. we'll have to educate him :D

ah well....im going to stop typing now cause...yeah...."

ive been listening to one hell of a lot of black sabbath recently, which isnt a bad thing. the electrician is coming tomorrow to start work on putting electric down to the shed. thank god, i cant wait until its finished so i can spend all the time down there to get away from all the shit that normally happens in the house. its crazy at the minute. leo and sasha wont listen to mum and dad so its total chaos, theyre just fighting with eachother and wont respect any of the punishments theyre given. oh god i sound like a parent.
mum and dad arent exactly getting on overly well either but its the same old grind.

"event","holy shit its been a while since ive written in here. 
well im back into the same old routine of school again, the same old drag. its not that bad i suppose. had to get my haircut on thursday though :( stupid bastards in school thought it was ""too long"". ugh. well i think next year im allowed it long so it should be alright then. ill show them what long hair means! *shakes fist*.
but yes....im totally loaded with the cold with sucks a bit. 
got a new guitarist in the band, andy who lives just up the street. had our weekly practice last night and he took to all the songs really well and added his own little twist to them. we should be kick ass in time for the gig. we're being really random and going out for a pre-gig dinner the night before the gig, down in some restaurant in bangor. probably get ourselves full of ""irish cheer"", hehe. maybe hit Coyles afterwards and have a few pints and see if that amazing guitarist is playing there again.
hmmmm got oisins party tonight. its his 16th but itll probably be like an 18th. should be pretty cool, his partys normally are. the joys of the co-worker room, with a dozen german co-workers listening to music, playing pool, smokin weed (which i wont be having any of since ive been clean now for ages, bout a year and a half now) and playing their guitars. and also about 40 other people there too. should be cool.
not long until my birthday, which means ill be legally driving soon. something that is really pissing me off at the minute is all the silly little bitches and all the arseholes in school who come in and boast about the fact that they were our driving the night before, of that they are getting a new car, or that they have a driving lesson on that day. i got news for ya ""WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK!?!?!"". certainly not me.... ill show them a thing or two in my third hand shitheap of a jeep. it has a cowguard on the front :) perfect for shunting into the back of peoples cars .... :>
nah i wouldnt waste the petrol and money on doing that.

for some reason i played football in games today. i just kinda stood around, cause my hair was blowing in my eyes so i couldnt see the ball....
too many people take thatgame far too seriously. i mean, come on...its a game. but yeah i think i injured a few of the spides so its aaaall good :) bastards and their remarks - ""fokin hippie cont like, cut yer fokin hair"". hmm. i pity them and their ignorance. is that too elitist of me? dont answer that.
but now im happy, im sitting here listening to Sabbath :D :D :D ahh good ol Sabbath. I love my hippie culture. better than sitting on street corners drinking buckfast, being the lowest form of scum alive, among many other things...
cant wait until this gig, its gonna be so damn good. wiles' band had to pull out due to lack of a drummer though. but tom is getting another band to replace them, that apparently sound like Guns N Roses. also, Simsie is bringing lots of equipment we can use, fuck yeah!!! i get to use a bass stack :D:D:D:D makes me very happy. also jebs can use a half stack and ben can bring his own half stack. 
got a band practice this saturday too and i think the guys are gonna stay over too, so we should get the heavy song finished off and also be able to run through the covers. cant wait to perform Heart Shaped Box. Twill be excellent!!!!"

well, im back at school now. hmm, thats fun. last week was alright, at least im doing subjects i like now instead of all the shit i hate.
im really struggling with what to write here. god im so bored.
i got really angry yesterday, i went into an aol chatroom for some reason and it was debating what happened in Beslan the other day. all they could do was fight with eachother. there were about 2 muslims in the room and the rest were either like myself and trying to keep the peace, or they had the mentality of skinhead BNP followers. it was utterly disgusting. the muslims were saying about how much they hated jews and how it was the jews who bombed the WTC, and other dispicable things like that. meanwhile the nazis on the other side were saying the same about muslims and how they were disgusting people and all of them should be eliminated. as bad as eachother. it would make me lose total faith in the human race if i didnt know that not everyone is like that. it almost made me sick, but i was so angry that i couldnt do anything about it or make them see that they were completely wrong, and that is the mentality that starts off extremists, and then we end up with another 9/11 or Beslan. ugh."

<P>talking of school, yeah, starting back tomorrow. in a way im looking forward to it because there are 23 new people which are coming into the year which should be interesting. also that means that 23 of the fuckin assholes from the year have been flushed out of the system.

"event","Chris came round tonight and we just chilled down towards the beach which was really good. Sat and talked about loads of different things. Was really great. Hell we do it all the time but it still is cool and relaxing each time. When we were walking back home we walked past a bunch of assholes sitting on the beach who were either our age or a year younger, and were tying to keep a fire lit on the beach. They somehow didnt grasp that they had to put more wood in it....and when they threw seaweed in it that it wasnt going to work. Its when you look at people like that you lose total faith in the competence of the human race. Imbociles. Well the results come out on tuesday and everyone else is clucking like a bunch of startled chickens and trying to seek attention by pretending theyre going to fail miserably when they know and everyone else knows that they will pass with flying colours. Stupid bitches. Ah well. Its strange but I'm actually looking forward to going back to school, because I'll only be doing four subjects which I really love and also there'll probably be a few new people in school. One of them being Nathan...hmm, there will almost definately some friction there. Oisin and Julian tell me he still hates me, but with absolutley no reason for it, just because its easy to let old grudges lie the way they do. He's doing 3 of the same subjects as me too so there's a good chance that he will be in at least one of my classes. Whoop! They tell me he always speaks of me with such hate and says he is going to ""beat the crap out of me"" and that he always gives me ""evil glares"", but i never notice any such hatred coming from him at all. It will be interesting.
Whoopy, just made a deal with Jane that I'll lend her a few books over the school terms now. She's becoming way more interested in the things I am such as history and politics. Tis really groovy to have someone else to talk about those things with."

But I figure that since Ozzy Sabbath was so much better than Dio Sabbath, that there needs to be a counter song. So I wrote one.....
Orion!!!!!! Fuck yeah, listening to Robert Trujillo doing his bass solo bit at the Dublin 2004 Metallica concert. Fuckin hell it was a mindblowing concert :D :D :D
The crowd went absolutley wild when they heard him playing the bassline from Orion. We love you Cliff Burton!!!
But anyway, yeah, I might post the song up when I've fully written it and done a few run-throughs with the band."

Printing out some mindless cap for dad about the yacht club regatta. woooot. sorry, that sounded wrongly sarcastic..... :|
Fucking rain won't stop. I need a dry day so I can finish sanding the shed and then paint it. Will be quite groovy when it's finished. Got a fridge for it now, and a TV, and two massive speakers. Got some ideas for paintings on the wall inside too which should be fuckin-A. 
Anywho..."

"event","Once more I'm feeling empowered by the bond that unknown metallers have with eachother. It's almost unspoken.
Take, for example, when I was in Dublin to see Metallica. The day after the concert I was walking around the city centre and people I saw that I didn't know were nodding at me and saying ""hey"" and ""alrite man"" to me. Also at the concert, I just started talking to people I hadn't a fucking clue who they were, but felt a mutual bond because we shared a love of the same music and lifestyle. 
Even now when I listen to the live CD of the concert, I get a tingle down my spine because I feel like I belong to something thats so fucking huge and so amazing. When I listen to the songs and hear the crowd singing twice as loud as the band, it just makes me feel so fucking good, it makes me feel like I belong."

"event","I have been thinking about dreams a lot recently.
Some people think that its really weird that I dream in colour all the time, because they dream in black and white.
What does this mean? Are their minds mot complex enough to dream in colour? What about the people who sometimes dream in colour and sometimes in black and white? 
The mind boggles....
I've always dreamt in colour. Indeed."

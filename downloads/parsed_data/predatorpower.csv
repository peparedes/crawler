I can't say that you let me down, because I stopped trusting you after the fifth relapse. Things were doing so well, you were doing so well. There's no excuse for you to rewind all of that progress. You don't have a disease, this isn't all about you, no one out there is deliberatley trying to hurt you. Take care of your family, take care of you. I've been forgiving as much as humanly possible. I want to step up and be the parent? I'd probably do a much better job than yourself.

If there's one thing you've taught me, it's that people don't change."

"event","has been home to many firsts:
first wild vulture sighting
first time watching an autistic man with ""silent turrets""
first time meeting pluto the dog
first time missing my twin in the past five months
first ride in a 12 seater dune buggie
first time smelling a sea lion
first time being in a controlled elevator that dropped 10 stories
first time giving a nacho platter to a homeless man
and for my personal favorite, first time seeing THE VANS WARPED TOUR audience in san francisco, hahah tight black pants and messy hair everywhere, it was so horrible


i would have pictures, but i dont know how to put them up. brittany, you teach me when i get back. anyway, it's not a lot to brag about. i miss everyone more than i ever have, and just knowing that i have to go back to renton afterwards makes me want to lock monique in a cage for an extra week. i havent been able to use the phone and/or computer for a while.

next stop: sea world!
hahaha, my parents reserved a ""dinner with shamu"""

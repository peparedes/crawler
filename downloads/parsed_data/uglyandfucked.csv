Electric company

There's a place for us they say is somewhere
Not a dream but a place and you will be there
Your slippin' but content because your spirit
And hills are alive with the sound of music
+ what was the first song you heard by 8?: honestly, i don't know...  my dad had records when i was a kid but i'll hafta say it was probably stairway"

what a weekend
work was retarded, i thought i was going to shit myself saturday night
looked at apartments (sort of) on thurs with fitz, and he is following up on one tomorrow. i would go but i have to work.  of course.
went out fri sat sun night.  thought sunday would be more laid back, being a sunday and all but it turned out to be the most redonk of them all.
came home progressivly later each night, sunday night/monday morning the sun was up by the time she left
i was the fucking walking dead tonight at work but i rocked it out... didn't have a floater so i did my shit and helped the other cooks. which is pretty cool cuz i'm def the newest/greenest/most inexperienced, and i also don't know their positions.
umm 
big up bill's pizza and OPT.
went to a house party saturday night with her and other work peeps.... totally teabaggish except for kanye on repeat in the stereo
there was a huge budweiser banner on the wall
fags
umm
also people from the wa-v that almost got facefucked
i was all for it but didn't want to fight
why do we waterville people talk so much shit
tyson is the coolest dog ever
some guy walked up to me at the mall and pointed out his anticon hoodie, saying ""is this the same shit?"" (i was weating an anticon shirt)
seems like a cool kid, told him i was i a hurry to get back to work but i'd see him at e&a with any luck

that's right.
der what has happened since last i updated
chan's graduation is coming up...may 16 
you should come... me and fitzy are going, so eveyone else should too.  unless you live in like philly or western nc...
i'm a chef at MacGrill.  and since it's an open-concept kitchen, you can come watch me work.  and the food there is insanely good... i'm lucky to finally work in a cool restaurant. consisdering i started at mcdonalds.
apparently i only miss you when no one else is around.  did it occur to you that 1that's not true and b... no one else is ever around?
fucking... i have to help my mom and sister do like... handyman shit at the gym... funny consisering i failed shop and my birdhouse looked somewhat like a mousetrap
 
if you're old school, and you're metal, you'll be at the D.R.I show in july... purchased the probot album also... dave grohl makes surprisingly good metal with excellent choices for singers.  including lemmy, mike dean, max cavallera, the dude from d.r.i.... like 9 others i can't remember... the guy from morbid angel,i beleive, and the guy from venom.

looking for apt's in portland later this week 
if you hear/know of anything pleeeeeeeeeease let me know, i'm about to have a breakdown living here.   

wow this is actually an entry... i never do this, i always mumble random shit

i need to puchase un bicicleta... i want a bmx, but  i think i'm gonna try to get my beater back from ama's grandparents too 
i left lots of stuff with her...like a brand new fridge and a dresser i had soncei was born... actually i think my parent's had it before i was born 
and my sexy messenger bag... which was replaced by a much less sexy one... 


ok now i'm rambling, that's more what i'm used too 

umm i guess fitz has been jamming with mike from the taxis... 
we need to get pornoface rockin hard when we get to portland. ifonly we didn't just lose the majority ofmembers to devil worship and self-immolation... i mean bangor and wa-v.  yep it's really cool when your bestest friends just bail on you for no real reason without talking to you about it.  

so i took an iq test and i guess i'm a visionary philosopher... so if you girls are down for some visions and some philosophising with your make-outs... 




alana...iwant to come to your birthday... i don't know if working will allow it tho, as lame a reason as that is

i left my atm card in an atm... i'm really smart
i guess they hold it for 3 days and then destroy it
i can think of some things i'd like to do that to...hold for three days then destroy

I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from work. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's ten thousand photographs of my cat.

I want to say thanks to simon and Abbey and Dave and the other Simon for helping me on Saturday. You guys are the best. By the way, if you happen to find my wallet, keys or underwear, could you SMS me? Adrian has my number. 

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with my favourite Buffy fan-fiction piece I wrote last year when I was in hospital.

You are<br>an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for<br>one reason or another - possibly, you made one<br>tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.

the only good thing that's come of it are 2 shows, and getting to see people i missed

there. 

so the show was alright, even tho i was warned not to go. there were too many people there and a lot of them that didn't know how tried to dance.  i have the biggest bruise on my elbow, i wish i could post a pic... it's like the size of a damn melon, it's fucking brutal  i can't really move my arm much either, my shoulder is fucking sore, i this i like strained all the muscles that attatch to a shoulder.
mpb, the 1 band i hadn't seen yet didn't show up.  superstitions had merch but didn't play... that would have more than made up for mpb. fata was pretty good, they played good songs of TFWL, not bad ones

jenna is the best hugger ever... it's the feeling that she's never gonna let go...
happy b-day, again.
 
watch roger dodger, it's already in my top 10 movies
anybody in southern maine wanna hang out??? call me please, i have moday and tuesday off 415 3702

Eigth Level of Hell - the Malebolge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."

Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor: 
It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye. 

I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, 
An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. 
Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', 
Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'. 
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, 
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. 
Take everything that this world has to give. 
I wanna take every breath I can get: 
I wanna live."

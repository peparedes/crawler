Chillin back at home in my GV-Tech Safe till I get back, along with a MILSPEC LASERMAX PULSE SIGHT, which replaces the stock recoil rod for some pretty kickass POA.


Cant wait to come back and play with the bitch, lock and load up some 125g Federal HD-Max JHP and send that bitch downrange at 1650fps.

"event","I never expected opening my locked closets would do this to me.

It took so many years to find all the keys, and find the courage to use them. 

And now i relive it. Every minute of everything comes back when i close my eyes.

I fear nothing i can see, nothing i can reach out and touch; aim at and kill.

But now it comes back, i fear what i remember. And even more than that, i fear the nightmares that remembering brings.  

Now i recall why i hid them away, why i locked them up and lost the keys in the dark. It was because i never planned to go find them again.

I remember why i hate god, and i remember why i was scared to sleep. Its because its the one thing the hurting can take from you.

I let it all out for her, so she could be the first to see what i couldnt undertand, because i didnt remember. Look what its done to me, and look how it doesnt even seem like she knows.
I need to find help, but i ran out of options years ago. Every night, when i close my eyes, there they are. Every last one, just waiting."

Dont be offended if i dont respond to comments, ill try to adress them in posts since i cant reply to stuff over my cell for some reason. if someone doesnt have my new celly # email me if you want it, i got yahoo working on my celly too.         woot, about 6 bradleys just rolled by.

anywho, incase anyone still sees this, reply with a memory of me. Funny is better, cuz i could use a laugh. And keep it clean, this is a family enviroment. Bitches. <3"

"event","A Jamestown man is behind bars this hour, charged with an unthinkable form of child abuse.
Police say he not only molested a young girl, but also broadcast it live on the internet.

The FBI arrested 55 year old James Lindgren for the crime. Agent Peter Ahearn says Lindgren sought out networks of people on the internet who were interested in child sexual abuse and then arranged a time where they could watch him abuse a little girl live on the internet and even email and direct him as to what to do to the child.

""He took his own personal perversions to a new level,"" says Ahearn.

Police are not relasing the name of the victim, nor her relationship to Lindgren. They will not search for those who took part in the internet abuse. ""They can be prosecuted,"" says Ahearn, ""whether they were in San Francisco, L.A. or Moscow. They can be indicted and charged in the district of Western New York and I believe that's the intention of the U.S. Attorney's office.""

Channel 2's Laura Steele spoke with Lindgren's neighbors in Jamestown. Click on the video link to watch her report."

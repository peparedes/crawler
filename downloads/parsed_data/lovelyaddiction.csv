"event","it seems like it's been forever, maybe it has, I don't know.  over a month anyway.  I feel really silly tonight, and I can't really explain why.  I got high yesterday, I guess you could say that anyway.  I smoked weed.  weed.  I'm fucking bland.  what the hell am I doing smoking weed?! and I kissed her again.  or maybe she kissed me.  it doesn't seem to matter, really.  every time greg said ""gina, you're shot"" I cracked up.  It was so funny.  I was shot, I guess, maybe.  Low tolerance is good when you're just trying to prove mommy and daddy wrong. I am NOT a bad time to be around.  I am fun.  I am interesting.  Everyone likes me.  Maybe.  She does anyway.  And her boyfriend said that he'd go out with me if I were straight and if he didn't have a girlfriend. I guess I should feel lucky, or something, but I just feel really really dirty.  I'll never really understand the two of them, and how they seem to want me to  be a part of whatever they have.  it kind of makes me vaguely nauseous, if it didn't intrigue me so damn much.  I need a boy or a girl, or something to keep my mind off of the sick and twisted world of alaina and brian.  I told him all about my weed-smoking.  I told myself that I wasn't going to, so I can't imagine what's wrong with me.  I guess I just wanted to tell someone, get it off my chest.  But I couldn't really get rid of it all, because he doen't know my story, morning fucking glory. I'm goddamned tired, but I feel as though I have to keep typing. I don't even know why.  It seems like my mind is moving faster than my fingers, which is something of an odd sensation.  I think danielle said that once, about the mind moving faster than the fingers.  Wendy said, ""you liked that danielle, didn't you gina?""  and I said fuck yeah, wendy.  I'd take her back if she came back tomorrow.  just because I'm a sucker like that.  it's really time to go to sleep. leave daddy passed out on the couch.  fucking lush parents.  they wonder why I want to go away to college.  god, they'll never ever get it.  11:50.. good evening my no ones.  no one reads my live journal but me anyway, so it seems kind of in vain.  in vain indeed."

I fucking love ani.
dammit.
and I miss her.
Not ani, of course, but the girl that I'd give up everything for..
The girl.
And sure I like the boy.
Sure, he's a great guy.
But.  There's nothing in my past to indicate that I would like that.
It's something like a college student, I think, deciding after already taking so many credits to  change their major.  It's like starting over.  And that's what a relationship with him would be like..  starting over completely.
She always asks how he is, like I know.
I don't know how he is, we don't have very deep and profound conversations.
He pulled a hamstring, and now he can't run for a while.  If that counts.  And he's dealing with the inner turmoil of his ex coming back to ruin his life for a second time.. *god have I been there*
But I don't know why she always asks. I think that she thinks that I like him.  And I do like him.  I like him a lot.
But for every high opinion I have of him,
I have ten that are ten times higher of her.
If that makes sense. 
I am crazy about her. 
And I wish she was (still) crazy about me.
I could have had her back in like january.
And I did have a lot of her back in like january.
lol.
but I lost her, along with my mind when that god-damned wench of an ex-girlfriend came back.
*sigh*
maybe it just wasn't meant to be.
maybe I just wasn't meant to be."

"event","my parents came home last night wasted.  but then, what the fuck else is new.

at 6 AM their alarm went off, but I was the only one losing sleep over it.
so I went into my mother's room, my father nowhere to be found, presumably on the couch downstairs,
and my mother was lying across the width of her bed while the alarm blared.
and I turned it off, slightly nauseated by the reminder of my parents immaturity,
and extremely irritated that my life has to be lived like this.
And when I woke up again,
I found that my father had baked 6 dozen cookies for my mother to take to some party because my mother had been too hung over.
And he recalled quietly how she had fought with him last night over trivial things and insisted that he slept downstairs.
She laughed kind of nervously
as she realized that
she didn't remember last night at all.

some people have asked me why I don't drink and I don't smoke and I basically stick to all that is good and wholesome in life.
And I don't understand how they couldn't understand that I don't want to be like my parents.
I don't want to wake up one morning and realize that I am my mother's daughter.

And I never want anyone to view me with such disgust as I view the two low-life middle-class losers that I have spawned from.  

of course, that's no excuse.  I'm a teenager.  teenagers do bad things.  I'm abnormal now."

And you tell me that you want me and you said that you only went out with <i>him</i> because things weren't going too well with me.  Well, if you'd let them go well, they would.

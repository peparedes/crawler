Dear Eddy,

You must be the biggest pussy ever. You think that making fun of me will make people like you more? I'm not the only one who thinks that you and others are Seans little followers. With titles such as ""Gregg's Odor"", youd think you could say it to my face, but no, you have to be a little dick about it. If you have something to say, say it to me. Im used to getting made fun of but not by someone who smells worse than I do. Eddy, you even pretend to be my friend when nobodys around...i take that back...when SEANYS not around. If sean doesnt like me, so be it...but that doesnt mean you have to follow him. Sean is not god and you dont have to follow and hang on his every word. Youre like a fucking animal begging for attention. Some people wont even look or talk to you because the honestly said you have messed up teeth, bad breath, and you smell bad. And i forgot...who do you hang out with outside of school? Seany and alex? Your mom and dad? Yea...So next time you feel the need to post something about me...tell me before hand.

Thanks,
Gregg"

wrong turn
tonight we spin around
dance on icy roads
crawl through darkness
tonight we leave
we go on trips of life
eternity is through
but the past
has not yet begun
so tonight we sleep
on pillows of concrete
with a matress
made of flesh 
we lie together
on corpses and cars
tonight we wake up
we complete the tasks
and rape the minds
of the overindulgers
the self righteous
racists and killers
we go to bed
tonight
forgetting always
about waking up tomorrow

WHOO WHOOT! rakes are cool. we were going to visit jon and we were like 1 minute away from his house and he called eric and said he cant come out. so seany hopped in the cart and i pushed him down the hill and after seany got to his feet, we were going to take the kart on the slide but then the 5-0 showed up and called seany over. i stood still and jairus ran. so she made seany take it back so i went wiht. then the lady officer made fun of mine and seanys big feet. and we went back to the park for awhile then walked to erics. we chilled there for awhile. we then took this 20 lb. lead pipe and a basketball and played ""lead pipe ball"" in erics driveway/my backyard. seany fell on his face which was the highligh tof my day. so then seany and jairus left and then jackie like an hour later. now i left and am here. o yea...harmony and travis were in the picture but they were all touchy-feely do they didnt talk much so maybe thats why i didnt notice them. well i got to go sleep. peace out kidds.

"event","well sam hates me because...who doesnt? she came up to me and told me soemthing serious but i thought she was joking becasue this statement came from nowhere. so jokingly, i said something that i thought would fit, due to the fact i thought it was a joke. but it turns out she was serious and she cried the rest of the day. well  hearing that i made her felt so miserable, i felt so bad, mentally. i threw up like 3 times. i suck at life. im the worst person i know.

i apologize as sincerely as possible to sam and dave. i didnt mean to say shit so how about ill just go die? that would make sam happy. if i had a knife, i would stab my lips shut so i could never say anything to make you cry again. and i dont understand how one of them could forgive me but the other one is obsessed with the 6 words i said. and everyone had to remind me of this all day.

so now i feel like shit and i want to slice out my eyes and bleed to death in this chair. but other than that...have a peaceful, non-hating day. there is enough hatred directed towards me as it is.

"event","Friday was Halloween and I was ""Sergeant Sexy"" (the name of the costume), or a cop.  I had guns, a baton, handcuffs, a walkie-talkie.. and all that good stuff.  After work I went to a party with Mike where there were a gazillion people.  I felt a little uncomfortable but Mike took care of me.  :)   Then the next day Christine and I went to breakfast at First Watch and then started our drive to Miami at around 11 am.  We got there around 1 so it wasn't that bad of a drive.  We drove around endlessly trying to find a place to stay since all the hotels we saw were really shady.  We finally found some nice ones on Miami Beach but problem was that my friend had told me that I had to be 21 to rent a room.  So I just struted my stuff and I got a room at the Marriott.  So Christine and I got settled and started getting ready to go out.  We went downstairs to get my car from valet and the owner of the hotel started talking to us about what there was around town that we could do and he told us about this Club Tropigala that had a Cirque de Solie? kinda entertainment with dinner included in the cover charge.  Since we were interested, he said he was treat us.  So we decided we woul do that but we got to talking to the valet boys who told us about the much much better clubs to go to.  So they gave us directions to South Beach but then a limo man asked us if we wanted a ride with him to an Italian restaurant called Sopranos.  Of course we accepted and went to dinner there and got sat without waiting and got our dinner served before all the others because we were, as the owner put it ""beautiful ladies... so beautiful... like flowers... you are our flowers, ::kisses our hands::""  He ordered us drinks as well which was a nice addition to the Canes' loss.  !! :D  

Then we went back to the hotel and took a half hour nap and then went downstairs to get the car but we ran into the University of Louisville soccer players and coaches.  We talked to them for a bit and they decided to go to the clubs with us.  I drove to South Beach with all of them and I made them pay for our parking.  (hehehehe) We walked around, without ID's and got into all the clubs but one.  Not did we only get into the clubs but we also were VIP. Amazingly fun.  I met tons of men.  Men men men.  And my favorite was the one from Houston, Texas... in the Marine Corps.  mmmmmmmmmm.  After Christine and I couldn't walk anymore we met the soccer boys at Mango and took a few pictures.  Since everything was closing, the cops were all around watching everyone,including Christine and me.  So this cop... Officer Scott decided he would hit on us while I was with the English soccer guy... Simon? and take me out to his car where he took pictures of him frisking and handcuffing me.  It was fun.  Everyone around me thought I was being arrested.  He drove us back to our cars and we picked up the soccer boys and went back to the hotel.  Simon was kinda mad but there was nothing he could do about it.  He was a mix of Ewan McGregor and Nick Lachey with an English accent that sounded totally Australian that was mmm so hot.  Christine and I were so ready to go to bed since it was 630 but these 2 guys insisted that we go to the beach.  After I threw them out, they continued to knock and yell for at least a half hour.  They called the room over and over so it was so hard for us to sleep.  But they eventually stopped and we went to IHOP and ate sooo much food.  We never got to go shopping though.  :(   This Friday Christine and I are leaving for HOTlanta and hopefully since we'll be there for more than one night, we'll have even more fun and boys."

I have this amazing picture that I took one day driving home from shopping that I'll have to post.  It kinda reminds me of the Lion King.  And the song then pops in my head.  Aaaay za wenya!  I went shopping yesterday in Orlando and got shirts from FCUK.  One says, ""fcuk Safely"" on the front and on the back, ""don't be a lover without a safety cover.""  Heh.  The other just says flying fcuk.  :)  I got my brother one that says too busy to fcuk.  Of course Christine got one that says hot as fcuk.  That's just her though.  Hehe.  I totally enjoyed my 3 days free of work.  I have to go to Dr. Elstein's in about a half hour.  I guess after that I'll do a little more shopping.  I gotta start reading Brave New World too.

We totally listened to my Kenny Chesney on the way to the movie and back.  We tried to watch the sunset but I was too late :(   I'm going to see that movie again.  It seemed really long though.  Was it really 2 hours and 45 min or am I that bad at judging time.  OH!  This ice cream place across from the Hollywood 20 has to have some of the most amazing ice cream!  You haaaaaaave to go!  Mike and I shared this mint chocolate chip thing and wowee.  They scooped the mint ice cream and then added the chocolate chips and smooshed it and stuff and made it mint chocolate chip!"

It was so bizarre.  Then I took this random woman a few blocks down to pay her rent at 3 AM?  and back to the hotel.  She had called a cab but she asked me if I'd take her there and so I decided why not.  I was such a nice girl tonight.  I think I might be going to Ybor with Kristen and her boyfriend tomorrow.

I have guys visiting me today.  I'm excited to see them.  Too bad it's raining because I was going to go to the beach with Kristen.

Last night was so much fun for some reason.  One of our bussers had to bring people to their cars with an umbrella and he came back totally drenched a couple hours later after the rain had finally stopped.  It was only his second day too.  We had a different key manager that night so maybe that was why.  He made some kinda comment about my cleavage so that was a little fishy but other than that he was super fun.  I think we have a tornado warning.  

I had a dream last night that a bunch of my friends and I went on a road trip to some foreign place.  We drove there and it was across some ocean so we couldn't figure a way to get our car and ourselves back.  Then we forgot to pay for the hotel so we had to go back. and I didn't have to pay because I will have been paying for the gas on the way back.  But we weren't driving back so I didn't get it.

Moreover, some people don't know how to keep their mouths shut when they need to.  Some things are personal and wanted to be kept that way for a reason.  It doesn't feel too peachy when my thoughts that I don't know many people that I'm acquanted with can be trusted are forified.  It just reassures me that I have to keep more thoughts and incidents to myself and only talk to the one person I could ever trust about it.  Hell, I don't even know if I should be trusting that person.

Christine have been hanging with them for the past few days but they finally left yesterday but of course Christine and I were working at Outback so we didn't get to say bye.

Cobalt/Prom is on Saturday and I only have my dress.  I don't know if I want to get the dressed hemmed or not.  I need shoes and jewelery and an idea for hair and all that jazz. 

I want to go to a country concert.  I've never been to one.  But more than that, I wanna go to a Midtown concert.  Or TSL concert.  Simple Plan would be peachy too.  OhohoHOhohohoh and Linkin Park.  But since I've only been to two concerts (one including eminem *bleeech*) I don't see my attending a good concert anytime soon.  School's starting right now.  I should really go.  But I have an appointment in 20 minutes.  It's sad when I want to go to school because I know I'm missing a lot of instruction.  Oh man! I'm going to miss Gilmore Girls because I'm going to be cramming for that exam tomorrow.  Sux to my asthmar.  Piggy, blow the conch!  I miss that book.   

I hate the popo.  Ha, I made a typo and typed poop.  I amuse myself.  The Taproot lead singer has a unique voice.

"event","I have to stop working some day.  I'm so exhausted lately.  I was hoping i would have a day off of working on Saturday but Scott asked me to go into Outback because he fired someone. I still haven't figured out who it is though.    I've had to buy a tank of gas in the past two days and my tank is already asking for more.  Kyle left me an Easter egg, but i dropped it because I'm an idiot.  Even with all this working, I'm still low on cash.  I dont quite understand why.  Yesterday was Easter on 4/20.  Hehe.  I still think that's funny.  At work yesterday, these girls came in that were soooooooooooo ooooooooooooooo stupid.  I was so ready to kick them out of the restaurant.  I thought that I could be ditzy and dumb sometimes but I didn't even come close.  They were pretty much naked too.  I wanted to ask them to put clothes on. Now I gotsa go to a doctor's appointment.

I worked with Christine and Caitlin so that was lots of fun.  We watched Jose work.  He's such a cutie.  hehe JK.   Lilly and Joan stopped by for a little bit but I was rolling silver.  That ounds like some kinda new drug imbibition.  I don't think that's a word.  So there's a guy that I like that I shouldn't like but should at the same time.  Makes me think too much.  I wish the guys would just flock to me and I would take my pick out of all of them.  That would be so much fun!  I haven't slept in a while.  It's tough stuff.  I would sleep in tomorrow but I have to work 9-12 at the dermatologist.  My grades are dropping.  Something that you would never expect.  I'm planning on going to the beach tomorrow with the girls after work.  Then after that, I come home to get ready to go to work on St. Armands.  I have my AP Bio mock on Thursday but I don't know when I'm going to get studying done for that when I'm working my butt off.  I could pass up the beach but that's more or less Fran time that is very much needed.  I think I need some GIlmore Girls."

"event","I got to watch a surgery at work.  Dr. Elstein did an excision of a wicked cyst.  The nurses were telling me about how the cysts usually splode and go everywehre and the whole exam room starts to smell.  But this cyst came out fine.  It was bizarre how they cut open such a large area and she didn't bleed as much as I imagined she would.  Maybe the cort helped?  Possibly.  But they cauterized the vessels and that was cool because she was totally smokin'.  Not smokin' as in inhaling toxic chemicals or smokin' like incredibly hot but like smokin' on fire smokin'.  Of course she wasn't on fire though... althoughthat would have been interesting.  I really thought it was interesting when they were holding open the wound with tools.  It was such a good day at work!  Not to mention that I get paid to watch procedures that I love observing.  I had to wear this yellow robe because absolutely everything in the room had to be sterile.  The nurse even sterilized a lamp.  It makes sense though since the patient's wound was pretty big.  The connective tissue looked really tough and almost sticky.  I can't seem to compare human connective tissue to that of our pigs we had in anatomy last year.  I'm still blown away by how amazing it was!  I'm such a dork.  :)  He he.  :)

I have orientation for Outback on Sunday at 11:00.  It might be tough working quatro trabajos pero it'll keep my mind occupied and... a long story follows that but I'll just pretend that I told you aboot it.  

I think I'm going to buy a guest ticket for Cobalt and if I can't find a supercalifragilously sensationally gorgeous man, I'll give the ticket to  a  supercalifragilously sensationally gorgeous Mari or Annie?  I would call to see if they still need another ticket but she's working.  If we only had decent bachelors at Pine View... or just decent boys...pwwwwth"

Maybe a kitten will do the trick.  Oh, I was at the beach with Annie and Mari for an hour today too.  Christine was supposed to go but she had to go to work at Outback.  Annie wa sso checking this guy out the whole time who had wicked killer abs so I decided to ask him if he wanted my friend and he was polite but up close.. oh man.  He had this tooth that was sideways or inverted or.. I couldn't really figure it out but it was not hot.  Total Monet.  Can't believe I just said that.  Anyhoo, Kyle stopped by after I babysat.  It made me feel a little better, even though we kinda just sat there watching tv.  I'm so pooped after babysitting Abby and Lindsy.  I don't think I've ever been running around for that many hours.   Aside from work but girls just wear me out more?  I have so much to do tomorrow. Damn it.  and damn it."

"event","Your first name of Fran has made you a friendly, approachable, and generous person. Generally you are good-natured, though at times you can be blunt and sarcastic. As you are naturally talkative, you find it easy to meet and make friends with many people. This name inclines you to be sympathetic and generous to those in difficult or unfortunate circumstances. You can be firm, positive, and independent in your own ideas and in reaching your own decisions, yet when it comes to taking action or following things through to completion, you often need encouragement. You respond quickly to kind words or any appreciation shown you. There are artistic, creative abilities in this name that you could express through music or singing, or, in a practical way, through sewing or interior decorating. You enjoy freedom from monotony and are stimulated by unexpected opportunities for meeting people, entertaining, or pursuing activities of a carefree nature. In your work, you find it difficult to be neat and orderly. You rarely plan things ahead of time, or follow a routine. Emotion and feeling, the desire to be carefree, friendly, and happy, are the driving forces in your being, rather than shrewdness, ambition, and material success. You could experience headaches, or problems with your teeth, ears, eyes, or sinuses. Health weaknesses relative to the functioning of the liver could appear. 

Problems with my teeth!  Gasp!  
Yes no?

I saw a lotta bikes riding together in the Villiage.  They seemed really pompous, haughty, arrogant, very macho.  Muchisimo.  I think that's the word.  At first I was like mmm... then when they talked I was more like mmm no.  Oh well.  I was at Munchies before that.  It was alright.  I wasn't really allowed to eat the salad that I got because it was kinda salty but I didn't bother with ordering something else.  Nice waiter though.  I tried going shopping today but found nothing that I liked.  I'm really full right now and I'm gonna watch Friends and Gilmore Girls and try to sleep.   I hope Dean and Rory get back together.  He's such a hunk.... he's so dreaaaamy."

We walked around the villiage for a little bit and when we were walking towards our car to leave, these two guys asked us about the clubs in Sarasota and so we talked to them for a little while.  They're from Kansas and go to the university in Kansas City?  Something like that.  They were pretty cool. I had to take Christine home so she wasn't late for her curfew so those guys were left to talk to Taryn and Christina.  They came over to say hi but we had to leave so I felt kinda rude.  Oh well.   Christine and I are pretty close now.  Asian Invasion.. haha.  I have so much work to do over spring break.  Shouldn't they let us relax over a break?  Oy.

"event","Yesterday was a really  long day, not a bad one tho.  I woke up at 8 to go look at cars with my dad.  Oh, I got my car back too.  It was so shiny, it looked spanking new.  But I didn't get to drive it yesterday because my parents took it with them to work.  That made me angry, but it is really their car so I shouldn't have been.  So then I came home and studied a little for bio.  (I'm such a nerd)  Then... my brother and Jason woke up and we watched a little tv and then I made Will get ready so we could start out day... at around 2, I think.  So we went to Jason's to eat and for him to de-stinkify.  Then... we went to this shoe store place.  I didn't have my shoes on though because I was in Alex's car and my shoes were in my brother's car.  So I had to go in without shoes on.   It probably was not the best move because it was kinda gross.  Then.. we went to Southpointe and we got to test drive a 325i 5 speed and a 323i auto.  They were super nice.  Marvilloso.  Then.. we went to South Gate, or Westfield.  I like Westfield because of the kangaroos and little carts that kids can ride in that are cars with faces.  I wish I had those to ride in when I was younger.  Anyhoo, I was disappointed because I was all ready to buy cute stuff but they didn't have anything that I liked.  :(  Then we went to Publix to buy stuff for Jason's barbeque.  I never kenw grocery shopping could be so much fun.  I now have a new hobby!  Hehe.  Joan called and then Lilly called and I didn't have a car to get anywhere so I couldn't really get to where they were going and do what I was supposed to do that night.  I asked them if they wanted to go to the barbeque and I don't know what they all ended up doing because they never called to tell me.  That kinda upset me but Christine called also and she brought Annie with her to the barbeque so that was cool.  We ate soooo much.  I think I may have gained 18 pounds in one day.  Then around 10 Christine, Annie and I went to the village and walked around and talked to a some guys.  I missed doing that with them.  But then Christine had to go home :(  So Christine took ey back to Jason's and then Jason's let me drive his SC430 to Alex's house.  It was so nice to drive.  Driving it made me want to get a convertible, but I just don't like how soft tops look with the tops up.  I wouldn't be able to get a hard top like Jason's so.. pwwttth.  We ate some more at Alex's house and watched some Austin Powers movie.  Of course it was horrible.  It was awesome seeing my brother, Kyle, Matt, Jason, and Graham again.  I totally missed hanging out with them.  Like totally.  ;)   We came home at 4 and I watched the end of 10 Days to Lose a Guy since no one would see it with me at the movies.  It was cute but I expected it to be more girly.   I love the super sappy girly movies.  My legs are really sore for some reason.  Yesterday would have been perfect if Lilly, Joan and the others called me to tell me what they were doing.  I haven't reallydone  anything with them in aeither.  I was kinda rude on the phone but as everyone knows, I can't help doing the emotional thing right now.  I hope they understand that, but maybe they won't. Let's hope they do.   Aiiyy yaaaah.  (<-- Chinese) But I got to see Christine and Annie so :)   Christine and I are getting to be even better friends, which is fantastic because we understand each other a lot since we're both Asian.  Hehe.   I'm gonna go make something to eat."

"event","After a desgustingly long Hiatus, Andrew is back! Oh yes! I hear the screams of joy right now as i sit here, contemplating my fated fated exam timetable.
So, what brought about the big change, i hear you cry?! Well. for one, i like my LJ..it gives me something to do..and it makes me seem interesting and intellectual. And also i can offload my ""streeeess"" onto someone other than Julia. 
Talking of the McKie's, Lettie is back soon! Any of you who don't know, Lettie is one of my ""new friends"" (so aptly anemd by my ""old friends"") whom i had the delight of meeting whilst in a local am-dram production. Terribly posh, educated at boarding school and so much fun, and in the village! And, the adventurous Lettie has been in Africa for the last 3 months, so am quite excited about her return.
Got an invite to Abbey's 18th today-am v fearful about going as Tonbridge in general scares me (as anyone who knows me will tell you) and also large groups of people that slight bit older tahn me scare me, and being a loner scares me, too. So this is why i am quite worried. I was hoping Julia. POlly, Ema nd the whole ""rah-rah"" PAMELA crew would go...but alas, i think it will be me and MAiread. And she knows everyone.
Talking of am-dram, am going for an audition on Tuesday for ""snow white"" to be put on in November. Am thinking of Roger the HUntsman...apparently he is a camp character. Im sure several people will be very pissed off if i dont get it!
Anyway, that was my ""update"". Huge loves to all of my minions!

I had some SHOCKING news yesterday. I went shopping in Tun.Wells with Anna and Sarah Doody. We went to river island which was a complete disaster-everything i tried on (large sizes here people) just didnt fit well or suit me. They were all tight clingy material and i felt awfully downtrodden. You have to be perfect to shop in places like that. Body perfect. :(. I told Anna to carry on into camden road so we could go to the camping shop-in order for me to buy a tent for myself.
Later on, whilst talking with Doody monster, we discussed my unfortunate ex. Shock horror, Doody told me that whilst we were going out Lewis had told her he fancied her. When i asked him about this he admitted it! OH THE INSANITY! I could have screamed. 
When life hands you lemons, start making lemonade! 
And incidentally, as Miss Beddingfield is on the radio, i have one comment to make about her new song. She can't say hyperbole properly. It is pronounced ""hyperr-bo-lee"", not, as she thinks, ""hyper-bowl"". Sounds like a bigger version of the american super bowl. Ghastly. My advice to Miss B would be, If you are going to say it, say it right.

Had i very pleasant weekend. On friday my friend joe came over, and we made a cake! One of my passions in life-cooking in general, but i do love cakes. This was a lemon drench cake, and was delicious. Afterwards we sat in the garden and lit all the candles and fairy lights, and sat at the nice bistro table my mother just bought. It was very nice, and such a warm evening. We chatted about various things, cabbages and kings, to quote Lewis Carrol. Then we consumed our efforts-it was a very nice cake. Everyone else thought so too!

On saturday i went out with the Americans-what fun (?!) we pottered around sevenoaks. I was counting all the lustful looks that Clare got off  men, 32 in total for sevenoaks-minus the bitchy looks she gets off from girls. She says it happens everywhere! Its her fault for being a leggy blonde with very glamourous clothes.

"event","I have been lazy yet again! I'm ill today...great! I just finished watching Brief Encounter, which made me cry-again. I have a great affinity with the whole play/film/legend that it is. One day maybe i will play in it again-but it was good to watch. Personally i dont like it as much as the play, partly because in the play Stanley has a bigger part! But also because in the play there is much more focus on Myrtle and Albert's relationship. Anyway, it makes me very neurotic.

The Americans woke up! We spent the day together on saturday, and Clare has grown up lots! She looks just like Britney Spears which is scary. In fact, she is scary. She keeps threatening to jump on me in the night. I got my revenge by hiding a hairbrush in her sheets. hehehehe.

I had a great idea over the weekend! I bombarded many ""visit"" so and so sites of european countries-and i have ordered all of the brochures! I will be reviewing them and then narrow the list down. I was annoyed at the Monaco site-they only send info packs to fat americans. grr.

I am today composing my english coursework speech about homophobia. It is very good! Yet some quotes i found on the internet were quite upsetting-even made me doubt myself. I was just reading about the Laramie Project, my friend was in a production of it.

It dawned on me how uncultured i am. I dont really have a ""pigeon"". Nothing that i really am brilliant, or very knowledgable about. Which makes me feel boring and direction-less. Sure i listen to ""classic"" music, and watch some old films, tinker about on a computer, admire art-but i only ever scratch the surface-never do i venture into the depths of anything. And talking politics with me would be almost useless. People at school always tell me how ""intelligent"" i am etc, but im not! I just know a few things, not paricularly a great speciality. I doubt i'll find one. Maybe if i find some thick people to befriend, then i will be more intelligent! Nick is v. clever. 

I'm meeting him, incidentally, in two weeks time. Afterwards, i promise myself now, i will never meet anyone again from the internet. It just, is so.... cliche?no, twee. And it makes me feel, somehow, common. I just have ideals-and none of them have been fulfilled as of yet. Maybe i WILL become a monk. The more i think about it, the more appealing it becomes. It is stupid-i suppose. But, a life without love-how hard can it be? Most of the time ""love"" is overrated-and misused as an emotion. I dont believe in love-it is, again, cliched. I await love though-maybe i just havent expeienced it yet. Is that too contradictory? See-i'm like that. What a fool i am. Anyway, i will try and release myself from this funk.

And, as a footnote-i need more people to read this! I need friends!!

Such a poignant song, i think. Whenever i listen to it, i am reminded of Abbey. Although, of course we can't be together, i still manage to miss her. My soulmate, i think, The one true person i think is...well, me. Me in girls form. Golly, i guess i do love her. But not ""love"", more an emotional binding. After all, i'm gay and she is a girl! 

I was woken up far far far too early. I can never get back to sleep-that is why i am almost falling alseep now. The day of my mother's big party has dawned, and with it a sense of jubilation/stress. (pronounced as ""streeeessh""-with a heavy bavarian accent). The weather has been behaving so oddly today. Rain AND shine. Best of both i say, poxy weather says my sister.

I was in tears last night-i have no idea why. Well, i do. I was just thinking about everything my life has led me into. everything, the good and the bad in a bitter-sweet recollection that reduced me to tears. The weather, the music on the radio (midnight train to Georgia by Gladys Knight)it was just so remeniscent of my childhood. Days when i was innocent and so naive, naivety was bliss. I do get certain days, or even just moments like that, melancholies when i realise all these things have happened, and will never happen again. I am thankful for my memory. 

Thank goodness i have that off my chest! Lewis rang me last night. To tell me all about his ""new man"". urgh.

On wednesday, that was yesterday (in case anyone ahd forgotten) i went to meet lewis. The train got to maidstone on time. Incidentally, i was rather apprehensive about venturing to the county capital of kent, but it was rather nice! Anna and Lara where v late turning up, so i was standing there ll on my tod waiting for them. Trust Lewis to turn up early, so i ahd a thirty second pep talk off Anna and the i was thrust into it. He is very good looking, and at first i was rather taken. We walked down a very busy road full of builders making a noise and conversation was not very ""fluide"" as the french would say. As sson as we sat down in cafe nero, though, it all changed! We couldn't stop talking. Most of the time i babbled like a fish, but he laughed lots! After we had consumed the very last dregs of our overpriced hot chocolate, we sat and talked for a while longer, before heading off. He took me to a gorgeous park in maidstone, with a big lake, The sun was shing and we walked hand in hand and went and sat under a tree, where we kissed. Ah! We agreed we were going out, and the rest, as they say, is history!

Later on i got the train back with Lara and Anna to kemsing-the middle of nowhere. We decided to walk to my house the scenic way through fields-what a mistake. We went the wrong way, and so got stuck on the wrong side of the stream. We ahd to walk a detour and then through a cabbage field. I amnaged to get over a bit of fence that was broken, which involved elaping of the ditch which stood between me and the field. Anna and Lara both fell over when told to jump. Honestly. It was very funny, but by the end we were all covered in nettle stings, all sneezing form hayfever and late for my upcoming B-B-Q. Thank god my mother was on call to rescue us.

We arrived back home and had a fantastic barbecue, everyone enjoying themselves and being happy and then a walk around kemsing! As we walked past the pub we saw lots of morris dancers!What a jolly. Then a car full of boy racers kept driving past a bibbing at us. Hmm-its on becaus eof Claire and her great personalities..hehe.

I made myself breakfast ( 2 rashers of grilled bacon, an egg, buttered toast and a small cup of rather strong espresso) i sat down and read a chapter of my book. I did some more washing and the comennced work on my room. After a bit more washing, and having pegged afore mentioned washing on the line, i made myself lunch. I ahd a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich and a doughnut to finish. 

I went upstairs and cried a bit more. 

I think keeping myself occupied helped, but god knows why i am so emotional at the moment. I think maybe it is because i am tired, but i just seem to be a human water spout. As soon as i start talking about him i get a lump in my throat, and it feels like someone has dropped a stone in my stomach.

I am determined to go on wednesday and meet him. Out of curiosity, i suppose. My dear Anna, in all her wisdom said ""do whatever is prevalent""-and my curiosity is outweighing my doubt. More like dread....

Anyway-after texting him twice today i doubt he wants to know me anymore. Who thought it would all end like this? My every chance at love is failing, and with it my hope of ever finding gratification of being loved.

Until then, i'll dream of my prince. He will visit me in my dreams and then i can be happy. In those fleeting hours of the night i can have my midnight romance, a love most resilient and desirable.

I got back home and signed in to msn, and talked to Lewis. He tells me he is worried that when we meet he ""wont find me attractive"". That struck a sore chord and i just flipped. He had to go and then i just cried and cried. I talked briefly to sarah which didnt help, and the stopped crying and went outside. I helped my sister lasso a tree and then my eyes began watering again and she made me tell her what was wrong. I love my sister sometimes. She said ""andrew, you are a beautiful perosn. Maybe you dont have the best looks, but you have a wonderful personality."" I went up to my room and then cried a bit more. Anna rang and then i went and curled up in my mum's bed and cried on the phone to her. We had a talk and then a general bitch about some people, who shall remain nameless (alex, cough, vicky). She then told me not to worry about Lewis, basically that he would be a fool not to see what he was missing. They are all good at cheering me up, but i just keep feeling this sinking feeling.

Hannah stormed out of the house and i followed promptly, to be met by Victoria. We exchanged pleasentries and then talked about her ex boyfriend (who, incidentally is urning out to be more and more child like everyday)this continued until her minibus arrived to whisk her off to private school.

I ahd English first, to kill a mockingbird is such a good book-i recommend it. We sat there and coloured in our maps of Alabama and occasionally chuckled at mrs bullock when she did her squat. Ah!I love sitting next to Anna in english!

Next we had German and our oral tests. I was quite nervous about these, but i got an A*-so all is well. I got a very nice text from Lewis and Anna said ""awwwwwww-hes so nice"" we then ranted about ex boyfriends, especially Ben. Anna is writing him hate mail at the moment-muahahahahaha.

Then i was walking to science and random people decided to shout things at me which made me sad. I talked to Amy and she cheered me up. We talked about Lewis and boyfriends and random things. Everyone seems so happy for me-ahhh!

I got in and now im writing this, before i indulge in dinner, and then hopefully talk to L because his evil sister is on the computer.....grrrrrrr.

talk later

<P>hello! I'm tired, surprise surprise. I was up till very late talking to Lewis the sehr sehr fit. We talk about nothing really, but talking crap is so much fun! Well, i went to sleep really late and then i woke up! Wow- what an eventful evening.</P>
<P>I went to school. This entailed going to the bus stop really early and standing there like a lemon until the bus driver decided to arrive. I was angry by this point, as i had missed a good half hour of radio 1. We arrived at school and then the usual...maths (fun fun averages!) then german. Then the fun really started, modular science exams! I actually found them quite easy, the physics especially. Very scary. Because of our stupid science teachers, the canteen half that year 10s go into was closed, we had to use the year seven side, then there was no pasta left. I had to settle for bland macaroni cheese, so i had extra cheese. The stupid frumpy face-like-a-dogs-whatsit canteen lady charged me extra. And then i didnt even eat it all!! My anger was quite immeasurable.</P>
<P>Me and Anna traversed back to the form room, where we were faced with a scene of utter destruction. The oh-so-mature boys in our class had been revelling in throwing the remnants of used to look like lunch alll around the place. We decided to wait outside whilst they threw oranges at ben thomas. UGH! Such juvenile pratts.</P>
<P>Also, on monday, Amy Bartlett told me i am on Mr. Sparke's special list! What jolly good fun i said! We're all being invited to Oxford. Watch this space!</P>
<P>Also-anna shares my pain-charlotte-the lovely french conversation assistant left today!we love Charlotte!</P>
<P>Anyway...now i'm just sitting here waiting for mr gorgy to arrive!!</P>
<P>talk later</P>

<P>Well!!I havent written in you for an age. I apologise for that-all of 22 days!I had exams...and homework.</P>
<P>I feel i have failed my exams, despite my revision efforts. Whatever i do goes wrong!Talking of wrong...me and Andy didnt work out. I miss him slightly. Althoiugh now i ahve a new guy, his name is Lewis and hes 16. Anna loves him and sarah is intrigued-i only realised to day how much i miss and love my square bear. If she wasnt so wrapped up in church friends. Somehow she has changed-but we still love her. He is very nice, but im somehow worried about getting in too deep with him. Last time i got so hurt with the whole Ben thing, I got in far too deep, luckily anna was there to receive my endless phone calls of lament, but still. Im sure we'll see how it pans out. I just hope he really is as good as he seems. Maybe at last ive found a stable relationship.</P>
<P>Anyway!i have modules tomorrow-and i must revise!And they put my otehr cat down too-poor mungo, he was 15.,</P>
<P>talk later</P>

"event","Well, as in most days, i awoke in my bedroom with a nice view of my ceiling! I got up and looked out of the window, and the weather was depressing.

I went downstairs and pottered, without eating breakfast and then went to sevenoaks with maman. I bought the pattern for the skirt i have to make in textiles. Im sure hannah will look fantastic when she wears it.

Right now im feeling slightly miffed because my friend anna is going to the cinema with lara-and i wasnt invited. I resent that.Grrrrr.

Im also blooooooooo!!because andy isnt online, he is at a birthday party, and won't be back till v late. I will wait up to talk to him. I think im getting too attached. Its the nice weather we're having at 8 o'clock in the evening!And mel torme crooning mildly about blue moon...ah. I think i have fallen for him big time.

Everyone is really annoyed at the age difference-i dont see it as that much of a problem. 

I miss my cat-poor creature. I hope she is happy where she is.

I am going to eat soon. I hope!!More burnt offerings....

And i have work tomorrow!I hate it i hate it i hate it!!!!!!!!!"

I forgot my headset so i was forced to listen to KMFM. Ugh!!!I ahd to sprint down the drive because it was raining and i didnt ahve an umbrella, and when i finally got into school, everyone was depressed!its annoying.

We had to run the 800meters in pe to, ARGH!!!in the rain!!It was awful!!i was nearly dying-it was the fact we ahd 3 extra laps too. Poor me!

"event","Actually, no event. I went to school-and i got an A* on my biolgy module, which is odd, because science isnt ""my thing"" and biolgy is my worst science. Iwas amazed by the little heat spot on the page. Tres cool.

Angry at Sarah because she told karen that we are boring, i was not amused and wreaked my rewenge (hahaha) when mrs bullock was rambling on about teaching. ""can you light a fire""-yes, can you? What a crappy slogan, i mean, really. I was also astounded in chemistry as we have no more miss robinson!!I shall miss the old trout. Dr Wilkin was trying to be sensitive about her getting the sack. ""miss robinson and i decided she had tken you as far as you could go."" HA!!Thats what she thinks.Sorry-its the emma golley ""i hate miss robinson mood"". Whoops. Anyway!Hello everybody-im sure i wont be very commited to this diary but i shall try. 'onest guv!

Good day,

"event","Look, i'm updating. I figured i would since i never do. Heh. I wonder who will notice?

So a day in the life of Mayya. I'm still with Brent (surprise surprise). He is SOOOOOOOOOOOO wonderful to me. I wants me to finish up with school as soon as i can, but not rush through it. It's better to take another step in your relationship with less stres (NO, WE'RE NOT ENGAGED/GONNA GET ENGAGED/GETTING MARRIED, BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!).

Um...amit. He's like Big from Sex and the City. Just pops in and out of my life as he pleases. He put my new rims on my car a month ago and i told him i'd pay him back with ice cream. Finally on friday, i reached him and he got his ice cream. Him and i sat around for about an hour and talked. Then we texted. Then i went out with my ubber wonderful boyfriend. I got home and went to bed around 1:30 or so. Around 1:50 i get a phone call from non other than the drunk amit professing his love to me, admitting that he played dumb to a lot of things that happened and he remembers nearly everything, that his girlfriend annoys him, but it's a routine that he can't get out of that he always dreams/thinks about ""us"" and what it would be like if him and i never broke up and how much fun he had with me and blah de fuckin blah. My response? ""Amit, you had me. You lost me. And now i'm over you.""

Oh, rich dropped off the face of this earth. OMG, as soon as i typed that, he called me. BWAHAHAHA! Loren went to the army and the only way i can keep in contact with him is through snail mail. O_O Dave....stopped talking to me. Craig is a really good friend of mine and the rumor is is that he wants me balls (figurativly speaking, of course). Uh....who am i leaving out? Oh yeah, Amit's girlfriend, Hilary.

Well, i TRIED to be her friend. That didn't work. I TRIED to be her acquiantence, that didn't work, either. I tried to just ignore her. HA! That didn't work. The bitch won't stop harassing me. Texts me off Amit's phone pretending to be him. Gets on xanga and harasses me on there. Texts me off her OWN phone threatening to beat me up. WTF?! I've told amit to tell her to leave me alone. I've told mutual friends to tel lher to leave me alone. Her numerous times to leave me alone in numerous ways. The bitch is going down. ^_^

Am i leaving anyone out now?

I put my head on his shoulder the other day and it fit. it was perfect. :D
On thursday night we attempted to watch a movie...twice...but ended up talking the entire time!!! ANyways, he went to st. louis to a car show so this weekend i was moping around. Apparently when we went camping, people were asking rich was was wrong with me. haha. I didn't know i was THAT noticable. But yeah. Camping was hella fun. And then on saturday night i hung out with becky and gennie and we finaly found and bought shirts and stencil thingies for our shirts. Now, we just have to find a day to make 'em. HAHA. It's gonna be UBBER fun!!!

Then we hung uot with Brandon and Rusty and ended the night at 4 am with them. But um...when we were all parting from perkins, Brandon and i hugged and he kissed me on the head...

i like brandon so much...but like i told him, i don't think it's our time yet...."

And then when we were making out (sorry for the details), his ""weak spot"" is the same as amit's. FREAKIN AYE! I'm so scared now. I think i'm starting to fall for him...."

"event","ok, so i have a problem...guys (go figure).
Ok, on one hand, there's Brandon. He's from paola so he only comes up here on the weekeneds. He likes me A LOT! He's a really sweet guy and down to earth so kinda...my opposite. Him and i kissed...but i didn't feel any sparks.

Ok, on the other hand, there's Brent....
I've always thought he was cute and when i first SAW him (not met) back in sept (yes, that long ago). Then him and his girl broke up, but i was kinda sorta friends with her. I don't talk to her anymore. But yeah, him and i hung out in my car for about 3 hours (we went to get my tent from my lake house). Talked about EVERYTHING! It was great. Then, we came back around 1 (left at 10:30). No one was out and he decided he wanted to eat so i rode with him to McDonalds. Then we went to kicks 'cuz a few people were there. Then drove around. Then back to his place and we watched a movie. We were ok for a bit and then he started making fun of me (towards the end) so i poked him and he jumped so he put his hand over to my other side and started tickeling me. And then he just held me and we held hands and it was so wonderful. And then i started feeling the feelings that i had when i first hung out with amit....And now i dunno. I think i like him. 

Now, if i really DO like him, what am i gonna do with Brandon?"

yeah, the other night, some girls went driving past and amit was on his bike so he started flashing his brights at the them and honking his horn and then he went off chasing after them, but that chase was cut short when he fell off his bike. Good thing he wasn't going to fast. He just flew off his bike and his bike got beat up. Sad, he now has no car. He has no bike. His ""gf"" is sick (but he's still chasing after other girls). His ""friends"" are just nice to his face. La de da. When is he gonna realize he pretty much has nothing when he used to have everything?"

- relationship of convenience
- megan
- faye
- jack ass/nice

<b>***UPDATE***</b>
So, i'm pretty much over amit. Yeah, he screwed me over big time even though he sat there to my face telling me how badly he's been screwed over in the past. So, Hilary and him are ALWAYS all over each other...when i'm there. HAHA. But when i'm not there, they aren't even NEXT to each other. Odd, eh? My friends all told me that second i pull up, they get all over each other. Oh, and last night, i was out and for once they weren't all over each other! They were SOOOOO far away from each other. HAHA, i also found out that Amit is messing around with someone named megan and Hilary doesn't really think the relationship is gonna last therefore making it a <b>realtionship of convenience</b>. *cackle*
On top of that, him and Faye were gonna hook up or something. Like, she was asking him when he was gonna give her a ride on his bike and he asked what she was doing the next day and then hilary came up and they stopped talking....HAHAHA.

Oh, also, he's suck a fuckin jackass to me, unless he's drunk 'cuz then he's soooo nice to me. Fucker. I just completley ignore him."

I'm now thinking back to the past 2 months where you would send me into circles of confusion. One day you would tell me so much and still kiss me and then the next you wouldn't even speak to me. We saw 3 movies in one week. We laughed and flirted and huged. The next, you were with someone else, lying to me. How am i supposed to act? I'm not sorry for being a bitch to you. If anything, you deserve the attitude i hold towards you. YOU want the hating to stop? Shouldn't've started it in the beginning. Of all the people you were ever around, i think i'm the one who stuck around with hope that maybe something would work out. What a lie! Nothing came out and look where i am now. Over you.</i>"

And i saw him last night with *gag* her. He was kinda distant from her. She always wanted to put her head on his shoulder or something, and he'd let her for about 30 seconds and then he'd walk off or do something on his bike or something.  *shrug* i dunno, just an observation....*cackles inside*"

i cried there. 
i cried on my way home 'cuz i didn't feel comfortable being there (i even told him that). 
i cried in bed. i cried every hour that i woke up 'cuz that image kept waking me up...i'm so emotionally drained that i keep crying...i need to stop."

"event","well, it all seems like a fuckin MOVIE...and wait, it's not.

He never was with stefanie. She's just a stupid high school girl who *thought* they were together who told Rich and Rich told me and blah de blah....more drama. Apparently, i was starring her down last night when she came up to 24. Oops. HAHAHA! I hate that bitch, anyways. Well, i found out why Amit broke up with me. He...fell....in love with me. And the last time he fell in love with someone, he was with them for 2 years, and then she broke his heart. And he was scared that i was going to do the same thing.

So last night, i took him to the side, and asked him why he thought *I* was going to hurt him. He said he was afraid 'cuz of what happened to him in the past. I told him to let go of the past. I told him he had to give me a chance. I started crying and he almost did to. He told me after what happened to him in the past, he didn't want to give his heart away. So, when he realized he was falling in love with me, he pushed me away. He said he was scared to give up his heart. I think i started crying at that point, but i tried SOOO hard to hold my tears back.

Isn't it wierd how i'm *still* not giving up? But hey, at least i finally got to the bottom of it all.

I have applied Newton's 2nd Law: for every action, there is an equal, but opposite, reaction.

Each time he tried to push me away, i pushed right back."

ANYWAYS....i've decided i dont' know if i regret the kiss. part of me, yes. part of me, no. I've decided that although i don't do revenge, i may have to make an exception and then go to synagogue (sp?) and pray my ass off. lol. ANYWAYS...i think i'm staying in tonight and going to bed early. I need to think...what the hell have i gotten myself into? I'm done with rich. I sent him a text telling him i hate him (yea yeah, it's not gonna do much. bite me!). Oh, last night, i woke my parents up 'cuz i started sobbing (what? mayya cries?!) like no other. They ended up taking my phone and telling me to go to bed. I'm glad they took my phone or else i'd probably be up all night and pull what amit did...be up for 48 hours. i don't believe ANYTHING he says. My wrist kills which is a sign for me to go. peace out. If/when i find out the truth, i dunno if i'm gonna share or not. Probably yes 'cuz it'll help me get it off my mind...kinda. It took me forever and a day to fall asleep, last night.

Yeah...And amit said a lot of shit and HE kissed me and he was even like ""now i'm initiating it"" and EVERYONE was starring, probably. At one point, i saw steven looking over at us...and...AHHH!! And Amit kept saying how he made a mistake and he kept saying it over and over and how he spent 3 hours just laying around thinking about it and just kept repeating the mistake thing and i was like ""this mistake can be fixed"" and he kept on saying how it would be weird and i kept asking him how and then finally he looked at me and said ""i don't know"" and i asked him if he was gonna remember all of this tomorrow and he said probably so we'll see. I'll probably see him out tonight...or if he decides to call me...oy. Rich was really happy for me...Maybe rich isn't as darshey was i thought he was. He came up to me and was like ""give me a hug. nadja called."" HEHE. Anyways, i have my appointed for my wrist tomorrow so that should be exciting...But yeah. I hope everything goes well...Oh, so they all decided to go to steak and shake, but i cuoldn't go 'cuz i had class at 8 and it was already 12:50 so i was telling amit i couldn't and he was like ""yeah you can. yeah you can"" and finally i came up to his car and told him that he had to get down on one knee and hold a rose in his mouth and apologize and he was like ""whatever it takes"" and i kissed him on the nose and then we all drove off."

Anyways, i ended up talking to josh about amit and amit DOES remember making out. And Josh asked me if i still liked him and i was like ""dear god, yes!"" and he was like ""i'll talk to him"" and i'm like ""no! i don't like people getting into my stuff"" and he's like ""no, i'll talk to him from me, not from you"" and then he told me that rich is apparently going around telling people that i texted messaged him asking him to a dinner and movie...uh...NO! How many times do i have to nail it into his stupid head that i'm not interested in him. I was about to go back and slap the shit out of him. Uh...tomorrow night!! ANYWAYS...i left and now i'm about to go to bed. NIGHT!! I <3 everyone, even though the majority of people don't read this and i kinda like it that way. :)"

"event","Hmm...so what has happened since the amit kiss? Well, he was hella drunk so he definatly didn't remember the kiss, although i highly doubt that. ANYWAYS...i talked to him last night about some stupid stephanie girl who is going around telling people him and her are dating. He was like ""i dun like drama"" blah blah blah and now i'm thinking ""quit hanging out with her and your drama will end."" Oh, a few nights ago, i had my wrist wrapped and stephanie was up there and i had to leave to get water so rich came up to her and was like ""you know why her wrist is wrapped?"" and she's like ""why?"" and he's like ""'cuz she beat up the last girl that tried to get on amit."" and apparently stephanie was then in a rush to go home. HAHAHA! Oh, and last night, when i pulled up, i saw her pulling away. Me, evil? what?! NO!!! HAHAHA. Anyways, i'm gonna start my recovery/getting over thing, even thought it will be HELLA hard. Loren (a guy) invited me to dinner next weekend so i'm excited for that. He's a really sweet guy and we're just going as friends. HAHA. I can't wait to see Amit's face when he sees me and loren pull up...I'm supposed to show Jason how i'm gonna find out his kissing technique. What? I'm not a hoe!! HAHAHA!!! Oh, apparently rich is now going around telling people that i'm his GIRLFRIEND! WHAT THE FUCKIN FUCK?!
What else happened? Oh, last night, i had 3 mike's hard lemonade, and a captain and coke so i was kinda gooone. But it was fun 'cuz dave and i were the only drunk ones and it was funny 'cuz everyone was harassing me. HAHA. Flat coke what? I can't wait to see my posse when they all get in town!! I <3 you all!! I dont' think i'm gonna want a boyfriend until after finals. K. I am not on the prawl. Oh, and when he's ready and he wants to come back to me, he'll have to do it on his own. i'm done initiating shit. What happened to his shyness?"

"event","ok, what happened was that jason cave me a bottle of RASPBERRY mike's hard lemonade (btw, it is SOOOOOOO freakin good!!) and i was sharing it with kim. I dun think it had much of an influence (ok..maybe a little) 'cuz i didn't even buzz or anything, although i haven't been latley. ANYWAYS...we were all up at steak and shake and i was just being loud and obnoxious, but i didn't mind 'cuz i knew who i was being loud and obnoxious around. So then the parentals call and of course i don't pick up, but i have to leave. I see amit and his buddy drinking in his car and i came up there and scared the living shiat out of amit. It smelled like a brewery in his car...anyways...i made him give me and hug and then i just...kissed him. Yes, me again. That's what happened the first time, too. Anyways, i started walking off and he was like ""wait..."" and i was like ""what?"" and he's like ""i wasn't done!"" and then i started giving him a hard time about ignoring me and breaking up with me and blah de blah and then his friend was like ""just do it"" and him and i started making out. haha. and his friend grabbed MY hand and put it around amit's head. HAHAHA! But yeah. Then his friend was like ""give me a hug"" and i go ""ok, but i won't kiss you"" haha. i feel bad for saying that, but i know he has a gf. ANYWAYS...then amit was like ""you should call me"" and i give him a sly, flirty look and i go ""if you want to talk to me, YOU'LL call me"" and then i said bye and ran off and talked kim down. Her bf is being a dick wad to her. ANYWAYS....uh...i'll post later tonight if he calls me or not."

"event","Weee, i downloaded me one of those thingies you can have on your comp to update LJ so yeah. This'll be easier to do rather than opening IE (i'm lazy). Anyways...Rich just texted me telling me the only reason he's coming out tonight is to see me...uh...i told him last night that i could only like him as a friend 'cuz my heart is somewhere else...OWWW...my back is killing me and my wrist is throbbing. Anyways...i dunno what to do with rich. Oh, on top of that, all the guys i hang out with (basically, i'm the only girl who hangs out with the guys in the group) are all TOOOOO friendly. Eric is hilarious. I need to get a cable to upload my pics from my phone 'cuz they're damn funny. Anyways...i had fun last night chillin with the guys. I don't want to lead any of 'em  on. I don't want to tease any of 'em on. Oy!!!

"event","yeah, him and i broke up and now his friends are all hitting on me. go figure. yeah, one of 'em even texted me to tell me he likes me...uh...my heart is still with him. *le sigh* and apparently he still likes me...wtf? Apparently i'm the prettiest and coolest girl he's ever dated (based on what his friends say). Rich even told me that i'm the coolest girl he's ever met...WTF? If i'm all that and all his friends think i'm awesome, why is HE afraid to be with me? He KNOWS i'm madly head over heels for him. For pete's sake, we spent a fuckin MONTH trying to chase after each other and another 2 weeks trying to get each others numbers!!! It's really wierd though 'cuz his friends would call me to tell me where they're at and he'll be there, too, but i didn't call HIM. I dunno how to explain it. Yep, i barley EVER update the LJ. I like xanga better so check me out there. LJ is used for stuff when i need opinions, but not for certain people to see. So in that case......i need opinions!!"

"event","The only reason i'm writing in my LJ is so that a friend of mine will not see it 'cuz i need some major advice!!! So my really good from since 3rd grade has wanted to room with me for the longest time. I was cool with it in the beginning. Then, at the beginning of the semester, things got nasty, but she didn't change. She is too dependent on me and that's what would happen if her and i roomed. She would also cause a lot of drama and stress and i just don't...wait scratch that...I HATE to deal with it. Her and i have roomed before for, like, BBYO conventions and i'm surprised both of us came out alive. So, i found a spiffy place for the next 2 school years and i'm probably gonna be moving there so...how do i break it to her? Keep in mind: MAJOR DRAMA QUEEN!!! So it's like whoever you may know to be a drama queen.....TIME TEN!!!
HELP ME, MY FELLOW PEOPLE, HELP ME!!!"

"event","Things in life that piss me off is one someone you care about decides that they were going to drink one night and not wait for me to even be there. And then tell me to take there friends home because someone decided to drink. Should I not be upset about this. Yes I told this person that I would stay the night and I decided otherwise because I didn't want to stay up and argue all night that I would go home especially since I got back later than I thought, also I was tired, and upset that the other person didn't take care of there responsibilities before the decide to get wild. Should I be bothered by this? I need feedback on this one. Someone please write me back and tell me I'm not crazy."

"event","There is no such thing as a true friend. You always have to keep your guard no matter who is around. My trip to South Carolina sucked. Let's see my clutch blew out on the way down there, and then I had to rent a car to go the rest of the way. I got rear ended after leaving the rental agency. I get home five days later to find out that the clutch they put in my car is the wrong one, so my car get's to sit at another dealership for a week the finally put that right one in and then say I have a coolant leak. FU you blood suckin' bastards. My car is still not done. I'm very angry. I wish I could find love as easily as other people and be able to let them in on my deepest secrets. I doubt that will, I'm not being pessimistic, just being real. It hurts to love anyway at least if your alone then your heart is safe."

I may have to move out of my fathers house. I don't know what to do. Life is really sucking right now. I need people to talk to and have no one because the usual answer is that "" I'm busy, or I have bad signal, or Let me call you back."" I never get the call back and I am getting upset. I am not sure what to do. I need help. I cant ask my father because he has been getting on my case a lot lately. It's driving me nuts."

Find me here where I lay.
All I do is cry and cry.
I know the reason why.
For not knowing loves true touch.
That means so very much.
Some one shoot me.
I can live life empty.
I need help but are you there.
No your gone to a far away place.
From your life which makes me erased.
Hope to see you sometime soon.
But I die before high noon."

"event","Life is crazy. I have so many thoughts spinning throughout my cranium. I just don't undestand why things are the way they are and why I am powerless to change it. I am just getting more depressed as of late and I don't know what to do. I just want things to be alright but they never are. I always have to fight an uphill battle no matter where I go. Whether it be with work, trying to keep the friends I have or just being able to see my son. It's like everyone is trying to tell me to just sit back and let things happen. But I just cant do that. I wont do that. But my spirit and fire in the fight are waining. I'm afraid I might do something rash and give everyone a solid reason to dislike me. I am having a hard time and the easiest way to express that is through my journal. I want to be loved, but it's like I'm not allowed to be. Otherwise why would my last three girlfriends cheat on me. I barely get to see my son and it seems like he doesn't even recognize me. I rarely get to see my father because I work so much. I cant quit my job because I am saving for my sons future the kind I didn't have a forecast for. I am angry, I am sad. I am a volcano on the verge of erupting and I don't know how to stop it from happening. I guess I will release one of these days and then everyone will be happy because I will be out of the picture. Sometime I think it would be better if I just wasn't around."

"event","I found out today that one of my friends family doesn't like me because of my actions in the past. This is a deep blow to me. This stuff happened years ago. I am completely different now. I am so depressed at hearing this news. Because my friend is one of the most important people in my life and I cant hang out with her because something happened 10 years ago. So now I cry and cry. But what can you do. Just when I start to reconnect with people it comes to end because my past gets brought up and the apocalypse happpens. Now I know I will probably never get to see her except chance encounters which will be brief. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I should pack up and move and start a new life where people don't know anything about me. I don't know what to do. I need help. I'm scared. Somebody please help me. This pain has got to stop."

"event","I cried again and I don't know why. The nightmares are coming back. I fear that my inner demons may slay me. What should I do? Cant call anyone they are all asleep. They don't need to be bothered with my problems, anyway. They have enough on their plates. What should I do? Ho hum. I work at night and sleep during the day. I feel like a damn vampire. Not sure what to do anymore. I'm scared to tell certain people how I feel for fear of rejection or making things awkward. Things I cant handle to well. Life is a curious bastard throwing you through one loop and into another. Always changing. An invariable equation that will never be slated. Only I have the power in my own life. Whether to take it or let it stay. I will stay for sure. I cant leave, I seem to be good at fucking up peoples lives. Maybe I'll leave my phone off today and at least that way everyone will have some peace for a change. Because no matter how hard I try things never work out the way I would hope them to. Oh well. Later People!"

"event","Hello everyone,
I am happy to be apart of this service. I am not picky so if you like what I write then write me back. I only know one person on this service and wanted to say hi stars_of_heaven. Today is another day at work with the tidious overtures of acting like a machine for 12 and half hours a day. Oh joy. I am a Laser Programer/Operator in Michigan. I have a wonderful little boy who is the most precious thing in my life I would die for him. My ex(his mother) on the other hand is not to pleasant. But hey you take lifes bumps and bruises and learn from them. I am a person who will always listen to anyones problem, but I wont give advice unless you ask for it. I am honest, hardworking, loyal, truthful, and upbeat. Everyone have a wonderful day. Catch ya'll on the flip side."

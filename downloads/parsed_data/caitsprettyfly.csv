"event","So all I think about lately is my grandparents.&nbsp; It's pretty much on my mind 24/7 and I cry at the most random times.&nbsp; I try so hard to keep myself together but I just can't do it.&nbsp; It's like... nothing else matters.&nbsp; I'm always worried about my mom and how she's dealing with it because I know if I'm taking it this badly, she's gotta be eight million times worse.&nbsp; Their deaths were so premature.&nbsp; They should still be alive.&nbsp; I'm graduating in less than a month, and they won't be there to see it.&nbsp; They won't be able to see me go through college and get married or anything.&nbsp; They didn't get to see any of my life.&nbsp; My grandfather would be so proud that I'm graduating high school and going to college and my grandmother can't yell at me for my big boobs anymore.&nbsp; I can just see her in my mind hugging me, pulling away a little and saying ""you wear tight shirts around me to make me jealous!"" and laughing&nbsp; and pulling me back in like she did every time I saw her.&nbsp; I can picture my grandfather sitting in the chair next to the bar at their house and saying ""Heeeey kiddo hows tennis?&nbsp; You play like Martina Navritalova yet?""&nbsp; I can picture him at Christmas, taking like ten years to hand out the presents and at Thanksgiving taken ten years to say grace before the meal.&nbsp; I can picture my grandmother in her kitchen dancing to Tom Jones and sitting at her bar with curlers in her hair.&nbsp; I just regret so much that I didn't spend more time with them and that they didnt know me better and that I complained when I had to go visit them because now that they're gone, it's so hard to think that I can never talk to them again.&nbsp; I mean... they were like the best people in the whole world and they were so funny, they always made fun of each other and argued but you know they werent being serious and that they really loved each other.&nbsp; And it hurt so much to see them suffer.&nbsp; Grandpop was in so much pain, he wasn't even himself anymore.&nbsp; I hated seeing that, he was always so healthy and active.&nbsp; And grandmom spent her whole life with him, and she didnt know how to be without him so once he left, she didnt have a chance.&nbsp; She couldnt live any longer without him by her side, there's no way.&nbsp; She was so sad and all the life drained out of her once he died.&nbsp; My mom told me that my grandmom called her one day and she went into their house and grandmom was just sitting on her couch with grandpop's urn in her lap, crying.&nbsp; Thinking of her in pain like that just kills me.&nbsp; I remember the day of his viewing, she walked into the funeral parlor like she was walking to her own death.&nbsp; She was so scared.&nbsp; She wanted a minute alone with him, so we all waited in the lounge.&nbsp; When we went in, she was leaning over his casket crying.&nbsp; I never saw her cry before that day.&nbsp; I remember at their 50th anniversary party, she was prancing around to everyone so happy and dancing and singing.&nbsp; And then at his wake, she walked around to say hi to everybody again, but she wasnt happy, she wasnt dancing.&nbsp; She was scared and sick and sad and it was so hard to watch.&nbsp; I stayed with her two nights before she died and she seemed to be doing better.&nbsp; I woke up the morning before she died, and she had walked up the stairs, and she hadnt done that in months.&nbsp; She seemed to really be doing well, she was making plans and wanting to make her house look nice, she had just bought a new chair and had my uncle hang pictures.&nbsp; But then I got a call the next day from my mom.&nbsp; She said ""Grandmom died this morning.""&nbsp; I couldnt believe it.&nbsp; I mean, how could that have happened?&nbsp; She was improving, she seemed happier.&nbsp; I mean, of course she never would have been truly happy but she was dealing with it.&nbsp; But then she died just like that.&nbsp; I didnt see it coming.&nbsp; I had no closure with them.&nbsp; It's mother's day today.&nbsp; A month ago, I found a mother's day card that I thought she would like, so I bought it.&nbsp; And now she'll never get it.&nbsp; On Easter, we had to buy a card just for grandmom, not a card that said ""grandparents.""&nbsp; It's the little things that really get to you when something like this happens.&nbsp; I dont think anybody understands, and I know people are sick of me talking about it, but I can't help it.&nbsp; I'm so depressed, I can barely function anymore.&nbsp; So far, 2007 is really sucking.&nbsp; I just want them to come back.&nbsp; I would do absolutely anything if they could.&nbsp; I miss them so much and I really cant believe Ill never see them again.&nbsp; It's just too much to handle."

"event","it's awful, love. even when its the good love and you've loved back, it still hurts. when ever i'm not with him, when ever he's with anyone else, whenever he's sad or paranoid or angry, it hurts worse than bad love. but when we are together and happy, it feels so right, we fit perfectly with each other. we can just smile and talk and touch for hours and sometimes it feels like seconds, that will last forever. and sometimes it even feels so good that it hurts when you're together because it's more perfect than anything and you feel like crying and don't know why. it feels like no one else is as in love, or will be ever, and no one else should matter.

ok ok so somethings have been bothering me for a few days now.. my boyfriend started talking about one of his close friends that happens to be female and all this time he spent with her and etc. i get jelous of course. but thats nothing new. and then he says that she wants to meet me.. get to know me.. you know.. so i know he wouldnt cheat on me with her.. that came off a little akward.. maybe he didnt mean that the way it was said.. but then he says.. i think you two would like each other-- *your like the same person*...... that brings me down on so many levels.. (i mean no offence to the girl-- i dont know her and im sure shes pretty neat -- what im feeling has nothing to do with her personally) 1. im exactly like someone else.. 2. hes in love with me and im exactly like her, yet hes not in love with her.. ? 3. well.. lets stop there.. dont want to get too deep.. but my point is.. yeah theres no point.. it was just upseting me. i mean i know hes not cheating on me.. i just needed to get that out... 

Anthony has been talking shit about me.. he thinks im a slut apparently.. do I come off as slutty? please let me know.

I hate being alone.. I was in Florida alone constantly.. i hated it.. i was left with my thoughts for too long and when that happens i get scared and paranoid.. god i was so paranoid about everything. i had 2 or 3 panic attacks within 6 days.. eep.

Rex pisses me off .. he forces himself apon me he hits me he throws stuff at me he calls me terrible things hits on me and i still forgive him for ruining me... 
Im stupid... hes stupid... thank god i never see him.. Id kill myself..

whew.. well Im off.. bed time!<3

so i met a guy named steve today at hot topic.. hes supposedly burning me some cds.. eh.. hes supposed to call at least.

"event","So i found morgan today.. yeah.. shes so much fun! i love her! heh. Man i realized today just how volatile i really am.. heh.. I went off on charlie today for jerking off while watching porn in front of me.. lol.. Im not really sure why.. its not like i dont watch porn.. hmm.. Chuck if your reading this sorry.. lol.. I think it was the fact that i was over there and i havent talked to him in like 3 or 4 weeks... and he just wanted to sit there and watch a bunch of hot girls fuck each other. See that bothers me i guess.. I can see looking at porn sites every once in awhile.. but for fuck's sake.. why every other fucking day?... hmmm *confused* oh well.. Angie.. especially you.. after all the self esteem issues you went through for awhile when you were dating ((*wont say his name*))... and you had the nerve to actually put yourself on SuicideGirls.. tisk tisk.. oh well you arnt on anymore.. heh.. I mean you gotta love SuicideGirls.. but damn...  
I think guys just dont know anything. haha maybe thats it.. or the vast majority of them anyway.
I finally figured out why I dont like to tell people when Im mad... lol.. Angie helped me discover this today when she pissed me off.. hahah.. here goes.. 
Its because the majority of the time when Im upset about something.. its because im jelous.. (like i said in a past entry.. im the most JELOUS person you will ever meet.. *sad but true*.)... and Ive realized that Im jelous all the time.. so its not like im in denial.. but the fact of the matter is.. I dont like being jelous.. there for i convince myself that its not a big deal.. when it really is (to me anyway) and volia! I dont want to tell the person Im jelous.. cuz then its a big deal!
(so in reality im probably really really stressed.. haha because every time i get mad i hold it in until i forget about it!! ha!.. ha!.. ha ha ha! (thats the 'nervous' laugh heheh)
Oh Im so good. I figured that out all on my own with a little help of angie pie.


ANYWAY! THAT WAS A LONG ASS ENTRY. IM GONNA GO HANG OUT IN THE OTHER ROOM.

hmm.. 
Im really tired of being fucked over.. you know those kinds of people that say they are your friend or whatever they may be to you.. and then they just do something that completely fucks up your life or feelings or whatever.. ugh im sick of it.. what reminded me of this is when Jodee and I were chit chatting online and i said, messing with her, something along the lines of ""I feel unwanted now.. RIP MY HEART OPEN, God Jodee now I have to take it to the doctors."" (heh) and she replyed with: ""I'll sew it up for you""... Thats what i could really use right now.. someone to sew my heart up for me.. that may sound really corny and i know it does but i guess its kinda true. No in all actuallity i think that what i really need is just someone to tell me they love me... or would that hurt more? .. eh I dont care.. I just want some one to say it... even if they dont mean it.. even a simple ""your a good friend"" would help. I just feel kinda worthless these days.. its been awhile folks... 
Ahh and another thing.. My self esteem has been super low lately.. Im sure you all have noticed. I think its starting to get to people.. but i cant help it! ... im pretty sure that most of the reason why ive felt this way is/was Derek's doing... eeerk.. I will always hold a grudge agianst him for what he did to me... even though I shouldnt.. (or maybe  should?).. its not even the fact that he cheated on me.. its the fact that he straight up LIED to me.. If he would have been honest with me it would be a whole different story. I suppose I could forgive him someday.. but not anytime too soon i dont believe. =/. 
Ahh.. I guess I have really no room to complain, this week has been better than Ive had in awhile... so i guess things might be looking up for me. =). I wish I wernt such a jelous person though.. thats definatly a flaw of mine. Kinda makes me sick in away though.. I mean.. I have alot to be thankful for.. I shouldnt be feeling sorry for myself. I know im not terrible looking.. and I know my personallity isnt bad either.. but I just dont want to realize it sometimes, Id rather just disagree.. its easier for me to think that way... another reason why I dont think so highly of myself besides all of the reasons ive listed.. is that.. so many people say things to me.. and it means nothing.. very RAREly does anyone say something nice to/about me to my face and i actually feel like they are telling the truth... It does happen.. but not often.. It did happen like last night which suprised me a little bit... I wont go into that though its not nescessary for you people to know everything.. lol.. =).. 
..ick.. i need to lose some weight.. Im not fat.. i know that.. I just feel..blah.. i dunno i cant explain it.. lol...
hmm well thats basically what im feeling at this point.. 

Later."

"event","Ok there was an accident I was involved in on June 29, 2001. and I was the driver without a licence, well aparently I was not going to be charged or sued or anythin' well!!! Just today not long ago I find out that we could be sued  up to $40,000, well fuck I am in the shit hole! I can't believe it, well it just might be the time to call a buddy of mine and make some serious cash! It may not be a good place to go, but it'll pay off my debt! Fuck Fuck Fuck, now we  are being sued!! Damn it!!

"event","Holy damn I just woke up, and I was thinkin' about what happened last night.  Well my best friend Matt and his Bro Giu (Giuliano), are like brothers to me, that is why I had helped Matt'd g/f to stop herself from doin' crazy shit.  Plus my bro(matt) and I had a chat about how I should get closer with my parents , and then maybe they'll like me, ha! Ya right! Everything about me everything I do, it is what they despise the most, I can really ony seek love within' others, whether it is friend, or girlfriend. Yes that would be you Kristina, and of course my 2 bro's! They've always been there for me and I hope it can be the same between me and Kristina, just a little different, but we won't get into that! You know I luv ya Kristina! And as long as we keep in touch, etc. I will always be there for you Kristina, in everyway!
anyway  Laterz, Kyle ---}---@

P.S. I know you didn't forget about me Kristina!! lol, hehehe"

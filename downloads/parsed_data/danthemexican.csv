Big mistake to tell me all your numbers then tell me that you cant do it, shit before you even said the rest of your words i already knew how everything was broken down so by the time you talk i hear all the bullshit your trying to feed me HOMIE!
but anyways i digress, that wasnt a big deal just a little bit annoying.
knee surgery comming up and i cant get over the thought of, i have 3 days left before i go into surgery and start a year of recovery, why the fuck am i at work wasting what little time i have to walk here.
i hate the thought of work, not like work work, just a job.
i dont want to spend most of my days somewhere else just to get paid and achieve some status that in the end doesnt mean shit.

also, i read what i write and go, wow, i could have taken the time to have used better grammer and puncuation but, just like money, does that really matter?

fuck it."

i wont except this fate.

I just need to bit down and keep going.

....why is it that almost anything thats good needs a lot of hard work and dertermination?

well i suppose you wouldnt feel the same if you didnt have to work for it.

but seriously.

I'd do anything to stop following the path i have started to go down.

therefore.

the more and more my mind says give up, or just one more time.

"event","In fact maybe.

i've been so inner focused and concerned about figuring out who i am and who i want to be.
(which I find to be very hard)

that.

In fact.

Those questions will be answered if i just step out of my own office.

find something.

follow through with it.

Putting my own abilities and actions to use will clear the path of uncertainty.

in fact, i've been going about it all wrong.

finding ones self is embedded in doing something you love.










something unrelated that i want to remember.


Waiting for a sign is one of the most illogical things a man could do.


for instance, a man who waits for a sign, is missing the one in front of him.




this translates into.

though sometimes its okay to sit contemplate, or wait for some certainty.
But no one ever accomplished anything with out taking action.

therefore.

if you keep waiting and waiting and waiting for a sign.
your sign that you've waiting for has already shown its self.

Be assertive.

Take Action in what you believe.

if you dont, whats the point in having faith in it?



THIS WOULD GO FOR ALMOST ANYTHING.

and i dont feel like writing it differently, but substitute believe and faith with love and passion. BOOM

doesnt sound as religious.

so there you go.

and this isnt a religious message. just so i dont forget and anyone who reads..."

"event","Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep
I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This 6 string's darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home
And stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

"event","So 3 definite The Blackout shows this week with the potential of going to the Stoke show which was Sean Smith's birthday so we knew would be good...oh how right we were. 
Monday 28th Dec was Leeds at the cockpit. Anna and I saw Neil and Ryann before and after the show which was good because those boys are awesome. 
Time for The Blackout, first time I'd seen them since Rocktober at The Astoria which was over 2 months ago. I'd missed them but wasn't as excited to see them as I'd thought, maybe because of Xmas, maybe because I'd made new friends recently who'd told me things about Sean that I kinda wish I hadn't known because it suddenly made me very disapointed in him. But they were on stage and performed really well as always. The last song of the set was my favourite, I Know You Are But What Am I? I was going mad throughout the set because they'd never played it last before and I thought they mightve dropped it. Thankfully no! 
So we waited about and met some of the boys and spoke again to Sean's brother Jay who drives the van (its his van, Twiddly International Touring Service aka Tits hahah) and then saw Gavin who said he'd be back but got talking to some fans. We then spotted Sean. I thought I'd be fawning all over him as I usually am but it just wasn't there. So we barely said anything tho I stroked his new tache because all the boys decided to keep their facial hair until their albums finished being recorded on Jan 19th 09 all being well. So we didn't really say much or at least I didn't, I think he'd been outside for a while and we'd just not seen him so he went into the club night and we went to speak to Gav for a bit. Then he invited us inside. Saw the band a bit in there but Sean seemed more interested in walking about probably trying to find girls to hook up with...or just wanting people's attention. Then again as I thought at the time, maybe he just didn't wanna speak to us!? So we left. I felt let down and was all oh well bollocks to him if we're not good enough to hang out with! 
Next day Liverpool. Anna had stayed over at mine so we had a lovely cooked brekky and went shopping round lpool then to the gig. We were looking through this window thing cos its a crap venue so if you're on the floor its hard to see. Attack Attack came on after Said Mike who I saw this time last year on Sean's birthday show at Clwb Ifar Bach in Cardiff with the lovely Tom. They were good though the singer looks like he's about 12. I later went up and patted him on the head telling him how cute he was! So Attack Attack came on and I got excited so pushed Anna out the way of this window ledge thingy and was hanging out and like most shows Neil saw me in the crowd and just gave me this look as if to say what on earth are you doing. I questioned him later saying does he not want me to dance and he said no I like your dancing, please dance lol. It was a really good show. But yeah the smile he gave and the look was so cute. Neil's one of the kindest sweetest people I've ever met, he reminds me a little of what Jake Wambold formerly of shitheads Aiden was like. So that ruled, then The Blackout came on. I danced. Didn't think it was as good as Leeds but we had a different setlist tonight, they started with I'm a Riot You're a Fucking Riot which was strange as that's normally the last song. They played Its High Tide Baby as the last song which seemed a strange choice at the time but over the last few shows actually seemed genius as its a right sing along song. 
We grabbed our coats from the cloakroom and headed outside! Saw all of Attack Attack again and actually had a conversation with Will which was weird because he's a very strange guy! But it made me look good because we'd seen Gav already outside then I left him to go find Neil telling Neil I just left Gav Butler to come talk to you, he wasn't impressed and I was trying to make him realise that as Gav was in the headlining band I should be fawning all over him but he was having none of it, instead winding me up again saying he didn't even know who I was as the night before at Leeds he said he didn't know my name and generally being stupid with me, which I really liked because already we have a thing that he doesn't have with others...I dunno. So he was doing that again so I asked if we were still ok for guestlist for stoke as I'd been told The Blackout's guestlist was full what with it being Sean's birthday but he said Anna was on the list and he didn't know my name but eventually confirmed it was fine and that I could actually have my friend Lina on aswell as she lives in Stoke. Then I was told Sean was round the corner. I carried on talking to Will and Neil then said I suppose I better go say hi.  So I left Will and walked round to Sean. Before this I'd like to point out that I met Danny from McFly who was apparently stood quite near us inside the show. So I met him said my niece loves your band and he told Anna who was my photographer as usual that he thought I said my knees loved the band. He was nice, really good looking in real life. 
So I walked round and one by one my friends hugged Sean but I ignored him and then looked up and he had his arms out to hug so I tutted and made a point of him knowing I wasn't gonna be all over him like usual. So we hugged and straight away he knew something was up and said oh denied when I didn't wanna hug him and I said how would you know what being denied is you have people at you all the time. So he said ""what's up with you you're being very moody, you were lovely last night"" I thought how the fuck would you know that you barely spoke to us! So I just chickened out and said it was because he'd stopped doing sexy hips on stage and so he said if he did it would I explode and I said possibly, so he said that can be my birthday present, I said what my death and he said yes your death through orgasmic rush! Knobhead!! So we chatted more then he went back inside so we talked to Snoz a bit who is so lovely. Then eventually Sean came back out. He's such an arse but was winding me up again and all was forgiven. I dunno what it is with him he seems to have this power over people. I think maybe its because I'm told he's quite insecure and i'm just waiting for the day where he opens up and we become actual friends, doubt that it'll happen but you never know!?
So it was about midnight I think when we all left, possibly after. We headed back to Anna's and went to bed. I had half day off and left Anna's at half 9. Work sucked as usual but it was all good as I knew we were going to Stoke and that night would be awesome. It was!"

"event","So I still need to update this about Rocktober because this next bit wont necessarily make sense as in people might think 'how the hell did that happen'.  Long story short, DARRAN SMITH IS A FUCKING LEGEND!!!!!!

Basically during Rocktober we were told by the sexual Sean Smith (yeah I know he's a tit but I cant help it!) told us that his band The Blackout were gonna be going on tour with Funeral for A Friend, so I asked Matthew, the singer of said band and he said yes its true so I was like ooh.  Some friends and I started looking into costs and stuff and thought right, this could very well be doable.  Anyway a few weeks later when talking to Matthew he said that The Blackout had to pull out so we were talking to Darran of FFAF at their Leeds show (FYI Leeds is the BEST place ever...) and he said ""oh so because The Blackout have pulled out you're not coming to see us"" so I was like no *I* really wanna go but my friends arent so bothered now.  So the lovely Anna said joking to him, if you pay our flight and guest us we'll come, so he said I cant pay your flight but I cant see why guesting would be a problem.

So yeah.  Yesterday at about 4.10pm (Friday) I got a myspace message (in reply to one I sent a few days ago) saying the following:
""Hey Lynz....yeah that'll be ok let me know which show u wanna come to for sure and i'll sort it...its for you & your hubby right?! 

Darran.Funeral""

Can we all say arrrrrrrggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh how frikkin amazing is that!!!  So then I'm telling my Mum as she was feeling pretty down so I was trying to take her mind off things and I said if I cant get the money together (have enough for flights right now but nothing for accom or spend) so she has only gone and said she will LEND US THE MONEY!!!!  So yeah.  We're going to LOS ANGELES BABY!  In my message to Darran I'd said either LA, New York or Mexico City so thats why he's saying yeah just let me know which show.  Words cant express how excited I am.

Rocktober and Noizember updates to come shortly.  Not that anyone except Jess and Dazey read this, its more for my own personal use.  Espesh come the next few weeks when I start stalking more boys hahah!  Mostly Welsh, some American.  Niiiiiiiiice. xx

"event","Damn I really need to update this thing more its been over a year haha. 
So since this time last year there have obvs been numerous gigs and its all been good fun. Seen the awesome Funeral For A Friend like 7 times this past year and have a new band that I'm loving but it could mostly be because of the singer.  To summarize: after I went to see The Sleeping which is where this thing leaves off I then went to Taste of Chaos because my friend Jake's band was playing so he guested me, bless him. So I saw Taste of Chaos in Leeds and there started my obsession for yet another welsh band. I know them as 'those Welsh gits' but others will know them as The Blackout. I'd heard of them so thought I'd check out their set before Aiden came on who was the main band I'd gone to see as I've known them years. So The Blackout come on and I remember thinking hey these are quite good I'll have to download some stuff. Next was Aiden then Gallows then The Used. I used to hate them with a passion but got into their latest cd at the time and then downloaded earlier stuff and thought Fuck they're actually quite good. I even developed a crush on Bert McCracken...god knows why. It was purely physical haha! Anyway yeah talked to Troy a lot who worked for Aiden at the time as he is my friends brother. Didn't see Jake unfortunately but met Wil Francis again who was a right moody bastard. The singer of The Blackout came out and said hi to me. I looked him up and down and said ""hello?"" then he signed stuff for fans and got on Aiden's bus. I only knew him as being that gay blonde one from The Blackout. I shouldve been more polite lol. Anyway I then went to see FFAF in Cardiff in December and met this blonde singer again. A friend of mine said ""if you see Sean Smith tell him I said hi"" as they used to chat on msn. I saw the blonde one after meeting my hero Matthew Davies from FFAF again (and making a new friend called Anna who shall be mentioned in later posts) and waited for this Sean person. We chatted, he was an arse but frikkin hilarious. I had fanpics done, we chatted for about half an hour he was one of the most obnoxious arrogant people I've ever met...but I couldn't stop talking about him and looking at the video message he did for Tom ""Tom, Sean, Sean, Tom. We know each other obviously. Can't believe you're not in Cardiff, what a sellout, you say you like my band, you like my band you woulda been ere! But you can make it up to me we're playing Clwb Ifar Bach...and its my BIRTHDAY aswell! So if you don't come! Don't ever come to another Blackout show again"" stuck 2 fingers up at the camera and stuck his tongue out! What a git. But I thought he was hilarious. He then ran across the road to get into his band's van after I told him Nine Inch Nails sucked harder than his band. I spoke with Tom and we arranged to go to Sean's birthday show on the 28th December! So we went. It was awesome, 2nd row the whole gig. I filmed loadsa songs and met the rest of the band. Saw Sean before and after and he remembered me which I thought was cool. Saw them again on their tour in February in Manchester and Wolves. Developed a love for his Hips, so much so that when seeing them play in Camden at the end of Feb I had a picture taken with me pretending to lick his Hips. Chatted ages again after each show by which point he knew exactly who I was. We were both verbally abusive towards each other but it was all a laugh. Saw him ""DJ"", ok itunes on shuffle haha in April in liverpool and then at Give It A Name in May. Saw them support Story of the Year in Manchester in May then at Slamdunk in Leeds. Then again in July when they supported Mindless Self Indulgence in Notts and again at Leeds Festival in August. They did their own tour in Rocktober (that update will follow later) and seeing them again in December. Got guested for their shows in Newcastle and Sheffield and have spoken to him every show I've ever seen, except Newcastle cos he was in a mood tho did apologise (for the summertime lol). So since November 25th 2007 I've seen The Blackout 17 times! I love the band and I'm SO obsessed with Sean Smith that they're trying to ban me saying his name at work. He knows my name and I wouldn't say we're friends as such but being guested and hanging out after shows is pretty cool oh and the occasional facebook chat . Like I said more to come about the Rocktober gigs later. But so mostly this past year since my Last update has revolved around him. Ooh I forgot I also saw the band at Wakestock in North Wales and had a song dedicated to us by the lovely Gav. We are known as the Northern Slags, it was originally the Northern Crew then the Northern Ninja's then Sean decided to call me the Northern Slag cos he knew I fancied him just a little bit...ok a lot lol. So we saw Gav before their set and I said you can dedicate the Sexy Hips song and he said I can't believe you still don't know its name. ""I know you are but what am I?""  So they're onstage in front thousands of people and Sean said ""this next song is dedicated to all the girls"" and then Gav said ""especially those Northern Slags there"" and pointed to us as we were on the barrier. How cool is that haha! I love those boys! So yeah like I said that's pretty much all I've done this past year is go see The Blackout. There's been other bands too like seeing Finch again and meeting Nate and chatting ages whilst he was drunk. Funtimes. I love my shows they rule and there's more to come. Woo and indeed Yeah!! XxxX"

"event","Hello. So the last time I updated this I was sick and I've been sick again since but its all good cos I got half a day off work so that was good.  

So it was about 5 weeks ago that I met Dave Grohl and yet I still seem to mention it every day lol. Oh yes, I rock!! What's been happening then?  Well I met a girl online called Tash who's as in love with Funeral For A Friend as me which is pretty cool. So she told me that as part of MTV2 Gonzo's 5t Birthday, Funeral are headlining a show in Birmingham which is like 3 hours drive away or rather train so that's not 2 bad, just means I've got to somehow get out of work at before 3 but its gonna be hard because its Eid so they won't let me have the day off because a lot of staff will be off celebrating which is fair enough. But yeah I just have to try and get out as soon as poss then go get the train and meet Tash for the first time ever. I've seen pics and talked online a fair bit to her, she seems preety cool, a lot like myself haha.  What else?  Ooh I bought a car. Its a black L Reg Fiesta Ghia 1.3 which probs means as much to anyone reading this as it does me...not a great deal. But yeah he's beautiful, all pimped out with pink inside, front and back seats, windscreen wipers, fluffy dice, steering wheel cover, gear stick cover. All pink. Also car matts front and back. I've called him Frankie after Frank Iero cos he's a big gay bear isn't he as is my car hahah. Sad yes but I don't give a fuck!

I've not been to a concert since...Foo Fighters where I met Dave Grohl [see, mentioned EVERY day lol] and I can't wait to get into the swing of things again. I'm hoping to go see The Sleeping next week, I'm just waiting on the lovely Jess to see if she can go, she said she'd let me know today but she's been at uni all day and I think working tonight so I'll wait and se what she says. I really hope she says yes cos The Sleeping don't get to play in the UK very often so I really hope she agrees.  Then I've got Funeral For A Friend in 10 days then a comdy show at the end of Oct then possibly Mindless Self Indulgence tho not sure yet. Then November I have SO much coming up, got Enter Shikari, then MY CHEM [yey] then Machine Head then Kaiser Chiefs, then Manic Street Preachers [on guestlist for that apparently] then maybe Aiden at Taste Of Chaos, then....who else oh HIM then Funeral For A Friend about 4 times on the same tour.  I just LOVE that band. So yeah am gonna be busy. Oh and how could I miss out the AWESOME Still Remains, I'm seeing them too. Can't wait.

Not much else to report, give it a few weeks and I'l be updating all the time lol.

"event","So on Friday last week I was told that I've finally got my permanent job at work so that was pretty awesome.  Then I had a 2 hour driving lesson and I kicked ass, well no I suck at reversing round corners but I'm getting better and with amy luck I should be ready to take my driving test by Christmas woohoo.

So then Saturday was also my SIX year Wedding Anniversary which was awesome, we just went to friends and played PS2 games it was hilarious.  We didn't celebrate more than that because we were going away on tuesday...

Tuesday we drove 4 and a half hours from Leeds to Edinburgh because the awesome Foo Fighters were headlining T On The Fringe with Nine Inch Nails as support.  We stayed at the Malmaison which was lovely.   So we got a taxi to the Meadowbank Stadium and were like OMG this is such a dive but once in the standing area was like wow this is cool cos it was a hell of a lot smaller than I thought. So we got food and drink and found a spot to watch Nine Inch Nails. I've never been a fan of theirs before and I know why, they were very dull to watch live and since I only knew their last 2 songs I felt like their show dragged, had they been more visually impressive then the fact I knew only 2 songs from an hour set wouldn't have been a problem.  Anyway we then managed to get right on the barrier to the far left of the stage so I could see Dave Grohl but not Taylor but he's behind drums so you can't see him anyway.  They came on and played Everlong first which was amazing as always and then went straight into Monkey Wrench I was like OMG I could go home now lol they're my 2 fave Foos songs haha.  Anyway after playing for about 2 hours they ended with All My Life and it was just amazing. I've seen the Foo Fighters a few times live and they're always amazing you just can't fault them.  After the show my bloke and I walked round the entire venue trying to work out where the tourbuses might be and eventually found some people sat down. After probably half an hour or so 2 tourbuses came driving out and didn't even stop, I was a bit disapointed cos there were only about 10 of us so it wouldn't have taken long to sign stuff and have pics done so we got a taxi back to the hotel, ordered food which was rank and fell asleep watching South Park.

In the morning I got up and had a shower and we checked out, thankfully we'd not been charged for the food because we complained. All I wanted was cheese on toast and it came up smelling [like Dave Grohls favourite cheese] stinking bishop but when tasting it, it was rank. Turns out it had worcester sauce on it but it doesn't say that in the menu so no charge woohoo.  So we drove into Edinburgh and walked around a bit and had some food.  Then we're just randomly walking past a hotel and what do I see, the 2 tourbuses from last nights concert.  So we loitered and I saw Taylor Hawkins and Dave Grohl in the Balmoral Hotel foyer. How random?  So we waited about 5 minutes and met Dave and Taylor. Chris Shiflett came out first but I waited and saw Dave but people jumped on him so I went to talk to Taylor Hawkins. He said he was doing fist taps or something lol. So I fist tapped him and told him they were amazing last night and he said thanks then Dave was about to leave so I grabbed him and said hi we drove from Leeds yesterday you were amazing he was like all the way from Leeds and I said yeah 4 and a half hours. I then fell off the kerb and he said careful girl or something like that then I put my arm round him and said I'm really sorry can I just get a picture with you, we posed for the pic and I said thank you so much. And that was that. But talk abour right time right place. I've gone on about it ever since and it was only a few hours ago lol.

Now driving back home, still over an hour to go yet. Oh well.

Now all I have to do is meet Frerard and get awesome pics and film footage cos by the time I see them in November they'll probably be giving each other oral on stage if recent antics are anything to go by lol.

Awww today is a happy day.  Back at work tomorrow which blows but hey its bank holiday soon so I get 4 days off woohoo.

"event","I was just dancing to Paramore in my bedroom and fell against the wall. Now my arm which looks like I've got a fkn carpet burn on, my back and my neck are all aching, I sorta banged into it cos I lost my footing on my bed then slid down the wall hahahahah.  I'm not actually 14 lol, I'm just an idiot...

Today I realised that I really do have to stop moaning about my job, I've got like 60+ cases and instead of actually organising things to make it more manageable I've just been panicking and thinking I haven't got enough time to do stuff when I probably could've got more done if I'd spent less time worrying about how much time I have to do stuff.

I'm becoming more and more [b]obsessed with My Chemical Romance and in particular the whole Frerard thing.  Its not that I'm a perv or anything and its not that I think its hot [though it blates is lol] I just think its hilarious and the MCR boys are just playing up for the fans though the footage I've seen of Frank rubbing Gerards head against his crotch makes me think there is defo something more than just them playing up for the fans...but then saying that I've known completely straight lads kiss each other because they're trying to see who will back out first.  Both my Dad and brother [who are not actually related] are gay so I'm all for homosexuality lol.  I think maybe I'm into the Frerard stuff cos 1. Boylove IS pretty hot lol but fluffy too so its cute. 2. Cos Gerard Way and Frank Iero are both really gorgeous men and 3. My Chemical Romance frikkin rock.  A friend of mine was into them from the beginning but says she's over them now, I think her love for them just transferred onto me. I kinda feel guilty that I'm obsessed with them now when she was into them from the start. I only got into them when my friend asked me to download their 2 albums and we saw them support Taking Back Sunday, I think that was the begining of 05. So I've liked them a long time I just like them more now than I did previously.  I think the whole package in general, all the fanfic stuff and the Frerardness and of course the music I think I love so much because its a welcome distraction from what's really going on around me.

I don't know why I'm so unhappy, I've got a home and a bloke who loves me and 2 beautiful cats and I get whatever I want in terms of being able to buy stuff...yet I'm just not happy. Maybe its time for something to change.  Maybe I should quit my job??  I dunno.

I plan on proper updating this thing from now on cos its good for me to get stuff out on.  So until next time xxx"

"event","Hello

So I've not been in this thing in like over a year...so where the hell do I start.

Well I'm still not pregnant, those of you that know me pretty well will know that I've wanted kids forever and its so the right time but because of my stupid job I have to either try and get preggers and then just have to leave after my 6 month contract is up or I have to look for another job thats permanent which I dont really wanna do and plus its not fair to  the new company that I end up working for.

So the past 12 months (from jan to Dec, even though I havent written in this since May 05) has been AWESOME!  I've made some very good friends, I've been let down, I've had awful things happen but mostly its been a good year.

In January I met some boys in an american band who were supporting another band I love, and we hung out and became friends (I have email and phone number to prove it lol) - I met them in Notts and got talking to lots of amazing people who were so so nice to me, then I met the same people again and thanks to Marie I got dragged onto buses and it just went from there.  I befriended the awesome Jess last year via the wonder that is myspace and I made stronger friendships with people that I've known for years.  In Feb I met up with american band again and hung out in London, that was fun.  Jess kicked Steve or Dave or whatever his name is from that Busted band (not Fightstar, the other one that sucks hard), she kicked him up the arse so that was fun.  Then there was more fun in April again with same people.  May was GIAN 2006 which was much fun but also a  bit of a letdown as I didnt see 2 people I really wanted to see.  Then June was Download, that was ace cos I was with my Dazey and she kicks ass no matter what she thinks (yes you do biatch so shut it) - and also my Mum came to the last day of Download for Guns n Roses so it was ace.  July was Guns n Roses again, then August was my 30th Birthday - that was scary but I had a good time, 3 celebrations no less.  September was party time for Victory Records and that was proper ace as Jess might say.  

On October 30th my friend Grant killed himself.  Apparently he was depressed...I didnt know!  I loved him a lot, he was my bitch.  Anytime I needed him he was there.  We had a vibe, and I used to think about him in all kindsa weird scenario's lol.  But yeah, I found out on Halloween and ended up taking 2 weeks off work cos of it, but it gave me time to think and I got lots in my head sorted out.

November we saw Bullet with the awesome Jess, Gem and Chelle, Marie was back darn sarf, which sucked cos I havent seen her since September and that was only brief.  And so far in December I have seen the Lost Prophets with my ace friend Sarah from work and then the day after was Manics which was ok but crapped over by the fact that my friend had 4 epileptic seizures within about 2 hours - how scary was that!

Yesterday I saw Iron Maiden with Jess.  It would have been a lot better had Gems, Marie and Chelle been there but unforseen circumstances and all that.  The highlight of the night??  Singing Taking Back Sunday and Trivium songs in Jess' car lol!  And I did all that research learning a variety of Maiden songs only to have em play 2 that I knew througout the entire 2 nights.  So that sucked.

So yeah, thats pretty much it.  I plan on updating this more often cos I always have to repeat everything to everyone.

Happy Xmas xxxxx"

"event","Just a quick one to say that the GIAN (see above subject) fucking rocked!  I didnt think much to the majority of the bands and really didnt get to see many of them due to utter crapness of the venue and the whole catering debacle (queing for approx 3 hours then getting nothing in the end!)

But I was blown away by Finch and of course, my boys FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND!!!

Unfortunately no stalking this time as James was having none of it ""how we gonna get back to the hotel Lynsey, what taxi is gonna come up this hill Lynsey"" etc!  Haha!  But FFAF were ace!  I highl recommend them!

Had a fab day in London with Dazey and Ali and had a great time at Dazey's on the sunday!  More details to come later!

Going to bed its frikkin late!!!!!!!!"

"event","I'm sick!  I have a cold and its so nasty!  So I'm not at work - yey!

Made a tee today for the Give it a name gig on Monday next week!  I cant wait for that its gonna rock!  I'm only really going cos I get to see Funeral For A Friend who I've fallen madly in love with since seeing them (and meeting them) at last years Leeds Festival.  So I cant wait for that!

I'm worried about some friends.  One of them seems to be doing ok although maybe I just manage to cheer her up, or maybe cos we dont actually know each other that well she's not telling me everything, which is a shame cos I'd really like to be there for her.  My other friend is one of my best friends and I love her to bits and she's not doing so good and it upsets me.  I know she needs time away and everything but I just wish I knew how to help her.  I believe she's off to see her Doc this morning so hopefully she'll get help.  I'm going to spend the weekend with her coming up so that'll be good.

Other than that things are fine with me.  I dont have any burning issues today that I feel the need to talk about which is good.  

uh-oh coughing fit!  nasty!!!!

So long xxx"

"event","Well I'm bloody full of cold and it sucks!  Have been feeling pretty crappy for days now but its got worse this morning, thought I had a nose bleed with all the snot that was dripping *gross I know*.

So am now both physically and mentally unwell.  Last time I was on here I was having issues with a friend of mine thinking he was the one for me etc but nah, we're just mates and thats the way it will stay!  I love him to bits lol!  Anyway since then things have changed in many ways and I decided to finally go see my GP for mood swings and the whole issue of thinking should I be with someone else etc!  Turns out I have to see a Clinical Psychologist!!!  Doc says I have lotsa issues that are best being dealt with by a Specialist!  So just waiting for the referral to come through!  In the meantime I'm sat full of snog and boogies!!!  But its all good cos this weekend I am going to spend time with my best and her baby so I cant wait for that!  

Right now however I will continue to watch the Charmed Weekend Spesh on Sky!

Love to all!

"event","Hey.

So better day at work today.  Assessments all fine.  Had lunch with the gorgeous James today.  He said I was his best friend, how cool is that.  He's sooooooo yummy lol!

We have a new person started at work.  Her name is Carlie, she seems nice.  Clearly a lesbian which of course isnt a problem!

I cant seem to be bothered with anything this week.  I'm just really really looking forward to the Leeds Festival this weekend.  I'm only going on Sunday though to see a band called Thursday and also Funeral For A Friend.  I'm going with James and his Dad.  He told me today that he's not told his parents much about me. I've met his Dad once before but only very briefly, whereas this time we'll be spending the whole day together lol!  So I said, ""Have you told your parents I'm married?"" and he said ""No"" So I plan on embarassing him a lot that day hahahah *rubs hands together and laughs hysterically*.  Also next weekend we are going to see a band called Taking Back Sunday and spending the weekend together in London!  I really cant wait!  I feel like sometimes I just want to be with him all the time, he makes me feel really good about myself.  Then when I am actually with him its always good but I get a bit upset because I know its going to end soon!  Also because I am married I get really confused as to what I should actually be feeling.  I think the main feeling I have towards him is that I know I cant have him because I'm married.  Probably if anything did ever happen I would feel really bad and guilty and it wouldnt be what I wanted after all!  Hahah hence the reason for the title of this journal ""Confusing Life"".  But dont worry all is good.  James is one of my best friends and I love him to bits.  He's too stubborn for me though and it would just ruin our friendship I think.  But sometimes it would be nice to see if anything did actually happen!  I'm sure we'll have lots of fun whatever happens!

So nothing else to talk about.  I'm gonna watch Friends for a bit then go to bed I think, I was at work at 5 past 8 this morning.  Am knackered!

Night xx"

"event","So ok this is the first time I've done this and not quite sure what to put in here but here goes anyway.

Yesterday at work I got a bollocking because I called a male member of staff the ""bosses bitch"" which is totally a name he has given himself so anyway because he cant cope with the new responsibility he has been given he made a complaint about me.  So this now means that I have to be really careful about what I say.  Professionalism is of the utmost importance in my job (I work for the local Council).

Today was much better though but I've had to really watch what I say incase anyone is offended as I really dont want any more complaints made about me.  Its been do difficult not making bitchy comments about people.  It was like I'd been bound and gagged (and not in a good way lol) all day, so as soon as I got out of work I unloaded all my negative comments lol.  We have this new guy that I am referring to as being an Asian Shrek.  And No I'm not being offensive or racist, he is an asian person but looks just like Shrek lol!  

Went for coffee with my friend James who is like my best mate at work and who I also have a bit of a thing for.  At the moment its all fine but there are times and days where I get confused.  See cos I am married I know I shouldnt have feelings like this for another bloke, but sometimes its really hard!  But at the mo all is good.

Anyway now I've created this thing I'm gonna leave it for now and go to bed, its getting late.

Night xxxx"

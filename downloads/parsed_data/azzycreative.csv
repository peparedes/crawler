"event","This weekend I finally started working on a picture I drew of one of my characters and scanned into the computer a couple of weeks ago. His name is Conor Castel. I inked and colored it in paint shop pro. It took me several hours to finish this. (and plenty of aspirin. lol) Below is a close up of his face.

What the hell is it? What was I thinking??? Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing yet. But you know what? I had fun doing it. And sometimes that's all that matters."

"event","I finally colored in that picture I drew a few weeks ago. I'm placing it behind the cut tag. This time I used Paint Shop Pro 8 to ink and color it. I'm fairly happy with everything except the shirt. I still need a ton of practice on drawing/coloring the folds on clothes.

"event","I've been feeling a little down lately. I guess I miss having any online friends that I really connect with, who share my interests. Having friends to chat with on yahoo was fun. Now everything is so quiet. :(

Anyway... this is a picture I drew and colored in with paint shop pro several months ago. It's of 2 characters from my old yaoi role playing board.

This is my latest practice piece, following an image drawn in the book, ""How to draw wizards, warriors, orcs, and elves.""

"event","My (mis)adventures in learning how to draw continues. I plan to sit my butt down and practice today for at least 2-3 hours. I'm still following the ""How to draw wizards, etc."" book I picked up a few weeks ago.

Here's another book I got at Borders for the bargain price of $4.99. It's a hardcover with 160 pages.

<img src=""http://www.geocities.com/azayamage/drawings2/anatomybk2.jpg"">

 I've worked with it a little so far and it's great. I'll probably post some of the anatomy drawings I did at some point. But today, I'm showing off my drawings of feet! Yep, feet. lol Who knew those puppies would be so difficult to draw?

"event","Last night I download a 3-D graphic program similar to Poser from this link. <a href=""http://www.daz3d.com/i.x/software/studio/-/?"">Daz Studio</a> It's ""Tell-ware"" which means I have to tell 2 people about it. So I'm starting off by mentioning it on my blog. I guess they make their money from the various 3-d models and other add ons you can buy for the program. 

The program looks mighty intimidating since I've never worked with 3-D art before. It reminds me of the first time I opened paint shop pro and freaked because I had no idea what to do next. lol I keep telling myself to go slow, that I don't have to learn it all in one day. There are several tutorials to follow so I guess I'll start there and try to tackle a little every day or so to keep myself from getting overwhelmed. 

I think I better get to work on coloring one of my drawings soon too so I don't forget how to do it. When you don't use something for a while you tend to forget the necessary steps...at least I do. At one time I used to zip through creating web pages with html but now I've forgotten a lot of the coding tags since I haven't played around with a web page in a LONG time. I was starting to get really good with css too until that sort of fell by the wayside. Now, whenever I look at my main web page that I did in css I find myself saying, ""Wow, how the hell did I do that?"" lol   

Well, enough talking about this...I better get to working on something."

<img src=""http://www.geocities.com/azayamage/drawings2/book707a.jpg"">

Now I have almost one small shelf filled with ""how to draw"" books. I'm such a sucker for books. lol 

Anyhoo, using characters from the new book as a reference I managed to draw the following...

One day, I hope to be able to draw something without using a reference, but I think it's too early for that yet. I still spend a lot of time drawing circles, cubes, cylinders, etc."

Hopefully, this journal will help me keep track of my journey in art."

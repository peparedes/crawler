"event","eh....just thought I'd leave a quote for anyone who reads this because it expresses my thoughts alot of the time. I found it in ""The Basic Writings of Nietzsche"", in his essay ""Birth of a Tragedy"". In an old legend, King Midas hunted for Silenus, a friend of Dionysus (the creative, un-bordered free spirit). He caught Silenus and said ""what was the best and most desirable things for man."" Silenus laughed and replied, ""Oh, wretched ephemeral race, children of chance and misery, why do you compel me to tell you what it would be most expedient for you not to hear? What is best is utterly beyond your reach: not to be born, not to be, to be nothing. But the second best for you is- to die soon.""

Of course I'm not suicidal, but eh the things Silenus speaks has crossed my mind many times. Now get the fuck out of here."

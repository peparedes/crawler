So prosaic and awkward and all
D'you think you've got me down?
D'you think I've never been out of this town?

Do I seem too eager to please to you now?
You don't know me at all
I can't turn it on, turn it off like you now
I'm not like you now

Now you're here
I bet you're wishing you could disappear
I'm trying to be kind
I get the feeling you're just killing time

You look down on me
Don't you look down on me now
You don't know me at all
<b>A slap in the face
In the face for you now
Just might do now</b>

You're leaving so soon
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick
To change your tune
Don't look back
If I'm a weight around your neck
Cos if you don't need me
I don't need you

Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah!
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah!

Leaving so soon, soon
Leaving, leaving so, soon

You're leaving so soon
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick

Don't look back
If I'm a weight around your neck
Cos if you don't need me
Then I don't need you

Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah!"

<lj-cut>

god damn you Phil Collins...not to mention anything by Chicago and for sentimental reasons, the entire 28 days later soundtrack.
my mind and life are forever fucked thanks to my out of whack emotions and having got in touch a bit much with my ""feminine side""
the sappy side that cries like a newborn baby bitch late at night...after gorging and indulging in fatty sugary foods.ugh.
i hate myself when i cry. why do i feel the need to share? i want my pain and suffering and torturing crippling misery for public display i suppose to show...i am human after all. you god damn bastards!


that god damn Tarzan song...
Come stop your crying, it will be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here dont you cry

For one so small,you seem so strong
My arms will hold you keep you safe and warm
This bond between us cant be broken
I will be here dont you cry

And youll be in my heart
Yes, youll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart
Always

Why cant they understand the way we feel
They just dont trust what they cant explain
I know were different but deep inside us
Were not that different at all

And youll be in my heart
Yes, youll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart
Always

Dont listen to them, cause what do they know
We need each other, to have and to hold
Theyll see in time, I know

When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you, but you gotta hold on
Theyll see in time, I know

Well show them together cuz...

Youll be in my heart
I believe, youll be in my heart
Ill be there from this day on
Now and forever more

Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart always

Always...
Ill be with you
Ill be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Ill be there always

""SCRATCH"" by Allister
 Ive been sitting here for hours 
 a burning image of you in my mind 
 finding comfort in the words you say 
 but its not the same 

 I know you're worth the wait 
 and I cant explain what Im going through inside 
 But I would turn away the world 
 just to have her here with me tonight 

 take our time 
 making sure that everything feels right 
 it wont be easy 
 but im not afraid 
 she's so far away 

 you better start from scratch 
 its now or never 
 but we cant look back 
 I need you with me 
 for another day 
 shes so far away 
 yeah far away 

 Ive been sitting here forever 
 your voice is resonating in my mind 
 countless hours with you on the phone 
 and now im not alone 
 I know youre worth the wait 
 and I cant escape 
 what Im going through inside 
 but I would turn away the world 
 just to have her here with me tonight 

 I know theres no time left for second chances 
 Still we're right despite these circumstances 
 Youve changed me more than you could ever know 
 So we will just hang on until tomorrow 
 so take my hand 
 dont ever let me go


""GHOST OF A CHANCE"" by Rush
 Like a million little doorways
 All the choices we made
 All the stages we passed through
 All the roles we played

 For so many different directions
 Our separate paths might have turned
 With every door that we opened
 Every bridge that we burned

 Somehow we find each other
 Through all that masquerade
 Somehow we found each other
 Somehow we have stayed
 In a state of grace

 I don't believe in destiny
 Or the guiding hand of fate
 I don't believe in forever
 Or love as a mystical state
 I don't believe in the stars or the planets
 Or angels watching from above
 But I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love
 And make it last...

 Like a million little crossroads
 Through the backstreets of youth
 Each time we turn a new corner
 A tiny moment of truth

 For so many different connections
 Our separate paths might have made
 With every door that we opened
 Every game we played

 Somehow we find each other
 Through all that masquerade
 Somehow we found each other
 Somehow we have stayed
 In a state of grace

 I don't believe in destiny
 Or the guiding hand of fate
 I don't believe in forever
 Or love as a mystical state
 I don't believe in the stars or the planets
 Or angels watching from above
 But I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love
 And make it last..."

(i have no reason to refer  you as SHE or HER of my ""EX"" .you have a name. as do i. try not too hard to forget that.


surely,any girl of my dreams would be able to say she likes this band...and this song.
we played this song on new years eve...and it spoke to me. as i sung the words.
once again. lyrics jumping out and slapping me in the face.
how appropriate. that i continue to be reminded of you by being slapped in the face even long after you have gone away and are unable to touch me. not that you would,because you dont believe in violence. 

i awoke this morning to the sound of the girl next door screaming f words and such and then crying hysterically.
wonderful way to start your day. i thought i was dreaming of you.


anways. here is the worlds smallest violin to play a song by MY FAVORITE FUCKING BAND.NOT YOURS.Lagwagon.
sex and violins. lame.

TAKE A FUCKIN LOOK AT THE WORDS OF THIS SONG. AND PICTURE ME SINGING IT TO YOU.
thats how it is supposed to be read. only picture me singing it less drunk than i was on New Years Eve.



VIOLINS
I am just another fool, and I have to, keep telling myself that
I am just a hypocrite, and I have to, keep calling you one
And I forgot to bite my tongue, as my assumption, is the mother of all mistakes
So I assume the role, open my mouth, and clumsy words escape

So why you, wanna be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away

I awake with your replacement, a bottle in my grasp, in an unfamiliar place
Because you put me out, the butt of a sick joke, into this ashtray life
As you come and go, cause I forgot to service you, and we broke down
And you can't live with my mistakes, but I assume false grace
Open my arms and grasp at something true

[chorus]
How are you, how have you been, girl I miss you, wanna see you again
<b>So why you, wanna be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away </b>

<b>I bring out the worst in you, and you try to let me know
You bring out the worst in me, anxiety, anxiety </b>
I'm trying to let you go, you say I'm giving you the creeps
So I assume the role, open my claws and grasp for your heart

[repeat chorus]
Into you like a mortal stake so vindictive
<b>Your love's slipping away </b>

Violins, into this ashtray life
Violins, the butt of your sick joke
<b>Violins, I'm trying hard to let you go </b>
Violins"

"event","the hardest part by far of all this...not the court costs,the bail bonds,the jail time,the humilation already suffered by us both,the prosecution,the legal mumbo jumbo,the lack of sleep,the loss of appetite,the uncontrollable tear shedding,the constant reminders,the empty apartment (i have chosen to stay) the chills,the nausea,the upset stomach,the time missed at work,how much my next much needed paycheck will suck,the what ifs and how comes....any of these pale in comparison to my condition of release stating that i am unable to contact someone i have spoken to everyday of the last 2 years of my life...no questions,no answers...no chance for an apology....no saying god damn goodbye.

she is going back to TX. i thought they said you cant go back home.
well i suppose i did. so can she.
i really didnt wanna come back. i wish now i had either never come back or never left to begin with.
i was coerced and pushed to move sooner than i had planned from the beginning.
then i was pressured into a compromise on sharing another one bedroom apartment after one failed previous attempt.
there wont be a third chance at striking out.
this pain is crippling. mentally,psychically traumatizing.
for the both of us,
i am still human after all.
i am not a monster.
i was blinded by rage,
and unbeknownst to some...fueled by alcohol.
coming home to an emppty apartment raised some questions. where is she? how did she get there? how long will she be gone?
only took me 2 guesses to discover the sad reality...she was left with other choice than hide out from me rather confront me on our problems.
i hope it wasnt all her idea. i stressed how much i preferred honesty and openness REGARDLESS of whether the other person liked what you had top say.
holding it in,keeping it bottled up,trying to supress it with drinking....NEVER DOES ANYONE ANY GOOD.

i am sick.
i need help.
i agreed to come home to FL with empty promises and unfulfilled aspirations at getting a fresh new start.

i cant tell anyone how to live anymore.

i can only hope ...that attempt can be made to distance one self from such unfortunate incidents...and better one self through not living in the past.
by not going back to what is familiar. steer clear of negative influences and dangerous environments. without naming names or pointing fingers....there are those who will now claim to be there for you,but where have they been up until now.
you should know by now who youre real friends are. 
or are they only there when THEY themselves need something.
same can be said for family members....you know who to turn to,
and you know who to avoid.

again...by no means can i control your decisions or sway your opinions in any way...its not up to me anymore.
its all in your hands,
myself...i now that poisoning myself with mind altering substances got me in this mess...maybe its time i cut back on some excessive/compulsive habits of my own.
try not to fall back in the same tired groove that wore you out last time around.
find another groove to get into.
you know the kind of job you are capable of obtaining.
finish out that schooling you were wanting to wrap up once and for all.
make it that much closer to the next stage in life.
and dont look back.
perhaps...and this is a long shot...but it may do some good to try out some outside advice. therapy.
psychiatric?  i dont think youre the one that needs any,
possibly from some other source. one you may not too familiar with.
one i may try,cause im desperate to see what kind of miracles can be perfomed on me,to rediscover.
at least it sounds like a decent plan right now.


is texas safer than florida?
those undesirable types...surely now they will come out of the woodwork for you knowing youre back on your own and that your miserable failure of a fiance sent you back in only 90 days time.  should you decide to recreate the past....places like Bennigans (the amandas,taras and vanessa are there...with new names and faces),Ridgmar Movie Tavern (maybe its time you give Animal a second chance...and i guess my worst nightmare has come true....no fiance means Leah and Animal can have you as much as they want...perhaps together or trading off....youre so much above those days and alot better than that,im just revealing some of my worst fears again) Angie and Star and Gwen...people i know very little about...im sure they have their own crap to deal with now...
but they can easily come back into your life at time of need like now....Katy in OK...Krystle and her new child.Chaddie and Zach.

its not like youre without options.
i just wish things here would gone differenly from the beginning.
we didnt learn from our AMLI fiasco...maybe living together before we were married wasnt the best plan.
cheaper...but in long run. not by any means. we lasted 10 months.
as with The Fifth Season. same lack of privacy issues. i prefer my own space. you allow me it. i dont stay in the bathroom for hours to avoid you or not come home right away for any other reason than i am a bit of a loner who can only think straight when i am without distraction. seldom can i do 2 things at once. maybe have tv on while on the computer...or music. but other that that....its hard for me to focus.
and it was you i should of been focusing on clearly...blatantly obvious now that its too late.
life has these little valuable tidbits it throws at you when its far too late and youve already fucked up beyond repair.
now i can go to the grave a sad,lonely little man with knowledge of relationships i didnt have before.
only not ever able to put them to use again.
the only way i could see us together would be after everyone in our families had died before us. this way no one would be around to second guess or rain on our parade with any plans.
lack of planning on our part.
we fucked up.
i fucked up.
we both fucked up in many ways.
damn...my judgement until now was beyond clouded...it was tarnished by outside sources of tempation for my feeble bored fucking mind.
the computer brought us together...and eventually tore us apart at the seems.
MYSPACE.
your biggest fear became somewhat of a reality as you discovered ,straight from the (w)horses mouth,that i had tried to seduce your sister as i have heard referred to as.
it was another poor attempt at teaching someone a valuable lesson when my overzealous ass should have minded my own god damn business by cant leave well enough alone. i had to intervene and comment on pictures i found to be objectionable...in what supposed to have been considered tasteful and artful.
my mistake.
i guess after seeing the SAW movies...i have alot to learn about making people appreciate their lives and start living for today.

not to say i told you so....but somehow we both knew this was doomed from the start and this florida experiment was not meant to last.

i suppose we're even now? all debts considered forgiven.
things i would like to discuss....cannot at this moment in time.
without me  i suppose it must seem to be.
i dread knowing what those around you must be whispering in your ear.
they cant offer advice...but not on anything they can even come close to knowing about.

this was OUR life. our love. our experience. our mistakes that hopefully we will both learn from.
better people can made from horrible events.

overcome obstacles set before you  in life. they will make you better,stronger...( yes even....fitter,happier,more productive.)

its not about being physically strong enough in this instance.
its all mental and emotional strain. anguish.torture almost.
i have long considered myself in some way a glutton for punishment.

i can only take so much.
i wish to live in pain no more.
throwing in the towel.
on what exactly that entails...remains to be seen.




is there a reason for everything that happens?
i have yet to figure out any possible outcome that can be seen in a positive light.

my worst fear is being completely out of the loop of the whereabouts and well being ( surely...regardless of any circumstances....i did care...i do care....i have to care....how could i not? this is heart wrenching and brain twisting....)

i am unable to express in so many words just how much at a loss i am right now in life.
without a steady income right now...i would surely crumble into a state of no repair.
a point of no return.
my crappy job has become my saving grace.
that...and the only other female i have neglected for sometime  now who i shall be getting reaquainted with.
my mother and my mothers aptly named dog,Sunshine...who someone always does manage to make you happy when skies are grey.


i cannot discuss details....of any further legalities of this matter and more than i have.

i just hope....and maybe even pray...seeing as He has been known to be there for those who need His guiding hand at times of need...and i need all the help i can get right now to assure the safety and well being of who i have come to realize ,in the most unfairly of ways, was my absolute other half...without doubt...without a shred of uncertainty.

i was taught a lesson in humility and of the age old ""dont know what ya got til its gone"" saying....

i am permantely scarred.
forever changed.
it will take time and more lessons to be learned to eventually become the person..and the man i aspire to be
if in fact i am driven to be all that i can be....so be it as well.
hopefully if i die for a cause...it will be a right just cause and not some bogus fabricated hidden agenda.

eye for an eye,tooth for a tooth,ashes to ashes,dust to dust
i will miss you to extents beyond a level any human cranial capacity could ever comprehend.
i miss you already.
i will never be the same. forever.
never.
ever.
my chest hurts and my arms shake as i feel that dreaded chill as if something bad is going to happen at any time.

i wish i could say ill be seeing you....
i can only hope you would not look back at me with the same hatred we have building inside of ourselves over the past few weeks.
i cant explain my actions.
only deeply regret them.
how much of a lesson do i need to be taught.
if only you or i  knew and understood the ramifications of what were to happen following that fateful evening,i easily would of made my way back home and if not fallen asleep,then lied in bed with at least the knowledge you were safe and sound as from now on...i will be left in the dark.

i dont wanna be without knowing how you are.
if you care to know how i am getting along....you will always have access to such information.

i dont wanna lose the most valauble thing i ever discovered in my life...besides my own life.
that is the life of you. your health . your well being.
its not all physical attraction.
you werent by any chance in another one of your monthly visitors were you?
even though technically you werent able to have them...your body and mind still went through some kind of transformation,did they not?
i never fully understood just what the Depo shots exactly were doing to you.
ignorance on my part.

what else can be said.
this is a fucking novel.
this is my release of pent up emotions bottled up for days now.
i just want to see you before you leave.
i cant always get what i want despite whatever i may think.

at the start of today,i had almost been persuaded until later reflection made me realize it was a lawyer of all people talking me out of having anything to do with you for the rest of my days.
the worst part of it....scariest part to me....was that what he was saying was making perfect sense to me, at the time.
anyone that would call the police on me rather than choose to communicate with me did not care for my well being before we ever got into any altercation.
you never would of put me through that mental anguish...that hell i endured in trying to just know what room you were in.
i tried the front office....all i got was a no vacancy sign with no one in sight.
i contemplated knocking on the door you were parked in front of.
my 100 mph brain was thinking that was too easy an assumption...that you had parked there but were staying in a room nowhere near to ensure your privacy (not your safety...i have no reason to believe you should have been fearing your safety just for moving out without telling me.) 
if i had even received a text message saying im staying at the knights inn...please dont come and find me...i could have easily rested with that knowledge.

now onto other matter....the numbers you found in my phone. i'd like to know why you have had such suspicions all along of me . regardless of when i come home,or what i tell you. you still never learned to just trust that i was out cause i preferred to not come right home. weird,yes. as weird as anything else i would do. (2 hour toilet sitting anyone? wet dreams,jerking off while you laid naked right next to me. )  
i dont know what the fuck made me so turned off by you as you think me to have been...i dont think i was...i just learned that it was not a lack of attraction to you...it was an overall out of shape laziness on my part...hoestly and truly this is what i have discovered...with all aching feet issues and the recent development of a hemorroid not to mention the 4 or 5 shits a day i was taking...it was hard to feel sexy even if you wanted me still....please read my words carefully and try to make some sense of all this. the only thing i wish for is you to have some kind of understanding as to my logic or way of thinking these past weeks)

this will have to explained at some other time when i feeling up to it. right now its 6 am and i am anticipating waking up and going to work here on Friday as i have missed 2 days so far this week.and Nathan has been out as well.
i am not sure if i should be ending this by saying i love you....but i suppose its appropriate if i say i care about immensely and if i never get to see you or speak to again...i wanted you to at least have something. you have no idea how much i think the way what we helped build together for 2 years suddenly collapsed in all around us. we groomed and trained each other to our liking...and now to think someone else can come along and fuck it all up.
are you looking forward to starting over? a new golden opportunity awaits you...

i damn sure am dreading the thought honestly...believe me having a woman touch me now..if ever...is not at the top of my list of priorites...even having my mother grab me or try to hug me....awkward to say the least. at first i thought well maybe finally we will get what we may have wanted...freedom? (on a side note...i know a definite  turning point was after that comment i made saying ""throw the gillian down the well...so canoli can be free"" but dude...that seriously was not to make you upset or worried over that becoming a reality. for quite some time i have separated fantasy from reality and by making the comments i made to not only Mary but also Alexis...it tore down sort of barrier in your mind. and maybe in mine.
but the important thing as i have said many time...is as long as i dont act on those fantasies...they are harmless thoughts to have.
you now have a better understaning of the male way of thinking..its not always our brains that think for us.
which is why,you wont becoming with any males from now on if i remember what you said of i ever were to break your heart.
just know,my dear....no ones heart hurts worse than mine....having realized what the fuck i did once i sobered up and realized i was in jail.
and this time in inmate uniform...in a cold dark damp cell. the one i successfully managed to avoid my last time around.
this time it took longer cause the bond was way higher...and i was much more leaning toward suicide as i informed the medical personnel who evaluated me...i must have pretty convining cause they made me promise i wasnt gonna hurt myself in order to be released...as well as the condition of release prohibiting me from contacting you.

god damn it Gillian...i dont know what else to say....not that i havent said a fucking lifetime full here,...but just,i cant find a way to explain enough to you here. and i cant think of a way to wrap this up.

fuck will my life ever be the same?
are you able to just up and leave? is it gonna that easy for you to do considering the events that unfolded.
so much i was looking forward to believe it or not for us.
i need to someone to have around to tell unimportant shit to.
christ you became what i had in Charlie not too long ago. you and i could discuss wrestling...he hasnt even been watching.
i made you everything i wanted in a woman...then got bored with you and literally discarded you and threw you away,.
why the fuck would a reasonably sane mind do such a thing

for that i have no fucking idea.
if anything...i just wish,not for anything unrealistic...but to just start with what can i do...we do....to get beyond this point.
where do we go from here? we went our separate ways.
i guess the rest is up to you.
what now?

sincerely yours,
Brian"

<b> Melee-Routines </b>
Get up you lazy slob, the day is almost gone 
You've lost another one the hours ramble on 
And this song won't write itself , don't imagine tat it will 
What you have to offer is standing still 

And he's wasting all of his life 
On routines that lead to nowhere(3x) 

Get up you lazy slob, the sun is almost gone 
As your shadows cast you down, you wished that I was wrong 
There will be another chance don't let this slide on by 
You can't prove them wrong unless you try 

And he's wasting all of his life 
On routines that lead to nowhere(3x) 

Yeah... 
And he's wasting all of his life 
On routines that lead to nowhere(2) 

I don't want to waste my life (4x) 

<b>WEEZER - Slob </b>
Leave me alone,
I won't pick up the phone,
And I won't listen to messages
Sent by someone who calls up and says

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife.
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream,
Don't you be a slob.

Leave me again
Don't hang out in my den,
Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of grand-daddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife.
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream,
Don't you be a slob, slob, slob.

Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of grand-daddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife.
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream,
Don't you be a slob, slob, slob...

<b>Sublime-Burritos</b> (1996)


 I don't wanna go and party, 
 I don't wanna shoot the pier, 
 I don't wanna take the doggie for a walk, 
 I don't wanna look at naked chicks and drink beer, 
 I don't wanna do a bong load, and go and wrench on the car, 
 I don't wanna hose the dog shit down, 
 cause I aint even gonna get out of bed, 

 I aint gettin, 
 I aint gettin out of bed today, 
 I aint gettin, 
 I aint gettin out of bed today, 

 Keep on skankin' ronnie, 
 skank the night away, 
 But the time is coming, 
 for us all to pay.

 I don't wanna watch no porno, 
 I don't wanna play guitar, 
 I don't wanna spank the monkey, 
 I don't wanna go down to the corner bar, 
 and I aint even got to listen to all 
 the stupid shit you got to say. 
 I don't wanna do a god damn thing. 
 I don't want to, 
 want to leave my bed today

 I don't wanna eat burritos, 
 or read about OJ. 
 No I dont want to get a head rush 
 cause I aint gettin out of bed today 
 I aint got to leave my bed

 Keep on skankin' ronnie, 
 skank the night away, 
 But the time is coming, 
 for us all to pay


hmm is he trying tell us something? a desperate plea for attention? a desperate cry for recognition?
or is this just a reminder to himself?!?!?
you decide."

Birds sing there's not a cloud in the sky August 8th
I see a bunch of hippies crying yeah August 8th is a beautiful day
Like waking up from a real bad dream suddenly everything is ok 
The storm has passed the sun is shining yeah August 8th is a beautiful day
What's goin on what's goin on is something bummin your scene 
There's something wrong there's something wrong I'm not trying to be mean 
The air is sweet the summer flowers bloomin nowhere in that is anything grey
Feelings of joy are filling the street yeah beautiful day 
Like waking up from a fucked up dream suddenly everythings looking good 
There's been no permanent damage done
Yeah August 8th came right when it should
Poor Jeff 
Poor little 
Timmy turtle 
Staying home on such a beautiful day

Space command to Zoom
All systems are go for your message to Canoli!

Hey, Canoli!
It's your birthday!
I'm in charge of the stars 
And I'm here to say, 
'cause Canoli, 
You're the BIG STAR today! 

My name is Zoom 
And I live on the moon 
But I came down to earth 
Just to sing you this tune
Hey, Canoli, 
It's your birthday today! 

A present for you
I wanted to find
An outerspace creature
A one of a kind! 
A wild whop or a kukelchoo,
An apple drop or a buzzardstew
Or maybe a 3-eyed pickleshay
For your birthday

Did you ask:
""uh, what's a kukelchoo?""
Well, up on the moon it's nothing new
But that won't do for you,
On your birthday!

I searched behind the clouds and stars
I even zoomed my bike to Mars
And met my friend the saucer man 
And he said: 
Hey Zoom, you're in need of something new
So how about a song, just from YOU?

And so tonight when you're in bed
I'll be singing to you as I zoom overhead
Singing, Canoli! Happy Birthday
Singing, Canoli! Happy Birthday
Singing, Canoli! Happy Birthday 

To you! 

Happy Birthday, Canoli! 
See you next year! 


365 days x 24 years =8,760 days...damn i'm old

weeee and in 14 days ...i'm a new man!"

"event","i havent said the pledge since ....a long time ago in school.doesnt affect me.
but i was young..impressionable...not really able to think for myself too much.
i was told all my life and led to believe all holidays were associated with fictional character.
christmas..the birth of jesus was overshadowed by a fat man in a red suit. who brought me toys.ahhh.
easter i was brought candy by a giant friggin bunny,(same drugs the people who created smurfs were on....abnd possibly blue men..hee hee)
when i lost a tooth..i got a dollar from a fairy....fair deal!
and in school....a place where we are groomed and raised to be independent thinkers and eventually young adults...then adults later on. yeah right.
we all think the same. we all act the same.
or anarchy and choas ensues.
my point....let the kids think what they want. when they say the pledge in school..say it as we all have always know so as not to raise an uproar ....wouldnt want that.
freedom of speech is nice. great.much appreciated.
having all these religions split this country in fractions and numerous fundamental know it alls defeats the purpose of freedom of speech and choice.
i can no longer watch hwat i want to or hear a radio program for fear of ""if the kids might hear it""
wouldnt want them to know how childish we become as adults do we....hey kids...it never gets better.
look forward to growing up and watching movies about space(star wars) and dragons and computers and even cartoons.fantasy rules the land,reality sucks.
yes adults watch cartoons. its called anime. doesnt change the fact its a damn cartoon.
wanna know whats really best for your children....let them think for themselves....maybe someday when they reach the age of reason..15 for me...youll learn some people like what they like and youll never change it.its best not to tell people what to do. 
im all for freedom to live and let live.
under god...in god we trust....if you say so.
just leave me alone. this doesnt affect me.
jesus hasnt shown me any signs of needing to be in my life.but hes saved many many MANY lost wandering souls from the fiery pits of hell and eternal damnation...given them reason to live in times of need.
we all need someone or something to turn to in times of need. i personally have no need! so do waht ya like.,
and let me do the same.
my stance....keep it in the pledge.
if they take it out i wont be offended....but i fear what the rest of this country will do in reaction. 
think about the kids....its all about the kids,
who cares.
and shut up already. enjoy life. listen to blue man group. go outside. get off the computer.do what you do.
just please for the sake of humanity and sanity of us all...dont have anymore kids...we have enough cretinous plebians on this miserable planet already. enough with the babies.
let it all end.
thank you....i was bored.

i can see she is happy.
possibly happier? more than before?
it doesnt seem to be going away. 
i keep insisting she will get sick of me.
and just as i figured such was becoming reality,i was wrong.
we fooled outselves.
now we are both equally happy.
happier than weve been in quite a while.
ok so its only been a week.
but a long week at that.
and at the end of it we areas happy and sickeningly bubbly as we were when it all began. in florida.on a monday
now its wednesday of  the next week. st patricks day. 
she is happy. (when not at work and with me...even while driviing she smiles!! yyyyeeeech heh i kid..no she really does smile but i kid about the yech part)
therefore i am happy
all is fucking well god damn it.
peachy frickin keen.
yes really.
and we are fully aware how gay and lame and optimistic and positive and happy we are around each other so we are in no danger of being blinded by love. we are mutual stalkers. she is my woman. ugh *grunts and beats chest* i...her....man..*growls*

by weeks end i wont be able to stop smiling and/or laughing at the time i had and possible best experience of this or any other year.

or there could be the always possible usual mood of ""fuck the world"" as ill be left alone by friday and slapped in the face by the cruel hand of reality as now i will have to start the dreaded job hunt/ working my ass off to pay off any bills/ car maintenance/musical equipment/get my ass outta here fund.

man a car,a girl,now about that life i been desperately looking for, waiting for...a real one! a good one! heres to hoping.

6000 bux still in the bank since june. damn thats not too bad. a record for having money this long in the bank by far. tax return coming soon and shocked to discover i made more in 4 months  ""work"" than any other year..even a full years pay. the devil has truly blessed me.

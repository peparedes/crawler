"event","ok im severely pissed off and for no particular reason. nothing seems any good any more. i have little motivation for anything. i have some major issues going on and i appear to be insecure and some kinda of commitment phobia. im have anger build up inside and no way of letting it out. i regret university what it was perceived to be it isnt and now that most of my uni friends have left and moved on i seem to just have a select group of about four people who i really see as friends and not mere acquaintances. in a way i am sitting in a pond of self pity. i could just be freaking out for no good reason but to be honest i think ive just had a wake up call to whats really going on. i wish there was someone to talk truly with but then i dont like to talk about myself and no one has a clue what goes on in my head anyway so no one suspects anything is wrong and even when they do they just think im being moody and that pisses me off more then anything."

Is it really too much to ask to just be able to sleep. i have a reserve plan for tonight though. if i cant get to sleep im just going to get slaughtered on vodka and pass out. this may not be the best course of action but im pretty sure it will work."

In fact the more i think about it the more likely it seems that shes avoiding me because i hurt her. she tells me personal things and yet as soon as she asks me whats up i just tell her i dont want to talk about it. that ain't fair on her really. i really wish i understood myself sometimes. i like to think im good to others but in reality it seems quite the opposite."

"event","ok initially this is going to be a pointless journal cos no-one knows its here. why have i started it? i dont really know, maybe just a way to write things down, maybe boredom, maybe self pity. i feel crap i dont know if i want to be alive or not. sound reasoning for this. no maybe from the outside my life doesnt look so bad. but for me i feel like im down a dead end road. the sh*t is going to hit the fan sometime. maybe i should sort things so it doesnt, maybe i cant stop, and maybe, in fact more like certainly its my own fault. maybe i left things to late, maybe i am sorting things but not recognizing it. Its a whole lot of maybe's but that kinda says it all about where i am at the moment, i dont know whats wrong or what to do about. im confused and as soon as i think i know whats wrong it no longer makes sense. the thing is i have a friend who also uses this site and often she is in a bad way and i help in any way i can, and to be honest she does the same for me, but i wont tell her whats going on because i like her and it would kinda seem shallow, as if i was stealing her thunder or looking for attention. To most this will seem like a mad ramble and it probably is, but also its an insight into my mind."

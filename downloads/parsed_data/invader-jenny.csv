The possibility of life on Europa and junk.  Damn it.  I don't know why I screwed up.  I guess I was trying to be too professional and I just ended up skipping points and I paused too often.  Damn it.  Oh well.  If I get a B I am happy.  A couple of people rated me pretty high, but the girl next to me didn't rate me so high.  Damn."

"event","This is the second night in a row that I have dreamed that aliens have attacked earth.  Last night was like 100% like War of the Worlds (movie version).  From the odd clouds and the lightning to the invading tripods.  Apparently my mother was killed, but I was able to find my brother and father.  It was spooky because I knew what was going on because I had seen the movie.  But in my dream it was real life, and it was happening for real this time.

The night before my dream was about the same thing (aliens from War of the Worlds invading) but it was more like a sequel since they were impervious to bacteria and they were actually eating us.  Weird.  Two nights in a row.  I guess I should lay off the Sci-Fi movies and H.G. Wells books.  Nah."

"event","I had the gayest dream last night.  Something about a sequel to the movie ""War of the Worlds"" but it was in real life.  Like the story of War of the Worlds was real and we all lived through it, and then they came back again but it was so lame that we all thought that this could be bad enough to be a crappy Hollywood sequel.  The aliens were bigger and were actually eating people and not just using their blood.  Plus there was a flood and I rescued a family from a car underwater.  It was crazy man.  Crazy."

If you havent' seen Batman Begins, go see it now.  It's the best batman movie ever made.  100X better than the other crappy 4 batman movies that have been pumped out for the past 20 years."

Myself I am not worried about.  It's my cats.  This is a new house and my aunt has another cat, but he is a outdoor cat and with claws I might add.  He is nice, but to other cats in his own home...I donno."

Holy crap!  People you need to go see War of the Worlds!  It is so damn good!  Well, it's pretty good.  It's way better than the original and is more closely related to the book.  The book is good, but I gotta be honost with ya'.  The book is a bit boring.  It reads more like a first hand account documentary.  But it's still good.

But the Speilberg movie is awesome.  I haven't been that scared since...oh since I can remember.  And it is not like *bam!* something on screen jumps at you.  It's scary because it is believeable and it keeps you right there in the action.  We all know what happens in the end.  We've all grown up with the H.G. Wells book, but still.  It's good.  Very good.  I'm gonna go see it again tomorrow after class.  I was actually shaking during the first half of the movie.  I thought I was just cold, but that wasn't it.  And the alien tripod are badass, man.  Oh those things are so damn cool.

I've gotten kicked out of my house since they are redoing the bathroom, so I get to live with my other aunt for a week.  Joy.  Well, it is only one week and then I get to come back to a toilet that actually flushes.  Won't that be a treat.

And it is very hot here.  Like 92 degrees.  Make the heat go away."

"event","When you stay up till 1 am watching 1950's Sci-Fi B- movies:  You have a normal day.
Yeah I watched most of ""Forbiden Planet"" and the end of ""The Thing.""  I gotta say.  I really enjoyed ""The Thing.""  But what I really want to do is get a hold of the DVD of ""This Island Earth.""  That movie is so bad that it's good.  I'm gonna re-make it you know.  I may not be the best directer that will ever hit Hollywood, but by God, I'm gonna re-make that movie like Speilberg re-made ""War of the Worlds"" (which I plan on seeing this weekend).  I've wanted to re-make ""This Island Earth"" for like years.  It's got a great plot, it's just that the costumes and the acting and the graphics and the music is so lame.  I bet I could supe it up and make it a really winner.  What's more awesome than a story about aliens who need help from earth and just when the aliens get the information that they need to survive they decided that humans are too dangerous to be left alive and decided to wipe us all out, but in the end they are destroyed?  Bitchin'.
Add some wonderful LucasFilm graphics, good actors, tweek the screenplay, get John William or James Horner to do the music, get Dreamworks to produce my movie, BAM! excellent movie.

I'm gonna do this people.  I'm gonna direct this movie and it's gonna be an awesome movie.  I don't care if it is #1 or #20 in the box office.  I just want to make it.  And it will be a billion times better than any crappy Adam Sandler movie that idiot can fart out."

"event","<P>Check out my birthday present. I lost my birthstone ring that I got when I was 16 at work last spring. I was sad, but it was kind of a good thing maybe. Because now I get a new one this year and I get to decide what it looks like and have it actually fit me. I'm a size 5 (the smallest size before you have to custom fit everything) and it is silver instead of gold. I'm not a big fan of gold unless it is Saudi gold. I have some peices from Saudi Arabia that I love. Anyway, I'm deciding between this ring from Helzberg and another from Zales. The one from Zales I'd have to order out of a book and it is a bit more expensive. And I think I like the Helzberg one more because it is exactly what I want. Princess cut, silver band, diamond position. The other one was nice too, but it was designed to be 2 toned and since I want it in silver only, I think I like the other one.</P>

"event","But I don't know why.

God, I have been so moody lately.  I hate it.  My whole body is so messed up.  I've been mostly depressed for the past few days and I just can't seem to get happy.
My belly has been cramping like my period is about to start, but it's been doing that for 4 days now and I haven't started yet.  I've put on some weight and I've been feeling nauseous all the time.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say I was pregnant.  Of course, that's impossible since I'm a virgin.  But man I don't feel so hot right now.

I know I shouldn't be so depressed, but I'm prone to it quite often.  I have a great life and a good future, but man, I do wish that I was happier or something.  I guess I'm just a little bit lonely.  And I have been wishing I had a kid for like months now.  Every time a see a little kid I'm like ""Damn, I wish I had one of those.""  Of course that kid would have a horrible life because I don't even have a degree yet.  How can I take care of a kid when I can't even take care of myself?  Some day, yes I hope to have a child (I wish I was popping them out right now) but I can't take care of a kid right now.

It's not easy being lonely.  Many of you (who might be reading this) know this feeling.  I just hope it passes.  I'm tired of feeling like this.  I should be happier or something.  What I need is to go someplace nice and exotic with a few friends and just chill.  Whether on the beach or some lake mountain, I don't care (well, actually I want to be some place tropical) and just lay there and be happy in the sun.  Away from Michigan, away from my office job, away from my aunt and extended family, away from it all."

"event","Boy what a waste of time this is.  I've been sitting here for like 4 hours doing just about jack shit.  Not that I mind not doing anything, but I really can't go anywhere and the speakers on this computer don't work so I'm left with no music.

I was looking up star wars stuff and I found some really cute baby cloths that have classic SW stuff all over them.  And it got me thinking.  I really want kids.  I mean, I've always wanted kids and I wish I was popping them out right now, but I can't wait to have them.  Of course with an attituded like that I'll probably find out I'm infertile or something (we do live in an age of irony after all).  But I mean, I was even looking up baby names again.  I know for sure that my daughter's first name will be Hope, but other than that my kids could be named anything.

I guess what I wish is that I was done with school, I have my bachelors degree framed on my wall, I'm married (that's the main dream), I'm just about done with my masters degree, and I'm a couple months pregnant with my first child.
That's where I wish I was in life right now.  So I guess I wish I was living the summer of 2008 insteand of 2005."

"event","I'm not sure, but I'm in a really good mood.  Which you would think is odd considering that I have to work from 8 to 5 today in place of Emily who is camping.  But I am.  I am in a really good mood.

We had some guests over yesterday.  A guy my aunt is friends with and his wife and son.  The son's name is Mike and he is adorable. He's 5 years younger than me (he 16 and me 21) and he is one bright kid.  I mean if you are reading Stephen Hawking's ""A brief history of time"" for fun, you are a smart kid.  And yes, I too have read the book.  Mike is really into sci-fi and quite the introvert so we had much to talk about...when we were actually talking.  He actually brought his lightsaber with him.  How neat is that?  And he stayed up all night watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force downstairs.
What a sweet kid (and adorable too).  If he were actually living in the area I would totally hang out with him.  Neat, neat kid.  I liked 'em.

And we had a big storm go through yesterday morning so the rain helped green things up, and today has been the first day in the break of the heat wave.  It's gonna be nice today (possible mid 80's) and the sun is out and about.

I also met with my advisor yesterday and we figured out what we need to do to make sure my 9 hours of elective credits are taken care of.  My handbook says that I only need 6 but my online thing says that I need 9 so I'll go with my online thing.  I've already got 6 hours out of the way, and I have one class reamaining (3 credits) and I'm deciding between 16mm Film class and Animation I.  I don't know which one to take.  I'll probably just take both."

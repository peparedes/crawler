"event","I almost finished playing (PS2) Natsuzora no Monologue.  I saw all the endings, but not all the CGs.  I guess my favorite is the Sawanoi Sousuke route.  He is a leader (buchou) of science club and also a real genius who's very good-looking and sensitive, however, most of the people around him think he's a mad scientist. XD  Usually he acts like that, and it was so funny.  Buchou's seiyuu is Takahashi Shin'ya.  At first I thought I had never heard his voice, but he's been playing a role of Murasako Masao in TV anime <i>Shiki</i>. (-_-;)  A little timid weirdo. :p  

I really enjoyed the game of this time-loop story.  Whenever you restart the game after one ending, there'll be new discoveries and you will never get bored until you finish all the endings.  Well, I believed that the main girl (player) is a very sweet gentle student, but it was wrong.  Sometimes she was kinda selfish and aggressive.  It was the only point in the game I didn't like very much.

The game I play next will be (PS2) S.Y.K Renshouden.  I really look forward to Suwabe-san's voice again.  Gokuu~ ^^ *heart*

I have been playing (NDS) Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side 3 and (PS2) Natsuzora no Monologue recently.  Oh, my gosh, I love Suwabe-san's character Sakurai Kouichi on GS3. XDDD  I mean, I love both of Sakurai brothers (Suwabe-san + Sugita-san).  It's a very cool system that the characters can call the player's setting name.  Wonderful KONAMI!!

Also, I have been really enjoying playing Natsuzora.  I've read some comments on the product page of Amazon.jp and got to know it's the game that makes you cry.  I love that type of stories.  I saw one ending with Kinose-kun (CV: Abe Atsushi) so far, and of course I cried. (;_;)  I'm looking forward to seeing Asanami-sensei ending (CV: Inoue Kazuhiko) now, or maybe Sawanoi-buchou (CV: Takahashi Shinya).  Back to play the game now. :p"

I was given, by Marc Davis:

1. freckles (sorry! but they're cute)
2. jay-z
3. waldenbooks
4. champagne
5. double s

1. I have freckles. I hate them. I have a huge one on my nose that I'm really self-conscious about because when I first meet people they ALWAYS say ""oh, you have something on your nose."" I guess it looks like dirt.

2. I love Jay-Z. A lot. I wish I was Beyonce so I could have her jamming booty, and also be married to Jay-Z.

3. WaldenBooks is where I work. I love books, and I love my job. 

4. If I could only drink one thing for the rest of my life, it would be champagne. I keep it classy.

5. I'm a nazi. LOL."

The day before the last Harry Potter is released (Thursday) I work an eight hour shift, which is not bad at all, until you consider the fact that working in a bookstore is quite possibly the most slow/boring job ever!
The day the last Harry Potter book is released (Friday) I work 1:30 in the afternoon until 1:30ish in the morning! And I say 1:30ish in the morning because we are going to stay open until all the people who come to the release party and reserved a book get their book. 12 hours atleast! So lame. 
Please, please, please come to the release party and keep me company!
Then the next day (Saturday) I have another eight hour shift! 

Thank you, Walden Books.


Oh, and I also have to dress up as Sybill Trelawney. I haven't seen her in the movies/read about her in the books, but I know they're going to make me walk around and read palms, and do the sorting hat. Ugh.
Google her, look at her picture. I.N.T.E.N.S.E.

My dad has something like $20,000 in child support that he never paid, and my mom and the state still want him to pay.
So I have my dad sucking up to me, trying to get me to convince my mom to waive all of that money, and my mom up my ass about how big of a piece of shit he is ALL THE TIME.

Anyway, for graduation my dad gave me a check for some money, and my mom in turn took his account and routing numbers off of the check and had his bank account frozen since he hasn't been paying child support.

Now the check has come out of my bank account, making me have insane overdraft charges to the tune of $330.

I'm so behind.

I decided though that I'm going to take some time off of school to work and save and decide some things.
I plan to go to school Spring 2008.
As for what school, I decided I'm applying to UGA (in Athens!), UCF, and FGCU.
Those are my official 'choice schools' as of yet, in that order.

So, basically everyone is done with their work and I am not, at all. I still have a but load to do. It suck ass.

I hate math. I really really don't get it. I spent 5 hours today with my dad trying to understand corelation and I still don't understand it very well. Honestly I hear math things and I seriously CANNOT comprehend it. I'm as dumb as a rock.

Which is pretty dumb.

I also hate math because it makes me fat. See I end up eating pounds of candy because I'm so stressed out over maybe not being able to gateway if I can't comprehend some stupid little math thing and then I get fat and can't exersice because I have no time and I'm too tierd and stress.

First of all I get to ride the T in by my self which is actually really fun, except on the way home when there are like one bazillon people on the T and your personal bubble become the size of a pea.

Everyone in my class is really nice. I've realised what a bubble I live in. The people in my class are really diverse. Even the teachers are crazy, one of them talks half the time in english and half the time in spanish and the other one is this crazy flamboiant guy, who looks exactly like the hott dude from the ART. Anyway, not to not mention all the college kids from Mass Art who run about. It is like a breath of fresh air. 

So we are making 2 outfits one from scratch and one form garments that we got at the Garment District. My outfit from scrach is kinda of like that super hott green flapper dress that, that really hott dancer wears in Singing in the Rain. I haven't started that one yet but it is going to be dripping in rinestones and glitter. and then my other outfit is hard to explain but it still very sweet none the less.

You guys have to come see my fasion show, it's on Friday at Mass Art from 5:30 - 6:30 I will be modeling my stuff! XD"

Today was pretty good. I got all caught up with school, and got a Meets on my spanish reading assesment, which was really nice. However I  still have to revise that AH reading assesment so it is not an incomplete. Heh. Play pratice was pretty good, got to talk about Antigone. 

Eric, Holly and I went to see Antigone yesterday, at the Ex. It was differnt. The text was very modern, and the chorus was kinda random. Also the characters were interpreted in a differnt way, a more modern way I guess. The set was bangin' though. It was covered in negatives that light up.

Tomarrow I'm seeing Measure for Measure somewhere in Boston. It's being put on by an awsome company. I hope it is better than when I saw it at the Globe, which was horrid. Bad Times.
 
Sat. I'm seeing the Littleton show and some crazy dance thing at Sanders Theatre.

Aw man I'm so not going to have any time to do homework. I have SO much due:

-All 10 pages of notes from 5 sources for Monday
-Science problem for Tues.
-2 essays and 50 lines of poetry in spanish for Monday

I'm cool with going and seeing it again. Actually I'm excited because we had seats 3 rows form the back and when I go with my mom we have seats one or two rows from the front. My enjoyment of theatre is severly damped when I don't get to see the actor's faces. So yes, Dido was good, especially cupid who pranced and was generally awsome and Hermes who was painted (or something) all gold. 

We also got to hang around Harvard Square for a while which is always good, even if UO and Hootenany are really really expensive. Seriously though, the priced of everything were way un-fair.

That probably doesn't mean anything to you guys, but trust me it is wicked harXcore. 

So then I went to play pratice afterwards and thought I was going to get feed, however I was not, which kinda made me sad, but that was okay because I wasn't really very hungry anyway. Only Gale, Jake and I were the only ones there form scene 15, so we couldn't block it. I was looking forward to that. I guess we will do it tomarrow. So I basically sat there watching the chorus, chorucize which was interesting/ learning lines, I totally have my first monologue down. The Ode looks really awsome actually. Oh and I observed Gale and Jake whilst they were dinosaurs.

After play pratice I went to the gym, and worked out for 45 minutes, which made me feel oh so much better. What can I say I'm and endorphen junkie.

I was going to go over to Eric's house, but then I couldn't get a ride unless I got there at 5 and apperntly Eric was to busy with other things then.

So after I got home from school I went to DI and we might be somewhat done for regionals. I better make this quick and get back to the mural before the team kills me. 

But first: 

When I got home from DI my dad showed me this satilite radio that he got.It's really cute looking becasue it is wooden and small and very pretty. So I look at the channels that it gets and see channels for 80's music and hair bands, trance, but loads of classical and verything in between, but then I see a channel that is ALL BROADWAY ALL THE TIME. 

So basically for the time I got home which was like 9pm to 12 I sat in front of that radio doing homework and reading Antigone. It is offically my new best friend, actually the dude who announces the songs is my best friend because he basically is like *omg wasn't that song FABULOUS?!*

Plan for making like more intersting:

1. Be more social, as in actually calling people to do thing. (this will be so much easier when Megan has a car, I need more Megan.)

2. Become a model. XD I'm so going to do it. I promise.

So being in school for over 24 hours was an experience in it's self not to not mentiont he fact that there was no food involved. Okay here is how it all went down (in order of events)

-After school the advisory heads down to room 19 which was one of our homebases. We could money for a good hour, and I find out that I have no money counting skills.
-We then proceed to play DDR/ violent video games. 
-Andy's fiance comes over to stay with us. His name is also Andy. I found it very amusing that it looked like Andy could squish him, he was a short skinny spencer like kinda of guy. I don't think he liked us much.
-The female portion of the advisory watches A Chours Line, Andy is freaked out by some of it. Meanwhile the other half of our advisory plays more video games. The ganitor dude coems in a for a little while to watch the movie. He stays there for a long time, and just kind of dumps around. 
-It is now like 8 pm, so we head down to the gym to get mats to sleep on. While doing so we engadge in a giant mat fight.
-In the auditorium we make forts with mats. Alex, Kristen, and I sit on Andy who was rolled up in a mat.
-We play hide and seek and forget to tell Kristen that we stopped playing. We forget about it and then get confused when we can't find kristen about half and hour later.
-The school is scavened for kristen and after 20 minutes she is found behind a trash can.
-We play a super intense round of capture the flag through out the whole school. Alex falls alseep on a mat somewhere.
-At this point in time bad things are happening do to hunger. I dance on MST room tables and then Paul and I go on a mad rampage for juice. It got kind of ugly.
-Andy tells us at 11 pm it is time to sleep. We reluantley get into sleeping bags. It was kind of akward though because we didn't have enough mates for everyone to have their own so we lined them up and all shared. Kristen, Nick, Paul, Kaitlin Aril and I CANNOT sleep probably do to the honey shots that we had resorted to once the juice ran out.
-Nick trips over Kristen's suitcase and makes noise.
-Paul walks around with a sleeping bag over hsi head, which was really funny late at night when you are dying of hunger.
-We all notice that it looks as though Phill is molesting Alex in his sleep.
-None of us end up sleeping untill 2.
-Once I awake I try to be a worm. It fails.
-I get up to get dressed in the bathroom and get weired out thinking about how I am in school and it's a saturday moring.
-FINALLY at like 8:30 we get to eat. Andy wanted us to wait and break out fast together and Alex and I almost killed her. 
-We have to clean up the mess we made and then leave at 10.

Off to take a shower because I feel like nast. Then I'm goign to Alex's part-ay."

"event","I do. I went and got some CDs at strawberries. I was going to Eric the Hedwig soundtrack for his birthday but they didn't have it. They also didn't have the Taraf de Haidouks cd I wanted. Needless to say I was most pissed off. However I magically found the Robert Palmer cd I LOVE and got it because my cd is the shits and fucks up my computer majorly when I try and load it. 

So it was all good. 

I <3 late 80's slightly cheesey soft rcok that reminds me of my  childhood. I also <3 a oringal self titled B-52's CD that I found the other day. It has Rock Loster. ^.^

Today was my meeting with my mom and Andy. It  was pretty lame and basically Andy said that I needed to meet on all the next pieces. (duh) And then my mom and Andy tried to convince me that I am good at math. Apperntly Andy thinks I should be doing exceeds work and that the reason I don't is because I'm lazey (wtf?). That almost made me feel bad about my revison. ...... almost.  I hate math, it's so abstract and pointless.

So yeah it was dumpy. 

My parents are being crazy and sayin that we are going to get a condo in Cambridge for fun? It's kinda akward, but I'm not complaining. However I dout it will happen, things never happen with my family, same old story.

Off to draw a map for my op revison tomarrow. Jim is such an eXtreme assesor. I swear it is physically impossible to get a meets the first time with him."

And I KNOW exactly what I need to gateway. I hate it when people are so un-chill. It's fucking annoying. I think Andy thinks I don't know what I need to do to gateway or some shit like that. 

I just have to play their game. I really can't win. Whatever I'll just give them some bs and then do whatever. Acting time! I need to come off as more positive and less of a lazy ass.

God I can't fucking wait until I can get out of here. College please come now.

""Oh that is a really nice suit, did you get it at Salvation Army? It looks like one of the ones I donated, you know I only donate suits to the salvation army so someone less fortunate can use it for a job interview.""

I feel SO bad. That suit could have been used by some homeless man trying his hardest to get a job. I'm definatly going to give it back when I'm done, but I still feel so terrible. 

Why is the world so cruel? Is it cruel to walk by a homeless person, with out even giving them a second glance? 

In harvard square last month I think it was I saw a homless man sitting cross legged on a gruby blanket. He had on a ratty coat and he looked like a yogi from India. He was flicking seeds onto the brick and tiny birds gathered around him to eat, while the world just walked by.

At least I'm sad for once, and not just pissed off."

It kind of bothers me, but what really bothers me is the fact that Olivia and I spend like 3 hours on Sunday cleaning up the house, and now it is a total mess again. My mom just can't understand the fact that if you simpily put things awa when you finish with them the house stays clean. 

I HATE it when the house is so messy. I can't wait until I move out. Oh it is going to be so good. I think I must think that at least 10 times a day.

My research project in AH has turned into a monster. My topic is so huge. At least I'm doing it. XD

Redeamable fact about my reccent life: I found out that Taraf de Haidouks is going to be preforming in Boston!!!! BBQ!! I saw the Siringa Tree at the ART, brillant piece of theatre.

I have come to the realization that I need a new book case or something my room has books oozing out of it. And since I'm bored I'm going to count them! XD

I have 352 (I think I'm missing some) books cramed into my small room. I've read most of them too. That's a little crazy especially because half of them are in my closet and the other half are cramed into a small bookself and then various places around my room. 

Well that was mildly entertaining...."

Things that have made my mood elivate slightly: 

-Having a snow day
-Watching Project Runway
-Finishing a charcol that I have been working on for a while
-Not really having  work to do


Things that have made my mood unelivate(?):

-PERIOD!
-Hunger
-The fact that I am stuck in my room untill the cleaners leave and the book that I am reading is not in my room
-Vanessa being elmimated from Project Runway, because she was oh so british (in a good way) 

AS a side note on the topic of Project Runway, Austin is way over dramatic, I don't think he is going to last much longer because his designs are really just what he wants and they are all sort of in the same genre aka vintage poofy. I also don't think that Rob is going to last much longer either because he doesdn't really do work.

I should revise some pieces..."

For some reason Craig thought that it would be great to try and make Kyle ask me out. WTF what is wrong with everyone? I am just going to stay in my room and listen to Carmina Burana loudly and think about how much I can't wait untill college. 

In other news I have found and agency that I'm going to send head shots into and see if I can get an interview. I hope I can at least get and interview.

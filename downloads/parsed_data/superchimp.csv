"event","Hey all, feels good to finally get back into Winnipeg. Sorry for those of you whom I did not mention that I was going to Ottawa for Reading Week, it was a bit crazy last week and I didn't have the chance to talk to everyone. Plus, as I had mentioned before I really had no internet access either.

Anyways, as I had mentioned in my previous post, Ottawa was a great time. Got to see all of the sights and got to check out both the pub and bar scenes as well. I got to visit my uncle, which was incredibly fun, as he took my friends and I out for a fun night of pizza and beer. I also got to catch up with him which I haven't had the chance to do in a long time. Another major highlight was seeing an NHL Ottawa Senators game at the Corel Centre. Unfortunately the Sens lost against Florida, but it was nice to be able to see such a high level of hockey again since the Jets left Winnipeg.

Other than that, I don't recommend anyone go for a 24 hour drive unless you're really looking forward to the trip. It's always hard to picture how much driving that actually is unless you get stuck in a car for that long. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it was definately a trial on how long I could go without feeling my legs before I demanded to get out of the car. ;)

This week has many things to do, hopefully they will get done. I have to sit down now and figure out everything that is needed. Talk to you all soon!"

I toured Parliament, saw the major museums, skated the Rideau Canal, and so much else. I haven't had internet access in over a week and it's amazing how much you come to rely on it just for the little things in life, like keeping in touch with your online friends, checking your email and keeping folks updated about your life on your journal. Anyways, because it is not my account I'm on right now, this has to be short. I'll update everyone when I get back on Sunday. Everyone have a good weekend and I'll see you soon. Oh, and Christina, I miss you so much right now. *Hugs* (until I get back)."

I love those lyrics, kudos to anyone that knows what movie they're from. I can't remember being so happy for so many days straight even with midterms and papers coming up due. I did end up staying the night at Chris's again on Monday, but had to go to class Tuesday morning. Tuesday night I ended up going to medical school info session for the U of M at the downtown campus. Not really helpful, but interesting in some way I suppose. Then spent the night talking to friends online and studying for my midterm for this morning. The midterm went quite well, and now I've been spending the afternoon looking for research papers I can use for my own papers that I can read during the trip to Ottawa so I'll be prepared when I get back after next week.

Tonight, just have to study for my Recombinant DNA midterm for tomorrow. No real studying to do though, as it's an entirely problem based test that I pretty much will figure out or I won't. I just really hope that it goes well. Talking to Christina online.. I think we'll be getting together for Thursday night, and for awhile on Friday considering it is Valentine's Day. Trying to work out something nice for us, but we'll see what I end up deciding on. Well, back to more research."

"event","Well, right now I can tell this is going to be a very long post, due to the simple fact that I've had one heck of alot happen in just a few days without writing. I went to the Best Buddies social Friday night. It was a whole lot of fun. I had invited Christina to come with me. There were not a whole lot of people in the bar, but we still had a lot of fun none the less. After the social she came back to my place and we did a whole lot of talking and enjoying one another's presence. Unfortunately it also meant that I got absolutely no sleep that night, and I had to be up at 6 to go drop her off and go to work. It was quite a rough morning, and I ended up getting sick at work probably due to the exhaustion, so I came home and took a 7 hour nap. I got up briefly for supper and to do laundry, and then went to sleep again until I had to wake up in the morning for work again. That time, work went extremely well. I have never been that awake at work before, and it felt good.

Anyways, after work on the Sunday, I went over to Christina's for supper. It was a delicious stir-fry like dish with pork and a peanut sauce. I really enjoyed it, especially with some sliced almonds and some nice spicy sauce to put on top, to get it to just the right level of spicyness for me (which equals one hell of a lot of spice). After supper we curled up and watched Bourne Identity. I had seen it before, but it's still a pretty good flick. I ended up spending the night at her place, and came home this morning so that I could return some notes to Andrea and finish off a few things.

Other than that, looks like I'll be heading over to her place again so we can enjoy each other's company before I get into my two midterms this week and have to head off to Ottawa for next. Life looks so much better as of now. :)"

"event","Well, I think I feel somewhat accomplished overall today. Got all my mail away, and wrote my midterm for immunology. It didn't go as well as it probably could have, but I didn't do poorly either. It's only worth 12%, so I'm not as super worried about it as I could be. Now I have the 2 midterms next week to worry about.

After getting home, I pretty much sat around and chilled for awhile, which I really needed just to relax. Then I clicked into a cleaning mode that is difficult to shut off... I am usually a very tidy person, and I hate the filth around here most of the time. So I went nuts and cleaned everything meticulously in the hallway, kitchen and shelves, and most importantly, the bathroom, which was horrible, as you can imagine with 4 guys who use it and don't clean it. It took quite a while to get it the way I can stand. I still have the bathtub to do, but I'll get to that soon to finish up. Yay for me, because nobody else gives me cheers.

Well, it doesn't seem like I was able to get Saturday day shift off like I wanted to, unless I get a phonecall tomorrow because I left a message, but I doubt it. Oh well, even still I plan to have a good time. I also plan to perhaps skip my 2nd class tomorrow, and Andrea and I can get all of our lab work done early so I can come home and sleep for a couple of hours before the social so I can get away with only a couple of hours of sleep tomorrow night. I'll just have to moderate the booze. Dave and Tom are coming, and I asked Christina to come to, so hopefully she'll have a good time too. I have a feeling she likes the bar scene when she gets out there. ;)

Well don't feel like doing work now, so other than cleaning the tub, I'm putting my feet up for the night. And for anyone that doesn't like that... :P"

"event","So many days have gone by without anything worth mentioning.. well I guess that's not entirely true. I needed to send in my essay for my medical application for next Monday, so I sat down on Monday and wrote the whole 1,200 words or so in 45 minutes. I got Andrea to check it over, and she was highly impressed, so I think it will do. I find it really easy to write essays on why I want to become a physician due to the great amount of material I have to bring into it, including my schooling, my own medical conditions, and my work and volunteering, which all somewhat pertain to that. Oh well, it's done, and today I went to get a photo to send with it as well, as they've requested from me, so that will all be sent away tomorrow.

Curling tonight, and also have immunology quiz tomorrow morning, so I'll try and get one reading of the notes down now before curling, and then again once I get back. I have a break tomorrow, so I should be able to get some reading done again then.

Other than that.... send letter off tomorrow, as well as my grad photo order forms and cash, then I am planning to look in depth at my essays that are rapidly approaching. March seems like a long time away, but I know it's not. Plus, I need to give Chris, a guy from work, a call tomorrow to see if he can possibly switch me a shift on Saturday so that I can stay out later at the Best Buddies social on Friday. Here's to high hopes... another girl told me she could switch the day just now, but it doesn't work out anymore because of my really screwed up weekends. Oh well, I feel bad for saying no to her after I asked her, but it just doesn't work anymore... dumb scheduling."

"event","Well, today was crazy busy. I was up by about 10:30, but had to do two chapters of reading for my adolescent development course, plus my assignment. These by themselves would not have been too bad, but mix in going to the hospital to visit Alanna, doing my laundry, visiting with my parents who took me out for supper, and calculating moneys between my roommates and I for rent and food, and you have a crazy day. I have a test tomorrow in the psych course, and a whole list of things I need to do, which I'm not really looking forward to, but they have to be done.

Seeing Alanna today felt so good. I was so happy to see a smile on her face, and hoped that the stuffed gorilla I gave her helped out somewhat in putting that smile on her face. Although, I must also say I did feel fairly uncomfortable in the room with so many other people visiting her (maybe a minimum of about 8 people). I just really don't fit the other groups of family, friends from high school and church friends.. I'm just another guy, which made me wince everytime introductions of myself were made. I think I may feel better being able to talk with her more when she gets out and doesn't have an audience. Oh well, I got my wish of seeing her, and that's all that matters right now. I hope she didn't mind me coming.. and on a sidenote I really hope Nike feels better too. She was supposed to come with us, but the dear girl wasn't up to it, so I feel for her right now too. Get better Nike!!!

"event","Seriously people, I think I've reached a new level of frustration. I really want out of this place, and it's not really because of my roommates for once. I mean, I do get frustrated with my roommates sometimes, as we all have differing viewpoints on what the house should look like, and it does get annoying with 4 guys all wanting their part of the house, but tonight another issue rose above the rest. We have probably the most annoying people living above us that I have ever seen. They totally act snobbish towards us whenever we run into them, they don't allow us to use their extra parking spot behind the house, despite the fact that they have 1 car and we have 2, and have offered to pay them for the use of their spot, Erron had many a restless sleeps listening to two of them fucking away above the living room when he was sleeping in there, and tonight was the final straw. I was watching movies in my room, and constantly had the guy banging on the floor (my ceiling), so finally I banged back, which caused him to run down the stairs and bang on my front door, where he proceded to tell me to turn my fucking music off. I told him that his music upstairs was usually loud, and that we had to listen to them walking heavily all over their place, so it was only fair. He said that I should let them know if they're being to loud... I mean sure, I should be polite, but he has to bang on my floor and then tell me to turn down my fucking music to my face? I gave him a bit of my mind, but mostly held back, due to the fact we have to put up with the bastards for another 7 months, and I don't want to start a damn war. ARGGH... I need something to bash into the ground... smashy smashy....

It was such a good day too, spending the vast majority of it with Sarah, going out for mid afternoon lunch and then watching movies (The Ring and Jimmy Neutron) in my room on my computer. I was so happy, and that's why I'm so angry now for the guy to ruin it. I know that the only way I can relax again is to go to sleep and start a new day, or else my frustration level will lead me to an early grave. Goodnight ya'll."

"event","Sorry for the lack of posting, not really due to a lack of time, but more of a lack of exciting things going on in my life. Last night was a nice change. We ended up going out for supper for Goobdog's birthday at Branigans in the St. Vital Mall. It was a very good supper, and there were maybe, oh, 12 of us or so. After the delicious supper we went to go see ""The Recruit"" at Silver City. The movie wasn't too bad; a little predictable, but entertaining none the less. Got home fairly late, and then tried going to sleep, which seemed to take forever. This morning was constantly interrupted with phone calls, so I had difficulty sleeping for long periods of time. I finally dragged myself out of bed around 11:00, due to Sarah giving me a call. Enjoyed the call, but honestly, I must say I was still half asleep. Although I am so happy that Sarah is continuing with her schooling. She may not enjoy it right now, but it will be worth it in the end.

Today's plans... study for my psychology test on Monday, and do my Recombinant DNA assignment that is also due Monday. I might also go to visit Alanna in the hospital today with Nike, which I'm really hoping will happen. I've wanted to see her since the accident and it's been much too long not being able to set my worries to rest."

Other than that, I went to my classes today, which were super boring. Anika was not in adolescent development, so that class dragged by soooo slow. I got home and decided today could be a Sarah day, so we went out for lunch and then she chilled over here. After chilling for a bit, we drove over to the mall, and a few other places. Finally, we got back here at like, 6:30 or so. Having not slept the night prior, Sarah was a very tired girl. However, for some reason we decided it was necessary to have a big long ""wrestling"" match, if you can call it that. All I can say was that it was very exhausting, and now I'm stiff after we both spent, like a half hour wrestling a wooden stick from one another, and then much longer then that tossing each other around. I think I won, but I'm really not sure if either of us won, or if we both did. Oh well, it was incredibly fun. Thanks Sarah. ;)

What else to tell....? My parents got back from their trip to the Dominican Republic today! They had an amazing time. All-inclusive....apparently the bars were open 16 hours a day with all you can drink, and the rooms were fully stocked with drinks and alcohol. Nice. :) Plus, of course, the topless sunbathers that my dad throughly enjoyed. I spent a good hour today talking to my mom on the phone trying to catch up and arranging a day for her and dad to come in for supper soon. Other than that, I got my grad photo proofs back yesterday. I have the great task now of picking a proof I like, and then choosing a package..all so expensive. Hey you people out there that read my journal, which picture do you think looks the best?

Sometimes you take the simple things in life like that way too for granted. You need to sit back and just appreciate life. Dave, Goob and Shawna came over to visit as well, which was very nice to see. I also heard that Alanna is still awaiting surgery, but doing well overall. That makes me feel so good inside. After visiting Nike I made a brief stop at Andrea's, just to chat and get a hug she promised me. The hug was good.. I milked it for all that it was worth, lifting her up and doing the spin. Sometimes you just gotta be crazy, thanks Andrea. ;)

I guess I will type up some of the info that hasn't been told so far.  I was out Saturday night with the girls and we went out for supper and went to watch the movie ""Catch me if you can"" with Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio. It was pretty funny, but a little longer than I thought was necessary. They dropped me off at about 12:30 a.m again, and I was up at 6:30 to work on Sunday. I worked all day until 20 to 4, then drove my coworker to her kid's hockey game. After that I picked up Dave and drove back to my place. I found out about the accident from Dave and then phoned Nike's parents. We both went to Tom's to watch the Superbowl. I talked with Nike later last night to get the  tale from the source, and found out that the girls were alright. That brings me up to before my last post. I was pretty emotional during that one, but I'm a little better now. I think it hit me even harder because I was out with both of them for the last two nights. I want to give Nike a call today to check up on both her and Alanna. Hopefully Nike and I can go to the hospital to visit her very soon. Thanks to everyone that has listened to me get through this stuff.

Today was good. As I said before, I slept in, but went to my 11:30 class. After class I went to have lunch with Anika, finally, at Degrees. We had a good conversation, and we both had these delicious greek salads with chicken. Tasty stuff. She had a class at 1:30, and so took off then, and I went to meet Andrea in the lab to continue our wine-making project. Unfortunately, we could not do it today, so we'll be meeting again tomorrow to get it to the next step.

Now, I'm just sitting around, listening to music and thinking about what I want to accomplish this afternoon. Number one on the list is laundry because I have no clean clothes at all.. today was really pushing it. Our dryer is supposed to be getting replaced, but as of now, we have nothing, so I can't do my laundry here. Plus, I hate going to the laundromat. Oh well, I'll find someplace. That, and calling Nike are my priorities."

Two of my friends, both of whom I love dearly, Nike and Alanna, were in an accident today. They were hit by a car as they were crossing crosswalk in Osborne. The driver wasn't paying attention, and hit them. Nike is okay, with some bruising, and a concussion. That girl can stand up to anything. Alanna was hit more directly and broke her leg in two places and suffered a concussion. She's in the hospital awaiting surgery tonight.

I've been having a series of ups and downs tonight. It hurt again talking to Nike about everything, and now I feel terrible again. I wish nothing more than to be able to make their pains go away, or suffer their anguish myself so that they don't have to. Anyways, I really need to just go to sleep and let my emotions out again.

We ended up going to Academy Lanes to bowl for an hour.. we tried to get two lanes, but it was crazy busy there. I called it ""attack of the grade schoolers"" as the whole place was filled with young teenagers that were going crazy. Were we ever that loud and obnoxious as kids? I'd like to say no, of course not, but I'm sure we had our moments. Everyone did pretty well at the bowling, except for poor Goobdog. Thanks for coming out man ;)

Anyways, after bowling we headed to the Orbit Room, just off of Chancellor and Pembina. I had never been before, and I must say it was quite interesting. Had a pint of beer and a quasedilla. Oh, and half of a piece of apple spice cheesecake. That was amazing.. it was like apple pie, mixed with spice cake, mixed with cheesecake.... I'm glad Alanna couldn't finish her piece and offered it up. :) Might be a place I'd go back to, if even for beer and a pizza.

To close the evening, we went to Shooters to play pool. I ended up teaming up with Alanna, which was nice as we spent the whole time talking and I got to know her better. She's such a nice person to hang out with and chat with, must do it again sometime. We were not able to win at pool, but we came extremely close the second game, only losing by scratching off the eight-ball. No hard feelings.. if I played pool all the time I'd feel bad, but I rarely do, so I played up to my expectations. We all took off around 12:15, and I finally got to bed by around 1:00.

All today has been so far is waking up at 6:30 a.m to go to work. Work was like work always is... Just got home from work like, a half hour ago. Tonight's plans are in the works right now.. possibly going out to Empire, but I have to make some calls. Hopefully something good happens."

But again, for the third time this week, Andrea kept me company for our breaks. It's funny, we see each other every day in class, but never get to chill like this during the week, so it was a great time to just laugh it up, instead of reading my lab manual for the... well, close to 8 or 9th time. I think I know that damn manual better than the lab coordinator does. Oh well, maybe I'll do better on the lab exam. ;)

Well, I ran into Nike between classes like I was hoping, and hopefully we can get together with Alanna, and maybe someone else? Eh, I'm happy, haven't had much of a chance to get to know Alanna, so maybe I'll get the chance to tonight, and of course, any night with Nike is a fun night! :) Plus it gets me out of the house, as nobody is going to be home tonight.

I was also talking with Melissa online, whom plays volleyball with Andrea and Kara. I had helped her with some chem lab problems about a week ago, and now like to chat with her now and then as she seems like a really crazy and fun girl. Andrea had mentioned that her volleyball group was going to the Empire tomorrow night, and I think Melissa convinced me to come out, despite the fact I work at 7:30 both tomorrow and Sunday mornings. It will be rough, what with the early morning and a girl's volleyball team, but I'm a big boy, I can handle it... and want to handle it. ;)

In my closing, I've come to the realization that I have mentioned a ton of girlfriends and none of my guy friends, so to try and balance a little more, I'll just say I'm looking really forward to going to Ottawa for Reading Week with Tom and Dave. That should be an amazing time as I have never been that far east in Canada. I also might go to Tom's on Sunday to watch the Superbowl, depending on how I feel after Saturday's long night and Sunday's early morning. There, that will do. Sorry all you slow readers out there, I've probably taken a good chunk out of your evening. :)"

"event","Well tonight turned out to be a most excellent night. I ended up going bowling with Kenny as I has said before, but I also brought along Sarah, who really needed to get out of the house and see the world this week. We bowled for an hour, just finishing 3 games in that time. Luckily I was able to win all 3 games, but not by much, with Kenny on my heels the entire time, only losing by a single point the one game. I guess it makes up for him kicking my butt last time we bowled. As for Sarah, well, I guess I can say thanks for at least trying ;)

I dropped Kenny back home so that he could catch his cartoons for the night, and then went for a drive around the city. It was nice with the snow starting to fall. Sarah and I went to BP to have a drink and some food. I wanted chicken wings, so we got an order of super hot to share ( I love it when other people can handle the hot stuff too). I'm also proud of myself.. was going to order some deep-fried cheese as well, but instead opted for the veggie plate with low fat ranch dressing. That's right, ranch dressing. ;) Is this the start towards a healthier me? (maybe next time no chicken wings too).

That takes us to now. Will I go to bed early? Probably not, but it's nice to think I will. Oh yeah, one thing that royally pissed me off today was my stereo in my car. The damned thing wasn't working for most of the night, until finally near the end of the night, Sarah clicked it differently, and all of a sudden it worked extremely well, as if nothing had happened... *curses*. I swear, life is sometimes out to royally screw you. Anyways, that was the night. Until tomorrow......"

"event","Well today hasn't been too bad. Again, way beyond cold, but I handled it. Class went well, and I actually had an entertaining break between class chatting with Andrea, Tara and Johanna and eating lunch. Luckily the guy-bashing was kept to a minimum in my presence, but the amount of estrogen at the table was a little too high. Oh well, in my opinion. that can also be a very good thing. ;)

I've come to the realization that my white pants attract anything that will stain to them. I have many different colours of pants, but this one particular pair I am wearing today is the only pair I ever spill anything on, and is by far the hardest pair to get anything off of... after spending a long time getting spaghetti sauce off them from last time, what did I spill on them today? Lousiana Sauce from my lunch... curses.....

On another note, I'm going out tonight with Kenny (my buddy from the Best Buddies program.. there is a social on February 7th people, come out!! Tickets are cheap and include a free ...um.. beverage of some sorts) Kenny and I are going glow bowling for an hour or two tonight, see how we do. I also decided to be wild and crazy and bought this coloured hair gel today. Was going to get a crazy colour, but bought yellow because it looked much more natural. My hair is too short anyways to do anything crazy with it. (I'm at the point now where I keep it below 1/2 inch) Unfortunately people, this is as crazy as I get, sorry to disappoint.

Now just killing time before having supper and picking up Kenny.. hopefully I can arrange to do something after bowling and dropping off Kenny.. anyone have suggestions, let me know ( and no, you can't say study :P ) 

Oh yes, next goal, bring other people onto my friends list so more people actually read my journal."

"event","Hmm, was just sitting around munching down on a large pizza pretzel when work phoned me at 4:25 to come in... which was odd, as normally the work shift starts at 3:30. I was told that they had a no show and were desperate to fill the shift. Enter me to save the day again. So I braved the cold weather once again to go help them out and just got home now. Could have been worse I suppose (I could have worked until midnight). Anyways, now I have to do the few things I meant to do today starting at after 10... joy.

You know, it's strange... I hate cold weather but I seem to be able to withstand it much better this year. I mean, sure I have an extra 60 pounds on me to keep me warm, which is a good thing as I can be stubborn about putting on a whole bunch of extra layers, even when certain friends tell me I should. It's so nice to be healthy this year. After last year's endless sickness, it's nice to be able to go outside without shivering so hard you end up sore for the entire night.

Even still, I know I don't look too bad, but I'd definately like to start some exercising and getting more in shape.. I never have before due to illness and lack of energy, but I finally have the body mass I can shape into something I want. I am starting to try some healthier alternatives in my meals, and will definately start walking again once it reaches a temperature where certain parts of my body are not forced into hibernation. Oh well, goals are just goals until you start some action on them... unfortunately I'm currently working towards the title of procrastinator king, making such action difficult.

Wow, 2 bigs posts in a day.. we'll see if it's a pattern."

"event","Man is it cold out. Just got back from school maybe half an hour ago, and trying to warm myself up somewhat. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if our house wasn't so badly insulated. If the temperature is at a decent level in some parts of the house, the parts that don't have heating vents are very cold. Oh well, at least I can put a hoodie and slippers on to warm up. It's gonna be a bitch here in the summer, and I can sense some nudity may be involved ;)

Not sure what's up for this afternoon. I should honestly be doing schoolwork, but I feel so anxious to go out with people, or just a single person to just hang and chat. I love going out to a lounge and having a drink and some type of appetizer, but I've never found a regular person that would go with me and hang all the time... maybe I just can't find someone with that same interests as me.

Speaking of same interests, the search for celery continues... celery with lots of ranch dressing... there are very few people who will get that joke and know what I really mean, but it makes me laugh so I'll say it anyways. If you're really curious, just ask me sometime. Things didn't work out in class today as I had hoped as Anika had plans for lunch already, so I never got around to asking her. Other than that, I'm hoping to visit Nike sometimes this week, and I hope it works out! :) 

Well, there... I think I've realized I'm more of a one big post a day type of person. It's just so much easier to dump everything out of your brain than to slowly let it leak out."

"event","If you asked me a week ago if I would ever have an online journal, I would have flat out said no. Now, here I am posting my first big entry into my brand new online waste heap. Oh well, sometimes life is just funny that way. 

Anyways, I think I started this more as a way to express myself to the world, and whomever feels it necessary to dive into my thoughts can go right ahead, however I do leave you with a warning; I myself don't usually understand what I'm thinking most of the time and you may risk your own mind trying to figure me out. With that warning out of the way, you're on your own from here on in.

The day has been long. I didn't have my med virology class today, which gave me the happiest point of my day. I've been feeling kind of lousy for about a week now.. I think I need to get some more sleep, as it's getting just so hard to get out of bed each and every morning. It doesn't help that I've worked one day out of the last 3 weekends, and am not getting chances to sleep in at all, combined with my inability to get into a really deep sleep. Oh well, I'm sure I'll be good if I can get at least one decent sleep in sometime this week, I'll have to see what happens. Other than that, it's time to go get something to soothe my parched throat. Maybe another posting before bedtime, see how I feel."

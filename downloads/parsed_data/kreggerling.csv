"event","Thinking about this for some time.
I prefer the company of warm blooded real people
not the cold words of a machine.
Real words.
Somethings I don't want to know about.
Somethings should just disappear.
So on that note I move on to something ....else.


   THE FIGUREHEAD

Sharp and open
Leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
as the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting
In the cold light
A noise
A scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year.
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow
Please let me sleep
As I slip down the window
Freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing
You mean nothing.
I can lose myself in Chinese art of American girls
All the time
Lose me in the dark
Please do it right
Run into the night
I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain
My heart explodes
My memory in a fire
And someone will listen
At least for a short while.
I can never say no to anyone but you.
Too many secrets
Too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets
Please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me
In sequence
In despair of time.
I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes
Pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again
Touch her eyes
Press my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again..."

I figured I'd be here for awhile.The place has lots of perks, separate
studio,laundry,fireplace,close park,etc......and some no-so-good
things too,wierd layout for bathrooms,shared access into a part of 
my apartment for shared laundry,etc.

But I sure as fuck wouldn't have taken this place if I had known It
would be up for sale a few months later.So next week is an open 
house,I've got people stomping through my personal space,I'll
have to take the day off so I can take my dogs away so they won't
get stressed out,and I've been asked to do some things to help the real
estate agent out...measure rooms etc.

All in all I really miss the large, comfy, affordable apartments in the East
Coast.And if I wanted to buy a place I could....but not in Vancouver where
buying a home is exclusive to the very rich.

So fuck all you greedy property owners. Hope you all rot in your
putrid , stinking money."

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

The real-estate agent comes by on Thursday...so far they
have six parties interested in the property and that's before
even being liisted. Half are home buyers and half are off shore

a home and off shore landlords can be a fucking nightmare.

<br />to genuinely connect with others, and need to
<br />be appreciated. They do everything with
<br />quality and are devoted and loyal friends and
<br />employers/employees. Whatever or whomever
<br />they commit to are their sole (and soul)
<br />focus. They love to serve and will give
<br />freely of themselves in order to nurture
<br />others lives.

BLUES, however, do need to be understood. They have
<br />distinct preferences and occasionally the
<br />somewhat controlling (but always fair)
<br />personality of a confident leader. Their code
<br />of ethics is remarkably strong and they
<br />expect others to live honest, committed lives
<br />as well. They enjoy sharing meaningful
<br />moments in conversation as well as
<br />remembering special life events (i.e.,
<br />birthdays and anniversaries). BLUES are
<br />dependable, thoughtful, nurturing, and can
<br />also be self-righteous, a bit worry-prone,
<br />and emotionally intense. They are like
<br />sainted pit-bulls who never let go of
<br />something once they are committed. When you
<br />deal with a BLUE, be sincere, make an effort
<br />to truly understand them, and truly
<br />appreciate them.

"event","COMMUNICATION,UNION , REUNION.

This Rune < R > is concerned with communication, with the attunement of something
that has two sides,two elements,and with the ultimate reunion that comes at the end of 
journey,when what is above and what is below are united and of one mind.

Inner worth mounts here,and at such a time you must remember that you are not intended
to rely entirely upon your own power,but rather to ask what constitutes right action.Be content
to wait ; while you wait ,keep on removing resistances.As the obstacles give way,all remorses
arising from "" trying to make it happen"" disapppears.

The journey is toward self-healing,self-change and union.You are concerned here with nothing
less than unobstructed,perfect union.But the union of the Spiritual and Earth cannot be forced.
Regulate any excesses in your life.Stand apart even from like-minded individuals;the notion of 
strength in numbers does not apply here;for this part of the journey cannot be shared.

Another of the cycle Runes,RAIDO,represents the soul's jorney and has within it the element
of joy,for the end is in sight.No longer burdened by what you have left behind , Spiritual and Earth
unite within you to support you on your way.
I will to thy will."

"event","So through all the joy and smugness of finding a pretty
good place to live there was the little niggly tug at the base of 
my spine saying "" is this too good to be true?""  This house used
to belong to a disabled lady who modified many things in her 
house to reflect her needs..so it has a few odd features...whatever.
She passed away a year ago and her caretaker was willed the main
floor suite and her nephews were willed the upper and lower suites.
So ... the nephews decide to buy out the caretaker and rent her suite
with the idea of maybe selling in several years or so. In comes me,
I hear of this place from a great customer of mine , and it sounds great.
It is great ... I specifically say "" I have been looking for a really long time
and I want a home for a very long time ( Maybe purchase the house 
several years down the road ?? With help from One significant other
perhaps?) .
No problem the nephews are in Toronto and want no part of the house
other than some extra cash from rentals.
            And today , no later than three weeks after I move in , I'm told that the nephews
have decided not to buy out the main suite , that thay wish to sell the house and
split the monies accordingly !!! W T F !! The executor of the estate  has said not to
worry cause it takes forever for these guys to do anything.....but whats to wait for ?
The tenant on the main floor clearly wants to sell..they want to sell and judging by the 
one day open house of a property that sold that day, the can sell this place FAST!
So yeah by law I got three months to find a place...but if I have to move again I will
definately go off the deep end.....move my ass into Le Nuthouse....
Fucking hell.... I really need a drink."

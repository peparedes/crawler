"event","Well I have Patella tendinitis, the doctor has ordered me to stop biking for a week and running for two weeks.  After that I have to take it easy and build a base back up.  What this really means for me is I'm not running in Bay to breakers this year like I wanted to.  With only three weeks left until the run I just won't be ready, I will have one week after injury to train again and it won't be enough.  

In the mean time I am going to switch to a more comprehensive weight training program so I don't go insane from lack of exercise, I am thinking I'll go to the gym five or six days next week.  The week after that, once I'm on my bike again, I'll go four or five days.  For a few weeks after that I will still go four days a week because I  won't be putting the same effort into my running and biking while I build my base back up."

"event","After getting white paint on my summer jacket, from pdx6's elevator, I haven't had a lite weight jacket to wear in the warmer months of the year.  A jacket to wear in the mornings and evenings when there is a bit of chill in  the air.  Well since it's the time of year where my normal jacket is starting to get a bit warm I went shopping.  

I got to the store and dug around through the racks, most stores had no jackets or heavy weight winter ones still, but I persisted and eventually found an acceptable one.  Then I tried it on and it was too large, WTF?! It was an XL and most of the jackets in my closet are XXL!  Thinking it was the cut of the jacket I tried on a few other XL jackets and they where all too large.  So I tried L expecting to be disappointed and find I am yet again between sizes.  But it fit perfectly!  

In other news I begin an 8 week training program for bay to breakers next week.  I will be lifting weights twice a week, running three days a week, and cycling two days a week.  Friday will be the only day of the week where I completely rest.  I want to finish the 12k race in under an hour, but I will be happy just finishing it."

Well I already got the Macbook, I needed a christmas present for myself, which means I have to switch my goals around.  Here they are, at 200 I can buy myself a 42"" or smaller flat screen and a couch.  At 185 I can buy myself a MINI cooper sport, haven't decided on a 2008 or 2007.  I've need a new car if I'm going to be commuting using one and I was planing on giving the Saturn to my younger sister for her 16th birthday which is coming up this June.  

After a week of doing the 90 mile round trip commute I decided it was time to find a place in the south bay, I looked at ten places today and found one I like.  On Monday I plan to go put in an application, the apartment opens up on April 1st and the soonest I can move in is the 3rd in any case."

"event","So for about two weeks I was spending a lot of my free time working on personal projects.  I wrote my own profiling toolkit using GCC extenstions.  I learned the basics of Java which seems like a really weak language to do object oriented work in.  I started picking up DirectX.  I wrote a cross platform fractal based terain generator, it uses X and Win32 directly as well as supporting OpenGL and DirectX.

The problem is I got bored with all these projects quickly, they have no real use for my day to day life.  I suppose I could tackle a project that would have some useful results, but I realize nothing I do with a computer on a day to day basis needs fixing.  Realistically I need to write a large opensource project in Java so that I can put it on my resume, since C/C++ seems to be going the way of the Dodo except in a specific areas.  

Maybe I should write some simple games in Java, using both OpenGL and DirectX, and then release them as opensource.  I have the AI backends for checkers, tic-tac-toe and chess which I wrote in a college AI class.  I can tack on a GUI and graphical representations and be on my way.

In other news life is moving along, recently found out about my ten year highschool reunion.  Been going to the gym three or four days a week.  Been working about sixty hours a week.  Not doing much else."

Well in case you didn't get the picture I'm traveling for work again.  I've been back to Houston, my favorite city in the United States, twice in the last two weeks.  At least lately it has been new tasks and new companies.  I've been playing with VisRooms and large SMP machines for a change.  In fact this week I got to play with a 64 processor SGI, with 640 Gigabytes of RAM and 16 graphics pipes (video cards for those of you who don't know the SGI lingo).  The machine is fairly cool, but it lags in performance.  It runs Itanium chips and ATI x3 video cards.  I got to spend a lot of time talking computer architecture with someone who is an expert, he gave me a good explanation of why most code runs slow on the ia64 chipset.  It also allowed me to finally understand why the architecture is so bad.  Got to spend some time playing with ATI cards and seeing how they handle various OpenGL streams.  I got to see the major differences between the PCI-Express and ATI bus.  

Well that's it for now :)"

The plan is to use an old Athlon I have lying around, I will either install Gentoo and <a href=""http://www.mythtv.org/"">Myth TV</a> or <a href=""http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html"">KnoppMyth</a>.  If I can get the hardware and software issues all solved I will then purchase a mini/micro atx case and motherboard and build a passively cooled set top.  

The only problem is I wanted at least a prototype running early next week.  Afterall the Olympics start soon and there are some TV shows that I watch.  Alas I have been called away to Houston where I must spend three days doing customer installs.  That means when the package arrives at the office on Tuesday morning I will already be on a plane.  I won't be able to get back into the office to pick it up until Friday.

I mainly wanted to get this done before the TV industry pushed through some draconian DRM method which would make recording live TV with a homebrewed system illegal.  So the delay will only cause me to miss things I'll planing to test with next week.  Just the same it sucks that my newest toy will be sitting at my desk for three days untouched.

I have not had more then four consecutive days in Oakland during that period.  Most of the time was spent traveling for work, but I did take a five day vacation for a friends wedding during that period too.

It has been an interesting experience traveling this much for work.  I've ran into a gambit of system problems some of which actually forced me to learn new things.  I have met a lot of people, too many to recount.  Some of them where able to teach me a lot about my chosen profession.  Most of them where just sales and marketing types which really didn't interest me.

Despite all I learned and experienced during my time on the road I am happy to be home*.  It is hard to travel that much, it wears you down.  You spend your days working and your nights entertaining customers and partners.

"event","Well, I'm back from Houston.  Hopefully this is my last trip for the near future.  I've always liked to travel, but traveling for work can be an exhausting experience.  In four nights and five days I slept about sixteen hours.  It's amazing what can go wrong when setting up for a trade show or customer demo, I did both this trip.  It is stressful having five people stare over your shoulder watching you make changes to a config file in hopes of getting everything to just work.  It's even worse after you've been working for seventeen hours straight.

Now don't get my wrong I didn't spend every late night slaving over system setups.  Since the tradeshow was successfull one of our partners took us out for dinner.  We proceded to drink four bottles of wine at a BYOB resturant.   Now a BYOB resturant right next to a liquor store is interesting.  Every table had multiple bottles of wine on it, but none of it served by the resturant.  The whole concept of a BYOB resturant was new to me and quite cool.

Of course this much drinking lead to some interesting, and very loud, conversation about the well augemented women sitting at the table next to us.  They where very young, you probably know the type; tight low cut pants, tight halter top of some type and some ink on the small of their back, sitting with a group of older men (grey in their hair).  Well one of these young ladies happened to overhear the conversation and get a little upset, well indignant is probably closer to the right word.  I can't really understand the reason, if you behave like that in public you've gotta expect people to comment on it.

"event","Well I went on vacation for the fourth of july weekend.  In fact I just got back into the bay area two hours ago.  I went and visited some of my family in Ohio.  So at this point you may be wondering why this is important; I'll tell you why!  

I realized while patching up a hole in the barn roof that I hate the city.  Yes, while I was on my hands and knees on the top of a rickety old barn I realized living in the city sucks donkey dick.  It was comforting to be able to go to sleep with all the doors unlocked and the windows open.  It was nice to be able to let the dog out to run free.  It was nice getting up and doing work that was ""real"".  

This has lead me to the conclusion that I'm not compatable with myself.  My various passions in life collide in such a way where I can never be truely happy.  Nothing reaches my soul like the simple pleasures that can be found in the middle of a forest, while floating down a giant river, while pounding nails with my family.  However, my other true passion is computers, I love to solve complex problems.  I love to be able to say I can do this in a novel and interesting way. 

At this point you may be wondering why these passions cannot co-exist.  Well it is simply because I cannot find a job as an admin or engineer where I want to live.  There is no work for software engineers in the Yukon or in Mid Ohio farmland.  My other choice would be to work as a farm-hand or a construction worker, simply put I've already tried and given up.  I cannot do any work day in and day out that does not tax me mentally."

I really don't like living here, most people tell me it will grow on me, but I just don't know if it ever will.  However, due to the expense of moving here I can't leave for at least a year.  If I do move I don't know where I would go, I'm not a city person but there is not a lot of work for software engineers outside of the big cities.  Maybe I should have considered that when I decided what field to go into.  Too bad it seems like computer science was the perfect fit for me, I mean it is what I was meant to do with my life.  That and the pay is good enough to buy the type of toys I like to play with. 

So far I love what we are doing where I work, however I hate the hours.  At first it didn't bother me, but now that I am finally getting some time off I realize how hard it was on me.  To put this is perspective, my first 5 weeks I had a single day off, my shortest day in that period was 10 hours long, my longest day was 14 hours.  Now things are closer to normal, I'm at the office between 9-11 hours a day and we take long lunches most days.  Plus I've had six days off in the last two weeks.  

I've been flying all over the country with trips to Houston (twice), Denver and San Diego.  It looks like there is one more Houston trip in the near future and possibly a couple trips overseas, if I get my passport in time.  Now if you like to travel like I do you might be thinking this is cool, however it is not.  These work trips are filled completely with work, when I'm out of town I actually work more then when I am in town, so I don't get time to explore or do any interesting things.

Well that's it for now."

Despite the fact that most of my friends don't want me to leave I think they are all happy for me.  

However, here comes the bad news.  I have to start on the first.  I won't be able to start moving until Wenesday of next week.  So that does not leave a lot of time for me to find a place and move.  In fact I don't know if it is going to be possible.  But I'm going to try it anyway because I really want to start on the first for a few different reasons.  In the worst case I'm going to haul my stuff down there next weekend and drop it in storage for a week or two while I find a place.  Meanwhile I will sleep on a friends couch who lives in San Jose.  It would be a sucky commute but it will have to do."

It's in Oakland, which some would say is a good thing, but I don't know if I want to move to a bigger city.  It's for a startup, but they have a working product and customers already.  In any case I have a very big decision to make over the weekend and I don't have a clue how to make it."

"event","Well one of my friends from the bay flew in on Thursday afternoon.  The plan was to ride and party for the weekend.  So to kick off the partying we went drinking at the Low Tide, nickname for the southern Flowing tide, on thursday night.  We show up at the bar and find not only the miller beer girls giving blind taste tests but also dollar miller and miller lites until they leave, woohooo.  So they come up to our table and ask if we would like to do the blind taste test.  Now we did what any sane group of males would do when a bunch of very well endowed women asked us if we would like free beer, we said yes.  Since one of my friends actually picked miller in the taste test we got our pictures taken with the girls and he got a t-shirt.  Then the serious drinking begain.  About four shots of Yager, five beers and a Irish car bomb later we decided it was time to leave the bar.  Afterall we had to ride in the morning.  

I managed to make is home and pass out.  I really don't remember much between the bar and my alarm going off at 7am.  In any case I make a pot of coffee and get my gear packed.   At this point I'm feeling good.  No hangover and I'm not tired.  Well my friends show up and we load the car.  After an hour drive and a stop at the gas station to load up on power bars we hit the slopes at Northstar.  This is where the real fun begins, it's a perfect day at the slopes.  We ride and have fun all morning and into the afternoon.  However, about 2:30PM the drinking from the night before combined with the fact that I'm overdressed for the weather starts to catch up.  At this point I quite literally just fall over at the bottom of the run and wallow in the snow to cool off.  We got some water and managed one more trip to the top of the mountain before we decided it was time to call it a day.  All in all it was a great day on the slopes, not too packed with good snow.  Too bad the hangovers made us call it quits early.

Now around rolls friday night.  We meet up and get some chinese food, yum.  Then we go back to my friends house for a few rounds of XBox games along with shots of wild turkey for the losers.  But we make sure to call it an early night so we can survive another day of riding.

I have my alarm set for 7am again.  I'm tired, hungover again and my body is bitching how much it hurts from the previous day of riding.  I'm thinking that I shouldn't ride again, but then I man up and decide that if my friend is in from the bay and wants to ride I'll go.  Afterall the pain is temporary and my body will heal.  Luckly for me I get a call about 7:30am from my friends saying the decision is to ride again on sunday instead of today.  This leads to going back to sleep until lunch time.

For lunch we decide to go the sierra gold, a decent little sports bar where we order up some food and beer.  Well looking over at the bar one of my friends realizes they know the bartender, of course after he points that out we all realize we know the bartender.  Well this leads to the midday bender because she was bored and wanted us to keep her company till her shift was over.  Since I was going to be hanging out at a bar all afternoon I figured I might as well drink.  A couple rounds of shots and about five gin&tonics later we roll back to my friends house.  We turn on the XBox again and start playing games, the loser has to take a shot of wild turkey.  About six shots and four hours later we decided it was time to go downtown.  The bartender from earlier was supposed to meet us with some of her friends.  Well as normal when going downtown I ran into a lot of people I know.  In fact I bailed on the bartender and my friends to hang out with some other people.  This was the much better idea as the girls I decided to hang out with called one of my roommates so they could get a ride home.  Lo and behold my roommate shows up, I didn't know about the phone call, and asks the girls when they want to leave.  Well we hung out for a bit longer then we all piled into his car and came home.  

Now I am sitting at home and I have no idea where my car is.  I either left it at a friends house or at a bar.  Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to con a roommate into taking my around town to look for it.  That is it for the weekend so far, I do have plans to go drinking tomorrow during the football games.  The riding has been canceled again."

"event","Well today is just going great.  I got called by PC-Doctor about setting up a interview for an entry level software engineer position and I setup a phone interview with ModViz in Oakland.  For the past two months I have been fairly depressed.  After all, I went to school for many years to learn all there was to know about software development.  Now I cannot claim I did learn all there was to know, I can barely claim the curriculum taught me anything.  However, I did learn and expand to the point where I consider myself a passable programmer with a deep understanding of ""computer science"".  After all this I spent months without getting a single responce to any job posting I sent my resume in for, it was depressing to think that all my knowledge meant nothing with respects to getting a job.

Of course now comes the interviews.  While I'm really happy right now I'm already questioning what is going to happen in the interviews.  My last major interview was at google and they basically destroyed any confidence I had in my ability as a System Administrator.  The guy interviewing made me seem like a dullard and then they did not even get back to me to tell me no.  However, I now realize that it was a very tough interview and that I did really well, just not up to google's standards I guess.  But will the upcoming interviews be as tough?  What will they ask me?  Should I study?  If I do what should I study?

In any case I'm mixed with feelings of joy, after all I feel like the last few years of my life have not been a complete waste.  But I am also filled with dread that my upcoming interviews will destroy my sense of self worth again."

The only responces I've gotten on my latest batch of resumes have been automated.   I have not been sleeping.  Basically nothing is going right.  

I've gotten to the point with my job search where I just start writing cover letters without paying attention and when I go over them to check for obvious mistakes I end up horrified and have to start over, here is an example of one I almost sent off today:

<quote>Dear Human Resources,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering position you have listed on http://www.dice.com.

I am currently working on my Masters degree in computer science at the University of Nevada.  My course work is finished and I am in the process of finishing my Thesis.  The majority of my course work has been focused on computer graphics and high performance computing, with emphasis on software development for parallel environments.

I have over seven years experience writing software in C/C++ on many different platforms.  Honesly, I don't know why I'm telling you this.  Afterall, you are not going to read this, then gloss over my resume and either decided I'm over or under qualified and toss it in the trash.  In fact I'm willing to bet you hate your job so much that you don't even look at 9/10ths of the cover letters that show up in your inbox.  In any case I am qualified for the job, but it does not matter to you.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email and my resume.  I'm looking forward to the chance to discuss the position and my qualifications with you in more detail.

Sincerly,
</quote>

As you can see it is not what I would want to send off.  But I'm so tired and feed up with the whole process of job searching that I start zoning out and writing stuff like that.  

Okay I'm rambling at this point.  I just wanted to share my life with all the interested readers out there."

I want to create things and as an admin my entire job is fixing other peoples problems.  In any case I suppose it's too early to be considering if I want to take the job as I haven't even been offered it yet.  I am in the process of setting up a phone interview with the search comittee for after new years.  If the phone interview works out then they will fly me out for a day long interview.  Then if that works out I can consider if I want the job or not.

On another note, thinking back factory work and construction work really was not that bad of a way to go.  I mean I get to create things, I get to work with my hands and I stay busy all day.   After the day is done you get to go home and don't have to even think about work till the new day starts.  The pay is above average for the working class, which is way below the pay a sysadmin or engineer gets.

Well it's just a thought."

Now I would never consider anything inapproiate with her, but she does have a nice ass.  So of course I said yes.  It was fun and there where piles of people everywhere.  I did get three free drinks from her, but that was it for my night.  Afterall I have this habit of ""babysitting"" girls when I go out.  I get rid of guys they don't want, make sure nothing bad happens to them and make sure they get a warm safe place to sleep.  However, this does interfere with me attempting to pick-up on other women.

Anyway it was a good change of pace, recently the only times I have been out drinking have been with the guys.   Which generally means a night of beer and sports bars.  Tonight was clubs and mixed drinks :)"

"event","Well this has been an interesting week for me.  I was planing on talking to my boss this week and ask him to hire me on under a different contract at the end of the month, as classified staff instead of as a graduate assistant.  We have discussed this before and I was hoping to come to a agreement this time around.  It did not work out like I was hoping it would.  On monday afternoon a faculty member came by to introduce me to the guy they hired to replace me.  Apparently they took the thought of me not renewing my contract as a student very seriously and actively searched for a replacement.  Now they guy they hired to replace me seems fairly intelligent, however in no way is he qualified to replace me.  In fact when he found out I don't have a new job yet he began to question why they hired him.  I told him that he was not pushing me out of my job, I was leaving because I chose to.  Still this leaves me wondering what I am going to do, I have been working to support myself since shortly after my 15th birthday.  I don't know how to survive without a job that pays all my bills.  I'm too proud to beg money off anyone, this is even more true in this case where I am unempolyed because of my own misplaced ego.  The one that told me I would have no problem finding a job by the end of December.

This sudden possiblitly of unemployment has been causing my havoc in my personal life as well.  I am unfocused in just about everything I do.  I have not been showing up to my clan matches, while I am not the best player in the squad I am important.  I have been sleeping through meetings that I want to go to, like 2600.  I have been blowing off house guests, there where 10 in the house tonight and I just closed and locked my bedroom door.  I was supposed to go to many graduation parties tonight, so far I've blown them all off.  I used said parties to blow off Drunken Movie Night, which I wanted to attend as well.

The only solace I've had since this Monday was a trip to Boreal on Friday.  It is a small crappy ski resort, but it only cost $10 for the whole day with a student ID.  So I packed up my car and drove the 40 miles, I put on my ski boots and clipped into my bindings.  Then I proceded to forget about all my problems for three hours, the only thing that mattered to me was going down the hill.  I emptied my mind of all my problems and just rode the snow.  Of course since then all my problems have come crashing back down and I've done nothing today except sit in my bedroom.  I've looked at a few jobs and even sent my resume to one.   But that's it."

"event","Well all I have to say is bah!  There are some really stupid things going on in my life that I can't discuss until later this weekend, of course the only reason I'm involved is I live with one of the people  commiting the insane act.  It really sucks, but being a good friend and roommate prevents me from intervening no matter how much I feel I should prevent it from going any farther.  In any case I probably wouldn't intervene because it will eventually lead to a more stable and sane life for me.

Other then that, I'm cooking food for tomorrow, yeah turkey day.  One thing most people don't know about me is I love to cook and the holidays allow me to.  So I started out planing a simple meal for my friends who are not flying home to visit family.  It turned into me buying the stuff to make every Thanksgiving food I like, plus I took requests from some of the other people.  Now to get dinner on the table by 5:00pm I will have to cook most of the day.  Luckly I can see the TV from the kitchen so I won't miss much of the various football games on.

Well I just wanted to post something, so happy Thanksgiving everyone."

For some reason I spent about an hour of the night distracting the uber bitch, don't know why but I hope to find out later today.  In any case I'm really drunk and had some fun dancing with some chicks dressed as gypsys/belly dancers.

"event","So I'm at my friends house eating some pizza, drinking some beer and watching the world series.  It's the bottom of the bottom of the seventh inning and I get a call from one of my roommates, ""The contractor is going to start redoing the bathroom in the morning.""  Now the last thing I had heard about getting the bathroom redone was the landlord had to get it approved, then the contractor had to schedule some time to do it.  In any case my responce was, ""Some more notice would have been good but I guess it's too late now.""

Anyway I finish watching the game and then come home and I find the bathtub and toliet already missing out of the bathroom.  My first thought was to get some of my personal hygiene items outta the bathroom, I really don't want my toothbrush in the bathroom when they are ripping out carpet and such.  My next thought it where did they put all the junk, well I found it in the garage.  It is in the garage blocking my access to both of my bikes and all my tools.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?!?!

Now I could possible see how some heathen, not converted to the zen of cycling, could assume just because it's cold and snowing that no one is using the bikes.  However, my roommate was supervising them and he knows I just bundle up and ride anyway.  So for the next week, even though the contractor says three days, four of us will be sharing the bathroom that is in the master bedroom and I won't have access to my bikes.  I really hope the guy who lives in the master bedroom as no intention of having sex during the week because it will be a bit awkward when one of us has to take a piss.  As for the bikes I will try to convince the contractors that they must move the toliet and bathtub out of my path.  

So my day started with having to go in and fix the mail server and it ended with coming home to my bathroom being ripped apart.  The only way it could get worse is having my home PC die."

The storm that is blowing into Reno is making my knee all stiff, old sports injury.  It feels like my right shoulder is seperated from my birthday beating last night, a archaic tradition that should be put to rest.  My right hip is stiff and sore from a recent mountain biking accident where I didn't yeild to a tree properly.  Finally my lower back is hurting from a combination of many things.  

Basically I am a gimp right now, no not the black leather wearing type gimp.  I have to get up and sit down slowly, I limp around a bit and I feel like shit.  It is a humbling experience, a feeling of mortality, a glimpse into the future where I cannot just push my physical limits day in and day out without consequence.

"event","Well last night I had my birthday party.  As I expected there where somewhere between 15-30 people around most of the night.  About 10:00pm those of us old enough to go out left in search of some bars.  Our first stop was Brew Brothers, a decent microbrewery with a live band.  I ran into about five people who should have at least swung by my place for the party, all of them had the same excuse for not showing up.  Apparently I didn't invite them.  Well since they didn't swing by my party they bought me some drinks.  

This eventually led to the second and final spot of the night Bubinga's.  In terms of Reno clubs, it's the best in town.  Compared to some of the clubs I've been to in Vegas, LA and NY it really sucks.  But then again what do you expect, Reno is not that big of a town.  Now I can be described as shy, which is not true, I'm more withdrawn then shy.  This leads to interesting situations at clubs where hundreds of people are crammed into a dance floor that is too small.  Mainly it makes me uncomfortable, I like my space.  Since I am uncomfortable I become even more withdrawn, I don't smile, I don't dance and I don't talk much.  

However, this does not work well when you are with a bunch of girls who want to dance.  Since they want to dance and I'm standing there they attempt to make me dance.  This generally involves one or two girls attempting to make me dance by dancing around me while I stand there.  Truthfully I don't mind the attention, but I still stay withdrawn.  This leads to them feeding me drinks, figuring if I drink enough I will actually dance with them.  While to a certain extent it does.  The more drunk I become the more I am able to handle the crowds.  In any case I spent most of the night either standing there as some girl tried to dance with me or I swayed from side to side a bit to convince them I was actually making an attempt to dance.  

At about 2:30am my roommate and I gathered up the girls to drunk to drive and herded them to the car.  We dropped a couple of them off at home and then got some food.  We took the rest of them home with us and put them to sleep on the couches and called it a night.

I woke up this morning and everyone was gone already, I cleaned up after the party and then I started watching some of the college ball games.  So all in all it turned out to be a great birthday."

Well I bought a new bike, Jamis Dakar XC Comp, it floats through rocky downhills.  I almost feel like I'm riding a paved trail at times.  However, it does not climb like I'm used to.  Nothing climbs like a lite hardtail with a short travel fork.  Well maybe a lite no suspension bike does.  But since I don't own one it does not matter to me.  Anyway I've been getting a lot of Fall riding in, the weather has been perfect.  However, since Bush is coming into town tomorrow my favorite trail is closed for the day.  I guess I'll just have to drive my bike somewhere instead of riding to the trailhead from my front door.

Nothing new on the Job front.  I'm still looking, going to send my resume into IGT yet again as there is a new job posting today for a software engineer.  Other then that I'm finding a lot of contract work.  I don't want to move out of Reno for a 3-6 month contract somewhere.  It would be stupid and I would be spending the entire contract period trying to line up my next job which would be too stressfull.  I don't mind doing contract work, it would just need to be local or allow me to telecommute.

I'm also having my birthday party friday night.  Yes I'm turning a year older on friday.  Another year of accomplishing nothing at all.  Maybe before my next birthday I will have accomplished something to be proud of.  Actually I take that back.  This year I did do something I'm very proud of.  I lost 60 lbs through diet and exercise.  I did not reach my goal, but looking back my goal was unreachable.  I've also cut back on my drinking a lot.  Anyway I'm trying to keep my birthday small, so far I've only invited about 10 people.  So I don't expect more then 30 people to show up all night.  I will get very drunk, kick the underage people out of my house and end up drinking at some bar downtown by the end of the night.  My goals for the next year are to lose another 50 lbs and to start my career.  I do not want to keep working at temporary jobs.  I want to go someplace and work there without thoughts of what I'm going to do next.

Well that's it for tonight."

During the spring and summer it is a time for growth and expansion.  In my life that translates to meeting new people and doing new things.  I try to grow as a person during the warm months of the year.  My life becomes more energetic.  

However, in the winter I tend to focus inward.  It is a time to work out my personal issues, some of which I share with my friends some of which I keep bottled up to work out by myself.  My biggest two goals for this winter are weight loss last winter I managed to lose 60+ pounds, and finding a job.  The first major goal I have well in hand, I just have to watch what I eat and contine exercising.  The second goal is not so easy.  I have been looking for a job for many months but I have had no luck.  In my mind that means there is something wrong with me or at least my presentation of my skills.  So I need to focus on both my skills and my resume.  

Of course many people have presented the idea that I cannot find a job because I don't really want one.  It has been said that I may not want to grow up, I may not want to move on with my life.  I really can't comment on that idea because I have not spent any time thinking about it.  At least the colder days ahead will allow me to contemplate the idea from time to time."

In any case I hope it clears up as the snow puts a big damper on my favorite outdoor activity for this time of year, I don't like riding my bike through the snow afterall.  As I tend to ride in the mountains this is a major issue.  

However, this does suggest the possiblity of a early and good ski season.  Which is always a great thing.  I just wish I had a season pass somewhere and a car with all wheel drive ;)  I can solve the season pass issue but I'm not buying a new car.

Other then that it's a great day because the Raiders won.  Last night the UNR football game was fun, even though I retired to the Wall early because of the freezing weather and wind at the game.  I procceded to get very drunk for the fun of it and the best part is I barely bought any of my own drinks.  Some days are just great, I let this lady cut in front of my in the line at the bar and she bought me a couple of rounds of beers.  This other girl I was drinking with decided we both needed two rounds of shots.  Finally a friend of mine remembered that I bought him lunch at the begining of the month so he got all the beer for the night.  This left me just buying a couple of beers at the football game and a couple of jack&cokes at the bar.  

This did lead to a issue that is sometimes occurs, the 6am hangover.  After going to bed at 3am after getting back from the the bar and taco bell I went to bed.  At 6am I woke up with a headache so bad I couldn't sleep.  Well two hours, 1000mg of pain killers and six glasses of water made it go away so I could get another hour of sleep before the sunday morning football game.

"event","So today I go in to deal with some windows problems.  Now I'm not the windows admin, I deal with the UNIX/Linux servers, but I also like to help my users if I'm not swamped with other work.  So I go in and deal with the problem, well most of it, and tell them to get ahold of me if they have any more problems.  Everything is fine and it is time to leave for the day.

Well I got ambushed by someone as I was getting ready to leave for the day.  They had some fairly innocent questions about compiling a C file written in windows on a Solaris box.  They needed to know if the carriage return would cause compile errors.  I explained the problem to them and told them I would fire off a simple script to solve the problem, it just eats the carriage returns and I've been using it for years.  However, on their way out they pointed out that someone was going to be buying a new web/file server.

Now I'm the only real admin where I work and this was news to me.  So they are making a server purchase without talking to the person who will end up maintaining it.  A quick conversation with the person making the purchase and I get the following answer, ""I don't want to buy something you suggest, because you are not going to be around here forever.""  *Boggle*  I'm lost on what to say, I don't even know how to take that comment.  Is he suggesting I would sabatoge the whole setup by buying hardware that no one else could work on?  Is that even possible?

After that I just left, I was planing on it anyway but it just made me leave faster.  I am now drinking because I'm at a loss on what else to do."

"event","I decided it was lunch time so I ventured from my office in search of food.&nbsp; Since I work at UNR there are plenty of options, the only problem is I must fight the teaming masses of new students to reach them.&nbsp; Well I managed to wade through the undulating mass of humans to find some very greasy pizza, oh well at least it's food.&nbsp; I then decided that I should eat in my office.&nbsp; So I trek back through all the people and make it into my building, which is almost empty because it is lunch time.

Whew, time to sit down in my office and listen to the peaceful hum of computers.&nbsp; Except that my soda cup breaks wide open three steps from my door, spewing it's contents onto my legs and the floor.&nbsp; Of course the janitor does not show up till 3pm so I am forced to clean it up myself.&nbsp; This required multiple trips to the restroom to collect paper towels, all in a vain attempt to stop the never-ending tide of diet Pepsi.

So now I sit in my office after eating my cold pizza, food gets cold while your forced to clean the floor, without a drink.&nbsp; What a wonderful day!"

"event","I have decided this live journal thing is not all bad.  With that in mind I decided to use it to find other people who may be interested in Mountain Biking in the Reno area.  I ride in about 40 - 50 miles a week in a mixture of road riding and xc riding.  I'm looking for more people to ride with as it sucks to ride alone.  If you are interested in riding let me know.  If you just want to start a discussion of mountain biking feel free to comment.  Here is some information on the local biking community:

And here is my favorite online source for Mountain biking:

"event","Being that I am at work I needed to find something to do.  I decided to play with livejournal.  Besides it is a good chance to rant about some things that have been bugging me lately.

The first thing I want to rant about is RLUG (Reno Linux Users Group) and a NFL game both being on Thursday nights.  Being a general computer geek and linux user dictates I should go to the user group.  But the fact of the matter is pizza, beer and people hitting each other really hard takes precedence over most other activities.  A discussion of UML (User Mode Linux) just is not interesting enough to usurp watching the Colts beat up on the Patriots.  This is just completely unacceptable, why did the NFL have to start taking over more nights of the week.  I was happy spending all day sunday and monday evening watching football.  Now I'm forced to reschedule my other activities around another night of football.  In any case I guess that means no more RLUG until the football season is over, not that it matters as there is only 3 meetings during the season.

My second rant is on video games.  Why do publishers feel the need to announce that games have gone gold three weeks before they hit store shelves.  Back in the old days, read five years ago, games would be announced gold and then hit the shelves on the following tuesday.  Why does it take so much longer now?  As far as I'm concerned the extra time is building negative hype.  It basically makes me give up on the game because I know it's finished yet I am unable to play it.  Of course companies are releasing demos, but they just suck.  Lets take Evil Genius as an example.  The demo was great, it was reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper, but I beat it in 30 minutes.  Now the game does not come out till october first, so when I want to play the game (now) I can't.  When the game comes out I will have moved on because I could not sate the urge to play.  It's negative hype in the worst way, the publishers create an urge to play but they offer no way to fulfill it, this causes a generally bad feeling about the game.  

Finally the disclaimer, I am only halfway serious in everything I write.  Some days I am more serious then others but most days I'm just being obtuse because it keeps me sane.  I welcome any comments and thoughts, both well thought out and stupid ones as all conversation enriches life."

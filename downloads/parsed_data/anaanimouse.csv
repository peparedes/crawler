and not my mother's daughter.
I want to be a cow
and not in love with you.
I want to feel free to feel calm.
I want to be a cow who never knows the kind of love you ""fall in love with"" with;
a queenly cow, with hips as big and sound as a department store,
a cow the farmer milks on bended knee,
who when she dies will feel dawn
bending over her like lawn to wet her lips.

I want to be a cow,
nothing fancy-
a cargo of grass,
a hammock of soupy milk
whose floating and rocking and dribbling's undisturbed
by the echo of hooves to the city;
of crunching boots;
of suspicious-looking trailers parked on verges;
of unscrupulous restaurant owners
who stumble, pink-eyed, from stale beds
into a world of lobsters and warm telephones;
of streamlined Japanese freighters
ironing into the night,
heavy with sweet desire like bowls of jam.

The Tibetans have 85 words for states consciousness.
This dozy cow I want to be has none.
She doesn't speak
She doesn't do housework or worry about her appearance.
She doesn't roam.
Safe in her fleet
of shorn-white-bowl-like friends,
she needs, and loves, and's loved by.
only this-
the farm I want to be a cow on too. 

Don't come looking for me.
Don't come walking out into the bright sunlight looking for me,
black in your gloves and stockings and sleeves and large hat.
Don't call the tractorman.
Don't call the neighbours.
Don't make a special fruit-cake for when I come home:
I'm not coming home.
I'm going to be a cowman's counted cow.
I'm going to be a cow
and you won't know me.

"event","Think about your direct bodily experience in life.
No one can lie to you about that.
How many hours a day do you spend in front of a television screen? A computer screen? Behind an automobile screen? What are you being screened from? How much of your life comes at you through a screen, vicariously while you sit and watch. Is watching things as exciting as doing things? Do you have enough time to do all the things you want to? Do you even have enough energy to?

Do you think for yourself, independently, or do you take others' word for trust? How often do you find yourself repeating something you heard another say without it having any bearing on your personal experience; your personal truth? How many hours a day do you sleep? how are you affected by standardized time, designed solely to synchronize your movements with those billions of other people? How long do you go without knowing what time it is? Who or what controls YOUR minutes and hours? the minutes and hours that add up to your life.

How do you feel in large crowds of anonymous masses? Do you find yourself blocking your emotional responses to other human beings? Can you put a value on a beautiful day? How many dollars an hour salary does it take to stay inside and sell things or file papers for someone else? What will you get later that will make up for this day of your life? How many days have you given to such things? (years?!?)

Do you have ideas or do ideas have you?

Who prepares your meals? Do you ever eat by yourself? Do you ever eat standing up? How much do you know about what you eat and where it comes from? Do you trust it? Of our many time and labor saving devices, do you find yourself with more time or ironically less than ever? is it even possible to ""save"" time?

They're buying your happiness from you

Steal it back
How are you affected by being moved around in prescribed paths, in elevators, buses, subways, highways and sidewalks? By moving, living and working in two and three dimensional grids? How are you affected by being organized, immobilized, and scheduled... instead of wandering, roaming freely and spontaneously? How much freedom of movement do you have - freedom to move through space, to move as far as you want, in new and unexplored directions?
How often are you waiting? Waiting in line, waiting in traffic, waiting to eat, waiting for the bus, waiting for the bathroom - learning to punish, ignore and control your spontaneous urges? How do you feel when you suppress your desires, when you delay or deny yourself pleasure?

D you ever need to be around nature? Have water, leaves, foliage, and animals been replaced by your pet, aquarium, and houseplants?

Do videotapes of yourself and your friends fascinate you, as if somehow you are more real in image then in life? Would a movie about your life be interesting? How do you feel about the non-stop barrage of audio, visual, print, billboard, computer, radio, and robotic voices that guide you though a forest of advertisements? What do they want from you?

How often does your happiness come in conjunction with buying something?

Do you feel like without the mainstream stimuli that you will miss something? Will you? Does it make you tired reacting all the time instead of thinking on your own? When was your last true moment of silence... not white noise but pure silence?

have you ever asked yourself these things?
Do you feel violent impulses?
Do you feel inexorable lonely?
Are you really happy?
Do you ever feel like you are going to lose control?

Do you have the energy to create change?

"event","I hate inconsistent friends who only want me when I can do something for them. I've put up with it for too long...
Now what's going to happen when I'm not there anymore?
If you won't take the time to take a part in my life, why the hell should I take the time to not only take part in yours, but be at your mercy as to when I get to be your friend?
That's bullshit, not friendship.
I know it's hard... oh believe me do I understand.
But you fucked up your own life, threw your opportunities away. 
Don't take it out on me."

Don't like to admit
Don't ask me questions
Don't try to fix it
I won't tell you anyway
Just leave me alone
I've been dealing with it on my own for 7 years, and I'm doing just fine. Still alive, havn't broken down yet.
Forget I even mentioned it
I wish I hadn't

"event","Let's run away to the mountains
Where nothing matters but the weather report.
I'll snowboard all day
And teach lessons for pay
To keep a roof over our heads and the heat on.

I don't care what you do
As long as it matters to you
I'll do anything I can to please you
But be happy, or I'm sorry, you can't stay.

When the sun shines bright, and the weather is warm
When the snow has all gone from the hills
I'll be leaving that day
To follow the freeze
To where snow is falling again

You can come if you please
If not look for me
Next winter, at home, in my cabin."

Cut loose and just say ""fuck it!""....

Forget to listen to yourself...

It only hurts if you let it....

Throw insecurities out the window...

Before you can love someone else, you must love yourself...

Listen to your heart....

Fear is a wasted emotion..."

"event","too many things going round in my head
makes me dizzy
can't pick a direction and walk that way
always weaving indecisive on one side of the street or the other

must focus my brain
see life as a straight red line on the ground
..left, right, left, right...
remind myself to walk
to proceed and move forward
...left, right, left, right...
don't forget
there are more things to come, the line is not broken 

Just remember to keep walking
and hold your head high
You can be happy, and you will make it to where that line eventually stops
just don't let others stand in your way
<em>remember who the hell you are</em>
...and don't forget. you are wondeful.

The world is your oyster (the vegan version of course)
take advantage of it... don't let it take advantage of you."

Thanksgiving break is coming up which means two things: 1.) the amazing buffet at church that I look forward to all year 2.) school will be over 2 weeks after the break. Hells yeah. My semester is almost over. I have loads of laundry to fold and spring schedules to write down. I'm almost done with this misery. I'm damn proud of myself for surviving these four years.

Oh yeah, I have an interview with a representative from Teach For America. Nothing will ever convince me to submit to a 2 year teaching contract and work in the boonies. I still agreed to do the interview because he personally emailed me and asked me to meet with him, saying that someone recommended that I would be a great candidate. hahaha. What BS. I might consider it if they offer enough scholarships or loan reductions. haha. I sound like a horrible person. There's just something about teaching at a school that makes me want to puke all over. 

I love Laguna Beach so much. That show owns me. hahah. Because of the show, Hilary Duff's ""Come Clean"" (i.e., theme song to Laguna Beach) is now one of my favorite songs. My favorite songs as of late are Ciara's ""1,2 Step"" and Black Eyed Peas' ""Let's Get It Started."" heeeeeeeeeheee. Yeah, I am so cheesy. I need to get updated with the songs that are out right now. Sheesh, it's so hard to keep up with the latest music. I try to listen to the radio, but all the stations are just bleh. The most decent station plays ok songs, but they also play a bunch of alternative, preppy music. YUCK. I hate it all with the exception of Maroon 5. Anyways, so I try to listen to some of the ghetto stations but then they're just TOO GHETTO. I enjoy ghetto music (the bumpin--yet less crazy--mainstream stuff), but the hardcore rap stuff gives me a headache. Anyways, I'll write more later."

Currently in law school, with a focus in international law.

5'11. Korean. Strong Christian. A perfect balance of cuteness and masculinity. Kinda dorky. Broad shoulders. Great writer. Reads a lot of books, and has been profoundly influenced by the works of C.S. Lewis, Jonathan Edwards, and John Piper. Loves food, especially sushi. Subscribes to 'The Economist.'

I am a self-proclaimed man-hater, but...I realize I can't escape the innate needs that God has implanted in me (darn, those stupid emotional and physical needs!). I do want a boyfriend. Bah!! 

The qualities I have just outlined for my ideal guy sound sooo wonderful. Seriously, I wonder if a guy like that even exists. I can be flexible on his major(s) in college, of course. The physical requirements, on the other hand, will be difficult to compromise (okay, give or take a few inches of his height...but the broad shoulders are a MUST).

3. Never wear jean shorts 
2. Never wear shorts that come above the knee 
1. Heck, don't wear shorts period (unless you're a white Abercrombie-esque hottie) 

Despite the fact that I don't dig white guys, I have to admit that they're the only ones who can really pull off wearing shorts without looking ridiculous. Asian guys should never wear shorts (in the same way that they should never attempt to grow facial hair). Again, only a select group of white hotties can pull off the scruffy look (see: Ethan Hawke). 

The biggest faux pas for females...clunky, platform shoes. They should be banned immediately!! 

I'm no fashionista, but I do know fashion blunders when I see them.

"event","Wow, I still can't get over how much HOTNESS Brad Pitt exuded in Troy. Dayam. His body is so sculpted to perfection. It's like a greek statue a la Michaelangelo's David came alive. I think Brad's body should be admired by all as a work of art because it really is...really. 

Brad's acting skills, on the other hand, are...well, mediocre. His futile attempts to maintain a ""bad-ass"" facial expression throughout the movie actually made him look funny and translated more to a weird smouldering look on his face. I actually laughed outloud a couple of times just looking at his facial expressions. 

As for the movie itself, it was entertaining, but definitely not Oscar-worthy. Being the nerd that I am, I read over some chapters of the Iliad to verify the overall accuracy of the film (well actually, if I were a true nerd, I would've known this already). Well they did get the basic points down, such as Hektor killing Patroklos, Achilles entering the war to avenge the death of his aforementioned cousin, Achilles' animosity towards Agamemnon, Achilles dragging Hektor's dead body around, Priam's personal visit to Achilles to request the return of his son's body, Paris shooting Achilles foot with an arrow, and of course, the infamous Trojan horse and the subsequent defeat of the Trojans.

"event","I'm trying to cut tv out of my life for the next couple of weeks before I leave for DC. So far, depriving myself of tv has been rather effective considering my productivity meter has gone wayyy up. Let's see...today, I vacuumed, cleaned the kitchen, read the Korean newspaper AND an entry of this Korean QT book, and read more of Dr. E's book (major snooze). Although I've been pretty productive, I've also been bored and lonely out of my mind. It's especially hard that I've started this no tv thing while my mom's out of town this week. The silence in my apartment is really eerie, and I've seriously been so bored that I want to poke my eyeballs out with chopsticks. 

Since my mom's been away, I've been indulging in food, primarily junk food, that I would normally not be allowed to eat. Today's food intake consisted of leftover tang soo yook (that Jae Hee unnie and I made last night), rotisserie chicken, chips and salsa, AND...frozen pizza (gasp!). 

Before I made this no tv deal, I made ONE concession to allow myself to see TROY as my LAST movie before I leave for DC. I must see that movie SOOOON. To see Brad Pitt in all his glory and half-naked splendor on the big screen for 3 hours will be too much for me too handle. :)"

"event","Ahhh! I leave for D.C. in three weeks! There is so much to do and so little time to prepare. I started on Memoirs of a Geisha and I absolutely love it. However, I have to put that on hold for now to read more substantive material, i.e., boring I.S. stuff about politics and the North Korean economy. I don't know jack sh*t and I'm so freaking screwed. 

Every girl has a different image she can play up in terms of her dating game. I've always wanted to portray myself as an independent, hard-to-get kinda girl, but alas, I've realized that I cannot pretend to be someone I'm not. I guess I'll just have to use my good girl, cutesy image (barf), though I have to admit, it is pretty effective. I can usually attract guys during the initial stage of the game, but I always screw things up in the end because I start acting weird and paranoid. Man, it's so hard to pretend to be aloof when I suppose I wear my heart on my sleeve. I really hate that. I can't help it though, and it really shows when I like someone. I either start blushing or get really giggly. Bah!! I'm so freaking naieve. I don't blame myself entirely for it; come on, I still live at home with my mother AND I'm still in Memphis. Gah. Hopefully, my two month stay in D.C. will give me some exposure to the world out there. Sad. 

I spent over $200 on a freaking suit (it's a beauuutiful suit, though...sigh), so now this recent splurge has fueled my drive to work even harder before I leave for D.C. How screwy would that be if I invested more time and resources on trying to look good rather than preparing myself for the intellectual challenges that are before me? If this were the case, I'd end up flat on my face. 

Today I was daydreaming for a bit, and I was picturing how nice it would be to just sit outside on the grass with a guy and just chat for hours. Oh yeah, and this mystery, non-existent guy happened to have glasses on, and he looked damn hot (even though his face was blurred). Sigh...I have such a pathetic life. 

Oh and another good note, despite my half-assed efforts last semester, I still managed to get a 3.6 for the semester, bumping my GPA to cum laude status. Heck yeah! Now I just need to maintain the 3.5 minimum so I can graduate with honors and redeem myself for my pathetic academic performance in high school. My mom can be proud of me this time."

"event","I keep having anxiety attacks lately. Today I had a phone interview with the woman at American Enterprise Institute. The interview went pretty well. She was bombarding me with a lot of questions, and towards the end, some of them threw me off, such as: ""What part of the outlined job duties do you think you would least successfully perform?"" or ""What are your strengths and weaknesses that would aid/hinder your job performance?"" Geez, I didn't expect her ask questions that would get me to pinpoint my weaknesses. For the most part, I think I gave off a really good impression and she said she was impressed by my resume. Sigh, I seem so much better on paper. 

This job is absolutely huge. The scholar I would be working with is compiling articles for his latest book, and all the interns that would be working on it will be credited in the book! I could have my name in some famous scholar's work! Now that I'm familiar with who he is, I see his name in a lot of sources. I even saw his name when I was surfing through magazines at Borders because his article is in the lastest edition of Harvard Review. I'm pretty comfortable with the editing and administrative aspect of the job, but I'm absolutely terrified about the statistical analysis and analytical component of the job. I should've told her that math and statistics were not exactly my forte when she asked me what my weaknesses were. I have a feeling that they will be very disappointed if they hire me. 

I would desperately need divine intervention if I were to get this job. I'm honestly not that smart and even if I really try at something I'm not naturally good at (especially math), I'll do poorly regardless of how much I study. I'm also not a quick thinker and have difficulty analyzing and interpreting data. 

Even recently, my partner and I worked really hard for our presentation. We were going to explain the United States' dual involvement in the Iran-Iraq war using the Realist and Constructivist paradigms. I pretty much came up with the topic, and everything was cool, but once we started researching, it took me forever to really understad the series of events. When I did start finally getting what happened, I still couldn't remember all the events off the top of my head. To make a long story short, I was pretty much reading off my cards for my part of the presentation (plus my evidence was very weak) and my partner (who is a senior and is accepted into law school) knocked everyone's socks off, including mine. It's easy to tell who takes command of the subject because everyone's follow-up questions were directed towards her. I was really depressed afterwards and it was a shocking relevation for me that I'm really horrible about remembering the things I've read. Plus I've always thought that I was good at research, but I was rudely awakened and realized that I wasn't.

It's sad but I'm trying to train myself by reading some articles and summarizing them in my head afterwards. Sometimes I forget what I've read on one page, so I'll have to summarize the text after every page. I feel like I have a learning disability, but I know it's because I'm just plain stupid. [btw, I'm not trying to get sympathy here] 

So basically, I wish I were more capable to excel in things if I try. If this were the case, I wouldn't be so nervous and terrified of getting this really prestigious internship. I think of every event in my life in terms of God's plan, so if I were to get this, I would expect that He has willed this to happen in my life. If this were the case, I would seriously need divine intervention to the point where He'd have to completely change me to a totally different person. The mantra ""In Christ, all things are possible"" kept repeating in my head over and over again, and seriously, if were to get this job, it would take a serious MIRACLE to get my brain working. I'm not being hard on myself or exaggerating about being dumb, but I'm honestly critiquing and admitting my limitations. Sometimes I wish things were easier for me, but unfortunately they're not. 

At this point, I'm not stressing over whether I'll get the internship but because of the fact that I have a good chance of getting it."

My writing was so good at the beginning of fall semester. I was getting solid A's left and right. Now I have papers that professors have butchered all over, with the end result in the mere B range. Gahhh. 

There have been a lot of annoying things happening in my life, but I'm too lazy to type everything out (that's been a recurring excuse these days, huh?). I should address this journal to Henna, my only audience. :) I'm too embarrassed to publicize this stupid thing that doesn't even have any substantive content. Henna just reads this crap because she cares about me THAT much, huh? :) 

Anyways, I have found another reason to get out of Memphis. Since I am the only single girl in the 20's, people at church have been asking my mother if they could introduce me to some guys they know and trying to pair me up with certain gross people within the church (even though I'd rather live in a monastery in Tibet than go for these gross oldie fobs). What do I look like? Some cheap rag that can be tossed around to any guy? If you saw these potential ""candidates,"" you would be appalled too. 

I get myself into all sorts of trouble because I can't think quickly enough on the spot. I got suckered into agreeing to teach this girl how to drive and take her to the DMV to get her license, but I'm going to call her back and tell her I can't do it. This is ridiculous. It's her parent's responsibility, not mine. She doesn't have a car of her own either, and there's no way I'm going to put my car at risk. Oh hell naw, I'm not going to be that nice. There is also this gross married guy in his late 20's who keeps hitting on me in front of his wife. I've been ignoring his comments for the past two weeks but they keep escalating. I'm not taking it seriously because I know he's joking, but his remarks are still disturbing, especially when he's saying all this stuff when his wife is a couple of feet away taking care of THEIR children. The most annoying thing he said to me was, ""I'd like to find a new wife for my son"" and gave me this gross smile. Okay buddy, that was uncalled for and you should not say stuff like that, even if you're joking! Then he proceeded to ask me if I had a boyfriend. Ugh, wth? Annoying incidents like this really makes me want to move away from my church. If they pressure me into teaching Vacation Bible School again this year (for the fifth consecutive year), I am seriously going to scream. Hopefully they'll have it in July when I'll be away in DC. 

OH GAWD...GET ME OUT OF MEMPHIS, PLEASE. Oh yeah, and I'd like to meet a wonderful, intelligent boy in DC this summer. I'm even open to dating *gasp* white boys. See how desperate I've become? Actually, I think any guy in professional clothes who is an absolute genius in political science and foreign affairs will be an extreme turn-on. So yeah, I want to find myself an intelligent boy to have a fling with this summer."

I told her to put a good word in for me. :) It's amazing how someone our age started up this amazing organization that is really starting to take force. I'm really excited about this internship more than ever, and I'm actually pretty confident about getting the job. Let's hope my cockiness won't come bite me in the butt and I end up not getting the internship. However, I really feel passionate for the cause, I'm ready to give it 110% of my effort, I'm personally invested in this issue, and my cover letter and resume were really good. I really hope I get this internship. I'm ready and willing to fight for the movement to end human trafficking. I was reading one of the testimonies of the women, and this one 19 year-old girl was forced to have sex with 1,000 men in a period of 9 months. Human trafficking also occurs heavily within the United States, with the number of victims ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 women and children. Approximately 50% of the victims of the human trade are children. 

Many women from countries of the former Soviet bloc are tricked into ""better"" job offers, and once they agree to leave their homes, the pimps then smuggle these women into other European countries. Once these women are brought into the brothels disguised as cafes, they are forced into serving thousands of clients that are brought in by their ""owners."" The women are forced to parade around in skimpy lingerie in front of the men. When they are not serving their clients, the women are locked in rooms with meager portions of food to eat each day. Many women from Korea are bought into the United States with the same lies told by the traffickers. 

I haven't even begun to read the stories about the exploited children. I'm not sure if I can handle reading those testimonies. For more information, please check out polarisproject.org and their research and activism site at humantrafficking.com."

Dude, I cannot afford a C on my transcript! Btw, he's an adopted Korean guy in his late 20s, so we both feel kinda awkward around each other even though he's married. I think there's more awkwardness on his part, but maybe he feels intimidated by all Koreans from a Korean background. I'm sure that must be weird. Anyways, I'm pissed that I did so poorly on my first two exams and there's no possible way I can finish the class with at least a B. I was hoping to get on the dean's list again this semester, but if I withdraw from this class, I don't have enough hours to qualify. 

On a happier note, I got a 96 on my International Relations Theory test. I love my prof for that class. He's so hilarious even though his facial expressions hardly change and his voice is really monotonous. I think I really like him in that fatherly way, even though he's only in his mid 30s. He's been calling on me a lot during class, and I'm never able to provide a clear answer. I'm not good at analyzing things on the spot. 

Anyways, I guess winter has officially passed. It's so freaking hot now, and the Memphis humidity is starting to kick in. I've already seen two mosquitos. I'm enjoying the warm weather, but the humidity is definitely gross. 

I'm starting to feel majorly unhappy and depressed again, but I'm hoping everything will be put back into perspective after I watch Passion of the Christ. I have a phone interview with my internship advisor tomorrow afternoon. Let's hope I don't screw that up like I did with my other phone interview the other day. Gawd, don't get me started on that. I feel like I screw everything up because I'm either too timid, lack intelligence, or say the wrong things. Anyways, they told me there are internship opportunities at the White House which would be freaking awesome, but I don't think I'm going to apply. The application is due next week, and I have to get 2 recommendations by then. I would look really bad if I made my profs write me recs over spring break when they are frantically trying to grade midterms and turn in grades by the deadline. Plus, the application asks early on if I've voted in the last presidential election and it later asks me for my voter registration information. Ugh yeah, I'm a lazy ass citizen who's never voted for the past 3 years, so I really don't think I'd make it past the first cut.

Oh yeah! On my way to school this morning, I saw a man on a bike get hit by a car! It was awful!!! His bike got flung out to the middle of the road and he was on the ground passed out. The soccer mom who hit him looked freaked out. Dang man. I can be really spacey on the road sometimes, so I hope something like that never happens to me. I still feel terrible about the time I accidentally ran over a squirrel.

That's all I do now, literally. I'm not even looking forward to my Spring break as much because I have two midterms and two papers on the same week when I get back. I'll have to spend half of my break studying and writing papers. Ehh. I'm taking a roadtrip to Atlanta with my mom. I'm sure our trip will consist of the usual activities--getting our hair done, loading up on the Korean groceries, and eating soondae. While watching Making the Band, I realized that I find P. Diddy attractive, and upon closer thought, I've always thought he was cute, ever since the mid-90s. It's another one of those weird attractions that I can't explain. Sure the guy looks ridiculous when he's flaunting his wealth, but I still think he's cute. Anyway...

I'm craving Olive Garden like mad. Those stupid commercials with the unlimited salad and breadsticks get me every time. YUMMMMM. 

I haven't seen Passion of the Christ yet because I'm planning to watch it with the youth group this weekend. I'm feeling kinda iffy about it. 

There are two music videos that I never get sick of seeing--Britney's video for ""Toxic"" and Chingy's ""One Call Away."" hahah."

Professor Copper, 

I was wondering if you have completed my recommendation. Again, thank you so 
much for your time in helping me with the application process. 

Sincerely, 
Angela 


My advisor is so great...a very dull man, but great nonetheless. He has written the most books on Taiwan than any other scholar. His Curriculum Vitae is like 8 pages long.

I have a huge midterm tomorrow. I'm scared."

"event","Bah! I'm starting to get lazyyyy. Spring break is two weeks away and I'm starting to lose motivation and energy. Took a 3-hour nap, and I want to sleep some more. Ahhh. I lost 3 days of lecture notes. I'm SOOOOO UPSET. My lazy ass decided to be really bad about getting the right notebooks for class, so I had to write notes on random scraps of notebook paper. I had them in my room, but I think I threw them away. I need those econ notes! DAMMIT. I also lost notes for my Int'l Political Theory class. DAMMITTTTTTTTTTT. I could borrow someone else's notes, but it won't be the same. Ever since I realized I lost my notes, I've lost all motivation to study. hahaa. Sounds dramatic, but it's true! 

Anyways, another pointless entry. I'm going to take another nap and *try* to study. Sigh, I'm so upset though. 

Oh yeah, I'm going to DC this summer. Mailed in my deposit. The thing is, I still have a shot at the paid internship, but I won't be hearing from them until mid-April. So yeah, I could lose $300 if I decide to do the other internship. Either way, I'm getting away for two months! Wheeee! :) Some of the kids yesterday were like, ""What? You're leaving us?!?"" and I was thinking to myself, ""Oh hell yes!"" 

I really hope to meet some nice guys over the summer. A summer fling would be nice. Anything would be nice, actually. Okay, way to sound desperate, Angie...way to go."

I absolutely love the Vera Wang china collection. Her designs are soooooo beautiful. I know I couldn't ever afford one of her wedding dresses, so I'll just have to settle for her plates and bowls. haha. Then again, I won't be buying china for a looong time since I don't plan on getting married until I'm 26 or so. That's still only 5 years away. SCARY STUFF. I don't consider myself to be a very romantic person (because I find a lot of stuff to be cheesy), but I do think it's a beautiful thought that my soul mate is out there somewhere and is praying for his future wife, i.e., ME. muahahah. I'm absolutely certain that I will marry the guy God has destined for me because my mom's been fervently praying about this for the longest time. I think I'm a special case because I come from a family of divorces--5/6 of my aunts have gotten a divorce, and that's an especially astounding number for a Korean family. So I truly believe God will have mercy on me and answer my mom's prayers. Unfortunately, I haven't been praying much about it, but then again, I'm having trouble praying in general. haha. 

Anyways, I need to catch up with the rest of my classmates by keeping up with the news. I'm trying to listen to NPR regularly, but I usually forget or tune in when they're playing classical music. I need to read the news online everyday, but I forget to do that too. I'm a terrible International Studies major. 

Ok, really need to get working. Tomorrow is going to be another looong day. I have aerobics and volunteering later that night. Henna's Cheesecake Factory entry is really making me crave their food. Memphis has a really limited selection of restaurants. I even looked up Cheesecake Factory locations and they don't even have one in TN!

"event","<P>Ok, these ghetto folks in my neighborhood are really getting on my nerves. It's ironic how I'm getting these really&nbsp;negative,&nbsp;somewhat&nbsp;racist feelings during Black History Month. The thing is,&nbsp;I've lost another package because they keep&nbsp;getting sent to the wrong apartment and my rude ass neighbors have not bothered to return them. I bet they've opened them up, since they don't seem to respect other people's property. I guess I've been spoiled by living in Germantown for so long where white people are always curteous, honest, and really respectful of other people's property. Okay, I know it's not fair to compare the moral integrity between white and black people because I know black people have been perpetually victimized in this country and as a result, they have this ""I don't give a sh*t and I'm just looking out for myself"" mantra. I totally understand that, but it's still frustrating when you have to put up with their rudeness and lack of manners on a day-to-day basis. Even the new Kroger near my apartment is getting flooded with ghetto folks from the other end of Winchester, and grocery shopping is so frustrating now. The ghetto folks are just plain rude and obnxious because they take up the aisles without bothering to move their carts, run into you without saying ""excuse me,"" scream at each other from one end of the aisle to the other, their kids are running around everywhere...it's absolute chaos. I know&nbsp;it's not fair that black people have been continually mistreated and judged, but they're not making things better by perpetuating all the negative stereotypes about them. </P>
<P>I'm sure it's even harder for the educated, non-ghetto black people. This really smart girl in my class last semester was telling us that she actually had some white lady come up to her and say, ""I can't believe you're black. You're actually articulate."" Oooh, that would piss me OFF. </P>
<P>Argh, I'm still mad at my ghetto neighbors though. I lost this really cute hoodie I bought off ebay. I'm having all my future ebay purchase redirected to my school address from now. This is just ridiculous. I'm going to have a talk with the office tomorrow AND I'm planning leaving a note to the postman. Oh yeah, I have gripes about the post office too. Ever since they stopped having to get a signature confirmation (you have to PAY EXTRA&nbsp;for that now), the postal workers just leave it anywhere since neither the post office or the sender is liable for the package unless the&nbsp;addressee paid for insurance. I'm sorry but I can't afford to add another $1.30 to the already jacked shipping costs I have to pay for auction items.&nbsp;ARGH. The only thing that is keeping me relatively calm about my loss is the fact that I paid for this through my Paypal balance that I built up from selling random things in my closet. So I don't totally feel like I lost real money. I'm still pissed though. </P>
<P>Anyways, my schedule is crazy this semester. Mondays are the worst because I have a 3-hour lecture from 6-9 PM and that class feels like an eternity. People usually leave after the break in the middle, but I feel bad about doing that since the prof is my advisor. I gotta keep sucking up to him because I need him to write my recommendations later on. muhahah. Yeah, but that class is absolutely torturous. There are some insanely smart people in that class though, and they bring up some random cool facts. For instance, did you know that if Walmart were a country, it'd be China's 5th largest trading partner?!? Isn't that insane? I think the figure is something like 20 billion. Craziness. Man, my biggest problem is I can't ever remember facts like this. I can't seem to retain all the things I've learned from my readings and classes over the years. These crazy people in my classes can spit out anything in the history of International Relations, even down to the dates. I'm so jealous. Maybe that's why I don't feel like I'm getting any smarter since every semester, I feel like a blank slate and I have to learn everything all over again. I mean, things sound familiar but vaguely remembering stuff doesn't get you ANYWHERE. BLAH!! Life is so frustrating. Why couldn't I have been born smarter!?! I hate how I always have to work my ass off. </P>
<P>On a less whiny note, I'm a semi-finalist for this public policy internship for the government. I would be working for the Federal Aviation Agency. I hope it's some mundane job where I'd do office work and run errands for people. haha. A lot of people&nbsp;actually want to&nbsp;do meaningful things at their internships and get pissed doing stupid tasks like xeroxing and making coffee, but I'd rather do simple stuff like that. I really hope I get it because I could make up to $5,500 for two months. Plus, I'd be directly employed by the government. haha...I was surprised that my resume actually looked substantive after I was done with it. Dude, everything on there is true but it's really deceptive. hahaa...It really looks like I've done a lot, but I really haven't. But then again, I guess that's what a resume is all about. </P>"

"event","My mom pisses me off whenever she expects me to report all my earnings to her (scholarship money+ebay earnings+my lousy $5.50/hour work duty money). These are all random ways that I've made money (very minimal earnings, I might add) so why the hell should I have to give her an account of all my earnings and total spending? I usually put all my scholarship money into my tuition, but I use my ebay earnings and my work duty money for everything else. I think that's freaking reasonable considering I never ask her for money. She feels like I'm acting too independently and creating boundaries between my money and hers. Well damn, I'm in college, don't I have the right to handle my own money? Whenever I remind her that she should allow me to have more freedom considering I'm a college student, she rolls her eyes and tells me that I'm not all that grown up just because I'm in college. How messed up is that? I seriously cannot stand being in her presence, and I honestly mean that. There's a fundamental personality clash between us because supposedly I'm very much like my father and obviously they never got along. It's funny how I'm so much like someone I've hardly ever met. I'm sure there's a biological explanation for that, but I'm definitely not a science person so I have no clue.

On a happier note, I'm loving all my classes. I'm really experiencing the joy of learning, as geeky as that may sound.

Jennifer Aniston is on David Letterman right now. She is so hotness. I'm totally jealous of her perfect body and her absolutely hot husband. I hope her and Brad stay together forever. I also have faith in Nick and Jessica's marriage. However, I don't think Carmen and Dave will last more than 5 years. By the way, their show is not as good as Newlyweds."

"event","My head is pounding right now. I took a 9-hour nap after coming back from the lock-in this morning. I'm actually glad school is starting up soon because I want a reason to be productive again. My biggest resolution for this year is to be more assertive in my classes. Of course, I always say this, but when class actually starts, I get so terrified. I'm really stressed out these days because I'm trying to find a decent internship to do this summer. I found an interesting program to do in China. I hope to end up either in China, Korea, or D.C. this summer. At least I'm a bit more confident when it comes to Asian Studies related jobs because they primarily consist of research. That's a whole lot easier than political science where I'd have to focus on domestic affairs. My advisor might know of some other programs I could do. I think after getting an A in his Chinese politics class, I've proven that I am genuinely interested in China and I am a capable student. We'll see. 

Oftentimes, I really disappoint myself and I sometimes wonder who I really am. I hate how my future is really uncertain right now. People keep telling me I should go to grad school, and a big part of me really does, but if I end up possibly doing missionary work in the future, I don't need to get my masters. I'd feel horrible if I wasted more of my mother's money on something I don't really need. ARGHHHH."

After having a long chat with Angie at Starbucks, I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not that type of girl that can have many (if any) guy friends. Most likely, the guy buddy whom I confide in will ultimately have to be my boyfriend. In the past, I've had horrible experiences with trying to keep guy buddies. The relationship will always turn into this weird flirty relationship and the guy always ends up escalating the flirty jokes to the point where I feel uncomfortable and offended. Maybe I am being overly sensitive, but nothing justifies degrading comments, right? I can't ever trust guys because I never feel respected. Also, I wouldn't mind if this flirting actually led to something, but since it never does, I get more angry. Guys just suck big time. Everybody tells me that I've been getting close with the wrong kind of guys, but considering I always get victimized, I wonder if there's just something wrong with me. In the future, I'm never going to get played again because I'm never opening up to a guy unless we're going out."

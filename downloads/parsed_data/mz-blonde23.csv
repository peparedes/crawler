"event","As I look at the stars at night and dream of what is to be... 
My heart begins to smile for it is you I see...
Knowing that you're close but yet so far away...
I dream of you at night and think about you every day...
For every moment without you seems like an eternity...
I dream of the day we kiss and I can hold you close to me...
So until that day comes you'll always be on my mind...
And I will love you till the end till the end of time..."

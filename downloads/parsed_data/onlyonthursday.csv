Now both Nuri and Gray are angry with me.  And I don't really know why.

Nuri:  ""I don't want to devote my emotions or time to you any more.  Or ever again, if I can have my way.""

Gray:  ""You make me sick.  Unless you seriously reevaluate yourself, I can't see us being friends anymore.""

At first I made the mistake of blindly pleading ""I'm so sorry"", ""please forgive me"", ""I still want to be your friend"".  But who wants friends like that, who shut you down in your time of need?  Who wants friends who instead of comfort offer only a cold shoulder?  

Maybe it's best if I rid myself of friends like that.  I've done nothing wrong, and NOTHING excuses you treating me like that.  I don't care if you're angry because I'm ""obsessed with being 'good enough'"", I am NOT your plaything and you can't kick me around.  I will never come crawling back to you again.  I will not allow you to treat me like crap.  You don't deserve me.

That's the first time in my life I've ever truly stood up for myself."

I only hope I can compare to the popularity Des seems to mustered here...everybody loves her!  No wonder, but still, I hope they like me too.  Damn you, insecurities!

I've got a runny nose and watery eyes.  Stupid allergies, I've been sneezing practically non-stop for the past three days.  Meh.  And I have to do all my horrible, time-consuming homework and study for my pantheon of tests on Monday.

SCHOL IZ 3VIL.  IZ KILING MAI BRANESELLZ.

And then go to Sunday School, which I despise, and then fart around on the Internet more.  And then I have to watch <i>Alias</i>.  ^^  I hope Michael Vartan doesn't die...if he does, I will be forced to commit seppuku by running across the crowded freeway in a giant squirrel suit."

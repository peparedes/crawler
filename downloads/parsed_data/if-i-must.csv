"event","Well at least I warned you....... *inhales deeply*

Right! So most of you know that I have a varied collection of scaly babies, the loves of my life from the tiniest natrix tessellata to the epic albino burm....Who today decided to attempt to take my face off!!!!!!

As always ""quick tel the internet!"" took over..... So I post about the shock  on failbook since he's 9 fucking feet long yup you heard 9ft only a baby.... that coming at you like a force of albino fury can be a little disconcerting and he's never done it before, well to me anyway he apparently bit Dave (the guy we got him from) but he's a bite magnet ... silly sod stil works with DWA annny way I digress as always.

So I post after a little textual sympathy to my plight, shamelessly so.... Do I get any? like FU*K do I more comments going on to some slags profile about how she's going back to work...... well FU*K you failbook friends list!!! time for a mega cull!!!"

"event","Well looks like I'm back again, been far too long to think about since I last did a journal entry but for all of those who actually bother to read this I figured I'd let you know I'm not dead, just busy as hell. 
Today has been one of those retrospective days need things to occupy my mind or it starts to wander. No uni till october, no work this week, no man at home.... what to sink my teeth into I wonder?"

I have been running myself in rings fighting with the government since my (soon to be) ex husband finally moved out of my house! wooo.... they're quick enough to take cash of you but when it's time to cough some up they drag thier heels like no ones business!.... but I spoke to a very nice lady today and she says she's gonna fix it for me, and even laughed when i told her the last person i  spoke to was ""about as useful as a chocolate tea pot""... which was cool :)

Other than money issues everything seems to be fine, Fetish XPO is coming up, my bestest best buddy is doing all the pr... so been, (forgive the pun) roped into doing something.... not even sure what yet but hey.

"event","Well yesterday went fine, had loads more energy today, even though i did feel a bit silly checking the sammiches in boots with my points converter and flicking through the book for ideas for dinner that aren't going to make my mini me go urgh!!! not that she's fussy but it takes her a while to get used to things although she has taken to being the food police rather a little too well... how many points are in that mummy?!... -grumbles-  I've got a bit of a head ache don't know weather that's from sugar withdrawl or just mini me being the food police lol.  Earned 3 extra points today from my walking so i think i'll save that for the weekend... gonna need a bevvy lol...

"event","Ok ... So here's the deal I'm 30 this year! getting divorced and have a younger man on the horizon... Wooo.... it's all good I know it is but I dun wanna be fat and 30... not that I'm huge what's a few pounds between friends?! So I have decided to keep a diary of how i get on.

So me and a certain young lady friend of mine (you know who you are!) lol went to weight watchers last night, it was full of twee and i have to say rather dull people, although a few familiar faces since i work in Evans lol. Even the ritual humiliation of the weigh in wasn't actually that bad and 10% doesn't actually seem alot to loose... well from the terms of day one possative thought. The menu suggestions don't look too bad and as i rather like cooking i think i'mma be ok. But we shall see. There will be regular up dates so watch this space."

It irritates the hell out of me considering I don't percieve myself as a grown up in anyway shape or form.. adult yes, grown up no way!! grown ups are boring.. anyway back on topic.. so yeah I've had enough of them well certain ones anyway.. there are a few good friends i have made but this simply steels my resolve to be the biggest bitch in the world to those i don't like.. then they'll leave me alone.. well there's my plan anyway!"

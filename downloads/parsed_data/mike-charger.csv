What the fuck.

My first honest reaction upon learning of the disaster was ""How bad is it going to get."" My next reaction was ""All my favorite things are going to be fucked up for a bit"".

One of the main reasons I have issues with the world is myself in it. I am just like everyone else I dislike deep down inside. This is due to me being able to experience the world the way they do. However I am not just like everyone one else due to my individual self and how I see things.

My reality.

And in my reality I was ashamed of even thinking of how I will see a spike in model kit prices I love. How my favorite animated shows will now be delayed. How game studios I like will suffer.

I am ashamed of those thoughts. But I also realized that at the same time I was mourning the end of good times for a bit. I was also mourning the loss of life.

I am not a complete asshole.

I am an ass like everyone else can be. But this time I am proud of myself for being human enough to understand what tragedy is. And to for a few terrifying moments place myself in the shoes of someone living there.

Those thoughts scared the shit out of me.

Suffering... Suffering is an old friend of mine. But I swore years ago if I could within my own sphere of influence not to make people suffer. I would do my best to keep people from feeling any ill due to me.

I fail and I succeed. Its a mixed bag and right now I need to focus on happier thoughts before I get depressed too much about this."

"event","At my job last year we had a man come in and shoot a doctor, his mother and himself. The doctor survived, but the man ended his mother's life and his as well.

Some staff are still shaken by this and last week one such staffer suggested the dumbest thing even after we explained the logistics involved.

Put metal detectors at every door.

Me and another officer tried to explain that it would just be a show. True we do our job protecting people as best as possible. But we are there to deter crime, we cannot prevent all crime even though that is our lofty goal.

We explained how the impediment of traffic into the hospital would be such a pain and ultimately cost the hospital money. 

She still insisted that it should be done to make people feel better.

Foolish, foolish people. Just because you feel good about something does not make it right nor safe. We cannot try and search the many many THOUSANDS of people whom come into our campus without major delays.

The only reason airports allow the bullshit that is happening now with the genital groping is because of the TSA. If the government tried to search everyone at anytime in public places it would NOT make us safer and it would only piss off many more people.

But some people, like that stupid lady who could not understand when we said that putting metal detectors at every door would mean officers at every door and that just would not work out too well due to budgetary issues.

Unlike the government, private businesses cannot afford such an increase in the security bill. But oh well, some people will not learn until it is too late."

But the most important thing I consider is my advancement as a person capable of dealing with a crappy life. Crappy by other standards, just fine by my own.

I realized a few things this year:

Being single is the best thing for me at the moment. 

Being a virgin is something I am fine with thanks in part to copious amounts of stress releasing elements found on the Web.

For all the crazy shit I went through in previous years, freaking out and not finding attracting to a whole entire spectrum of the human race for a very freaky weekend was the most interesting thing of all. 

Yea that last item up there was related to Tamika Rose entering into my life briefly and just saying hello while flirting with me hard. Said evaluation of her and other stuff related to her inside my head drove me nuts to no end.

All in all things have improved as far as my ability to handle women but it is still a forever work in progress."

"event","Today began like most of my days recently. I woke up, enjoyed the feeling of feeling a little bit tired. But too alert to do anything like lay back down. And thus begun the adventure that was pre registration.

Tony had left the house earlier to meet up with Mom at BCC about fall registration. He said that the woman helping with financial aid and all that stuff was truly ignorant about the dynamics of our family. How Hiram was living with me, and how our mom had been unemployed for a year. She found that hard to believe, but she should have took note of how...lively our mother can be.

My feelings for mom are better, not any outward hostility or anything. Just, calm thoughts for the most part reguarding her. The same cannot be said for her enemies. 

I mostly waited around for mom to come home, relaxing and surfing online before washing up. Oh and I cut my hair off, it was good to get rid of some of the extra hair on my scalp. 

When mom and Hiram got home, I greeted them both with how we were leaving in an hour for Otakon. Mom without saying hello immediately requested money from me. In a bit of a humorous moment while she had her back turned. I showed Tony different denomninations pulled from my wallet for spending on con stuff. He entusiasticly with a grin shook his head no at the twenties and tens and finally a one dollar bill I produced. To which he gave me a thumbs up.

I gave Mom the ten.

She did not express any true gratitude, just regret that she destroyed our family dynamic. Sure, like a wayward son of Krypton I ended up in an apartment with my brother to look out for. But the last few years have been fun.

So after she left me and Tony left an hour before badge pickup was to start. We headed via train downtown and walked over to the convention center. Only to discover that the skyway that lets you off right at the convention center was broken. Suffered some kind of damage, they should shut the whole thing down but I am not the city.

We diverted and crossed the street back to the convention center and got into the interior of the place promptly and were greeted with a line about a thousand people ahead of us. Luckily we were sent to the barcode line.

The passes I printed out proving we paid, had a barcode which they scanned when we presented ID with them and thus they gave us Badges for Otakon 2010. 

Afterward we snapped a few pictures of the interior and remarked how we did not have to wrap around the building because we got there so quickly. As we left we noticed the beast line forming that we stood in for over two hours last year. 

Forty minutes vs two hours and a half just about is a bonus. After securing our badges and enjoying prepackaged water prepared at home, we ventured forth to the promenade. We ate a lunch of Chinese food and enjoyed cold drinks and Hiram a pretzel. He got me an Ice, Cherry, that turned my lips red but what of it.

We then headed to The Gallery, a multi-level shopping mall in the heart of downtown catering to people of multiple walks of life. 

We looked around in Game Stop, Downtown Locker Room or DTLR, as well as pay less shoes. I secured a pair of shoes from them that are very comfortable and I also discovered that I wear size fifteen tennis shoes and not fourteen wides. 

The fourteen wides were deceptively comfortable but my gut told me to get the larger pair. It is also HARD to find a pay less with size fifteen shoes anymore! I lucked out and made it a point to wear the shoes the rest of the time we were out. To prove that they were the right choice and to stop additional wear on the shoes now reserved for work. I shall polish and buff them for my return Tuesday. 

After securing shoes for ourselves, Hiram purchased a new pair for walking around Otakon in. We then went into Best Buy. I purchased Sonic and the Black knight for twenty bucks and a couple of sharpies.

I need the sharpies to color over the metal safety pins that are holding up the black pants I will wear tomorrow. 

After Best Buy we went to McDonald's and I got myself a big mac meal. Upon mentioning the smoothie, strawberry and banana Tony wanted. They assumed I wanted it with my meal. I feel that the discourteous folks wanted to mock me opening because of my size. But they decided against it and wisely waited for me to pay for my food and get it. And think I was out of earshot to... be ignorant. 

Hiram disliked the shake, saying he had yogurt that was sweeter. I enjoyed my orange Hi-C drink a lot and eventually the remaining half of Hiram's smoothie. I waited until I was outside the restaurant so as not to validate their misguided quips about my weight. 

""Fuck 'em"" is what Derrick or Coby would say. Myself, ""Eh"".

Finishing the drink off before entering the nearby MTA station proper and disposing of it in a trashcan brilliantly placed at the bottom of the escalator. We made haste down to the platform buried a dozens of feet below the street to get a train that was just in time for us.

Acquiring seats, I sat on a seat directly beneath the leaking air conditioner unit above us. I relocated to a seat that invited someone to sit horizontally to my own seat. Little did I realize that two large women friends would sit there. Trapping me.

My knee and part of my thigh rubbed against the one closest to me and I widened my sitting stance to give her as much room as possible. It was a strange experience being so close to a woman like that and touching for an extended period of time.

I am used to being next to someone even touching while riding the bus. But this experience was different because it was part of my inner thigh touching her.

Deride me all you want, I am a gentleman first and a pervert second. I admitted as much to Hiram after we got off the train at our stop. Hiram lamented we missed a bus heading to our home four blocks away.

I however said let us walk. Instead as we crossed a median, another bus heading that way came into the station. He bolted for the next stop next to the post office. I hesitated but eventually lumbered up to the stop to join him.

We departed the bus shortly and then responded to our home. Overall day one was very fun and I scored a new pair of shoes and a game so yea."

"event","After dealing with the various things that come my way daily. I find myself retreating to an old friend. My LJ... yea back in the day I would post daily about the little afflictions life threw my way. 

How it all hurt me, and harmed me, and how everything seemed so bleak. But now, now I have no clue as to what I really want anymore out of anything.

Recently some reading online challenged my view of the world. It makes sense, and that is what bothers me subconsciously. And it also bothers me during my waking days.

Couple that with my inability to knuckle down and try to meet someone and I have a set of problems that are so pervasive that I cannot go a day without it affecting me.

I just do not know what I want anymore. I am twenty-seven this year. I got this LJ about ten years ago as a gift from someone who figured I needed an outlet. 

I do not talk to him anymore, I do not talk to much of anyone anymore. The people I speak to on a daily basis, my friends. Really it is all just fluff, I cannot function in this society. And I do not want to give up on anything.

Life, being happy, anything. Just to spite the folks who would ruin everyone else for their own ends. 

Yea, my bosses bosses who keep wages low. Yea I can make it on what I earn from week to week. But even I know that if I were to be seriously ill I have no one to care for me.

Due to this at this young stage of my life. I already know that once I get too old or too sick, I am going to kill myself or have someone kill me. Better death than to leech off the system. Or end up like one of the elderly people I see day after day at the damn hospital. 

Languishing, not really living. Yea life is precious but what is so precious about it that you let it rot in a living death? Dignity is not even the biggest issue, the biggest issue is would these people want to be left like that?

Furthermore I have real qualms about well, everything. I find myself questioning everything subconsciously now. I feel it crawling at the back of my skull. I want the truth, but I also want to flee screaming from it.

I cannot wrap myself up in lies anymore because I just cannot believe in any lies anymore. Just... ugh.

Rambling again, tends to happen when one of my five times a year major depression episodes. This is one of them, mostly triggered by the anxieties I deal with every day.

And everyone sees that I am hurting somehow. The look on my face that they cannot quite read. I am languishing in a prison not quite of my own making and I have no clue how to get out of it. 

Logic is useless to me I need action. But I am so scared of anything that could threaten the semblance of sanity I do have. 

I want to be in a relationship, but I have no idea how to date anyone. False, I know how, but I have no idea how to approach anyone. 

Fear is my real enemy and well it is kicking my ass.

But this like everything else passes. I can see the way out for everyone, me, everyone. But that is the problem with being smarter than those around you.

Heh, yea I can totally relate to someone like the Flash. Everyone around you seems so...slow."

"event","Well thanks to the bastards whom stole my credit card info. My Renters Insurance second of five payments was missed. My insurance may be canceled now due to this incident.

But those folks I am insured with set it up for automatic renewal using my old credit card info. So, as always, people doing their own thing, has resulted in others suffering, and extended suffering.

But I am cool with this, buzzed even due to the alcohol which I have only consumed once, today, this year. 

Also learned why Smirnoff Ice is so popular. It is sprite, with alcohol... my arms feel heavy and I am just relaxing in front of my computer. 1/3 a bottle of Smirnoff Ice and two wine coolers and I am DONE.

Overall this year was good, did pick up an external 1 Terabyte drive today at Target for a hundred bucks. I am in the process of transferring massive amounts of data to it. Want to free up the three drives inside my computer as far as space so I can defragment them.

But yea, this insurance thing, man if my Policy gets canceled because of those assholes who got my info....

Ugh, well at least I have my health.

Speaking of which. The flu vaccine for seasonal flu I was compelled to get by the job. Yea, it made me sick for seven weeks with minor, on the scale of things, flu infection symptoms. I got it on October 6 and I will NEVER get a vaccination again, for the flu, due to that complication.

I missed out on NANOWRIMO this year because I felt too out of it to focus creatively. I just wanted to get better and devoted my energy to raging, living, and more raging. 

My life so far has been one of pain, and good times. Then more pain. I often find myself wondering how I found myself with the things I have now. And then the answer hits me.

Others, and by things I mean emotional baggage. I want so much to just live without the issues I have, but a part of me longs for the chaos within myself. I have become accustomed to it sadly. 

I have coped and I wish I had not had to cope. But such is fate, we have control on the course, not the direction really. 

Back to my first Blu ray movie purchase, Terminator Salvation."

"event","Christmas was fun, Tony surprised me with two games I had been eying for a while now. And we had a lot of fun with one of them.

Super Smash Bros Brawl. It is a fun title and I am impressed by the single player Subspace Emissary mode. 

That aside, the card fraud issue has been traced in my mind to my shopping earlier this year.

To be clear, I got a letter two months after March. In March I went shopping at a retailer that subsequently had their online credit card database hacked. The hackers or someone with access to a list of numbers, got around to using my card.

Fraud protection as a result kicked in and thus I had to get a new card with new numbers obviously. Issued to me Wednesday before work.

The last two days involved shopping on my part and relaxing. I also padded my PS3 collection with two new additions only costing 20 dollars.

The latest Ratchet and Clank game. And the last Spyro game. I am looking forward to the new Spyro game but it will have to wait. I need to finish up Starforce 2 for one thing. And FF8 finally since I did download it from the PSN to my PSP.

Here's to a new year with new possibilities."

"event","Holy fuck shit cock sucker!

My card number was acquired by someone, whom is now using it to make purchases online. However my bank's fraud protection kicked in after unusual purchases were made and my card was denied yesterday.

I was wondering what was going the hell on when I was unable to use my own card yesterday. Also, why my payment to Verizon for my phone bill was unusually late being posted to them.

To summarize, my card is deactivated, however, this prevents the thieving assholes from using my card info. As a response to this event, I am wiping my goddamn windows installation once I acquire a new HDD from newegg using paypal at work. 

I am getting a new card today at work, so yea I am stopping by the credit union to do so. 

I suspect it was the rude, did not see to me immediately and ignored me, clerk at Target from last Thursday. Or one of the clerks from Radio Shack.

How can I suspect these people as well? Easy, I do not do much shopping outside of my normal routine. And the guy at Target made it a point to look awfully hard at my card, even flipped it over, did not need to check the signature really asshole since you got a look at my ID and my name is printed on the card.

So my instinct is telling me that the clerk at Target was good for this mess. Gotta watch out for these assholes.

Why do criminals do such foolish things, ugh pisses me off. Your purchase of two months of WOW time and other such purchases will not go unpunished."

"event","I love Hulu.com, but with them planning on a pay model for a site that earns money via subscriptions, and its programs already paid for via aired commercials. It seems greed is going to ruin a good thing.

How...predictable of those assholes.

Hell I turned OFF my ad blocker program and script blocker program for sites I visit that are safe and that I like. Granted Hulu is set up to not allow videos to play with ad blockers on. Still, the commercials they show, some time, actually get me interested in things.

The new red dead redemption long form commercial rocks, and I am interested in picking up the original game now and giving the sequel a try as well at some point.

In any case, my brother got his cell phone replaced, I just spent like twenty five dollars online ordering him an eight gig micro sd card for the phone, and a link cable so he can put music and videos on it.

I love my brother, and I care deeply about him. It is one of the main reasons I took him with me when we fled the unplesantness.

In any case, I recently have stopped having severe depression attacks. My mood upswings to good and not bad for the most part.

Why?

Well for the last few years I had deep depression attacks at least once every three months. At worst, once a month. 

Within the last two months however my daily and weekly mood has altered a bit due to my being on my diabetes medication for type two once again.

Surprisingly, having my sugar in check does keep my mood better regulated. Sure all the hella walking I do, seven miles or more daily patroling at my job, sometimes ten, and the proper eating and all that jazz helps.

But now that I have a doctor again and pills. I am okay.

Like with anyone, things could be better. And as I have gotten older, I suddenly realize how much Calvin and Hobbes rocked.

I read it as a kid when it was still in print, up until it vanished from the paper. I never got the jokes then, but now as an adult I get it.

As I get older certain things are sliding into place in my brain. My observational skills have improved due to me coming to terms with my anxiety. 

Yea it is why I sweat and why I sweated so heavily during Otakon. I have anxiety issues due to the bullying I endured as a young man. 

I know people say I should get over it. But honestly, like Bruce Wayne and his parents, as the years roll on I can feel better about it. But the pain is still there inside of me. And the anger at my lack of power, and at the lack of caring on the part of my teachers and my own mother. 

Mom.

Thanksgiving was awesome, went to mom's place for the first time and I must say for a seventies era apartment complex. It is quite nice.

I ate and ate, and my brother even managed to snag a whole pie. I snagged a two liter bottle of ginger-ale.

All told I had fun spending time with my mom. Also they had the Michael Jackson thirtieth anniversary special from ten years ago on that night on BET.

I did not watch it with my mom, however Tony did all those years ago. But watching it last Thursday made me realize the man is gone.

I really loved Michael Jackson's work and he truly was the best entertainer to come along in a long time.

It also came to light officially that he worked on Sonic 3 after all. People had theories for years that he did work on the soundtrack for the game. Hell, three years ago a dude posted a video on youtube about the similarities between certain songs in the game and MJ's music.

Well it turns out he did work on the game, but hated the sound capabilities of the Sega Genesis and did not want his name associated with it. Which is why they altered the soundtrack, but the game still has some of his music in it.

Which makes me want the DS collection reissue more now than ever."

I found his baby picture, work ID, giant card, prom picture and his social security card. No wallet itself. But the stuff was scattered about the ground in the alley.

They got him for ten dollars, which was his work bus fare. However our mom is here right now, and now she is talking to him in the livingroom. In all honesty I have to wait and see about how Tony is going to replace his phone before I even bother to get involved in the replacement process.

I got the voice-mail and immediately called home once I found a phone. He had saved up 200 dollars to get his Cricket phone. And had purchased it just yesterday. He got jumped while walking right up the stairs to our apartment. 

Four guys got him on the ground and wailed on him then ran through his pockets. They got his wallet, id, everything, and his new phone of course.

I wish he had not decided to use the phone while walking home. I wish he had gotten a cheaper phone. Now I have to go ahead and gladly replace it with my own money with a phone at least a hundred dollars less.

I thank god he is alright and I pray that me and him do not obsess over this too much and become even more jaded at life.

Too much shit has happened in these last two years. And it all can be traced to our mother getting hooked on crack and splitting up our family.

If we were at the house. And my mom was not a former crack addict. None of this would have happened.

Fucking mom, fucking Voline Owens. That lady ruined our family. And if my mom was not stealing my bro's child support. He would not even need the part-time job at Giant!

"event","I may not have mentioned it before. But ever since I got my apartment last year, the United States Postal Service has lost three of the packages I have ordered. Last Christmas two from Ebay never showed up, and just recently around the end of September, I ordered on the 18 and the package was due the 27 or 28. My copy of Persona for the PSP never arrived.

The tracking info says otherwise, but the Postal worker is to leave a note, which they never do but more on that in a moment. The tracking info says delivered and that the time was 2:27.

I was not home at that time, so how the fuck could they deliver it to me? Once or twice a package was just dropped at the apartment door. And a couple of times a package arrived for me from overseas however no delivery attempt was made and a few weeks later a visit to the local Postal Office would yield it.

I am fed up with the piss poor service I have gotten from the guys with a fucking monopoly on deliveries around here. How am I supposed to order things I want online when the USPS has issues getting things to me?

During my first year here, I had a postal carrier who would get to our apartment block before I left for work. There were instances when packages I had to go get, without an attempted delivery note, would not be dropped off on days when I was home.

Why do people do their jobs so poorly? It makes me want to work even harder at mine to compensate to show that someone cares somewhere.


And that is why I am so stressed. It seems no one gives a damn about others feelings or doing their jobs properly.

If you are bored, focus more on your work as opposed to being bored. Work by its nature should keep you busy enough to not worry at all about being bored. 

Especially being a postal courier. I mean you are sorting and delivering mail, how can you be bored doing that? Other things on your mind? Drop them and get your ass back in the zone.

"event","I stopped making entries in my journal on the regular due to a few facts. The main one being that I do not want to remember certain things, and utilizing my journal as a memory bank kind of defeats that purpose.

However, I should start once again writing and thus my journal will be the starting point. 

I have a new doctor now after four years without one. Her name is Dr. Bennett and she prescribed to me metformin in 500 mg and a blood pressure medication as well. The metformin was what I was on years ago.

But it stopped working for me, and the hoops I had to jump through to get treatment made no damn sense considering the other doctors I had. 

So I took a pill after eating yesterday at six. At around ten fifteen last night I ate one candybar. 

After 11:45 I was suffering something fiercely. Metformin in me causes me to have diarrhea which is a common side effect I only learned about years after I initially started taking it at 19. However with me, it works like this:

I eat take the pill and for four, maybe six until I get used to the drug again, hours I cannot eat ANY solid food. It causes me to have diarrhea something fiercely. I was fighting the urge to go the whole bus trip home. And the subsequent walk home.

This will force me to lose weight seeing as how it forces me to cut back on snacking. 

Anyway I have to start eating breakfast/lunch at twelve to one, and eating lunch at six thirty. That way I have a few hours in between meals to hopefully avert the diarrhea.

Oh and my gas is back as a result of me taking this stuff. I had gas during my use of it, and I was gassy as a mother yesterday after getting back on it. So yea, meh.

"event","I spent a good forty minutes going over one of the major plot points commenting on a forum of sorts for Gundam 00.

I think my theory is right on the money about how the show is progressing. I have always been good with analyzing a situation given just enough info, to say the least. 

Might as well cut and paste what I posted here for all prosperity.

Spoilers about the show, which is epicly good, abound so do not read below unless you have watched Gundam 00 up until the latest episode.






****

Okay, as far as Setsuna's ""mutation"" as I am going to refer to it, yea evolution is a kinder word but I am talking about this from a cellular standpoint. I am going to try to explain what I see going on within the show as far as him and humans in general when it comes to Aeola's plan.

People tend to forget that everything around us emits radiation of some kind or another. Be it harmful at times or beneficial, Sunlight is beneficial radiation when exposed to just enough of it. Our bodies process it into Vitamin D with enough exposure. However when some people are exposed to too much of it over a period of time it can manifest as cancer that could kill you.

The topological decay, or simply put, the exotic matter within true GN drives as it breaks down releases nearly limitless energy. In the form of radiation that can be visibly seen near the source of it! The half life of this material must be extraordinarily long.

Thus why folks refer to true GN drives as having nearly inexhaustible energy. But you have to remember that GN drives are reactors, and reactors mean radiation which is bad normally.

With Pseudo GN Drives, the particles they release are not beneficial at all possibly when introduced into the body via an injury. We have all seen the results of this when it comes to Louise and Setsuna and maybe even Lasse.

With true GN drives, its a different story. Also I think I finally figured out why when the Gundams were on Earth they were always releasing GN particles when not in combat from their containers.

Not for stealth purposes, no, it was to evolve humanity! 

Think about this, radiation is known to cause cellular mutation, if exposed to radiation before your cells have a chance to fully mature or one has a chance to reach adulthood they become permanently altered if not given a chance to repair themselves from the cellular damage.

Expose a child's parent before they were born to radiation, and before their bodies have a chance to repair it. The damage to their chromosome will be permanently passed onto their child when born. We have all seen the results of this if you look at pictures of some children born in war zone's where depleted uranium rounds are used.

The dust, or particles, of said material saturate the land and infuse everyone in the battle zone with low levels of radiation that does not go away as long as you live there. Sometimes never even if you do leave the area, because it settles deep within the bones of the human body to nearly undetectable levels.

The same can be said with GN particles. Setsuna has soaked up so many of them while growing up, it affected the way he grew. He became a Gundam pilot at fourteen at the earliest, a child as even his fellow pilots recognized.

From then on he spent years near an active GN drive. Why this has not effected the other pilots? I probably has, but CB without Veda cannot do the simulations of just how it has effected them.

Ribbons obviously knows what is going on with Setsuna. And why he want's 00 so badly. Not just because of its abilities, but because it can effect human evolution.

Also, before I end this long post, I think I get just why the Innovators need Veda for ""The dialogues to come"".

Innovators, or Newtypes, are telepathic. Imagine a planet full of newly born children whom have been altered by GN particles and can use them in conjunction with quantum brainwaves to speak to people and one another.

Imagine if they cannot turn this ability off like with Marie and Allelujah as children? Luckily those two got along and their were special conditions to consider. However with others whom did not want someone hearing their personal thoughts all the time the confusion would be horrendus. 

A literal thought mediator would be needed, and what I am getting at is what if *Veda* can actively intercept in real time human thoughts transmitted via quantum brainwaves? What if Ribbons plans to lead humanity by controlling the newly born Innovators by altering their thoughts and feelings with Veda?

A person without a strong enough will to block the outside influence would become easy prey. Regene and his twin are on the same frequency because they were made to be on the same frequency. So its hard for them to block one another when in close proximity.

What if Ribbons wants a massive die off of old humans, he has hinted at this, so that they breed replacements whom would be born as Innovators?

It makes sense, since he has an extended lifespan, he *would* see the birth of a new humanity, one that he would control as long as he lived.

My other theory, yea I am on a roll today bare with me. Is that Veda is for extra terrestrial contact purposes. Hear me out on this. The last Gundam series touched on alien lifeforms with that whole space whale thing that was not elaborated on at all. 

Well what if Aeola predicted that evolved humans would be needed to interact with extra terrestrial presences along with a quantum computer of unparalleled power to mediate i.e. translate in real time what humans and this alien species would say to one another.

That was my first theory before this episode came out and gave me more ideas to run with. And honestly I think my second theory is right on the money. However, Aeola scares the hell out of me as a fictional character.

Why? He conceptualized a hell of a lot of technology and genetic manipulation theories that were proven true. One man! He even went as far as to draft a plan, plans rather, on how his theories would be used.

Created a secret organization that used funds generated by colony building; which involves mining asteroids for raw materials which includes precious metals. With the full intent of using said funds to build mobile weapons that would speed along human evolution.

Setsuna said it best when he said that his Gundam was not meant for war in season one. But change, change on so many levels."

I installed Fallout 3 today, and I must say after running some maintenance on my rig. The game is a nice way to see just what my SLI powered rig can do.

I am very impressed with the game, the graphics, presentation, its really immersive. But like Resident Evil one, I am without ammo and left with few items I can barter with for provisions.

Like previous Fallout games, I can see this one absorbing a lot of time... if I let it.

So far Valkyria Chronicles has me firmly locked in for the long run. Finally, a game that will have me see it through to completion after so long.

Of course Star Ocean on the PSP has me locked in too. Even though I know how its going to end since it is a remake after all.

Still, love how they overhauled everything and made the characters look better than their SNES interations.

As far as my personal life goes, nothing much bothering me except for the fact that our uniforms at work will be upgraded sometime this year.

She epically fails as a mother.

Today I renewed my state ID card, did not even have to take a whole bunch of stuff with me. I just needed my old expired card, and they quickly issued me a new one. I was not in the DMV for no more than thirty minutes max.

Did not even have time to break out the PSP or the DS to pass the time. They were that damn quick.

I went to Mondawmin and did some shopping. Got some food into me and while I was eating some teenage girls skipping class came into the carryout place.

Once asked me for some of my food, and I replied after her third time asking with: 

""You are too old to be harassing me.""

She replied with:

""Shut your cute butt up.""

...

Or something like that.

But she used cute, while insulting me, its strange how my weight loss has affected my apeal to others.

Regardless I kept my cool, mostly stunned that someone actually admitted I was attractive on some level. She then promptly started cracking jokes, saying my glasses are coke bottle thick, no my supervisor's were that thick as far as the lenses at that point.

And he is the only person I have ever met with lenses that thick. My own are thin and small frames unlike what I wore all through high school. 

Its funny how after all the crap I went through, today is the day I honestly can admit to myself I am over High School.

The trauma has been healed, replaced with a general dislike of everyone on some level for being selfish and ignorant of others feelings.

This includes myself. 

But the thing is, I also care about and love everyone else too on some level. Some more strongly than others, though my own mother is on my shit list now along with various politicians and etc.

Does not mean I hate them, I just feel indifferent about them.

"event","I am now going to rant about folks who have no clue about PC Gaming. Is the accusation that I ""have to upgrade all the time"". That is wrong, and I hate hearing it coming from folks who have no clue about maintaining or building a computer. You are not a peer of mine, especially if you have no clue about building your own system. So your comments are generally viewed as being weak by me. 

If I was to say all PS3 owners have to keep upgrading their system hard drives due to mandatory installs on some future games. I would be right, especially if you own a lot of PS3 games.

However when a PS3 owner tells me I have to keep upgrading my computer, that is bullshit because I do not have to. I have more than a terabyte of storage, two gigs of ram, and I intend to bump that up to three anyway; a Six Gigahertz processor, and a video card that kicks ass.

I do not HAVE to update anything, however MR. PS3 owner. Who has to install every game to increase loading times, even games without a mandatory install, you will run out of space if you have a small HDD.

What's that? You can uninstall and install games over and over? True, but its wasting your time isn't it? PC games, take half an hour or less to install in a lot of cases. If you want to play now, do you have the patience to wait?

Oh and that whole ""I have a PS3 as an entertainment center"" that's cute, spending six hundred dollars when you could have spent only four to five for an entertainment center PC. You wanted an all in one deal right?

That's understandable wanting a gaming system and a PC. But that is where I am proven right, your using your PS3 as a PC entertainment center! So it has more in common than ever with a PC. The only difference is you can NEVER update the Graphics or memory on the thing.

On top of that the processor will be outdated in a couple of years. Which leads me to my main point, you cannot evolve your system, while I can. And thus, that is why I ignore comments about PC's for the most part from idiots who cannot even build one.

And who wants to uninstall one game only to install another? What is up with that anyway? I thought consoles were supposed to be better than PCs? But more and more they behave like their bigger cousins. Albeit with weaker processors and graphics cards. 

A poor man's gaming rig, or a mass marketed toy intended for slightly more than just video games, but mostly just for them.

Furthermore I own more console games than PC games. This is because I play for fun, and generally consider myself a game fan and not a system fan. If you publish a game, much like a book, that is not crap I will buy it."

"event","There are two people whom I know personally who have the misguided conception that PC gamers *have* to update their machines every single time a new game comes out.

What?

The guy I know from work Shawn, says that ""Your not getting the full potential from your game unless you upgrade.""

My old friend Andre says that PC gaming is dying and so is Shawn. They both say consoles are the way of the future and that PC's do not get the same amount of games as consoles.

The conversation with Shawn started lastnight over Capcom's decision to release across multiple platforms, including the PC.

He was upset, just like Andre, that as a result the consoles would not get the best version. And that games would have to be ""downgraded"". Meaning that they would just port the PC version to consoles instead of having teams work on different versions of the same game only for different systems.

I mentioned that you do not have to update your PC, and then he asked me can you play crysis without any problems.

I said it does not matter but I can play it without any problems, I may have to run it without everything turned fully up.

He hit me with the whole ""You have to upgrade to get the full experience"" bit multiple times to justify his whole console whoring.

The thing is this, the guy is marginally a gamer by my standards. You cannot support the industry if you only own less than thirty games over the life of a system.

Yes you should not spend your money wastefully on every game that comes out. However are you TRULY getting your moneys worth by only buying select games after paying six hundred dollars and three hundred dollars for the PS3 and Xbox 360 respectively?

No you are sadly not!

The two of them are elitist assholes, I know the type well and their point of view is always right to them.

The truth is I like PC gaming as much as console gaming. And if you read between the lines you realize that Consoles are where RPGS are at most, along with handhelds which is why I have a DS and PSP, PCs have exclusive titles that rarely get ported over to consoles, and PC games drop in price much faster than console games.

When I mention this to Shawn, he says the savings only goes towards upgrades for your machine, so in the end you end up paying more.

The fact that you do not have to upgrade, I kept mentioning it, kept being put down by that whole ""Your not getting the most out of your PC game then!"" bullshit statement.

Fine, whatever, if you were so keen on console games being so fucking awesome, how come I own more than you?

Fucking assholes who are unwilling to see others point's of view.

I also hate the fact that when I mention something along the lines of expense, Andre and Shawn both like to point out ""They were not made for you, they were made for other people."" When it comes to consoles versus expense and etc.

What the fuck kind of logic is that? Shawn was saying that Capcom was a business but as a result their games would suffer from being ported from PC versions.

The sad truth is these two are diluted fools. Consoles are PCs you jackass, Sony's Playstation three is the most powerful fucking home computer you can buy out there right now for only four to six hundred dollars!

I cannot build a gaming rig with that much processing power for less than a thousand unless VERY lucky.

The reason ports can occur is because of consoles utilizing, gasp, computer parts! The fact that the PS3 can run other operating systems on it is a testament to this fact! Hell he even mentioned, Shawn, to me that some hackers got the PC version, which is superior jackass, of DMC4 to run on the PS3.

The sad fact is they hate the fact that if I choose to do so, I could upgrade my machine to run anything, while their consoles are just stuck! 

Expensive? Hardly, videocard prices have dropped like mad the last few years. I could upgrade to run in SLI for only about a hundred and twenty dollars or less at this point. And I think I will.

Then my machine will chew up anything and spit it out. 

Just had to get that off my chest, I have always, and will always HATE elitist thought patterns in others.

Shawn is also a MAC book owner as well. That's very telling too."

And another eight hour stint, got to see a hell of a lot of Hurricane Ike coverage Saturday.

This week I have another six hour stint down there on Thursday. I also need to ask about overtime for Saturday. And this time I will get to the office early to track down Valentine.

I do not have to pay the power bill due to a 160 dollar credit that the state got the BGE folks to give its customers.

Why?

Well this morning I set my alarm clock to wake me up at 8 o'clock so I could place a very important phone call to work about overtime on the day shift.

Since moving out, I have had to work at least one day of overtime for the purpose of buying my brother groceries and ensuring that I have enough money to pay my bills.

I felt embarrassed at first about it, but the more I think about it why the hell should I considering there is a woman on my shift burning up the OT on the day shift by working five days a week?

Fuck that, its unfair to others that they let her flout the rules that an officer can only do about three days worth of OT. 

What about others who need cash? Or have younger brothers to take care of due to mothers becoming addicted to crack?

I felt bad at first because the Operations Manager Mr. Valentine said that they had no overtime available on the day shift, but would put me on the schedule. 

Now I see why my former supervisor Ms. Hawkins made it a point to mention how one person should not hog the overtime.

Even my friend Derrick does a heck of a lot of overtime on the day shift. And if that isn't proof that his lifestyle could not be supported without overtime, I do not see what else could be.

Too many people live like him, or maybe not, he might be saving up for something big. But he works his ass off, and the same goes for Ms. Lemon, however, she lives with someone else whom works, so I cannot see how she could have money issues that require her to work more than five days a week.


I do not know why I felt so bad at first, it was maybe shame, but honestly after reviewing everything mentally. I did the right thing in calling and asking for the work needed to support my brother.

So yea looks like I will not be able to work more than two days of overtime this month unless I work the nightshift on Wensdays.

Oh and my supervisor is an idiot, he knows my situation, or should know it, and acts like he could not give me overtime for today.

"event","After more than a month and a couple of weeks without internet, hell it was more than likely two months. 

I am back online and loving every moment of it. But first a bit of info about Verizon.

The first guy they sent to aid me in my problem, proceeded to fuck up royally about fixing it. He came into the apartment, checked all the jacks, quoted some shit about how the state has a law stating that an apartment needs one working jack.

Proceeded over to the rental office where it was discovered that he knew jack shit about getting the hookup right.

However he gave me, supposedly, a free jack replacement and an additional phone jack as well that is closer to my computer.

Put in an emergency call for service he did, and two days later I get Verizon guy number two.

So this guy shows up and takes a look and says ""We are going to have to charge you such and such to get this done."" I balked and went to the rental office again to see what was up with them paying. But that was after I told the guy to go and do nothing.

Later on, I called Verizon again and got a third guy to show up today at Eight O'Clock. He did the job right and it did not involve anything other than him connecting some wires that the first but most assuredly the second guy could have did when he was here.

For FREE!

My phone plan covers that shit, I pay inside wire maintenance, and other such additional fees to ensure that. The persons on the phone when I called Verizon acted like my payments meant nothing and that additional money would be needed to the tune of a hundred and ten to forty to start and ninety dollars per hour after that.

In the end it seems that corporate greed worked against them I hope. I have yet to get next month's phone bill. But rest assured, if I came out on top, I will post something about it.

The upside is my connection in the apartment is closer to what I actually PAY for! The wiring was replaced somewhat by the third guy I got to come out. And now, now I have a connection that is about 2,500 kbps instead of 1,500 kbps!

The wiring in the house I lived at obviously was old and degraded. So I came out on top after waiting so long.

The one whom will be happy the most is obviously Hiram since he can finally get back online after bitching about being unable to do so for the whole summer."

After that I with the aid of my friends will move all my stuff into my new place. 

The last few weeks have been interesting, I did my new budget and for me to be able to live without worry about bills like I do now. I have to work sixteen hour days once a week, this will be done on Saturday, working from 8 in the morning till 12 at night. 

This way I will be able to save up for what matters most and survive and take care of my brother. 

My mom plans on moving before the end of the month as well. With that bitch whom caused all this stuff to happen.

Whatever, just as long as she gives me Hiram's child support money so I can feed him. Speaking of which she is overdue to give me his money today. Looks like the crack addiction does all the talking for her now, even though she denies she has a problem, she has a problem."

I will at the age of twenty-five have moved on in my life under less than desirable terms. I wanted to move after Hiram was 18. That way he could be a High School Graduate and able to go on and do other things with himself and his life.

However things may be in the future, however lonely I may get.

None of my old supervisors sucked as much as this guy does. Then he later on met with me in person after our phone call conversation mentioning that a guy above him would be ""Changing MSO responsibilities.

Uh huh, veiled threat anyone?

Fuck you Dorsey, fuck you. It is not my fault your forty five year old ass cannot type. Learn how bitch, otherwise why did you take the job in the first place? It is apart of your responsibilities to file reports!

Only a couple of rides were still there from its Wild World days, back when I first went over sixteen to fifteen years ago.

I took hundreds of pictures throughout the day and I can safely say the camera case I purchased for my camera was worth every penny.

I kept it securely on my belt and made it so easy to move it around on my waist as I got into rides and sat down and generally moved about the park.

We were there for about four hours inside, not counting the time spent eating before we went in.

In short I spent like over the last two days a hundred dollars or so. But meh me and my brother needed it you know?

I will post the good pictures on Flicker and my brother has a few shots he wants to post to MySpace.

Including one of him with Foghorn Leghorn, that Looney Tunes rooster, who was played by a woman I think.

Conversations I have been subjected to due to my lack of a music player since last Thursday are as follows:

Guys gential sizes by two hispanic girls. 

Two girls just talking VERY loudly across from each other on the bus. This was unneeded because they could have sat next to each other and talked a bit more quieter about tattoos and where to get them and misc.

Children crying.

I have four hundred dollars from not paying my mom rent due to her addiction, I am going to take two hundred of that money and replace it. I have searched upstairs and found nothing.

My mom nor Voleen Owens or any one else downstairs will cop to stealing my property. I should have not had it sitting out to recharge, but, its insane, why take something you KNOW I will know is missing?

Where I had it sitting, it could have fallen into the trash, but its highly unlikely. I left the house to do some shopping, came back and I could not locate it.

It was out in the open, but fuck it, time to order a new one.

In other news, my supervisors are both out sick at work. One last night busted himself up after crashing the segway into a concrete pillar.

His upper lip was penetrated by his teeth, he broke his left hand, he also needed a cat scan as well as x-rays last I heard.

So stitches and a broken bone as well as scrapes. The man is all fucked up due to his stupidly riding the damn thing at night! It has no headlights so...he did it to himself.

My Lieutenant fell down a flight of stairs and fractured his leg and knee or something. Its all messed up because the guy they will get to be in charge will be a fucking idiotic asshole.

Issuing stupid orders to placate ED staff and the like. Meh whatever.

But I will have to make due with my brother as a roommate until he becomes eighteen and can move out on his own. 

I can certainly see how I can fit the contents of my room into the living room/bedroom area of said Studio Apartment. 

And how I can fit Tony's computer desk in as well, but as far as sleeping arrangements, that will be a tough one.

We might have to take turns using the bed, I get it one day, he gets it the next and so on and so forth.

I also will not have the luxury of looking at ""educational"" material online since I will not be by myself.

Why am I doing this?

My mom admitted to me two weeks ago she is on crack cocaine and I am in the process of saving up and moving out.

My life as I know it, is totally fucked because of her admission.

She still works, but I know she is still on that stuff and is LYING about not doing it anymore. I tried to talk to her Friday about it, and she totally blew me off and ignored me.

My time is limited due to my work schedule, here I am at nearly two in the morning sitting up writing a journal for the sake of keeping sane. Knowing all the while that two addicts sleep downstairs.

My brother's emotional state is totally fucked up, so is my own. 

I will be honest, I have been having homicidal thoughts since the admission. My mom has totally and wholly fucked me up emotionally.

I also happened to have videotaped the whole crack addiction incident.

Yea, thank you Sony Cybershot for having a video function.

I am going to post said video to you tube so the whole world can know my pain.

Its time to make this public, she is not doing a damn thing to get help. I want to get out of this house with my brother before I kill the person who got her addicted. 

Or my brother does.

So its time to take action, and starting now I will post an entry daily as a means to ease my inner turmoil.

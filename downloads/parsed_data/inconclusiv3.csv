"event","It is in fact possible to be purely happy, at least for me. I love people so much. Just in general you know? If I didn't have so many ""friends"" (the quotes are not to offend but more to say that people who aren't my real good friends are included in this statement), I would realli be hurting now. I think it sucks that me and bethany are broken up but its different now because I am not responsible. I flirt with everyone because they make me happy but I don't particularly like any of them enough to take action. Couples are still cute to me. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally jealous cause I want someone to pay attention to me. Well believe it or not I actually have something better to do but write in this so I won't. lol I am so single woohoO!"

"event","So a lot of things happened today. Nothing that important I guess but oh well. Soo friday went quick. I was very interested in both english nd spanish because it was Constitution Day today and the teachers were supposed to talk to us about it. Ms.Hunter was telling us about the Patriot Act, which I am totally already SO MAD about lol. Ms.Chapman talked more about how the goverment infinges too much on our personal lives. She also brought up the point that it is in fact unconstitutional to require the teachers to talk about the constitution on this day but blah blahh blahh lol. Going out of order heree, I had geometry first and we moved tables nd Im sittin with alex now..who secretly doesnt like me sumtimes but shh lol. I had 1st lunch today, I observed many people. Im observant today..mhmm. OH YUH! (so ADD i am i knoo) but I made cupcakes and I swear I planned to give liz like three cuz she rocks and she likes cupcakes. BUT I DIDNT SEE HER!*surprised* Oh well so..No official GSA tuesday..someone should make my tuesday rule. Ugh I like anime club..its fun. SO skip to afterschool..I ate like 3 more cupcakes (Im a fat kid). I havent found out which day Iv been assigned for challenge day..but if its friday someone should keep me company.

GSA was different today..weird energy cuz it was the first meetin but it was actually kinda good lol. I feel different about going now..Im not THAT gay. I mean Im gay but not realli that flamboyant.I don't really look gay ( or at least I dun think I do? )and I am all for gay rights and like..being open but what am I even there for? I guess I just like going cuz theyr all my friends now. It was actually a decent sized group today. I had to leave right at 2:30 though. haha I keep thinkin how my sister doesn't know..or at least not from me. It shouldnt matter, I dont know why I havent told her. 

Anyways on an ungay note, I need to hang out with people that I never chill with. That's like everyone *shrugs*"

"event","Lol nuthin ever goes normally for me. I'm not even kidding either. Everything that I do has to somehow become ..un.. typical. So last night I was all..I can't stay still so I walked round a lot at the football game but I kept going back to Pingo Jimmy and Sammy cuz I love them. Alex was hangin out with me and I was a little sad for him but still happy I had someone to walk randomly with. Anyways my sister finally shows up and I'm happy to see her because well...why wouldn't I be? I introduce alex and stuff. Then my sister tells/warns me that my dad is going to be there at halftime..she was like...what the hell..why would he even come cuz Im takin the bus home? so I was all..what the hell *more angrily* times 1909784 because oncee again he was invading my safe place. Even though school isn't my favorite place to be, it's where I feel the safest and he ALWAYS invades my safe places. So Im super pissed. I got so angry that I looped round to sad again and started crying. I was going to leave (and Alex is cool so he was going to go with me) but then I thought..he should leave because I shouldn't have to run. Soo I stayed and sat by a cop with my bestest friends in the world for a while just so he would stay the hell away. Anyways when I finally went back over to the bleacher area I saw khalea and she told me that he left because Sharon told him to or sumthin (sharon= mom/stepmom..w/e u prefer). Sooo..thats a victory for me ppl! BTW...Im eating cream of wheat and its yummy."

"event","I've had a super boring/stressful day. It's going to take me a long time to write this because I'm doing my spanish hw right now. Ms.Chapman is challenging. I know I actually have to work to get an A from her. That's great because I do honestly really want to know Spanish, but bad because I have this super shyness that kicks in when I try to speak other languages. The teacher intimidates me and there are a lot of people in my class (for arhs at least) so I can't see myself being comfortable anytime soon. My participation grade will go down the tubes nd I'll get like a C. Bye Bye all Az.

Wow sometimes I don't really notice how many negative thoughts I have until I just write what I'm thinking. Anyways I am not writing this to depressed myself so..the perks of my dayy were/are:

- Will and Grace is on right now, and I lovee Jack. 
- I'm on the phone with Bethany and she just told me how she needs to cut off the tag of her underwear cause its annoying. And she is telling me how her pants are falling down. lol
- I had Antonio's pizza today and before that I haden't eaten any for a while.
- I took wickeddd wickedd funny pictures of Jimmy..and got one of Fiani making a possessed face at Jimmy too. I love Cameras. 
-Bethany is now telling me how her PJ pants are falling down to her ankles because they are too big. And Bethany just made me tell her everything I was writing because she is nosy. (Dictated By Bethany: And Bethany Loves Me) Random! MAD TV RULESS!
- wack and a bang and a wiggle waggle waggle ( Will and Grace)
- The other few perks of my day were frolicing round after school and taking a shower cuz I was all..gross nd sweaty."

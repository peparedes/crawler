"event","Can you recall where you where at when you heard of the attack? Do you remeber all of what you did that day and how you felt? It have been five years since that day and I just cant get over that cause to me it feels like it just happened last year. I remeber that day very well I was at work, At the time working on a bus taking care of deaf children. Any-who I was sitting back on the bus a little bored when one of the other drivers who listen to the radio on her trips came on to are radio and said two planes just crashed in the World Trade Centers. I was shocked I thought it was some sick joke till we all could gather around the TV in are lounge area. I could not believe what I was watching. I went home a napped when I woke up I was in shock like was that a bad dream or what? Was that real? I went back to work to finish me day out and the whole day was nothing but silence just about it was the wirdest thing cause in Phoenix so use to hearing planes over head but not that day or a few following it was quiet. I just remeber that night looking up at the sky and only seeing the smog and some stars and just kinda dumb founded. Well any-who that is what I remeber how about you?"

However they sent my brother home which I think they should of committed him. Other then that nothing more is going on moved in busy with work and that is about it."

"event","So I went into one of the hotels here filled out an app handed it in the next day got a phone call for an interview the hard part was out of the way. Went to my interview Yesterday and the lady was super hard to understand but I managed to somewhat understand her,any-who got a call while I was out celebrating a friends birthday and woot I got the job I am now a maid wait hmm now that I think about it I was always a maid just never got paid for it lol.The thing that I found out about a maids job that sucks is we only get a half hour to clean every room and for those who like to trash your hotels keep that in mind you make it fucking really hard on us.If that is the case though just go fuck yourself. Any way celebrated Mandalees 22nd birthday was pretty fun even though peeps kept trying to change things about the day.Woke up this morning to talk to my mom a bit about a van a saw yesterday while I was out and was seeing hey if I can get that van it could help me alot and if they could help me omg that would be sweet so hopefully everything is falling into place."

For example my dream last night was way bizaar. I dream-pt that I was with my Ex here in Washington, was talking with a friend in my room and looked down and said I will always be your seducer, looking at him he looked at me and smiled. Then well fill in the blanks.Either way weird for me cause I absolutely hate my Ex me and him want to kill one another. Oh well just weird in other news going out sometime this week to find a second job cause I am stuck in a dead end job that pays like nothing just enough to pay my storage.So I hope to find one soon.But Birthday approaches and I dont want it to even though a way cool friend of mine is throwing me an awsome bash I just dont want to get old. After I turned 21 that was enough is there anyway I can just go back in age come on dammit anywho gotta go see ya"

I love you all and this is no reflect on any of you.
This is what I wrote last night after I did what I did last night
<lj-cut text=""The Suicide Note"">I am sorry and dont you cry for me now. I am sorry I just couldn't take it anymore. My pain is no more. I was hurting and you just couldn't see it. Why did the gods form a horrible waist of life like me. I loved all of who I came in contact with, Whether it was the internet or in person I knew you in some way.
So many of you touched my torcherd and tormented soul. It is time for me to make peace and finally say good bye I just want you all to remember I love you.
Live your lives to the fullest potential Never give up on your dreams.I am not sure Where I am going from here but it has to be better then where I am now. If I dont Die tonight from my wounds then maybe it just wasn't meant to be I guess. As of that I will just have to work on a better tomorrow and to stop yet again and really work on getting myself out of the situation I am in.                                         Love always,

Now I wrote this think I was not going to make it last night but I guess I did I must not of hit the vain right but I am happy I didn't what I am doing is foolish and I know I need Help I have seek-ed help before but Not sure where to go here for it but I will get help. I do not want any of you to worry about me I am fine. I am writing this to let you know what is truly going on with me. Your my friends and I respect all of you and I know if one of you were in pain I would want to know. Dont freak out by this just grow to understand it."

"event","I am in a pickle of a problem with a couple of my friends they use to be good friends but something happened one night and I am not sure what it was but I feel responsible so I wont rest till they are back to at least speaking terms. Friendship 1 The state of being friends 2 attachment between friends 3 friendly feeling or attitude. Friends of or having to do with friends or quakers.To me friendship isn't that easy sometime yeah sure you want to kick eachothers asses but you know what that is the joy of having your friends. To me a friend is someone you go to when you need a shoulder, someone who will help you keep your head up when things are down for you, someone that you are there for as well, someone you fight with because face it we all dont get along sometimes but we shouldn't throw away a friendship over a ridiculous fight we should talk things over it is time to throw petty thing away cause you never know what will happen next life is way too short.Not saying anything would heaven forbid but you never know. Friends are family you dont just toss them aside and forget about them take some time apart if it is needed but dont throw it away Please. I love all my friends and I hate to see them fighting and giving up on one another. If there is anything I could do for you two I would and will do but do something for me and at least talk to one another and figure things out."

"event","Ok well this morning I was woken up by my neighbors dogs and well I didn't think anything of it a few hours later I went out looking for my Cat Drake-O and I decided to go see what the hell the dogs were barking at in the mean time well I found Drake-O he was stuck in my neighbors Shed in a little vent that went into his shed I freaked out cause these dogs were trying anything to get him so I ran to the neighbors door tried to get someone but they were all gone so I had my mom distract the dogs at one end of there yard and I entered the yard and did a rescue. Poor guy was so mangled and beat up I got him inside and man he was soo filthy as well he smelled like puke and rusted metal. So as much as it was going to suck I drew him up a little bath water and I picked him up and brought him into the bath surprisingly he liked it. He stayed and let me clean him however once he got soap on his nose he wanted out and well by that time I was done brought him out of the bath brushed him, and dried him up. He's doing better now but he is shoo-ken up and he hardly can walk I checked his back paws cause I noticed him limping and no broken bones, thank the gods I just think he maybe a little bruised. Now he is just resting up in my bed he hasn't eaten anything but I am sure he will. I think he just needs some time to rest I am just happy I found him when I did cause I found out that one of the dogs that attacked him like to eat cats. However I don't think Drake-O will ever go over there again I just hope his brothers learned from Drake-O's mistake and don't go over there either."

Hopefully in a few days I get to work in the music section or even the movies.I have to ask this how come there are so many damn books on George Bush and there are Even books he has done for the CHristian Faith man it took alot from me not to put them all in a box and take them outside and burn them up All I have to say is Burn Baby Burn. I really Hate Bush he should be shot stupid mother fucker AAA ok I am stopping now. Other then that had a pretty good day hate the fact I am waking up early now but I am happy that I am working.

"event","Ok well first things first still havn't heard anything from Hasting should hear something tomorrow gods I hope I get this job. In other news last night for almost 3 hours talked on the phone with my ex about life and old friends that I want to keep as old friends as the sounds of it, Why I talked to him who knows Maybe it cause no matter what he will always own a piece of my heart after all he was my first of everthing and well maybe another reason would be because I want to keep him as a friend he was a really good friend before we got together and I just kinda want that back. Well anyways This morning OMG I was doing some reading and injoying a nice cup of Green Tea with Jasmin and Lemon when both brothers come up stairs fighting my mom and step dad where gone so I had to try and split them up Geez this was no easy task. Well Eric had his fork in his hands from his breakfast and he decided to throw it into my other brother Stephens arm At this point I am so happy it wasn't a knife cause who knows how bad it would of been wellit was already bad but it could of been worse. Well Stephen looks down at it yanks it out of his arm and starts beating up on his brother they were both just going at it I couldn't seperate them nothing I told them to just take it outside I didn't want them to break anything I was sick of there shit and come on Brothers they all fight I guess it is just the guy thing. Well they quit Stephens arm was gushing with blood I looked at it he is luky it didn't hit a vaine or something but it went into his arm a good 3 inches but my brother is a tuff guy hes all its fine and just kinda shrugged it off well geez these boys man they make it were I dont want kids but hey I couldn't ask for a better birth control."

"event","Wow I can't believe I haven't updated this in about a month. Lets see not much is new. Well there is a couple things but not something I want to share with the whole world (or whoever reads this). 
School starts in about two weeks. I can't wait, I need a change. I have been working way too much. On the other hand its been nice getting a lot of money in my check. 
My birthday is in 12 days. YEAH!!!!! I can't believe I am going to be 22. That seems like it is so old. But I guess thats cool. I talked with my boss a couple of weeks ago. I am going to buy the day care from her in about 5 years. YEah I am going to own my own business. I just need to get my teaching degree. Which I am going for. 
Lets see what else is new. Yeah my uncle came home at the end of july. He was overseas. He is in the navy. I am so glad he is home. We are having a huge welcome home party for him on my birthday. I can't wait. It is going to be a good time. We are celebrating all of the holidays and parties he missed while he was away. Well I gotta go pick the girls up from the movies. Later..."

Lets see whats new?? Well Katie and I got engaged. YEAH!!! I am so excited. Her moms side of the family knows about it and they want to know when it is and all but we have no idea. It won't be for a while. 
I am on vacation right now for all next week. Thank god cause I really need a break. So we have a lot of plans for next week. I just can't wait to spend the whole week with Katie. We haven't really spent much time together lately. 
I went to the casino yesterday with my stepdad. I really don't like foxwoods. It sucks. I lost a lot of money. But it wasn't my money so I guess its cool. I went kayaking last weekend with my stepdad. I loved that. It was so awesome. I will probably go again tomorrow. I want to get a kayak of my own but they cost way too much money. 
Well nothing much really new going on... plus I don't feel like talking anymore. So later. 

Oh yeah.. one of my friends is going through a rough time right now. I just want to say hang in there girl. Things will get better..."

"event","Okay so right now it is almost 3 o'clock in the morning and I have to work at 12 today. I can't fall asleep. It is hotter than hell in our bedroom. Katie doesn't seem to mind cuz she is out cold right now. Plus it doesn't help that we took a four hour nap today. So I don't think I will be sleeping at all tonight. Which sucks. 

I didn't have to work today. Instead I went to jury duty. Oh that was so much fun...not. Well I didnt have to serve for a trial because I knew some of the witnesses. So I was only there until 11. Not bad. Only three hours I wasted today. 

Not much else is new. Still working at daycare. Everyday. Yeah I don't mind it so much. I was in the baby room all week, they dont do much so it wasn't really stressful. It just makes me really tired cause its boring. 

We are having a little get together this weekend to celebrate fourth of july. Not too many people coming. Just our close friends. Can't wait for the fireworks. They were pretty good last year. 
Yeah so thats it for now... I don't feel like writing anymore."

"event","Yeah so whats up??? I am finally a college graduate. I now have my associates degree. I am going back to QVCC in the fall. I want to get a certificate. The graduation was really boring. But whatever. However, the party on sunday was great. Mostly because I got a lot of money and because I got drunk. What could be better. 

My graduation gift from Beck and the rest of the Websters was a turtle. A real live turtle. I just got him this past thursday. He is so cute. A little red eared slider. I named him Alex Piper. But most of the time I just call him pipsqueak. And let me tell you turtles are pretty damn expensive. I spent $117 on him already. And I've only have him for four days. But I love him so its all good. 

I went to see my mom today and she told me about one of the kids I went to school with was found dead. This kid, Abram Ouillette, graduated two years before me. His parents live right down the road from me. They don't know how he died. They just found his body in the backseat of a car in Southbridge. How messed up is that?

Lets see what else is new... nothing really. Crystal and Michelle are back together!!! YAY!!!! :) I am happy for them. 
Laura came over the house the other day to go swimming and race her boats. She's a cool girl to hang out with. Congrats on the new job Laura. 

Katie and I have been together for 16 months now. :) I am so happy with her. 

Yeah and thats it for now..."

"event","A lot has been going on this week. I worked all week as usual. I ended up working like 31 hours this week. Only because Donna called out for three days. So thats okay with me because that will be a nice check. I am only working on tuesday and wednesday this week. That sucks because it is only like 7 hours but I asked for thursday and friday off so I can deal with it. 

Friday night Katie and I just chilled at the house. We were both extrememly tired. Then on saturday we went to let out P's dog and drove up to see her parents at the campground. We stayed there until Katie went to work. Then I drove around everywhere to get things we needed for that night. I ended up visiting with my mom for like 2 hours. 

Saturday night we went to the campground to stay the night. We were supposed to go to the movies with Sara and Katelyn but they never called. So instead I picked up alcohol for everyone. It was a great night. Crystal you should have been there. Don't know why you didn't call. Katie's dad (popi) was wasted. He is so funny when he is drunk. Kate got a little drunk. The only ones who weren't drunk were me, Beck, and Ry ry. We really enjoyed everyone else acting like idiots. 

Sunday we hung out at the campsite until Katie went to work. Then I went to my moms for a little bit before my uncles party. That was a blast (NOT). Russell was asking me all sorts of questions about Katie and I. I was getting pissed. Then my aunt Deb (Spinelli) was yelling at me for smoking. So it wasn't the best day. After the party Kate and I went home. 

Today Katie went riding with popi, Beck, Nick, Shaun, and Tracy. So I am here just relaxing. It is my job to make sure the girls don't get into any trouble. 
I can't wait until Thursday. I am graduating!!!! Then my party next weekend. 

Alright thats it for now... Later...."

I didnt work at all last week. It was so nice. I needed a break from that place. The people there were driving me crazy. But I have to go back tomorrow. Only for a couple hours though so thats good. I can't wait to see little Aedan on the 2nd. I haven't seen that kid in the longest time. 
I went to my moms today. And as soon as I got there my mom goes ""I have some good news for you. Your aunt Amy is pregnant."" Which I already knew. Then my mom tells me that my aunt is having twins!!!!!!!!! I am so excited. They are due on Dec. 22nd. I can't wait. Hopefully she doesn't miscarry this time. I want more cousins. She better have at least one girl. There are too many boys in my family. I only have one girl cousin and the rest are boys. So yeah it is time for a change. 
We hung out with Crystal for a little bit this week. That was cool. I missed her.
Yeah thats all the good news I have for right now so bye...
CRYSTAL- I am glad you and Michelle are back together."

Haven't heard from Crystal in a while. I hope everything is alright.
Yesterday Katie, Laura, and I went to old navy and got a shit loud of things. Kate and I spent $144.

I'm so proud of him. Then Saturday Katie and I went to the mall to get a mothers day gift. I got my mom this really nice necklace and had it engraved. Then we went to see my dad for a couple hours. Then my brother after that. I didn't do anything sunday as usual. But yeah I'm in class now. So bye..."

"event","This weekend was good... Friday Katie and I went to Macaroni grill to have lunch and to see my brother (he is a waiter there). And we got to see Kimmie. I missed that girl. She lost weight, I guess that happens when you can't really eat because of mono. Then I had to go to work but I got out early. Then I came home and slept for a couple hours. After that Katie and I went over her sisters and drank a little. She was fine but I was wasted. We ended up going home at like midnight (Ron came and picked us up). Ron and Becky were laughing at me because I was trying to walk a straight line and I just couldn't do it. It was really funny. Ron really enjoyed seeing me drunk. Now we are even. 
 Saturday was alright. I went to see Sean. He is home from the air force until Friday. So we hung out for a while, he showed me the movie he made. It is kind of like Jackass. It was funny. He was bored one day and decided to swallow a small fish that he feeds to his piranhas. So he swallowed it then puked it back up and put it back in the tank. It was nasty but funny. 
 Then I went to see my mom. We were there for about an hour. Then after that it was home. I didn't really do anything today. It was a lazy day. Back to school tomorrow for another boring day. But thankfully there is only three weeks left so thats cool. And I need to pass two of my classes to graduate. But I am not worried about that. So yeah that's it for now.

Work on monday wasn't that bad. I was in the toddler room by myself with four toddlers. But they were all good. We had a total of 15 kids in the daycare. I love school vacations. There are barely any kids at daycare. Yesterday was pretty much the same. And today there should only be 5 toddlers. 
I actually went to my government class yesterday. I made a deal with Katie. I promised her I would go to all of my classes for the rest of the semester if I didn't go to psych on monday. SO yeah fun fun fun. 
Alright class is about to start so thats it for now..."

Yesterday I went to Brandon and Chandler's baseball games. Chandler played 1 1/2 innings then decided he didn't want to play tee ball anymore. He said it wasn't fun. He's really good though. So that kind of sucked. Then there was Brandon's game. He didn't play much. But it was still good to watch the game. His team won 10-4. 
Then I went to see my mom. I haven't seen her in about a week. She is doing good. Katie and I visited with her for a little over an hour and a half. 
Yeah so I have to work every day next week as usual. That sucks. But hey I need the money. Well thats it for now. Bye bye"

After that I had to go to work. That wasn't that bad. Cael is still sick. Poor little guy. But the kids were pretty good today, unlike monday. 
I can't wait until saturday. Brandon has his first baseball game of the season. His team won the championship game last year so they are playing the first this year. And Chandler plays his first tee ball game on saturday. I can't believe he is old enough to play already. They grow up so fast.
Katie and I are looking for a puppy. So if anyone out there knows of any for sale or for free let me know. Thanks.

After the game we sat there for a while talking to Katelyn and Sara. It was a bit awkward at first but then things got better. Those two are funny. We should be hanging out with them soon. 
After the game we had the family party at my dads. That wasn't too bad. Only got mad was but it's all good now. I got to see my family which was cool. The food wasn't that bad either. We didn't stay that long. just a couple of hours. I finally got to see my brother. I haven't seen him in weeks. 
Last night we watched Dawn of the Dead. That was a cool ass movie. It reminded me of 28 days later. But thats a good movie too.

Crystal decided that she doesn't want to be friends with Katie and I anymore. According to her we are jealous of her ""happiness."" Which is bullshit but whatever. She said a lot of other nasty crap too. So I guess that's over. Her loss. Lets see what else is new, oh yeah Katie and I are going out to lunch with Sara and Katelyn soon. That should be pretty interesting. Katie and Sara don't get along very well, but we are going to try and see how things go. 
Monday night was the Maroon 5 concert. That was so fricken awesome. We got the tickets from my aunt Kris. Anyways, the drive down wasn't bad. We got there an hour and a half before the doors opened. So we just chilled out in the car. The Donnas opened up for them. That would have been cool if we could hear what they were singing. Maroon 5 was great. The lead singer, Adam, is so hot.
I didn't go to psychology or work yesterday. I didn't feel very good. I ended going home and sleeping until 7:20. That was all I needed. It felt great, and it got rid of my fever. I have class at 1230 and I really don't want to go to it. It is too damn boring. But I'm going to. 
I have to go to my dads this weekend which sucks. We are having a ""family"" party. Which is humorous because we aren't even like a family anymore. I haven't seen my aunt in over a year. And she doesn't really make any attempt to see me. I do see my grampa alot though. I really hope Jay and Jillian are going this weekend. That way I won't feel so weird.

"event","This week-end was pretty fun.  We didn't have a whole lot of money but we still managed to get out there and do something.

On friday we stayed in.  Danny is always exhausted during the week because the Army has him up at 4 AM everymorning.  So we stayed in and watched his movie of Soldier.

On Saturday we woke-up early (well around 10 am haha) and went to the gym.  We got back and we were all starved so I made a really good montery chicken with vegetables which Anais even liked.  She's so picky ya know?  Then we actually sat back and watched Lifetime movies...how funny huh?

Sunday was the fun day.  We were actually bored of being boring people so we went out to the mall and walked around.  We went into Mervyns just because and found they were having a big $1 sale on many toys and stuff.  We opted for books instead of toys.  They had a bunch of A Little Golden Book Books so we got Anna one of each kind that they had.  It ended up being 8 books for 8 bucks.  Pretty good deal and she was happy.  I read two of them to her in the car and she has them memorized already.  It's amazing me to how great her memory is.  Where does she store all of that?  She can read the story back to me as if she's reading it!  Damn!

After that we went to Best Buy.  Danny wanted to use his new best buy card he just got in the mail.  As you all must know this is Danny's first ever credit card.  It's not that he had bad credit, just no credit so when Best-buy gave him one he was all excited about bringing up his credit rating.  Up until now anything and everything had to be in my name.  So he feels much better about himself.  Weird how guys gage their worth by how much power they have.  And power in anything....brute strength, money, whatever.  They are competive in anything.  Especially Danny...he is the epitome of competition.  

ANYWAY...I'm rambling.  So I bought the movie Monster which was okay, but depressing as depressing can be.  I actually wanted it just because I wanted to see how Charlize Theron (one of my favorite actresses) looked in the movie.  I heard they made her look so ugly so I wanted to see it.  I had no idea what it was about.  In the middle of the movie I got bored and disgusted with it so ran off to my computer for a little break from the nastiness of it.  We bought Anna a computer game that actually helps you learn to read.  It wasn't very expensive at all, $12.99 and it's called Jump Start Phonics.  She loves it.  Hopefully she'll be the top of her class....er...no I mean she WILL be the top of her class since most kids here don't even speak english.  I'm not talking trash either!  Damn!  I was one of those kids. ;) 

THEN..before we came home we stopped by Albertsons cause Danny wanted something sweet.  He bought Nestle Toll House Candy Bars cookies and I bought reduced fat chips ahoys.  They weren't bad at all, just a little dry.  After I dunked them in my fat-free milk though they tasted even better.  

And by the way, all this non-fat, reduced fat crap isn't working.  I still weigh the same.  Darn!"

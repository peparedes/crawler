"event","Wow its been a really long time since i have written in here. I don't know where all my time goes but I never seem to have time to just sit down and write. I was just reading my last journal entries and so much has changed since then. So many experiences that have changes me as a person. You don't even realize how everyday something unimagineable could happen and it can change the course of your life forever. A couple months ago I started hanging out with a girl I worked with and now have become really close to her and her fiance. They are a huge part of my life and I don't know what I would do without them. I worked with her for 5 months before we started hanging out and one night out of the blue we just decided to go out. And it has changed so much in my lfe, and so many things have happened since that day.
    In one of my classes we are studying the growth from innocence into adulthood and all the experiences you go through to get there. I have done so much growing since I have met these guys. Some of it has been forced upon me in which I had to learn to accept things but it has all been for the good. I don't think any part of me has grown in a way that will hinder me. In class we talk about how we as humans try to limit the spontaniety of our everyday lives because we want to be comfortable but its those days when we least expect it that will make us grow the most. I've been really upset over a guy lately and in class I started thinking about how any day something could happen that will change my life forever. Why should I limit myself to something especially when it wasn't good for me. It made me realize how I should live everyday and not be miserable because things aren't working out exactly how I planned. Because maybe something bigger is going to happen tomorrow and if I would have limited myslef then I would have missed it. So now I am a little more excited about everyday becuase you never know whats going to happen. Maybe its a stupid way of thinking but it has helped me through these past couple of weeks that have been real hard. 
    So maybe the next time I write in here I will have something completely different to write about other then this guy that has had me upset because something greater has happened.....we shall wait and see"

"event","So I havent wrote in here for a long time but I thought it was about time to update. My subject heading is a name of a song by the group Incubus. They happen to be my most favorite and to make a long long story short, I got to meet them and hang out with them and get tickets to their concert and the best part was that they were everything I wanted them to be. Perfection at its best. So I have of course been listening to thier music non-stop for two weeks now and that is one of their new songs on the album ""Morning View"", and I love it.....I keep thinking that it relates to me in so many ways and I cant stop listening to his voice. I just feel lately like everyone else is figuring themselves out and finding a place for themselves and I have no clue where my place is. I hate how I always feel like I only have a place in this world if I am with a guy. I guess thats the only way I feel secure or something. Pathetic huh? But I cant seem to help it. I have come a long way since I broke up with my ex but I just now realized that I didnt come as far as I thought. I figured that out when I spent two days with this awesome guy and I thought things were going well with us but I havent heard from him. I got upset. And now I am pissed cause I realized I am not as strong as I thought I would be.
I was actually thinking in the car tonight on the way home from work, that something must have been wrong with me if he hasnt called....he told one of our mutual friends that he liked me and so I thought everything was going well but i guess not. But tonight I felt like my old self again, not the one that I have been the past few months. I thought I had learned so much and become so much stronger...guess not! 
And to make things worse, I saw an old obsession that I had and now he is calling me and I dont know how to say no to the guy. Its just not in my vocabulary when it comes to him and I cant figure out why. Its not like he is something I can see myself with but i just cant do it. He wants to hang out this week, and I keep telling myself to be prepared for the phone call but I know when it comes I will answer....am I the only one like this????
School is almost here I feel like....6 weeks and I am down to Virginia again, I am scared out of my mind. I keep thinking that it must be God that is keeping me away from this boy Phil cause he knows that if I was to start seeing someone that I would more then likely make stupid decisions. I guess God knows that he is doing afterall.
I am in one of those moods, I feel like I want to cry. I always think that I am so happy now that I worked through so much of my pain the past few months but it is times like these that I feel ten times worse and I feel like I didnt work through anything. I guess I just feel alone. This songs lyrics keep sticking in my head. I listen to it over and over again and I want to cry...maybe I will just go to bed....here they are
""What ravages of spirit
conjured this temptuous rage
created you a monster
broken by the rules of love
and fate has lead you through it
you do what you have to do
and fate has led you through it
you do what you have to do ...""

.....God I hope fate leads me through this"

"event","So today the weather was amazing. Well I guess not for those who are use to nice days out but for Rochester, we dont take it for granted. But of course I had to work all day and missed most of it. I got out around 6 and it was still light out for about an hour....I drove the 35 minutes that it takes to get home with my music as loud as it could go and my window rolled. That kind of weather is suppose to make me happy but for some reason it made me sad. I felt really alone at that point. I guess it was because it was so nice out and you feel like everyone must be outside doing something or going out tonight and I realized I had no one to do that with. Ever since I have felt let down by my bro I have had this overwhelming feeling of being alone. It made me think of the summer when I was with Jesse and how I dont have that anymore. I listened to Linkin Parks new song ""My December"" and tears started coming down my face. It talks about how it was his december and how it was his point in his life where everything was coming together but that he would give it all up just to spend time with someone and have someone there. Maybe thats not what it was really about but thats what I gathered. It made me feel like he was just singing my emotions. How I am trying so hard and this is the time in my life where I can really do anything that I wanted right now but somehow I know that if I could just have someone there who I cared so much about and they felt the same way that I would give all this up. 

I want to go out tonight...since I dont have to work until tomorrow night and I have this feeling like I just want to be out and around people. But I am also so exhausted from working all day. I drank last night too so this morning I was sick of course going into work. But I think the weather helped me feel better. 

I was just staring at the wall in front of me, at all the X's that i have on my calender. Everyday that passes, I put an X through. It started as a counting down to the day I get to leave for Virginia but after everythign that happened this week with my brother I dont even know if I am looking forward to that now. I feel aimless right now. Like usually I have one thing to look forward too and that keeps my main focus until it passes by but right now I am just wandering in and out of days and they seem to be passing but fast or slow I havent decided????"

"event","So today is going to be a long day...I have school all day and then have to head straight to work...yuck! But then again I guess I need to stay busy, thats a good thing. The past couple of days my brother has been home with his girlfriend and I am sooo ready for them to leave today. Not really his girlfriend, I always get along with her but my brother has really dissapointed me lately. For the past 5 years I have been there for him through a really difficult time in his life. I was always there at 2 or 3 in the morning when he needed someone to talk to and sacrificed alot through my first semester of college cause I knew he needed someone to be there. But now that his life has become a fairy tale he isnt here for me when I have needed him the most. I have always looked up to him and thought that what he said was the most important thing. Now I am just left with dissapointment. He has really let me down and left me really hurt. We got into a fight yesterday and I just felt so betrayed. I guess it hurt so much because he was ultimatly the last person I thought to expect that from. It almost made me scared to because i thought if he could do that to me then what would happen with everyone else. Where will they be when I need them the most? I guess I am realizing more and more how alone I am right now. But the difference between now and a month ago is I think I am better prepared to handle it. Usually I would have gotten all upset and it would have ruined the rest of my day but instead i just did my own thing and actually got more accomplished because I didnt hang out with them. I Dont Know. I think that is my answer to everything lately. Cause I have come to the conclusion that I dont know much of anything anymore. I am surprised everyday by people and there lack of character. So who knows right? 
So I am going to get through the day and I cant wait for it to be over. I hate my new job and I just wish I didnt have that stress on me right now. It would feel so good to just go home after school today and lounge around and do nothing. But then again I guess thats when I get myself into trouble and start hanging out with people I shouldnt. 
I have hung out with one of my ex-bf's the past couple of days. Its really wierd cause I never know what he is thinking. He was my first Love. I was devastated when he broke up with me, but that was a couple years ago and I dont know if I have changed or if he has or if I just see him differently now but I could never see myself with him again. I actually found myself hating that too. Cause he would be such a good guy for me right now. But I just cant seem to find those feelings. I have also hung out with this new guy too. BUT HE'S SHORT! How sad is that. But one thing I have caught myself doing is sizing both of them up for a relationship which is the #1 thing I am not allowed to do right now. Doc told me I cant have a relationship for atleast 6 months and I know I cant. I need to be better before I can do that to him or me. I just am not sure when I will know that I am better. Its just not going to hit me in the face. But this week has shown me that I defintly still have a lot to work on cause if I didnt then I would have been able to go out with both of these guys and not thought twice about what a relationship would be like with them. It shouldnt be about that. It should be about having fun and then if something works out in the end then thats great and if not then we are still friends.
I guess I should stop babbling now. I have another hour to waste before my next class but oh well I guess.....yuck I hate today"

"event","So I use to be really good friends with this guy...his name is Tom. We were together pretty much everyday until I moved away for a bit. When I was gone he got this girlfriend, whom I hated even before that. Her name is amy. We never got along, she is one of the most insecure people I know. So anyways...she cant handle that me and tom are friends again and she tries to make us fight all the time. I never can tell if its her on the computer under his name or really him. Cause most of the time he wouldnt ever say the things to me that he does now. I mean seriously what is wrong with people? Do they just not know how to fuckin be normal. If me and tom wanted to be together it would have happened a long time ago. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR FUCKIN HEAD AMY! I just want to scream at her. I hate letting tom go as a friend but I think thats what it is down to. I feel like I am doing that alot lately. Is that what goes on now that we are moving on in our lives? Is it just full of giving up people you thought you cared about and who you thought cared about you? I guess I just dont understand how people are so emotionless. I mean I could never under normal circumstances give up toms freindship, why is it so easy for him. I shared one of the hardest parts of my life with him and that was leaving home. I will never forget how he has helped me and the time that we have shared together. How come he can? 
I think I am done analyzing. Yeah right, thats like my daily medicine. I cant go without it. everything that happens to me I analyze. I just think I need to give up on trying to figure people out. I think i just need to surround myslef with a few good people. People I know without a doubt care and wont leave me hangin in the dust when the bullshit has settled. I mean I always thought the key to that was having so many friends. Now I have realized its the oppisite. I just need one or two. Thats enough for me. And I think i have them. I could never live without them. They teach me things everyday and I get more then just a companion out of our friendship....I get truth. Thats all I need right now. ""surround yourself with good people and you wont get treated bad"" my friend once told me. Shes right! So I guess its sad that I have to move on and leave people I care about behind but as long as I have those few I will be okay. Right? RIGHT!"

Its like I said how I am friends with these horrible people and even tho I know I shouldnt be I still hang out with them. Everyday I try to break the cycle, I really dont even care about them and if my other friends were home I wouldnt even hang out with them but when I am alone and have nothing to do I cant seem to say no to them. After I went through all this shit with them this weekend I turn around and hang out with one of them today. WHY? Why the fuck do I do that? And then when two people asked me what I did today I didnt even want to admit cause I felt so stupid. And right now I just got it into my head that all this bullshit is done. That I am going to start being busy now with school and work and that I wont do it anymore....I pray to god I wont. I am trying so hard to do the right thing. I feel so bad for the people that have to put up with me. I can tell my brother gets so mad at me cause of what I do...I guess I just hope they are patient with me cause I really am trying and it is hard. Its like I think things like hanging out today are harmless but its these things that lead into all the other bullshit. I dont know...I guess I cant apologize anymore to people...just hopefully those that are close enough will look past it and those that arent will be weeded out soon enough."

I get so  far ahead and something causes me to take those few steps backward. I hate it. I am sick of pushing and pushing and it just seems like everyday more wieght is added to that thing that I am pushing and I dont even know what it is or why I am fighting for it. Its almost like I get so close to finding out what it is...like its some happy life or something and then there is a setback. It never fails, its like clockwork. 
I knew I had to cry last night. I knew it was going to come out over one thing or another. I mean I make the bad decisions and for some reason expect them not to back fire on me. Am I the only person who does this? The only thing that helped me was to have a friend tell me exactly how it is...no sugar coating. I seem to surround myself with horrible people and when they treat me like shit I get all upset and wonder why. Its like I take it personally, like I did something wrong when they dont give a shit about our friendship. But I realized last night that it isnt me. Its them. They just arent good people. The other night my friend told me that he hasnt met a girl at school and he has been there over a year....I asked him why cause there is over 20,000 people there and he just simply said...""good people are hard to find""  HOW TRUE IT IS!"

I wish for once I could be warned as in what mood I am going to be in 15 minutes from now....I'm all over the place. I dont know why anyone would want to take drugs to get that way. God, they are taking drugs to get that way and I am fuckin trying to find a drug to just be normal...does anyone else think that is fucked up?

I dont know what it is about these nightmares that I am having lately...I am really getting sick of them. I wake up so upset because of them in the morning and its like they set my mood for the day....oh well right?

So today was a pretty good day I guess...it was sunny and got a little warm witch put me in a pretty good mood. Went to see the movie ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and it was really good....just one of the those lazy days I guess, which I needed. It doesnt seem like I do much during the day but the past month or two have been so emotionally draining that I could just be sitting here on the couch and feel wiped out. Tomorrow is another Dr.'s appt. We'll see how that goes!"

I volunteered to be the first person (where that came fun, i have no idea) but I got it done and out of the way and when I was done two different people came up to me and said how good I did....it made me feel good...it made me feel like I overcame something...some fear that I have always had....

"event","I feel sorry for the people that are friends with me....for my ex-boyfriend...my family..I just realized today that I have nothing to offer them...nothing substantial anyway. Another meeting with the psych doctor made me realize that I have nothing to offer people cause I have nothing to offer myself...I mean how could I possibily make someone happy when I cant even make myself happy. I feel pathetic. I mean she said that yeah there are factors as to why that is but why wasn't I stronegr then that. Why did these things come into my life and I wasn't strong enough to push them away like everyone else. Everyone has problems. They knew how to deal with them. Why didn't I? I had to laugh today when she told me that I ""couldn't"" be in a relationship with a guy for atleast 6 months. I mean I know she didnt mean it like that. It wasnt like an order or anything. If she only knew me and how fast I jump into them without even thinking what I am doing. I guess thats why she said tho, maybe she knows me better then I know myself. Isnt that funny how that works? 
Shes right tho. I cant be in a relationship. She says I have to make myself strong. I have to be able to be happy and not let someone dictate that. She doesnt know how right she is. Everyone in my life dictates how I feel. I am pretty sick of it. I wish I knew how to do the things I want to do. but then again I dont know what they are. Its funny cause people have been asking me lately what I like to do and what I do in my free time, stuff like that...I cant come up with one damn thing. How sad is that?
My mom came with me today. Worked out exactly how I expected. She is so blind to things. I just wish I saw myself like I saw her. I dont see how pathetic I look when I let others dictate how I feel but I see my mom like that every day. I see how my dad treats her and I hate it. It makes me so angry and I wonder how someone lets that happen. And then I realized today I do that exact thing. When a guy treats me like shit, I just brush it off and think they made a mistake, think they must really like me or something and they just made an honest mistake. BULLSHIT! I guess I know how my friends feel when I do that same thing. They must get so angry with me when they see someone treat me that way and I just go right back into it. I know how frusterating it is. I always promised myself I wouldnt be my mom. I am excatly like her. PATHETIC!
SO I got this job at this bar. Little scared about that, but at the same time I think it will open me up. Make me strong. I have to be to handle a bunch of drunken bastards and still keep my composure I guess. 
I am dreading Valentines Day. USually it doesnt bother me all that much but this one is going to be a killer. I miss my ex so much. Everyday I push the thoughts of him away. Its like a movie. How I know I love him but I know I am not what he needs right now and vice versa. I know I need to concentrate on myself right now however selfish that may sound. The Doc said today that I should try putting as much energy into myself as I do my relationships....Mingia that would be insane. I dont know how to go about that. I think relationships have been my safety net. So I didnt have to think about myself and I could concentrate on them. I avoid myslef at all costs. I realized talking to the Doc how painfull it is to do that.
I am sick of talking about all that....lets think of something cheerful. HMMM....oh I got my car back today, I got into an accident and it got fixed and I owed nothing...pretty unusual for me...usually I owe the world. There I go again being negative.
well I think I will end on that...Sick of thinking for the night..summing up my days makes me realize how unimportant they are. BLAH BLAH BLAH right? Yeah thats what I thought."

"event","So how come on certain days I feel like things are getting better and I feel like I am starting to accomplish things for myself and then others like today just feel like nothing has changed....I cant take this same old shit anymore...I feel like the answer to all this is to just get the hell out of here but when I leave for Virginia in a couple months I dont think anything is going to change...I mean I cant even get along with the people I am going to live with and I havent even begun living with them...I just think I have gotten to this point in my life where I cant stand anyone anymore....I mean is it possible for me to meet people that I dont think are fucking retards anymore? I mean am I just not moral or is everyone just complete morons????
I dont know about this life anymore...I am pretty uncertain about everything lately...I keep having these dreams and I wake up and for the rest of the day I am so upset...I dont know how to distingiush them from the everyday shit....they make me feel like whatever happened in them really happened and I start to feel like I cant trust anyone anymore...
I miss my ex-boyfriend so much....I think about him all the time...I know I cant be with him, we were just two different people...I realized though why now...before I just never understood why we didnt get along and why I felt the way I felt...now I do...its like I guess I just needed someone right now who would take responsiblity for things...someone who was part of my everyday bullshit...someone who would almost take control of things and make decisions..good decisions....he never did that...I had so much to think about and our relationship just gave me more to think about...more worries, cause I not only had myslef to think about but him too...I needed it the other way around, somone who would take care if me...I need that right now...is that wrong? I realized how nice he was to me and how good of a boyfriend he will be to someone else...someone who doesnt need someone as much as I needed him...I miss that...I miss him, I wish I would have met him at a different point in our lives...when he was grown up and took responsibilty for himself and when I wasnt so fucked up....
So I am going on anti-depressant pills in the next couple of days...whenever the fucking doctors office can get their shit together...I need them now...I needed them yesterday...I needed them Two fucking years ago...why didnt I see that...why didnt anyone see that...God that makes me realize how alone I am...my brother tells me that I expect too much out of life, that I expect that some silver platter is going to be handed to me, and that somehow someone is going to give me a break...he says that I should work harder, and fight everything that comes my way....I guess I just want to know what you do when you are too tired to keep fighting....if anyone knows the answer to that ya wanna send it my way?"

"event","I just finished that book...""She's Come Undone""...everyone should read it. It made me rethink everything I do...I wish I could follow my life by one line in that book, ""Accept what people offer. Drink their milkshakes. Take their Love."" This past week had been one of the hardest weeks ever. Still broken up with my bf, which is good. For once, I actually followed someones advice in which my good friend told me to wait a week and not go back and then see if I still feel the same way...You were right Linds, I dont. I miss someone being there, but I guess it didnt have to be him. I learned something very sad this weekend though. Well I thought it was sad anyway cause I live by people so much but what I learned is that no one is going to make me happy!! But myself. I guess I found that sad cause I always thought I would find some sweet guy or something that would sweep me off my feet, not hurt me, not lie to me and we would be happy. But I realized this weekend through many peoples advice that even if you do find that...nothing is ever ""happy"" all the time...that the more you care about someone the more its going to hurt b/c you can never determine what they are going to do...you cant live by other people. I guess I always thought that if I trusted someone enough, if I loved them enough then they wouldnt hurt me. YEAH RIGHT! Where was I the past 10 years of my life? Being niave? I guess so. It just sucks dont ya think? So I started thinking this weekend about what makes ME happy. What can I do that no one can take away from me if they leave me. That when I have another one of these weeks when I am feeling so alone that just by doing this one thing it will fullfill me. And the answer I came up with is NOTHING. And thats why I am so sad at what I learned this weekend. I could come up with a billion things to fill up my time but I cant think of anything that makes me as happy as being with someone that you think you are in love with and knowing that they feel the same way. Even if it is just for that moment or that week, month,m year, whatever it is. I guess we just have to take what we can get and when thats over move on. No matter how hard that may be. I think I came ""undone"" this weekend too, but hopefully today was the start of putting myself back together. Learning from what I am going through and moving on. I hope. I miss my friends though. I know that they are one thing i will never give up again. I awas always that girl who gave up all her time and energy to her relationship...but not anymore, but guess whos there when it all ends...I dont know what I would do if they werent right now. Its the only thing that is holding me together. I'm goin to bed...enough thinkin for one night!"

I feel like everyones opinions are getting to me and not allowing me to feel my own feelings towards the situation but at the same time I know that they are all right...I just hate this shit...why does it have to hurt so bad....."

Next I turn to a pile of mail: on top is another letter requesting money from Bush, under a few more letters from Bush and one or two from John Thune- I find 10 magazines(all with my name on them).
1. WIRED: the wonderful world of PIXAR
2. WIRED: the future of food
3. Newsweek: Nancy's Story
4. TIME: Faith, God, and the Oval Office
5. Standard Weekly: The Connection(between Iraq and al Qaeda)
6. Standard Weekly: Radio Silence(how NPR purged classical music from its airways)
7. Science News (overfertilization)
8. Science News (lovely above, deadly below)
9. Scientific American: will GENE DOPING change the nature of sport?
10. American Girl- yes thats right, I still get it. 

and on top of that reading that built up over one week's absense- I also have a Wall Street or two to read."

Peter Piper Pizza
1239 E McKellips Rd
Mesa, AZ 85203 

Lets make it Friday then- at 11:30am
I was thinking to make it a surprise..(he isn't allowd on the internet, so he shouldn't be able to read this) if may some chance his stupid parents get in the way- then it may end up not being a surprise

I am not exactly sure how much pizza is(debbie help me out)but I would say- everyone bring 5 dollars for pizza and I will cover the cake.

so pass this message along.

"event","The life of Ronald Reagan does not need to be fabricated in falsity to exhibit its greatness.  Reagan remains to be a president that I believe does not have the honor he deserves of his country.  After all, Reagan was the most consequential president since Franklin Roosevelt, the most successful Republican leader since Theodore Roosevelt, and the first true conservative to reach the apex of American politics since Coolidge. Reagan won the Cold War almost without firing a shot; he laid the groundwork for the GOP to escape half a century of minority status; and he decisively vindicated the claims of conservatism.
To list the achievements of Ronald Reagan would take far more time than I have today.  I think one thing is clear though- Ronald Reagan was the voice of America and will live in memory as one of America's greatest presidents."

"event","<P>I watched Matrix Revolutions a few nights ago- and I was so surprised..it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Maybe this is beacause I didn't have high expectations for it at all but still... I thought it drew the story together nicely. And it cleared up all the confusion from Reloaded. I really enjoyed looking at this site: <A href=""http://wylfing.net/essays/matrix_revolutions.html"">http://wylfing.net/essays/matrix_revolutions.html</A>&nbsp;it really explained the movie- and made me realize that every line in the movies had a point (well almost every line).&nbsp; You know what was REALLY cool was that Revolutions main theme was choices.&nbsp; And I think the whole choices theme is summed up with Dumbledore's words: It is our choices far more than our abilities that show who we are. (awesome quote to think about- because in a religious sense you can also think about how God grants man 'free will' - which is <U>choice</U>)</P>

There she blows.&nbsp; It seems recently that my mind is always buzzing.&nbsp; There are so many thoughts I am very aware are floating around, sometimes peeking around the corner of my brain tissue and occasionally giving the temple above my right eye a nice hard poke.&nbsp; There are of course the usual thoughts swimming around like me taking notice to the fact that my toenails seem to be growing at a tremendous rate these days, or thought number 4,132 who is keeping count of how many times Jackie says ""Ah Honestly"".&nbsp; I would like to point out now, that none of these thoughts are ""random""--I happen to know for a fact that my brain is a perfectly organized filing cabinet(..the only problem is, I forgot to label the files).&nbsp; But among these regular thoughts however there are the always the thought files that are brought out suddenly from a storage room somewhere that I thought I lost the key to.&nbsp; So now that you know how my mind works, please to NOT consider it random as I go on a spiel on the Day of Silence and Earth Day:</P>
<P>Every year, there are always at least a couple of students who walk into class holding the little signs announcing that they would not be speaking that day in order to create awareness of the silent suffering gay students endure. Inevitably, someone asks what it's all about, prompting the teacher to explain. And in their explanation, they have to make crystal clear that no one is to harass or otherwise demean the participants in any way. This is the responsibility of a teacher and one with which I agree. However, it is this very scenario that those who promote the homosexual agenda in the schools have in mind. Teachers, no matter what their views on homosexuality, have to stand before the class and give sermons on the evils of gay bashing. Some will even go further and preach the acceptance of the gay lifestyle. As a result, the National Day of Silence succeeds in creating a perception of unity among school faculties on the issue of Gay Rights. </P>
<P>How should it be? Call me crazy, but the job of the teacher is to teach the subject he, she or it has been hired to teach. Interrupting my lesson on the Marshall Plan with a ten to twenty minute explanation and discussion of the ""silence"" does nothing to help my retention challenged students learn about the reconstruction of post World War II Europe and its impact on the Cold War. Here's an idea: punish students who, for whatever reason, harass or otherwise demean fellow students. Do so in the effort to create a safe, secure learning environment for all students, not to imply approval of the Gay Rights agenda. No special day is needed to achieve this goal--just caring, competent teachers. </P>
<P>As for Earth Day, most people believe environmental conditions are only fair to poor. And the President of the United States feels obligated to tout his environmental record every April 22. I doubt, however, if very many are inspired enough by the day to go out and hug a tree or to put the environment at the top of their list of reasons to vote for their favorite candidate. <BR>While they are telling me the earth is not, at the least I know my mind is.<BR></P>"

"event","It seems I have forgotten about live journal completely over the last few days.  I have most certainly gone this long with out posting before but you see I have always checked my friends entries and thought about updating.  But tonight as I sit down at 1:30 in the morning getting ready to tell you about my week I realize my long absence and wonder why lj hasn't been nagging at me to post like it usually does, this is probably due to me not having any time to think about live journal.  hmm..At any rate:
Thursday night= choir concert.  It was decent.. better than I expected.
Friday= Risk.  I wish I could say it was a glorious victory but unfortunately it was quite the opposite on my part.
After getting picked up by my dad I found they were going to Troy so I tagged along.  (I actually saw you at the theater Erin- but the previews were already starting so I didn't bother waving a hello across the theater)
I am very glad I went..the movie was worth seeing. There were some interesting and annoying aspects to the film.  
I thought the movie made good use of sound.  For example most of the gore wasn't carried out visually but through sound.
I think the way the movie had the audience rooting for both sides- or at the least introducing main characters on both sides- was cool.
The ending is not pleasant and I don't think I would walk out yelling for joy-- but everyone that dies, everything that happened was necessary and if it didnt happen the movie would be ruined.
Keep that in mind when I complain about Orlando beind the most pitiful disgraced character(crawling away from all dignity and hugging your brothers feet? I am ashamed). 

It is now Saturday night (I began this  post Friday night/this morning).  I have spent 7 hours at the Library working on projects with Brooke, Andrew, and Brian. *sigh* 

I am tired..I want only to lay down and intake the aroma of my conditioner."

"event","Well it is Thursday (finally).  This was a slow week that was sped up by some excitment about ""big"" secrets.  It turns out the events of Tuesday didn't really create circle that seperated the novices.  Or if it did- it only did so for a short amount of time--You see what Dumbledore says about the ways of passing information within the Order (""I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge's office"")holds true not only for the Order but also for the Novices(whoa.  did I just make a connection between the Novies and the Order?).  So after much uneeded but amusing and intense mayhem- we are all on the same page again.  

In other news my aunt is in town- she is awesome.  She has a great sense of style- just like my sister.   I just tag along to their fashion sense..I dont actually have any myself.


So this weekend: Banquet, then read ""Typical American"", then spend time w/my Aunt UNLESS she decided to go with the rest of my family hiking and I don't go...in that case I would say movie Saturday..anybody?  but I won't know yet if I can...so yeah"

I turned down two offers to go out this weekend in the hopes to clean my room.  But the attempt was in vain.  I come before you now with a messy room.  
I suppose the problem is that I don't clean- I organize, I change, I make, I fix, I mix, and alas I am back to a messy room (more so than when I started).

I watched ""Brave New Girl"" on ABC tonight.  There were pluses and minuses.  Besides a few inaccurate demonstrations of classical music and how important training is for a voice- it did hint at the need for classical Italian and depending on how you look at it you could see the end showing that training is necessary- then after that, comes talent to shine through.  That is how I interpreted the final song.  And I loved it. I replayed the song 3 times."

Well, I surrender.  I am guilty.  In order to fulfill my obligation to ""live life to its fullest"" I try to give back..To create.  I would be tempted to consider myself an artist so I sit down and attempt to paint, but I get lost in..oh I dont know..everything.  Everything- from the history book lying open displaying another world ages ago, to the computer screen with an endless Internet of distractions.  And getting deeper and deeper into thought I never get back to what I wanted to do.  I don't have ADD(haahaa..or if I do this example isn't it) because after looking at other artists- other times- other places-our world today-I dont want to come back to what I was doing because it feels insignificant.  I feel like a small blade of grass in the lawn of life.  And honestly I dont feel like I should give myself-such a tiny wild thing- such a power as a paintbrush, until I have grown to see more than the mass of green smothering me.

"event","Okay, I have some news that may be shocking... it may even scare you a bit.  You see I ran across a statistic today that is very startling-here it goes:
 Studies have shown that 10 in 10 people die.

Yes, that is correct.  You have no way of escaping it.  The funny thing is- that is all people try to do.  Because of a fear of death, they try to run away from it.  They try to stay young as long as possible. They are constantly saying, ""Life moves too fast!"".  The problem with that statement is that people then try get ""get as much life as possible"" because it ""moves to fast"".  The thing is- life moves at the right pace. And if you feel it is getting away from you then you need not try to runaway from it, but rather invest in what is truly life.  And what is ""truly life"" I suppose would vary from person to person.  But for myself I know that I need not fear death for it is not the end of life."

"event","Now that the frenzy of Speech has drawn to a close I have found myself coming home actually before 4:30 (imagine that)with the regular routine of turning on my computer (with the intention of posting- but notice I never do), listening to a few good songs, falling asleep for about two hours (yes that is right. nap time. how can I sleep so much? no idea, I suppose I am a sleep-whore.. except with out the er-yeah), then eating supper, doing home work, watching a show/drawing/reading, and once again going back to sleep.  
So when Barchilon begs to do something after school and argues- with always the reoccurring question: what are you going home and doing? there you go. that is it.

I am glad we have Friday off.  Due to Speech, Science, and random trips across the country (NY) I haven't gotten in anywhere near a full week of school since spring break.  So really it will feel normal having Friday off.  Oh speech, I miss you and you making us have 3-4 day weeks.  

I still haven't made any contact with the organization that does nothing(NHS) yet I think I was suppose to, shame on me.

Oh yeah, so Thursday (tomorrow night) is DV's showcase... I am interested in going.  I will either get a ride from my mum or hitch a ride from any one of you that is willing.  Speaking of showcases.. can't wait till April 16th and 17th. 
Friday.  Laser Quest, movie, campfire? (chris you didn't read that. it is all an illusion.)

"event","It is 11:20.  I have just gotten home from the airport.  I still have to read chapters 4-12 of Grapes of Wrath. I still have to start a study guide with quesitons on each chapter.  I am still on the NY time zone which would mean it is 1:30am.  I have to wake up early (6:00).  I still have latin songs and cheesy bus songs from 4 days of choir ""fun"" stuck in my head.  And what do I do? I rush to my computer to smother a small scream when I see that RM placed 4th.  I was updated up to sems(I got Jackie's message-we were performing so I couldnt have my phone on).  But there was no message for finals so it ate away at me for 2 days.  I was thrilled Barchilon broke(he worked so hard on that stupid peice-if he didnt get anything out of it, then it would be a crime),Jackie double broke(sweet!) Bobby is a Pimp I guess(so I have heard), Erin mega-broke, a bunch of other pple did great, and rm placed 4th(brilliant!)
So I had an ok time- I mean I am in NY I am not going to sulk..although I did annoy everyone by talking about or connecting things to speech non-stop. for ex. I see: homeless people-and that turns into a long conversaiton(to no one) about Berkely. 
Oh we got 2nd place gold at the competition(how does that work? I fdont know-dont ask.)*sigh* I few random good times(it is ny after all) but I kept thinking, ""if only _______ was here""(fill that blank in with your name).
well I better head off--once again I am so happy for rm state!!"

Cauron is politizing Harry Potter in typical liberal fasion but he at least got Harry's(or Dan's) hair right. (it is FINALLY) messed up. and it looks good!

"event","Well, this was a nice week including popcorn and passion, a conspiracy that I didn't pick up on, and ending with the Academy Awards.


1.  The passion.  It opened on ash wednesday, had a good friday, and a better saturday.  (My compliments to the lame jokes of the Academy Awards)  But truly Mel used his own money to sponsor the movie and he underwent many personal attacks(one of them being the attack against his father[who denied the Holocaust ever happening] but Mel has acknowledged numerous times that his father has  all-timers and that he has mental problems), so I am glad it did well.  I have been hearing from certain people that they think the movie is anti-sematic.  I don't want to give away the ending or anything- but obviously because Jesus is a Jew and he is resurrected(which the movie shows) therefore conquering the task he was born to do, the movie is not anti-sematic.

2. The Conspiracy.  Thank you everyone: Debbie(my sista), Jackie who has now ensured random good times at cold stone and as long as Chris doesn't get hold of them-good times with the green m&ms, Erin and Steve for a crack on Bush and Unfinished tales, Shane and Jill for contributing to my GAPiness, Steven who has enriched my  life with Best in Show and a *cough*enjoyable?*cough* Abercrombie poster, Nick for Dune and books that tell me how to carry out my  evil plans....and because this is oddly seeming like the thank yous at the Oscars I think I will end it now.

3.  Well I am watching the Oscars...Into the West-as steven would say, ""so good!"", 3 out of 3 so far for ROTK.... oh and yay for Pink Panther!"

"event","3 well earned high fives(due to moments of brilliance[nice, no..overly nice, I think I got something and yes there is a ring!point!]), 2 cups of ice cream, and one cold stone server that couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.

After practice Jackie/Jaci and I had random Harry Potter discussions at cold stone.  I was holding the OotP(5th Hp book) and this little girl(about 8) in the cutest and most excited voice asked me what page I was on.  I wasn't really thinking, I guess, of what it meant to a little girl because I plainly replied, ""I have finished it 23 times."" The girl looked taken aback, it wasn't until I walked out that it hit me how that could sound almost snobbish... oh well.
Passion tomorrow. yay. I heard about the lady in her 50s in Kansas that died during one of the graphic parts.  I can perfectly understand that happening because I have heard first of all she wasn't too well that day(meaning she could have been light headed had heart problems or breathing problems to begin with) second of all I don't know what she believed spiritually about the movie but I can see that if she was really religious that seeing the movie could of hit her hard...

In other more comical news my mom told me that she had to talk to this kid at safeway for an 30min about gay marriage(he brought it up), and while talking my mom finds out that this kid is gay, goes to rm, and *drum roll* is president of the German club!!!(ahh, it is Mr.creepy-Jackie-almost-killed-gay-german-president-library-boy!) So, I thought that was interesting."

"event","It has been thrown out there in a few comments to posts, but now officially I would like to ask if anyone wants to go with me to see ""The Passion of Christ"".  It is an account of the final 12 hours of Christ's pre-resurrected life.  It is produced and directed by Mel Gibson and it portrays the brutal truth about how Christ suffered physically on the cross.  The movie is rated 'R' due to violent content..do you have to be 18-or w/ someone 18- to buy tickets for r movies?or 16? as of tomorrow I will be 16. good for me.  
Anyway, I want to go Wednesday..but I dont know how tickets will work out(I know churches are renting out entire theaters, so I guessing the public ones will be packed)...so either a weekday or Saturday.
Whether or not (according to C.S. Lewis theory) you believe Jesus was Lunatic, Liar, or Lord.. I think it will be an interesting movie."

"event","Are you a Democrat or Republican

1) What is your personal income level? Is it: 
- Too much!
- Not enough money, but any more would make me evil.
- Whatever the government lets me keep.
- Money is a tool of the capitalistic overclass which etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
- I have no income. I've rejected money and illegally inhabit a national park. 

2) Describe your family: 
- I'm married with three kids. Oh, and a live-in transsexual who joins us in our orgies.
- The rules of the commune prohibit disclosing personal information.
- I don't believe in families.
- I don't believe in the word ""describe."" 

3) What is the most politically incorrect thing about Scooby Doo? 
- Daphne never does anything but stand around and look pretty.
- Scooby was never referred to as a Canine-American.
- Velma is such a lesbian stereotype.
- Shaggy never shares his marijuana.
- ""Scooby Snack"" reward system encourages mass consumption.
- Criminals are actually put in prison. 

4) There's this weird drunk hanging out in front of your home. Do you: 
- Give him two bucks and think highly of 
- Direct him to a government agency that will help him.
- Start a government agency that will help him.
- Respect his personal choice.
- Give Senator Kennedy a ride home. 

5) I'm against school vouchers because... 
- Bad teachers need jobs too!
- The NEA is against it and a labor union certainly wouldn't do anything in its own interest.
- A monopoly always yields better results than competition. 

6) Bill Clinton's Welfare Reform Policy is: 
- A document with ""GOP"" scribbled out & ""Bill's"" written in with a fat purple magic marker.
- ""It's a trap that discourages work & rewards illegitimacy and we're keeping it.""
- What would you like it to be?
- What time is it? 

7) Bill Clinton's Official Drug Policy is: 
- Whatever the Republicans are currently working on.
- A new poster: ""Don't Be A Shaggy; Share Your Drugs!""
- White House aides using drugs won't be allowed to work unless they're Democrats.
- ""Just say no to inhaling!""
- What would you like it to be?
- What time is it? 

8) Why do you admire Hillary Clinton? 
- Anyone who can make $100K without knowing cattle futures deserves admiring.
- The only dead people I can conjure up are Paul Lynde and Redd Foxx.
- If only I could lie so convincingly!
- Hey! She puts up with Bill! Give her some credit.
- We need more strong, intelligent women in prison. 

9) What would Bill Clinton have to do for you to not vote for him? 
- Develop a big ugly eyestalk in the middle of his forehead.
- Appear in a remake of ""Bedtime for Bonzo.""
- Claim to be ""more famous than JFK!""
- Wear a t-shirt showing a bullet-riddled Snoopy.
- Join the Republican party. 

10) If Bill and Hillary discovered _________ in Chelsea's room, they would disown her. ONLY ONE ANSWER IS CORRECT. 
- Condoms.
- Marijuana.
- Cocaine.
- A videotape with a note: ""It was fun! Here's a copy--Rob Lowe""
- An antique German lampshade with a registration tattoo on it.
- ""The Way Things Oughta Be"" by Rush Limbaugh. 

11) Al Gore's dynamic speech pattern makes him an excellent choice for the position of: 
- Vice President. 
- President. 
- Governor. 
- Senator. 
- Environmental spokesman. 
- TalkieToy Robot recorded voice.
- Kindergarten teacher. 

12) Bill Clinton strongly believes in: 
- Bill Clinton. 
- Bill Clinton. 
- Bill Clinton. 
- Bill Clinton. 

13) There is a logical, believable way that missing Whitewater documents showed up in the White House reading room that adjoins Hillary's office after the administration claimed to have handed over all relevant documents: 
- They were being used to line Sock's box.
- Time-traveling KGB spies plotting to avenge the fall of communism.
- They had been blank sheets of paper until Bill spilled lemon juice on them.
- That rascally David Copperfield again!
- Hillary had them. 

SCORING: None. IF you think this is a humor page, you're a Republican. IF you had a hard time picking the best answer because they're all so true, you're a Democrat."

"event","Nature isn't as they used to say in the 1960s, my bag.  I've known this for quite some time but realized it afresh when studiously doing research for LD and its wonderful topic, and when searching in all my procrastination for my OO and only finding Hippies telling me to ""Love Your Mother""(earth) or to ""Hug a Tree"".  No thanks, not for me.  I consider nature best viewed from a window in a comfortable house. The major American writer that least interests me(with his lengthy descriptions of nature) is Thoreau.  I enjoy a beautiful sunrise/sunset though not for long(the sun is not meant to be stared at).  All I wish to say is nature can be overrated and overdone.  Maybe I am cynical.  Maybe I am just realistic.  Maybe I am not very er-""emo""(although I think I still lack a complete understanding of what would be 'emo') But come on, let's call a nice scene a nice scene, and get back to work.  All I ask is to be spared the sentimentality of nature lovers."

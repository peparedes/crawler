But why is that... what is so special about humans in the first place that we can move... are we just dolls with a set battery life, and when that runs out, we cease to move... What is that special thing humans... animals have that allows us to do that... If we really truely have souls... then what's keeping it inside our bodies.......

I thought of that two days ago. Can anyone answer that for me? You religious people, or anti-religious people... lets see what you have to say...

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

"event","Tonight... today I should say, other than the fact that I have the equivalent of 80 16.9 oz bottles of mountain dew in me, the caffine ammount at least, was... I don't even know. God so much has happened... In the past 12 hours... I've done so much... I spent about the past 11 with Nikki... At first we were at my house alone, then Jason and Lila borrowed dans car to come pick up up, and we went to the chinese resturant. We got food, I started my ""tab"" meaning I'm just gonna pay on wed.. And then came back here to dans. Since we were picked up by Jason and Kalila, I've been in a horribly off mood....I would get really depressed or really pissed... it just wast good. Then Amanda got mad at me saying that I've been a jerk to her the past few days, which isn't true. I was being mean today but I said sorry and she stiffed me. Fine. So I went upstairs and lied down for a while, Nikki came up and we talked a bit, then went back downstairs because I was getting really depressed again and figured I should try it out. We sat here on the computer because I wanted to show her something... then a little after mike and amanda left, I just started bawling. Fuck I'm starting to again right now... I just sat there with her on my lap crying my eyes out for probably a half hour. I would stop, listen to a song, and start again. Fuck I looked at the name of the song and started bawling, before I even had my headphones off. I got alot of it out, but there's still so much more... and I need to get it out and I don't know how. I hate crying, and I hate them I'm ready to right now. I need Nikki with me... I need the protection she gives me.. I need... I need everything she has. She just... I don't know I can't explain it. Just being with her, I feel comfortable with anything... but I feel like such an asshole because I'm starting to become who I was... I'm starting to go psychotic again... I'm snapping at people again, I'm getting murderous thoughts, suicidal tendencys, deep depression, calm and collective. I'm either Bi-Polar or I'm Skitzophrenic. Either way I don't want that to happen. So I tried to figure things out, and after bawling my eyes out and talking about the different things which only made me cry more, IE my grandma and Cleo, I realized why I'm starting to slip again. I'm working at the very place I learned my grandma died. My spiritual psyche has known it but tried to hit it from mental self since I started, and it's starting to break. So I'm already gonna start finding a new job because I can't take that, but I'll work there until I do find one. What else? God so much of this night is just, blank. I played ALOT of Hacky-Sack at bowling tonight, had many games, then on the way to drop Nikki and Kalila off I started to slip into insanity, as I was dreaming while awake because I was crashing.  Now that I'm eating though I'm wide awake, which sucks because I have work in 13 hours. I need to goto bed but I'm afraid....   Nikki I love you, I miss you, I need you... Whens the next time I can see you, and no matter when  you say won't be soon enough. I love you so much... Thank you for putting up with me."

"event","Kristi, Since I know you still somehow get information out of my livejournal, then this one goes to you. I know I told your mom that you'd get your money within a month but that has to change now, as something a bit more important has come up. You will still get your money but it's going to be within the next two months now.  Karen is selling her car for 300$$ and its first come first serve. And since I need a car, well, that takes 	precedence. Don't worry you'll still get your money, and if you're going to complain or bitch in any way, just remember that I'm being nice enough to even pay you, seeing as if I wanted I could just say ""Fuck you"" and not pay, since none of its in writing. So I'll say this again, you bitch or complain once after hearing this new information, I'm going to say screw it and not pay you. You've been warned, and you've been told.


Now onto the actual update. As mentioned above I will HOPEFULLY be getting a car soon. I mean come on, 300$$ for a stick shift that gets 40 miles to the gallon... pretty bad ass. Just gotta wait 3 weeks for paychecks... Since I know I didn't update about this, I now have a job at Pizza hut. Unfortunately, the second day I was scheduled to work I called in sick because I felt like shit last night and this morning, and ended up sleeping until 2:30. I woke up maybe 4 times but that was to move from the chair to the floor, the floor to another chair, and then to the bed. So needless to say after waking up and feeling like shit, I called in sick. He said it was ok but to call 3 hours in advanced next time, which I said I understood. Hopefully this won't effect my schedule for next week. If I get significantly less than what I got this week I'll be a little mad, seeing as they had me scheduled for about 32 hours my first week. Now it should go down to about 28 since I missed my only 4 hour shift, all other shifts are 3 - close. They close at 10 and we get out around 10:30 - 11, and with a half hour break that makes 7 hours a day. But you're all smart and can add so. Either way, hopefully I get about the same next week because that would be bullshit if I got less hours my second week, and if I do then I probably won't be able to get the car after 3 weeks. I figure I'll buy it and just leave it there until I can get insurance and get my license. Which I still have to do but, eh whatever. I'll ask my mom to pay for my 5 hour and whatever else I need.

On a different, better subject, yesterday was quite an amazing day. I got to spend a lot of time with Nikki, she met my family at Nicky's birthday party, and then we just had a great night. I really love her so much. She's amazing. And other than smoking, which I swear I'm giving up starting tonight at midnight, I've given up under aged drinking and all drugs for her. She just makes me feel so happy, and drugs and drinking just depress me. I love her so much... I really hope I can give up smoking for her, but hey I haven't bought a pack yet have I? So I figure it should be easy. Can't become like family... Can't become like family... No! I won't be like them. No more! Promise this time. 100% Giving up. I'm making the promise to you this time, I'm done with it all. You love means more to me. I know you say you're ok with it but I know it bothers you, so for you I'm giving it up. Sweetheart you mean the world to me. Just know I'm always here for you whenever you need something I'll be here. I guess since none of you have school this week I'll get to stay at dans every night, so that I can talk to you more. Other than having to work every day, lets see what Thursday on brings. If I have but a single day off I want to see you all day, no matter what it means. I'll think of something to tell your parents, I'm already formulating a plan. Mwahaha, I love being a master strategist. Or would it be Tactician? Either way, you all know what I mean.  Hmm... so anything else new in my life? Not that I can think of. Just the fact that I'm having never ending thoughts about you sweetheart. Maybe I should look into that 5 hour soon... Figure out what I have to do and what not."

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Welcome to Gateway Remote Assistance. My name and badge number are Ray_GWPR132. I am looking at your account and the information you submitted. I will begin troubleshooting with you in just a moment. Please note that I can also answer any upgrade questions you have.

James Travers says:
Alright. Incident? What the heck?

James Travers says:
Ignore that please, just speaking aloud to myself.

James Travers says:
Also, please take your time in responses, I'm in no hurry.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Hello James

Ray_GWPR132 says:
How are you doing?

James Travers says:
Pretty good considering.

James Travers says:
and yourself?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Doing Great, Thanks for aksing james

James Travers says:
You're quite welcome.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
\According to your submission, the serial number for your Gateway system is 0024891896 and the system ship date was 9/22/2001 and the warranty expired. Is this correct?

James Travers says:
Yeah I guess so. My brother gave this computer to my mom, who gave it to my grandpa, who gave it to me... So I'm assuming all of that is correct.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
OH i see.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
In addition, the system originally came with 128 MB of memory. Did they may any upgrade already?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
*made...

James Travers says:
Yes I upgraded it myself. But all this is just technical stuff that has nothing to do with my problem, not trying to be rude. I'm not one who likes to dance around whats important. I like to get to the point

Ray_GWPR132 says:
That's Great, hope you understand that we need to follow some rules here..

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Anyway...

Ray_GWPR132 says:
I've read your issue description from the submission form.  Do you have any more details that may help us?

James Travers says:
Ah yes, forgive my rudeness once again.

James Travers says:
Acctually I do... Before I do go into that though, do you mind if I ask one question? It might answer my problem for me.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Sure, please...

James Travers says:
What exactly does the Scroll Lock button do? I've tried to figure it out and it just appears to be a useless key.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
IT's for the windows Scroll......

James Travers says:
Would you mind going into a little more detail for me?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
When you press that.. it should lock the scroll. but mostly that button do not work at all. to lock scroll.....

James Travers says:
Ah. Well that doesn't help solve my problem so, I guess lets dive right in. If you don't mind that is.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Sure, James, may i know what's happening to your Keyboard?

James Travers says:
Well. The reason I asked about the scroll lock is because of the light. AS you are well aware, each lock button has a light that goes with it, which lights up when that particular lock is on. My problem is, that since the scroll lock button has no purpose, I was trying to ""destroy"" the scroll lock light and, after much trial, I was unsuccessful after a half hour. Now In place of it is a mound of glue, as I had to fill in the hole I made with it, yet the light still persists on staying on.

James Travers says:
So I guess my problem is, I can't manage to get the light to perminately stay off without ridding myself of the scroll lock key itself.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Okay, oh gee, James when you try to press the Scroll lock key again, won't the light turn off?

James Travers says:
That isn't the problem. I mean I know that if I hit the Scroll Lock key the light will turn off... But the thing is, I don't want the light to even be there. So that when I do hit the scroll lock key again in the future, no light turns on for it at all, thus making me a happy boy who can sleep easier at night.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
HMMM? that is not possible,,. What i suggest is to get a black  electrical tape and put it on top of the light, or buy a new keyboard with no scroll lock key, your current  keyboard is designed that way James..

James Travers says:
Well that's a bit unfair... I mean I didn't buy this keyboard like that. Either way, are there any other suggestions besides buying a new keyboard or using electrical tape that you might have?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Try this..... do hit the scroll lock key again ... EVER ....in the future, no light will turn on if you don't press on it...

James Travers says:
Or, what I meant to say was, I wasn't around when this keyboard was purchased, but I do believe that There was no choice for a different keyboard when this computer system was bought.

James Travers says:
Well, what about taking the keyboard apart and just taking out that part of the light? Would that work?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
You can do that if you really want to mess the keyboard apart. James, the light on top of the Scroll, num and caps lock are designed as a symbol that these keys are active (when lights are on) and inactive otherwise

James Travers says:
Well I understand that, I'm just saying I don't like it and think that the next time someone purchases one of your Computer Units they should have the option of getting a keyboard without one of the scroll lock lights on it for free...

Ray_GWPR132 says:
If you can check, there are screws at the bottom of the keyboard, and you can do that if you wish, however, I cannot guarantee you that it won't cause any harm to the entire keyboard James. 

James Travers says:
I already shocked myself when I stabbed it with a screwdriver... I suppose I'll try that when I get home.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Oh try to do that when your Tower (Computer) is off,.also unplug the cable keyboard from the back of your tower

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Is there any other concern that i can help you with?

James Travers says:
Yes! There is one other thing.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Yes?

James Travers says:
I've noticed that Gateway computers, in general, are very uncompatible with other parts. None of the stock components can be over clocked, the ram that my MoBo uses is very hard to find, the video card is pretty bad for being stock, the regular harddrive is rather small compared to other computers made around the same time, and I've also noticed the computer in its own to be rather slow compared to all others made around the same time, and this remained true even after I completely reformatted and reinstalled Windows XP. Why is that?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
When you have all these upgrade inquiries, have you ever contacted sales or technical support so that we can assist you on the exact part/s that you want James?

And also, as you can notice in the support documents base on your serial number, there is a hyperlink there that says Find upgrades and it will take you directly to the Gateway link on what to consider in purchasing.

James Travers says:
Thats just it though, I don't particularly like my Gateway tower enough to Upgrade it. In the ammount of money my family paid for it I could build a computer with close to 500 times the power and capabilities than this one.

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Is there anything else that i can help you with?

James Travers says:
One last thing. Had I brought up my dislike for this keyboard when it was under warrenty, would I've been able to get a new one for free?

Ray_GWPR132 says:
Yes, new same one, The warranty replace the exact same parts of your computer James.

James Travers says:
Damn... well that blows... would've had to do the same thing to that one. Well Alright thank you, You've fulfilled all my questions

Ray_GWPR132 says:
It was a pleasure working with you. My name and badge number are Ray_GWPR132. Thank you for using Gateway Remote Assistance and have a great day.

"event","Alright so let me give a quick update, since its been god knows how long since. In fact, lets make it a numbered list and then explain it all in paragraphs below.

1) Stopped dating Nadine
2) Started dating Nikki
3) Stopped dating Crystal
4) Went to a party, played Beer Pong, won
5) Nikki spent the night after bowling
6) Sort of have a job
7) Learned we lost the high quality job down in NO
8) Leaving either the 24, 25, or 26
9) Finally found my Jack Hat
10) Giving up Marijuanna and Cigarettes

SO... Any questions? Ok, lets get started.

   So, January 2nd I met Nikki, one month ago today acctually. When I met her, I kinda, well... That part doesn't matter. So I started talking to her on AIM and after a while we hit it off. So I ended up leaving Nadine, and after about a week, Me and Nikki started to date. Yeah, shut up, its not alot of details because again, a month ago. Nigger... Ok! Moving on... so about a week into dating Nikki, Crystal and I split. So then nothing really big happened, and then came last friday. Jason, Jake, Dan and I went to this party in Holly, NY at Jason's friend Alyson's house. It was fucking awesome. Jason and I played Beer Pong, and we owned, even though Alyson and her gf Jess had already played 3 games. Pretty much I got trashed, smoked like 4 or 5 cigs, and then came back home at night without Jason, he had stayed to party. Saturday we picked up Nikki, and went to bowling, which Chelsea ruined... fucking bitch. So we're all boycotting bowling tomorrow and going to LQ instead. Anyways, so that night, Nikki got to sleep over, and lets just say it was the best I've slept in a very long time... I miss having someone to sleep with, thats why I can't wait for her to graduate so we can goto MCC together and get an apartment together. Ok, Moving on again. You guys all know Gourmet House in Titus plaza. Well I sorta have a job there, if they need help they call me, and I get food and money. I made 8 bucks today and got free food. Where was I, Oh yeah ok. So that's my sorta job. Now I learned that the guy who we were going to work for is leaving before we get there, so we dont have that bitching job anymore. But we are still going down there, we're going for 2 weeks, and if we find nothing in that time then we're coming right back. So, I guess I'll either be gone for 2 weeks or alot longer if we find work. *sigh* Now on to some good news. I finally found my Jack hat, after only 30 days of missing it! Hoorah Jack hat! And I've come to a final conclusion about life choices. I'm going to be giving up Marijuanna and cigarettes for the rest of my life. See how I came to this decision is, when I'd get high I'd get all... depressed and shit, but when I'm with Nikki, I feel so alive and so happy, even hearing her voice, talking to her on the phone gets me feeling like that. So I've no reason to smoke since I have her. And the cigs, well those are just bad for me, so no more of that. So there you have it, my life since I last posted. And with that, I'll say one last thing.

I love you Nicole Killian, more than anything in exsistance today. I'll never stop loving you baby, you make me feel perfect."

By ""Asked"" to leave I was Demanded to leave, there was no asking done, and by saying I was going to wait to talk to the security guards boss. Also the cops had been called WAY before I had even been talked to. So also because of all this I get to goto court and just be like, whatever man. They didn't read me my rights, just handcuffed me and made me go with him. Ugh cop cars suck man, the seats are plastic man. So ok apparently this country has a problem with loyalty to friends. So I wasn't read my rights, I have to go to court and explain all this and pay 50$$ to 100$$  for getting let off this time. Also I'm banned for 3 months from greece mall. It was almost all the malls in monroe county but luckily its not, so I can still chill with Dan, Tiff, Zack, Nikki, and J sunday."

"event","Tonight was... undeniably the worst night so far. On top of getting really depressed, like... Crystal leaving me depressed, I got so incredibly pissed off. Hell I think I lost a few friends. Basicly tonight was bad. But once I took that walk to Jeff's, other than the few minutes of longing for the past, though not really *its complicated*, I don't remember any of the walk except for the last 5 minutes. At Jeff's, we watched clerks, badass movie, and then Pure Pwnage episode 9. It was pretty sweet. Then Jeff showed me one of his finals which was really good and then I showed him Real life vrs the Internet. We had a good laugh, then in the car ride home, a very nice, calm talk. Now I'm home and going to play PSO, hopefully find that cool armor. I love this candle <33... So glad I subconciouslly picked calming."

"event","A child has a crefew throughout his life. Though, I believe that a child's curfew should be handled in a different way then it is normally delt with. A child needs control during certian parts of his or her life, though also at critical points they need freedom, more than is given on a normal basis. Though, it is in my current belief system that I have found a way to properly control a child, while still giving him or her the necassary freedom to grow as a normal child. For the first twelve years of a childs life, their curfew should be half their age. This means that at 6 PM, a twelve year old child should be in his or her home. Why I ended it at twelve though, is because when a child becomes a teenager, they need more freedom and more control then their previous state. Once a child becomes the state of a teenager, their curfew should be extended one hour. So, keeping with the same system as before, a 13 year old child's curfew would be that of seven o'clock. How I got to that conclusion, is once they're a teenager, it is impossible to get them to realize that there are still half hour's when it comes to the concept of time. So, as you can guess, when they're fourteen, the curfew would be 8, fifteen the curfew would be 9, and at sixteen the curfew would be ten. You may be wondering if, say, eleven is to late for a seventeen year old, but remember this... When a teenager is 17, it's the last year they really have before they can get in serious trouble. The last year they really have before everything they've grown up with comes crashing down and reality hits. Once a child turns 18, the curfew is thrown out the window because in the United States, the age of 18 makes you a legal adult. At this point in life you graduate high school, start college, start work, but most importantly, start the age in which you can get arrested and held in jail for x ammount of time. So although as a parent, you try to set limits on your child, you must learn that the only way for a human to learn right from wrong in this day and age is to let them make their own mistakes, but always be there to back them up and catch them when they fall, because remember, even if they don't say it, every child will always love their mother and father for bringing them into this world, not matter how bad of a state it's in, because being alive is one of the greatest feelings of all time. I know at times we all fight with our parents, but as children we have to remember that our parents are that, OUR parents. They've done everything we could imagine and more, and if you don't believe me ask them yourselves. You can ask your mom and dad if they've ever tried pot, and they will tell you the truth. The thing we as kids don't realize is that if you ask someone a question, they will usually give us a straight truthful answer, because having the courage to ask someone a question is not an easy thing to achieve. So I emplore you, please please please ask your parents questions. Ask your brothers and sisters. The thing is, they won't get mad at your for asking something, but rather be shocked and give you an honest answer.  I've talked to both my older sister and my older brother about alot of things. And I've gotten so much help from them, all because I asked. It was because of my brother and sister that I have decided to attend college for the spring semester.

Good now I'm done cause I got distracted."

1. My username is ____ because ____.
2. My journal is titled ____ because ____.
3. My subtitle is ____ because ____.
4. My friends page is called ____ because ____.
5. My default userpic is ____ because ____.

1. My username is PSO_RAmar_Largo, because I have a large infatuation with Phantasy Star Online. The RAmar part stands for my charecters class, which is Male Ranger, and Largo is my charecters name. The reason I choose Largo is because of MegaTokyo, you can ask anyone, I am Largo. Yes I know I can't spell charecter either.

2. My Journal is titled Life of a Ninja RAmar, because my PSO charecter Largo, looks like a ninja. And since he is a representation of me, and he is a ninja ramar, I am a ninja ramar, and my LJ tells the story of my life from my mouth.

3. My subtitle is.... I don't know....

4. My friends page is called Hunters Guild. It also is from Phantasy Star Online, the hunters guild is where you go to get quests.

5. My default userpic is a picture of Ed from Full Metal Alchemist looking into the distance. I chose this because FMA is one of my favorite shows, and a while back I was having a... well an Unpleasent moment in my life *read about 10 posts back maybe?* That I was remaining hopeful and dedicated to a certain someone, and this Icon represented my hopefulness."

hahaha no Darkness in here... I've got a new meditation method that knocks me out for a good long while... as in like a full night. <33 Crystal. Thank you much baby <33

So I got to talk to her Sunday, last night, and possibly tonight. Bad news, I can't steal Dans phone tonight :[ That makes me sad but I'm kinda a bastard for doing it in the first place. Oh and I got to see Pat! Dude it was so cool since it's been so long. We're gonna hangout over turkey break.

So cuts are this thursday (rofl) Basicly if our name isn't on the schedual for next week we've been Cut (fired) which would be BULLSHIT if I got fired because I've busted my ass the past two weeks. I don't work again until thursday either. I hope I don't get fired because then I won't have money, and as is this paycheck is only going to be about 300$$ (Sorry Kristi, but I can't give you all of it, I need to eat you know. But you'll get 75% of it. Promise)

So I wonder now... if I do get fired how the fuck am I gonna get money... Well I've still got the cube to sell to Dan, which I can get like, 125 for since he's getting so much with it. And my mom shot down my computer selling idea... I was like WTFNooka! So that sucks. I hope I don't get fired...

Bwahaha, No work tomorrow though, gonna sleep in and then see if I can get 10 bucks from my grandpa so I can go pay off my library fee's *Glares at Kristi again* and get out a book on Alchemy, so I can learn some new ways to Fuxt with people. I will most UNDOUBTEDLY be getting on the internet while I'm there *I said I lost my card but I remember my number, and the card is in my wallet* So I can update again, though I might just read the book and post when I get to Dan's later.  Hrmmm I should start applying to different places again, though I'm worried about saying like, yeah I'm leaving for vacation mid december... So I guess I can just like, quit when that happens... haha. I need money :[

I should sell my body for sex... any takers? 5$ per go :] Haha I'm serious u.u;; If anyone is interested, leave a comment. Hmmm other ideas... I could sell my TV... That'd work I guess its a great tv works like a charm.... Yeah I might do that. It would stop me from play SNES all day since it wouldn't be next to my bed anymore. Hmm I should do that. *nod nod*

Anyone wanna buy a TV? pretty big, no remote though. Again comment!

Ok I think I'm out of sane things to say, that and I can't think straight cause I worked all day.  My feet hurt..."

"event","Seems like all this fighting in my journal has finally come to an end. Though... it could just be the calm before the storm. Either way, it doesn't matter much to me. So I start work tomorrow, and I can't wait. Also, so that I still have some money, I'm going to be selling my computer and my GameCube. I'm also selling my N64 today. But the money from that will be used today mostly. Everything else I'm going to put into my bank (honest this time) and saved until I have the 375 I need. I'm hoping to make that much, if not a little more, with the selling of the Computer and GameCube. The whole reason I'm doing this though... well thats a surprise. Only 1 other person knows (Well, person who reads this that is) and we aren't going to tell. It's not that we don't want to it is that we really can't. You see if we were to tell everyone the surprise, then it would most definitely get to the right person. And that is what we are trying to avoid. And here is my favorite thing, no matter what any of you think, I'm most certainly sure you are going to be incorrect. Though even if you get it right I won't tell you.
~Smiles~ Life is pretty good finally... now that I got word from Crystal. Though it does kinda suck being single again, its for a better cause. So hey, I'll live, I can't give up, I won't give up. Too much to do before I give up...
<center>Sorry soul but you've gotta stay around a little longer</center>
<marquee>Ahh, Life is good right now...</marquee>
So lemme get off the crystal thoughts for a moment (Oh My God he's really doing it?!) I am. I finally got around to finishing I,Robot last night, though I had to skip a few scenes it's ok because I saw them on HBO. Let me just say the end of that movie is FUCKING, AWESOME! I was on the edge of my seat and like, I couldn't believe it. I mean the trailers lead you to think some stuff, as does the movie, but OH MY GOD ARE YOU WRONG! Unless someone has told you the ending you will be amazed. After that I watched the making of it and it was so badass.
After I watched that I started to play Shining Tears, which I'm a little pissed at myself because I don't remember if I saved or not and If I did I fuxt up Cupido's skills. I was using him for fun and the skillz he has I definately placed wrong. Note to self: Shock = Max, Thunder ring up there as well as his auto skills at a good ratio. I placed some points in Rapid Fire, but the computer never used it, so I was thinking about it and decided to just put them in shock. I just hope to god I didn't save.
Then I went on to listen to The Postal Service while I tried to sleep, and I learned of a way to keep yourself awake. Make both of your hands into the thumbs up pose, and then push them together and hold it. It requires alot of mental determination to keep them pressed together for a long time, and that kept me awake. So after that I started to play Soul Blazer and fell asleep mad fast. I think I died too but I don't remember, haha. So either way, I had some kick ass dreams (I need to start manipulating them again before they start manifesting again) and woke up. Shaved everything off (sadness) and then got yelled at for not eating my cereal. So I came here to update and check some things out while I wait until 3 to goto the Concert today, then if I have the chance to cut my hair today I'm going to, but I might not. I'm also going bowling which might be fun, though Time Crisis 3 is about to get Pwnz'd to da M4xXx tonight.
Oh and I'm dressed in my temp halloween costume. I'm a ""Confused Goth/Prep"" and now for the hilarious story. ""Once upon a time, this lad was either a Goth, or a Prep. Now he is at that point in his life where he is confused, and he is converting. But the question still stands, is he becoming a goth... or a prep? Tune in next week to find out!"" Though its better if you hear me say it. I'll try and get a sound clip if I remember.
Well now... I've fun outta things to say... so for now I'm gonna browse the net before I go home to play Shining Tears/Lufia 2/Soul Blazer until I get picked up. Leave me love people."

"event","Hey Jimmy, 

I want you to know that even though I'm at college, I still think about you a lot. I really worry about you, and the choices you are making. I am not writing this to try and tell you what to do with your life -- because it's that: your life -- but I just want you to consider some things that I believe could really help your overall well-being. From reading your livejounal, it's not hard to see how unhappy you are. You have no commitments. No one depends on you for anything other than advice. And you feel stuck in this self-destructive cycle. And I agree with you that the patterns in your life are depressing. As your friend, take this piece of advice, and truly consider it. Do with it whatever you want, but please, please think about it. Your life needs structure. You talk all the time about big plans you have of travelling across the country. For your own sake, do it! Follow your heart, and you will find happiness. In your journal, you lay out provisions of getting there like selling your posessions, but what you need is a constant flow of money. A one way ticket to Washington is approximately $500. If you took a bus there, it would be about $250. food can cost anywhere from $7, to $20 per day, approximately. A place to stay is also something to think about, as is transportation once you arrive there. Where you stand now, you are financially trapped in Rochester. You need to get a job in order to advance your life. You complain that there is no way to get to places outside of walking distance, but RTS buses run every day. If you were to ask me, I honestly believe you are above low wage jobs. I have watched you play video games. You have an astounding attentiveness to detail, and a powerful memory. If you wanted it enough, you have the capacity to earn a college degree. Not everyone does, but you certainly have the capability. Again, with everything, money is the main obstacle. But there are literally thousands of no interest loans available that will put you through school, that don't require repayment until years after you are finished getting a degree. That's time enough to settle in to a well paying job that better fits your level of intelligence. I know this seems like a lot, but you are so capable of doing it. This, to me, seems like your only way out of a life of dissatisfaction. If you wanted, you can make these plans, and be enrolled in MCC for the Spring semester. MCC is a school specifically for people who know they want a college degree, but are uncertain about any specific feild. When settled in to MCC, taking an array of courses, you would have two years to decide what feild best suites your strengths. You have an array of friends already attending there. You could take courses with Jeff, Eddy, or Dan. And I'm sure they would help you coordinate transportation. And if a liberal arts school isn't for you, there is another option for you, and that is trade school. Trade school is a hands on way to develop skills to be a mechanic, plumber, electrician, cable guy, etc. There is an unbelievable demand for good workers in these fields, as more and more people get technical degrees. These careers allow for advancement as well. Once you develop your trade skills, and learn the ropes, you can open your own business, and make a lot of money. Trade school is not at all like High School. A lot of the work is shadowing a person of a specific trade, and learning from them. You have these options for you. You do not have to consider yourself a failure, because you do not have to give up yet. You are only 19 years old, and have your entire life ahead of you. You are physically healthy, and mentally strong. I believe in your potential, and am more than willing to help you achieve it. I care about you, and want to see you succeed, because I know you can. If you ever want to talk about anything with me, I'm here for you. 

Sincerely, 

Tim"

"event","So apparently I'm still a big fucking screw up in life. I've still got people mad at me from many months past, I keep fucking things up now, and I'm still depressed over something so STUPID that even I'm calling myself retarded now. So it's basicly like this. I have a girlfriend right now. I love my girlfriend. Yeah I said that stupid ass four letter word that only gets people in trouble. But here's the kicker, here's where I continue to be a fucking retard. I'm still fucking in love with crystal. I'm more in love with her than I've ever been with anyone else. And at this point, since I still have no idea whats going on with her, since I still haven't talked to her, I'm about... I can't say this far cause none of you can see that. I'm just really fucking close to selling my computer, my tv, my GameCube... pretty much everything that's mine that I don't need to survive, meaning my bed stays, just so I can get a fucking plane ticket right now and go out there. Just fly to seatle, walk, bike, hitchhike, whatever down to black diamond, and just search the town for her. Sleep on a bench somewhere, or not sleep at all for my duration there. And then, wether I meet her or not, return here to rochester and give up with life. Hell... I should just do that. Who would it really affect. No one, that's who. You'd all be better off without me. Hell everyone likes to stay away from me as is. And you know what... I wouldn't miss any of you... I'm sorry to say but I wouldn't. I mean I would probably miss my nephews, but I hardly see them as is. And Nick lives 5 fucking minutes from me. I'm a waste of air. A waste of space. Hell if I didn't have to prove something to myself... to everyone around me, if it wasn't for the fact that I'm still so fucking In LOVE with you Crystal... I would fucking off myself. Yeah you fucking heard me. You're the only fucking thing keeping me going and at this point I don't give a shit what you think about me anymore. I can't lie to my heart I can't stop loving you. Hell even if you're just toying with me, even if you didn't mean all that shit you said to me when I was dating Kristi, I still mean them. You're fucking stuck with me unless you off me yourself. Or once I meet you, if you reject me... no... when you reject me, thats when you'll be done with me. Because I'm not gonna continue letting my soul live when my one final shot at happiness lets me go. But don't get me wrong, like always I'm not saying this to guilt you or anything like that. Like I said before I'd much rather you come out and say it so I can get out of here. Really at this point... I don't fucking care anymore. Oh wait, I do... and it sucks. How am I doing this? Fuck it I'm just gonna buy some pot, roll myself a blunt, then buy a 12 pack of Bicardi Silver O3, Get fucked up and drunk.
I got drunk on my birthday, it was alot of fun. I wish I could get stoned to but the drinking was enough.
So yeah that's what I'm gonna do. In about a week, I'm gonna sell my computer, then my tv, and whatever else I can find to sell... the vcr's and whatnot, and then buy a plane ticket to go see Crystal, not even to see her, but to just, show up out of the blue. Call her grandpa and say, if you see her, tell her that her friend from new york, Jimmy, is going to be in seatle on this day, and then is going to come down to black diamond to meet her. Hang up with him, wait until I leave and go. Then when I get back I'll get on with my life. The only way this plan will fall through is if I start work like, the week after orientation. Then I'll have to work the 4 weeks before I can go. So either in early November, or Early December, I'm going to fly over to seatle and go see her, and finalize all these feelings... ALL THESE FUCKED UP THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD... just clear shit up. Then you'll get your money when I get back Kristi... and Everyone else, well... whatever. I don't give a shit anymore. You can all go fucking die for all I care. Hell I'll kill you if you want me to, just come to my house and tell me to... I'll stab you, if thats what you want."

"event","Heh... wow. Hey guys... who out there can <I>I</I> talk to when I have a problem. I mean no offense guys but I'm always helping you guys out and I never ask for help in return, but going back to the no offence part... none of you really can help. And it sucks...

So lets lay it out, anyone can answer, tell me what you think. I'll take a colab of responses and decide from there...


There's a guy (wow obiviously me) who is in love with one girl (Crystal) and having feelings for another (a friend who shall remain annon). Now the question isn't should I leave Crys for this girl... it's that, I really like this girl. She's like, well a sister to me, a really great friend, and a great person. I mean I hate causing her pain and I hate seeing her in pain but by being with her I'm causing her pain. I just, I'm having problems now. I don't even know what my own question is. Pretty much I know when both of them read this I'm going to be causing both of them pain. Crystal will think I love her less and my friend will think she's causing this and feel bad. But it's like this ok...

Here goes the feelings hurting part of life... the part I hate...

I still love Crys, as you could all tell by reading my journal. And, I'm not saying that I'm canceling my plans with her. Hell everything I do is still for her. I just, I can't be alone. I don't trust myself alone. Honestly, I know that being alone I'll hurt myself... Some of you saw that. Now I know this sounds bad, ""Hey _____ I'm with you because I can't be alone."" Thats not it. I'm with you because I like you, I get jealous over you, I don't get jealous over women that aren't worth it. *sighs* I'm losing it now, hah... I'm trying not to screw this up and I know I am. Look, I'm with you because I want to be, because you're fun to hang out with and because I enjoy spending time with you. But... You aren't attached to me. You can do what you want, you're a free bird. Never forget that. I hate bringing this up but... you knew this was temp. I just, I was trying to prevent you from falling for me. I'm sorry I failed... I honestly was trying not to be... as people say, the perfect guy... I don't know what to do anymore. I can stop... try to stop posting about Crystal, I can try to stop thinking about her constantly but it won't happen. I suppose thats my flaw, I'm too in love with her. And... *sighs again* I shouldn't even post this... I'm going to cause you more pain, I don't want to do that...

This is... we need to sit and talk about this... get everything out there, leave no stone unturned. We need to figure this out as perfect as we can... Figure EVERYTHING out... Because I told you, I care about you to much to hurt you.

And crystal... Remember what I said before. It still applies. If you don't remember read a few posts back, or e-mail me. You know them. I'll try and talk to you later...

Everyone else, comment as you see fit, say what you will, I can always ignore you. Remember that. Plus I won't pay any attention anyways because half of you wont even comment, and even less will read it. Hahaha... My life is sad..."

But don't call at night, because I live with my grandpa and the phone is in his room... don't ask me why. Hopefully I'll get one in my room soon enough, and if thats the case I'll have him turn off his ringer every night but until then, only daytime calls.

On a side note, I have to go see if my god damn wisdom teeth are ready to come out. As much as I want this done I'm mad scared cause I've no idea what happens. I hate pain. Other than that though life's been pretty shitty. I start work soon, which means I can finally pay Kristi back, which means I can Finally start saving up to go see, or possibly(hopefully) move out/visit Crystal.

I miss her. I still love her so much... It really sucks... not being able to talk to her. And I'm still thinking she doesn't love me anymore. Heh, I'm posting this like she wouldn't read it... but I don't know anymore. She never updates anymore and when it does, its bad news .... Oy I depress myself over her alot. Anyways I suppose tonight I'll finally get cracking on FFX... I figure its finally time to beat it.

Oh and Dan has Turrets when he plays video games... and parkinsins disease. But thats not important.

I'm starting to play piano, for fun. Learning Chrono Cross music.

Ya know I really should leave the information about my thoughts about Crystal for the end... I just lose desire to post after that...

Still missing you, still loving you, never letting the hopes and dreams die, always trying to put the plan in motion... Wanting to be beside you, making you the happiest woman in the world...

Crying in my sleep.... Everyday over you....

Loving you always."

Then dan came to get me and we got burger king. Then some like, 34 year old woman needed a ride to congress. I thought she meant the town hall, she meant the road in the city. like the entire way she was trying to hit on me, I was ignoring her, and I swear to god shes on drugs cause she kept talking to herself like woah.

Now I'm gonna be heading home soon to play more FFX and Blitzball, and sleep at some point before my fun filled day tomorrow.

"event","Libra (me) and Leo (Crystal)

When Leo and Libra join together in a love match, theirs is an agreeable union. Being situated two signs apart in the Zodiac, Leo and Libra experience a deep understanding of the inner-workings of the other. When the Lion's unbounded energy mixes with Libra's natural sense of harmony, this is a romance of great balance. Leo and Libra are both outlandish versus reserved, direct versus peace loving. They can enjoy a very smooth relationship because each can appreciate and benefit from the positive attributes of the other.

Libra calms and soothes Leo's flamboyance. As a couple, Leo and Libra are well balanced. Libra lays on the charm and good manners, which tame Leo's direct and acerbic personality. But Leo is far more decisive than Libra. Leo can help their partners to make decisions more easily and act on them, and they can teach the art of spontaneity.

Leo is ruled by The Sun and Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. The two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of relationships -- warmth and passion. The Sun and Venus go well together. The sun is a masculine energy and Venus a feminine, so this relationship strikes a balance between energies. Venus is about the beauty of romance, and The Sun is about invigorating life spreading warmth. This couple sustain one another for a long time."

"event","Alright so I have decided that I am going to attempt to keep this journal up to date on my exciting adventures abroad.  I am leaving tomorrow afternoon for Germany for 6 weeks on a study abroad trip.  As of right now I am mostly packed (I think) except for a couple of very important things such as computer, iPod and phone.

I will be living in an apartment with up to 5 other people and I have no idea as to their genders or where they will be from, but I do know that they will all be about my age.  I am not counting on having internet in my apartment but I know it is available on campus and as I have no classes on Wednesday that will most likely be my day to update, however I may type up some things during the week and just post multiple times.

Well thats it for now.  I need to be off and get ready for bed as we are heading up to the airport earlish in the morning, meaning before 10."

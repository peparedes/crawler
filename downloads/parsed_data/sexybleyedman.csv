"event","AS YOU CAN SEE FROM MY BUDDY ICON, I AM CLEARLY A VERY SEXY BLUE EYED MAN.  SO WHERE'S THE LIE?  oh...right....I AM NOT A BULLS FAN!  i just happen to love the hat.  it's my man hat.  Got a problem with that?

Now, Originally my man hat was a Dolphins hat.  But I lost that first beloved hat a year and a half ago......tears.  tears.

Then, a bitch who shall rename nameless, but let's just say Lauren knows her as having a name that rhymes with ""billi-an"" or ""lillian"", helped me find another Dolphins hat.  It was ugly, not as attractive on me, and I tried to make it my own...but that just didn't work for me.  tears.  I miss the original.

Then, I found this Bulls hat.  The only decent hat left on my hat rack.  I have had this hat for six months...it is my man hat.  I love it....I wear it everywhere in New York.

Kate, however, hates it, and says it makes me look like a 12 year old boy.  She hates it so much that one time she jumped on top of it and stamped on it in the streets of New York, and another time when she was throwing up from drinking too much, she almost puked on it purposely, EVEN THOUGH the hat was holding her hair back.

I have since washed the hat, mind you, but I still love it with a passion; HOWEVER, NINA'S hat has made me newly jealous.

LOOK AT IT! IT IS THE PERFECT DOLPHINS HAT!  Now, granted, it is nothing like my original hat....it even has a different color; HOWEVER, IT IS JUST AS GOOD, IF NOT BETTER, AND I LOVE IT!

Therefore...I propose...that me and nina get the same hat.  MATCHING HATS!  As I am the bigger dolphins fan of the two of us, since Nina is dually alined between the Redskins and the Dolphins (I don't care how the Skins do, though of course, being from D.C./VA I will support them if I don't know who they're playing so long as its not the DOLPHINS)....I am solely a Dolphins fan.  EVEN AFTER DAN MARINO MIND YOU!!!!  Let me remind you people of Ricky Williams, Jason Taylor, Orandie Gadson, etc. etc. etc.  Fuck Steve Spurrier, Ricky Williams is an ANIMAL baby.

Also, in case anyone is curious, me and Nina are now dating, but only over Christmas break when we are in the same area.  If we are long distance, there is no relationship.  Also, I get no hat if we are long distance.  mmm...Christmas...here I come.

Anyhow, that's my hat comments from New York.  I miss D.C. ...wanna go back...love it best.  Even though this city's great.  A kiss to my Italian seasonal girlfriend.....and a hug to Lauren.  And anyone else nosy enough to read this shit and care, I hope you liked learning about me and my history of hats."

"event","OK!  Let's get ONE THING STRAIGHT!  I DID NOT WRITE THAT APOLOGY LETTER!  NEITHER DID LAUREN!  NINA IS A PROFILE ABDUCTING, COLD BLOODED, ITALIAN PROFILE ABDUCTOR! (and if I knew how to change my password I'd be able to stop her, but alas I am in the Generally Stupid Program at New York University and can't quite seem to figure this technology mumbo jumbo out).
P.S. Lauren is amazing .....oh, does anyone know how to get it so every time someone posts a message, it doesn't get automatically emailed to me?????  NINA!  I NEED YOUR HELP!
P.P.S. There is  JMU Dukedog homosexual meeting alert on Lauren's livejournal...Lauren, that doesn't mean you've become a lesbian and joined Gay Dukedogs does it???   OH!!!!!! And BY THE WAY! Anyone notice the picture for the JMU gay dukedog thing?  IT'S JOHN ALEX!!!! The kid from O'Connell plays!!! who used to wear the bright yellow shirt in West Side Story, with longer hair, etc!   That was so weird, seeing his picture there!!!!!!!

I swear to God, Lauren, if JMU has made you into a lesbian........
MY EXGIRLFRIEND IS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO BE A LESBIAN! (er, bisexual, if we must be technical). 

Well, ok, i think i've managed to simaltaneously offend and send love to both of you......

p.p.s. how the hell is it possible that both sarah AND julia (presumably sullivan) have read my livejournal???  I HATE LIVEJOURNAL, I DONT EVEN WANT TO UPDATE IT, I just use it to post random comments and pry into you (lauren) and nina's lives!!!!

p.p.p.s.  YANKEES SUCK!!!! GO DOLPHINS!!! GO METS!!! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!!!!!!

"event","Dear Nina, 

I am sorry I yelled at you in my last post. That wasn't such a nice thing to do. I take it all back. I like the Dophins and the Redskins, and the Yankees are amazing. I hope that I didn't upset you.

All my love,

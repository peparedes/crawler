"event","Yes, call me a simple man, but I tend to find the most pleasure in the simplest things. I am referring specifically the furniture that I just got in my room. As I had been living here for almost four weeks now (and majority of that time with only my single mattress on the floor, and a clothes rack), it had definitely been getting to me. I mean, I would try to clean my room, so I would walk around gathering up all the crap off the floor, and then turn around and put it back on the floor. Call me defeat-us but i just found it such an unforfilling and less-then-productive experience. But today, the parents came down bearing a desk, a chest of draws and other things that I definttely missed. So yey... surfaces.

I feel so ""sex in the city"". I am sitting here tapping away on a laptop about the most pointless things in my life - however unlike Sarah Jessica Parker, I am not wearing bra and panties. Thank god I hear you all say. 

Well I would have to say that last night was alot of fun. True, as I had not been really out in a whole 2 weeks, I would have been happy dancing in someones kitchen, but last night was very cool. The night starting with a health does of predrinking at home, then heading out to meet Chris and Co. at Town Hall. After making other various stops, we ended up at the night club TANK, which I could not stop thinking looked exactly like the basement from the final scene of Silence Of The Lambs. *Luke looks nervously behind him for a psycho with a task for cutting flesh*. The, surprise surprise, Chris and I found ourselves on Oxford St. where we found Nick and ended up in a house party which was really cool. A very nice place and I got to meet Gav which I had been wanting to do for probably more then a year now. I havent check to see how bad it is, but I know that in my quasi-drunken state I found a computer and wrote in this journal... great. 

Some of us decided to head down the Midnight Shift and I am sure the general older population did not mind. Beau managed to get there, despite all odds, (which is a good thing though!) and I was sprung with the task of making myself 'straight' infront of his cousin. A tad hard to do when you wander out of the Midnight Shift humming Kylie. Still, it was funny.

I really have to stop ranting on this. I doubt anyone reads it anyway!

"event","Hey there Y'all,

Well as the subject may suggest, I am quite drunk and quite happy. At the moment I am aat a really nice place on oxford street that belogns to a guy named Chris and a friend of mine i have chatted for yonks, Gav. Twas good to finally put a face to the name. 

They are playing 80's music. Some of which is actually 0K. Chris says Hi!

ANd now we are all joining in, in a few Alidin tunes.

For god sake, what am I doing, I should be party-ing.

Well jess, back to it,

Later.

(Hey - me again. I went into ""edit"" in my now sober state to go make this entry make sence, but realised, fuck it, I was drunk and its not meant to make sence. The funniest thing is what they hell would I put ""well jess"" instead of ""well yes""... what was on my mind!?!?)"

"event","I didnt realise that this LJ thing would mean maintanence... keep forgetting I have it. Wonder if its like all those pets you get that you mother warns you about. You will just love it while its new and then it will die. hmmm...

Fact. Customers with the worst breath are always the ones that want to get into your personal bubble.

Work was brilliant.

Yesterday was a combination of goods and bads. As I have exam at the moment I made my self study - a bit - and Beau came over to help me study. It, somehow, actually worked, but I would have to say that more enjoyable moments included lying in bed watching timeless episodes of futurama. Nothing brings two people closer. 

So yeah, had my first two exams today. Sociology and Psychology. I will be happy to pass. Then had a beer and a game of pool with a friend to celebrate finishing them. Came home, spent the better part of an hour removing apple juice from my keyboard (good as new now, yey) then continued to do little the rest of the night. The first time in a long time and I admit - i loved it!

My teeth hurt... why...

This is a very 'structured' and quite impersonal entry aye... but what can you do.

Its time for me to crawl into that huge bed of mine, all by my lonesome, as I am working tomorrow morning. Queen size beds are cool, but I cant help feeling somewhat stupid in it by myself.

*hug*

Night night"

"event","So, yesterday not alot happened that would be worth reporting. It was the true beginning of my studying for my looming examinations. I think that I did pretty well considering how little I usually manage to get done. I can see a few more days like this ahead in the near future...

But today... well that was much better. The plan was, to wake up early and either study or go the gym. Neither happened. Instead I got up with enough time to get ready for the train down to Cronulla where I would be meeting Beau and his friend Paul and we would be ""doing lunch"". Just saying that makes me feel so ""city boy"". To fill you all in, it is my understanding that Paul is staff member at the University of Wollongong (Beau's Uni) and that the two became friends partly from that, and partly becuase they used to live close to each other - across the road infact.

Paul was driving and took us to a really nice place introduced to me as Bronte. Kinda looked like a nicer version of Terrigal, in a smaller spot. We stopped for lunch at a resturant/cafe where I am certain I had some of the best tasting and most healthy food I have eated in a while now. I had a sea-food mix, and despite my original concerns that I would find some eight legged apertisers on my plate, it did not happen. We also had a bottle of wine with lunch, something that I can not say that I am used to, and partly because Paul was driving and could not indulge, and partly because my tollerance to wine is pathetic, I got quite a bit tipsy. I think I managed to maintain class...errr... We then continued through to Newtown where some belt shopping started our shop hoping, but buying leather jackets concluded it all. Go Paul! Then we did coffee and cake and I would have to say it was the best coffee I had had in a very long time. I had a top time with good food and great company/conversation.

A bit of a....weird.... way to finish the day was when they dropped me off at my place and I didnt even get to hug Beau goodbye. It really sucked but I realise that you cant have your cake and eat it too, atleast always. I know Beau felt the same way though. It could definatly be a metaphoircal definition of ""so close yet so far away"".
Tommorow is another study day to be broken with my friend Ashleigh comming for lunch. Probably gonna get pasta at this cool place called Mamma's Kitchen. Cheap and tastey. 

Thats it for now Y'all

Over and Out."

"event","Well here I am. It has been a long time in the coming, but Luke is back in the loop, and also with this nifty journal thing. First of all, I would like to apologise for those of you that read my entries and have to choke over my spelling. I was simply born without the chromosones that give one that ability to be grammatically able - it would seem. I am however pleased to find a spell check option at the bottom of this page. A big thank you to my Beau (works on two levels) for the invite to this little website, and for whoever shared it with him, Chris I would imagine. 

Now that I have set the scene and dealt with the pleasantries, lets here about me. 
Well I now live in the city and to be honest, I dont exactly know how to say I am doing down here. When my parents ask me how I am doing, I think I answer ""i feel indifferent"". I dont find myself missing home at any length, which is good, but I cant say that I feel I have found my groove here. I think that a large part of the reason for this would be that I have had a massive increase in stimulus since moving. It could also be that in the past I have been a pretty structured person, and now everything is so disorganised. Very full on - but I can certainly see myself getting use to it. I will say that on the whole, I am happy and can only see myself getting happier. 

I had been thinking about how I could approach this topic on live journal for a long time now because a) i am not sure how to put into words how I feel, and b) what Beau says is so damn sweet I just can't compete! so ill just have to do my best and keep it simple. Even with all this moving and settling in my life, it has not been the biggest thing to happen to me in this past month. That trophy would belong to someone who came into my life at the same time I was moving down. A boy that went from a name thrown around in one of my common conversations with chris, to a guy who was coming out clubbing with us, my friend, and now my boyfriend, Beau. I have never been with anyone that has made me feel the way Beau does and I make sure that I dont take it for granted. Right back at you Beau, the beginning of something beautiful. Cant wait to see you again 

Well as much as I would like to rant on about other stuff, the flatmates need the phone line too. 

Until next time, 

Later!"

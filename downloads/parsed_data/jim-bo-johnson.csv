"event","Haven't wrote in a while so I guess it's time. I started writing poems once more the storm kinda forced it out of me in a way. I hate not having a dog becuz when i have no power my entertainment is a braindead parakeet and my mind (scratch the second one). well I might as well write it and nobody make fun of my brainless writing my sanity was completely gone by this time and it was written about a tornado that hit my neighborhood.

I sit here listening
hearing the sounds of a beast 
ripping apart all that is my home
now I can see into the eyes of the beast
destruction in front me 
my home behind me
i am now presented with a choice
stay and die with my home
or run away and watch my home fall to the power of this  beast
i chose to stay
i'm lucky i lived 
if it weren't for a tree that has screwed me over many times
i would lay in a casket burried in the ground
to this tree i say thank you 
to this monster i say 
""Go big or don't go at all""

"event","Man this is a confusing life we live. Everyone surprises you when you least expect it. Im trying to get this whining pahse over with as fast as possible. Im giving myself a frikin headache. I mean I lie on my bed at night thinking about so much. Then I have a girl I never went out with getting mad at me cuz she basically cries herslf to sleep. I did nothing to her. This story all happened at camp and I really wish none of it would have ever happened.

I'll start from the beginning. On the bus ride up there she would eat ONE chip and call that a frikin meal. And for some reason I kept trying to get her to eat more than that (never have a cold dunkin' donuts donut). She started getting me to the point where I wanted to blow my brains out ! But anyways she did alot of slutty things that I really regret taking part in. When we got up to the camp I think it was either second or third day I went and talked to courtney and monica in the girls dorms lobby and then she acts like just cuz I was talking to girls besides her I was cheating WE WEREN'T EVEN GOING OUT !!!!!!!!!!! Then she has the nerve to call my room and tyler and stuart pick up the phone pretending to be me (which was so funny). In their conversation she kept acting like she never got mad at me and all this crap. Then we finally hung up on her then I ran around in my plaid blankie for awhile talking with some people from other states and stuff it was kinda cool. Then I go back into the room and lay down with a massive headache and she keeps caling the room so I unplugged the phone nd slept for awhile. The next day at lunch she was staring at me the whole time so I had Emu sit where she couldn't see me and she kept moving to look at me. Then at lunch she makes me talk to her so I make up lies to get her off my case and she tries to follow me to the dorms so I had her brother get her off my back while I escaped (sounds like alcatraz doesn't it ?). Then on the bus ride home she didn't talk to me (thank God !). Now every frikin Wed. that I go to church I'm reminded about what happened by somebody. Cna't they just get a clue I dont want to remember ! If I could give up everything just to go back and keep that from happening I would do it in a heartbeat.

I was told by a friend that I needed to get everything thats bothering me off my chest. So if you feel like this was a total waste of your time then BITE ME ! Now on a leaving note I give you this...

Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold 

And I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now i can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold 

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me theres just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold"

Every time that I bleed it's my affection
Every time that I come clean it's my humiliation
And everything that I say, I say to save myself
Everything that I say makes 
My world come crashing down
Every time you're near me
I feel I'm crashing down
Every time that I breathe it's to keep you alive
Every time that I see it's to watch you say goodbye
No more words inside my head
To save my ass this time
No more words inside my head
When it all comes crashing down
Every time you're near me
I feel I am crashing down
I feel I am crashing
Every time I breathe I breathe for you
And every time I move I move for you
And ever time I see I see for you
And everything I do has been for you
Every time I breathe I breathe for you
And every time I see I see for you
And everything I do I do for you
And everything I do makes it
All come down
Everytime you're near me
I feel I'm crashing down

"event","ever since i lft for NC 've been getting alot of things that have troubled me for so long off my chest..but then i get slammed with about 10 million more. this is really starting to take me down piece by piece. if i keep getting hit like this i'll finally break. and the people who've always hated my attitude... thinking i dont care, guess what I DO ! i just dont how it like all the others on this planet... im different then the rest of you... i guess im a freak or something, but oh well freaks are awesome




Inspiring, shining, rising
And when you're in my way
I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together
Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather
The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure
Is me manifested as you in this endeavor
Once responsibility is taken I can render 
Experience to be however I want to remember

Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios
Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the aroogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles
Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what wou're trying to find

Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light

There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to life
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences you missed
So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find"

"event","The past few days have been completely messed up. I guess I should start from the beginnig and i'll try not to screw things up.it all started Sunday night. I stayed on the phone with this chick named Heather till 12:30 in the morning. I decided to just stay up and play GTA 3 since I had to get up at 4:00 to go to the hospital. I took Heather's hackie sack with me so I wouldn't blow my brains out from boredom. They have this Chapel there so since nobody was in there I went in and played hackie sack with meh self (i kept hitting crap). Anyway they have a camera in there so that you can watch it on the TVs in the rooms (i found that out the hard way). when i walked back to me mums room i found out they were watching me the whole frikin time.
Skip Ahead several hours......
When I got home to my granny's house I called Heather to tell her how everything went. Her bro answered then said he'd tell her. So I layed down then my Granny came in with the phone saying it was Heather's dad. he got real pissed at me when he asked my age and I told him. He was thikning I was alot older then I really am and he was pissed cuz he thought i was 2 years older then Heather becuz she's 12. We only have year difference in age cuz she turns 13 soon. 
Today
I stayed in the Hospital almost all day. Me mum gets to go home tomorrow. So its all good (damn you Racheal you got it stuck in my head). I wold write more, but I am tired so I'll stop there.

"event","Today sucks. It has felt like some old crapppy rock song. I wake up to find I'm in my frikin boxers and my house is full of relatives. I'm laying there passed out from Firehouse last night and there is a bunch of old people in my house. Not what I call a good thing to wake up to. Then I find out that my stupid step dad used his credit card to make an advance on his parents' buisness for frikin $ 10,000 without telling anyone about a month ago. All I know is if I end up on the streets and don't have any food. He dies first.
Anyway I have several bleach burns now thanks to cleaning. I hate cleaning. Cleaning is for people that care about what other people think of them. I just want this day to end.
Anybody else that feels my pain go ahead and tell us about one of your sucky days.

"event","Haven't written here in a while. I wouldn't today, but Sam is forcing me. I have no clue what to write except I'm leaving for camp soon. 10 hours on a tour bus hopefully have my own seat. I hate having to share a seat. I won't care if its one of the secret society members. Last year me and jeff were sent on a mission to scare everybody while it was stil dark. We had to crawl under blankets without being noticed and grab peoples legs to freak them out. It was a success. The 10 caused temporary insanity on my part and some stayed permanently. I'm gonna be witing memories of camp every other day till I leave.

First I wake up to a fan squeaking itself into orbit(sounds fun). Then I ate some raisin bran. Took a shower. Sketched a picture of my room. And I had to turn in a poem to my teacher. And here it is...if you know me you'll know who this is about.

Her smiling face,
the way she laughs,
they are just a few things that bring me back to her,

Though I might have done some stupid things,
she always lets me come back,
Alone at night I cry,
I cry about what I have done to her,

Alot of things I wish I could take back,
but I can't take it back,
I have crossed the line and I can't take it back

the rest ain't gonna be posted cuz I ain't got time"

"event","god- first entry in like a year- fuck me. its my b-day but it doesnt feel like it. i wish i were younger and awake right now out of anticipation instead of insomnia. its been my bday 4 a couple of hours and i already got 3 text messages and 4 fone calls one of which included singing which was sexy. its weird but some of the most lonely times ive had has been in a sea of friends who all love me-random thought i know but its been a recurring one so i thought i would share. most days start off good and twards the middle are a blast but at the end i feel crappy, like i spent the whole day shopping looking at pretty things but didnt buy anything. after all the happiness spent i have nothing left to hold on to. but its ok i guess cause more good times will be there tomorrow. I got a hello kitty cake lame i know but it make me happy so whatever i think jessi and i are having are party this month anyone i like is invited, so yea thats alot of ppl. As far as gossip goes yea i definatly have a crush, its just really awkward circumstances. the whole thing is out of an episode of sex and the city, ashley u know the one. i talked to him again 2day! I wonder how long i need to like this guy 4 me to fall in love with him and then immediatly hate and resent him cause that is my M O. This entry is bitter sweet and really unstructured so im gonna end with a big fuckin HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my girl JESSI!!!!"

"event","the sex assembaly was scary i have never heard any one scream HPV that loud in my life. but it didnt make me think any differently. my beliefs are who i am and if i take on someone elses (aka catholics, mrs. reyes, or whoever) than ill loose myself and i would rather loose my hymen than my identity. but according to the internet war it looks like ashley and moosh are gonna loose it to dixon any day now. steven came home today and we went out to lunch it was so good to see him, i mean what no it wasnt. steph called me stoned out of her mind from baskin robins to wish me a happy 4-20, lets see shwat the fuck else happend 2day... i went to pat and oscars 4 dinner with blair and grabbed chrissys ass 4 the hundreth time... im such a fuckin rascal, i dont know what else to say... um hagen's 1st day of work is today so good luck to him... and i got 2 necklaces from steven and a clip thing... blair is tottaly betrothed to the guy in the black shirt only not really cause i would be stuck with the one in the blue... and lets see... oh passover on saturday with laura and jamie and john whos back from the marines and promised me that he would bench press eric (not like thats my fantasy or anything) my lifes kinda boring right now we need to have that sleep over at chrissys house and get all the boys wasted!"

here ill show u
                                      chrissy neen

"event","so anyway ive been keeping pretty busy thus far, hanging out with augura and westlake ppl and ppl from my church (scraping the bottom of the friendship barrel)
the reason im not hanging out with ppl from lareina is that a) their all on bacation and second of all some ppl are ignoring me. i wont say who... or will i... ok ill do it... no i musnt. anyway im over it. im in town in case anyones is wondering. chrissy is back from nueva york so maybe she will call me, and lauren and i r official secound best friends now so we r hanging out alot more, which is good even tho she is baby sitting. OMG i hung out with brynn jornacion this whole weekend which was so fun we got to catch up alot and surprisingly she knew alot more gossip than i did! anyway she is comming back in december so the chrismica party is an absolute must. so here are some things i need to do this summer...
-have a party with ashleys hot cousins and make woopie with the younger one
-go to the beach at least 11 times b4 school starts
-go to third street and santa monica/barbara
-must go to city walk with lauren and who ever else
-go to madres
-try morracan food with friends (sitting on couches+eating food with hands= fun)
-plan b-day
-hang out
-most important hang out with all my friends and get wasted and smoke and hit on guys like we used to because i miss that the most who's with me?!?

PS tommorro tuesday im at the rapist till 5 be home at seven can hang out after that"

Ewww omg so was miguel that bitch, but we ignored eachother 4 the whole afternoon so it was cool i guess. then i went 2 one of my fave resturaunts the palm. it was in boys town which is the gay village of california and to top off that gay night i saw mama mia! how lame am i! it was actually pretty good tho and i had a good time. apparently there is a party being thrown at that mike guys house and since kelsy and i dont hate him no i guess the whole crews going except kelsey cause shes going 3 fucking alaska in the fucking summer .

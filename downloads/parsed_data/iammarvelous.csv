So i was laying down and i soon fell asleep...then i woke up this morning at 7 with a killer headache and my ear waz burning and waz all hot becuz i waz sleeping on it. Then i woke up at 11 and my headache waz worse so i told michelle and she told me i should eat sumthing and then take Ibuprophen. So she made me toast with jam and i only ate a lil corner of it and then i didnt want to eat nemore becuz i didnt want to throw up. But she assured me i wouldnt..so i took 2 ibuprophens and slowly finished my toast then i layed down until my headache went away. I felt MUCH better. I waz so excited becuz we were gonna go out on the boat!!!!!!!! Ahhh it waz sooo much fun! I had a blast. Now im just sitting here with no plans for tonight and nuthing to do...sad.

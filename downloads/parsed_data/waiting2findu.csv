"event","<p>So over the last two days, I've had long&nbsp;conversations with my mother, which incase you guys don't know, we don't talk that much and don't get along really either. </p><p>Talk number one came last night while I was eating dinner after work. We were talking about the fact that my mom's been unemployed since my birthday (Oct. 26, 2006) and how she might take a job in Kentucky. The only problem is she would leave me and my sister's here in our house and she would come home every weekend. The job is about 600 miles round trip from my house and she would pay the bills and stuff, but there's the chance that it wouldn't work out completely and she wouldn't be able to come home every weekend. It would just be me and my two sisters home alone and fending for ourselves everyday. I know that we could do it but it worries me. I know that I want to leave home and stuff but to be honest, I'm not ready for things to happen. I'm just afraid if she doesn't find something then she won't be able to. In case you guys didn't know, money has been very tight over the last few years and we've been struggling so I want her to take the job but I'm not ready to be alone and I don't know what to do or think about the whole situation. I'm scared that I'll lose her completely and I know we hardly talk and fight a lot but that doesn't mean I don't want to see her and have her here for not only me but also the cats and dogs and sisters. Why does life do this to me all the fucking time ?</p><p>Talk number two consisted today and considered my dog Buddy. We tell people he's about nine years old but we think he's older than that. I've had him for just about seven years and he's my baby and he always gives me that look and licks my face when I'm in a bad mood and sits in my room just so I don't have to be alone. It all started&nbsp;a few days ago when he was yelping in pain and couldn't get up or wag his tail or do anything. He wouldn't bend down to pick anything up and at first I thought he was dying but then we think its just his arthritis acting up. We got some pills for him and over the last three days he's been getting doing a little bit better but you never know. Last night he attacked Lucy, my sister's dog, for no reason and made her bleed and then today he bit my sister and caused a lot of swelling and bruising and she even bled a little bit. We can't figure out why he's been doing this but I think there's something else going on with him that we just don't know about. My mom and I were talking today and she said if this keeps up with him that we'll have to put him to sleep because of his temper. I don't want to lose him but I might not have a choice. I know that all living things die eventually but I'm not ready to say goodbye. I might not have a choice though.</p><p>I hate life this week :/</p>"

Last week on January 5, 2007, while I was driving home from work, my car started on fire. It was the worst night of my life because not only was it after 10 pm but I'm on I-696 where everyone can see me. I was all alone and by the time the fire truck got there it had probably been in flames for about fifteen minutes. I don't know what's worse than watching the whole front end of your car fall apart in front of your eyes. I cried all night long and just spent the weekend alone mopeing around and being sad. I'm without any money and without a car so I have no idea what I'm going to do. Another stupid thing thrown at me with no solutions to any problems. I guess this week I'm glad my hours aren't crazy a lot at work so I can have a few days off to relax and not have to think about it. Blah ...

Craig and I broke up yesterday and it was nothing that he did. This was just something that I felt like I needed to do. I'm not going to explain anymore or write anymore about it, but there might be something on my MySpace later in a friend's only blog about stuff. I do just want to make this clear since I seem to be lying about it all of the time. I didn't break up with him for another guy, there's no one else.

I don't really have anything else to write about but I do want to say thank you to Chanel for being there for me when I needed a friend the most. Seriously without you I don't know what I would do. I also want to say that Jason is the coolest for letting me laugh in his face about nothing. I love my friends hxc &lt;3"

"event","<p>So it still seems impossible for me to get a full solid night's sleep. It never fails that I wake up a few times during the night and sometimes its only for a few minutes and other times its for at least an hour, sometimes more. If things could go back to normal then I would be a happy camper but I don't know if they ever will. I've been having a lot of crazed dreams lately and usually I only remember parts or objects in them, but sometimes they scare me. Its getting to the point where sometimes sleeping alone frightens me, but oh well, there's nothing this girl can do.<br /><br />So much has been going on in my life lately and I don't know what to make of any of it. I've been doing a lot of thinking, I know what a shocker to you all that know me, but its been bringing me down. I know what needs to be said and done, but I just can't bring myself to do it yet. Blah blah blah ... you just think I'm rambling because I won't put what about because I know a few certain people read this and its mostly about these two people. My best friend knows and she won't tell either so boo yah. Stupid life and stupid gazillion thoughts running through my precious little head.<br /><br />I've been very insecure lately :/ I'm back to thinking I'm useless and fat and ugly. Why I get like this I'm not really sure? No its not because Mary Kate Olsen is back to 80 lbs or because Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are stickly thin because I think they're ugly. It has nothing to do with the media or the famous people but more with me and the things that I've been through or that have been said to me or about me. Its just a personal thing and I'm trying to overcome it but so far not so good. Blah, don't comment about it because what you say probably won't matter anyway :/ </p><p>I guess I don't really have anything to say but I really do need to start writing more. Maybe not in here because a lot of stuff is personal and I think sometimes way to many people read this and I'm not ready to get myself into trouble, at least not yet. I'll try to write more though for anyone that cares to read at least one entry. Have a good day!</p>"

"event","<p>Tomorrow morning marks the start of another New Year where I will most likely upset everyone and become an even bigger fuck up than I already am. I've come to the conclusion that no matter how hard I try I end up pissing people off. Why do my feelings get pushed aside? Why do I always have to be the one to please everyone? God, I'm only one fucking person and I can't do everything, but people seem to think that I can.<br /><br />I'm very upset right now, but because I know certain people read this, I'm not going to say much about why. Its not worth starting up more shit between us again, but I just want you to know that I didn't fucking lie and I didn't do any shit before. If you don't believe me than that's fine, but I'm telling the truth.<br /><br />Uuu ggg hhh ... ... ... I'm back to feeling really insecure about the way that I look again and its not getting good. I had a few things to munch on last night, but it wasn't anything. My migranes are getting worse and I feel like I'm being stabbed in the head. I hate when I get like this because this is the time when I lose weight and try to be that ""PERFECT"" girl. No matter how hard I try to tell myself that I'm fine with the way that I look, for some reason, I cannot believe it. I weigh roughly 110 lbs. and haven't eaten a real meal since yesterday morning at like 10 am and to be honest, I only ate half of it. I try to eat, but sometimes food makes me sick and from not eating, I can't eat a lot before I get full. FUCK, I hate being like this but I can't change it just yet.<br /><br />Well I don't have anything else to say because frankly I don't even think that I should write in here anymore. Work sucks to the max and school is stupid for right now. Maybe the New Year will bring something amazing my way and maybe for once I'll truly be happy ...</p><p>Happy Fucking New Year</p>"

"event","So I never write in here anymore and I'm not a hundred percent sure why. I got over the fact that no one reads this and that no one truly cares other than a few people in my life. I bought another real journal and have been writing in that when I get down so that I don't have to share my secrets with the world. Everytime I say that I'm going to write I don't and a part of me thinks its because no one will listen or some will think that I'm screaming out for help, when in all actuality I'm not.

Christmas starts in about twenty six hours and I'm not going to lie, I'm not looking forward to it. Every year I put on the happy face and spend time with my family and pretend like everything is ok, but I'm screaming for help in my own secret way. However, no one ever comes and helps. I try to fight the tears and I can't hold them back for one day. This year marks the fifth Christmas without my brother and I try to act like I'm fine and that everything is ok but its not. I wonder if I'll ever be ok and if the pain will ever completely go away. What scares me the most is that I'll lose all my memories of him and I don't want that at all. I wish he was here to crack jokes and be my older brother, but he's not and from September to December of every year I have the worst time. No I'm not crying out for help and I don't want your sympathy, I just want a friend that cares.

I want to go back to the days where I was the happiest girl alive and if people didn't like me then I didn't fucking care. The days where my ""friends"" were actually around and people don't play fucking games. When boys didn't matter and track was my life. The time where I was happy about the way that I looked and learned to accept the fact that I would never fit in with the pretty and popular girls in school. Where life was simple and I didn't have to struggle to pay my bills and work didn't take over my life. When I felt pain but never inflicted it. When I had more than one or two people I could talk too. When everyone didn't lie to me and people didn't forget my birthday. The time where my family was all around before the fights. Where holidays consisted of more than my family and one aunt. Where I would spend hours outside playing in the snow [which hasn't come yet this year] and taking random pictures with my friends. Where school didn't take up my life and failing classes didn't happen. The good ole days when I was happy.

Blah ... I think Steve is right :/ and it angers me knowing that he's probably right and I'll never be the same. Blah ... I'm going to read and escape to the camp ..."

"event","Today marks year number five since my brother's been dead. I always tell myself that things will get easier but they never do. It seems that as the older I get the more I need him in my life to guide me and give me advice about things that I can't talk to certain people about. I wish that he was hearing watching me grow and helping me rather than looking down on me and shaking his head. I wish I wasn't such a disappointment.<br /><br />I go to church once a year for the anniversary of his death and this year we went this past Sunday. It seemed like a shorter service but it wasn't. They announced his name like they do every year and for once I didn't cry. I wanted to so bad but I felt like I couldn't. I cry a lot now and I cried last night and this morning about everything. I cry for a few seconds and then I'm ok but it seems like there aren't any tears left for me to cry.<br /><br />I wanted my brother to be proud of me but I know that he isn't. I know that if he was still alive I wouldn't cut myself nor think about killing myself [the feelings are getting better] and I know that I would be able to sleep at night without waking four or five times every night. I know that I wouldn't take aspirin to make my problems disappear and I know that I wouldn't cry as much as I have. I know that I wouldn't have done a lot of things because he wouldn't have allowed me to make such stupid decisions in my past. I wanted to be his kid sister forever and now he's just another one to add to the death count number.<br /><br />Everyday I wish about being able to change the past. I wish I could invite a time machine just to spend one last day with him and tell him exactly how I feel. I wish that I could have changed things and made him see things differently. I wish I could talk to him rather than just look and feel stupid talking to myself because no one ever answers. I wish that&nbsp; he would help guide me and tell me that everything would be ok. I wish that I didn't have to be like this but its been three years since it all started and I doubt it will ever change.<br /><br />I hate life today :/&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font size=""7"">RIP Jim<br />9/1/77 - 12/5/01</font></strong>"

That makes another one that I ended and put back in the drawer with all the other ones. Maybe next summer I can finally burn them all and end the past and start over completely fresh.

I didn't do the stuff for my English class yet, but Chanel helped me out with some things last night while she was working. I'm pretty stoaked how I got things worked out or would at least like to think that.&nbsp; Thinking about taking a semester off to save money and pay off some bills because I'm thinking about leaving WSU anyway so we'll see. 

My mom's had a couple job interviews lately which is a good thing. She's pretty excited and so am I, however, I would have liked to move to Cleveland and start over, but it happens. Its pretty cool though that I don't have to move and I can stay home. Thinking about picking up another job for December and January because I'm not making enough and my bills are way too much. It sucks how I have to come up with more money. Fuck Christmas this year along with a few other things.&nbsp;

I wish that I had the motivation to write in here and I wish that I could smile twenty four seven but I can't. I sit at home in my room and I reminisce about my past, which I shouldn't] and my future, which I don't like to think about. I wonder why I'm sitting here thinking terrible thoughts and wondering if I'll ever be ok again. I have my great days but I also have my terrible days. Everything seems to be falling apart and I don't know how to fix it nor if I even can.<br /><br />I haven't been sleeping at all and I think its because my stress level is beyond high. I'm lucky if I get four hours a night now and you would think that I'd get hit with wanting to sleep in the middle of the afternoon but I don't. I lay awake at night and think and when I try to clear my mind, it never really works. I stopped writing all together, in both my online journal and my private one. Nothing motivates me anymore :/ I'm thinking about taking next semester off of school too. I'm not sure WSU is the right place for me and I think that I need to work and save up my money and leave this town that I live in and venture some place else and on my own. I need a vacation or something :/<br /><br />Still don't have things worked out with English so it looks like I'm going to just drop the class and pray I never have that fat fuck again. Fuck the asymmetrial triangle because its stupid. I should be allowed to say whatever I want and voice my opinions without being lashed out at but no. My WS teacher wonders why I never participate in class and its because of my English teacher and the way he makes me feel. School isn't on my good side though. I am, however, doing good in two of my four classes. That's not really anything to look forward to but its better than bombing all four or something.<br /><br />Thanksgiving is right around the corner, which just gives my family another reason to get together and fight. I'll be at my dad's and my house/my aunt's. I invited Craig over and he said that he's coming and that he won't chicken out, but I think that my family will scare him away. Blah ... holidays suck in my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Random fact of the day : I still have all three fish and a newt that keeps growing ...</p>"

"event","So obviously my school semester is half over with and what do I have to do during this upcoming week, drop a fucking class. With only about five weeks in the semester left, I am forced to do it. Why? Because my fat fucking teacher hates me so he does anything in his power to fuck with me. <br /><br />Three weeks ago he shows up ten minutes late and I'm like fuck this shit so I get up and walk out. Just so happens that I walk right past him and he goes into class and says ""I guess I was too late for Erin to stay"" First off fuck you because you shouldn't bring me up if I'm not there to defend myself. He's a prick to me about it later when I asked him a simple question. <br /><br />Two weeks ago he's twenty minutes late so I'm already pissed off about this, but I have to stay so I sit there not doing anything of any importance. He's in class a total of twenty minutes and what does he do, he kicks me out. When I e-mailed him about the fact that its bullshit that he was late two weeks in a row and about the fact that I pay him and he should be on time. In the e-mail, I also said how he owed me an explanation onto why he kicked me out because I wasn't doing anything wrong, he became an even bigger douche. He made me feel like shit so I obviously didn't e-mail him back. <br /><br />Last week class was cancelled but I didn't get the memo until 5 pm. Yeah, class starts at 5:30 so I spend four hours on campus downtown just to find out that class is cancelled. When I e-mail him he doesn't respond back. I'm like sweet. I seriously despise the guy. <br /><br />Two days ago in class, things seemed ok. He wanted to talk with me about what happened. So after everyone leaves its about 8:30 because for once he let us out early and not late. We start talking and at first things seemed ok until I started telling him exactly how I felt. I told him that him and my classmates make me feel like shit almost every class and how I don't feel like he's teaching me anything. How I hate most of the readings and maybe its because I don't understand them but I hate them. He starts chewing me apart to the point where I got really fucking upset. I even started crying, seriously who's college INSTRUCTORS make them cry. My fucking teacher who looks like the comic book guy from the Simpsons except with a gross beard and an almost bald head and mullet. I decide that I shouldn't have to take anymore of his mean remarks so I pick up my book bag extremely upset and I go to walk out of class. He says something to me about it and I go I'll be in class next week. He goes that's not an option as I'm out the door. I turn around and walk back in and go what do you mean that's not an option. He goes we're going to finish this conversation or you aren't welcome back in class. I go fine then sign my FUCKING DROP PAPER and as I turn around to walk out I go you FUCKING ASSHOLE. <br /><br />How the hell do I get two bad English teachers in two consecutive semesters. For fuck sake, I'm an English major. So with five weeks left in the semester, I'm forced to drop my class so that I don't get an F or an INC which completely screws me over for next semester. This puts me under twelve credit hours for the semester now and unless I can pull off a miracle probably won't be able to go back next semester because I'll lose my FASA money and I'm so extremely stressed out. My back is tense all the way down and my hair's falling out, I haven't really been in the mood to eat and I got to the point where I just want to stay in bed forever. <br /><br />To make matters worse, my mom lost her job last week and my dad doesn't feel like he has to pay child support for my sister anymore. I know I'm an adult now but I'm pretty much putting myself in debt with my life right now. I'm going to have to start paying my car insurance come next month and I also have a few other bills to pay. Maybe its good that I might not be able to go back to school next semester so I can work a shitload of hours at work, that's if I don't lose my job, and save up money so that I can pay off all of my bills and try to work something out. Someone shoot me in the fucking heart to end all of this misery.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Enjoy ...""><img alt=""this is the boy"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/ernhatzu/115327750_371368665_0.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong><sub><sup>this is the boy being goofy</sup></sub></strong></div>"

"event","Hey you guys. Its been a while since I last updated and there's been so much that I've wanted to say. <br /><br />Steve came home last week [Oct. 7] and I was so scared and nervous to see him since it had been nine months. From the moment I walked in the door at Matt's, I thought that things were meant to be. We embraced each other and he gave me a kiss, but that turned in to unwanted feelings and not knowing what was going on. In the last eight days, I've only seen him three times. This is something that I've wanted for so long and now that its here, I slowly see it slipping from view. I can't be with someone that isn't going to want to be with me, been there done that before and I don't want it again. He leaves in under a month anyway, but it just sucks. I feel like I've spent the last nine months of my life just waiting around for something that I knew deep down inside wasn't going to happen anyway. Why don't I ever listen to my gut feelings? They're normally always right anyway ... <br /><br />I've been working at the bookstore at the mall for just about two months now and I noticed these cute Cingular boys. I just started talking to them and the one Craig is amazing. Its weird how life does that to you. Its made me really put the whole Steve situation into perspective and not just because I met another guy but because Craig reminds me so much of Tyler, who I compare every guy too. Man oh man, things are so weird right now. I mean I can sit on the phone with Craig for an hour and just laugh and say stupid shit or go over his house and play the 360 and we make fun of each other and its great. I hang out with Steve and I feel partly uncomfortable and like I don't fit in with him and his friends. Maybe its because I'm younger then them or I don't do the things they do. I don't believe in God, as most of you know, but me and Chanel were talking about all of this and we think its fates way of showing me that I can date a really nice guy who actually wants to be with me over someone that I would question. <br /><br />Any advice? <br /><br />My birthday is in eleven days too and I'm not actually looking forward to that. No one from my family is going to be home so I'll probably be working and then going out with my friends because they won't forget or at least I hope they won't forget. Every year since my brother's death, my birthday has gotten worse and worse. Maybe its because I'm not going to be 21 yet and my friends are older or maybe its just because people are to caught up in their own lives to worry about anyone else. It completely sucks but you get used to it. Hopefully this birthday is better than the last one, not gift wise or anything but because my friends won't forget and they'll make the day special for me :] I love them dearly ... <br /><br />Well I must be going, I have to start getting ready for work and I'm having breakfast with Craig :] I'm on a roll lately and I'm actually finally happy surprisingly regarding the circumstances. Hope that you guys have a great day and wish me luck on my Japanese midterm on Wednesday. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://myspace-798.vo.llnwd.net/01286/89/76/1286556798_l.jpg"" /> <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://myspace-039.vo.llnwd.net/01286/93/08/1286558039_l.jpg"" /> <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://myspace-571.vo.llnwd.net/01290/17/51/1290961571_l.jpg"" />"

Two weeks ago I had to drop my IPOD and my laptop off to be fixed. The other day I get a phone call saying that they're just going to exchange my old one for a new one. That means that I got a brand new laptop with double everything than my last one but I have to put everything back onto it. I almost cried. When I had to change my wireless connection I put an encryption code on my internet to secure it, forgetting that my neighbor uses it. I had to give him the code today so let's hope it worked. My IPOD got a new hard drive which means there's nothing on that either. Stupid technology.

I like three of my four classes at school. I'm starting to hate my Japanese class, I realized the other day that I can't due it. I could still drop it but if I do I won't be a full time student and that won't work. I love my other three classes though. My workload is so much and I'm starting to freak out. However, I wrote my English paper that isn't due for another three weeks and finished my act already and did my Japanese homework. I guess if I just do my homework everyday then I'll be ok, but I'm freaking out.

Steve comes home in 6 days and I'm so excited. Still nervous but excited about his homecoming. He sent me a message online last night and I always seem to miss him when he IMs me but in six days he'll be home. Kristin also comes home this weekend so hopefully I'll be able to see her. My birthday is in 25 days and I'm not 21 yet but I don't care about my birthday anymore. Its just another day that everyone seems to forget. Maybe my 21st in another year will be better.

I'm actually smiling :D How are my friends doing?"

"event","<p>I don't know why I bother to write in here occassionally anymore. It seems like a waste of my time. I mean there really isn't a point in sharing with any of you when in the end you don't give a shit anyway.<br /><br />I feel like I'm headed downward again and I don't know why nor can I seem to stop these thoughts and feelings. For once in my life since my brother's death I thought that I could actually be ok, but boy that idea was stopped way short of being accomplished. I thought that with school starting up and Steve's return home I would be ok, but boy was I wrong. By the way, Steve leaves Iraq within the next few days to go back to Japan, which mean he will come home within the next three weeks. Just shy of his homecoming, it will have been almost nine months since we've seen each other and boy am I stoaked to see him. Anyway, back to what I was saying ... School is overwhelming and to be honest, I don't know how I""m going to survive the semester, let alone the year plus a few spring/summer classes. I thought that I would be ok and that I would be able to handle my class load but I was mistaken. I had to drop my English class today and pick up a different one, the workload would have made me want to kill myself and would have been too much with my other three classes. Its a good thing that I made a few friends in my classes because maybe they can help me ... I'm stressed out.<br /><br />I feel all of these stupid thoughts coming back to my mind and I wish that I could stop them but I can't. When I need a friend to help me I don't feel like talking or hanging out with anyone. Yes being alone isn't always the answer, but I'm back to putting up walls and being secretive. Its nothing against any of you, I just personally don't want to talk to any of you and sometimes I'm not so sure you guys care anyway. Its a struggle to live and to be accepted by people. I want to be the one my parents talk about and the one my sisters and brother look up too, but instead I feel like a fuck up and a worthless piece of shit. I want people to know that I really am trying to be successful, but I feel like no matter how much effort I put into things I won't be able to accomplish my dreams or my goals. Everything that I want to do in my life is fading and there's a lot of days where I don't even want to get up in the morning because I feel like I won't be able to handle the day; which sometimes is actually the case. I wish that I had some answers to stop these feelings, but I don't. I have so many dreams that I want to accomplish but it seems like I will be a failure forever and just one person in my family to fail. I feel like no matter how much I try I won't succeed and that seriously scares me. </p>
<p>Today is also the five year anniversary of September 11 and it seems like just yesterday. I was a fourteen year old child sitting in my English class with Mrs. Case when the first plane hit and I remember watching it on tv and being in complete shock. Why could something like that happen? Why would anyone let it happen? Speculations and five years later, there are still no answers. We're fighting a war, which I support and have friends fighting in, but that will never seem to come to an end. I just want to go back when life was simple and things like this didn't happen to the US. The simple times where you didn't have to worry about your family and friends sleeping in the desert and trying to not get killed. Back to a time where politics was something I didn't really worry that much about because I was a mere child and political debates were something I was never a part of. Back to a time where things would be ok. I don't know how much of you care, but this day will always be with me. I remember the victims and still pray for their families and children they will never know. NEVER FORGET. Pray for the troops and one day they will all come home.</p>

"event","so i'm sitting in my room talking to an old friend and listening to my pretty rad Ten Tragic CD and a million and one things are crossing my mind. everytime i sit down to write in here i always draw a blank at what to say. for some reason things have not been flowing like they usually do and i don't know how to fix that.

my twentyth birthday is less than two months away and i'm not going to lie, that kinda freaks me out. where am i headed in life and what am i going to do, if anything ? i'm completely lost and have no answers for anything. i finally just figured out what i wanted to do in life and if my plan goes well i should be done with school in another three years. i start my third year in just under two weeks and i can't even believe it because i haven't done anything.

jim would have his twenty-nineth birthday in five days and instead he's been gone almost five years. its a surprise how much time flies when you aren't even thinking about things. there are days when i miss him more than other days. there's a lot of times where i call out to him like he can hear me and help me like he used to be. when i need help with the wicked curve balls that life throws my way, i don't have any nor does anyone else. god, i so desperately wish that he could help me with everything. if i could turn back time i would because maybe then i wouldn't be so unhappy. don't get me wrong, i try a lot to make things better but i am a small part to my own happiness.&nbsp;

i wish that i was a six year old little girl again. hanging out in the street with my friends/neighbors were the greatest days ever. not having to worry about broken hearts and growing up. skinning knees and showing off scars were cool. i miss those days :/"

"event","<p align=""left"">so much has been going on over the last week. i spent almost all of last week at my dad's house and then went to the speedway for the weekend. i haven't been talking to very many people because of the circumstances, but my best friend was around when i needed her and she babysit my babies for me [who i get back today] lets hope bear wasn't a bully to bandit ...<br /><br />i got into a huge fight with my mom last week about my school semester. she had almost all of my money for the semester and spent it and then didn't tell me about it so three weeks before the semester i have to ask her about it and she tells me that she doesn't have it. i know that things come up and you need to understand my situation about it, which is a little personal to put in my livejournal. so i decide to just leave my house so i go and stay at my dad's for a few days. wasn't that great over there because of my brother who gets on my nerves, but i just needed to get away from my mom. i worked and went for a job interview [which i got] and then went to michigan international speedway for the weekend and decided to come home. me and my mom are on speaking terms, which is more than i can say about last week. i just don't know what i'm going to do.<br /><br />i went to both nascar races this year and the june race was better even though it got red flagged because of the rain. i like going because it gets me away and i love being able to escape on top of the motorhome and watch the race in person and have nothing to worry about. t and this year it just wasn't that great. i mean i don't drink, but still have an amazing time, but the drunks are really starting to bother me. i did see michael, brent, and drew again :] i told them i'd go back in june but i'm not one hundred percent on that because i don't know if i want to go. i get hounded by a bunch of guys to flash them, which i don't do and then i have people say shit to me about going to bed early and not drinking. its just something that you get used to but it sucks because i hate being hounded over stupid shit as my choices in life. if i go back in june i'm going to take my tent and just pitch it behind the motorhome or something. i can put up with the noise of the generators around me, but i don't want to share a tiny bed or listen to people snoring all night long. i think i would get more sleep. ugh, stupid choices.<br /><br />so i made a new friend at the beginning of the month and then on saturday we almost stopped talking in general because of some things left unsaid. i was really hurt that we weren't going to be friends because he's a great guy and we get along really well and have a lot in common. we met up yesterday and talked and we got everything worked out. we're going to be friends and nothing more. i mean i'm completely head over heels for steve and am not risking that since i've been waiting seven months for him to come home and he's almost home. these last few months have gone by fast for me, but i still miss him everyday and can't wait for him to come home.<br /><br />well there's nothing else for me to say other than i get to see my best friend for the first time in over a week and i get my babies back and tigers game tonight :]<br /><br /></p>

"event","So yesterday as whoever reads this knows, I got extremely pissed off because my long entry didn't save, but that doesn't stop me from writing. I know you all hate reading my long pointless entries but that isn't going to change anything because I'm still not going to stop writing about nothing in particular. 

over the last two days i've been extremely sad and there's only two people that i told about why because they're the only two people to actually ask and take notice to my sudden mood change. I'm not going to go into a long explanation about why because frankly it doesn't really matter to any of you anyway. I'll probably be like this for a few more days but I have things to look forward to over the next few days so that should help a little bit. I just wish I knew :[ 

My cousin's officially fly into Michigan in exactly fourty eight hours from now and I'm competely stoaked to see them and my aunt. Its been a long two years since I last seen them and probably won't see them again until next summer when my oldest cousin Brian graduates from high school. It sucks that they live so far away and I hate the heat but we all make sacrifices for things that are important to us.&nbsp; 

My sister's graduation party is on Sunday, which means I get to talk to a lot of people and see a lot of people that I haven't seen in ages. I'm not sure that's a good thing either. I hate how there's so many problems with my family and I go forever without seeing my dad's whole side. The only reason I see them occassionally now is because they seem to think we should care a little more since Jim's death. I frankly think that they should all crawl back under their stupid rocks and stay out of my life, but some people will disagree with me on that. I guess its pretty sad when the last of your grandparents is slowly dying and you don't even give a damn. People will think that makes me cold hearted, but if you ask me, I'm not. Why should I care when they never did? I don't want to be the bigger person ... Never did Never will

The funniest thing I've seen in a long time was drunk older men tip their canoe and then ask us to flash them. I told a handful of people that I had a little more class than that because I wasn't showing them my boobs. I hate how drunk people get. However, I did get three free beers and a jello shot :] and Glen gave me free beads like he always does.&nbsp;

Seen Luke today for the first time in ages at Veronica's graduation party. I guess it sucks living far from people and not being able to see them ever. Busy people with busy schedules I guess.

"event","holy effin crap, i barely write in here but when no one really comments, why do i waste my time? i waste my time because i like sharing my thoughts and feelings with strange people. ok not really because most of them are my friends but still. this time i don't really have much to say and i don't really feel like complaining so i'm just going to write like i always do ...

work is starting suck now. sometimes my sister's gets in these stupid moods and puts me down and makes me feel like shit. all over dumb things too. today i locked her door and she seemed pissed off about it and said something to me, but when i don't lock her door and she wants me to i still seem to get bitched at for it. my boss scheduled me for a store on thursday night at six pm, clearly knowing that i was going out of town friday morning. the store is in muskegon and its nine or ten hours long and i need the hours and the money, but why should i have to rush to get home on time just to drive another two to three hours up north for the canoe trip. i don't want to sleep all day on friday. i e-mailed my boss and she didn't say anything back so i was just like whatever and my sister's like bitching to me about it. then i hear that donna, who does the scheduling, said that she's going to start making the schedule for who comes to and wants to work. reality check i've worked everyday since i started there and my availibility isn't for nights or friday-sunday but i get scheduled for these stores and work them anyway. i don't see the big deal aobut taking one more day off because i'm going out of town and already have a million and one things to do for that. stupid work :/ my mom said she'd help me with a job application for something else, which is completely different hours but a set schedule everyday. we'll see.

other than work nothing else has been going on. i scheduled my classes for school. i have all day monday and wednesday classes and then one class late on tuesday in farmington hills. i decided that i couldn't keep going five days a week so i set them up for all day and i don't really care. let's see how well that goes. i'm not going to put my classes yet incase that changes but wish me luck because they will probably be tough.

summer's almost over with, which means, steve comes home, school starts back up and i have a birthday. this year i only want cards and phone calls. whoever forgets it i'm going to be mad so don't bother making up excuses or anything because i probably won't care anyway.

on a good note desi came up from ohio for the day yesterday. chanel and i met up with nancy, chris, james, gabe, desi's mom, her dad and her at number six or something in novi. we hung out at the hookah bar for a few hours just talking and catching up on old times. when we left there her parents did their own thing and chanel, desi, nancy, james and i drove back to james' house so they could get some hydro and we hung out there for a few hours. i hope james' brother is ok because he got jumped on the way back from the d or something. i haven't talked to desi so i don't know what happened just hope he's ok. me and chanel decided to drive to dearborn after we left james' to get some wings from bailey's. we walked in and everyone gave us hugs like i wanted to be touched or something. eliss kept looking at me funny and i wanted to be like what the fuck is your problem because i didn't like him but then i quit so yeah. i haven't been there in over a month and everyone was glad to see us. we mingled while we waited for our food, which we didn't check until we got to my house and our order was wrong and i was fucking pissed. chanel left to go home and i went to bed.

why is it that when i have a day off and its summer vacation i can't fucking sleep. i hate being up for almost twenty-four hours and going to bed just to sleep for four or five. seriously, i think i need some sleeping pills so that i can actually get some sleep every night. i hate it :/ but i guess its the story of my life because its been going on like this for way too long.

hopefully tonight out with some friends will lighten my mood but so far nothing can change this. ugh i'm going to lock myself in my room for a few hours and become anti-social again for those few hours. taking some pills and laying down for a few hours."

"event","<p align=""left"">so a few hours ago i arrived home from my weekend away and let me tell you that i miss it already. we never get to go up north anymore because we're all so busy with our own lives and work and such. on friday andrea and i met some boys at the ice cream place. they wanted us to go party with them but they never called. the one kid called me on saturday but i never called him back. i'm not looking for anything and i don't want anything, but its nice when guys actually notice me even when i'm wearing a t-shirt and some athletic shorts with my hair a mess and my glasses on with no make-up. it makes me wonder about what i'm doing wrong and it makes me think about the past. why do i screw everything up nowadays? save me the 'your young speech' but i want to find 'him' and i want to know that i'm appreciated. for once in my life since aaron moved away and jim died i want to be loved. i want to stop seeing everyone so happy knowing that i'll probably never be that way. this <u><font color=""#ffffff"">mf</font></u> blows<br /><br />so much has been going on lately and i definitely can't handle it. i pulled out my razor for the first time the other day. yes i said i'd give it up but i can't. <strong><font color=""#808080"">[</font><font color=""#333399"">if you want to walk away then i'm not going to&nbsp;stop you</font><font color=""#808080"">]</font> </strong>i did stop taking the pills though. i just figured it was pointless when they stopped doing anything for me. its times like this that i wish i was a drug addict so that i could escape for real. i want to know what it feels like to not have any emotions and to not let anything bother you ... maybe one day ...<br /><br />why do people lie? why can't anyone just grow some fucking balls and tell me the truth. i'm done trying when the only thing i get in return is a kick in the ass. i deleted a handful of people off of my buddy list on AIM and if you IM me then i probably won't respond. i also deleted about thirty people or so off of my MS friends list and if you send me another friend request or a message i probably won't respond either. i just hate being treated like a piece of shit. you always feed me lies and i've been believing them for years but i finally realized that i'm a fucking moron for listening to you for so long. i'm done with your shit so i hope that you're happy and forget my name, number and everything else about me because i want nothing to do with you.<br /><br />i wish that jim was here to give me some advice on everything that's going on. i wish that i could go back four years to when this all started and prevent it from ever getting started. i wish that i could change some decisions that i made and change the way i not only went about things but also with who i became friends with and who i let in to my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />amanda had her baby - tristan 5 lbs. 10 oz.&nbsp;@ 8:30 am on june 29, 2006<br />chelsey had her baby - alexia 8 lbs. 3 oz. @ 1:30 pm on july 2, 2006<br /><br /><font size=""7"">disappearing</font></p>"

"event","lately i've been completely and utterly broken. nothing is going my way and i don't know how to deal with it or what to think about it. i thought that things were going good for me and that everything was finally falling into place the way that it was meant to be, but boy was i wrong. things have taken a turn for the worse and i don't know what to make of any of it anymore. i thought that it was just me that was screwed up, but turns out it isn't. i just wish that i could go back to about fifteen years to a point in my life where i was happy. regardless of my dad leaving and him lying to not only me but also my brothers and sisters. to a time where i was a kid with skinned knees and no broken hearts and no disappointments. where i could play with the neighborhood kids and feel like one of them rather than actually being a lot younger. where my best friend didn't seem to care that i was a girl and my brothers were both around and looking out for me. ugh ... life sucks major ass.

i talked to adam last night on the phone for twenty-five minutes and it was nice to have a civil conversation with him and no jokes. he listened to me and it helped to have a friend around. he said that he had bad news and i asked what and he said that in november he was going back to iraq for a year. i seriously wanted to cry. i mean when he first went over there i was fine with it because i didn't really know him and he was chanel's friend and i only had talked to him a few times. don't get me wrong though, i was worried about him a lot. he came home in january and we drove down to north carolina to see him and spend a little bit of time with him and i got to know him. he's a great guy. the week after we come home steve has to leave to go back to japan. while he's in japan he finds out that he's going to iraq. so now i have to deal with the guy i've been in love with for five years going over there. i'm worried sick about him, but there's nothing i can do other than hope he's ok. he comes home in september just for adam to leave for italy in october and then iraq in november. i'm heart broken that this is happening to people that mean a lot to me. i mean i knew the war was going on and i knew that people were fighting for our country but it never hit home until i personally knew people going over there. i miss steve everyday and will be glad when he comes home just to miss adam like crazy. ugh :/ i'm sad

there's another thing going on that i don't want to talk about :/

there are two good things happening though. on friday after work i'm going up north for another weekend away. i get to miss stefani's nineteenth birthday party at the lake though. i'm just glad that i get to get away again and that it'll probably be the first and last time i'll go up all year. we're taking both dogs so that'll be a pain but oh well. i guess lucy has to learn to be able to ride in the car for more than a half an hour at a time. let's hope that she holds off on getting sick this time. buddy went to the vet on friday and turns out he lost about four pounds which made me extremely happy. he's back on his medication and we're hoping that he can lose about seven more pounds. keep your fngers crossed for my baby. i don't want anything serious to happen to him but if he doesn't keep losing weight than something might. i'm really worried&nbsp;about&nbsp;him.&nbsp;

so i'm thinking about selling my concert tickets on e-bay. the veronica's had to cancel the tour and i was only going to see them. i mean, i despise ashlee simpson. my tickets are pretty much going to waste. its good to know that spending over a hundred dollars on them was pointless. we were sitting tenth row center too. luck definitely isn't on my side lately. life blows

well i gotta go take a shower and try to sleep tonight :/ i gotta work bright and early in the morning. oh yeah and in case you noticed my livejournal had a make-over, its not staying like this. i messed it up some how so i'm working on fixing it."

"event","<p><font face=""franklin gothic book"">Over the past few years I've seen myself fall <font size=""1"">[a lot]</font> and I can't say that I like who I have become, but I have learned to except it. I have excepted the fact that I will never see nor talk to my brother Jim again and that in itself is hard. I've realized that no matter how hard I try to be in my brother Ryan's life I can't change anything about him or who he will become. I have learned that my dad really doesn't care about me, but acts like it at times to try and tell other people that he is a good person. I have come to the conclusion that my sisters Andrea and Jackie are only out for themselves and want me to always help them but they will never help me or they always seem to forget. How convenient? I know that my brother Keith doesn't care and is only out for himself too. My mom only cares when she wants to.</font></p>
<p>My whole life I've been disappointed and let down by what seems to be everyone and as the days go by and I get older and learn more, things never change. My dad left when I was five years old and hasn't been around since. I lost my best friend Aaron when I was eight years old and he was the one that didn't care what my sex was. We were kids having fun and being pains, but we truly loved each other and the day he moved was one of the hardest days. I miss him so much. When I was fourteen my brother Jim died and I remember it all like it was yesterday. Ever since then all of the guys I've ever known have let me down or disappointed me in more ways than I can even explain. It seems as if everyone is still letting me down and disappointing me. Now I try to act like it doesn't bother me, but it eats away my insides and just makes me more depressed. I wish that I could read their minds and see how they feel or at least get them to tell m how they felt. I wish I knew :/ because it'd be better than wondering everyday.</p>
<p>Everyday I think about my past. <font size=""1"">[I know I shouldn't think about it]</font> I wonder about what would happen if I would have done everything differently and how I would be a different person. All of the thoughts are there and I'm trying to not let them overcome me and take over, but its getting harder and harder for me. The pill taking never seems to go away and its become the only way that I can actually get a few decent hours of sleep a night. I get a lot of migranes now and I take a lot of aspirin on a daily basis. I know that its not good and that I shouldn't depend on it like I do, but for me it helps. The cutting idea never disappears. I push it all to the back of my head and try to lock it behind the black door, but it always comes back. The urge is always there I just fight it. Sometimes I break down and I do it. Not bad like before, but still not good to do. Its sometimes my only escape from this so called life that I live. I know you all think its horrible and look down upon me, but your opinions are starting to not matter to me anymore. I am my own person with my own feelings that I wish you all would take into consideration. I'm lucky if I eat one meal a day, but lately I haven't even done that much. I'm back down to 105 lbs. but when I look in the mirror I still see someone that could lose more and I feel fat all of the time. </p>
<p>I know that everyone tells me to accept life and realize that I can't change anything. Telling me that I shouldn't be sad or depressed doesn't change how I feel. I wish that people would stop hiding things from me and just tell me the truth. I know that the truth hurts but I would rather know it and be able to except it and move on than be told lies and in the end I'm just as sad and depressed as ever. Try helping rather than judging and stop being two faced and care about how I feel. </p>
<p>There's so much more that I want to say but I'm not ready to just yet. Until my next stupid little rant in this thing that I call my blog. Leave me alone to have feelings that I'm done hiding. I'm human and its finally ok for me to show my feelings. Sometimes I need to feel alive and stop feeling so dead :/</p>"

"event","<p>I'm going to add another entry to this empty space that I call my LiveJournal. Everytime I sit down in front of my computer, working up what I'm going to write about, a million thoughts start to rush through my head and I can never muster up the words to make my thoughts make sense. Hence the fact that I have not updated in a while.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font color=""#993300"">Buddy</font></strong> <font size=""1"">(my dog)</font> is really irritated with <strong><font color=""#333333"">Lucy</font></strong> <font size=""1"">(my sister's dog)</font> lately. She's about eighteen weeks old and my dog is about nine years old. She tries to play with him and sometimes he'll play back, but when either he's had enough or she's just bugging him, he will let her know. Two days in a row he's made her cry bad and I think its funny, which is probably wrong, but she needs to learn that he doesn't want to be bothered. Sometimes I feel bad, but there's nothing that I can do about it.<br /><br /><strong><font color=""#ff6600"">Jack</font></strong> graduates from high school on Thursday and I'm definitely really excited about that. I feel old though because my little sister graduates. If Ryan makes it that far then I'm really feel old, seeing as how he's only twelve right now. To change the topic really quick, does anyone other than me think its weird that <strong><font color=""#ff0000"">Jim</font></strong> <font color=""#3366ff"" size=""4"">(RIP)</font> was nine years older than me and <strong><font color=""#00ccff"">Ryan</font></strong> is eight years younger than me. Man, my dad really wanted kids I guess. I'm helping with Jack's all night party because I feel bad for my mom. I mean for some reason, non of the parents wanted to help this year and they were pretty desperate. I guess you make sacrifices for your family when they need help.</p>
<p>I've been hanging out with <strong><font color=""#ffff00"">Jessi</font></strong> a lot lately :] regarding some things that have been going on. I know that she'll be ok in the end, but this is the hardest part for her to go through. I'm trying my hardest to be a good friend towards her, but sometimes I don't think that I am. She's a great person and deserves the best, I just wish that not only she could see it but also everyone else. Seen <strong><font color=""#00ff00"">Chanel</font></strong> a lot more lately too :] I love my friends!<br /><br />I'm still jobless but hopefully that changes within the next few days. Still missing <font color=""#993366""><strong>Steve</strong></font>, but the days are actually going by fast, only about two and a half more months until he <font size=""1"">(hopefully)</font> comes home.&nbsp;School starts up in September, which means I need to get motivated for the fall semester. Michigan International Speedway in two weekends <font color=""#0000ff""><strong><u><font size=""4"">#12</font></u></strong><br /></font><br />Well its time for me to take some drugs and get some sleep. Hope you all are doing well.</p>"

"event","wow, i can't even describe how i'm feeling at this exact moment. i have had some good days and some bad days, but even if i don't act like it, they've been mostly good. i've opened my eyes and realized so much shit. i decided to stop wasting my time on stupid people and i'm not bothering with everyone that walks all over me.

i quit my shitty job. i decided that i couldn't handle my managers making me feel like an idiot, customers harassing me on a daily basis, 90% of the servers treating me like i'm a piece of shit, and managers that are fucking douche bags. i wasn't going to quit or at least not yet, but on tuesday night i decided that i couldn't handle it anymore and i walked up to stefan and said i'm giving you my weeks notice i quit. i'm working my last three days and that's it. i have a job lined up and i'm going to work at my dad's next week so i'm only really not going to be working for a few days. i'm complaining to corporate too because its bullshit. they lost me as a worker because they treated me like shit and didn't care for my well-being. i know that there's going to be people and managers that you don't get along with and that you hate but those people that i worked for are plainly stupid. everyone at bailey's can eat shit :D

i went and got my hair done today because i got paid and it needed to be done. while jenny's putting some highlights in, i got the best phone call ever. steve called me :D and i was really excited. we talked for a half an hour and jenny finished my hair. its a little short because it needed to be trimmed and its not black or blonde anymore. i decided i needed a change, maybe if you guys are lucky i'll post some pictures.

jessi i hope that you cheer me and i know that i'm not a good friend but i want to try to become a better one.

well i'm off to find something for dinner. hope you all are doing well and i'll update soon."

"event","so just when i start to get extremely happy things mess me up again. all because i let stupid little people bring me down :/ seriously i really need to work on that i think. 

i realize time and time again that people treat me like crap and walk all over me. i say that i'm going to cut them out and i even tell them that i want nothing to do with them but does it change anything NO. time and time again i let them come back because they say they'll change and things will be different and since i only have one real friend i believe them over and over. well nothing changes and i still get treated the same way. this time i'm rally saying that i'm done for good because this isn't fair to me and never will be. 

tyler posted a myspsace bulletin that was a survey and one of the questions was how many x's are on your friend's list and he put none. i sent him a message and was like hey i'm an x and i'm on your list and then he went off to say i'm sorry i wasn't even thinking and i'm like yeah sure. god if i'm that bad of a fucking person and you don't want to be reminded of me then stop sending me mixed signals and stop being such a douche bag. 

i know that i shouldn't care because i'm completely and utterly head over heels for steve and i can't wait for him to come home, but tyler used to be such a good friend and now every other day i hate him and who he's become. i need to just say good-bye once and for all and not keep letting him back in. 

there was a fire at my work so i have no idea how long we're closed for which means that i might have to go find a new job because i can't go all of these days without working. my coworker katie called me yesterday to tell me in case i had to work and i was pissed that none of my managers called me. they're all stupid. i need to try to get a hold of one of them or something because i need to know how long i'm not going to be working for. i already lost 2 days of hours and our new pay period just started. god, i'm like screwed ... 

hope that you all are doing well and don't waste your time reading this because its pointless anyway"

steve sent me a message on myspace yesterday regarding a bulletin i posted and he also sent me a message on AIM but i was away most of the day because i had jack's softball game and i hung out with d-ana for a little while and then i worked all night. i miss him like crazy and he's still gone for about three and a half months and i'm hoping its not longer than that. i think about him everyday and the dog tag he sent me is on my bracelet so i look at it everyday and am awaiting his return home. i sent him another letter and i'm hoping that he writes me back but i won't know unless he says something or the mail comes. it takes so long and i hate it. ugh, stupid being in iraq :[ he'll be home soon enough and i'm not even sure if anything will happen between us but we'll see. i'll be sure to keep you guys posted on if he writes me or if i hear from him or anything.

i told heather that i wanted to go to her dance recital and i'm stoaked about that (let me know details and how much i owe you) i seen her dance a very long time ago. i remember being a child but i want to see her dance again. i know that she's amazing and its something that means a great deal to her and she means a great deal to me so i want to go :] i'm excited too even though its going to be extremely long, i don't care ...

other than that just been spending a lot of time at my sister's softball games. they're 11-5 and i've only missed three games :] man i'm such a good sister but only sometimes. i rarely seen chanel outside of work because i'm so busy and she's busy with coaching again this year. ugh, only a month left and then we'll both have more time.

well i'm going to go find some food and take a shower and get ready for the day. i have another softball game and work tonight. hope that you all are doing well and i miss you guys (my friends)"

"event","do you ever feel like you wish you could punch everyone in this world in the face. i feel that way a lot. i mean i try to help out other people when i can and no one can even just be nice and give me a sincere thank you. after work last night i was extremely pissed off and bitched to chanel the whole way home. i thought that it was the place i worked and my job itself that i hated, but after my shift last night i came to the conclusion that it was the people i work with that make me hate my job.

so i get to work at five minutes to five and this lady laurie calls shortly after wondering if she can bring in her FORD party since the tigers game was probably going to be cancelled. forgetting that we changed all of our happy hour specials i say yeah we can accommodate you and your 30 guests. turns out we really didn't have room for them. we move our lounge and get them straightened out and they were really nice. when laurie comes in she's a little pissed but i bull shit a story and get everything straightened up. they ended up thanking me all night long and i was like sweet, i did something right today. then i ended up doing the dishes since our dishwasher was on yet and i spent about 45 minutes doing them and seriously, only one person thanked me. maggie was actually thanking me all night because she took the FORD party with my help and at the end of the night ended up giving me $10 which i was stoaked about since i owe everyone and their brother money nowadays. it was just crazy. i did so much stuff and got nothing in return. then over the next two days or so i have to train two new people :/ which i'm not too thrilled about but oh well, we kinda need them anyway. god can't anyone just say thank me once in a while :/

stressed out and still don't have my final grade posted yet. i'm patiently awaiting and hoping i didn't bomb my final to drop it from my A. ugh life sucks again and i feel unappreciatd by everyone lately.

a few days ago i sent steve another letter so i hope he enjoys this one. i gave him my SI swim suit edition ;] i hate him being over there :/ and i'm scared, but i know that he'll be home before i know it. he still has about four months left and i worry. when i do get a chance to talk to him or he sends me a message or a letter, it makes thinkgs better for a little while. i mean, you hear stories about iraq and what's going on and you never really think about it until you personally know someone that has to go over there. now i completely understand how chanel felt when adam went over there but then he came home and things were great until i found out that steve had to go. i know that this is just something that happens that you have no control over but i hate the whole idea and just can't wait until he's home where i know that he's safe. i think about him everyday and miss him everyday too :[ 

i've been fighting with tyler a lot lately and he'll say that its over a lot of stupid and dumb things but i truly don't think that it is. you can only say 'i'm sorry' to someone so many times before you wear it out and he's been past that. i just hope he's happy because i really don't / can't be his friend anymore. ugh, i hate people.

so far i've gotten an A- B- B on my grades for school and i'm still patiently awaiting another one but when it comes i'll be so freakin happy and releaved all at the same time. i'm finally done for the summer so hopefully my stress level goes way down because i hate being like this. jack's softball team is 5-2 right now and she's playing good, i wish she didn't have to go to macomb in the fall but everyone has to start somewhere. i hate work and it seems like the regulars and chanel are the only reason why i'm still there. i'm hoping to start looking some place because i'm starting to hate the drive and i just can't handle all the drunk perverts anymore. last week i had some guy kiss my cheek when he left and i was shocked and hoped no one else would do that. i've been called 'hunnie, baby, sweetie, sweetheart' more this week than any other time and i've had people tell me they loved me. i want to be like this isn't the first nor last time i'll hear that so please go away. i think that they try flattering me, but it doesn't work at all. i just hate how all of these people are so persistent. when i'm say that i'm seeing someone it really does mean that i'm seeing someone no matter the circumstances. that means leave me alone because i'm not interested. i talk to all of the customers because that's what i do but sometimes i just wish that i could run away so i didn't have too :/ working sucks ... i just need to hurry up and finish school so that i won't have to hate my job anymore ...

do you ever feel like the person you need the most is never around. my brother jim's been gone four and a half years and it seems like i need him more now than ever before. i don't talk to my other older brother keith nor my sister's about what's going on in life. i just wish that i had jim back so that i know i'd b ok. i wish that he would have never died but there's nothing i can do about that. i wish that he could give me a sign to let me know that he was watching over me no matter what i've done or continue to do. he always loved me regardless of my flaws and every day i wish that i could turn back time and talk him out of it. every day i need him and every day that passes he's one more day gone ... life sucks :[ why do all the good ones go ? miss you and love you <b>RIP</b>

i'm not sure that i have anything else to say at the moment but my cousin gets married on friday and i can't wait. i'm so happy for them two and its about time. good-bye you all and have wonderful days"

"event","This is completely off topic from my usual entries, but as I was reading one of my American Governemnt books <b>(A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES 1492-PRESENT)</b> I came across a good few paragraphs that made me sad and sick at the same time ...

The conditions in the factories did not change much. On the afternoon of March 25, 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company that begain in a rag bin swept through the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors, too high for fire ladders to reach. The fire chief of New York had said that his ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. But half of New York's 500,000 workers spent all day, perhaps twelve hours, above the seventh floor. The laws said factory doors had to open outward. But at the Triangle Company the doors opened in. The law said the doors could not be locked during working hours, but at the Triangle Company doors were usually locked so the company could keep track of the employees. And so, trapped, the young women were burned to death at their worktables, or jammed against the locked exit door, or leaped to their deaths down the elevator shafts. The New York World reported:
<center><i>...screaming men and women and boys and girls croweded out on the  many window ledges and threw themselves into the streets far below. They jumped with their clothing ablaze. The hair of some of the girls streamed up aflame as they leaped. Thud after thud sounded on the pavements. It is a ghastly fact that on both the Greene Street and Washington Place sidese of the building there grew mounds of the dead and dying...
From opposite windows spectators saw again and again pitiable companionships formed in the instant of death--girls who placed their arms around each other as they leaped.</center></i>
When it was over, 146 Triangle workers, mostly women, were burned or crushed to death."

Brainwash us to be their patrotic slaves 
Programs our minds by controlling what we learn 
The only difference from the nazis is that

The government says they're working for us 
Just as long as we increase their pay 
But the minute they get into office we're a has-been

We've slain 
The white for this racist, bigoted foundation 
The blue for your arayan eyes -- all empty 
Empty because you're taught to bow down to the man 
""Fly that flag, that flag of freedom"" 
""Do what you can for your country"" 
Go and fight their wars for them 
""They're not following in our footsteps, 
KILL THEM!""

I just call it ignorant

"event","I've been thinking a lot and at first it seemed like I never had a reason to update this thing but it turns out that I'd rather not share my life with you guys anymore. I like being the quite personal Erin that I've always been and I know that some of you can't handle it but just leave me the fuck alone. I know that everyone wants me to be happy and such but I've been this way for ever that I'm learning to live like it. Since I was a young child I've liked being alone so stop trying to change me and if you can't handle me the way that I am then say good-bye now and I can cut you out like I do with everyone else ...

<b><center><font size=7>I need to stop with the lies too :/</b></center></font>
I know that lying is wrong but sometimes I feel like its the only thing that I can do to hide from everyone. I know that people always say that the truth is best, but I don't think that it is? Sometimes I'd rather hear the lies and not the truth, therefore, I don't always tell the truth, along with other people. I'm done with the lies ...

Me and Tyler have been talking more and I really do miss him. He's up at CMU so I never see him and that actually makes me sad. There's a lot of days when I wish that he still lived up the road because sometimes he's the only person that I want to see and talk too and rather than being a half hour away he's three hours away. At times it kills me because he's one of my best friends and obviously when I need him he can't be around. Thank god we've been talking more though because I confide in him a lot. I'm glad that we can still be friends through everything that we've been through and I can't wait to see him again ...

Wow I suck at life and now I'm going :/

"event","You know everytime I come to my LJ or this site at all, I always feel like I should update but to be honest with you all, I never want too. I'm not sure if its just because I really don't want to or if its because I'm sick and tired of sharing my life with the world. Everything I say is taken the wrong way anyway and I end up looking like a fucking douche, what's the point? I'm always the bad guy anyway. 

On Sunday at work, my manager Emily made me take a personality test and I'm a dictator. I didn't think anything of it but when I actually sit down and really think about it, everything that it said was true. I learned that I was a fucking ass and to be honest, I'm surprised that I still have fucking friends because I just treat them like shit anyway :[ I always say that I want to punch everyone in the face, but I think that everyone should want to punch me in the face for just being a controlling bitch all of the goddamn time ... I'm a horrible person ...

The urge to cut has come back and to be honest, I'm not sure why. I started to realize that life is always goin to treat me this way and I'll always be a fucking ass and a horrible person. I don't think that I'll ever find ""him"" or ever be happy. This is the first time that I've told anyone or write that the urge has come back but it seems like its getting harder to fight now. I haven't done it and I swore that I wouldn't because not only did I promise myself but also a few others. I can't keep hurting everyone with the choices that I make but its hard to fight. There's only one person on my friend's list that actually understands this part and maybe she'll agree with me on this. There are a lot of times like I think that I should get help and talk to someone but to be honest, what is a therapist going to tell me that I don't already now ... What's the point of living a useless life? Would you miss me if I disappeared today?

"event","So all day I was thinking about this entry and what I was going to say in here. Now that I'm laying in bed, in the dark, all along I don't really want to write it anymore. I'm not sure if its because I don't want to offend the whole two people that read this ( [&hearts;] you too) or if its just because I don't feel like sharing my views and beliefs with you. Maybe if I feel like writing another night I'll share with you but for now I'm not going to and just fucking deal with that ...

How come people always tell me that they will be there for me when I need a friend to talk too and they will listen to me ramble on about nothing, but in the end they never are. How come you feed me the lies? I ask myself that on a daily basis it seems like but the question I need to start asking is how come I believe you all the time? Well maybe I'll actually become fucking smarter and stop believing the words that you say but never really mean. I quit :/ and this time I actually do mean that.

So I called Tyler on my way home from work since my other friend that I wanted to talk to was busy. We talked the whole way home for me and even though he was busy we still talked. Through everything that we've been through, he said I was his best friend and I took that heart and was like awwww. I mean Chanel tells me that all of the time and I love it but out of all people, I never thought Tyler would consider me his best friend. I mailed him a birthday card but I don't think he'll get it until tomorrow but I called him at midnight to tell him happy birthday. We've been talking more lately and I really do enjoy our talks even if it is about nothing or about our past. I really do miss him and his friendship so I'm glad that we've been able to stay friends and such :]

I guess I'm going to end this since I don't want to talk about anything else. I just want to pull my covers over my head and not think about anything else. I'm getting my hair done on Saturday and I'm excited about that and the Daytona 500 is in 29 days and I can't wait for that either :] Wow I'm a loser but now I'm going so goodnight and I love my friends more than anything :]

<center><lj-cut text=""[ missyou ]""><i>Your time has already come and I don't know why 
The last thing that I had heard 
you were doin' just fine 
It seems like just yesterday 
I was laughing with you 
Playing games at Grandma's house 
well you taught me well, didn't you? 
I hope I'm just like you 

Do they have radios in heaven? 
I hope they do 
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio 
And I'm singing it to you 

You left before I had a chance to say goodbye 
But that's the way life usually is 
it just passes you by 
But you can't hold on to regrets and you can't look back 
So I'll just be thankful for the times that I had with you 
I hope I'm just like you 

Do they have radios in heaven? 
I hope they do 
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio 
And I'm singing it to you 
If they don't have radios in heaven 
here's what I'll do 
I can bring my guitar when my time is up and I'll play it for you 

Tell me can you hear me now 
if not, then I can try to sing real loud 
What's it like up on the other side of the clouds? 
I hope I'm just like you 
I hope I turn out to be as good as you </i>

"event","Well I've been writing a lot more than before because I made some odes to myself and to my friends. I started to realize that this year I need to stick by everything that I've been saying. I can't keep lying to myself nor my friends. So like they always say, a new year means a new start and that's exactly what's going to happen this year. I haven't really said much about things since the new year has started but I did make ten new year's resolutions and so far I've stuck to all ten but its only been a little under three weeks. I'm definitely making this year better.

So things are actually going good. My friends are awesome and I'm actually starting to be happy. I decided to let everyone that didn't care go because I finally realized that I needed to start saying good-bye. I am trying to rekindle a few relationships from my past that have been lost and whether or not I'm succeeding is beyond me. I need to make myself happy and by doing that I can make other people happy so that's my goal as of now. It could take a while but I'm perfectly ok with that ... its time for a new start :]

So today I'm in my Sociology class and I'm actually reading the book while I'm listening to my IPOD waiting for my teacher to come in and I came over an interesting paragraph in the book that went along with one of my previous entries so I figured I would share ... 
<center><i><font color=purple>People look in the mirror to see how others see them. If by looking, we are trying to achieve a particular look, that look has likely been established by the social forces that tell us to achieve a particular ideal -- ideals that are produced by industries that profit enormously from the products and services that people buy. Some industries suggest that you should be thinner or curvier, your pants should be baggy or straight, your breasts should be minimized or maximized. Maybe you should have a complete makeover. Many people than go to great lengths -- sometimes extreme lengths that are hazardous to physical and mental health -- to try to achieve a constantly changing beauty ideal, one that is probably not even attainable.</center></i></font>
Like I said in my previous entry, the world has become very materialistic and it actually pisses me off. I mean, I know that everyone wants to be someone or something different, but you were made the way that you are and you can't change that. I hate how the world has turned into that and it sucks ...

Well that's all that I have in me but I love my friends and actually life :]"

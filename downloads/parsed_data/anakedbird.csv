"event","Today was interesting.  I wake up this morning with hope that today will bring happiness and fun, but not that can't happen.  My friend **** touches stuff that is not his and tells my mom about it.  Got to love friends that gossip about you to your own parents.  So I can almost guarantee that he hates me now seeing as he got booted from my house.  The reasons for that will not be mentioned but it has to do with disrespect to my family and i cant tolerate that garbage.  This is hard for me.  I try my best to wlecome someone into my home expecting the same amount of respect given and I get nothing in return.  I hope my other friends see this as a reason why you can't really trust too many people in this world.
                                                               
                                                             love always"

"event","well its 2:10 am....Today was an odd day.  First off Caitlyn did bad things but now that we talked it out it's turning out better than ever.  It's wierd how bad things can make other things better.  I love her with all my heart and soul.  No matter what idstance I'll be with my angel for as long as I breathe.  With that said iI made a ham snadwhich with mayo about five mins ago  and it was amazing.  I'll update more often (i hope) I just have had lots of stuff going on, and I have not had a chance to. well g-night to all <(v_v)>"

"event","well today started with your favorite fast food restaurant (taco bell) and me working there till 5pm.  then when i got home i ate food and talked to caitlyn on the phone.  while on the phone with cait i started to get a headache and realized it was gas leaking from the stove! we called bay state gas and we were told to leave the house and await help...to put a long cold story short it took about an hour to get back in the house. then i talked to cait again...we talk about some deep stuff at times and usually we end up debating but its all good in the end because we are tight son PEACE...."

"event","well i havnt updated in a while so here it gos... christmas break was awsome first i got the computer and various computing items i asked for. then the next day i went to caits house. i had a lot of fun.  the best time i spent with her was just hanging out just the two of us in her basement, watching tv and other various activities. we was the play ""Rent"" and walked around NYC of a little bit. New years was funny we got to see eveyone drunk and caits uncle's gf was ""checking me out"" says cait... i doubt it though. so as you might have guessed being with cait was the best part by far and i cant wait to see her again..."

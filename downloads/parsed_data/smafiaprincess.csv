"event","SO, here I am sitting at home ALL day long in my bathrobe. Scary. I'm still employed  LOL   Yesterday, I was doing the chicken dance with my three year olds. I fell down afterwards (in joking). Then, when I started to get up, the room started spinning. I explained it to the nurse like this ""it's kinda like when you drink lots of liquor and it hits you ALL OF A SUDDEN"". Scary, but true. Anyways, i apparently scared everybody. They wouldn't let me drive home so my mother had to pick me up. yes, my name is valerie and my mommy had to pick me up from work. I felt like I was sixteen again. HA   It was pretty damn scary though. Anyways, the doctor said I may have an inner ear infection, wrote Vertigo in my chart.....and sent me on my way!  UGH
Anyways, I talked to Carl  (SMILE SMILE)  He called to check on me and kept offering to ditch classes to come home and take care of me. Isn't he precious! What a fabulous guy I have!  tee hee tee hee
Anyways, I'm back to vegging out!!!!!"

"event","Well, I just got back from Greenville seeing my ""boyfriend"". OH YES, I can call him my boyfriend now. We had the talk!!!!! He's precious
I must say that I am a little freaked out at the moment though. Right before I left, I had my head on his shoulder in the car talking. We were both talking about how it was weird that we had only been out a couple of times (although we talk on the phone EVERY single day) and we already feel like we are in this serious relationship. As I wwas trying to get the balls to say something along the lines of ""i really like you and I can see myself falling for you"" or ""I could really see myself falling for you""....homeboy just blirts it out! He said he had love for me...and then said ""I love you"". And how big of an ass am I? I said nothing back!!!!!!!!!   It just kinda freaked me out. It was awesome!!!!!!! It just totally shocked me. I'm not used to a boy who expresses his feelings so well.......and about ME! I didn't say thank you or anything...I just did my nervous giggle and kissed him. A few moments later, I told him that it was scary. He said that he was sorry, he didn't mean to scare me. He just believes in telling it like it is. WOW   I told him that it was really nice to hear...to which he repeated it a few times!  but I couldn't bring myself to say it back. I REALLY REALLY like him and I can totally see myself feeling that strongly about him VERY soon. I just couldn't say it tonight! As soon as he said it, I saw jerkface in my head. NOT because I love HIM or because I want him in ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!!!!! It's just that he was the only boy that I ever even thought about telling that to and when I tried...he laughed in my face pretty much. MAFIA    I just really hope that I don't let my hangups from that relationship doom this one. Carl is such a great guy and I honestly do feel like I am falling for him. What do I do? Am I a horrible person?"

THEN, the boy asks me for my address so that he can send me something for Valentines Day. He wrote me a sonnet...which was precious. AND he sent me a dozen pink roses. How precious is he?!?!?!?!?!?  We talk almost everyday. He calls me honey and sweetie ALL of the time. I feel totally comfortable talking to him...and I am going to see him in Greenville tomorrow. I mentioned a hotel and he quickly brought up the topic of ""boofin"". He said that he really likes me and he feels so honored to have met such a nice girl that he doesn't want to ruin it with anything physical yet. He wants what we have to be pure. Granted, I do want to have sex again one day....but he's just so damn sweet. Maybe this will be good for me. Either way, I really really like him and he does make a point. He's a good kisser anyways. :)   I can't wait to see him tomorrow!"

Okay, that's being a little TOO hopeful BUT he is so sweet! I stayed with my friend Sherry last night and tonight. She gave me a key since she would be out of town today. So, Carl came to pick me up here. (Sherry's)   I gave him directions so OF COURSE he got lost. oopps.  Anyways, he opened the car door for me! He hugged me ,he asked if he could hold my hand on the way to the Italian place. He's Italian...did i mention that? Anyways, we had really good conversation at dinner. He told me about his family and he got accepted into grad school for this summer. woo hoo   After dinner, we went to his house. I met his dad and his little sister. They are precious too. :)   After they left the room, we started watching Starsky and Hutch. I didn't see much of the movie bc we made out the whole time. JUST made out! PRECIOUS! Make  out sessions are the best by the way. Damn my tickleishness though. Embarassing   HA HA HA    Anyways, he told me the he wanted to date me. He told me I had beautiful eyes and that he loved loooking at me  *sigh*   Precious
He brought me back here and met Sherry and Eric. They only said hello really quick bc Carl wasn't feeling so great and wanted to get back home. I walked him to the door....he kissed and hugged me, told me that he had a great time and that I was a wonderful kisser  *blush*   When I walked back in, Sherry and Eric were in the dark trying to figure out the survalience camera so they could watch us. LOL   Those crazy nuts!
He called when he got home to tell me that he got there okay. He is going to call me tomorrow. te he te he     
The whole time tonight, I couldn't stop smiling. I have NEVER had a guy like me this much. It's the best feeling EVER!   Soooooo............he's precious and we are now ""dating"".  te he te he
To think, it took over TWO years to get another fellow to use the term ""dating"" and Carl up and says it on our very first date!  Wow, I'm really happy right now."

Tonight, I have my first date with Carl. It's so weird that this will be our ""first date"" because I have been talking to him for like a month now. I feel like we are in a relationship already. I'm soooooooooo excited but I'm also really really nervous. He called me last night when he got into town and we spoke for a few minutes. Then, when I got out of the concert he had left me a message telling me goodnight and he wanted to hear all about the concert! He's just so sweet. It just seems too good to be true.

"event","So, I totally met this boy at a new years eve party a couple of weeks ago. After midnight, i ended up kinda sorta hooking up with a good friend Simon. It's funny becaues just a couple of weeks ago, Simon and I had a conversation about the fact that I wanted to ""date"" NOT be a random hook up. And since I knew that wasn't what he wanted....we might as well NOT start anything.  HA   alcohol is a crazy thing.
Anyways, this guy Carl asked me for my number at the party. He's super sweet and really cute! he's a dork! What's funny is that out of ALL these thirty some year olds....the one boy that shows any interest in me is 22!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am 24 so really it's not THAT big of a deal. But I have NEVER even thought to do the younger thing. I have always been a big fan of OLDER men!  UGH   Thing is, we have talked a few times and he just seems so damn sweet! problems are: he's 22, he lives in Greenville (2hours), AND he's 22!!!!!!   he just seems genuinely sweet AND DID I SAY HE WAS ITALIAN!!!!!!!!!   HA, I'm such a sucker. I'm so glad that my love for Italian men hasn't been ruined by MAFIA!  he he he

"event","So, it's a week into the new year. This is suppose to be the time that I try to reinvent myself stopping my old annoying habits and become a better all round person. MAFIA
One of my old pals from Orlando called me last night. He was one of my best friends on the program second semester. It was so niec to hear from him. Before I knew it, it had been like two hours. Super exciting.
Well....the down part to him is that he used to live with my old ""whatever"". I had come sooooo far in my recoperation. I had been out with other guys. Hooked up with other guys. Totally went days weeks even without thinking about him. I haven't cried over him in LORD knows how long!  ""he's just not that into you""
Anyways, halfway through the conversation, my buddy says something about my ex saying ""oh, sorry. i didn't mean to mention his name.""  To which, I told him ""it's okay. I'm alright. You can mention his name. Don't be silly""   OPEN MOUTH >>>>>>> INSERT FOOT
I say ""Don't tell me details or anything, but I was going to ask you how he was doing...if he's happy.""
My friend then tells me that he is not only still with that girl that he started seeing after we ended things....but they are (wait for it) LIVING TOGETHER!?!?!??!?!?!
I held it together and HONESTLY said that I was super happy for him, WHICH I AM! I really do hope the best for him. I don't want him to be miserable by any means. AFter I got off the phone, I started thinking....I knew him for three and a half years before I could even get him to admit we were ""dating"". We ended things in the beginning of April....and it was at least a couple of weeks before they started anything. HELLO!!!!!!!!!!
I don't want to be with him. I am honestly super happy that it is over. Taking a step back has made me see the whole situation as absurd. My mom finally pointed out to me that the thing that upset me was that she was able to do much better at ""a project"" than I did.   WOW
Could it be true?   I have said for quite some time taht I always knew we wouldn't work out. I for some reason wanted to ""help him"" like I have so many other people in the past. And now that I know someone got him to actually commit.......am I bitter that the project I failed, she conquered? Weird"

Yeah, she noticed   LOL      ANyways, a little kick to help encourage me to continue going. I can't wait to be thinner....or at least get rid of this huge gut that I have grown over the last six months. BLEH

1)Lose weight, which I am doing by cutting out REAL cokes, switching to  diet pepsi and working out at curves.
2)SMoking- I have always wanted to be one of these ""social"" smokers that I totally started out being. I had one yesterday and one today. I know better than to even try to speak of cold turkey. It's better anyways.
3)Read my book ""He's just not that into you"" every single time I have boy trouble. And with that resolution....I am NOT chasing ANYONE!!!!!!

"event","Well, as usual I waited until the last minute for New Years plans....but luckily I ended up going to a friend's party in North Raleigh and having a FABULOUS time! For the first time EVER, I kissed a boy at midnight. (not secretly, but actually IN FRONT of other human beings) It was nice. Nothing big to report....he's just a friend.....with benefits i guess. 
Since I'm on the boy note here, I will say that I FINALLY went on a somewhat date Thursday night. It was an old friend, Aaron. He was my ""boyfriend"" in sixth grade, the first and only boy to ever give me a rose, AND my date to the jr prom. He is an accountant for a record company in Chapel Hill. He is also a head bartender at this very trendy bar. We had a blast. He paid, opened doors, and even walked me to my car. This could be a very ""friendly"" thing, but I enjoyed it just the same. 
Wes, the navy boy, and I are fighting. Although it is all in my head so he has no idea. I'm winning by the way  HA HA   I know that he has been home for like two weeks and FINALLY called me Thursday night when i was at dinner. IT'S LIKE HE KNEW!!!!!!!!  Anyways, we had kinda but not really made plans for new years. I even used the ""my parents are out of town if you want to come over!""  corny, I know      He called me at 9 and said ""i've had a head ache all day. I'm just gonna hang out here with my littler sister"". According to my reference book>>>>He's just NOT that into you!   Mafia
OOOOOOOOooo and before I forget. There was this really really cute boy at the party last night. He kept looking at me and finally came up and started talking to me about guitar. He plays  PRECIOUS      Anyways, he said that I looked familiar and actually I was thinking the same thing about him. God, I hope he isn't a cousin!  LOL     Anyways, he came in to say good bye to me and was like ""it was really nice meeting you Valerie."" Well, being the sneaky girl that I am....I snuck outside when I saw him heading for the door. He came out behind me wondering if I was driving home because he was worried about me. PRECIOUS    He was like ""we'll have to hang out sometime. let me get your number!""  SCORE!
By the way, this was a very hippie grunge crowd and homeboy was wearing a khakis and a light blue button up shirt. PLUS he mentioned that he is a CHEM dork! Are we made for eachother or what?!?!?    We'll see what happens.
As for the new year resolutiosn.....you can't start new stuff til Monday so.........I still have two more days to decide how I am going to become a better person and change the world!  HA

I gave everyone their presents bc I just couldn't take it anymore. I got together with my friends Sherry and Teresa today for a Christmas lunch. We exchanged presents and had lunch. It was super fun! Sherry loved her Coke cookbook and her solitaire game. Teresa loved her visor compass and her very own copy of ""He's just not that into you"". I have said it before.........but that book is pure brilliance!  LOL
So, I am very excited about it being Christmas and all....but I have to admit that this time of year, I really envy those people who have big families. Jeramy left, so now it's the three of us who live here. Me, mom, and dad. What in the samhill? Don't get me wrong, I love them all. it's just not like a big family gathering that would bring on a new holiday movie to play on TBS. Sad day
Boy update~   Jason- so five minutes ago....I really like Jason, but I have totally decided that he falls under the friend category. While he is super fun to hang out with on occassion. He is horrible at keeping a date AND he reminds me way too much of a certain jerkface we have all grown acustom to me mentioning constantly.  LOL   MAFIA
Simon~ up in the air.....Simon is a great guy that I have known for about two years now. He is really really funny and really really nice and sweet. I would totally date him, but sad day- he isn't ready for a serious relationship. He needs a better job and more money (he's 29!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Wes~ Same old, same old.....as usual I am waiting for him to call. Not waiting by the phone, mind you. But waiting just the same. I know that he is home for CHristmas. No call yet. I have thought about calling him a few times, but my reference books quotes ""if he's not calling you, he's just not that into you"".  So there it is
Okay, I am gonna go spend some family time with the folks."

There is nothing to do that doesn't involve wearing camoflauge. All of my friends are either out of town or busy. I didn't realize how little my social life consisted of. I am going to Orlando next weekend and I think that is why it is hitting me so hard. I really really miss orlando. I am still very proud of myself for leaving.......it was time. But, I DO miss having a big group of friends with lots and lots of stuff to do. 
Also, this ""boy"" situation has me going crazy. MAFIA
Jason, the weird boy, reminds me of jerkface more and more every single day. I said to myself at first that i would really like to be just friends with him. Thinking to myself that jerkface and I would still be speaking if we had stayed JUST FRIENDS. Sadly, Jason pisses me off more and mroe everytime that I talk to him. He is just so frustrating. I even found myself in an arguement with him tonight that made me flashback to conversations I had with jerkface. My new thought is, maybe jerkface and I wouldn't have been better off just being friends. Maybe I should just steer clear of people like him totally. OH, decisions.  I mean, I still like the guy.......although I am not quite sure why. I have just decided to NOT make out with him anymore because he FREAKS out AND because I don't need to repeat my mistakes.
I think that I was just so excited to meet a boy that was showing me attention that I didn't stop to say ""maybe he isn't the one for you"". 
UGH
So, i really really really really need to move to another place where I do NOT run into people from my past. Plus, I really really really need to move somewhere and make some friends that like to do things like go drinking at bars. Not to get trashed....jsut to socialize.

All of my friends are either out of town OR they are working. BLEH
I don't want to go back to work by ANY means...but in a strange way, I will. The sooner I go to work, the sooner I get to go to DisneyWorld! Yipee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hung out with *J* last night, the boy. We watched The Family Guy! FUnniest show ever. I am pretty excited because I think that he and I are going to be able to be JUST friends now. I was at his place until about 2:30........just talking. I really do feel comfortable around him. I was a little worried because he seemed to act pretty distant after ""the incident"", but now it seems to be kinda back to normal. As normal as the weirdo can be anyways. I think that I'm back to the ""I really like him but I'm not gonna sweat it"" mentality.
I will admit that I was VERY upset because Wes, THE boy, ditched me this weekend. Okay, not ditched but STILL! He told me like two weeks ago that he couldn't wait to see me over Thanksgiving break. His car was at his house on Wed night......and Friday, I called. His dad said that he had gone to Myrtle Beach to work this weekend. MAFIA      Ya know, I'm not mad at him for going because honestly........Myrtle Beach is like his ""disney"" BUT he totally could have told me that he was going. A quick call to say ""hey, change of plans"".   MAFIA
My friend SHerry is on her way home right now. She went out of town for the holidays. I was super excited because she, my mom, and I were gonna go watch Bridget Jones tonight. Well, when I talked to Sherry.......apparently Sherric is going to the movies (Sherry + Eric). Now, we are going to see the Incredibles. My mom has no desire to see that movies so I think she is a little disappointed with me.......but we will go and see it tomorrow.   UGH
Blake is out of town.......but Teresa is HERE and working.

I must admit, I am relieved that it wasn't worse. 
First let me say....usually all of my shopping has been done in Cary while at home for the holidays. Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina is NOT the biggest of places so my mother and I usually go to Cary (Central Area of Relocated Yankees) to do all of our shopping. Cary is quite the snoody place. Seriously, a couple of years ago the town FREAKED out because they wanted to paint the taco bell a pink color......an OH when the Gypsy's shiny diner was rumored to be coming in...shit really hit the fan. Anyways, you get the point.
Today, my mom and I went to Garner to the Target. We arrived there shortly after six o'clock in the morning. Crazy, I know! (my mom promised Bojangles. Chubby girls always go for food )    They had SOOOO many sales that I was easily talked into it. It really wasn't that bad AT ALL! I mean, it was kinda crowded but NOTHING as bad as I had expected. I even heard a couple of excuse mes and I'm so sorrys.   Impressive I must say.
I got my brother the new Buffy season (17.77) PLUS I got the 4th season of dawson for the same price. Usually both are sold for AT LEAST twice that much. SO........I am quite proud of myself. 
Now, I have my parents and my brother taken care of. OOOO and my friend Sherry........now what am I going to get for my kids!
Well, I am tired........off to dream
OOOooooooooooooooo I go to Disney soon!"

I woke up early and helped my mother fix food. My brother got here around two and the four of us sat around and stuffed ourselves.

The boy, let's just call him *J*, and I have talked a few times in the last couple of days. The other night, we had a very interesting conversation almost making me want to delete his number from my phone. I called to say hello.....he was very short and said ""did you need something"". To this, I pouted and he asked why everyone took that so badly when he said that. I ACTUALLY said ""well, because you sound like an asshole when you ask that. THAT is why everyone gets so upset"" he he he    I suppose that when he makes me mad, I can be much more honest with him. Funny how that works, huh? Shouldn't honesty come with love and not hatred. Okay, that was extreme....but you get my drift. 
Anyways, he made me mad and I avoided his calls the next couple of days. THEN, he calls me last night and says ""Hey, I was just calling to see how you were doing.""  I smiled and replied ""Oh, did you need something?""  He laughed and said ""wow Valerie, why are you being so mean to me. Can't someone just call to talk?""   He of course was making fun of me but it amused me at least.
As for the other boy *W*:   I have been crushing on this boy for almost ten years now. I have no idea what it is about him, but I swear it is like a magnetic force. I know that he is home for Thanksgiving (because YES i happen to drive by his house yesterday lol)so I KNOW that he could call. Usually, I would have called by now.....but after reading that new bible of mine ""He's just not that into you"" I have decided to wait for him to call me. As much as I like him....I have put way too much effort into him over the years. I mean, he has been worth every second with him....but he is the one that is coming home. He will call me if he wants to see me. Simple as that. Wow, it would be nice to make out with someone again. It's almost been a month!   LOL
I'm pathetic!  ANyways, I am going to hang out with my brother for a while longer before he thinks of some lame excuse for why he has to leave the house. SAD DAY    It really is nice having him around sometimes.   Well, the turkey has made me go on a super long rampage so.....................""I love to eat turkey.....on Thanksgiving!"""

"event","Okay, I have found my new book to live by.  he he he   It is a book written by writers of the brilliant show Sex and the City. It is called he's just not that into you. The concept seems pretty easy and much like common sense but it is amazing what this book has taught me so far! I haven't even read the whole thing yet! I'm so siked. This miraculous book is full of important information for us single folk. Granted, things we probably have known all along but it is amazig how much more enlightening it is when it is said out loud (or on paper)  Here are some of my favorite excerpts:

""Just remember this. Every man you have ever dated who has said he doesn't want to get married or doesn't believe in marriage, or have ""issues"" with marriage, will, rest assured, someday be married. It just will never be with you. Because he's not really saying he doesn't want to get married. He's saying he doesn't want to get married to you. There is nothing wrong with wanting to get married. You shouldn't feel ashamed, needy, or ""unliberated"" for wanting that. So make sure from the start that you pick a guy who shares your views for the future, and if not, move on as quickly as you can. Big plans require big action""

Seems easy, I know. BUT IT IS BRILLIANT! I have said for years that I didn't want to get married yet, but I have always known that once I meet a guy that I WANT to spend the rest of my life with...things will just fall into place. I have always been so scared of boys that said they never wanted to married. With a particular guy (jerkface) I remember thinking that maybe I could change his mind. I plead temporary insanity but I actually did at one time contimplate the thought of marrying this idiot. Granted, it wasn't until about three years into it....but as SOON as I started thinking it...(*&%&* hit the fan. MAFIA
Anyways, this book is wonderful and I suggest every female read it! The overall feeling of this book is....stop reading into everything and making excuses for men. If you find yourself doing this, he isn't the one. Someday, when you meet the right guy, things will fall into place and there will be no wondering what certain actions meant and why he does the things he does. He will be upfront about his feelings and won't leave you in the dark....or waiting by the phone. 

GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW
and expect more words of wisdom from this book coming soon."

She asked me if I was happy to be back and then asked that dreaded question....""are you still seeing that boy""    Pain shot through my chest. I wasn't mad at her or anything, she didn't know. It just kills me because over the last four years, my mom, my dad, my brother and myself have all mentioned that quazi relationship that I was in. I would ask too!
It just surprised me the way I felt when she asked. Much like a deer in headlights (since I am back in redneckville and all)
Last night, I rented a movie called Dopamine. I remember watching the trailer for it this time last year when I worked in the learning center. I kept waiting for it to come out in theaters and I finally saw it at Blockbuster last night. It was one of those artsy fartsy movies from the Sundance film festival. It sure did have me thinking though. It was a GREAT movie. Kinda predictable.....but very deep at the same time.
It, and recent events, has brought me to the conclusion that I have been fearing for quite some time: I am another messed up girl!
I'm not being measured for one of those ""special "" white jackets that fasten in back or anything......I just realize that MAFIA has affected me a lot more than I would have liked. I never understood why jerkface was so mean, so distant from me just because some other girl hurt him...just because his family sucked. Now, I realize that the reason I didn't understand it was because I was fresh. Not sexually pervert  LOL  I had never been in love, never been in a real relationship. It's easy to be naive about love and ways of the world when you have never really put yourself out there. Now, I find myself being ""that girl"" that often times finds herself saying to herself ""Stop doing this, he is out of your life. This guy is NOT him""  UGH UGH UGH
SO, now I am tainted. All i can do is either write a script or lock myself in my room with moonshine and my guitar until I come up with the next country album hit!

People go crazy and I am really happy that she got the help that she needed. I was by myself for like a day or two....then a new lady, Virgina, started. She is a super sweet lady. I really really like her. It is super nice to have someone who is actually helping me. Like, she doesn't JUST do the cleaning....she actually wants to play with the children and THAT is a wonderful help. Well, my old coteacher came back today. Apparently, my boss had a meeting with her and told her that ""I"" said she was never in the room anyways.
Yeah.......thanks for that.
So, i asked my boss......could you have a crazy lady in the classroom? She said ""you need to be prepared to tell her everything that you think she has been doing wrong!""
What the ()&#($*@&)#$?
I NEVER wanted to get rid of the lady. She is super sweet....she just has LOTS of emotional stresses at home and I don't think she needs any more added to being one of the lead teachers for a bunch of three year olds. I thought that was the beauty in this whole thing. That she was going to cut back her hours, be a floater, and get the help she needed. NOW~ it's me as big MEANY pants. That is a role that I am not so happy playing. DAMNIT DAMNIT DAMNIT

My job~ I absolutely LOVE my job! I am not sure it is what I want to do for the rest of my life, but I sure am glad to be doing this at the moment. I was meant to work with children, of this I am sure. I was just going through picturse and realized how many freakin pictures I have taken of these children. Maybe I should buy stock in kodak!  lol

My love life~ The boy and I finally made out!  he he he   It was totally ridiculous how it happened, but it was precious and makes for an adorable story!I really really like this guy. He is so smart, he makes me laugh, he TALKS to me about his feelings......which is something I am SO not used to. We have had those delightful conversations late at night for hours and hours just talking. THIS was before anything physical even happened. I was really trying to NOT crush on him because I really thought that nothing would ever come of it. this is weird terriroty for me. It's not every day that a boy I actually like kisses me! Weird but super exciting!

Myself~ I have been quite frustrated with my friends recently. I have always known that I am a big wimp whne it comes to most things....I have recently been taken advantage because of this so my question is......how do I STOP being such a wimp!  UGH      Help me please

My future~ After a talk with ""the boy"", I got online and contacted a few locations asking them to send me information abuot the area because I was looking to relocate! Yeah, a step in the right direction. I contacted Denver Colorado, Montana, and a few places in the New England area. Nothing too serious yet.....but I am SERIUOSLY looking into changes things!  WOO HOO

I have not bought my ticket yet, but I am planning on going to Orlando the second weekend in December! I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited! I could really really use some pixie dust! And Christmas pixie dust at that!

This is all for now, but I am SERIOUSLY going to try and be better and updating AND checking friends updates............peace out"

I totally had a bonding moment with him last night and I really really sensed a make out being possible. Sadly enough, nothing happened. But we had jokingly talked about it the night before and I could have sworn I could see the wheels turning. What to do, what to do. I mean, he's a really cool guy. He's good looking, smart, funny and TOTALLY gets my dry sense of humor. not only that, he can give it right back. Everytime that I have started liking him, I was like ""oh, he's too much like jerkface"". Now, I am wondering if I am using that as a crutch. Possible, right? Yes, he shares some quality with jerkface but they are two TOTALLY different people. Yes, they are both scared of committment  HELLO>>>>>most men are!
The Wes guy, Navy boy, lives like five hours away....I keep saying ""well, it's long distance and I don't want to do that again""  HELLO!!!!!!!!!  There is nothing wrong with Wes or Jason. Not that I am going to jump either one of them. I KNOW that I like Wes. Dear god, I've liked him for almost ten years now. I never did stop thinking of him. This new guy could possibly be a friend. I need to stop overanalyzing things as I tend to do and just let things happen. He told me last night to give him a call sometime this week and that we would do lunch. 
By the way, he totally told me something last night in confidence that he has NEVER told anyone before! This could be my sign that he wants to marry me   JUST PICKIN    that he wants to just be good friends. I could always use more friends. Especially male friends. It has been so long since I had male friends. Come to think of it, all of my guy friends and I have eventually hooked up...with the exceptions of those who ended up homosexual. Oh, what to do!
On a good note, I am still loving my job! I have the cutest kids in the whole wide world I swear!
I will try to update later this week.

I think that I have found my calling though. I LOVE my job. There is nothing better than being around kids. They make me feel so young again. Granted, they take a lot of energy out of me but they crack me up on a regular basis. I can't even admit to how much film I have gone through taking pictures of them. By the way, i have THE CUTEST kids!
I have been catching up with lots of old friends that I either haven't seen or talked to in years. That has been quite interesting. I have talked to Wes (my first car date at 15 yo)  a lot here recently. He's the best! No romantic comedy or anything...but he is a good guy!   The weird guy, Jason, and I are just friends. And I think I like it that way. He's a really sweet guy and super smart so I enjoy talking to him. He just does so many things that reminds me of the past...and I can't do that to myself. He is a great friend for now though.
I went and saw my brother's band play in Raleigh last night. Jeramy, bless is heart, is going through a really tough time with his girlfriend right now. I don't know how to help him but apparently he is a true musician and taking it out in his music (with the help of beer).
Well, that's all I have for right now........I will try to do a better job keeping this thing up to date."

Well, as usual........I called and waited for them to finish whatever they were doing.......so around 8:30 I finally called and woke up Teresa. Got Jason to drive to Fuquay Varina. Teresa and I went and got ice cream and talked fora  while in the parking lot. It was a gorgeous night! Then, we farted around until Teresa said she was tired ......and Jason wanted to go home!

Okay, I am no Pamela Anderson and that's okay. I have decided to take a step back and just be friends with the guy. Who knows!

I have one child S who is going to be a HANDFUL!!!!!!!! I don't think he has ever been in school before and he and his sister are having a horrible time adjusting. He is the only kid that I really just don't know how to deal with. The rest of them may be wild, but HEY they ARE three years old!!!!!!!!!!  They are precious.

I was trying to help her get an eye last out of her eye on Friday...and I said ""Taylor, we need to put some water in it to flush out the eye lash""  She put her hands on her hips, did the head tilt and said ""that is NOT going to happen"" and walked away!

Hurricane update: my parents home town Punta Gorda got hit pretty hard. Punta Gorda is also where my grandpa lives (just a couple of hours south or Otown) Anyways, they said he probably won't have power for a couple of weeks so he is staying at his wife's kids house. TRAUMA   My dad had talked about going to pick him up so that he can stay here for a little while....but we shall see. 
All I know is that my parents have been watching the news NON STOP!!!!!! My mom says it's not necessarily because of the storm....but because that is where they grew up. Sad that it took a hurricane to get their name on the news, but that's the way the cookie crumbles. HA
And for the boy problem.....I think that I am giving up on him. He is moving at a snail's pace AND the more I hang around him, the more he reminds me of Jerkface. NOT a good trait to have.

"event","Teresa and I went to Jason's house last night. He would be ""the boy"" I keep talking about. ANYWAYS, he's so cute. He has my phone number now and he was like ""I'm sorry I didn't call you this weekend, I ended up staying out of town longer than I had planned""  I didn't realize Teresa had given him my phone number. YEAH     So, I was flirting with his CONSTANTLY! It's been a while since I have flirted with a purpose......I hope I was doing it okay. He's just so cute. He and I like the same movies, music, he has an old car and was wearing flannel pants. PRECIOUS!    He and I sat on the couch and I seriously felt my heart jump whenever we hapened to touch (though on accident). I am such a BIG dork!
Anyways, when we left........he asked us what we were doing tomorrow night. She told him that she had to work and when he looked at me,I blushed and said ""i'm not doing anything until next wed"" He asked me to write down my phone number so that he would have it!!!!!! It is looking good, but I am trying not to get my hopes up. It is exciting to have someone new to think about though!  :)
We shall see.....even if he doesn't want to make out with me like i so DESPERATELY want him to....he's a really sweet guy and maybe we can be friends.

"event","My friend Teresa has been ""seeing"" this guy for a couple of months. NOthing serious, but they have been hanging out since April. WELL>>>>>they have just kinda been ""skimming the pages"" I hope you understand Valerie lingo there. Anyways, things haven't gotten TOO physical yet. He was home ALONE the other night and asked if she wanted to come over and stay the night. Bless her heart, she was totally prepared and he suddenly started acting like my ex ""whatever"". She said she was basically trying to attack him and he kept saying ""i'm tired, I'm hot...get off of me!""   For people who date ""normal"" boys, this may seem far fetched.....but take it from me, it happens. So, teresa and I started discussing WHY we have found the two boys in the universe that doesn't want to have sex every single second of the day.
It's not that either one of us are nymphos BY ANY MEANS! Our total number of sexual partners (COMBINED even) comes nowhere close to that of a soggy cookie. BUT, we have both been in the position where we were in the mood....and turned down. All of these years, I have felt really bad for guys seeing how THEY have to be the ones to approach a girl therefore they are rejected A LOT! But, when you are brought up to believe that boys want to boof every second of the day and it is YOUR job to determine the time and place to allow it to happen......a boy saying he isn't in the mood is as shocking as when I found out taht peter pan is often played by a girl at Walt Disney World. SAD DAY SAD DAY SAD DAY
ANyways, I am just very worried for my friend and her self esteem. I know that when jerkface totally turned me down on numerous occasion, it makes you do really stupid things and start to feel really bad about yourself. and THAT isn't right. I would really hate for her to go through the same thing I did......especially if she let it continue for YEARS like I did. What was I thinkin'?

PS> I am going to make sure this new boy of mine has a libido before anything serious happens. DEAR GOD, it's TORTURE!     M.A.F.I.A."

It's a good damn thing too, my bills are starting to pile up and my little bit of savings is ALMOST gone!
What is a girl to do?!?!?!?!?!?
Anyways, I am very excited to know that I am almost employed, BUT i would still feel better if I actually had a paycheck in my hands. Once again, what is a girl to do?
Living at home hasn't been horrible, but I would like to think about moving out of my parents house in the near future. It will be okay for a couple of months TOPS though. he he he      The job that I want....if I get it, I will have the summers off! YEAH
I hung out with two of my best friends from high school the other night. Wow, they really started to get on my last nerves. It has been quite some time since I hung out with any one person for this amount of time. I guess I am used to having lots of friends that I hang out with occassionally.......not a few friends that I hang out with ALL the time. I used to be that way......I mean, don't get me wrong. I love them both. I just decided it was time for a break. 
Well, that is all for today. I am realy good about keeping this thing updated now that I don't have a job or anything. LOL LOL LOL"

"event","This morning was my ""interactive interview"". It was actually a lot of fun. I was in a small classroom of only six kids. They were all five, getting ready to go to kindergarten. What a great age! 
She asked me why I decided to work here. I went into this big long cheesy thing, I felt like Oprah. I even started to tear up. HA just kidding   I told her that even when I didn't know what I wanted to do...I knew that I LOVED children. They are so pure, honest, and willing to learn. THEN, i went into this thing about Disney world and how everyone acts like a kid once they hit the parks. Nobody thinks twice, no matter how old they are, about putting on a funny hat or getting their picture taken with an overgrown rodent in front of a fairy tale castle. 
*sigh*
.......I digress. The point is, this morning was great. I played with all six of the children at one point in time. They were doing centers. The girls warmed up to me much easier than the boys, but the boys were great too. I have a really good feeling about this job. The director said when I walked out the door ""I'll be in touch with you within the next twenty-four hours.""
Now I wait............bleh"

"event","So, I had an interview at a Learning Center in Fuquay. It was BY FAR my favorite of all the places I have looked. The interview went really well. I feel like I kept repeating myself though. I said COMMUNICATIOn like ten million times...but I DO think it is super important.
Anyways, this center has five stars (which is the best you can get) AND they are about to be nationally accredited.   YEAH, a REAL child care center!
Anyways, tomorrow I have an ""interactive interview"". I guess they want to make sure the kids don't go running for the hills when I try to play with them. I was thinking of hiding candy in my pockets! Would that be unethical? I think not
Anyways, she said that she should be able to tell me something by tomorrow afternoon.
YEAH YEAH YEAH"

"event","Okay so....i need to vent and I can't call anyone without going outside and walking around in the wilderness known as Angier North Carolina so HERE I GO, consider yourself warned.
I have no job......I am looking. I just keep getting dead ends. I keep putting too much faith into these job opportunities. I want to do preschool.....or the travel agency thing. I just know that I need to start working SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My mom keeps coming up to me every ten minutes with these random job opportunities that pop into her head. I know that she is just trying to help.....but I am feeling very down. I am about to run out of money SAD SAD DAY
I really didn't want to have to ask my parents for money but it looks like I am going to have to very very soon.  BLEH
Tomorrow, I am going to hand out my resume to basically anyone who looks at me twice. I am thinking about going to work at McDonalds or the grocery store. Which sounds better?
Paper or plastic?
OR
Would you like fries with that?"

"event","So, I am supposed to be hearing back from the child care center in Fuquay by tomorrow (which is called the learning center HA HA HA)
I went and had lunch with my friend Sherry yesterday. Then, I came home and cleaned for a while. BLEH  My room is a mess. I really don't want to make myself too comfortable here in my parents house....but I feel like I should a little bit at least just so that my ""hotel"" room isn't a total mess!
I am going to drop off resumes tomorrow. There is another ""learning center"" in HOlly Springs that sounds very promising. I am also going to drop some off at travel agencies too.....just in case.
And now, my FLORIDA update:
I talked to my friend Sarah yesterday and she told me that her and another one of my Disney friends Brian went to lunch. SHe told me that they discussed how much they missed me and they wanted me to move back (Brian left me a message telling me this already). Then, my friend Kim left me a message saying ""you will live on forever ...if only with your lingo. EVERYONE is saying SAD DAY!""
Little things like that make me wonder if I made the right decision. I know that I will feel better about my decision to leave once I get a job!!!!!!!!!!
I know that the whole JERKFACE situation is SOOOOOOOO much better. Now that I have seperated myself from the situation, I realize how stupid I was being. I honestly haven't had any desire to call or contact him in ANY way since I left. Yes, I wonder how he is doing.....but I know that it is better that I don't know.   
WHY I punished myself for so long, I will never know. 
BUT it was a learning experience I suppose... and why regret that! 
OOooooo back to cleaning AND working on my resume/reference crap.
OOOOOO, good quote good quote I heard today~~

Anyways, we went to Wilmington....which is like my Mecca. It was great. We layed out on the beach for about two hours and then we went to the aquarium! It was awesome!
I was really tired when I got home...but it was lots of fun. Also~ of all the HUNDREDS of times I have visited North carolina's east coast....I have NEVER had someoneelse drive me. That was a nice change. I have no air conditioning so I totoally understand why she offered. LOL   
SO, I am going to drop my resume off at this brand new center in Holly Springs tomorrow. It would be like twenty minutes from my parents house....in between here and Raleigh. It sounds really nice! I am also going to drop off my resume at like ten million other places as well.
I sent Brian a care package today. It has his Canadian antenna topper that he wanted so badly, a letter written on Animal Kingdom paper, and some random pictures I thought might put a smile on his face.
As for jerkface, news is He is no longer working....someone saw him out at lunch and he told them that he hasn't worked in over a week. He is no longer living in College housing....who knows what jerkface is up to. As much as I would like to know, I STILL have no desire to call or email him. YEAH ME!!!!!!!!!!!

He encouraged me to not get depressed about being stuipd, 24, unemployed and living at home with my parents. He said that I should look at my accomplishments....blah blah blah   I think my mom was scared I was going to shoot myself or something. HA HA HA
Anyways, I have a ""meeting"" with this person at a child care center in Fuquay-Varina. They are apparently desperate, Torris knows someone....and basically the job is mine if i want it. I would be in the two year old room.
YES, it's a job......not what I want to do but I need to start working. I can't afford to be jobless for much longer. Any ideas?
Should I wait for the perfect job that may not exist?
OR should I take the job, get my confidence and bank account up, and start looking for the perfect job?"

I actually was able to understand some of what they were saying too! YEAH ME!!!!!!!

My mom and I went to eat in the big town of Fuquay Varina and then we went and had ice cream at the new place in Angier (an even smaller town). There, we saw some lady that my mom works with and her little grandchildren, 4 and 2. Maybe I should work with kids. I really enjoyed myself playing with that little girl. SHe gave me like ten hugs before she left.....OH what to do.
On a happier note, my friend Teresa and I are going salsa dancing tomrrow night. It is Columbia's Independence Day! WOO HOO   We are soooooo excited about it. I will write on Sunday and update. 
AND about this boy...Teresa and I talked about him last night for a bit. I am trying to be non shalant about it BUT she told me that she thought we should do a few more ""safe dates"" first. True, it was very comfortable just being the three of us. THEN, she started talking about how she could tell that he was into me. That he talked to me a lot, touched me more than he had ever touched her, he checked me out on the way to the bathroom. That kinda thing......either way, it's exciting!
Well, my dad had band practice tonight so I better go and help him pack up."

In better news....I think I met a boy last night. Okay, so I know he was male BUT I think we really hit it off. My friend Teresa and I were watching a Ben Stiller movie the other night and I commented on how cute I think the actor is. I LOVE DORKS! She quickly said ""oh my gosh, you need to meet my friend Jason""
Well, the three of us went to dinner last night. Then, we went over to his house. He is the same age as me, he is going to school for school psychology...HELLO, right up my alley. He's adorable, he's funny, he LOVES the Chappelle show! The only thing is, he had no idea that I wanted to meet him. That was how I wanted it because I didn't want it to be weird.....but now that I THINK we hit it off......I'm not quite sure what to do. I'm not quite sure what to do next.
I was SUPER smooth though. We stopped and got beer for him after dinner on the way to his house....he didn't have enough cash so I said ""Don't worry about it, next time you can pay......and now I know where you live!""
HA HA HA
My friend said she thought he was into me too....but we shall see. I'm trying not to get too excited about it though. Maybe we will just end up being friends. Who knows? It's been quite some time since I had a real connection with any boy other than Jerkface. 
Well, even if nothing comes of it. I had a lovely time

I am SOOOOO going to try and be careful, but when it comes to matters of the heart...it is almost inevitable. I have seen him or talked to him every day this week. VERY weird thing for me. I am TOTALLY not a clingy person AT ALL! That was one of the things that I really liked about Mark. He didn't call me every day and want to konw what I was doing every waking moment of the day! THAT DRIVES ME NUTS!!!!!!!!!    NOW, he wants to talk to me and email me.....when it used to drive me crazy back in the day...then when he stopped talking to me, I missed it. Boys are so dumb!

I mean, it is REALLY nice to be able to talk to him again. I am just really scared of getting hurt again......SIGH"

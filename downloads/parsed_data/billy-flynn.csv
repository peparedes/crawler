"event","When I was reading my friend's journal a couple of minutes ago, I realized that she had managed to put into words something that's been in my head for at least a couple of months. She wrote that much like other people, she sees a division between who she thinks she is and who others thinks she is. The problem is that she is tired of people assuming that she's only the ""loud and exaggerated"" persona that they see, as opposed to the ""quiet and introspective"" persona that she rarely shows in public.

Truth is, I feel very much the same way. Ever since I got to UCSB I've been labeled as this crazy and silly theatre major, and people often overlook the quiet and reserved side of me, which much like my friend, I scarcely show in public. I am also tired of having to explain myself when I am not my usual hyperactive self... in fact, this introverted, quiet and strangely artistic side of me is much more closer to who I consider myself to be. Yes, I enjoy being random once in a while, but I want everyone to understand that this is not all I am. In her words, ""I am who I am"", and I like being spontaneous and reserved at the same time. So if I decide to turn to my more reserved side once in a while, it doesn't mean that I am bored, or upset, or in a bad mood, it just means I'm being myself. 

I like being random when I genuinely feel the need to be, not just when it's expected of me."

"event","Okay, my arm still hurts a lot, but at least I can use it to type. That's a good thing I believe. Now, what actually happened last night: as I was leaving San Mig from an amazing night with friends, I got my bike and started speeding through sand (now those of you who've tried riding a bike through sandy concrete know why that is not a very good idea) and believe it or not, my back tire gave out on me and I flew over my handle bars and landed on my right arm and my beloved iPod (the iPod's okay, no worries). The adrenaline that I built up from the accident allowed me to get back to FT okay. It was really weird because I kept noticing how breathtaking the sky was last night. I got back to my room, with this horrible pain shooting up my right arm, so I took some advil, cleaned my knee (didn't even care that I had gotten blood all over my pants) and just gave out. I slept okay, Jason woke me up (but he always does that... moron) and I woke up pretty much the same. Good thing is that my wrist doesn't hurt that much, and I can bend my arm a bit more than I could yesterday... that's a really good thing because I can now type with both hands, 

Conclusion: Not too bad, I've had worse. Just suck it up for a couple of days and I'll be okay. 

Love you guys."

"event","I just got back to my dorm after one and a half days of hanging out with my family. Wow, I had such a great time! I got to show my parents around campus and my sister got to hang out at the library for a good 5 hours! We walked around State Street where we ran into Laura and her family-- aw, good times. We had lunch there and then we walked around for some time. I made my sister buy the first two seasons of Coupling at Borders, and we looked at random furniture at Urban Outfitters. Later on in the evening we  went to dinner at the same restaurant where Laura and I had dessert on my birthday... it was okay, not as good as I was hoping it would be. We returned to our hotel room where we had Champagne to celebrate my birthday, and watched SNL's Best of Tom Hanks (not that funny).

 I'm really happy that I got see my family after all this time, they're awesome! I got some pretty awesome birthday gifts (some leather gloves, BIG FISH, and a white tie among other things). Now I have to return to the make-belief world of UCSB, and good ol' homework!

Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good day, good evening and good night!"

"event","I guess I should write and entry and tell you all about my birthday. Be warned, some of the facts will be condensed for the sake of laziness...

Well, it was amazing! It all started the 29th at about 11:30 when we started watching Reality Bites... Thirty minutes later I turned 18! I went back to my dorm where I indulged in a brief session of SNL's Best of Christopher Walken.

I woke up really late and took the longest shower I've ever taken in my life. I got my suit and went over to Laura's dorm at about 4:00, where I got some of the BEST presents I've ever had: two words (BONZAI POTATO). Then, after much ado about nothing (and I'm not talking about the play) Laura Lucas looking AMAZING and yours truly went our way to State Street.

When we got there we walked around for a while until we reached Bucatini where we had an excellent, garlic-filled dinner. After dinner, we left and since we still had more than an hour before the play started we decided to walk around. In our walk we found this amazing place ""a l'europe"" with all these awesome stores that I will never be able to afford. We continued walking in our never-ending search for the theatre (and somewhere to have dessert), when we ran in to the MOST EXTRAORDINARILY AMAZING restaurant in Santa Barbara. For the sake of secrecy i won't reveal the name of said restaurant (It's mine and YOU can't have it!). We had desert (mmmm.... creme brulee) and left running for the theatre.

The play (Stoppard's The Real Thing) was amazing... Laura was right, it reminded me of a CTC production. SO TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PLAY, SHOVE IT! (I have no idea what they were smoking, my guess is crack). Walking back to the bus stop we met the Grim Ripper and some really colorful characters, here's a brief re-enactment...


Laura and I are walking.

There's a guy peeing on the street.

Other Random Drunk Guy: Hey, what the %&#$ are you doing?!
""Pissed"" Drunk Guy: Nothing...

We walk by. Drunk people start walking behind us.

""Pissed"" Guy (to Laura): Hey it's Wilma...
                              It's not Wilma...
                              What is it?!!
We walk away.

We then took the bus back to UCSB where we could hear the roaring crowd getting drunk in IV. Once we got back to Laura's dorm we watched SNL make fun of Ashley Simpson, talked, sang in the dark, talked some more, and then I fell asleep. I don't remember a thing.

Good Times.

The End.

Birthday firsts:

First to wish me Happy Birthday: Laura Lucas
First to give me a Birthday present: Mitzi Perez
First Birthday email: Adam Jacobs
First Birthday card: Kristen Imboden

*Just thought I should add one more category!*

First person to wish me Happy Birthday before my birthday: KAREN BASKIND!"

I'm fantasy parade 
I want you to know what I think

We have no idea where we're going
Latched in life

"event","Wow. Today has been the most amazing and insane day of my life. I left 10 minutes early from History of Philosophy so I could go early to my Dramatic Arts 1 lecture... why you ask? Well, we had a ""special"" speaker coming, and by ""special"" I mean... I don't know how to phrase it... TONY KUSHNER!!! (Playwright of Angels In America, Illusion, and other awesome plays). It was by far the most surreal experience of my life. He was sitting directly in front of me (a couple of feet away) talking for 50 minutes about his work. I'm speechless.

That's not all. At eight I went to see him again, but this time it was at Campbell Hall, where he read a scene from his new play about Laura Bush, followed by an interview/discussion with actor Jeff Bridges. That was beyond amazing. It was mostly political in nature, but I couldn't care less because it was Tony Kushner and Jeff Bridges... on stage... talking... hell, they could've read a dictionary for two hours, I don't care! Besides, they had great ideas and comments so it was way worth it.

I honestly don't know what to say. This has totally reaffirmed my reasons for doing what I do!"

"event","My allergies are out of control!! A few weeks ago, I woke up and found my face all red like I have some kind of rash. It made my skin so itchy!! I so wanted to scratch it so bad!! The constant change in weather took a beating on my skin. That hasn't happen since I was a kid!! It sucked. It finally went away but then a few days ago I woke up with one swollen eye. It's like when you keep rubbing your eye until it's all dry and swollen. Only thing is that I haven't even touched it at all. My eye's not red or itchy at all. So just my lids are swollen so bad that I keep twitching my eye because it's bothersome. I hope it goes away soon. All this occurs before spring even started..I just can't wait to see what the rest of the season brings me...=T"

2. What is your most guilty pleasure?
I guess reality shows.. 

3. Have you ever seen someone die?
Hm..Not really. But did watch my grandma deteoriate when she had cancer since I saw her every week. 

4. Are you confused as to what lies ahead of you?
YES..mostly with work and all those lovely things. 

5. What was the last book you read for pleasure and would you recommend it?
I usually read romance books. Think the last one I read was called ""The Right Mr. Wrong"" by Cindi Myers. I would recommend it to a hopeless romantic who wants some fluff happily ever after type story. 

6. Name a personal hero.
I would say my sister. I like that she knows what she wants to do in life and goes after it.

7. If a person you like doesn't feel the same way, would you continue to wait for them to change their feelings?
No.

8. Do you have a favorite perfume/cologne/essential oil/scent?
I like my perfume curve and the fruity lotions. Also food too. 

9. Is there anything that made you unhappy recently?
I guess when I went to see my grandma and she was asking me about work and of course she gets the description of my job wrong cause she goes off what my mom tells her. but basically my mom had told her how i have the choice of going to school, but i'm not going...it came out like i was a total bum..i didn't go to college at all..no degree. she was asking about my sister too and i don't know what my mom said but she said the reason my sister is not in school is because the school is closed...what the hell does that mean... so i was more upset than unhappy. 

10. What do you want most in life?
Be happy. 

11. Which of the 7 Deadly Sins do you think relates to you the most & why?
I guess sloth. I get lazy a lot over many things..Total procrastinator. 

12. What advice would you give to someone who thinks their whole world is falling down around them?
When one door closes, another one will open if not several. 

13. Who is currently the most important person to you?
Besides my well being, my sister

14. What is your drug of choice?
Clarin-D 

15. If you could keep any animal for a pet, what would you keep?
A cat. 

16. Which fictional character could you most see yourself marrying?
I don't know. Nobody comes to mind.. 

17. Do you give your all in a relationship?
No.. I'm too guarded. It's hard for me to trust someone and be vulnerable. Been hurt emotionally too many times growing up. 

18. Do you have a motto?
If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. 

19. What type of friends do you like?
Ones I can talk/vent to about things and rely on. 

20. What's your favorite position to sleep in?
On my side..but I read something recently that it was bad for you..how it's better to sleep on your back..

21. Name three movies I just HAVE to see.
A Walk to Remember, Gone in 60 Seconds, Ocean's Eleven"

Natasha Bedingfield - Single

Ah yeah that's right
All you single people out there
This is for you
Yeah

I'm not waitin' around for a man to save me
(Cause I'm happy where I am)
Don't depend on a guy to validate me
(No no)
I don't need to be anyone's baby
<(Is that so hard to understand?)
No I don't need another half to make me whole

Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't

[Chorus:]
This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in reascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how Im gonna be

Ah yeah uh huh that's right

Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good
(I like who I am)
I'm not saying I don't wanna fall in love 'cause I would
I'm not gonna get hooked up just 'cause you say I should
(Can't romance on demand)
I'm gonna wait so I'm sorry if you misunderstood

[Repeat Chorus]

Everything in it's right time everything in its right place
I know I'll settle down one day
But 'til then I like it this way, it's my way
Eh I like it this way

well..if nobody has any plans the weekend of june 20-22, you are welcome to join me, my sister, and my cousins for some hiking in yosemite. we'll be doing half dome and camping over the weekend. i know the date is far away, but it will come soon enough and i for one am not looking forward to it but i'm stuck going..so if anyone wants to come and join me, it'd be more enjoyable for me..=D if there's a lot of us, we can caravan up..=D"

"event","we were late to dinner tonight. all week, my mom had been asking if i could get off early today because i guess dinner was at 6ish or something. i tried but didn't get out of work til about 520 so we left for dinner a little after 530. when i got home, i find out my sister wasn't going because she had previous plans with her friends so that sucked. it pretty much meant i wouldn't have anybody to talk to. so it'd be just me and my mom. my older cousins weren't going because there was drama between their mom and my aunt. 

dinner was in daly city and traffic sucked!! it took a while to get there. we were heading to Moonstar (http://www.moonstarbuffet.com/). it's this upscale seafood buffet. i thought we were going to a restaurant so i was surprised we ended up there. when i heard the name, i instantly recognized it because i usually see it as i'm going onto the freeway from sf. the parking sucked too!! it was super packed. probably because the surrounding area had restaurants. when we got out, it was super foggy and cold. there was mist coming down which my mom called rain.. 

i'm not much of a buffet person because i don't eat a lot and when i go out to eat, i rather have my food brought to me rather than get it myself..hehe. i figure after a long day at work, i'd like someone to bring me my food and plus i'm super klutzy, i'd probably trip and food will go flying at somebody. when we get there, the place was packed so i figure it must be a good sign that the food was good. everyone was pretty much eating and already on their 2nd or 3rd plate. so i dropped off my purse and my mom and i headed toward the food. as i'm walking to the front of the buffet, my eyes lighted up as i saw the chocolate fountain!!!! i never seen a chocolate fountain at a buffet before so i was kind of excited..hehe. but i bypassed it and made a big mental note to stop by..hehe. 

there was a lot of food. so i just took a little since i didn't want to fill up. i got some noodles, a fried scallop, the fried sushi looked interesting so i grabbed one, some veggies, a shrimp dumpling, and a corn on the cob. the food was okay. the fried sushi was actually a sushi..hehe. it wasn't bad. the scallop i could of passed on since i'm not much into seafood. i wanted to try it since i never had it fried before. it probably would of tasted better if i grabbed some sauce which i didn't. i pretty much didn't want to go looking for it since i was kinda hungry and wanted to eat. 

as i'm eating, my aunt hands me a card for the daily special. i guess for an extra two bucks, you get to try the special of the day but just once. tonight's special was shellfish i guess since my aunt said they had lobster and something else. i'm not much into seafood so i gave it to her..hehe. she came back with two of the something else...one for her and one for my mom. 

after, i stopped by the sushi station and grabbed a few rolls. i probably should of ate more food but i wanted dessert so badly..hehe. so i went over to the dessert area to browse. i ended up getting a mango type pudding and then i zeroed in on the chocolate fountain. i grabbed some strawberries and coated it. there were marshmallows too but i don't really like those except in a rice krispy treat which i took that plain. i figure the treat was sweet enough and wouldn't need the chocolate. of course the chocolate strawberries were sooo goood!! the krispy treat wasn't so great. it wasn't krispy enough. think it needed more marshmallows or maybe the real krispy treats..maybe i should of coated it in the chocolate. 

when i was done, i went back to desserts. i grabbed some jello and a strawberry pudding. i wanted some ice cream but every time i went, there wasn't anyone manning the station and i didn't want to wait. my mom had some cheesecake which i finished since she didn't want a lot of it. 

i probably could of ate more food, but i didn't feel much like getting up and navigating my way to the food. if we sat closer to the food, i probably would of gotten up. i saw bbq, seafood, soup noodles, different soups, fruits, and tons of other stuff. they even had fruity cocktails available but i'm sure those weren't unlimited...hehe. i didn't see a beverage station so i guess you had to order that and they charge you for it. my mom asked for tea for us which was fine with me..but i guess since my mom and i came late..they didn't refill our cup like they did the others which sucked. 

they had lots of birthdays there too. they'd bring out this big drum and cymbals and it made a lot of noise as they're singing happy birthday. it sounded like we were at a festival or something. 

i don't know if i'll try this place again. the food didn't wow me. it just sucked to come to dinner late and everyone pretty much ate and i felt weird trying to catch up. plus i hate eating while other people just sit and wait for us to finish. my mom had a thanksgiving thing at her work so she pretty much came to dinner full. i think i left hungry cause my stomach feels empty at the moment..hehe. but that's what i get for not getting up and getting food..=D

afterwards, my visiting aunt and uncle came home with us cause they're leaving for so cal with my parents tomorrow morning. they'll be hitting the tourist attractions like universal, disneyland, california adventure, and seaworld. think they're going to go visit my dad's cousin and my mom's friend. i didn't even know i had family down in so cal..weird.."

"event","Went to my first shark's game yesterday against the kings. i'm not much into hockey but mike kept bugging me to go so finally i just gave in cause i was tired of the badgering. aris and one of mike's friends came along. the game was okay. i had a hard time getting into it since i went to work early and i was tired. i did take a nap after work but it didn't help much. we went to eat at the chicken coop. i hadn't eaten anything all day so i was starving. i ordered a quarter chicken with the rooster bbq sauce with a side of mashed potatoes. it was good..though i don't know if it was good because of the chicken or because i was starving. my potatoes was kind of cold though so that sucked. afterwards, we walked to the pavilion. they were passing out free sharks screensavers so we each picked one up. 

already not really into hockey, i was already hesitant on going plus the fear of a puck flying up at you..mike got seats at the top so we were far away from the ice. that didn't help with my slight height phobia. it was a little scary up there. i felt a little nauseous. the only way the nausea went away was if i slouched in my seat. in the end, the sharks ended up losing. believe the score was 5-1..they're playing the kings tonight down in so cal. mike drove down today to catch that game. he's going with his gf..it's her way of making up to him for not going to a wedding.. 

long overdue, but here are jess' bday pictures..

"event","On Friday, we headed to Universal Studios. the weather was pretty nice and it was hot. it was a long walk to the gate since the parking lot was far away. we had to walk through citywalk to get to the park. it took us a while with all of us taking pictures here and there. 

when we got in, we headed towards the hulk. the coaster looked huge!! i don't really like coasters with loops so i wasn't prepared for what it was. usually when i go coasters, i have to talk myself into going on them..especially if it has loops. i prefer drops over loops. i passed on going on the ride so i just watched alden while they went on it. while they did that, we hung out at the arcade. afterwards, reese and kristina went on dr doom. i don't like things that drop either..i got my does from the tower of terror. so aris and i took alden to the storm force ride. it's like the spinning teacups. alden enjoyed it. we were spinning so fast he was sliding on the seat and he was laughing. as he was sliding he said..whhooooa!! hehe afterwads, we hit up the spiderman ride. alden couldn't go on since he was a bit short. he just missed the mark by an inch so aris and i went in first. the ride was pretty cool. i liked the ending the best. would of gone on it again if we had the time. when we got out, it was pouring rain. so much for the sunshine. when we found reese and kristina, they went on the spiderman ride while we watched alden. i stayed under the eaves so i wouldn't get wet. alden and aris went out walking since they had an umbrella. every now and then, there would be thunder. aris said when alden heard it, he stopped what he was doing and hid under the umbrella..hehe. when reese and kristina were done, it was still raining so we stopped for lunch. there was a pizza place close by so we stopped there. 

by the time we were done, the rain had stopped so we headed to the next part of the park before the rain started again. so we headed to the toon lagoon. here they had a bunch of characters like popeye, olive oyl, heathcliff, betty boop..all those good ole old school cartoons..=D the best part was that they had all these thought bubbles all around where you can stand under like you're thinking or saying them. i wanted to get as many thought bubbles but we were rushing so i just snagged the first one that fit what i was thinking...hehe. we didn't go on the water rides since it's raining. plus everyone who went on the water raft ride came out soaked!! we did stop at the quarter machines to shoot water at the riders. someone had perfect aim and nailed this one girl..she was already soaked before the ride got going..hehe. we spent a good amount of time here. there were sprinklers set up that shoot out water and alden went and ran around in it. we had a hard time getting him to leave. 

after, we headed to jurassic park. of course they had the jurassic park ride. reese and kristina went on it. aris and i passed since we didn't want to get wet. so we hung out by the drop area. aris had his camera set up to take pictures as the ride drops at the end. i went and got myself a strawberry slushi which alden seemed to enjoy more than me. in the end, i threw it away since he seemed to be getting too much sugar already. alden was pretty much bored since the park doesn't have many kid rides. so when reese and kristina finally joined us. we went and stood in line for the pteranodon flyers. when we were waiting, we saw the ride above us and was nervous because it was pretty high up and there isn't a lap belt to secure kids down. just a bar the lowers down onto the seat..kinda like those flying swing rides. reese passed on the ride but the rest of us went. the wait was an hour!! we wanted to skip it but alden really wanted to go on it so we braved the hour wait. the rain was going on and off. 

getting on the ride took forever because there were only five flyers and each flyer holds two people. when we were waiting, we were wondering about the couple in front of us. the man was much older and the wife was much younger. at first, we thought they were dad and daughter since they were with a big group of kids...but then we saw them kissing and being affectionate.. it kinda grossed us out..hehe. so we were stuck behind that for a while. the flyer was kinda scary. it takes you up and then you're going on the rail..and then the flyer starts swinging!!! good thing the ride only lasted 90 seconds. when we got off, we asked about alden's reaction. kristina said he enjoyed it til it started swinging and he got scared. it freaked kristina too and she told him to just hold on..hehe. alden was laughing when we were talking about it...hehe. 

by the time we got out, the rain was starting to come down a bit more. though we weren't sure where reese went off to but we were gonna meet up in the lost continent. on the way there, we were going to go on the flying unicorn, this roller coaster for kids..except alden had to go to the bathroom so kristina took him. only he didn't make it and had an accident so mom said no roller coaster because he did that. so we went to wait for reese at the dueling dragons. we didn't see him so aris and i went on the coaster first since the wait was five minutes. the coaster is pretty cool. it's two coasters together...one's ice and one's fire. both coasters are on their own track and at certain parts of the track, the coasters meet and it looks like you'll crash into each other. as we're walking through the line, there were some areas that were dark so i couldn't see where i was going..hehe. we decided to go on the ice coaster. on the ride, i shut my eyes. it was crazy. i spent the day talking myself to go on the coaster since i was intrigued by the double coasters. afterwards, i passed on going on the other side so aris and reese went on that one. i stayed with kristina and alden.

afterwards, we headed to seuss landing since that seems like the place where alden can go on all the rides. on the way there, it started pouring again!! we seeked shelter by the atlantis type attraction. it seemed the rain would never stop and the minutes were ticking away. finally it let up and we went there as fast as possible. 

when we got there, we hit up the dr. seuss train ride since alden has his obsession with trains.  the ride was cute. it went through this cafe type restaurant. when we got off the ride, we went into this sweet shop. they had these huge cookies that were super good. i chose a peanut butter cookie and a snickerdoodle. reese and kristina each got a cookie too. aris bought a cookie and some fudge. while kristina was making her purchase, there was a statue of the grinch in the store so we took alden and stuck him in the grinch's arms like he had him in his grip..hehe. then kristina and alden went on the fish ride. it's like the dumbo ride with fish. what kristina didn't know was that the surrounding fish occasionally spits out water at the riders so kristina mostly got wet since she sat on the outside. that was pretty funny to see her get squirted..hehe. 

afterwards, we hit the cat in the hat ride. reese opted out since he can't handle the spinning...but the ride wasn't spinning all that much. the guy who was operating the ride had tons of energy. he was whooping like he was at a club or something...alden enjoyed it because he started to do it too..hehe. the guy enjoyed it..hehe. when we got out, it was dark outside and the rain was coming down!!! we stood there for a while waiting for it to lighten up. 

finally the rain was light and we went for the entrance. we stopped at a store to see what souvenirs were worth getting and also to see the photo that they took of us. it was okay..we passed on it. aris wanted to check out citywalk. we had to go through it to get to the car anyway so why not. he wanted a shot of the hard rock. it was pretty cool. it had this disaster on the front of a car sticking out..hehe. aris has the better picture since he had me standing out in the rain for a long time to get his shots. by the time we were ready to go, the rain was starting to come down hard and thunder was happening every now and then. there was a flash of lightening once in a while. we got to the end of the citywalk and the rain was coming down HARD!! i mean you barely put a foot out and it's soaked!! so we're dashing from awning to awning to stay as try as possible. the rain wasn't letting up! everywhere we looked, there were people staying under the coverings. the halloween event was going on at universal and people were heading over there. i thought it was crazy they'd be wandering out in the rain like that. we decided to make a dash for the next covering. so we make a run for it and we made it!!! and we're all wet!!!! my socks were soaked..along with my capris. we had one more area to walk through to make it to the parking lot area. we stood there and debated whether to wait it out some more or just make another run for it. while we're talking, alden strikes up a conversation with a group that was standing next to us about the rain..hehe. then reese takes off and then the rest of us ran after him. apparently he took off first because he wanted to take a picture of all of us running in the rain...haha. when we got to the end, we were all soaked. the driest one of the bunch? it was alden..because the guy had his windbreaker on, plus a poncho, a covering from his stroller, and he was holding an umbrella. lucky guy..

we get in the car and i just feel so uncomfortable with my damp clothing. the heater was going on the car and it just makes your clothes even more uncomfortable even though it's drying. i make a comment in the car how this must be what it feels like to be in a dryer...=D 

we get back to the suite and of course everybody takes a shower washed our clothes since there was a washer and dryer in the room. for dinner, we pretty much ate as much of the leftovers since we were leaving the day after. then we kind of just chilled in the room. i had some sherbet to top off my evening and it was yummy. 

i was winding down and doing a word search and i showed aris a game on my laptop which he got hooked on. kristina comes in and he tells her about it and got her hooked on it too!! it was pretty late so kristina said she was going to turn in. we turned in a bit after she left...and then she comes back and knocks on our door saying there's something going on outside. how there are cops out there. we were like..what?!?? i think both of us leapt out of our bed to see what was going on. so the three of us were standing at the window looking out at the police activity. we saw a helicopter hovering above..and i thought they were looking for somebody. kristina said they closed off both of the side streets. we also saw police cars and one leading a truck. so we're thinking maybe they're unloading something. it was a little scary....but we turned in. we did turn on the tv in the morning hoping that maybe they'll mention it or something..but nope..nothing.

we were going to grab some breakfast before we head to the airport..but we didn't have time. our goal was to be at the airport by 1230 so we wouldn't miss our flight. we didn't want a repeat of what happened on our day of departure. when we get to the airport, we had to unload all of our bags at the check in and waited for reese to get back from returning the car. as we're standing there, i'm looking at our bags..and i'm thinking..did we really have this much with us? once reese arrived, we made sure we each had our two carryons. we got our bags on and our boarding tickets so we headed to our gate. it was around noon by then so once unloaded our bags, we took turns getting some food. there weren't many places to eat so we stopped at burger king and grabbed a quick bite. afterwards, i hooked up my laptop because aris' wanted to play the game again. so he and kristina fought over that for a while. 

we finally boarded and i tried to get some sleep. i ended up sitting in the middle. they were playing cbs shows on the tv so aris and i tuned in and caught big bang theory. it's pretty funny. alden totally passed out after we took off. when we arrived in dallas..he woke up and stretched and said...that was a good nap...hehe

we hit dallas and we grabbed some food. i was buying some chips and the cashier asked if i was from cali. i'm guessing he saw my shirt and knew..hehe. i had on an sjsu shirt on..=D he said how he should go there some time and i said he should..=)

our flight got delayed. the plane was coming from new york and the weather affected the flight there so our flight got pushed back a half hour or so. when we did get on, i was exhausted. i just wanted to crash. instead aris and i just talked...about what?? i don't know. i got the window seat so i got to see outside when we were flying. though it will be the last time i sit next to the window. i was super aware of the plane turning and i smelled chlorine for some reason which made me nausous on the flight. reese and kristina were passed out. poor alden was bored. he sat next to the window and he didn't have anybody to talk to. the hilarious part was when they came on and said to keep our seatbelt on because of the turbulance and alden said...okay!! we will!! that was so cute.. of course during the turbulance, aris had gotten up a few seconds ago to go to the bathroom and i could just imagine his reaction to the jolt of the plane..haha..but alden's response was hilarious..haha

we finally arrive back in sj around 830. we grab our luggage and aris' dad was there to pick us up. we get back to his house around 9 and we ate some dinner since we were pretty hungry. afterards, reese hooked up his camera to the tv so the grandparents can see the pictures. there were a few hilarious shots. i didn't get to see all of them because i had called my sister to come get me. if i knew he was going to hook it up, i would of delayed calling..but it was good to be home. sleep in my own bed and no bedbugs!!! don't ever stay at calypso bay if you ever visit florida. it's located in kissimmee. reese and kristina filled out the comment card and it was filled with complaints. though they did get their money back for the lousy room. so that was a plus. 

though best moments of the trip revolve around alden:
-his obsession of signs
-him calling out his mom on a safety violation that he caused.. not sure if i blogged it. but he had dropped his monorail on the floor of the car and he asked his mom to get it. so she said okay and took off her seatbelt to get it. he saw that and gasped and said ""safety violoation!!"" we all burst out laughing though i saw that coming since i heard him say it a few times over other things.. of course he dropped it again and told his mom to get it. she said no...how if she took off her seatbelt, it'd be a safety violation. so of course he goes..no mom..take off your seatbelt!!! that turns into a fit. i don't remember what they were talking about but alden just starts laughing. we're like what?? you turn and look at him and his face is streaked with tears and he has this big old smile on his face..hehe.
-got my picture with minnie...=D
-took a picture with chip and dale..those two are hard to find..=D
-find out alden won't save me when aris is hurting or strangling me.. =D

i can't wait til the next vacation...=D

"event","On Thursday, we were off to MGM. We got there pretty late again and it was hot again!! I didn't feel like moving at all. When we entered the park, the high school musical 2 parade was starting so we had to get out of the way as the float came down the street. kristina went to find out where the de la soul concert was for alden since she had to go and get tickets. so we split up since aris and i didn't really want to go see the concert. so aris and i went to ride the tower of terror first. i was really hesitant on going on this ride because i hate anything that just drops and i rode this when it first came out and i didn't like it at all.. but of course i caved in to peer pressure and got on. as we're going through the attraction, i'm silently giving myself a pep talk...i think i kept telling myself that it's okay and it's not a big deal...of course we got the front row. so as the ride is going up, i'm getting pretty nervous and when the doors open up and you see the park..i'm having a mini anxiety attack and when the ride just drops you, i let go of the bar and just grabbed onto aris' arm and i squeezed my eyes shut. it took him by surprise too cause he wasn't expecting that..haha. i don't remember the ride going up and down so much!!! i must of blocked out the first ride cause i remember the first time it was two drops. this time it was a lot!!! though i heard the drops vary every time you go on it..so i don't know..i just know it went up and down too many times. when it finally stopped, i breathed a big sigh of relief. the picture even showed me with my eyes closed shut and cringing..haha. we get off and i'm like i'm not going on that again..haha 

kristina and reese weren't out of the concert yet so we walked around. we saw stich but i didn't want to stand in line and wait..so i passed. we went on the great movie ride. they didn't change anything in the ride..was pretty much the same as before. though i think they did change the displays. afterwards, the concert was over so we went to meet up with kristina, reese, and alden. since we walked by the tower of terror again, the three of them went on the ride while i watched alden. alden was pretty upset that he can't go on the ride. so he pretty much is pouting in hs stroller and he pulls the cover over himself cause he's mad. i just let him stew in his stroller for a bit. it was getting hot sitting there and remembered that the ride exits into a store so i headed there. there's a little slope going to the store so i ran down it and it cheered alden up. he thought it was a ride cause he put his arms and started laughing and saying whee.. i found us a spot to wait and then they showed up. then we headed towards playhouse disney. alden got a picture from one of the girls from little einstien. it was still early so we stopped at the animation studio. here they showed us the stages of how characters come to life and stuff. then we went to playhouse disney. it's an interactive show for kids. everyone sits on the floor and the kids can get up and dance. alden seemed to enjoy it. he went up to the stage to dance with the other kids and when it was over..he got lost. instead of coming back down the aisle, he went all the way across the other way and walked in a big circle. i think reese or aris had to guide him back over..hehe. 

afterwards, we went to the naria attraction. i thought it was going to be some sit down show. instead they show this movie on a screen and this lady comes out and acts something..and then it's over. when you walk out, they have displays of the movie..costumes..drawings.. i'm not into narnia so i wasn't wowed by it. then we headed towards muppet 3-D. the show was cute. in the middle of the show, alden wears his glasses upside down..saying it's the best way to wear them. the right way. so he got his mom to wear them upside down. then he got me to wear them upside down since he kept talking during the show. i had to turn them back around cause i couldn't see the show. when we came out, the rain was coming down hard. i had my beach towel with me so i just draped myself in it. we had to get to the live action stunt show since it was the last showing of the day and it was getting close to showtime. we got lost going there and thought we wouldn't make it. but we did..they didn't start on time so that helped. i was worried that the show would be cancelled because it was kinda raining but it stopped right before the show started. 

the show was pretty good. stunts were very cool. best part was the finale when the car jumped the ramp and went through fire. by the time the show ended, the park was closing. it took us a while to get to the front since we were at the back of the park. as we're going to the car, alden is crying and throwing a fit because he's tired. he has this obsession with signs so when we were on the tram, he kept asking reese what every sign said. reese would tell him but he wouldn't believe it. alden would say what does that sign say...either reese or kristina would tell him and alden would say..that's not what the sign says!! but yet he kept on asking.. at one point, alden told reese how that's not what the sign said..you can't read!!! so reese said okay i can't read and alden was screaming and saying yes you can!! what does that sign say!!! man he was cranky. he was still going at it in the car. aris stuck him in and we pretty much let him cry all the way on the drive. 

when we left the park, we were all pretty hungry. kristina wanted some rice so we stopped by this chinese restaurant. we went in and grabbed a take out menu to look at. i was looking at it and i'm like this isn't the menu..and i kept saying that over and over again cause i knew there were other things that should be on the menu and wasn't...but we made our picks and went back in to place our order. i was right when i said the menu we had wasn't the right one. the lady went and grabbed the menu for us so we can take a look at it and that one had a lot more choices in it. as we're looking, the lady asks us where we were from. we said california and she asks if we were also from the phillipines. they said yeah and i said no..i'm from china. and she goes to questions me about what i speak and stuff and she starts talking in cantonese..haha. i just told her i knew a little but i can understand what she's saying. as we're waiting, there's like several tables there filled with asian high school students all wearing a uniform. we're trying to guess what their organization was but couldn't figure it out. as their leaving, we get our food and head back to the car. reese and alden were playing around with the car and reese saw the huge group of asian people leaving the restaurant and he rushes out to take a picture..haha. since that was the only time we've seen that many asian people on the trip.

we get back to the suite and we settle in and rest before eating. the dinner was good. it was probably the best meal of the trip which is pretty sad..hehe. i go all the way to florida for some chinese food...hehe. during dinner, alden wasn't listening. he didn't want to eat and was yelling and screaming. i forgot what he wanted but he was going on and on about it. plus he kept using the stools at the bar to make a bridge. he used the ones on his side and my side so it's blocking the connecting door. i was very close to calling my coworker to get him to stop since he fears her..hehe. but i didn't. i tried to get him to move the stools cause i couldn't get to my room. he was still crying and going on about how it's a bridge and he needs it for his train. i asked him how i was going to get to my room then if i can't get through. he kinda stopped like it dawned on him that yeah...she can't get to her room. so he moved it around so i can get past. i tried to move it back but he threw a big fit over it. 

after dinner, aris, kristina, and i were going to go to downtown disney to finish our shopping. we passed by the lego store and we saw a few displays made out of legos. they were pretty cool. my favorite one was the family walking their dogs. afterwards, we stopped at pooh's corner so kristina can get some stuff for her sister. we stayed here for a bit. afterwards, we stopped at the pin trading co. where i browsed for pins. i didn't see any new tigger pins for my cousin but i did find something epcot for jess. =D then we headed towards the huge disney store. it's so big you literally lose yourself in it. you don't even know where to start!! i went and browsed the nightmare before christmas section since my coworker gave me some money to get her and her son something. so i was on the phone with her for a bit asking her what she wanted since there were so many choices..hehe. i picked up a few other things for other people. i'm very proud of myself that i didn't buy anything for me..though i did buy a mickey shot glass the other day at the magic kingdom..hehe. we pretty much were there til the store closed. i went to pay for my stuff and i kept getting ushered to other registers. that took a while since there weren't many registers open and there was a line of people. by the time we left downtown, it was well after midnight. i think we got back around 1 or so. i had some sherbet before i went to sleep and it was good....

"event","animal kingdom is the best park. when we arrived at the park, baloo and his friends were in front of the entrance greeting guests. since alden has never seen jungle book, we passed them up and went into the park. we head to africa to the safari ride since we knew that was one of the main attractions. when we got there, the guy in front told us to look up into the tree because there was a hidden iguana built onto the tree. it looked really real and you can hardly see it since it blended into the branch. the line wasn't bad and before we knew it,, we were on the tram to see the animals. there were lots of interesting animals. i saw on the left side of the tram so i got a few shots. the best park was when we drove by the lions. as we came up to it, we saw the male lion standing on a cliff, just looking out and we go around the rock and there was a lioness laying on its side on the rock sleeping. the little boy in front of me asked his mom loudly if the lion was dead..haha. as we rounded the rock, the male lion just comes up over the cliff like it's stalking his prey..meaning us...that was the coolest park!! afterwardsm we got off the safari, we walked on a trail to see even more animals. that took a while since there were a few areas we lingered at since there seemed to be crowds in certain areas. 

afterwards, we stopped for some ice cream and bathroom breaks and then headed off to asia. on the walk there, you can see the tree of life. it's the tree that's in the middle of the park and the trunk and branches has all these animals carved into it. it's very cool. we spent a bit of time taking pictures of the tree and hanging out there. alden went and played the bongo drums as aris got his fill of pictures. as we start to get back on track to asia, we notice a large group of people looking at this tree area. of course we wondered what the hell are they looking at because you just see a bunch of greens...and then something starts moving off of the trees!! it's someone covered up in the matching leaves and they're on stilts and they're moving stealthily over each branch and blending into the greenery. 

finally we hit asia and since one of the main attractions was everest, we decided to get fast passes for it and come back down and do the kali rapid rides. the water ride had a height requirement and we hoped alden can get on..and he just made it!! i felt so bad for him for the other rides at the other parks. he missed it by one inch!! if we went next year, he totally could of made it on a lot more rides. when he was getting measured for the water ride, he didn't know what to do. the lady told him to get down under it so he can get measured and he got under it and started to crouch down..hehe. that was hilarious. then she tied on a bracelet to let them know he can go on and he's all...what is that!?! in that awestruck voice. then he jumps with joy out of there and says look everybody!!! with a huge grin on his face as he holds up his bracelet..hehe. he was so happy he got to go through. when we got on, aris was saying how reese was going to get the most soaked. me and kristina pretty much groaned and said he cursed us with that statement. so of course what happened!!! we got soaked!!! the first one was this poor little boy...he got drenched the first time out!! and then alden got hit from behind along with kristina..haha. and then me and aris got drenched!!! a huge wave just came up behind me and i got soaked!! the good part was that i had a thin top on so it dries pretty fast, but i had denim shorts on and that took forever!! and reese!! he didn't get a single drop on him!!! if he got wet, i didn't see it. i think aris suggested we go on again cause reese didn't get wet at all, but kristina said with our luck, it'll stay that way and the rest of us will get wet..hehe. the best part of getting soaked for aris was that you couldn't see his sweat stains from his backpack..haha. that was super gross. 

we still had some time before hitting everest so we went on another trail to see more animals. saw a kimono dragon there and didn't realize they were so big!!! and ugly!!! then we headed to everest. alden couldn't go on since he was too little. he didn't like that at all. he's a total coaster junkie. he likes the thrills. aris and i went first. the coaster was very cool. aris and i sat in the front. usually when the coaster takes you, it slowly builds that anticipation of the drop or whatever curve there is but nope!! it takes you onto the track and then it just throws you into the curves and drops!! then it stops because the track is a dead end and it pulls you backwards!! and then you're forward again waiting...til the yeti pulls the lever and shoots you down the long drop!! that was a cool ride.. i would of loved to go on it again..but didn't have time. we bought the picture of us on the coaster. it has me screaming and aris has this wide eyed look as we drop..hehe. then it was reese and kristina's turn. told them to prepare themselves for the curves since kristina gets a little motion sickness. while they were on, i went and got a frozen banana. of course i had to get the change that was wet..hehe. i forgot why i gave aris the money but he looked at me funny like why the hell is your money wet..hehe. i had to tell him that the people in front of me were soaked from the water ride. while we waited, alden was playing in the dirt. he said he was camping. the only time he stopped is when he saw my frozen banana or when goofy came by on the boat. he looooves goofy for some reason. 

afterwards, we stopped for lunch at a bbq place. the food was alrite. i ordered a bbq chicken salad. though i was expecting something different. the description had me thinking a bbq chicken with a side of salad. there wasn't much chicken in the salad and for some reason the bowl felt greasy. everybody else pretty much ordered ribs with the beans and corn muffin. alden pretty much played with his food. only kids put applesauce onto their hot dogs and call it art! 

then we hit dinoland. we thought it would be a place for alden since it looked very kid like. when we got there, there wasn't really much to do. it looked like it could of been great america. therhe were the carnival type games and i think two rides there. the only ride alden could go on was the spinning dino ride. the only cool thing i saw there was this bride made out of a dinosaur bones leading to a trial. we didn't get to explore that since the park was closing and there were a few things we still had to do. 

we headed to the 3-D bugs life show. as we walk to the auditorium, we notice that on the walls are animals and realize the attraction is pretty much inside the tree. it was very cool. we thought there would be a certain spot where you can go just to see the tree...but i guess it's pretty much part of the bug's life attraction. i've seen it at california adventures but i still like it. i knew where the nasty surprises were so i tried to avoid them if i could. of course i neglected to tell the others and let them discover them on their own..hehe. when we got out, there was a parade in progress and it blocked the exist. so we were stuck there...wasting valuable park time. we still wanted to see nemo the musical and that was way on the other side of the park. but we made!! the show was pretty cool...though all of us were really tired from all the walking. so i think we pretty much all snoozed if we could. i knew aris dozed off cause he was snoring. i had to hit him to wake him up!! alden enjoyed it though. after the show, he'd start singing...just keep swimming..just keep swimming. i loved all the puppets used for the show. the best one was crush. he was super big. he took up pretty much the entire stage. 

by the time we got out, the park was closing. we stopped one last time in front of the tree of life and had our photo taken. afterwards, we pretty much had the munchies so we stopped by a mcds. the mcds was interesting. on the roof had all these gigantic displays of their merchandise. i ordered a hot fudge sundae and aris did too. they also got the ice coffees. when we got to the window to get our orders, aris had two sundaes in his hand and one of them had the most hot fudge in it. i was staring at it and knew he was going to take that one!!! so when he started to hand back the one with the less fudge..i'm like i knew it!!!! everyone pretty much cracked up because they knew what i was talking about..haha 

we get back to the hotel to rest up since we were gonna go back to downtown disney and do some shopping. we looked around at the stores and also to look for a place to eat. alden saw a train area where kids can ride the train and he started crying cause he couldn't go on. we stopped by the rainforest cafe to put our names down and since it was a wait, we went back to the train station so he could ride it. he told his mom he wanted to sit in front because he wanted to be the conductor. but when he walked in, he headed towards the back. we're like where's he going!! and he gets into the caboose..why!?!? because that's where all the kids are. he likes to socialize..hehe. as the train goes around the track, you occasionally hear him talking to the other kids..hehe. it started to rain then so we headed back to the restaurant to wait. it seemed like forever. but finally we got seated in the elephant room. the food wasn't good but i knew that since i ate in the sf one. i ordered a penne pasta which sucked. it tasted really bland. i forgot what they ordered but it had a little bit of everything on it..like fish, some kind of meat, shrimp. the only bright spot of the meal...was my daiquri... that was like the greatest part!! i've always had some kind of drink when i'm on vacation, but florida was like the most i've ever been sober. like i said...don't ever do epcot sober..hehe. when we got out, it was still raining and the shops were closing so we didn't get to do much shopping. we stopped at a couple of stores but i didn't see anything i liked. so we said we'd come back on friday after universal and shop then. but it was a good day. we were glad it didn't rain while we were at the park. though reese did say if it did rain, it would just make the safari authentic. =D

Here are some pictures..more to come..=D

"event","when we woke up in the morning, i looked out the window and i saw some sun. i'm like yeah..sun!! no rain!!! the park opened at 9 i think but we didn't get there til around 11 which sucked. 2 hours down the drain when we could of knocked out half the park by then. 

to get to the magic kingdom, you parked and then take a tram where they drop you off at this point and you can either take the monorail or a boat to get to the park. magic kingdom is located all by its lonesome in the northern part of the park area. so we chose the monorail since alden has this thing with trains. it was cute that when we got on, they had that automated voice telling you to hold on to the rail and stuff and alden reaches out and holds on like he really was going to fly out even with him strapped into his stroller. 

when we finally get to the park, of course there is some lingering at the front where the mickey is on that grassy area. since it was halloween, the place was decked out with pumpkins and other halloween things. as we move along through the tunnel, it starts to pour.. i mean like cats and dogs. everyone was hundled under the tunnel or wherever they can seek shelter. kristina and reese bought some ponchos from walmart for a buck and they had those on them. i didn't wear them..i figure if i get wet i get wet..plus it was so humid, you weren't wet for long. 

it poured for a while and we kinda walked along the side where they had a gazebo type overhang  and slowly made our way down main street. by then, the rain was letting up and we got a few pictures of the castle..of course after we took pictures of that, it started to rain again so we couldn't get our pictures taken in front of the castle. we wanted the disney photo people to take our pictures since they put in those cute little animations on it so it looks like you're looking at something.. we didn't know it but apparently when they take your photo, they give you this photo card instead of those papers to claim your pictures later. that is so handy..instead of having this stack of papers, you get this nice little card where it holds all the pictures and you can use it in all the parks so it was super convenient. 

the castle was closed off so we couldn't even go through it to get to fantasyland. we weren't sure where we were gonna head to first but suggested hitting fantasyland while alden was still awake and figure fantasyland will be packed and have the longest wait line.  we checked out this play area  by the pooh ride and alden was very excited he kept running around. afterwards, we went and checked out mickey's philharmonic which is a 3-D show with mickey and friends. it was cute. 

we hit up peter pan next since it was right next to it. i think the entrance to the rides is cool. on top rather than a sign just stating the ride, it has a 3-D model of what the ride is. it's a small world was weird. going to disneyland so much, i'm so used to seeing the castle right out there when you get in line for it. in orlando, the castle is inside and the boats are smaller. 

by then, we were all pretty hungry, i had some chicken strip and fries. alden had his little children's meal and the plate was the shape of mickey's head. 

the pooh ride had a pretty long wait. they did provide a stroller parking in certain areas so you're not lugging the thing around all over the place so that was handy. we hit up the haunted mansion. we thought they would do a nightmare before christmas like disneyland but it wasn't. there was some differences. it was fun reading the tombstones but the one at tne end was creepy. occasionally the eyes would open up and move around and look at you. the ride had some differences, but unless you're a disneymaniac, i doubt you'd notice..=D

we were walking to another part of the park and noticed they were setting up the route for the year of a million dreams parade. since the parade was about to start soon, we sat down and decided to watch. it wasn't crowded so we sat pretty close to the curb. sitting out there, you get pretty hot and sticky. the ice cream didn't help cool you down so we just walked towards adventureland and we saw these tiki statues shooting out water and kids running around. so they let alden out to run around to cool off since he loves water. he went in and just kinda stood there until it came shooting out and then he'd run around. this one time it got him right in the face..hehe. he was pretty much soaked by the time he was done and didn't want to leave. 

he got dried off and we were on our way to pirates. the ride was pretty much the same. when we got out, alden stood in line to meet wendy and peter pan. when he got to the front, they were asking him lots of questions and he just stood there and looked at them funny..hehe. we headed to splash mountain but we saw woody and jesse so kristina and reese stood in line with alden to get a picture. we figure while they wait, aris and i would hit up splash mountain and then trade off when we got back. when we got there the wait was like 50 mintues so we went back and they were still in line. we decided to fast pass it. after we got the passes, we met up again and the fast pass time wasn't for a while so while we watched alden, kristina and reese went to get the stroller. it started to rain again!! so we went into this store that was next to us. the place was cold!! we walked around for a bit, and aris had to go show him a monorail. when his parents came back, alden goes to his dad and says..come here..let me show you what you can buy me.. i'm like great!! even kristina was like thanks aris for showing him..kristina didn't want to get it but reese ended up getting it for him since he started to throw a fit. it was still raining so we decided to pass on splash mountain. so we hopped aboard the train and it took us to toontown. we went into this character greeting place. at first i wasn't sure if we were in the right place since when you walk in, it's a store. and do you know in their stores they keep the a/c on blast!! i mean no wonder people get sick..you're hot one second and freezing cold the next!! but anyway on the right there were 2 lines to meet the characters, one was for mickey and friends the other were the princesses. we got into the mickey line since we doubt alden wanted to meet the princesses..hehe. it was a super long wait!! the line wouldn't move for a good amount of time and they said how this character was taking a break or this one was. i mean the princess line was moving faster than ours. when we finally got in, goofy actually came out and got our group and was like super hyper. alden was super excited when he saw him and couldn't wait to see him. of course we had to wait in another small in while everyone in front of us got their pictures with donald, pluto and goofy. i got a picture with donald and pluto but i passed on goofy because that goofy in there had to be on some red bull or something. that dog was jumping all over the place and he didn't stop!! when alden joined him, he jumped too and goofy jumped even more!!! afterwards, we wandered around the store a bit to see what was there. kristina and aris both bought some sweets. after leaving, aris and i hit up minnie's house since i wanted a picture of minnie. i mean i've been trying to get a picture of that mouse for the past four years. it took a long time!! but i finally got it!! while standing in line, reese and alden went on the goofy coaster which was right across. kristina joined us in line and we saw them on the coaster. they were sitting right up front and you can see alden putting his hands up and smiling..it was cute..hehe

by the time we left minnie's house, alden was out like a light in his stroller. so we headed towards tomorrowland to get fast passes for space mountain. reese and kristina took alden somewhere dry while aris and i went to get the passes. we met up at a nearby cafe. reese and kristina were eating some bbq and alden was still sleeping. we made a bathroom stop and then we went to space mountain. the interior isn't as cool as disneyland but the ride was good. it had all these  aris dropped off his stuff and went off in search of his damn turkey leg which i think is gross. it was getting closer to 8 and alden was still sleeping. we still had a few attractions to see before leaving since the park closes at 9. he finally woke up and we went and hit up stitch's great escape. this was a little creepy. if you've even gone on alien encounters, it's like that but for kids. but since we didn't know what to expect, it was a little scary. they had these restraints that came down on you but it hurt cause it said it would stop once it hit your shoulders but it didn't, it just kept on going. plus most of the time, it would be pitch black in there and you had stitch running around you, literally breathing down your neck. plus he jumped on the restraint which hurt!! alden actually said ""ouch."" 

afterwards, we hit up mike's laugh floor which was cool. it's an improv done by the monsters and mike is the host. the monsters actually use the audience to tell their jokes..it was pretty funny. some people were into it and joined in with whatever the joke was. the guy who they chose for mike didn't react and that was hilarious. the monster kept saying about how mike only had one eye..and the guy just sat there..didn't participate.. the monster even tried to tell him to cover his eye and he didn't...=) we wanted to hit up buzz lightyear before we left but the place was closing. the fireworks were going to start so we found a spot. didn't have to go far since the castle was close by. aris found his spot in the corner to photograph his stuff. he and the guy next to him had their cameras all ready to go. the fireworks were late and thought they had cancelled them since it was kind of windy. but it went off. after the fireworks, we stopped by the castle to take some pictures by it. then we went to main street and did some shopping. i bought a few shot glasses and saw this figurine that i went and bought for my cousin since she was getting married next year. so i'll be holding on to that for a while..hehe. so off we went back to our car by the monorail. alden held on for dear life again when the lady said to hold on..hehe. i think we got back to the timeshare around midnight and went to sleep around 2."

"event","i woke up before everybody else. the temperature was humid even with the fan going. so i got ready for the day. i thought we'd hit the parks but nope..they decided to take a chill day which i thought was weird. usually i take my chill day the last day i'm there. =D

we had to go to walmart and stock up the kitchen. it took us some time to head out the door but we hit ihop for breakfast. i ordered a simple eggs, hash browns, and sausages platter with some apple juice. 

afterwards, we went to the outlets to do some shopping. i didn't bring my store cards so just had my one card. i didn't want to buy a lot since my suitcase can't really fit much and still had to bring home souvenirs..so i just ended up buying a hooded sweatshirt from gap. the guys ended up going to the nike outlet so me, kristina, and aldne went to hang out by the fountain. alden has this thing with fountains and tracks. every time we pass my something track related, he has to point it out. plus he has this thing about littering and garbage. he saw a piece of garbage on the floor and he picked it up. kristina was irritated that he kept doing that because it's really dirty. he went and actually picked up this wooden thing that separates the tanbark from the concrete. he's not my kid so to me it's kinda funny....hehe

finally we head on over to walmart. it's a superstore so it's like a walmart and a grocery store combined. we spent a few hours here. i went looking for some allergy medicine and i walked through the whole store only to find out the pharmacy was right next to the entrance. we got drinks, sandwich makings, frozen foods, and snacks. afterwards, we headed toward sonics since they had one in the store. i ordered a lemon berry slush which was good. we head back to unload our groceries and i stuck my drink in the fridge for later. 

after we took everything out, alden was going to go swimming and the rest of them were going too. since i don't like swimming and i didn't bring a suit..i was gonna take a nap since i didn't get much sleep. i was so exhausted that i just laid on the bed and was out. i didn't even notice alden come in asking us if we were going. apparently he seemed real disappointed that me and aris weren't gonna go. he asked him who was gonna go with him and he didn't seem all that excited his parents were going to take him..haha. aris was going to go but looking outside it was super windy so he passed. 

i woke up later and alden and his parents were back in their room sleeping and resting. though i could hear alden. he was by himself so aris went and got him to hang out with us. we had the tv on and was watching shows and tuned into 101 dalmatians and he was hooked. that kept him occupied for a while. afterwards, he headed out since his dad was in our kitchen. i went after him cause i wanted my drink and when i enter the kitchen..i see the little sneak drinking my drink!! apparently his dad had our fridge open and he saw the drink and asked for it and he gave it to him!! i'm like that's my drink!! of course he kept on drinking it like he owned the drink.

we were gonna hit downtown disney but i already showered since i didn't get confirmation on going. i could of gotten dressed but kristina said i already changed so just to stay put. so we had dinner which kinda sucked. it was just some frozen lasagna that we got at the store and we're like this is the saddest meal..we're like where's the garlic bread? the salad? hehe

reese and aris decided to catch the kingdom at some movie theatre close by. i decided to stay home with kristina and alden since the premiere for desperate housewives and brothers and sisters was going to air. 

later we get a call from the guys saying how they ended up in downtown disney instead of the theatre so they caught the movie there. aris said we should of went downtown earlier because common, qtip, and one other one that was performing at the house of blues. so aris got to meet them as they were coming out of their performance. the guys ended up going to pleasure island to grab some drinks and met some girls out celebrating a birthday. they were from somewhere down south since the girl had an accent. aris said it was super weird to hear a korean chick with a southern accent. the girls couldn't believe the guys were from california until aris pulled out his cannibus card...lol

after the shows ended, i was getting tired so i was gonna turn in. i remembered we had some clothes in the dryer so i went to grab them. the dryer is next to the connecting door behind a sliding door so i had to close the connecting door to get to the dryer so as i grab the clothes and i go to close the door, i let out a small scream because kristina was standing there behind the door. she jumped too since i apparently scared her as i moved around. she thought someone had come in. we had a good laugh about it but what do you expect with just girls staying by themselves..=D

the guys came back and aris said the movie was intense. people were crying when they walked out of the theatre. that's why i passed on the movie. it looks good...but i'm on vacation..i don't need any intensity..i'm there to relax and enjoy myself before heading back to reality.."

"event","Day 1: Departure

so friday before i left, i crammed all the last minute things into the suitcase..made sure i had enough clothes in my bag where i finally went to sleep at 1 in the morning. i set my alarm for 6 since we were going to meet up at 7 and head on to the airport. instead i woke up at 5 and laid around for a bit before getting up at 6. i thought i'd be tired since i'm not much of a morning person and thought i would laid around procrastinating, but nope..was wide awake. guess i was more excited on going on this trip than i thought. i ended up sleeping in the clothes i was going to travel in figuring i would have a hard time getting up. i was deciding whether or not to bring my laptop with me. i figure i can upload my pictures so i would have more space on my cards. i talked to aris' a bit and find out he's still in santa cruz and he's packing at the moment. i'm like okay..are you going to be on time since i think it was around 630 when i talked to him. he said to just bring it cause apparently he needs it to do his homework or something. but i think it's just an excuse for him to play with it. so finally i go to wake up my sister so she can take me to aris' sister's house so we could all head out. it was still a little dark and nobody was up yet at my house except my cousin who was moving around in his room. i'm sure i made some noise lugging down my suitcase. 

on the way there, i wondered if i'd run into my boss at the airport because she was flying out with her husband's family to attend a wedding in hawaii. since her airline is right next to ours, i figure we'd run into each other. i get to aris' house and nobody's answering the door. i figure they're either still sleeping or in the shower. good thing his mom pulled into the driveway or i would of been standing in the cold for a long time. since i was ready, she loaded up my suitcase in first and we went in. kristina was in the shower and alden was still sleeping with grandpa. i didn't see reese anywhere so thought he was still sleeping. i hung around and watched some tv. aris' dad woke up so i went in to see alden. he was starting to wake up and he looked up at me with this weird look like..""what are you doing here?"" since he's used to seeing me at work. he goes to the preschool there and sees me there all the time. but i just asked for a hug which he gave me before i put him down and he went and hugged his mom. 

i waited around while the rest of them got ready and reese walks in with his bags. aris still hasn't shown up so wonder where he was. figure he was somewhere on 17..when i called him he said something about getting gas. i'm not sure when aris got there but i'm sure it was some time between 730-8. they were loading up the suv since their parents were taking us to the airport. reese was trying to get alden to brush his teeth so he told him to get on the toilet to do it, but he wouldn't. i was standing at the door watching when finally i pretty much yelled at him to get on the toilet and he did it..lol. 

finally we were off to the airport around 8 which i think was cutting it close since our flight leaves at 855 but then kristina said she forgot the stroller so we had to turn back around to get it. we weren't that far off but it was cutting it close. i think we finally arrived at the airport a little before 830. i was feeling a little nervous that we'd miss our flight since we had to go through security and the line was long. we checked ourselves in. since i just had to check myself in, it went by quickly while they had to check the four of them in with their bags. kristina said to just go stand in line and they'll join us. the line reached all the way to the parking lot and i'm thinking..there's no way i'm going to make my plane.. i get halfway through the line before they show up and kristina tells me how they missed getting on the plane by one minute since they didn't check in in time so they'll have to catch the next flight which was at 1010 i think. i remember when she told me that, i think i pretty much freaked out but i hid it well. i looked at aris and he kind of turned away because he knew how i was really feeling and could tell i was freaking out. i hate planes and it was bad enough i had to get on one to go on this trip, but it's worse when you're doing it alone.. but i said okay and that i'll just see them in orlando. what else can i do?? i'm on the plane and they're not..

so i get through security and practically run to catch my plane. i find out they were holding the plane for me and everybody was waiting for me. i kinda felt a little embarassed that i was holding the plane up, but it wasn't my fault!! i was ready to go at 5. 

i get to my seat and the guy who sits next to me is sitting in my seat but he moved over and we talked for a bit. he's going home to lubbock or luddock to see his family and he said how that place really has nothing. there's some country song about the place how you're looking in the rearview mirror at the place cause you're not going back... 

i hate takeoff. i hate the feeling and once we get up in the air, it was good. i pulled out my ipod and my word search and did a few of those. then we hit turbulance!! and i'm like oh my god. i think i pretty much held my breath when that happened. i think while i was on the plane, i pretty much had to talk myself down not to hyperventilate or something. i pretty much had to convince myself that i wasn't on a plane. 

i get to dallas since that's my stop and check my phone. aris left a message apologizing for missing the plane and stuff. since they were up in the air, i left one saying i'm in dallas at the moment and to call me when he can. i had about an hour before i had to catch my flight so i went and grabbed some lunch. just ordered a salad since i wasn't all that hungry cause of nerves and didn't want anything heavy. while i ate, i called linda and told her what happened..along with wishing her fiance a happy birthday. talking to her helped. we had a few laughs and she pretty much said she's gonna yell at aris for letting me go on alone...hehe. 

the hour flew by fast so i headed towards my gate and aris calls and their plane just landed and was pulling up to the gate while i was getting onto mine. so we basically missed each other. he apologized again and said he knew i was freaking out too cause he saw the look on my face. he said he gave his sister a hard time about it. since she doesn't know about all my phobias she was clueless. so aris basically told her how bad he felt and she didn't get it. so he told her how i pretty much was freaking out cause i don't like flying or heights. he basically made her feel bad about it since they pretty much missed the flight because she had to get the stroller..which we were glad she did..it came in handy for the little guy. 

i get onto the flight and had the middle seat which i didn't much like. on the first plane i had the aisle. in the middle of the flight, i had this sudden urge to go to the bathroom since i had downed a whole bottle of water with my salad before getting on the plane which was pretty stupid. didn't help that i was also sipping on some orange juice at the time. i didn't want to get up and go since the lady next to me was sleeping and i'm a bit claustrophobic and i didn't want to get in that little room. i held it in as long as i could, but i couldn't do it anymore. good thing the lady next to me woke up. so i get there and get ready to go..only thing was i couldn't go!!! i guess i had stage fright from going up in the plane. i tried, but i said screw it. i can't...hehe. but i didn't have an urge to pee anymore ..hehe. 

the flight got in a bit earlier than scheduled. i think around 705 so headed towards baggage claim. it took forever for it to come down the belt that i just went to the bathroom since i really had to go pee. i did.. guess i felt better on the ground. of course the bags still weren't on there yet. i think i waited for over an hour for my bag. didn't mind much since i was still waiting for the other plane to get in. i grabbed my bag and found a bench to sit on to wait. i called and left a message for aris telling them i was waiting in baggage for them and to call me when their flight gets in. the wait felt like forever and i kept getting up to look at the screen to see if their flight was in yet or not. i figure their flight had to come in earlier like mine which it did. while i was waiting, i pretty much was staring off into space because i was tired and wanted a nap. aris finally calls and says they're here and they're headed our way. so while i was waiting, this older man comes up to me and asked if i was okay..i'm like yeah..i'm just waiting for my friends. he's like oh okay..i'm just making sure you're not one of those lost children.. i'm like laughing and saying okay..i'm okay..hehe. he was waiting for his wife to come out of the bathroom. after they leave, i'm still chuckling over that and thinking..do i look that young.. i took down at my clothes and figure i guess so since i'm pretty much dressed like a college student..but still..lost children?!??

when they arrived, i saw aris and alden first since kristina and reese went to get the luggage. later, i asked aris if alden noticed i was missing and he said he did. he asked where i was and aris explained how i checked in first so i was going to go ahead first. and with 3 year old logic, he says oh..she's on the teacher plane?? lol i don't know what aris told him but that was funny. and then when they arrived and he saw me, he asked...why is she here? lol the guy forgot i was on the trip already!!

we had a hard time finding the car rental place. we followed the signs and got to the check in counter but couldn't figure out where to go to get the car. it took a while to get we were suppose to go outside and cross the street to the parking garage to get it. the minute we walked out, we felt the heat already. we get to the garage..only to find out the escalator and the elevator wasn't working and the rental place was on the second floor. there was no way we were gonna haul up 10+ bags up some stairs along with a stroller and car seat.. so kristina and i were gonna wait downstairs with alden while the guys went up. while we were waiting, i took off my sweater and changed into flip flops. everybody who came by, we had to tell them the elevator wasn't working and that there was on on the other side of the parking garage like the lady told us before. kristina was wondering why they don't just stick a sign up there that said out of order. i couldn't figure out why either since the lady wasn't really doing her job in informing people it was broken. i mean alden was the one who told people it was broken and told them there was one on the other side. it was pretty comical to hear a 3 year old telling everyone it was broken. it was getting pretty embarassing after awhile..hehe. 

when they got the car, we couldn't get all the luggage up there..so aris came back and helped us bring everything back across the street to the airport to get to the upper level where reese was waiting for the car. then finally we were on our way to the timeshare we were staying at. of course we ran into those damn tolls. there's like a few on every stretch of highway there. going there, they had people at the tolls so we didn't have to worry about throwing quarters into a bin to let us through. i think we finally found the place around 10. it was humid and i just wanted to get out of my long pants and into some shorts. 

the place looked nice. of course we had to bring up all the luggage to the second floor. that took some doing. i'm not the most coordinated person so to have a backpack on with my laptop at my side and a pulling suitcase was hard. i'm sure i was holding on to something else too..but we made it. we had a suite. kristina, reese, and alden stayed on one side and me and aris stayed in the other. the place looked nice. when you walk in, the kitchen is to your left and the living type room is in front of you. on the right is a little balconey patio area with a little table that you can sit at. the place had tvs, dvd player, stereo system, and a computer in each suite. the bedroom was in the back with a bathroom. the bathtub had jets in it so that was cool..though the bathroom in kristina's side was much better. not only did they have the jets in the tub, but they also had a separate room for their shower which i thought was cool!! 

i think we all finally went to sleep around 2-3."

"event","yesterday my aunt and uncle came over from shanghai. i just got back from florida saturday night and sunday morning, my mom knocks on my door and says we're going...so i had to drag my tired self out of bed and go to sfo. we went to my aunt anna's house first to pick up her and uncle so we can go together. linda and family were already at the airport a little before noon while the rest of us left around 1230. since she lives pretty close to the airport it didn't take us long to get there. i didn't have my cell phone on me since i left it at aris' house the night before. so i'm thinking it's ringing off the hook cause i have a family thing going on and usually it does go off a lot when we have family event. aris' said it went off all morning..hehe. 

we finally get to the airport and when we got there..didn't see linda or anybody. was going to call them on my mom's cell when my aunt spotted them so i hung up and snuck up on them. i jumped right next to linda and scared the crap out of her..haha. they were all watching the monitor waiting for our aunt and uncle to come out. their mom was waiting behind the rope at the gate. the rest of us watching the monitor were trying to guess who it was since we don't know what she looks like. their mom said she's a cross between our small auntie and our uncle. we'd point out several woman but since she was alone or looked young, it couldn't possibly be her. i remember we kept watching the screen until this one lady walked out and all of us just pointed and sayd..""that one."" she came out and we were right. it was her. when i saw her, i thought she looked like linda's mom while they said she looked like small auntie and uncle combined. i forgot my camera to take pictures of the reunion, but linda and clifford had theirs so they were clicking away. 

afterwards, we went to milbrae for lunch. my mom brought her van so all the adults went over there while us kids sat in linda's van. i brought my laptop along so they can see pictures from my trip. linda commented on how her mom didn't like the way she wore her hair cause she thinks it's ugly. before our aunt came over, we were told how we had to be nice and polite. but we said that our aunt has to love us no matter what since we're family and she should know who we are..not the fake us. we were going to eat at fat wong's..but it was super crowded and it was close to 2 and we were all starving..me especially since i didn't eat anything for breakfast. we left and ended up at the kitchen. we ate there before for chinese new year. we walked in and noticed these flat screen tvs on the wall and saw the niner game was on. we're like alrite!! but then we find out we're sitting in the corner!!! my cousins and i were angling for the outside of the table so we can see the tv which we got. the food was good..though i didn't get my egg tarts that i like. 

afterwards we headed back to aunt anna's house. on the way there, linda said she wanted ice cream and i did too. linda told her brother to drive to safeway so we can grab some. not sure if clifford didn't hear us or was confused of what we wanted..but me and linda started saying ""we're going to safeway"" over and over again like the voice in his head is telling him to go. we kept going on and on that sandra was said ""you're missing the exit!!"" so he had to cut across two lanes to get to the exit. and linda said ""see..it's working!!"" lol.. clifford was like if you want me to go to safeway just say so.. so i just yelled out..i want to go to safeway!! since my mom was driving the other van, we knew she was slow. so when we got to the light we were going to hit up the store, but then we see my mom's van pull up behind us..we told clifford he drove too slow. we were going to head to the store anyway so we headed straight rather than turn and we see our aunt anna point at us and wondered where we were going. i think we went up two more streets before we realized how we had the luggage and we had to go back to unload it so they can get settled. so we ended up not getting any ice cream..=T 

small auntie and grandpa were at the house waiting for us. when we got there, we heard all this noise outside and wondered what it was. my cousin said it was fleet week and it was pretty cool how you can hear it so clearly. sandra said how aunt anna showed her where to go to watch them...which we didn't see we had to go up to the house while our new aunt was here. our new aunt and uncle went to see grandpa and when we went up there, we saw him smiling. he's usually a big old grump and to see him smiling was priceless. i'm guessing seeing his daughter again would have him smiling. we stayed a bit and finished watching the game and they finished looking at my pictures. 

thought we were going to have dinner but since they were tired and jetlagged.. they were gonna rest instead. so we headed home and i had to call my sister to tell her not to come to sf after work. 

it was a long weekend and i was exhausted from lack of sleep. didn't help i had to be at work at 730 for an inservice. i got home, took a bath and just crashed til dinnertime.. i'm still a bit sleepy. i will write about orlando soon and post pictures. =)"

"event","i wish i had a bag for my laptop. aris got me one for my bday but it's too big and i don't want to carry around a pink bag. i am not that girly. but the more i think about it, i kind of want to use it. it makes carrying my laptop easier. i was going to stick it in my backpack..but it takes up a lot of room and i don't want it to get scratched up. my camera will be in my backpack also. it also leaves me room to bring home some souvenirs.. i don't know..the laptop bag is for a 17' while mine is 15'..

i went and bought some candy for the trip and also a book of word searches. i'm not into sudoku since me and numbers don't get along really well."

"event","i was soo mad today.. i messed up my manicure opening a bunch of boxes. the person who usually does it wasn't here today so i got assigned the job. i tried to be real careful..but about five nails got scratched up. arrgh..i figure i can go back and have the lady redo them which will cost me about 10 bucks or take off the polish and do it myself..of course if i did it myself, it wouldn't look as good as before...plus i don't have a car.. 

i somehow ended up kicking my toe on one of my bathroom cabinets so one of my toenails has a nick on it too.. this is why i don't like getting my nails done way ahead in advance.. they get mixed up. but of course when i told my sister i needed her to take friday off so i can get stuff done...does she listen...of course not!!!"

"event","orlando is just around the corner. can't wait!! though the weather there sucks! supposedly thunderstorms and it's late 70s mid 80s over there. so of course humid. not sure how to pack. so far all i got are capris and shorts in there...and socks.

work was simple. i did my lessons and then a lunch and breaks. my afternoon i was pretty much in the office since the boss was out getting stuff for our classrooms and our asst was off for the day. she got back in time for me to go. 

today did some errands. went to the mall on my lunch to exchange some things and bought a few things. i was on my way back when one of those people at the kiosks stops me and shows me this nail kit. it was just weird to have some european guy show me what's wrong with my nails. so of course i got back to work late..but nobody noticed.

after work, i went and got my nails done at this new place. i saw it when they first opened up but never tried it. told my coworker about it since she gets her nails done regularly. she tried it out and loved it. so finally went and did it since she said they charge less than my place. i was just gonna get a french pedi with flowers like usual but she really wanted to clean up my nails so agreed to a mani. just got a clear coat on my fingers. the place was empty. understandable since it's a monday. i messed up one of my nails as they were drying so she had to do it again. and then as i tried to put my sandal back on, i mess up one of the flowers on my toes so she had to do it over again. i felt so bad but she was real nice about it. 

afterwards, went to target to get some things for my trip. on the way to the cashier, i run into a parent and a kid there..said hi..and then a few seconds later..i see jenny coming the opposite way too..hehe. when you don't expect to see anyone, you see people...hehe."

"event","i had that mac and cheese craving for majority of the weekend and there wasn't anywhere close for me to get some. i really wanted the fried mac n cheese.. my sister went to in n out last night and asked if i wanted anything.. trying to rid the craving, i had her bring me back some animal style fries.. that helped a bit cause there was cheese on it..but didn't help.

so today i just went to kfc to try to get rid of the craving and it helped a bit more but i don't recommend getting that..it wasn't good. maybe the craving will go away when i have a different craving to take its place..

on another note, i heard about that jet crashing over in thailand..for my piece of mind..jess is safe...right?"

"event","lately at work, they've been cutting hours since there are hardly any kids there. usually the new school year has us pretty busy, but this year it's pretty slow. only the rooms that are 2 and younger have been full. the older ones are pretty much low. it sucks..especially when you don't have a car. they give two hour lunches and i'm pretty much stuck there when that happens. sometimes i do call my sister to have her come pick me up so i can spend my lunch in peace. though walking back to work sucks..once you're home, don't wanna go back to work. i rather leave early which i've been doing for the past three days. tomorrow i have to go in earlier since a couple of the girls aren't there tomorrow so have to fill in for one of them. hopefully i'll actually work a full day..."

"event","work was so hard today. i was in the school age room for the last half of the day and the last half hour was the worse. we were outside and something happened with a few of the kids and then next thing i know i hear some kid imitating an asian dialect. i turned around and it's the same kid i talked to earlier in the day about that. so i had to go get him and sit him down. i was a bit upset over that. i pretty much got on his case for doing that and trying to find out what happened since he said the other kid started it. it took a loong time for him to finally tell me and it did seem the other kid said something first to start it. so i had to talk to each kid that was involved individually about how it's not okay to go talking about that. how it's a sensitive subject and all that stuff. the one i talked to first i felt bad for him cause i can kind of see where he got his attitude from which wasn't good. i hope this doesn't occur again. i did tell one of the teachers what happened so have to tell the other one tomorrow. 

i just couldn't believe the things that were coming out of their mouths. it shocked me. i have an idea where it probably comes from.. but still to hear someone just say it so casually was shocking. i've only been really upset at work a couple of times..but this one beats it all.."

"event","i hate it when there are family events and you know nothing about them!! and you're expected to go..like we have no plans!! i am not going to organize my schedule around my family!!!  

my cousin's finally moving in tomorrow, the day before school starts. you figure the guy would come during the weekend to get situated...but guess not. so the internet isn't set up for him since i had no idea he was coming this week and assumed school starts next week. i hope he brings his own laptop...cause i am not sharing mine. he can use the desktop if he wants..but i watch tv here so i hope he's a multitasker..=P 

found out my aunt and uncle are coming sept 7. there was some confusion cause my aunt told my cousins she was coming in oct and my mom told us she was coming in sept. finally figured it out that she was spending a month here and a month =there to see where she likes best. so a month in sj, month in hayward, and a month in sf. i'm like where are we going to put all these people!!! we have a cousin, aunt and uncle!! my mom said she'll just have my cousin sleep in the family room on the sofa bed which sucks cause there's no door so you hear everything. i hope he's not a light sleeper. otherwise..bring a sleeping bag and camp out in one of the rooms upstairs. 

a few days ago, my mom asked my sister about saturday if she worked early which she does. but she doesn't say why.. then she comes in now and asks why my sister told her she worked the early shift for tomorrow when she worked closing. my sister was like you asked about saturday not wednesday. dad asks about wedneday..not you.. they argued about it for a while..of course i jumped in the mix because i was there too so i know both of us didn't hear wrong. then she goes and asks my sister if she can take off early. my sister pretty much exploded and said no..how she can't just up and leave her job..apparently it's our grandma's birthday and we're going out to dinner. how are we suppose to know that when her bday isn't a constant day. i can't read the lunar calender!!! 

then i find out through my cousin that we're celebrating our grandpa's bday on sunday!! it's a potluck dinner at my aunt's house in sf. i was at their house on sunday and they mentioned how we were gonna celebrate his bday with our aunt coming over with one big dinner. but i think their mom wanted to do that...kill 2 birds with one stone type of thing. i kinda hate that..lumping events together. it's not special... after that whole work thing with my sister, my mom asks what time she was working on sunday and she said no..because i knew when i found out about the potluck, she said she was working.. she either ignored me and didn't hear the question or she forgot since she has no consistent schedule. 

i wanna make a dessert for the potluck. might make some oatmeal cranberry cookies that are in the freezer. or maybe an appetizer but i don't know what. any other ideas that are easy and quick?"

"event","okay...this weekend has to be the most bizarre ever. on friday, i went out to dinner at rock bottom with a few of my coworkers. dinner got pushed back a bit since our summer picnic was that day and we stayed behind to clean up. we get there and we order some drinks. i ordered a grasshopper. on the rocks. it tasted good. if you like mint shakes..you'd like it too. the color even looks like mint ice cream. =D

but anywayz...we placed our drink orders and we're sitting around talking. me and one of my coworkers were staring at the other girl because she looked like she was going to pass out. her eyes kept on closing and it looked like she was fighting to keep them open. plus she was staring out into the crowd rather than at us. since we had the corner booth, you either had to look at the people in the booth or into the crowd at the restaurant. 

me and the other girl were talking about it when finally i just called her name and she kinda snapped up and looked over at us. i asked if she was okay and she said she was.. our drinks arrived and we toasted and took a sip except her. she got up and stumbled out of the booth. i heard her ask our waiter where the restroom was so i thought that was where she went. the rest of us continued our conversation and enjoying our drinks. after a while, i noticed she didn't come back so one of the girls went to check on her in the bathroom. she comes back and says the bathroom is empty. one of the other girls rushes out to check around the plaza since they room together. figuring maybe she went home or something. our food arrives and  it's kinda getting cold cause we're worried about her. the girl comes back and says she's not at the apartment. she decides to walk around the plaza again. one of the other girls decides to join her while me and the other one stay behind in case she comes back and plus they don't think we skipped out on the check. while we're waiting, i manage to finish my drink so i ordered another one. with all this going on...i need another one..hehe.

after a while, one of the girls comes back and says they found her. the other one took her home. it turns out they went back to the apartment to get the girl's car since they live across the street. as they're in the car, they wonder when they should flag a cop down to help them out. finally they see one and they flag him down. they give him a description of the girl and he goes...a pretty girl? they're like yeah yeah yeah! he says he'll drive around and if he sees her..he'll call them so he gets their number and takes off. not a minute passes by before the cop calls back and says he found her. he says she's sitting on a bench with a rug and a basket of napkins.. as they're driving over there, they're like no way..that can't be her...she wouldn't be holding a rug or a basket...but when they get there..turns out she was holding a rug and a basket of napkins. one of the girls said she wouldn't have believed it had she not seen it. they're asking her questions about where she went and what happened..but she couldn't give a straight answer. think the cop asked her if she told us that she wasn't coming back..but don't think she answered that either. finally they ask her if she wanted to come back to dinner or go home and she said..whatever you want..one of the girls just said to take her home..

so while the girl was doing that, we're sitting at the table pretty much dumbfounded. we couldn't believe that happened. of course as it settles in..we're pretty much laughing..because it's kinda hilarious. the other girl finally arrives and we're pretty much talking it over. as we're talking about it i thought she went to marshalls to get all that stuff...turned out she went to tj max which is like across the street.. that's a far walk.. the whole night just was weird. the waiter kept coming over and asking if we were alright. we told him about losing our friend and as we're leaving we tell him we found her and how she went shopping..hehe.

on saturday...hung out with alan. went to see some harry potter since we hadn't seen it yet. we went to the new amc in cupertino. it's not as big as i thought it would be. the movie was okay. was hoping for more fighting. i didn't even recognize dudley in the beginning til they were in the tunnel. he turned out to be some kinda thug..hehe. it was a long movie..my knees were killing me!!

afterwards, we had dinner at tgifridays since it's right next to it. dinner was good. i tried the new strawberry chicken salad they had. it was good. afterwards as we're going home, this cop car comes onto the freeway and just starts weaving back and forth between all the lanes. we're like what the hell is going on..we can see all the cars around us were pretty much all thinking the same thing and were slowing down. finally the cop car tells us to stop our cars and the car goes to the middle divider because some car was over there. i thought it was going to be some kinda repeat of what i saw down in l.a. last year during our trip. two officers get out and approach the car and talked to the driver. not sure what was going on but the officers get back in the car and do a 180 and drives back to us and tells us not to move until we see him go to the shoulder. he drives back to the car and both of them go to the shoulder and off at the exit. all the cars start inching forward slowly..since we're all probably wondering what the hell just happened...

bizarre weekend i tell ya...."

"event","I remember when we danced.

I remember when we saw down to earth just you and me.

I remember  listening to ATC with your dad on the way home and we said it was their first song, and he said it was their last. 

I remember how eating pop tarts was my thing and you watching my chubby butt eat them was your thing. 

I remember when everyone else thought he was cute and we laughed.

but what I really remember is when no one else would listen but you would you saved me, never stop loving you for that

we are far from the same and we were far from best friends but we had our thing and you miss hodges were my blonde bombshell right along with the rest of the world that will love and miss you just like me.
		
July 30,2004- we lost her in an accident, rest in peace katie.

""crashed like an atom bomb down to the earth, said we don't all live forever guess someday I'll see you all around.""

"event","so today I was standing in the rain. 
and I was playing in it.
because that isn't my life at all. 
my life is what I make it,
not the doctors. 
and not those people, 
who don't really know me at all. 
so today I was standing in the rain. 
and I was playing in it.
becuase that isn't my life at all. 
really.
I have a bigger heart than you will ever have. 
no matter how sick it may be, it will never stop
beating, 
loving, 
caring, 
ever. 
really. 
so today I was standing in the rain.

"event","Okay.....so I see Rin falling for someone else and I am so happy for him.  That kid deserves someone who values him.  Kite is happy with Hiroshi and I am not used to seeing him wandering aroudn here.  I think Gakuto is finally seeing there are more men than me in the world...Which yeah it does hurt.  Alot.  But I want him happy and I dont' think I can make him as happy as I used to.  I can still love him even if he is with another.  No matter what I will protect my Kitten.

So that leaves me doesnt' it?  Funny isn't it that I have made a small empire making other people's lives full of companionship.  Hell half my family thinks I am some sort of pimp.  I guess I am.  but I make peopel happy which matters more to me.  So why am I feeling so restless...?  I have Saeki, but I know his interest in me is fleeting.  He does have intense feelings for at least one other possibly two...so I will hold him until it is time to let him move on.

Then there is Masaharu. Where did he come from anyway?  He as this guy that stalked me.  Then he stopped and I missed him.  Now I am teh one looking for him.  I hired him to do the lounge of teh main ofice building.  If it turns out how I think it will maybe I will hire him to do soemthing similar to my penthouse....

PLUS Taki left me for two weeks and the manis so wonderfully good at his job that I can't seem to function as well without him here...and I know Hiyo misses him.  

I think I will set an alarm to remember to eat lunch....possibly one for dinner too..."

"event","I thought I had seen everyone and everything. I own and run a dating escort service for the love of all teh gods.  After a few years you DO see and hear it all.  Or enough of it that you just dont want to know anymore of it.

Kiego...I though we had at least mild respect for each other.

Then he messed with Jirou.  And invaded my property one to many times.  Ran like a coward.  Tried to use his money to hurt me and then he spat on me.  

He has lost any semblance of respect I had for him.  If Jirou wasn't so attactched I woudl ...well what I woudl so is of little conswquence."

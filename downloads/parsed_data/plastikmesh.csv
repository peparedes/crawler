went to macdonalds and then to the bus station. however no buses came [as usual] so we got a taxi to warner bros' cinema to see the matrix =) it's really good, just a bit predictable lol. plus i said 'which films he in?' and beffi went 'it's tom cruise!' so ye i felt an arse. but i no know actors :s
then we went to megabowl to wait for the taxi which would come in half an hour :( and we talked to andy as he was sat at the bar waiting for jay to finish work. 
omg beffi lost a 'bee'  earring :*( so we had to go to the cinema and ask whether ppul'd seen it and beffi was on her knees looking hehe. though we were very red faced!
then the taxi came and we went to get beffi a train :( though the evile chocolate bar machine robbed her of 50p! grrr
i hope she gets home okies cos some man scared her on the train coming :( poor beffi.

lunch time i went to macdonalds and this guy with a little son was behind me going 'this is macdonalds son, it's fast food' emphasising the FAST FOOD because we were in a queue and he kept saying 'bloody hell by the time you get your FAST food it's cold' etc he was just so rude i wanted to turn round and slap him. i hate parents swearing around kids, especially really young kids *sigh* the world today huh..
then last night lee and i watched my pet semetary video  which is soo good/freaky only i fell asleep by mistake. lee's given me night nurse all week it knocks me out =s

lee and jay and mee went to preston to meet hungover lewis hehe then to the tran station. we were all being dead hyper and laughing at this lady but you really had to be there. and lewis was complaining cos a can of sprite / coke cost him 85p!!!
then we went to meet beffi which was luvleh and glenneth came too =) but lee etc wanted food and beffi wanted to go to afflecks so i went with them and lee got mad and i was gonna cry so we went back to the food court and sat with them. though lee found a clairey twin look alike who looked nothing like me! grr
and beffi gave me a talking nemo whale from her happy meal <3 aww. so then we went round afflecks and i got a skirt with punk fluff on the bottom and i bought lee a present which turned out to be the top hed wanted for months and i didnt even know that lol.
then we went to a fancy place for alcohol and we had to go home after that :( but it went so badly cos beffi and glen see lee's bad side everytime and they never see that he cares for me or that he's the sweetest guy ever because he got really nasty yesterday =( its only cos his friends were there =(
then hay lee and i froze and waited for a non existant bus home and i slept at lee's. then this morning we went with lee's mum, grandad and sister to the big car boot sale yeyy and we bought lots <3

i never get to have girly chats or girly nights because im a loner and ppul just hate me.
at work i try and join in but because im not caked in makeup or taking diet pills and beig a real girly in their eyes due to the fact i dont have blonde in my hair, im just never included.
i want to go to preston college so much just because ppul this yr at newman bullied me all thru school and i don't have the confidece to take it anymore.
i wish so much i could just go back to last yr.
lee would still love me like he used to, i'd have friends ad i'd feel i was doing something with my life.
i dunno how to quit my job tho im too afraid to hand my notice in and im so used to earning i cant even pay off my moped :(

"event","So what can I say? My dreams have come true. I got what i want finally. The girl of my dreams and she's just as in love with me as I am with her. I think about her all the time, there's never a moment that couldnt be spent better thinking about tybee. She's just so everything im looking for. And now im in college and i've finally found something that i can hold on to forver and ever. And she wont pass like a fad and she's not going to leave me. At least that i can see. Im so in love with her, more in love than i've ever been. I didnt think i could top what meggs and i had had. But. . . life moves on i suppose and love only gets sweeter.

She wrote me an Lj post thi momrnig and asked me to check hen she called to wake up. I of course, the ass that I am, Said that i could check it later. And in the back of my mind I said to myself "" would it really take so much just to go and check her Lj?"" but i said sleep first. And now i check it, and its a distinctly breakfast wake up Lj that she probably just wote before she caled me. And it would have been so sweet to read it this morning but i just kinda let her love roll of me and i fell back asleep. I wish i had just put in the extra effort. I alway end up wishing i had done it. Instead of being proud that i gave tybee my all.

Well anyways thats over now. the next tybee is like "" get online and look at pictures or check my lj or i sent you an email"" i'm going to do it. and everytime after that. Cause i love her so damn much, and now that i've got hr im never going to let her go. 

Tybee Ren I love you so damn much. Just look at what we've gone through so far, look at the entries prior to this. Now that I've got you im just so elated that i could cry about it. Im so happy to have you beautiful. I love you ."

"event","Well me and tybee are doing better. I know that sound weird because im fairly certain the last post is about her hurting me, But we're doing better. I guess she just finally figured out i didnt care if she was neurotic. And it probably helps that il be out of her hair for 10 days starting wednesday. We were tlking about it and she told me to never put it like that ever again cause its going to be hard. Yea it is. We finally made out and it was everything that i could have hoped for. Her body is amazing. We only got to second base, but im not in a hurry to get to third or home plate. If we dont get there, ill still be just as content. God shes beautiful. Its going to hard to leave this one behind, and shes not even my girlfriend. I got lotsa love for that girl.

And it turns out meggean had sex with shuggs in front of some of my friends. And the're pictures from what i hear.The hard part is im not suprised. Still hit me like a load of bricks though. And then i told the person in question that i dont care anymore. If she dosent have respect for herself than i have none for her. And that i cant love a person i dont respect. So I dont really want to talk to her that much. I guess people that you once cared about change. Pity."

"event","Im so down. I finding it hard to put a smile on my face again. Im racking my brain to figure out what i did wrong, what i could have done better, what i didint do at all. Its not even thats shes gone completely its that shes just lost the feelings for me. and she dosent even know why. She says there is nothing wrong with me but everything obviously isnt right.Things that might have made me happy a month ago now do nothing for me. And i think that ill be out of here in three weeks and that its going to be better, but i dont see it going that way. Every time i try to get my mind off it, i keep getting this vision of her laying on my floor in short jean cuttoffs and a wife beater. Its just she was so everything i wanted. Not just in a physical aspect, cause she had that too, but she had everything going for her. Other than the obvious fear of commitment, she had it all. and she was right there in my hands, and i let it fall away. I wish i could go back a week and try it again. Maybe i would understand what i did wrong. She says its her fault but i dont really believe her. this is probably my fault. 

And were still really good friends, thats what gets me again. I hung out with her last night and I was nothing more than a friend. I had no hope of becomming more than a friend. I dont know if i ever will. I just miss what we had. And it wasnt even much. we didnt even date, and it wasnt ever brought up. Its just i tried so hard to get things right, and it didnt even matter.

My only hope is that maybe ill be able to date her next summer. Maybe. i know im probably just setting myself up for loss again, but ive never been one to look very far into the future."

"event","So everything that i had feared came true. I got attached to tybee and shes backing off. I dont even know what to do. Im crushed. I dont think she realized how much i like her. She says shes going to miss me alot when i move but the fact is im already gone. Arent i? if a relationship isnt growing its dead. I fail to see how this could be considered as growth. Godamnit, i can never get this shit right. She says its her fault and that shes sorry, but thoes are the worst words to hear. If its her fault that she cant be happy with me, than how am i to make it better. I cant do anything if its her fault. And worse yet is i think that i never had a chance. I did everything i could think of to make the girl happy, and it still wasnt there. And theres nothing i can do. 

I like everything about that girl. Im just so sad about this whole thing. When shes around, its amazing. But theres always this fear in the back of my mind that shes going to go home afterwards and tell me why she cant do this. But i just keep comming back. If i wanted to count id say that this is the third time shes hurt me in, jesus 2 maybe 3 months. This time it was bad though. Really bad. God im tired of trying so hard and not getting anywhere, and then when i finally do get somewhere, she has a change of heart. In a couple days im going to be angry about it, but right now im just sad. stuff like this kinda sux alot."

"event","Lately things have been in limbo. Ive been aware of time. No time to do this and so little time left until this happens. And I cant do anything about the little time i have left except let it pass. I have about a month until i move again. I get to try to make new friends again, new routine, new everything. Tho i may know some of them already, i think that its going to bbe just like moving away. Why is it that im never content with what i have, even when im happy? Why do i always have to be ultra critical of people. Why is it that i can only see the greener grass on the other side?

I tried so damned hard to not get to know anyone here. Especially girls, so that i wouldnt have to go through the leaving again. God forbid that i live life to the fullest everyday, i have to wait till my last semester in highschool to start really getting out there and doing what i want. I got my tattoo and i think i liked it alot. I know i like how it looked, but that pain is somethin straight out of the past. Reminds me of a kid i once knew that liked the pain of it all.

Then theres this girl named tybee ren diskin. 

I can see why this lesson is important to me. It shows me that what i want in life does exist just that getting it will be impossible for a guy like me. Im an asshole. Really i am. Ive hurt people to have the company of hurt people. Not to mention how i fucked over meggean. 

This love thing isnt really helpin me any, though im sure i wont stop trying. I really need someone to take my mind of everything. Someone to put effort into. I want to love but i think that all love must end. 

Religion and I dont speak. I have faith, that is to say there is some sort of will that pushes chance. I dont know were i fall into that. A god that truely sees everything would more than enjoy over-looking me.

Im tired lately. Im going to miss alot of people. Why is it that everyone i talk to is unhappy. HOw come everyone has had a tough life? what is that to say for humanity?"

"event","Well. what should i expect. It cant be normal, like a normal person would react. We have to over react. The when i try to defend myself, shes going to cut me off and be childish about it. 

So i fucking asked a question to really know what the fuck she was talking about. so i want to know the truth. It dosent fucking matter if she hasnt lied to me in the past, i had to know were we stood. I though it was clear that i was sorry. I could have lied and just not told her it was me, or i could have just kept on asking questions. I mean what the fuck. He give a fat shit. She didnt tell me anything that crazy wild or anything. I wanted to know how she really felt. And then shes pissed about me not telling her i was in wilmington. Ill tell her im in wilmington when i have time to see her. Lets say i told her im in wilmington. O look, we cant hang out anyways. But then i was like itd be nice to let her know and just fucking talk like friends, but no i have to be an exboyfriend forever as it seems. So i thought we were don after we talked about it, but no thats not to be i suppose.

So shuggs, a girl ive never met is bitching at me. And i wrote back and it was removed. Im going to repost it on my site. The thing about it is, is that when she took it down she didnt prove me wrong, she proved me right. There was somehting in there that she didnt want to see put in writing cause it stuck a chord. And so she deleted it. How childish. God were did the girl i loved go.

Fuck."

"event","I guess i have nothing really left to say on chris and meggean. She dosent care about what people say. And shes right, Eo peeps are fucking ridiculous. I dont care about what they say and i dont care when they lie. Yea lie. Me and mike deffinently did not make out @ my going away rave. My brother and mom were there. the only thing that happened was torben grinding my mom after she had a few. Chris was trying to get waith a girl named jesse and i had a god damn good time. Thats what happened. This guy named kris got with samantha and me and my brother tore some shit up listening to heavy metal @ fucking max volume. I miss that party. I was cool with everyone and nobody had problems with me. Why are all my guy friends throwing the bird to morality. Not even just chris. Mike is smoking and tearing up a whole bunch of girls. Kt says she dosent care but id be hurt if my ex was having promiscuous sex. Ahh it just gets to me. People dont care anymore. SELFISH. everyone, lets do what the fuck makes me feel good and who gives a fuck about everyone else. I guess that works to get by sometimes. And sometimes i think that maybe i just need to throw down and embrace everything i feel like doing. Maybe then i could flunk out of college or not even go. Sounds like a pretty big hassle to me. I think that i could do porn pretty easily. Im big enough and im not nasty looking so why the hell not. Lets see how many girls i can tear up in the next couple months. I bet i can make a shit load of money too. And then i could come back home and ask my parents what they though about my life and everything nice they ever did for me. And then my mom would cry for days to find out about it but what the hell do i care. Shes not me. Its my life. Its not as if my life is important to anyone else. RIGHT?
  Fuck me. Im done with this. Meggean is right about alot of things she says. Mike isnt going to get a better girl than kt bilzi. And its going to hurt him later in life what he does now. Im never going to stop caring about meggean and i dont see us wounding each other stopping any time soon. Even if i just paid her no attention, would that not be hurtful. And when i care and pay her attention, is that not also painful to her? Meggean's right that chris is a good guy and hes trying to get better. From what i know he is. But will he even admit to saying the tings he said to me? What if he tells her im lieing. Who would she wish to believe? The guy that is there enough to comfort her and that can spend time with her and not have to call to see her, or the guy that dumped her out in the cold from afar that just looks at her life under a microscope and tells her what she fucked up. I'd take the easy road. 
  It makes me think about myself. and my motives over the past 3 years. Isnt this what i wanted for her? for her to find someone other than me to make her happy? Isnt this why i let her go so that she could clear-consciously be happy about herself, and be with someoen that she could do whatever she wants when she wants with? This whole situation is making me sick. I want to be passed this already. I want to drink myself into oblivion. I just dont trust the people down here. I dont party cause none of them are really my friends. I could get drunk or something and if the cops were called, id probably take the blame. They would do something like that. And so i dont party. I just sit @ home and brood. I cannot wait to leave this city. I wish that i could just graduate now and leave. I want to spend time with my brother. I love him alot. Im just going to move on. . 
  As for meggean. I think i want her to fight me. Thats sounds weird when i say it, but to just get this angst out between us. I know i want to fight chris, i know id get my ass kicked. But maybe it would help out. I kinda want to fight mike too just cause how he is hurting kt. Id kick his ass though. And to maybe knock some scince into his fucking head about going to college maybe and stop smoking. He knows it ruined his moms life. im just disappointed with how my friends in north carolina have changed. I cant shake this feeling that if i hadnt moved that maybe i could have kept some people in check. I knw me and meggs wouldnt have broken up, and i would never have let mike smoke. I would've punched that cigarette on the burn, right into his face.
  Tybee is right about these kinda things when she says its easier to hide and run from feelings that hurt. Maybe thats why humanity/ morality has survived this long cause people just look over entire portions of their lives. Never squaring away with the skeletons in their closet. Maybe i am really Arcanenow. Still holding on to a dwindling school of thought. I can help but compare it to the movie dragon heart. Were chivalry is all but dead. Neways, im out for now."

"event","I think i overstepped my bounds by confronting meggean about her actions. I really think that im just jealous that shes found a situation that can continually make her happy. Who am i to try to make her give that up. I think its that pared with knowing that chris is better in the sack than i am. Esecially about how meggean must think of me in bed. Me= not to damn good at all. I suppose thats what happens when your just losing your virginity. It kills me the way he talked about her though. When i was talking to him about it. Hes so fucking cocky. "" Ill try to get her off me, i know some girls can be addicted to my sex. Some girls consider me a god behind a penis."" Who the fuck is so arrogant. Im baligerant and cocky to but damn. He put her down in front of me. He told me everything i needed to know about his feelings for her. Neways she needs to figure things out on her own. Shes not stupid so im not going to make her out to be. 
  I've picked up a love for french lately. And piano. its kinda weird but it makes me feel good. I cant help but feel like i really need a girlfriend right now. Maybe im beginning to understand what meggean is feeling. But, man. the piano. I enjoy it alot. I picked up a couple chords and jazz riffs and its just a blast. Coupled with mr prior piano experience and my knwlege of music anyways, It rather fullfilling to me. I saw this on a peice of art today. I used to really understand this feeling so im going to save it here so when the time comes i can remember it.

The egyptians had a thousand words for sand. The eskimos had five hundred for snow. I wish i had that many  words for love, but all i have is the feeling of you rubbing up against me when we sleep."""

"event","So what the Fuck. Meggean is sleeping with chris. What the fuck is that. I mean jesus christ, i have nothing against her sleeping with people but its like shes having sex with my brother. I dont know why it angers me so. Maybe im jealous that shes getting laid on demand and im not. Maybe its cause in some weird way i still think shes mine. It just gets me angry, chris is such a slut and he abuses women. She deserves alot better than that. I just hope shes not attached and that she knows what shes doing. I know that she said that she wasnt reallyattached to him, and that she's just attached to having someone there. Hold on a fucking second. I could have sworn she was trying to not be co dependant. Like a 12 step program or something. Honestly if you need someone or something else to make you feel good it just puts yourself down. Shes just lost so much respect for herself. Weres the meggean i fucking fell in love with 3 years ago. Meggean is going down hill. Shes not a slut. Shes not. I know the girl, she has a sex drive dont get me wrong, but she not a whore like this. Its just so fucking hard to here my friends bad mouth her. And about her pics. Not the best move but we all make mistakes. But they laugh at her, and they dont know what shes fucking been through. Its so hard to hear that shes a ho from your best friend. No girl i have ever fallen for is a whore. Meggean anne scott is leagues ahead of what she is right now. She needs to find herself again. She needs to look in a mirror. What she really needs to do is get to know herself by herself. Figure out who she is, and who she wants to be. It feels like im watching a movie, like the butterfly effect or requiem for a dream. And im watching the girl i once loved fall into desolation just to get attention/feeling/wanted. She need to learn that shes more than a peice of meat for guys to claw at. Especially chris. And the the fact that she still loves me hurt to hear. In fact thats the worst part, i feel like shes doing it to get my attention. Like, the pics didnt work the way i planned, so ill see if sleeping with his good friend will. to see if he'll come around and take me back or soemthing. I dont know, maybe im just thinking out of my asshole. And it hurt all the more to see her degrade herself like this, and thinking that if i just gave in and dated her again she would become a respectable woman. I guess it all comes around to class. Its not even her fault. Its not her fault she isnt classy. I just wish she wasnt trashy. Chris mcguire is like rob groom. dating the youngins and taking what means the most to them. Thinking that hes the only one they can get it from. God meggean look at who you are. Look at were you come from. Do better for yourself. Be the girl i know you are inside. Im just so dissapointed. She is so much better. shes is so much better than all this. Maybe i just dont know her anymore. Its certainly a turn for the worse . I hope she gets out of it. 

 All this isnt really my place at all to speak on, and i cant believe i said anything. I gues i was just so hurt by my close friends wanting to use her for their own enjoyment. Somehting that i care so much about being used for a good fuck. Shes a fucking human being. I cant believe shes letting it work like that. She says that at this point in her life anything she can do to be happy she does so that she can be happy. But is she going to feel better about herself? Can she looke herself in the mirror after and say this is who i am? I have to give chris some credit tho, he is at least a good friend to her. But when it comes down to it, shes someone he can fuck. If he didnt have sex with her would they still fall asleep together? She asked me once if i could tell the difference between love and lust. I would pose the same question to her. Is a means to end good enough? Why the hell is she settleing for good enough. God why cant she see herself in the light that i do. Shes a prize to be won and she needs someone to tell that to her. And it looks like it was me, she needs to act so that people think that. Its not even a matter of me running her life, or me lecturing her or not. I care about her and i dont want to see her as my good friend's favorite fuck. It hurts me down deep cause i thought she was more dependant on character than that. Neways, maybe its what she needs right now. Dosent make it right though. I hope she knows that no matter what she does ill still care about her, but that dosent mean ill respect her. I date people i respect. I fool around with people that i can get. Thats how it works in guys minds."

"event","So I was reading Buffy fanfiction.......yet again. And I came across one of my first stories when I was like 12. Quite sadistic and crazy for a twelve-year old, but its cool. Based off a buffy plot line, but you can tell I got carried away with my own ideas.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/~darkwicca17"">www.fanfiction.net/~darkwicca17</a><br /><br />The story is on the link at the bottom, I'm reading it now, haha<br /><br />anywaysssss<br /><br />These past few weeks have been INTERESTING, at the least. One in particular event comes to mind, but I won't bore you, haha....<br /><br />cricket cricket<br /><br />click it?<br />noooooo<br /><br /><br />haha,&nbsp;<br /><br />ps.^^ not that event<br /><br />lol<br /><br />School is busy i suppose. I think I'm taking Supa english next year, quite a bit sum of money but i make triple that in the summer, so its all good. Plus I'm working winter break, so praise Oprah, I finally have money, lol.<br /><br />Drama is 6 days out of the week, which leaves like nooooo time really to do anything. I'm pretty sure if one more person comments to me about Mr. Prunner going all mommy dearest on me, or telling me not to hang w/ kayleigh, we deffffff will have a smaller drama club. haha<br /><br />I'm still not sure what I am doing w/ my life in terms of college or career. Half of me has always wanted to teach elementary but the other half always wanted to write and direct television. I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point.<br /><br />My keyboarding skills have deff been improving and now I can play a piece of beethoven[ ode to joy], jingle bells, I just called[to say i love you], and many more<br /><br />However the latin front is a bust. Really hard to self-teach, and personally I have no time, or that much interest to do it all the time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was thinking about going to graduate school in Cali, doubt I could get into UCLA, but maybe UCD or something along those terms.&nbsp;<br /><br />OH and I learned how to make scrambled eggs!! Iv'e been making them everyday for the fam, and im pretty sure they are hiding the eggs from me, cause now we have like none, and yesterday we had a bunch, haha<br /><br />I'm working on doing my own laundery, althought im kinda nervous that my stuff is gonna turn all pink or everything's gonna shrink, but I""m gonna have to learn cuz im deff not coming home every week just for laundery. haha<br /><br />Mad excited for college, not gonna false-truth you<br /><br />So apparently I have heard ppl say Mad erie, and erieball quite a lot, so I get to make ally frazzled because she told me it would never catch on. here is our exact conversation we had in gym like a couple months ago aka like 2<br /><br />Ally: Omg, kayla, do not get killed<br />Me: hahaha, mad erie ally<br />Ally: [bursts out laughing] who the fuck says erie? mad erieee, erieball. your so sketch<br />Me: omg, I so am going to say it all the time, and watch it catch on, just watch<br />Ally: yeah ok kayla,&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />YEAH, WHAT NOW ALLY ,WHAT NOW<br /><br />=]<br /><br />I think I'm gonna write a rock opera<br /><br />don't ask where that came from<br /><br />and omg, rent is coming next month, and my mom's getting tickets<br /><br />mad excited&nbsp;<br /><br />Rent is my anti-drug<br /><br />which is funny because half of the show is mostly about drugs<br /><br /><br />ahhh<br /><br /><br />irony is funny that way<br /><br /><br />harry potter and the deathly hollows is coming out 7/21/07, and I HAVE to beat my record of 4 hours and 15 minutes as my time I read the half-blood prince<br /><br />I'm erie that way, lol<br /><br />Today is the superbowl btw<br /><br />LETS GO BEARS<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />even tho football is still a mystery to me"

auditions today, pretty much consisted of

getting choked to death by kayleigh
chasing kayleigh
making lesbian poses w/ kayleigh
dancing and singing w/ kayleigh
talking about ppl w/ kayleigh


hmmmm, im starting to realize someting, haha

my head still hurts from hitting the wall, when i tried to hug kayleigh...never again =]

I'm kind of tired but usually when im in the ""heat"" of writing, i can't sleep until its like I feel like I finished. Like if im halfway throught a chapter, i cannot sleep or focus until its done and its out of my head. A cool habit and a CURSE at the same time

so far the senior classes i have chosen so far are

gov't/ecomomics
supa english
gym
portfolio[art]
science of art and/or physics
spanish 5
Sat prep perhaps?

all the guidence counslors are saying that if u go to a two year college, that when you transfer to a 4 year, they don't even look at the SAT's or ACT's, only what u did in college. so im not so worried on that front, math i pretty much suck in...so yeah

so far my learning latin idea is bombing. I have a pro and con list:

PRO
1.&nbsp;broadens &nbsp;vocab since most words orginate in latin
2. helps my transcript for colleges


CON
1. is a dead language
2. really hard to learn, especially the grammer w/ the constants and hyphens, etc etc


i think i'll stick w/ it"

do laundry and iron better, haha 
cook(not so good on that front) 
studying permit book 
getting up and sleeping at odd hours 
listening skills&nbsp;
keeping things clean &amp; orderly
studying 
thinking about getting a job(notice the thinking part) haha

although if i hear i should work at wegmens one more time, haha although another summer teaching spoiled ADHD kids spanish......*sigh*

I have also made a schedule complete w/ time limits and everything for my day to day activites. from getting up to going to bed, i got it all planned out. Now I gotta see if I can stick to it, or totally blow it off and sit around 

I have also pressured myself to go to curves more. although I'm deff not gaining any, im also not losing either, so i gotta get on that. 

and then we get to school,&nbsp;

deff got to study on for like 99.9 of my tests, cuz i usually don't do so well when i dont. also got to work on the homework, haha.......ha 


and also my spirtual side, cuz right now i have none. So I'm gonna find it, and if i can't find it in catholism, then I'll keep looking. So far meditating as been working, but im deff not into buddhism. i like my material posssesions, thank you very much. plus, i like my hair also&nbsp;

so mucho kayla improving

not that i don't like myself. No modesty here! totally love myself, lol

***side note, every chapter begins with definition of the chapters emotion and usually will end with said word

*** side note, also where ever there is a ________, it is the master vampire but i simply have yet to find a name for him.


Defeat: acceptance or resignation to the prospect of defeat or loss.

Rylee couldn't breathe. All around her, the bodies of her friends, the same people came with her to this hell hole. Dead. Because of her. For three hours straight she heard their screams of pain, their struggles and useless pleading. Her gag had muffled her screams while she strained against the chains, pinning her to the wall.

The sound of footsteps echoed, as they led to the metal door of her chamber. Rylee caught her breathe, as the door opened and Master_______, treaded carefully into the room, fresh blood on his smirking lips. He laughed as she jerked away from his presence, while he undid her chains and released her gag. Rylee gasped as pain washed over her when she collapsed to the cold floor with a Thud. ______ squated next to her, closing his eyes as the smell of lingering fear, anger, and grief filled his nostrils. Giving a little laugh while merriment filled his eyes, he lowered his mouth to her shaking body and sung softly in her ear.

""Little Rylee filled with sorrow
No precious friends to see tomorrow
Oh what will little Rylee do?
Alone in here, with just us two""


Smirking at his quick witted song, ________ stood up, and spoke with a commanding voice.

""Maybe now, with your fellow slaves dead, you can focus your attentions on your love for me"" he said as he was certain this was the end of her struggles with his dominance.
A
s the last of Rylee's hope of ever being freed disappeared with her friend's lives, a grim determination settled in her eyes while glaring at his eternally youthful face.

""I will NEVER love you"" she spat, anger slowly filling her as she tried to crawl away from him. Chuckling to himself, ________ grabbed her by the hair, and threw her harshly against the corner of the stone wall. Shaking his head disbelief of her disobedience, he saundered to the chamber door, closing the door behind him, just as he whispered loud enough for her to hear.

""I don't need your love, precious Rylee. When I have your soul""

As soon as the door slammed from his forceful hands, did Rylee let the tears fall down. Sobbing for the friends she had lost, and the life she once knew, she could only describe her emotions in one word.






Defeat.






end of chapter..



suprisingly....that took a long time for me to write in school



^^^^^ this is just a prolouge, ie the  first page before the first chapter. the first chapter will begin in the beginning of the story. I thought it was suspensefull to know the middle of the story, and also fall in love with the maind and side characters, but be also aware of their impending doom.

"event","So today was really boring and tiring. I went to US and got a bunch of notes and homework. Went to Art History, had a sub, went to leave, but noticed I had no where to go, so I hung w/ kelly and steph. Crashed all three lunches, same old same old. Saw kayleigh *suprise* and did the random hallway walking we usually do. Spanish was cool. 88 on my unit test what? ha

Now I'm home, kinda bored
I usually am always home alone for absurd amount of hours, which i like, but its boringgggg sometimes....


Maybe I'll study??..

"event","so I tend to dream a lot. Usually pretty creepy, confusing, inner turmoil dreams. But every once in awhile i get a dream where i kinda get the feeling that it needs to be written down

basic synopsis is:

*side note- every chapter begins w/ a dictionary term, because main character falls back on reading the dictionary as a outlet for emotions

character obsesses w/ vampires; modern teen; 
character notices strange omens; disbelief in omens; confused
character gets captured; sold into demon/vampire slavery
character gets owned by notorious vampire; goes through training; killing; sex games; smut; etc etc
character falls in love w/ male slave
love interest dies due to main characters infactuation
character begins to give up hope in escape
character is set free by group of vampire hunters
character is free; returns to normal life
character comes back home; to find family dead; all trick; blood on wall saying ""did u miss me""
character notices master vampire in house

end

this plot changes constantly w/ my imagination
much research is needed, but i think if i work hard, this could be a good novel

"event","sooo, here is another journal I will write in, and forget about in a week. ha. 
I have decided to list my current stressgasms:
1.) school-long, boring, pretty much lost any ambition in it, lately
2.) writing- Iv'e had this story idea in my head for quite awhile, but I have no idea how to start it, and its keeping me up
3.) Insomnia- pretty sure I have it, driving me crazzzzyyy
4.) Grease- so not ready for everyday rehearsal, stress, and getting lectured at.
5.) Junior prom- not so exciting not cuz im kinda dateless, but in general. I think I'll wait for senior prom. But on the other hand, am i losing a cool high school memory because I chicken out?
6.) a Job- kayla needs some moola, and cannot stand another summer w/ kids again. plus its only a summer, and winter/spring break job. But i need something w/ flexible hours and close by. blehhhhh
7.) Homework- just a bummer
8.) Career- gah!! not knowing what i wanna do in life is driving me crazy. teacher pretty much guarentees me a position probably anywhere, plus i like teaching kids. But is that what i wanna do for the rest of my life, when I would much rather write for tv/ or produce movies. But is that the risky career?
9.) My permit- I freakin need to get it! so not gonna be like my mom and not learn how to drive. But alas my dad doesn't want to be pay extra money on his insurance or w/e. why must i suffer w/ family money issues?
10.) Life in general- pretty much said it all


^^^ lots to think about over....coffee and spanish tarea...*sigh*

i think i will end every journal w/ a quote from now on

"event","hello.
I am still at Cranbrook but I'm coming home tomorrow for the weekend and then back to school on Monday night. Yay! I am going to have to hang out with my friends somewhat. 
I have finally gone swimming here. I love the pool and the diving board. I think swimming at Berkley High starts soon, like as soon as HUB ends. Practices are like from 5:45 until 6:45 in the morning. Ohh joy!

Um...We have like two major projects that are due on Tuesday. A french one and an English one.

va te faire foutre!

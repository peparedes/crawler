"event","I know we're in a rough spot right now. I know you are hurt by me, and I know I hurt you with that song. I didn't want to publicly smear you, and I know saying I was drunk isn't an excuse for you. You've hurt me. You've hurt me so much I can't even think. But I know it's only because I've hurt you more. I hate the fact that I hurt you so much that you feel like you have to do things like this. I feel like a bitch for posting that email you wrote to Louis. I know that was meant for him, and that you never intended me to read it. I know you didn't mean to hurt me with that, it just ended up that way. The email you wrote me is enough to tell me how you really feel, and I will understand when you go into rage sometimes. I will miss you, you know I loved you and always will somehow. I can't even explain how I feel about you because it's so contradicting. Sometimes, when you're saying such passionately hate filled things to me, I just wish I could die. But I know you don't mean them. I know you don't because of the one email you wrote me. It only takes one time for you to tell me how you really feel, and the truth will shine through because, whether you think so or not, I do know you and I know you aren't a bitch. I know you're loving and the only reason you're lashing out is because you're so hurt. I'm hurt too. The whole thing just hurts. I'll always remember you, though, and I'm sorry about the stupid things I've been doing."

"event","oh, my life. <i>what</i> is going <i>on</i>???? rawr. I've officially moved out of my madison apartment. It was hard. I left a lot of stuff behind. Maybe that's for the best. I don't know how much I will be able to handle being apart from Ash. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fine, of course... we didn't work out. But god I still love her. It's a weird kind of love. Protective... motherly almost... on Thursday night, it was our last night together in the apartment, and we were just watching TV and feeling... lonely, I think, and she put on Third Eye Blind. And this song came on: <br><b>I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore, Before you take a swing, I wonder What are we fighting for? When I say out loud, I want to get out of this, I wonder, Is there anything I'm going to miss, Iwonder how's it going to be, When you don't know me, How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there, How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to about, How it's going to be, 'Cause I don't care, How's it going to be, where we used to laugh, There's a shouting match, Sharp as a thumbnail scratch, A silence I can't ignore, Like the hammocks and the doorways we spent time in, Swing empty, don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me, I guess that is how it's going to be. How's it gonna be when you don't know me, any more How's it going to be. Want to get myself back in again, The soft dive of oblivion. Want to taste the salt of your skin The soft dive of oblivion.</b><br>And I just started bawling. We both started crying, and held each other, and I missed her. I spent such a significant part of my life with her, and it was a hard time in my life too. Despite the bad times... she <i>was</i> always there for me. She was so many contridicting things for me. She held me back, but she set me free... she brought down my self expression, but she brought up my self esteem... she made me feel important, but to no one but her. I don't understand my feelings towards her at all. I don't want to be with her, and I'm happy she's moving on, but when I see Crysty's livejournal, I feel twinges of jealousy, and even lonliness for Ash. <br><center>It's pissing me off.</center><br>"

"event","i can be gay and be in love with christ, can't i? jesus has lead me through a lot of touch times, and i know that people who are so faithful sound like complete lunatics, especially if their gay, seeing as ""god hates fags""... god doesn't hate fags, people who think that christianity is a religion instead of a way of life hate fags. i'm just loving honestly, like the song says.

<i>""Don't Hold Back is a song about loving honestly. I think that we, especially in America, are a lot more scared of love than we let on. We become so entranced by the images of romance that we see on TV, that when our real life romance become real life we begin to think that they're broken. It's not the relationships that are broken, it's us that are. As humans we will let each other down, but I believe love is worth the pain that it brings. 1st John 4:12 says ""No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us. We need to be able to love, because it's only in love that we are brought closer to the Lord.""</i>

time is a slow sword that can pierce any armor. as we drown, our tide in, from ghost of one another. don't hold back. it's all that i can do to keep smiling. don't hold back. could you kiss me if i was crying. i can't we slip out of these lives. slip into a love where fears not choking. instead we're getting bit like flies. we think that light will hide the fact that we're not broken. don't hold back. it's all that i can do to keep smiling. don't hold back. could kiss me if i was crying. can it be so? can it be so? to say.... can it be so? can it be so? to say i love you. don't hold back. it's all that i can do to keep smiling. don't hold back. could you kiss me if i was crying. or dying. or feeling fine. it's all that i can do to keep smiling. don't hold back. could you kiss me if i was crying. or dying. or feeling fine. don't hold back."

WHY: in celebration of all things Halloween

TIMES---

5:00 pm: music, non-alcoholic beverages, a few things to eat, small talk

7:00: Rocky Horror Picture Show airs for the first time, sober, in costumes, more food, games, etc

10:30: straight-edge friends that don't want to be around bent-edge activity, it's been fun, see you sometime

11:00: bent-edge activities begin, the refrigerator is opened to the public, please chip in what you can $-wise if you want to drink, bring drugs, let's do them

12:00: midnight showing of Rocky Horror, sloppy style, let's sing along, kids

2:00: you're probably pretty blitzed by now; let's play it by ear


Anyway, the guest list is as follows, in no particular order...



Phil

Issy

Xandie

Catherine

Elizabeth Hunter

If you'd like to bring a friend, please call us (608)204-6136 and ask first. Don't just show up with some annoying asshole that likes to ruin Halloween parties. Call and consult. If we say ""no,"" it's nothing personal. It depends on how many people are planning on coming, and if we've met the person that you want to bring. If you are offended that you are not on this list, well, you're probably not on because we're not in touch with you at this point, you're one of those people that hates parties, or you simply live too far away too attend. Maybe we hate you. Who knows. Anyway, we hope you'll come and enjoy the Halloween fun. Carpools are good. If you disapprove of drug-doings, leave by 10:30. I promise that nothing illegal will happen before 11:00. You have my word of honor. Now, mark your calendars.



Oh. Wear a costume if you're cool.



If you're staying past midnight, I'd suggest spending the night. Bring a sleeping satchel. There's plenty of cozy room.

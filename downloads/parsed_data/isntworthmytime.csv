"event","yesterday was the best day! we left nick's at like 730 in the morning, came home and slept until like 1230. courtney picked us up at like 3 and we went to that thing, i don't know what it was called but it was SUPER FUN. sara, j, seamus, and mike played the best songs known to man, plus sara's mom, i'm not going to try to spell her name, who is the sweetest lady ever. so many sublime songs :)

ummm, there was so much food and grown-ups there. it was molly's birthday and, surprisingly, she wasn't crazy drunk. but her and courtney are still dancing fools almost all the time. i finally saw andrea and she told me about that vietnam journey. shayne was rolling a cigarette in the front and everyone started coming over and yelling because they thought it was a joint, it wasn't awkward or anything. just kidding, it was. i felt bad becuase he didn't know anyone there, strangers are the scariest thing ever. but there was this asian guy there and he was secretly an insano guitar player. he was just standing off to the side all day video taping everything, then suddenly he whipped out this trendy white guitar and blew the whole circus tent away. it was nuts. rich made fun of me all day because he is a crotch.

but the ultimate highlight of the day was finally getting to see TANYA after 18237345861234 days. it was return of the sweet yarn head PLUS.................

"event","against me was short but fun, we had to leave early cuz courtney got sick. jeannine had to drive home from niagra falls and all i had to do was pay attention, courtney was sleeping in the back. at first it was easy, and then it got even easier, we had to stop at some places because courtney was sick obviously, but we were doing mad good. the signs were like ""rochester 40 miles... rochester 28... rochester 15..."" and then suddenly 45 minutes had gone by and we weren't even in rochester yet. for some reason we never saw any of the rochester exits... how? i don't know. and i don't understand how we didn't realize any sooner. if rochester is 15 minutes away, how do you drive for 45 minutes, not be in rochester, not see anymore rochester signs, and not notice? of course, that is what they get for putting me in charge of paying attention... i wouldn't have felt so bad if courtney wasn't so sick, all she wanted was to go home and throw up in her own toilet. if she wasn't sick i would have just laughed, you know, ""hahah, we're lost and it's my fault, you guys are tired and i'm notttt, sucks to be you.."" i don't know what i am talking about but i want to go for a walk and my parents are in the living room so i can't just walk out of the door. i was trying to be loud so they would wake up and go to bed but they wouldn't. plus i think it's raining? i am too paranoid to try and sneak out of the door with them right there becauseeee i'm shutting up now"

i hope april isn't a rainy month because the weather is so nice lately, and i hate worms when they cover my whole driveway. today melissa and michael were over all day and michael is a snot. and he dumped most of my animal crackers (the kind with icing all over them) in the sink, which was full of water, and he crumbeled the rest all over the living room carpet. but i got him back becuase when he pooped his pants i made fun of him and he cried. everyone yelled at me becuase well, he is only two years old, but i just laughed and laughed until his tiny little nose got red from crying. that's so mean, i'm going to hell.
i am falling asleep so that is why i am making no sense, today was such a long ASS day. ummmmm... what else can i talk about?! oh! defiance ohio is going to buffalo at the end of april, i can't remember the exact day though, but i think i am going to go. it seems like they could put on the funnest show.
in other news, for the past like month and a half, the lowest grade i have gotten on a math test has been AN 86%, and all the other ones have been in the 90s. i am so proud of myself :)
i am going to go now, i hope this was a pleasant update. lately i feel like i am the most pleasant girl, because things are great and SO IS EVERYONE AROUND ME."

well my mom is in california, she comes home this weekend, and then her my dad and amy are going to arizona from the 30th of this month to april 4th. where in arizona? tempe? yah. wait, isn't against me playing in arizona on april 2nd? where in arizona? tempe? YAAH. hey! can i come!?!?! NO!!! booooo i'm pissed

but anyways melissa is like living here with me and michelle when they are gone, because, you know, god forbid we are home alone for like 5 days. but i hope michael will be here the whole time :) :) :) he's so cute, he is two now :)

aaaahm what else? oh yah i forgot to mention that i am not SUPER mad about against me in arizona becuase i think we're going to go see them in canada in april. i'm excited, i have been in AGAINST ME! MODE!!!! for a lot of weeks, and i can't wait for spring break. summer is so close, i feel like it's been winter forever cuz its sooooooo cold. i hope it's not a wet rainy spring, that would suck. we need some sunshine and some heat, or i need a car. either one works. i am definitely not looking forward to the world of working for your money, aka HAVING A JOB, and the world of having to pay for things, such as a car, and the world of responsibility, i think that being a grown-up is going to suck. i have no intentions of hurrying the process.

this update is huge for me, there isn't much to say, i am too tired. i don't know what i'm talking about, i have been sitting here for way too long and i use too many commas. i'm going to sleep!"

"event","i never update! i hate school this year because i never wanna wake up. my schedule isn't that bad, and neither are my grades, i just hate going there. i'm still pretty much asleep every day for my first two classes (spanish and english) but my teachers are super nice and i'm not doing that bad. math is boring but it isn't half as bad as last year. 4th i have bio WHICH I LOVE with mr. mcbride WHO I LOVE. 5th is lunch or gym every other day. gym always sucks! 6th i have drawing and then 7th i have painting so thats fun, and then my day gets killed with GLOBAL (WHICH I SUPER SUPER HATE) with MRS. LAMORTE (WHO I SUPER SUPER SUPER HATE) and i always want to shoot myself in the face. i tried to switch out of her class like a thousand times but they won't let me becuase gates is retarded. every day i try to fight with her so she will send me to the office, and then i will go to the counselor and be like ""I HATE HER AND SHE HATES ME AND I WILL NEVER DO MY HOMEWORK AND I WILL ALWAYS SKIP CLASS AND LEAVE EARLY AND I WILL FAIL AND IT WILL BE ALL YOUR FAULT. I TRIED TO TELL YOU BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN. THERE IS A GLOBAL CLASS FOR MY GRADE AND MY LEVEL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME WITH A DIFFERENT TEACHER. WHYYYYYYYY CANT I JUST SWITCH CLASSES YOU BIG PHAT FUCKING IDIOTS."" but we always bitch at eachother and she never sends me away. what a bitch!

i need to get rich pretty soon because when i turn 16 i don't wanna be a loser with no car. UNLESS MY GRANDMA GIVES ME THE OLDSMOBILE. but even if she does, i still need madd gas money. i don't want a jobbbbbbbbbbb:(

my parents are so annoying lately! i can't stand it! every time i can't wake up in the morning, that means im on drugs. when i sit in my room to do homework or something, that means i'm depressed. there is such thing as a kitchen table, you know. and whenever i sleep at someones house, that means that i hate my family and i want them out of my life. how about get out of my face and shut up because i'm 15 years old and i'll sleep wherever i want ass."

"event","ok so i went to tops to return bottles so i could buy an against me! ticket. so i returned everything and went in to get the money. there's ONE express lane open, and two people in the line. EXPRESS LANES ARE 7 ITEMS OR LESS. the first guy is just paying, and the lady in front of us has AT LEAST 30 THINGS IN HER CART. HER TOTAL WAS $97 SOMETHING. THAT IS RUDE. so then i waited for her and got my money and went to the ticket line. the lady finally comes over and shes like ""how can i help you"" so i asked her if they had tickets for against me. she's like ""oh sorry our computers are down."" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU SAW ME STANDING IN LINE FOR 7 MINUTES WHILE YOU WERE OVER THERE DOING NOTHING, AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN TELL ME THAT YOU CAN'T SELL TICKETS RIGHT NOW ANYWAYS? THAT'S RUDE, TOO. OBVIOUSLY I WAS WAITING IN THE TICKET LINE TO BUY TICKETS. OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T BUY TICKETS IF THE COMPUTERS ARE DOWN. THERE WASN'T EVEN A SIGN SAYING ""SORRY YOU CAN'T BUY TICKETS AT THE MOMENT SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING IN LINE"" OR ANYTHING. PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID. so i went over to candence to get that part i ordered and IT'S CLOSED. THAT IS STUPID, EVERYTHING IS STUPID. I'M IRRITATED."

"event","WELL today was the first day of school. how fun. AKA it sucked. i can't believe i made it with one hour of sleep. but after school i didn't have a ride home and i was stranded, so i stayed there for a while wandering through the halls and bugging people who had phones. i couldn't find a ride that was convenient, so i walked to wendy's with some people. i walked in and saw ECASS!!! and ate a frosty. we went to all the stores (pretty much) in westmar plaza and had psychology surveys by the dumpsters. anyways, then jessalyn picked us up and we went to IAN'S and guess who was there. TANYA SURB. what a bonus that was. and i got to swing on my favorite swing and then we all went home. then i ate steak and played donkey kong, and now i'm going to take a shower and go to SLEEP!!! SLEEEEEP! i can't wait! i haven't slept in a mad minute. i left all my papers to be signed IN TIM'S POCKET. that sucked becuase now all my ""first homework grades"" are going to be zeros. won't my parents be thrilled....

(well maybe i didn't JUST realize, but you understand...) and i was going to comment and say ""hey i comment too much"" but that's just stupid. also, stina hasn't added me back yet. i haven't hung out with greg in 897465189465879+ days. i'm not too excited about going back to school. that pretty much sums up my life right now."

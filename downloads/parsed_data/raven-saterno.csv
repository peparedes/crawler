Current mood:  annoyed 


It honestly seems to me lately that I have very few real friends.  Yeah, there are people who think of me as a friend, but you know what?  They're not mine.  Just because I sit and listen while you tell me all your problems doesn't automatically mean I consider you my friend.

And it especially doesn't help when I give advice or try to help in some way and get completely blown off.

In short, all I seem to be to a lot of people is a sounding board.  A sympathetic ear to listen to their problems and give them a reassuring line or two that's exactly what they want to hear.... and when they realize I'm not going to do that, they get scared and stop talking to me for a few days... then they come back when the next problem comes up.

But you know what?  It's fine with me.  If all you want is a blank wall who actually listens to you, then you got it.  I'm tired of my advice being asked for then blown off or ignored.

So, yeah, I'll listen.  But that's it.  I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear.  I'm not going to tell you what you need to hear.  The first wastes your time, and the second wastes my time, since you don't listen.

This has other effects, too.  I'm not calling people anymore.  You want to talk to me?  You have my number?  It's all on you.

You have my screen name? Then IM me if you want to talk.  I'm not going to IM anyone first anymore.  It always seems like I IM someone to say hi and they either ignore me for a long time before saying hi or for everything I say I get short, one or two-word answers.  Sorry, but if you didn't want to talk to me, then I shouldn't have IMed you.  Simple as that.  And this will rectify that ever happening again.  

So, I'm not giving advice anymore.  I'm not calling anyone again.  And I'm not initiating IMs anymore.  Come to think of it.... writing this all in a blog is almost a waste of time.  I'm sure it'll get a few comments about how I shouldn't retreat from people, or how I shouldn't do this, or shouldn't do that... or that this is what I should do or that is what I should do.  Well save it, because I'll give it as much attention as the advice I give is given.... none.

 

If you don't have my cell number or my aim name... well... you probably wouldn't want to talk to me anyway.  

Bye."

"event","Is it wrong to be tired?

Every day I see my dreams shatter a little more.  Yes I know that that sounds horribly melodramatic.  But... let me explain.

Well here's what I want to do.  I want to go back to school.  I want to go visit my friends.  I want to have someone special in my life.  I want to have a well-paying steady job.  Those are my only aspirations in life.  Those are honestly all I need to be happy, and most of them are slipping away slowly.

Going back to school is proving to be a challenging idea.  I've had so many issues lately... health, taxes, car emergencies, bills, and day-to-day living... that my funds have shrunk to near non-existant levels.

The lack of money also makes the prospect of visiting my friends difficult at best.  It's almost to the point of when I go I may have to beg someone to crash at their place, I may not be able to afford a hotel.  let alone the car I wanted to rent.

I've just about given up on finding anyone special.  No matter who it is, how wonderful a person she is, no matter how much I may care... the feeling is never mutual.  The only women who've ever truly liked me as more than a friend all turned out to have some kind of severe mental infraction.  Personally I think this speaks volumes about me.

About the only thing I have going for me towards my dreams anymore is the steady job.  It's not really a well-paying one, though.  There are possibilities of getting a raise soon, so we'll see how that goes.  I already know I'm going to be with EB GameWorld (which is what we'll be called soon) for a long while, and my current manager is grooming me for management.  Not just to be an assistant manager, but to take over my own store one of these days.  It feels good to know that someone actually has that much faith in my abilities.

It just sucks that the only way I'll actually be able to take a position as an assistant manager would be if I didn't have to look after my grandfather anymore... and that won't happen until he passes on.

So, yeah.  All of my hopes and dreams seem to me to be shattering slowly, more and more every day.

Is it wrong to be tired?"

"event","Have you ever had the feeling that your closest friends are drifting away from you, and the friends that were... a bit more distant, are getting even more distant..... and that there are only like... two people you can really truly call friends anymore?  

I hate this feeling.  I don't know if it's that usual paranoia that everyone gets, or if I'm changing and everyone's drifting away....  a lot of people are saying and doing things towards me that they never would have before...things that bother me...  and I'm not quite forward enough to do anything but bear it in silence and pretend it doesn't bother me...  *sighs*

God what the hell's going on?  It's not like I've been ANGST!y lately... I've been more myself lately than ever before.... if my friends are drifting away because I'm being more myself... would that make it my fault?  * sighs * I don't know.  I'm not sure I want to."

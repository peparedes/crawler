"event","Been rereading ""Bleach"" from the beginning since the whole Ichigo might be a Quincy has left me with a case of what the fuck. It's cool to see the gang again before the current arc of annoyance.

The newest chapter introduces the Zero Division who appear to be a bunch of asses. They took Rukia, Renji, Byakuya and also Ichigo's Zangetsu. They want Ichigo to meet the King. And, I'm annoyed. I like the series but flesh out the characters we already have not keep adding new ones. It takes away from the plot where every new arc there's ten million new characters just waiting for you."

"event","I got caught up with several manga. 

Bleach - Ichigo is somehow related to Juhabach through his mother. I'm thinking Juhabach is his grandfather since (I hope) he's clearly Isshin's son. It would make more sense with that being the case since Ichigo has soul reaper abilities inherited from his dad and not full blown Quincy powers. Than again, who knows. I am going to have to reread the chapters leading up to this encase I missed something. And, I really hope it's not the last time we see Byakuya. 

Toriko - The boys combined their hunger power to defeat the legendary beast. The whole world parties like it's 1999. Teppei's head and fingers were on a bowl of fruit in the previous chapter which made me uneasy since he ran into this mysterious cloaked figure. Teppei wakes up and is completely healed by Pukin. She notes that his scar seemed to gotten bigger. Foreshadowing! Toriko notes to Rin that Terry's powers will evolve eventually and he created or mastered some new technique. Komatsu made it into the prestigious IGO Chef Ranking, now holding the rank of 88th best chef in the world. Some new characters makes his appearance and it looks like he know Komatsu. The mysterious cloaked figure goes back to the Gourmet Pyramid and notices something is missing. I'm assuming that's where he went.

One Piece - Finally got caught up. I cried when Ace died and cried with Brook told his story about the Rumbar Pirates. Well, I got teary eye. The Ace arc was just awesome and I actually became a huge fan of Crocodile because of it. Punk Hazard's arc is just very interesting. I like seeing how all the characters really have improved even though the Fishman Island arc kind of covered that. I just think you can really see them shine in the current arc. I really can't wait for this new arc to be finished."

But, I do have some stuff coming to me from ebay and thinkgeek. Got a huge bargain on ""Downtown Abbey"" both seasons. I paid $26.96 total with free shipping. I'm trying to locate ""Sherlock"" for Erin and maybe Cindy but I have to see if either or might like the awesome series. 

Still waiting word from Tom about the proposed party and gift ideas that Sum, Sheila and myself agreed on. Hopefully, we'll get an answer soon but i'm not sure if he got the email or anything. 

My Halloween quiz is completed and has been sent to my coworkers. I doubt that anyone will do it but it kept me busy. Now, I need to find something else to occupy my time here at work. Maybe, I'll just do another safety quiz for winter but start it early or a newsletter like the dealers have for safety. Something or i'll go insane. 

This Thursday night, Beth invited Cindy, Lou, Tom and myself for dinner and a bonfire. So excited! Maybe, I can see Erin and play with the puppy. Friday is horror night! Sheila, Erin, Tom (if he's not working) and myself are going for some Halloween fun. :D"

I'm still giddy about the new Silent Hill coming out. Erin and I are plotting dinner, haunted house and seeing the movie. I'm trying to get more people into going who want a good scare. Erin and I are also plotting a day when we can get together again with Cindy and Beth (her mom)to do something. I thought apple picking might be fun and I've never done it. I guess we'll see. I might just see if Cin wants to do it since all our days don't really mesh and we just go together on a Thursday before she gets her granddaughter."

"event","I watched the last anime episode of Bleach a few days ago. It was bittersweet. The anime has finally caught up to the manga even with the filler arc. From my understanding it will continue once the manga gets a bit further since you can only have so many filler arcs (looking at you Naruto). 

Anyway, I really did like it even though I wanted more since I'm such a huge fan of the series. I really like how all the captains really felt like shit on how they lied to Ichigo but was generally a) happy he was okay and b) excited that he was going to continue to help them. I also like watching the credits and seeing all the characters interact in soul society. Plus, having all of Ichigo's friends and family welcome him home. 

It's on youtube so check it out if you like. I'm still excited that we finally get to see head captain's bankai. And, omfg, is it powerful."

"event","Last week, I went home to celebrate my birthday and my mom's birthday. I wanted to do something nice for my sister who was picking me up and for my mom. I ended up baking three things. Two from scratch and one from a box.

I found a million recipes and several that I wanted to do. But, i'm not really baker and the only things I can make brownies, cookies and cake from following instructions on a box. I never done anything homemade before and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. 

I originally tried to make several batches of peanut butter cookies with two batches being thrown away. The first one, I end up burning it but it came out good. The second became powered dough cookies. I was discouraged since cookies were really easy to make or so I thought. I ended up browsing and found this blog that the blogger made peanut butter oero cookie bars (http://picky-palate.com/2012/08/27/oreo-chocolate-chip-peanut-butter-bars/). It looked easy and it was. 

I didn't have crushed oreos so I had to use the regular size. I looked everywhere in walmart but was on a time crunch. I did my best in making them smaller but some pieces were bigger than others. I also added chocolate chips in the mix. My mom and sister loved them. 

I also did make a batch of peanut butter cookies and a sugar free cake from a box. I still need work on baking cookies and want to try more baking. With holidays coming up, I have a good excuse for baking.

She's a vegetarian, doesn't like cilantro and fennel, no food allergies and likes sweet & savory. So, I'll just have to do some research since I have until the 15th to send it out. I was thinking of sending her some Japanese candy and doing a theme box along those lines and include an anime postcard or even some cute chopsticks. 

In case, you're curious about this. I joined this from a post I saw on ""ADIML"" here on lj. You submit your name and on the 5th of every month you get a pen pal and someone else will send you something. You spend $15 and ship it by the 15th of the month with a handwritten note. On October 1, we will upload our pictures of what we got on the site.

It seems fun. Might get some new pen pals and get some new food to sample."

Been reading ""The Friendly Winter"" on a whim. It's really good. The past few chapters with the recent one made me cry. SO sad. I really hope things get better for the main characters or just that they can resolve the issues from the past.

Also started this series called ""Kongou Banchou"" and it wasn't something that I thought I would enjoy. I was dead wrong. It is so good. I'm enjoying this series. I would pick it up if it got ported here and I hope they do a anime series of it. It's a fighting series but really hilarious at times. I'm just waiting for the new chapter to come out. 

I started a few romance ones including some cute yuri and yaoi. I prefer yaoi though. The romance in them just feels more real than the yuri that I read. It could just be me. 

And, my collection of manga has increased. I finished Imadoki! which was a cute fluff romance series. ALice 19th volume 6 will make this another series completed as will Suikoden volume 8 which I owned but who knows where it is. Kare Kano has taken a back seat but I'm missing like 4 or 5 volumes to finish it. Count Cain is missing two to complete. But, I started buying Snow Drop which is the only manga I have read a million times over at Sheila's place."

The upstairs neighbors were having some sort of Olympics. I decided to see a movie to just get out of the house. Tom wanted to go but see something different and in the end we saw a movie together. I had wanted to see the ""Expendables 2"" after reading Bluepunk's post and I enjoyed the first one. Tom didn't want to see it but mentioned the new Will Ferrell movie called ""The Campaign"" and I knew nothing about it.

Tom: It has baby punching.
Me: I'm in. :D

OMFG. I laughed so loud to the point where I almost had tears. It was that funny. Only one part made me cringe but it was a great comedy. The trailers were a hit and miss. There was the standard PG-13 horror movie I might see. ""Argo"" was one I want to see and there was another about a phone sex line that peeked my interest. Can't remember it's name. :/

But, I'm so telling Cin and Beth they need to see this movie. The last movie we saw was a horrible PG-13 horror movie that ended up like a MST3K episode."

Join us in standing up for reproductive health and education. Planned Parenthood, the organization that delivers reproductive health care, sex education and information to millions of people worldwide, has come under fire in the U.S. lately, with many politicians on both state and federal level seeking to end funding (and in a few cases succeeding).

During the month of May, you can <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/shop/vgift.bml?cat=charity"">send a specially designed Planned Parenthood vgift</a> to your friends to help support this cause. (And if you need someone to send it to, <lj user=""frank"" /> is always happy to receive gifts!) There are three variations ($1, $5 and $10) for you to choose from, but they&#39;d all look good on your profile when your friends know that you stand by something so important.

I have mixed feelings.  Overrated is the word that generally comes to mind.  I enjoyed the book but because I already like these characters.  As a single book, there are lots of things it could've done without.  I'll reserve judgment on those things until the movies are done, and if I actually read the rest.

Clarified a few things from the movie which satisfied my curiousity and way beyond.

I find myself thinking Hogwarts is low on extra-curriculars."

The first I've read of the series.  I prefer the punch of the movie to the slap of the book, but I found it an enjoyable read overall.  Mainly I was catching up on some characters after seeing the latest movie.  Just started the 4th book to help me keep all the new characters straight and to see what was cut for time."

"event","""Little Girl Lost"" by Drew Barrymore with Todd Gold (+)

Todd isn't a contributing writer in the usual sense.  It's more you read what Drew wrote and then there's a font and margin shift when he's filling in background and creating transitions.  It works some places better than others.  When it's more him than him relating things her mom said, I don't much care for it.  But then he was a staff correspondent for People magazine so what can you expect.

Her story is really interesting.  The book came out when she was 15 and mainly covers her descent to alcoholism and drug addiction and then rehab from ages 9 to 14.  Pretty amazing she pulled her life back together."

"event","latest health update:
mild form of anxiety and fleeting moments of unhappiness caused by symptons of situational claustrophobia. 
general shittiness and consequencial lack of wanting to make much speech of any real form inflicted from brief relationshipal idiocy.
change of eye shape from round to square from too much dvd viewing. 
slow depletion of brain cells continuing from december. soon to be repremanded once university stops being uninspiring and generally lacking in work. 
prediciting to regret above statement in the future.
so clean bill of insanity as always.
despite sounding as crap as that did. i am happy. sort of. im just in that crap 'in transit' stage where i dont want to be here or there or anywhere and im cursing how i managed to organise my life into sections which dont match. where what makes me happy in one spot cant and probably wont ever be in the same spot as the other things which make me happy. 
i should stop over analysing thing. the freshers are cool. met a few. knew a few. one from primary school actually. crazy miniscule world we live in. been a bit of a hermit now that most of us live on the same floor. i get to keep driving sarah around now that shes in a cast and crutches. curses on crutches. i always seem to end up with neighbours on crutches. made my first trip to the emergency ward for 2007. haha. good times.
awesome."

"event","also.
when you are a doctor. in a hospital. and you tell me you dont have the right equipment here and i will probably have to come to your practice another day.
that is very encouraging. 
and then when you come at me with your pen instead.
that makes me feel fan-fucking-tastic.
finally, when you open a drawer. in the doctors office of the hospital. note: DOCTOR. and HOSTPIAL. and there is the equipment you needed in the first place. 
well it shows you really looked hard. i would have looked there first. it doesnt take a medical degree to open a drawer does it?
be there OR be square. not both.

"event","i was just going to write the average, run of the mill, type post but i just realised its been almost exactly a year since we moved here. so i figured it would be a decent a point as any take stock of my life for the past year. in list-like form as i enjoy a good list.
 - moved to narrandera.
 - made zilcho friends.
 - worked at bilo.
 - still had the equivalent of zilcho friends.
 - had first christmas without my sister. it was crap. 
 - spent three months depressed, missing friends, talking to the dog way too much, shit scared about uni, working and spending time with the folks. i hated it but am better for it.
 - uni and college came around. life became perky once more.
 - decided psych was bullshit and political science was my new focus.
 - met lots of people who influenced me and made life smile-able.
 - namely (in brief) the girls, marky, the tamworth people (erin, v and 219), college people in general.
 - realised that i am shit with money. and i need to work all the time. to buy alcohol and clothes (which is to live really). 
 - became 'independent'. i get anxious when i have to depend on people too much. catch 22 with cars and money but.
 - my new realisation that the gold coast is pretty lame. but tweed is still my home. and thats mostly due to the people (ash, alex, karlee, daniel etc, and family). 
 - computers drive me insane. i hate them. 
 - im going to save for a car. my goal is to get one in time for graduation (haha, lame i know, but ive never actually decided to do save for a car. never cared enough.)
 - i still haven't discovered what i am a genius at yet. nor what im massively passionate about. well i might have. but i need to look into it more and i'll get back to you. im still just average academically.
 - im 18 now. in fact im more leaning towards 19 now. scary. 
 - ive been alot of places this year. and still managed to pass everything pretty well. and i still have a job. and friends. i even managed to hunker down a man haha. (its odd, not including new years, if all goes well, we will have reach four months or something yet seen eachother for a few days. lol.i dont think it counts really.)
 - so im back in narrandera. happier. working. travelling. new doggie. things to look forward to. (still zilcho friends here. although, most people at work know where i disappear to and ask me about it. and some of the girls look at me and say 'have you been away or something? i havent seen you for a while'. yeah, about six months haha)

over and out."

"event","and just a quick note to let you know that i am once again procrastinating.
death to sociology.
and the futile pursuit of knowledge. or at least the futile pursuit of someone patting me on the head telling me how smart i am. it will never happen. and i will spend my life killing time waiting for something better to happen. that and making to-do lists.
to do: live life.
i know where i want to be. and what i want to do. but i have no idea how to get there. im trying. but im constantly thinking that im not going about it right, i went to the wrong place, doing the wrong degree, not being focused enough. distractions is what i love. they stop me from realising that this could be a mistake. 
but boy stuffing up is fun.
i wouldnt swap it for the world. 
you will have to pry my hands off the door frame to ever get me to leave here before i have to. 
im sheltered here. and i love it.

random but true.
i figured that i should just alert my journal to this fact.
im not only alive, but im also procrastinating.
yep. last assignment of the year. and i am still acting like im playing hide and seek with it, and winning. i should really stop kidding myself.
the weather here has been decidedly awesome. in theory that is. its rained. all day. everyday. and yet, im slightly annoyed. out of character i know, rain is at the top of the list for me when it comes to 'things i like'. but its really starting to inconvenience me. i need to do stuff. like go out tomorrow and get drunk at the races. and i cant very well do that if its raining now can i.
oh how my priorities rock.
this past week has been a massive rollercoaster of mixed emotions - happiness, fear, confusion, guilt, excitment, nervousness...
its been pretty draining too.
thankfully, its distracted me from the fact that exams are soon. god forbid i would actually acknowledge them sooner than i had to. ie the day before.
hugs are good.
very good.

We looked at schools.
We went to the Impy.
We played two games of pool.

<p>wednesday. socy lecture and tute. the unit is all about crime and devience and has a really cool co-ordinator who is also our tute leader. i would say she is quirky, easy going and with cool taste in shoes. also had linguistics lecture. we have brett baker again...mr mono-tone voice. always makes me sleepy. but its kinda interesting. all about the formation of sounds, as in the various parts of the mouth and tongue and what touches what and&nbsp;where. lol. its pretty good. we went to the stro that night. well a few of us..most of the college didnt want to. but it was awesome to catch up with ben and scott and scott again. and all the various people sarah kept draggin up to me us lol.<br /><br />thursday, today. realised i didnt have anything til 3pm (once tutes start i will have a one pm start on thursdays which is still incredibly awesome!!! i love my timetable!). so i slept in. or tried to. except mark came in for a chat and then daniel turned up so they all sat down and had a merry old chat while i was half asleep in bed. thanks guys. got up. had lunch. sat around with the girls til about 2. decided i should think about going to linguistics at some stage. went to the lecture. was very bored for fifty mins. came back. watched some chaser haha love that show so much. had dinner. played pool. took beth to the kilda with daniel. got some late night food. came back. had a nesquik gathering in my room with dan mark sarah and sarah. watched eurotrip with them. fell asleep in the process. woke up and came on here.&nbsp;<br /><br />thats pretty much it. not sure what the plan is for the weekend. maybe pub bus to uralla. maybe not. maybe newie. maybe not. it all really depends on saturday and the funeral and everyone. so yeah.&nbsp;<br /><br />had an awesome phone call to ash this arvo!!!<br /><br />so yep. hope you all had a good night! all three of you who read this..if its even that many lol</p>"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""My bitch for the evening..."">Dear un-nameable Bilo worker, <br />Congradulations. You succeeded in making me very angry tonight, something which is not easily done unless you are a computer. <br />Right from the start of my shift, when you turned up an hour early for yours, and proceeded to hang around my register telling me what to do, you annoyed the heck out of me. Telling me to go get the trolleys so you dont have to when you start your shift, to my face, did not help much. Just a hint for next time - try to be a little more subtle when your bossing people around. <br />And last time i checked, you were in no way superior to me. You dont get paid more, you dont have a fancier title, so just because your older than me doesnt give you the right to tell me what i should be doing all the time. In fact, i think that because i have worked here longer than you, it would put me slightly above you in terms of authority. <br />But i dont work that way. I tried to be nice when you went off for a chat to your friends in the liquor section, or when you told me numerous times how ""we"" had to face up the first two aisles by six (and i stress the WE because obviously, to you, that means ERIN). <br />You know, I was warned about you. I shook it off as idle gossip when they said you were a pain to work with. But no. They weren't exaggerating at all. <br />And another thing, when i have a stack of customers at my register, and i call you for assistance, try not to take so long to get there. I know its a bit of a trek from <strike>stacking boxes&nbsp;</strike> sitting on your arse out the back, but it doesnt take so long that by the time you get there, your assistance isnt required anymore.&nbsp;<br />Its good i dont hold grudges. In fact i think im almost over it. But dont take offence if i answer your, if i may, patronising comments very blunty and then walk away.&nbsp;<br />Because frankly my dear, i dont give a damn.<br />Sincerely,<br />Erin.<br /><br /></div>"

i got four credits for first semester = happy erin.

ive spent the past night/day playing a game i found on the abc website called Kafkamesto. its based on the writings of Kafka. very philosophical. tedious and frustrating. i think the aim is to find a way to 'get better' both physically and mentally. there are various different endings, however all end in death except for one, and that is to escape the society. kind of like 1984 - death is freedom. its a definate looker, although i had to look up the cheats (i know...i give up too easily).

mum and i spent the afternoon organising outfits for college. so many functions...not enough pretty dresses! and no real desire to spend money.. mum has lent me a dress she used to wear..you know..back then..which is really awesome! so saved a few dollers there. and i found this other dress in the back of my wardrobe that ive never worn (seans mum gave it to me..) and i tried it on. it looked pretty good so i think im going to wear that to valedicts. and ive had ball organised for ages. 

next term will be, in a word, exciting!

daniel is coming. yay! its going to be strange seeing him everyday. its kind of your dream to be able to spend everyday with your bestfriends. but i dont know. it could be a bad thing. hope not..
it'll be good to see him again anyway. yes..thats definately going to bring a smile to my face! 

hopefully seeing da vinci code tonight. its still on at leeton. in fact i think it only opened this week. haha yes you'd think there was a two month time difference when you get more than 600km inland. a tinsy bit slow around here...

"event","it has become increasingly obvious that me and my sister are no longer the children in this family. and i am especially no longer the baby of the family. there are two (people) who have taken our places. in terms of care and attention, we have become merely observing adults. our siblings (or our dogs to be correct) have become accustomed to a lifestyle which is rather reminiscent of my childhood and times in the family home. 
breakfasts of warm milk. hundreds of toys scattered throughout the house. sibling rivalry. beds with awesome blankets (i've bought one for uni). designated cuddles sessions. daddy's little boy and mummy's little girl. freshly cooked meals. photo after photo to capture the special moments and cute poses. 
perhaps my parents tried the 'birds have flow the nest' stage that all parents must go through. they dipped their toes into this new lake of life and decided the water was too cold right now. 
so they added another dog to the clan.
and it seems im not immune to the puppy dog eyes either. my little brother and sister would have to be the worlds greatest experts at the pathetically gorgeous 'love me' looks. your heart melts.

pols was good. better than expected. the exact same paper as last year (was a fairly easy going year too). 
i would say there is about 20 or 25 people left. maybe. the majority of who is left are leaving tm. so that leaves me chole benny kelwin pen keno...i cant remember who else. so it shouldnt be all that bad. 
angie is going well..a bit of a cold but thats expected.
george had a big clean out today. a bit of packing. lost quiet a bit of weight and is now looking trim and tidy.

"event","i miss dancing.
i watched billy elliot today and it just made me realise how awesome it is to be able to dance. as much as it used to annoy me, i really miss going to class and seeing everyone and doing ballet...each week for 12 years. thats ages. no wonder i miss it. it was such a huge chunk of my life. the music..the words..the movements. i want that. it used to give me a little secret feeling of accomplishment..it was my thing - dancing. none of my other friends did it really. and when people told me they could tell i did ballet just from the way i walked..that made me happy. i dont know why because really they are saying i walk with a pole up my arse but i think yeah..i made that happen. and it kinda just became a part of my subconscious. these little things i never realised i did were because of ballet. i used to seriously think i would finish year ten and then try out for QDSE in brisbane and do senior years there. haha i was never that good or anything. but i dreamed that my life would always revolve around ballet..basically. and i realised the obvious today..that it doesnt. apart from the occasional dancing movie or the 'yeh i did dancing too' or when i have the sudden urge to bust out a pirouete or even just pointe my toes. ballet doesnt really have anything to do with me anymore. if you told that to a ten year old me..it would make me cry. for an 18 year old me to realise it..the reaction is the basically the same."

here are some lyrics from some songs that i happen to think are alright...

1)on the stereo, listen as we go, nothings gonna stop me now.
2)if you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says.
3)feel myself heading underground, im scared im not comin down.
4)trying to make ends meet, your a slave to money, then you die.
5)if only i could be as cool as you.
6)where were you while we were getting high?
7)i said to the man are you trying to tempt me? because i come from the land of plenty.
8)im fed up. im tired of waiting on you.
9)but only in my dreams did that wall between us come undone.
10)its such a feeling that, my love, i can't hide.
11)im practising your name so i can say it to your face.
12)theres no rhyme, theres no reason, your the secret in the back of my skull.
13)i want you, i want you, i want you, so bad.
14)do you ever stop and wonder, where you'd be without her?
15)well its alot like dying, a lot like trying, all my friends are misunderstood.
16)so if your lonely, you know im here waiting for you.
17)i never got cold wearing nothing in the snow.
18)and i have to speculate, that god himself did make us into correspoding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay.
19)theres beauty in the breakdown.
20)i get knocked down, but i get up again, your never gonna keep me down.
21)if it can be fused then it can be split, its all under control.
22)save tonight and fight the break of dawn.
23)restless future burning bright.
24)when i was a kid i grew up in a house on a hill.
25)i dont know how much i can take, girl give me something i can break.
26)i love the sound of you walking away.
27)phoney beatle mania, has bitten the dust.
28)in the paper today, tales of war and of waste, but you turn right over to the tv page.

"event","im just being to realise just how silly i am. and its not just once or twice. its every weekend. regularly. 
saturday night is our going out and getting smashed night. sure thats silly, but in a good way (if thats even possible?). last night was definately no exception. went to a party with bec erin and lauren, met lots of people, drank, spilt, laughed...
im kind of glad thats a regularity actually. its a nice release from the college 'institutionalised' life..at least it can seem that way sometimes. 
here is where the silliness really comes into play..
at some stage during the week i usually volunteer to help out clare at MB sports on sundays. and each time i do this, my mind must conveniently forgot to remind me that these MB sports usually start at 8 or 9am and that everytime i do go, i feel really really under par from the night before. but no, my mind stays blank so i smile, and nod 'yes, i can be up by 8 on sunday morning'....i never get up before 10 normally.
so i go out..have fun..come home..
then i drag myself out of bed early, and feel exceptionally seedy. every sunday.
maybe its subconscious punishment. 
and another thing..is it not ironic, that the only time i wear a uniform these days is on a sunday??"

"event","well..
we just had our guest speaker dinner which in short, was awesome!
but just quickly..
i got my poltical science essay back and got a HD which im really happy with (duh)and i guess re-affirms my decision to change degrees. I also got my socy essay back with a pass (meh), but at least im on par with everyone else (a pass was average mark). And finally i got my linguistics assesment back with a credit so on the whole im happy with that.
My major assesments:
psyc (yukky) - pass
socy (yukky but interesting) - pass
ling (challenging but interesting) - credit
pols (my fave) - high distinction

Now i just have exams to think about.

so tonight was definately worth braving the cold.
got all dolled up (plenty of pics on msn space) and went to dinner (after a finishing off my bottle of midori). dinner was yum! and we got good-ish wine for once too. but the highligh for sure, was the speech. it was by an ex-duvalian (richard hicks) who is now an international consultant in bosnia and has worked in numerous countries which are in need of humanitarian aid. his speech was all about afghanistan, the real situation, the affects of the americans, the general stupidity of americans, the questionably affectionate foriegn policy of aust with america, his work with rural developement in afghanistan, corruption, bribery, humanitarian aid...it was incredible really. it sort of gave me that little bit more of motivation or inspiration to focus what im doing here for something bigger. it gets hard to see all this uni stuff in correspondance with the wider picture, the future. 
truely worthwhile."

im actually about to steal about half of beths music while shes at touch, mainly because she has the amelie album and i love that movie so damn much (pen has a copy so we're watching it later tonight...so excited, ive been complaining heaps lately about how i miss being able to watch it whenever i want.).
today was average so i wont go into details. im still alive so i guess thats the main thing hehe. 
block dinner is on tomorrow night, D/E is going with L which is completely random but so perfect (most of my friends are in L block) so we should be in for an awesome time!!
in my pols tut this afternoon i had one of those moments you see in movies, where a person sees a bird flying so free and they suddenly decide they would give anything to be that bird. i saw it, and really honestly wished that could be me. it was odd. but cool.

"event","so here is my post for the past few days...
the week was rather average, class was class etc etc
watched the footy on weds night(GO BLUES!!), awesome second half. didnt buy any drinks as i have very little money, that was also partly my reason for not going to the stro after..and partly because it was about -3 degrees and it was late enough that i would have had to pay to get in (the stro just isnt THAT great...especially if your not going to drink) and partly because i was just too buggered anyway. 
friday i went to the student centre to hand in the forms they gave me about changing degrees and got that all sorted yay!
friday night was very random indeed. hung in becs room playing board games as it was again too incredibly cold to do much else (gee i go on about the weather a bit dont i?). unfortunately team erin&bec lost miserably to sarah&grathman in crainuim haha but bec i will never forget your attempt to hum puff the magic dragon to me..and the rest of the world won't either seeing as sarah got it all on her camera hehe! after numerous games of cluedo we decided to go to beths and give me a make over. so i got my hair straightened and make up done..what girl doesnt enjoy that? and then me and beth went nuts with the camera (i put all the pics up on my msn space), and then me and sarah woke bec up and went nuts with the camera again (gosh sounds a bit sordid doesnt it?). then me and sarah sat up watching episodes of america's next top model.
saturday i got up to watch bec play netball, we met becs parents (we now see where bec gets her increible personality traits from..). went shopping with patts and mark for block function deocrations. decorated for block function (80's theme). drank (goon and pepsi..ironic as i can't stand the taste of either drinks, so why on earth did i think that by mixing them together they would somehow taste good?? haha and why would anyone do that anyway...ever)so mark gave me bundy and cola instead. got dressed for block function (again, pics on msn space). attended block function. got rather drunk. sat on marks floor babbling on the phone to an equally drunk bec (i cant even remember why). had trouble getting off marks floor to get changed for the pub. had even more trouble trying to get the key in the lock on my door. somehow got changed. talked about well nothing really (as in 'drunk talk') with mark and kayla waiting for pub bus. got waaay to excited to see that second courtyard was coming on the same bus as us, hence my massive bear hug/tackleling of beth as she got on the bus. sang numerous pub bus songs (gotta love those lyrics). went to uralla. had jelly shots. sobered up a bit. danced. got back on the bus. went to the newy. got less sober. dancing chatting etc..i think. saved bree from some guy who was groping her on the dance floor. came back. had a bit of sleep.
was woken up way too early considering the night before and the time i went to bed lol. did time keeping and sand-rakeing at the athlectics carnival, was quite good once it warmed up a bit. slept on and off through the day, just relaxing really.
count down to exams: 18 days
more importantly...
countdown to home: 30 days"

"event","well the last few days in no real order...
yesterday or most of it anyway, was possibly the worst day ive has since being here (with the exception of maybe one). and looking back it wasnt even that bad...little things count big in reflection i guess.  
but for re-counts sake - got up late. felt icky in genral. and you know that feeling (please someone agree with me because the last lot people i tried to explain it too just looked at me strange..)when you just feel odd. as in physically awkward...almost like the act of walking is making you stand out like a sore thumb. i compare it to a comment someone made to me recently - i feel shorter today for some reason. its like that.
anyway, feeling like your walking with clown shoes on for the twenty minutes it takes to get to uni is rather depressing. 
then after getting a little lost in the (incredibly new and fancy looking) education building i managed to find the right theatre for the political discussion and forum day. it was cool seeing all the politicians arriving in their suits - the air of supieriority followed them like a bad perfume hehe. 
but unfortunately (although rather predictibly) my eye lids decided they weight 20kgs each and kept wanting to shut. so the countdown to the mid morning break became a fight to see whether i could outlast my battle with my eyes. i won, but not without a death stare from my pols lecturer who could see my struggle (i had the same fight a few days before in his tut, in which i was only one of four students and as such was quite obvious i needed sleep).
i left and went to meet beth for our weds lunch break at the uni cafe..only to find her lecture had been cancelled and so she went back to college. 
so i had a hour to kill before psyc, so i decieded on coffee and a walk back to duval to wake me up a bit. half way there i realised (embarrassingly) that the entire time, my coffee had been leaking down my jacket. feeling stupid and annoyed i decided that the only thing that would make me calm down (i was getting a bit frazzled and wanted to avoid an emotional outburst like tears etc) would be to sit in the incredible park on the hill up to college and listen to my newly named 'deep breathing' music - select songs from garden state album. 
i had been eyeing off the park ever since i moved here (its so so big...all grassy...trees everywhere..make you feel as if you could be anywhere). 
and ironically, i was determined to finish every last drip of that wretched coffee because i spent my last three dollars on it and i wanted my monies worth.
so there i was, sitting, drinking and listening. and msging various people. one in particular was ben (mate from wright village) to tell him i was having a crapper of a day and was going to give myself the afternoon (or at least psyc) off. and (and this was one of the 'little good things' that makes the rest of the shit seem small) he decided to come sit with me instead of going to psyc because he could tell i was that annoyed. i appreciated that so much..cause he really didnt have to, but his concern was..comforting?.
so we ended up sitting in the sun talking for an hour maybe two which was really nice and definately calmed me down lol.
and then we headed off to socy via the psyc building to pick up our essays (gulp). god i really dislike psyc. i got 57% as in 57 out of 100. as in a 'pass'. i tell you what, if i actualy cared about psyc then i would have been pretty shattered. although everyone did really average accross the board so its not like i was exceptionally crap. 
i think thats basically where the crap stuff ended. 
went to polo dinner that night (polo = the girls club at college where you go to out dinner, get pissed, and basically tell anyone whos present the details of your sex life...at least the returners who go did, the freshers just sat there and laughed/cringed). i was dd. however i was still dragged (ok so walked) from one side of the town to the other looking for a bottlo so they could drink. i wouldnt have cared except that i was wearing my pj's (im not a freak - it was the theme for the polo dinner..had to wear your pj's), so the embarrassment of that didnt add much to the day's luck. 
got back to college fairly early so we could get changed to go to the stro. it ended up being pretty awesome from then on. possibly due to the fact that i decided i would get smashed (i felt i deserved it) haha. it wasnt really intentional, but everyone knows how big a fan i am of double blacks and it doesnt take many to get me gone. the dj rocked, played lots of random stuff like bernad fanning and ben lee, loveshack, ymca, my schoolies anthem, my madonna songs...
the walk back after close was the most long/stupid/hilarious thing ive done in ages. think a group of rather drunk people, freezing whether, leaf angels, leaf fights, leaf tackles and various other leaf related activites...
me, sarah harrison and mitch decided to crash at bens place at wright village for a change from college. it was good fun..fell asleep watching hackers, slept on the lounge/floor (ooh just like the holidays haha i love sleeping on the floor!!).
mitch went back to college at somestage during the night though. 
got up real late, slight hangover but nothing major. 
came home. cleaned my room. bludged. watched chicago and fell asleep again. 
thats about it. 
will (if i dont forget) go see the student centre tomorrow about changing degrees.
and dropping psyc...YAY!!"

"event","""No Bravery""

There are children standing here,
Arms outstretched into the sky,
Tears drying on their face.
He has been here.
Brothers lie in shallow graves.
Fathers lost without a trace.
A nation blind to their disgrace,
Since he's been here.

And I see no bravery,
No bravery in your eyes anymore.
Only sadness.

Houses burnt beyond repair.
The smell of death is in the air.
A woman weeping in despair says,
He has been here.
Tracer lighting up the sky.
It's another families' turn to die.
A child afraid to even cry out says,
He has been here.

And I see no bravery,
No bravery in your eyes anymore.
Only sadness.

There are children standing here,
Arms outstretched into the sky,
But no one asks the question why,
He has been here.
Old men kneel to accept their fate.
Wives and daughters cut and raped.
A generation drenched in hate.
Says, he has been here.

And I see no bravery,
No bravery in your eyes anymore.
Only sadness.

this is a song by james blunt which my pols lecturer was talking about today...the film clip is just pictures from the war, i just googled it...its pretty incredible

lifes slow but good
polo dinner and stro tm night...da vinci code on fri...block function next weekend...easy mac and movies night with ben beth n sarah soonish...political science day tomorrow where there is heaps of lectures by senators, mps, proffessors etcs - im looking forward to it

and i think ive worked out what i want to do after uni...first travel anywhere and everywhere...and then apply for a graduate program with a gov dept..family services, community and aboriginal affairs to be exact. i know that seems odd after posting anti-war/gov lyrics but i guess politics is just something im inclined to (fascinates me...i think i owe most of that to daniel and the past 6 years of heated conversations and explainations...i had a bit of trouble understanding alot of the policies etc but then again who does really know whats going on in their minds sometimes???). so i figure i may as well use this interest and go into the public service...my little attempt at making the world a better place..and grass roots - families and indigenous affairs. yeah thats the plan."

"event","do you know that feeling..when there is nothing you need to do? and there are no pressures hovering over you? and your feeling good? i have that feeling. 

i finished my last assignment at 11.30 this morning. now i have about four weeks til exams, which i am nervous about but they're too far away to care right now. And i had a pretty good day. Went to class, left class. ate dinner, left dinner. got a movie, watched movie. (anchorman...was very good!!)

and now everyone is at touch footy - i decided not to go as im recovering from a tiny cold. im just lying on my bed, bludging on the internet..myspace etc (stuff you do when there is nothing else to do). but its awesome you know? its so good to just relax...by myself...for a bit. catching up on emails. listening to random bands on myspace (Plain White T's...not bad, not bad at all). my bed has never felt so comfy. and for once im not cold haha yeah! 
i think maybe the combination of a cold, massive essay and lots of emotional d&m's with people was just getting to me and i got a bit frazzled. but now everything is sorted and im feeling alot better.

lifes good i guess.

and i can't wait to go home these holidays..im not homesick because this place is now really my home, but i just want to be back in the 'family home' with mum and dad and ash and the puppies. it hasnt really been like that since year 11. thats so long! im just really excited. could i even say that i miss narrandera?? maybe. as hard as it was to be at, its a special place. i think i did alot of growing up there. im the better for it anyway. so im looking forward to that heaps!

i think thats all thats really going on with me just now.
whats going on with you? :-P"

"event","just excuse me for a moment...im about to have the biggest bitch about something...

i just spent the last hour in a room with the worlds most stupid man. teaching the worlds most stupid subject. in the worlds most stupid temperature. it was stupid.

because of that one lecture, i have decided that i hate psyc...absolutely hate it...and want to...will attempt to..drop it next semester. i was going to ride it out til the end of the year but if its going to be like this then i dont give a damn. 

if you asked me the topic of the lecture, i dont think i could tell you. it was something about shapes and the whole concept (which is pretty duh anyway) of how even though two things are the same size, if one is a greater distance away from you than the other...they are going to look like different sizes. we've all seen the emails. its not that bloody hard to understand. so why then, did the stupid stupid man with the annoying american accent have to spend an entire hour explaining, no repeating, over and over again what was essentially the same thing. it drove me nuts. i wanted to strangle him. but it wasnt just that. it was the way he would try and make it look different everytime. first he would read a point off the screen. then explain it in his own words (with hand actions). then explain it with a diagram on the screen...and then run through the same diagram again. and then relate it back to this silly picture he must have come up with (i bet he was proud) of a road with a fence running alongside it. and then his last point..something about the moon..basically contradicted everything he had said before. and when my friend ben asked him about it all he could say was 'ah..umm..oh..' and then show us the stupid diagram with the road again. what any of this has to do with psychology i dont know. it probably does have some connection, but i wouldnt know, i hate it.

oh and the stupid man even made up his own 'ground breaking' theory which he didnt even explain but made sure we heard his cool name for it 'connecton theory'. he said that about 8 times too. 

and i swear, if they dont turn off the air conditioning in there soon, im taking a blanket, hot water bottle and a flask of rum to my next lecture. stupid people.

i feel better now.

hmm, also, i apparently always try to find the good in people. hey i'll claim that, i proud if thats how i come off to people. but...i'm told this isnt a good quality to possess. we need to find a happy median of finding the good and being cynical...apparently. yeah, lets all jump in the middle and be 'normal'. because where is the fun in being different? ;-P"

"event","just got back from the newy...had a pie and cup of tea with some people who decided to hang in my room. very very fun night!! dinner was tasty, pub was pretty much full and they were mostly college people. met a whole bunch more people i hadnt met yet..including another guy from wingham (i swear ash, these people must migrate from wingham to armidale...its almost odd!). waited outside in incredibly cold temperatures for mark to pick us up (which im really grateful for considering he didnt have to). we were almost worried at the amount of time it took him to come get us, until he told us that it was because he had to spend 15mins scraping the ice off his windscreen...ICE! already! i knew that happened here but its only may. and it was true..the car park was like iceland (theoretical not europe). this place really is incredible."

"event","well what a day! i got up much earlier than i needed. stumbled around college for awhile and then went down to watch duval play netball. it was simply thrilling haha and i was all ready to play soccer afterwards when...
bottom L sarah came over after subbing and sat with me and spectator mark and told us how much her arm hurt from when she fell over in first quarter. we looked at it and i swear it was almost double the size it should be poor thing, so we got some ice and decided to take her to emergency to make sure it wasnt anything too serious.
three hours of waiting rooms later...
shes ok. it was a something something fracture, fairly common, but shes gotta wear a sling for 4-6 weeks. lol and she felt much better after recieving some drugs...'i gotta say guys, these pain killers are some good shit'.
and now im just waiting to get ready for dinner and out-ting tonight for sare and holly's bdays. 
just quickly..special mention goes to mark for zinging me massivly today haha - on the way to the hospital, i was slightly bragging about how i've never broken anything before, and mark said 'yeah its cause you never do anything'...it was one of those 'its funny 'cause its true' situations...me and sport arent the best of friends. 
and i was also just thinking...
how awesome it is, being able to know so many people on so many levels. college gives you an opportunity to get to know people so much better than anything i can really imagine. for lack of a better adjective...i think its 'cool'.

'moshed' (haha) with beth, mark, lauren, sarah, lozza, bec, bec's very cool friend from oxley (also called erin), ben, and just lots of college people! was so so good...drunk=less...whatever...more fun basically. vanshe rocked! as did end of fashion. felt like crying the entire way home though. was it because i had no feeling left in my feet or body because it was so cold? or was it because things can be so fucked up in the most laughable ways sometimes? who knows. an interesting night? yes. worth it? possibly. would me and someone else ever want to think about it again? at this stage...doubtful. however despite how much alcohol i managed to consume tonight, im pretty sure i will remember it. hopefully tm's function will blast tonight into the endless abyss of my mind..."

"event","wow, so i fell asleep in political science letcure today...not surprising. but my socy tut was good! i had a few quote things that he gave us which really made me think. i was going to post them on here but i'll have to find them first. it was all about race and ethnicity. one was by this person called Thomas, and his theory was that if people define situations as real, then they are real in their consequences. i was a bit shocked because i was thinking about the whole issue of reality these holidays..whats real? whats not? etc. maybe oneday i'll have thought enough about it, and found enough theories and quotes and discussions that i'll be able to make a decision about what i think it is. 
another interesting thing i established today is that i am sub-consciously racist. (trust me, i didnt want to believe it either). its not like i was raised this way. i couldnt have been brought up in a more loving and accepting environment. but i guess society had a part in my upbringing as well. see, our tut leader asked us what would be our initial thought if we saw a drunk aboriginie in the street, as opposed to a drunk white person, and yep, as sad and ashamed as i was, i had to agree with him when he suggested 'stupid abo, see what alcohol does to them?'. but i tried (and still do) to convince myself that sure that is just my initial thought and that i almost always correct myself for thinking that way. its still sad though. i hope that eventually, i wont need to correct myself. 
so, tonight was fun...went to coles, beat beth at pool (yay!), hungout in J block visiting different people (that block is really cool!)..haha i beat kelwin at mortal combat!!! im told thats pretty good.
looking forward to tomorrow night!!
...but not tomorrow morning...
ohh pene told me to spread the word about this new band shes discovered, they're called 'the third cycle' and they are actually really awesome. a kind of mix between gwen stefani (during no doubt)and sarah blasko - the chicks voice has this endless sort of quality to it, and it manages to combine synthersizers and drumming in a really cool eclectic way and the guitar goes from gentle to pretty intense and back again...very interesting, not like anything much ive heard before (not that thats saying much). anyway..they only have a sample thing out now with three tracks, but they have a myspace site and if we can get enough interest going, pene might be able to get them to come play up here (their syd based)..so spread the word ok??!!
and my plug-listen to future kings of spain..i got hooked in the holies"

THe funny thing is is that it was a complaint against me under my maiden name...Which I haven't used in almost 3 YEARS.&nbsp; Anyway I just wanted to type some shit in order to get it off my chest. I found out that my daughter is partially deaf a while back so now we are trying this new drop. If that doesn't work they're going to do surgery. And if that doesn't work then we're going to have to buy her&nbsp;a hearing aid. Well that's it for now. I'll update more later.</p>"

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when everything is uncertain, one moment heaven... the next moment hell.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was ruthless, cold-blooded, and sarcastic.

Your ideal relationship is open. Both of you can talk about everything... no secrets.

Your risk of cheating is low. Even if you're tempted, you'd try hard not to do it.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

In this moment, you think of love as something you thirst for. You'll do anything for love, but you won't fall for it easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

"event","A lot has been said about how to prevent rape. Women should learn self-defense. Women should lock themselves in their houses after dark. Women shouldn't have long hair and women shouldn't wear short skirts. Women shouldn't leave drinks unattended. God, they shouldn't dare to get drunk at all.

Instead of that crap, how about:

If a woman is drunk, don't rape her. If a woman is walking alone at night, don't rape her. If a women is drugged and unconscious, don't rape her. If a woman is wearing a short skirt, don't rape her. If a woman is jogging in a park at 5AM, don't rape her. If a woman looks like your ex-girlfriend you're still hung up on, don't rape her. If a woman is asleep in her bed, don't rape her. If a woman is asleep in your bed, don't rape her. If a woman is doing her laundry, don't rape her. If a woman is in a coma, don't rape her. If a woman changes her mind in the middle of or about a particular activity, don't rape her. If a woman has repeatedly refused a certain activity, don't rape her. If a woman is not yet a woman, but a child, don't rape her. If your girlfriend or wife is not in the mood, don't rape her. If your step-daughter is watching TV, don't rape her.

If you break into a house and find a woman there, don't rape her. If your friend thinks it's okay to rape someone, tell him it's not, and that he's not your friend. If your ""friend"" tells you he raped someone, report him to the police. If your frat-brother or another guy at the party tells you there's an unconscious woman upstairs and it's your turn, don't rape her, call the police and report him as a rapist.

Tell your sons, god-sons, nephews, grandsons, and sons of friends that it's not okay to rape someone.

Don't just tell your women friends how to be safe and avoid rape. Don't imply that she could have avoided it if she'd only done/not done x, y, or z. Don't imply that it's in any way her fault. Don't let silence imply agreement when someone tells you he ""got some"" with the drunk girl. Don't perpetuate a culture that tells you that you have no control over or responsibility for your actions. You can, too, help yourself.

If you agree, repost it. It's important."

We have decided that we aren't going to go anywhere on Thanksgiving. SO for the first time in MY LIFE I'm going to spend it at home, and not in a car. It's gonna be nice. We decided not to make a turkey and the huge meal that usually accompanies it but to make a homemade pizza with our kids instead. Actually our kids will be making the pizza with daddy's supervision. We're gonna rent a few movies to watch and of course I'm going to watch the Lions get their asses kicked(which is nothing unusual). So yeah I'm actually excited about Thanksgiving, even though alot of our family members are pissed off about it but oh well. I guess that's all for now. I'll update sometime in the future."

They had to do a MRI(whatever) and then they made her do about a dozen or so tests to make sure she didn't suffer any brain damage. She was diagnosed with Strep Throat, so now I get to have loads of fun. However tomorrow night Jeremy and I are actually going out(if Mekala is feeling better) for the first time in 4 months. And that will be a nice break. Anyway I have to go and take her temp so I'll have to add more later."

"event","Today has been a shitty day thus far...Jeremy and I will be fighting as soon as he wakes up with hangover or no hangover because I don't care anymore. I'm so sick of this shit. He got drunk last night for the second time this week and then yesterday he insisted on staying up for 2 1/2 hours laying in bed trying to get me up to tend to our kids. When he could have just gotten his lazy ass out of bed and tended to them himself. But no he needs to annoy the hell out of me and then bitch at me because my kids are up with no supervision. I'm so aggrivated and annoyed with this shit. I'm beyond sick of it, I'm too the point that I'm wondering why we got married in the first place. I love him, I truly do but he can just be so inconsiderate and selfish it's not funny. Why can't he just help out once in awhile? Why can't he get up and tend to the kids for an hour or two? Why is it he gets 48 + hours of sleep a week and I only get 10-16 hours? Why can't he understand where I'm coming from? Am I truly being that undereasonable? I guess so. I'm being a spoiled little brat. Nothing more and nothing less...that's all there is to it I guess."

"event","Yesterday Mr. Phantom came to visit!!!! :P He kicks ass! He's so awesome(even though I had to wait for 2 1/2 hours for him :P) He's also better looking IRL, and his attitude is killer! He loved to squeal his tires, and got me in trouble with the park manager but oh well, shit happens.  My kids are still talking about him, non-stop, as well as my co-workers(who have started a rumor because of it). He probably thinks that I am completely insane(I guess I am in a way) and that my husband is really shy but we're not really. Anyway, he's probably regretting his trip up here but I'm glad he came. It's just shitty that he couldn't have stayed longer. Anyway I'll add more later."

"event","James is coming up here on Saturday!!! :) YEAAAAAAAAAAA!! Actually I'm a little nervous but extremely excited. Hopefully my house won't be completely trashed. But he's going to be here around 9 am and unless I receive a miracle my kids will be up and destroying my house at 7:30am. I guess I'll just have to wait and see, won't I?

We put in a new bathroom floor Monday. It's so nice. We no longer have plywood but really pretty green tiles. My kittens are raising hell, right along with my kids. But both of my girls(kids not cats) are feeling much better. That's such a relief. 

Stacy returned to work today. So far her first day back is going well. She hasn't flipped out, which she thought she would, yet. She has about 4 hours left of her shift but Jeremy's managing so it's no biggie.  They aren't really busy so she's not feeling the normal pressure which is definetly a bonus. I'm afraid that if they were busy she would have snapped by now but she's doing good. Everyone is extremely proud of her. She's still suicidal but now she's found a reason to continue living so hopefully that will keep her from attempting to kill herself. 

I'm so ready to go to work tomorrow. My kids, I love them more than words can describe, but they are driving me mad. I'm ready to strangle Mekala and tie up Jewels. Mekala won't hush up for even a second, she's been talking nonstop since 12:45pm(when I picked her up) and it's now what 6:15ish pm. Man I can't believe how much she can talk. Jewels on the other hand needs to have her hands either tied up or chopped off. She climbed up onto my kitchen counter today and got my wedding jewelry out of the cupboard. She broke my necklace and I'm not sure it can be fixed. I'm praying that it can otherwise I'll be devestated.

Anyway that's all for now. Have fun everyone and I'll update sometime"

Anyway, this week is starting off shitty as well. My grandfather had to have surgery yesterday. He has cancer and they found a lump that they had to go in and remove so hopefully all went well. I haven't heard from them yet so I'm assuming things went good but I'm not positive. We finally got our new computer hooked up(hence my week off). I am loving every second of it. It's 2 years old but my dad just gave it to us so it is especially useful. Mekala started school yesterday. I have to get her up by 6am every morning in order to meet the bus on time. That's a pain in the ass and somewhat annoying but it's better than having to drive her all the way to school. Now I have to drive 3 miles to her bus stop instead of the 20 miles to school. Yeah, now it won't cost me an arm and leg. Anyway that's all for now I guess."

Stacy will not be released from the Hospital until noon tomorrow and that's just so that she may go to her mothers funeral. They are undecided as to whether they will make her go for a psyc(sp?) exam. My kids are being horrid little brats that are doing nothing but arguing with each other and me...I'm ready to strangle them. Oh, and for the second time since we've been together my husband is sick! That poor guy doesn't ever get sick but when he does he gets nailed. He has a soar throat, sinus infection, his mouth hurts, a headache from hell and he can't hardle stand up straight because he's nasuea and dizzy. So, yeah for me...lots more fun. Jeremy gets to spend most of tomorrow sleeping and staying in bed. Whereas;I get to run around with my head chopped off to get ready for the funeral. Hopefully my kids will behave for him tomorrow while I'm gone otherwise I'll feel really bad. But that's all for now. Everyone have a great day!!"

I'm pushed beyond my emotional and physical limits at the moment and I still have to make it through Tuesday...at least until after the funeral and the wake...and to top it all off-I'm potty training Jewels, my house is a disaster area, my dad's coming over tomorrow and my niece will be staying the night tomorrow night, and I have to work at both jobs tonight. I have to go to Howard City on Monday and the funeral is on Tuesday...I have way too much shit to do. My laundry is piled up because I've been to depressed to do anything...at least my husband was nice enough to do the dishes Thursday otherwise those would be a mile high by now.

"event","Welll lets see...where should I begin. I will begin by thanking everyone for their condolences and their prays. But now just to prove that things can get worse...and I mean much worse I will begin by telling you about the day my friend had.

My friend Stacy, whom crashed at her cousins house last night, went home at 7am this morning to get ready for school. As she walked into her home she made a very upsetting discovery. She stumbled across her mother and step-fathers bodies. To make things all the worse it was ruled a murder/suicide. Now she's not a very stable person to begin with so I'm really really worried about her. I'm also scared shitless that she will commit suicide herself. She's already feeling extremely guilty about it and it's only getting worse. Right now I just don't know what to do. What really pisses me off is that they waited 11 hours before sedating her...how much fucking sense does that make? seriously, why would they let her go through that? The funeral isn't until Tuesday and some people say that I don't have the right to be there since I didn't know her mom or step-dad but I'm not going for them, I'm going for her. I'm afraid to just sit back and wait for her to come to me because I think she'll kill herself before any of that will ever happen. I won't be able to handle it, nor live with myself if that happens. She's barely 17...with no family left...

I apologize for my tyuping...I can't see very cleartly at this moment."

"event","Well tonight I received a call from my Superior and depending on how things work out I may end up being shipped down to New Orleans come next week. If I do go I'll be down there for 3 to 6 months. I'm more than willing to go, maybe I can even do some good.  Michigan is sending down all Naval Reserves they can spare...although most of us left work in recruiting offices. There's 13 of the 15 going from my office alone. But every little help we can provide is well worth it. I'll let everyone know what's going on come Monday morning.

I also learned today(well about an hour ago @ 10pm) that 4 of my relatives didn't make it. I'm upset and sadden but it's not affecting me the way it would if it was someone closer. I didn't know them that well, but still I did know them. My kids aren't affected by the news at all, they had never met them. It was my Cousin David and his family(Wife Nikko, daughter Megan and son David Jr.) His daughter was almost 4(her birthday was 2 days away) and his son was 22 months old. They shouldn't have died!!! There was no reason for them to die.

Well I'm done for tonight...I think I'm going to cry now and then get my thoughts together and get things around in case I get shipped out Monday. I'll keep everyone uptodate..."

"event","Well I got my eyes checked out and they haven't gotten much worse...if I didn't want a new perscription I wouldn't need to get it however...my stigmatism in my left eye has gotten worse so it would probably be a good idea...once we come up with the money. I can't believe how much it is going to cost me to get lenses for my frames. So far the cheapest I found them to be is $218.45 and that's getting a 15% discount since I have medicaid. I have only 2 more places to check before deciding on where to get them from. One of the places left to check is the place where I originally got them from...I'm almost positive that they will be cheaper there since in 2001 I had to replace both frame and lenses(thanks to Mekala) and it only cost me $159.00...with no warranty and no insurance so...hopefully!!!*crosses fingers just in case*

Anyway my kids are screaming their heads off because I'm mean and am making them take naps but they'll get over it. I'm a little worried since for the first time in almost 4 years my uncle Bill is trying to get ahold of me. He called while I was gone but Jeremy didn't realize who it was and didn't answer it. He lives in Pheonix, AZ...and I have no idea as to why he would be calling me unless it's bad news...so I'm more than a little worried...I don't know how any of my family is doing and I haven't heard anything about them. I have 3 aunts and 2 uncles that live in the New Orleans area and a cousin that lives in Jackson, Mississippi so hopefully all is well with them.  If not I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. 

But I guess that's enough for now. I'm sure I'll update as soon as I talk to Uncle Bill."

"event","Well I got some good news today...someone will be home on the 20th...YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I get to go and get new glasses today...well actually new lenses sense I happen to love my frames. It's only taken me 7 years(just over) to get them but...it's all good. I'm just so happy right now that it's not even funny. I feel like I'm flying. Oh yeah another miracle that happened today...My husband just got out of bed!!! That is so unusual, it had me worried for a minute as I thought I had missed my appointment. He's only up 5 1/2 hours early...Oh well no complaining on my part. So for now that is all, I'm going to spend some time with my husband and my kids. Don't worry I'll be back online after 2:30ish. Have fun"

"event","well where to begin...I got drunk last night for the first time in almost a year...it was great fun. My co-worker and really good friend came over and hung out for quiet awhile after work. I only got 2 hours of sleep last night because of it but amazingly enough Jeremy actually let me take an hour nap before he left for work so I'm a little better off than I was...not much but a little.

The kittens are doing really well, although they aren't as playful as my husband would like them to be. They are however, extremely lovey dovey. His favorite is Smokey and mine is Oreo...Jewels loves her kitten, she won't leave her alone half the time but Oreo doesn't care so it's all good. Smokey basically hides most of the afternoon and comes out at night to lounge around. They had fleas when we got them and we are working on getting rid of them, however they will probably get at least 3 more treatments just in case. 

My kids are being brats like usual. Jewels punched her sister and actually gave her a black and blue eye...I couldn't believe it. Yesterday she bit Mekala...I don't know what I'm going to do with her but we gotta figure something out and quick. Mekala is becoming a whiner and tattler from hell...and of course she can't rat her sister out when she really needs to...just when she wants to and it's a minor thing. But oh well...more shit to figure out and hopefully get corrected soon. Mekala starts school Sept. 12 so I know that she'll straighten her act up soon enough, otherwise she doesn't get to go.

But I guess I posted enough for now so I'll let your poor eyes and head have a break from all of my bitching. Take care everyone"

"event","My baby had her well-child check up today and all is well...which is funny since she won't quit crying. I don't even know why she's crying now...she has no teeth coming in, no temp, no part of her body that hurts(if she does she won't tell me about it), she didn't hurt herself. So I don't know what her problem is. I doubt she's still tired since she's only been up for a couple of hours and she woke up on her own so...I don't know. We just discovered that our car has a flat tire...and of course we don't have a spare because that would just make perfect sense. Anyway I have to get ready to go to work so have fun everyone and I'll talk to you Aug 7th sometime a.m."

"event","Believe it or not this post will have nothing to do with my family...instead it will be all about a friend of mine. And yes, I will be doing lots and lots of bitching so you have been warned. This is about my friend, and they know who they are!!!!

I have a friend who needs to be smacked upside the head a good dozen times or more. He's stubborn, pig-headed and I jsut really want to hurt him. He doesn't take care of himself and yes I know it's difficult but GODDAMMIT YOU NEED TO! You aren't going to do anyone any good if you don't. Yes, I'm sure I'm sounding like your mother but guess what to damn bad! If you were standing in front of me right now I'd knock you out and throw you in a bed, lock you in your room and then after 5 hours I might consider letting you out. I don't care what you say about why you don't take care of yourself. YOU KNOW BETTER!!!! Yes, you need to help other people but you need to tend to yourself first. And, if you get hurt because of it I'm going to hunt your scrawny ass down and kick your ass!! Quit being so damn hard on yourself for every little thing...

I know I'm a bitch but you'll deal with it or you'll ignore me. But sometimes I just want to scream at you and beat you senseless so that way you might get the point. But I'm not kidding, you had better take care of yourself.  I will find out if you don't and I will hurt you."

"event","We went and got the new kittens tonight. We were only going to allow them to get one, but daddy fell in love with one and the girls fell in love with another.  So yeah...we have two of them. A pure long-haired grey named Smokey and a black and white short-haired named Oreo. The girls got to name them. Jewels named Smokey and Mekala named Oreo. At least the names are fitting. Now we have to run to the store and get another collar and a few new toys. The kittens are both 2 1/2 months old and so very lovable. It's nice to have them around. They aren't shy nor are they scared when my kids are chasing them around. But I've gotta go for now so I'll update later"

"event","Jeremy and I are taking the girls out to eat tonight. It's highly unusual for us to go out for dinner so I'm kinda excited...even if it is to Pizza Hut(which was my choice). The girls are being a pain in the butt...they probably are sick of being in the house since they haven't been able to play outside in the past couple of days. But they'll be able to play outside tonight so I'm sure they will straighten up. Anyway it's time for me to go and tend to my kids...Have fun."

2) I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3) I'll pick a flavor/color of jello to wrestle with you in.
4) I'll say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5) I'll tell you my first memory of you.
6) I'll tell you what animal you remind me of.
7) I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.
8) If I do this for you, you must post this on your journal.


Anyway...Jewels teeth finally came in all the way...now I don't have to deal with her screaming and crying about it all the time, well at least not until more decide to come in.  Jeremy has to work today...even though this is suppose to be his day off. Hopefully he calls in tomorrow so the me and the girls can spend some time with him this week. But, I'm sure he won't...so I have to wait until next Monday to actually spend time with him.  My girls are getting a kitten this week, hopefully. Jeremy had to kill their cat...although he didn't suceed since she's still roaming around. He's gotta get rid of her because she's already attacked Jewels and our neighbors granddaughter Megan...definetly not good. They want a grey kitten and my co-worker/good friend has a cousing with kittens so on Weds we get to go for a little trip to pick one out...if Lacey(co-worker) can get the time to do it...HOPEFULLY!!!! Anyway that's all for now I'm sure I'll post some later..."

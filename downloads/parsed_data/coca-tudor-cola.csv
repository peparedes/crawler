Even though it is summer, I only have 4 days to have a summer being that on Monday I move into Wheeler and start RA training.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am so excited to be an RA...Wheeler is going to be the hall that you want to be at.

I am so happy. It is that next step of leadership to end a wonderful four years at college. It is weird to think that next year is my last year on campus, but hey it is time to move on and finally become a teacher!! Which is what I have wanted for sooooo long. College has been more amazing each and every day! Each year gets better and better....so I can't wait to see what next year will bring! My 21st is coming up in 16 days!!! However, I have New Staff Orientation and then an in hall activity....so my 21st will be spent with my new staff in my new hall. But hey I will be 21 for a while...I will be leagal from then on so I think I am good on that one! <br /><br /></font><font color=""#339966"">So I think I pretty much failed my test today. It is sad...I love this class. But we had to know and I mean KNOW over 33 Supreme Court Cases ranging from issues on Freedom of the Press to Free Exercise Clause and The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. DAMN there are a lot of cases based on those issues. When it comes to these test, I have not figured out the best way to study these cases and know these cases. This was the second test, and I changed from the first, but it wasent good enough. <br /></font><br /><font color=""#99cc00"">Its weird. I always feel that I have to be excellent at school. I am sitting here gripping about the fact that I am getting Bs in my classes. Right now I have an overall GPA of a 3.55...so why do I stress... Some cant even get that or can't ever reach that. Am I crazy? I look at what I have done and I am excited. I have grown so much as a leader. I have always been told it is not about the grades it is what you have done to get to the point and the activities you do that help you prepare. So why does the grades still affect me so much? Is a 3.55 justifiable? I tend to think so. I would hate to drop below a 3.50. The sad thing is I love all my classes...I hope to at least bring that up...and I think I can. I need to go visit my professors. Talk to them. It is suprising how that helps. I did that my freshman year and did amazing! (3.94 first semester at CMU) so why have I stopped.</font> <br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">This next week is our Spring Break...So my goals for the remainder of the year.... <br />meet with my professors talk to them (that helps out well) <br />STUDY STUDY STUDY <br />Live LIFE! <br />Have Fun <br />Stop Stressing!!!!! <br /><br />HA! Obtainable?!?! Maybe!?!?! <br /></font><br /><font color=""#003300"">The good thing is that with MORHA the conference will be done after break! I have loved MORHA and RHA but when that is done I will be so happy. It is shocking at how much time consuming this all is. Right now I have meetings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and then work and then classes....but not just the meetings it is also the preparation to get ready for these meetings. Getting a delegation ready for a conference. Preparing a report and presenting reports at RHA meetings..RHA E-Board, doing the task for those meetings...Hall Councils etc....I am ready for a break....the only thing is I have soo much to do over Spring Break its not even funny!</font> <br /><br /><font color=""#339966"">NO matter what I love it....I would not trade this in for anything. <br /><br /></font><font color=""#99cc00"">I miss a lot of people. There are people who I used to talk to everyday and no longer do. I miss them....not just the CMU people but my friends from down home. I hope to see them this weekend over break! Its weird I like facebook cause I see their pictures, but I can't wait to talk to them spend time with them and find out how they are doing. There is a lot I have done that I have not told some of these people....</font> <br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Going to New Orleans and how that has affected my life <br />Gold Ambassador Nomination for RHA for Homecoming Next Year <br />Leadership Camp Faciliatator <br />RA for next year <br />Summer classes <br />Living in Mount Pleasant over the Summer <br />Going to UC Berkely <br /></font><br /><font color=""#003300"">There is so much that goes on that means a lot to me that I just dont get the chance to tell people. I sometimes don't even get to call my family. Its funny the times I am avaliable is right now 2:30am and I am up while everyone else is sleeping.</font> <br /><br /><font color=""#339966"">Well folks I am going to relax...I have to be up at 9:30 to go pick up t-shirts and poster board then go to two classes....then besides work (2 shifts of mid-4) my weekend/Spring Break will be happening!</font> <br /><br /><font color=""#99cc00"">Lowell people if you are going to be around from Saturday to Thursday give me a call.

"event","So yeah it is almost Christmas! That means this semester is almost over! YAY!!!! I have had one of the longest yet fastest semesters ever. If that makes sense snap for that. One of the greatest happenings this semester is meeting two new friends from classes. I feel that some of the greatest friends you will ever have are the ones who are sitting next to you in the classes with you. That is how I met Kristen my freshman year and that is how I met Maria and Holly. With them as friends, it is the greatest experience ever. Maria and Holly are the coolest people in the world, who I adore! 

I also had some of the greatest classes, well one, HST 301. The professor was awesome...no amazing. Anyone at Central, I encourage you to take Dr. James Daybell, it won't be a waste of time that is for sure!!!! The rest of the classes were challenging. I hate economics with a passion. The good news is that I finished the Geography portion of the Social Studies major! YAY!!! Then the other class had so much potential until the professor made me feel like I had no voice in his class. I strongly believe that how a professor teaches a class and treats the students will be how the students feel about that course. I entered this semester with excitement for the class, not even a month into it he ignored a comment I made in class. I think deep inside I still resent him for that. That was one of the classes that I skipped a lot this semester. Why go to a class where the professor doesn't feel you have a voice? I was so excited to write his evaluation....but no suprise I skipped that class when we did that. How ironic and weird was that?!?! But overall it was an exciting semester. And boy, next semester is about the same! 2 HST classes, 2 PSC classes and yet one more...the last ECO class ever (Environmental Economics...yeah that blows!!!) ;-)

Well the other busy portion of my life has been RHA and MORHA being the MOCC. WOW!!!! What an experience. First, the other MOCC across the state....CC LOVE! They are the coolest people I have ever met and even some of the coolest friends ever. We only see each other once in a while but when we do...stand back its wild! The board for MORHA is also awesome! Every member is amazing and chatting with them makes me feel stronger as a leader!RHA could not be any more exciting! Brooke, Dan, Andrew, Aaron and Leigh! What a team! I love my NCC (Leigh) she is amazing. She is my little gazelle! (Long story another LJ...maybe);-) This year has been exciting! I have made amazing new friends and have been so busy that some have slipped out, but not gone! To those of you who fit that category...words cannot express how much I still love you all!

"event","So this weekend was Get Hyped. This was the first time I was the conference staff! It was exciting! Anyway the guest speaker was Marlenna Taylor (my Leadership Camp Facilitator from LCamp 03!) She was awesome!

She told the story of Kyle to us as a way to show us that what we say and or do can affect someone's life in a way that we may never know or at least know at this exact moment...

Here is the story!

One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd."" I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon),so I shrugged my shoulders and went on. 

As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. 

As I handed him his glasses, I said, ""Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives."" He looked at me and said, ""Hey thanks!"" There was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before. He said he had gone to private school before now. I would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We talked all the way home, and I carried his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with me and my friends. He said yes. We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him. 

Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said, ""Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!"" He just laughed and handed me half the books. Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship. 

Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about being nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak. 

Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. He filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him. Boy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I could see that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said, ""Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"" He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. ""Thanks,"" he said. 

As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began. ""Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell you a story."" 

I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile. ""Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable. ""I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize it's depth. 

Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture you can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way. Look for God in others.

To all of you who read this, friends or those who are randomally look at this...I love you and I urge you to tell someone today, tomorrow, or whenever how much you feel for them. Who knows it could change their lives in a way you never thought possible!

                                               *********
1 - First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.

During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one:
""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""
Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?
I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.
""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say ""hello.""
I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain

One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride.  Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man
took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.  She seemed t o be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A special note was attached... It read:
""Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along.  Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away... God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others.""
Sincerely,
Mrs. Nat King Cole.


3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.
""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.
""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.
The little boy pulled is hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.
""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.
""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied.
The little boy again counted his coins.
""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.
The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, was one quarter, two dimes and five pennies.  You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had
to have enough left to leave her a tip.

 


4 - Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our Path.
In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.  Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing
and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand! 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.


5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts...
Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a
deep breath and saying, ""Yes I'll do it if it will save her."" As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded.  He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, ""Will I start to die right away?""  Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.



Now you have 2 choices.
1. Ignore this post, or
2. Repost it so other people can read it.

I hope that you will choose No. 2 and remember.

Most importantly.................. ""Work like you don't need the money, sing like no one is listening, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching.""

NOW more than ever - Please...Pay It Forward...hug three people you love and ask them to pay it foward as well.

1. At Leadership Camp I saw so many great leaders be involved with this thing on Campus called Alternative Breaks. What it allows is for an individual to spend their break going somewhere to help make a change. So I decided that this year I would apply and see what would happen. In light of what happened to New Orleans with Katrina, AB is offering an Alternative Winter Break for Disaster Relief in New Orleans. Being History in action, I decided to apply. I was excited for this opportunity. I get a phone call from my friend Val (Co-Facilitator at LCamp) and she says that she is the Site Leader for the Disaster Relief, being way excited about that, she said that I needed to set up an interview. I had the interview...and yesterday well Thursday....Val called me back and said that I got it! I am in!!!! So this Winter Break I am going to New Orleans!!!! I am really excited. I am a little scared about being away from home for the pre-Holiday season, especially being that our family takes the holiday season so hard in light of what happened only two years ago. But I will be back Christmas Eve and will have the rest of Christmas Eve and New Years Eve/Day with them as well as Thanksgiving ;-) although that is not relivant to this time but hey its something to throw out there!!!!

2. Kristen lives in Robinson this year. I am so happy that she is! I met her in ENG 101 when I was a freshman. Me and her are really close friends. I don't know what I would do without her. She is the coolest person in my life. Its funny, she lives in New Baltimore and I live in Lowell (really far apart). I called her randomly this summer, and we picked back up like we just saw each other the day before. I really think that our friendship is a strong one, you know the one that TV capitalizes on the one that will be there even when you are 80 and on a walker!!! Tonight was however our night on the town. We painted the city Red, well not really, however, I can see us actually going through Mount Pleasant painting the city red. Holding paint brushes with a can of red paint and just having the best time of our lives. Anyway, we went to Las for dinner then went to the movies, where we just randomly showed up to watch a movie, just our luck everything was already in view of showing. So we are looking at this thing with a description, and I am like hey lets watch Stay. She was very anti-""Stay""ing. I was like no, we are going to watch this and like it!!! ;-) So the movie starts at 11:10 and its like 9:45. So we head to Meijer, just to pee and look around and laugh and joke about random shit like we always do. We head back to the movies and hoping that this is not a waste of time. Well lets just say Kristen was right we should have ""Stay""ed home. The movie was confusing...but the funny part was I kept wanting to talk to her during the movie about the movie, but she refused because she though I was going to spoil information or knew what the hell was going on when she wanted to get it for herslef. Well that was not my motives I had no freakin idea what was going on. When the movie ended I looked over at her and she was like what the fuck did we just watched. I said wait, you don't know what happened either?!?! So yeah that was pretty much the worst movie ever, but the best night ever as well!!! I luv Kristen!!!!

3. I LOVE HARRY POTTER!!!!!! WOW I am obsessed with JK Rowling and her books! So I went to Halloween USA a store here in Mount Pleasant and found...""The Sorting Hat""!! YES people the Sorting Hat. So....I bought it. Now I didn't wake up intending to find the Sorting Hat nor a Halloween Costume...but I did!! So I pick up the hat and continue walking around. I figured I would just get the hat thats all...Nope found a cape complete with a hood...So i bought that too!!! So now I have the Sorting Hat, the cape, and black pants, shoes and white shirt at home. Now I wanted a tie, and this Halloween I would go as a student being sorted into a particular house (deciding factor being the tie I would get). Now remember people I live in Mount Pleasant, that is where CMU is. Our school colors are the colors of Griffyendor...so could I find a tie with Gold and Maroon, NOPE. So I found a blue striped tie. So this Halloween I am a student being sorted into Ravenclaw! NOT TOO BAD I SUPOSE. ;-). I love it. It is freakin awesome!!!! 

4. If I wasent so tired I would fill in more information about what has been going on in my life since like August when I gave a truly long explanation...yeah my life blows! ;-) . But I will try to update more often. Cause there has been a lot of good things going on in my life.

Have a great night people!!!!

"event","Here it is, the night of move in day. Already I have been back since last Thursday when I came up to work the front desk. I cannot believe that I have been up here for over a week, and to be honest I can't believe I am already back. This year is going to be amazing. It has been awesome seeing these new freshman come up here for Leadership Safari, eager to get up here and start what I hope will be an incredible journey as they make the discovery of what it means to be away from their families and truly on their own for the first time. At Leadership Camp, I saw so many eager Seniors excited to come to CMU and now that is happening. What seemed so far away back in May is now a reality. I have meet a lot of Safari people who were also at Leadership Camp and I can't help but smile and flashback to those wonderful times. It was truly an exciting time. However, as this school year starts, and as I listen to those awesome leader inspiring music, I can't help but be inspired to go out into CMU and Mount Pleasant and make a change. I want to share some of my favorite lyrics that are truly inspiring to go out and make a change. I realized that leaders are all in different shapes and forms. EVERYONE is a great leader, a title doesn't make you a great leader, being a great leader makes you a great leader. It is how you use your leadership skills that makes it all worth while. So as this year starts, remember these lyrics and what they say and my wish to all who read this entry, good luck this year, I hope to see some of you again, and most of all I can't wait to see how you become or continue to show how great of leader you are or can be!

These lyrics are from Leadership Camp and this first one is to the tune of ""A Whole New World"" but with a leadership camp twist.

I can make social chage,
With the Seven C Model.
Tell me campers now how did you last lead your club this week.
I can open your eyes
Make your leaderhsip double.
Through some good times and troubles
If your brave enough to seek

A Social Change
A way to lead at CMU
It helps you get involved
And problem solve
Expand upon your dreaming

A Social Change
A new model I never knew
And when I'm far from home
I'm not alone
'Cause now I made a social change with you

(Now I made a social change with you)

Unattainable goals
Is now what I'm achieving
Working, growing, believing
At a University

A Social Change
(Don't you dare close your eyes)

200 RSO's to lead
(Hold your breath it gets better)

I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A Social Change
(Every turn a suprise)

With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment gets better)

We will start right away
I'm not afraid
Let me share this social change with you

A Social Change
(A Social Change)

That's what we'll do
(That's what we'll do)

It's yours and mine
(A thrilling time)

At CMU

""Chain of Love""

He was driving home one evening, 
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down, 
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened, 
Standing out there in the snow 
'Til he said I'm here to help you ma'am, 
By the way my name is Joe

She said I'm from St. Louis, 
And I'm only passing through
I must have seen a hundred cars go by, 
This is awful nice of you
When he changed the tire, 
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away, 
She said how much do I owe you
Here's what he had to say

You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too
Someone once helped me out, 
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back, 
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you

Well a few miles down the road, 
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat, 
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice, 
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along, 
And dead on her feet

And though she didn't know her story, 
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change, 
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door, 
And on a napkin left a note 
There were tears in the waitress's eyes, 
When she read what she wrote

You don't owe me a thing, 
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out, 
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back, 
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you

That night when she got home from work, 
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinkin' about the money, 
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping, 
She whispered soft and low
Everything's gonna be alright, I love you, Joe 

****

Sarah McLachlan
""World on Fire""

The worlds on fire its more then I can handle
Ill tap into the water try and bring my share
Try to bring more, more then I can handle 
Bring it to the table 
Bring what I am able

Hearts are worn in these dark ages
Youre not alone in these stories pages
The light has fallen amongst the living and the dying
And Ill try to hold it in 
Yeah Ill try to hold it in

Chorus

I watch the heavens but I find no calling
Something I can do to change whats coming
Stay close to me while the skys falling
I dont wanna be left alone dont wanna be alone

Chorus

Hearts break hearts mend love still hurts
Visions clash planes crash still theres talk of 
saving souls still colds closing in on us

We part the veil on our killer sun
Stray from the straight line on this short run
The more we take the less we become
The fortune of one man means less for some

Chorus

****

Switchfoot
""Dare you to Move""

Welcome to the planet
Welcome to existence
Everyone's here
Everyone's here
Everybody's watching you now
Everybody waits for you now
What happens next?
What happens next?

I dare you to move
I dare you to move
I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
I dare you to move
I dare you to move
Like today never happened
Today never happened before

Welcome to the fallout
Welcome to resistance
The tension is here
The tension is here
Between who you are and who you could be
Between how it is and how it should be

I dare you to move
I dare you to move
I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
I dare you to move
I dare you to move
Like today never happened
Today never happened

Maybe redemption has stories to tell
Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
Where can you run to escape from yourself?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Salvation is here

I dare you to move 
I dare you to move 
I dare you to lift yourself 
Lift yourself up off the floor 
I dare you to move 
I dare you to move 
Like today never happened 
Today never happened 
Today never happened 
Today never happened before 

I hope you enjoy these lyrics as much as I do. Take these and make this 2005-06 school year the year where you look in the mirror see the man who can make the change and set out to change the world. I dare you to move, share the social chage with others, and pass what you know to others and watch the chain just ripple down the world!!!!!

"event","So yeah, it has been a while since I last updated this thing. THe good news is, I think I am finally caught up on all the sleep that I have missed out on this past year. I think a few people from Central and Robinson Hall can testify that I hardley slept. The first month of summer was not good for sleeping either. So now that I am caught up hopefully I can catch up on the activeness and social life that I should really catch up on. 

First of all because it has been a while I need to put a section in about NACURH!
Damn what a great time that was. Although SU is very hilly (122 steps that lead to our Hall...Yes my fat ass climbed those steps like 3-4x a day!) Damn that was a bitch, but I survived. I think I left half of me there though! The experience was awesome. Central had an awesome delegation! Those from Central truly know how to have a blast anywhere we go. One of the greatest things that I brought back from this trip was a great friendship that came out of this trip. Leeah and me truly hit it off during this trip. Leeah is a great friend and I love her a lot. Even after NACURH we still hang out and talk. A really great woman who makes me laugh and is a joy to be around. I luv yah Leeah! The conference was good. Being my first conference ever well besides Get Hyped and DREAM which are Central Conferences, this was my first conference which included a lot more than Central people. It was great to get out of Michigan for truly the first time and plus the memories are great. Some great quotes came out of this conference that are documented in Tabatha's Journal, damn I gotta get that so I can copy those things down here. Anyway, it was a great time.

It was after the conference though that my Summer began. For the first week I basically slept. I hung out with some home people, but more time was spent in my bed. 

There is a lot that I want to do this summer. Now that it has begun I guess I should start doing them. One of the most important things that I need to accomplish is contact my friends. I truly miss them a lot, but I have a hard time calling people. I love the invention of the cell phone, but man do I suck when it comes to using them. My goal is to work on that this summer. There have been a few calls for me already that I need to call them back and chat with them. But to all my friends, I am sorry that we have not chatted yet, I am working on it. Shoot now that I have all this time now, there is no stopping me from doing it. I love you all very much and I hope that your summers are going well. I cannot wait until the fall when I can see you all again or to those friends down here I am looking forward to spending time with you before we go back to college. 

My plans are simple this summer, chat with friends, do some reading ( I spent two hours in Barnes and Nobles one night), hanging with friends and family, road trips either to other states or the east and north of our great state!) 

Well I should get going...I love you all a lot and look forward to talking to you. Continue having fun y'all and I miss you all a lot more than you can ever know!

"event","So WOW I cannot believe that Leadership Camp is over! 15 days may not seem like a long time, but to me it seemed like forever! I already miss everyone so much, which seems kinda weird but hell according to all my friends its just the sappieness that college has brought out in me! You know as a camper I never realized how great Leadership Camp truly was and now that I have been a facilitator and seen the behind scenes and truly have been able to grasp what Leadership Camp truly is I have been able to truly value and appreciate it and grow from the experience.

"event","So I pretty much think that the University intended Thursday and Friday to be pretty much days that students focused on their exams and prepare to ace all of them...yeah thats pretty much some bull shit right there. But no matter what, when classes ended on Wednesday that snowballed into the following freakin awesome times ever here at college. So let me begin with the first day...Wednesday

So after classes, I did the last Hall Council meeting, which wasent even a meeting but Mock Elections results...by the way...Most Robby Spirit right here! YAY...thats me!! Anyway, I did the program with Jackie who is pretty much one of my greatest friends here ever. Granted she is an RA, but you know what, RAs are students as well, and yeah they have power, but becoming friends with someone as powerful and intelligent and motivational and most importantly funny has been a great contributor to making me a better person. If anyone has not heard a story from Jackie then they are truly missing out. Seriously who laughs when a 3 year old sleds down a hill and breaks her leg on a washing machine!!! Jackie...thats who!! Seriously, she is the best, and the two of us did an awesome job (a little more work then needed) to throw this Mock Election progtam. Anyway, so after the meeting, I had my NACURH conference meeting, that was fun although we got information on what we will be wearing...they are going to put us all in grey baseball stretchy pants...wait it gets better..then they are going to put us in a silver windbreaker...thats right everyone...I am going to look like a giant big Idaho potato just coming out of the microwave!!! But hey, I am a team player. 

However it was after the NACURH meeting when life got pretty much awesome! I went out! Being that my duties of president were pretty much over, I got out of the hall and had a blast. I went to the Pub for the first time where I met up with Danielle, Jackie, Cameron and his girlfriend (yeah picture of them on a stripper pole together ;-)  ), Jon and Amy, Bryant, Emily, Tyrone, Cory, and Mike. It was a blast. Hanging out with them all was a fun time in itself. However, having my first ""Sex on the Beach"" was great followed by a Coke and Rum was great as well. Then from the Pub a bunch of us went to Chip Village where we went to a kegger! Hell yes that was fun. I either had 6 or 7 beers one after another! Yeah I got wasted that night. I seriously downed beer after beer. So we get back to the hall, I am so drunk that I can't even walk right, I am pretty much crawling and grasping onto the wall for dear life! I didn't throw up but the conversation I had with Kristen I hear was funny and the the random IM to Cory and Tony I guess was a sight in itself. 

Thursday, I worked 11:45-4:00. So not much happened then, excpet recovering from a massive hangover! Although I had to get up early (well, by 12:00) because at 1:00 was Leadership Camp Facilitator training. That day we did the activity Star Power. Star Power is one of the major activites that is done at LC. It is a great experience because that is when the campers can really see who really has the power, and that at any time a change can be made. I loved it. Even though I have participated in it before, I still suck at trading! Each facilitator was able to invite a friend to come and participate that way there would be more people involved and get the true effect of Star Power. My friend Tony came, I was glad to see him there. I thought about all the friends I could have asked, but who else would be better then someone who I consider a great leader and a mentor to have him experience this great leader builder as you learn that we all have the power to change. Plus he was really getting into this activity. Trying to create a mentor program to bring the lower people up to the top!! Also the fact that if this is supposed to be ab out leadership, then why is it discriminating?!?! (HAHA..thanks Tony for doing this, you could have easily said no to prepare for your night, but thank you for being there for me, it meant a lot walking into the room and seeing you there to help not only me but the rest of the LC facilitators...so thanks again buddy!!). So Thursday was good, relaxing and yeah...

Friday! Today was awesome!!!! It was Gentle Friday. However, I had planned on not getting up until 1:00, yeah that didn't work. Having the CMU Facility Management people knocking on my door for damage check was freakin awesome (so sarcastic!) Twice they came!! (GOSH!!!!). With them and the band from gentle friday providing awesome music for me to sleep to, I pretty much got up and showered and headed out to the ""mall"" to hang out and see who was out there. I met up with Jessica and Riley and hung out with them for a while. That was fun, we got pictures taken in front of the seal, and watched the toilet races (Yeah what other school would race toilets..thats right CMU baby!!) Something to be proud of thats for sure!! So as I am walking with them, we see Tony. He said he tried calling me to go to GF but I never heard my cell phone ring, so I spent the rest of the time there with Tony, we also ran into Leeah (pretty much love that girl..yeah pretty much the best ever ;-)  ). It was awesome spending time together. Later on Todd came and joined us, he is a really great kid. Has an awesome head on his shoulder and I see him becoming really great in life. He is extremly involved on campus and has a really great personality. Definitly a kid that I hope I will be able to spend more time with. He is a cool guy and a good friend. So after that exciting adventure at GF, we walked back to Robinson and chilled in Tony's room for a little bit. I would have loved to hung with them more, but Andrea invited me to dinner. She said a couple of days ago that she wanted to take me out to dinner to say thank you for all that I have done for her this past year. I was touched and I graciously accepted. She really is a cool girl once you have the chance to sit down and talk to her. Dinner was great! We got back to the hall and everyone was in the lobby which is where I spent most of this evening. Besides picking up a drunk friend I have been sitting down there until I came up here to write this entry. The ones down there was Riley, Cory, Emily, Amanda, Jessica and throw in a side of Jon, Bryant, Adrena, and some other. But, I pretty much spent this evening hanging with Cory. That kid is fuckin awesome! Yes fuckin..Mother fuckin (hey..its his middle name ;-) ). He kept saying that he needed to go shower or go upstairs..yeah he pretty much stayed in the lobby! He is awesome. He is funny and very much a person who being around makes you better. He has so much to say even when he is just sitting there. I am glad I had a chance to meet this kid. He is awesome. So with going to Taco Bell with Emily and Cory and then finishing the night playing Battle of the Sexes with Cory and me vs. Riley, Jessica, and Amanda. Yeah, not even teams, but Cory and I did a good job, great effort was shown in us. It was fun to just sit and hang in the lobby with all of them. Especially with Riley and Cory. Those are two people who I find to be great, but hardly ever have a chance to just hang out. So spending time with Riley at GF and hanging in the lobby then hanging with Cory tongiht and at the Pub on Wednesday was great! 

So now its 3:38 early Saturday morning and pretty soon Monday will be here with the start of exams..will I be prepared? Yeah of course, I can do this!!!! 

So thanks to everyone whose name I listed above in this Journal entry. If your name was on there, I hold you all close to me and consider you all great friends. It will be hard to say goodbye to you all this week, but it was times like these that I will always remember. So thank you all.

Have a great night, Mount Pleasant dreams to you all!!

"event","So yeah Friday was an awesome day!

Not only was it Leadership Camp Facilitator Training, which freakin rocks! I was able to hang out with some of the best people I have ever had the chance to meet. So, lately I have been hanging out with someone who I would not have expected to be spending time with, Leeah. She is the coolest person ever. I love her a lot (her boyfriend is cool as well ;-) ) Leeah is one of those individuals who makes you laugh for no reason. Everytime I am around her it is awesome! She really is someone I have been able to call a friend even though we have not been around each other for a long time. Having her here in Robby next fall is going to be great! But, since like two moths ago, we have been hitting it off really well. With a common love of MORHA and now the MOCC and even more Robinson, there is just a lot that we connect on, especially since she is from Greenville which is like 15 minutes from Lowell!! 8-). I know it sounds like a bad phrase that is definilty overuesed, but this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship! After training got over, Eric, Leeah and I went out for dinner at the Italian Oven. Pretty much the best time ever! Leeah is great and having her as a friend makes me even greater! 

So to make the day even better, I hung out with probably the greatest friend I have, Kristen! I love this girl more than anything. The fact that we just hit the road and drove into Midland for a milkshake at 1:00 in the morning was freakin awesome! I feel like I have known Kristen all of my life, but we have only known each other for a little more than a year. She is the best. I have never laughed so hard then when I am around her. Everything about her is awesome. From Brunner, Vetne, to wild times is my room ;-), random coversations at odd times of the day/night, to crappy lemon shit at Shoneys and pretty much anyother thnig that make the two of us great is great (LOL). What is even better is that next fall she will be living in Robinson. That is freakin awesome!! The good times will continue!! Hangin out with these two was a great and I love them both. Two great people!!

Today (Sunday) was a busy day though. It was Order Day, Desk Meeting and NRHH Induction. My dad and sister came up to go to the ceremony as well as help bring ""Order"" to the room. The ceremony was good. I don't want to say awesome, but it was ok. I love that organization because of the people. There are so many wonderful strong leaders inside this organization and so many friends in there as well. One of my friends from the Hall is in this organization. I actually handed her the application and told her that she should try to get in. And she did (WAY TO GO JOANNA). Joanna is probably the most dedicated and hard working woman and even the most passionate ever! She is remarkable in every aspect and even modest when it comes to realizing how hard of a worker or even how great she is. With her in NRHH it is great, because now she is recognixed nationally as truly being the top 1% of the leaders of the hall. Way to go Joanna, I luv yah and congratulations!! 

Well, it is time for me to hit the sac (HAHA..NOT THE STUDENT ACTIVITY CENTER...LOL...LOL...) I mean it is time for me to go to bed!!!

Have a great day everyone and Mount Pleasant Dreams!

"event","WOW what a week this was,

It is sad that its all coming to an end. This semester has been one of great memories and great times and laughs. First of all, the COE Banquet was pretty much the best day of my life! I had an amazing time. Another one of those great dances held here at CMU. This dance was awesome because there was tons of people that I hold dear to my heart and new friends that I have made just this semester! It was a blast. The COE part was great as well. I was shocked to find out that I recieved second place for President of the Year. I was so shocked. It didn't really sink in until later on that evening, when I was like damn, out of twenty halls each having remarkable Presidents (Joe from Merrill, Abby from Calkins, Leigh from Woldt/Emmons, Stephanie from Sweeney and many many more great Presidents), I recieved second place. I truly felt honored. I am proud of those who wrote that bid as well. Angela and Jessica are pretty much the best people in the whole world! I love them so much and they are turly great!!! Also that night I was sworn in as the MOCC for next year. I recieved my key from Leeah to the RHA office. I am so excited with what next fall is going to have in store for me. Monday night was great and I loved every minute of it. The rest of the week was all about last as well. It was my last E-Board meeting of this year. It didn't go as well as I was planning on. I had this great idea to go with the E-Board out to McDonalds for dinner. One last time to be all together and outside the Hall. Great idea but happened at a bad night. Some were not seeing what I wanted it to be, but hey you'll have that! The meeting was short and included the current and new E-Board. After was the transitioning 1:1. I was so happy to give all those materials to Jon, although I laughed to myself during the whole meeting. It was a strange DeJa Vu  experience. I remember the night that I was in my 1:1 with Tony. We sat down, he told me everything and more of what the job was liked then asked the question if I had any questions. My response was, it is all a little much right now, but I am sure I will have some as I go along. That is exactly what happened during this meeting. however I sat there in the position Tony was in with me. Jon even said the exact same response that I gave to Tony. I also sat there seeing Jon trying to process this information and the whole time I am sitting there thinking to myself that I already know this and deal with this, but trying to explain it to someone else was an experience. I have no concerns with Jon as President, I feel he is going to be a great leader for Robinson Hall. It is funny, cause as he becomes the President, I join the list of alumni presidents of this great hall. Wednesday was another one of those last as well. It was the last business meeting of Hall Council. I had Jon run the meeting (actually we ran it together). We have this portion of the agenda called Cs Rs and HIs (Complaints, Roses, and Hall Improvements). I love C R and HI time because I am a freak who cares for so many people and loves to recognize. The first time I did a big ""R"" was the end of January. At this particular HC meeting, it was Tony's last meeting. So, during the Rose portion, I raised my hand and spoke. It was funny because I remember that day like it just happened. He had no idea what was going on, and he sat up there with that look like it was just another HC meeting, another responsibility of being President blah blah blah. All of a sudden, I stood up and said that I actually had 12 roses, and I actually meant 12 roses. Each member of the E-Board went to the Kitchenette and took a rose and handed it to Tony. After the roses were handed out a basket of recognition was presented to him. It was a great HC meeting. Well, at this HC meeting I did it again. This time instead of recognizing one person, I stood up and recognized my E-Board. For a semester we have been working together. Some of them I have even worked with for a full year. I love them so much and I wanted them to know how I felt of them. To make things even better, during the Hall Activity, I did a flashback to the first ""activity"" that we did at the first HC meeting. Tony had us all go around and say our name, home town, something about us and etc. So I ended the HC the same way we started, this time I had everyone say their name, home town, where they will be next year, and their favorite memory. This was by far the best activity and the hardest on an emotional level. When it got to me, I didn't know where to even begin with memories. I said many but the one I want to share here is the fact that at that first HC meeting I sat in the back and knew no one, but yet I still said in a happy cheerful voice, ""Hi I'm Mark"" and then know I sat looking around that room, knowing those people in the lobby by their name and knowing something about them and having a memory of them from this year. I can't even fit everything that I feel about these people in this Hall. My veins truly pump Robby Spirit Blood. This week was a great one. However know that these responsibilites are over, it means that the year is ending, which means saying goodbye to these people. It wont be like Winter Break when we returned these people where still here. When we get back from summer, Sarah SJ, Angela, Riley, Laura, Tony, Josh, Cory, Danielle, Jackie, Cameron, Shanay, Tyrone, Megan, Meagan, April, Erin, and many more are not going to be here. There are so many more that will not be here again. I love them all and will miss them.

I would love to continue, but it is time for me to count out and get some sleep. I had a great week, and I really do love everyone in Robinson Hall. I love you all and wish you the best!

Tim Mcgraw - Live Like You Were Dyin' Lyrics 
He said I was in my early 40's,
With a lot of life before me, 
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime.
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays,
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time.
Asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real
end.
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news.
Man what ya do.
And he says,

[Chorus]

I went sky divin', 
I went rocky mountain climbin', 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fu Manchu.
And I loved deeper, 
And I spoke sweeter, 
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying, 
And he said someday I hope you get the chance,
To live like you were dyin'.

He said I was finally the husband, 
That most the time I wasn't.
And I became a friend a friend would like to have.
And all the sudden goin' fishing, 
Wasn't such an imposition.
And I went three times that year I lost my dad.
Well I finally read the good book,
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again.
And then.

[Chorus]

Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it,
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it.

[Chorus]
Sky divin', 
I went rocky mountain climbin', 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fu Manchu.
And I loved deeper, 
And I spoke sweeter, 
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'.
And he said someday I hope you get the chance,
To live like you were dyin'.

To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'."

"event","Hey Everyone,

Damn what a great year it has been. Sitting in the lobby talkin about almost anything and everything. Meeting wonderful friends who I will hold dear to my heart forever and most of all changing my life in dramatic ways. I am leaving this year a much better man that I ever was. There are so many people that I have to thank but so little space to write it in. Tonight was a great night, one that like many more I will never forget. I have had tons of those with so many people. I truly thank Buddha, God, Allah and everyone else that I am forgetting (whichever religion you may be ;-) ) for making my life completely awesome. People wonder why I am so happy and cheerful all the time, the answer is look around. Everyone that I know, everyone that I say hi to and actually talk and have a great time with, those that I tell them that I love them, those that I see for only a short time but are happier when they leave are the reasons why I am the way I am. Even in times of stressful situations, I still find myself laughing my ass off on the inside. Life is great and I love every minute of it. Each day hold new surprises, strengthening of friends and new chances to make my life better. To all my Central friends I love you to death and thank you for every moment that you have given me to make myself a better person. Gosh...Life is great. So yeah, its pretty much the best day of my life 8-). Here is to awesome times in Robby and this past year at CMU and here is to many more great and exciting adventures that will come along the way next year!!!!

"event","Greetings again,

You know one of the greatest things that can happen to a person is when they are recognized for their hard work and dedication. I feel that I do a great job in recognizing people in what they do. To me, it is not a task to let people know how much I appreciate what they do, because when I create the recognition, it is from the heart. No matter if it is a simple mailbox stuffer, or a certificate on the wall of their room, a shamrock that contains a heart felt message or even a verbal message from the heart. That is what it is, a true, meaningful statement that I feel is deserved to the best people in my life. As president I have tried to do more of that, recognize individuals so that they feel respected and appreciated for the work that they do. However, I know I have been told by other people that they are thankful for me and what I am doing for the hall, and I know that the E-Board feels that, but sometimes I want to make the recognition for myself. It has seemed in the past weeks that what I am doing is overlooked and not meaningful. I have put my heart into this position and I have put my heart into this hall. Last Thursday, I was recognized by so many people, and they all made me feel special, however I was wanting it for more than just that day. I have been wanting someone to appreciate me or let me know how well that I was doing in the Council. Being the Hall President is a hard position. There is so much to it and there are a lot of nights where I lay in bed wondering what can I do better. How can I make meetings more productive, how can I better represent my hall in a positive, excited way to the rest of the University, or even how can I make people who come each week to the council and e-board meetings excited to be a part of this? I am already excited and proud to be a part of this dynamic place. I see everyone for their positive qualities and their skills that they have that make them great. My point is, and I know there are other E-Board members who have said their appreciation to me, but tonight, I was able to walk up to bed feeling good about myself. I was able to get that verbal message of thanks. Since getting the position, I have been thinking that I have not been doing the job right or correct. Importantly, I feel that I was not living up to the shoes of the last president. The last president was awesome and when he left and handed that gavel over to me, I did not know how I could compete to that. He defined the skills of being a great leader and having the love from the people around as well as had that passion and devotion to the hall and its members. I did not think I could do that or be that as good as he was. But tonight, one of my e-board members came up to me and said that everything is going great, and that this ship is being kept tight and running beautifully, and that it all has to do with the work that I have done. They said to me, that its not the Adviser who runs the meeting nor the Vice President, it was me. They said that I have been doing a great job. Like I said, it not that no one else has ever said how great I have been doing, because each of those members on the e-board have shown in their faces and their responses to everything that they are happy. It was actually because of one of the e-board members who got me into the position. With their strong beliefs in me to do this position, I accepted that nomination. That same person has come to me and has said that they are excited now to come to E-Board and is having fun. Tonight though, that statement made touched me. It was like finally, something I have been waiting for, for a long time. More than anything I love to see other people happy and excited about life, that is one of the main things that I love to do. Now I feel wonderful, excited and feel like that I am being noticed. Thank you all for noticing me. I love you all and keep up the good work. You make me proud to call you all members of my e-board. We have all done so much growing since we first stepped foot into that hot classroom and did not know hardly anyone. Thank you all for believing in me and most of all thanks for letting me know that I can do this. You are the best and I could not ask for better. You will never know how much you all mean to me. From the first e-board in the fall of 2004 to the Spring E-Board of 2005, you all have meant something to me. My love for you all is great and excessive. So thank you for being there for me to listen and most importantly thank you for letting me know that this is what I could do. Have Mount Pleasant dreams everyone! Have a great Easter weekend and be safe.

Love you all,
MAHJ"

You have all been right there for me and have helped me in more ways that you know it. I love you all and I thank you all for being the best...

There'll never be a minute of the day
I won't think of you
My feelings are so strong in me
I feel it through and through
There'll never be a night that's so dark that we won't shine
Or a dream that we've lost that we can't find
You'll always be, the one for me
I think of you from time to time 
And in between

Also everyone,I am the 2005-2006 RHA MOCC (Michigan Organization Communications Coordinator)! I am so excited for this position. As much as it is going to be sad that some of my close friends will not be in the hall next fall, I am so excited that not only am I on the RHA e-board, but I am the MOCC!!!! Thank you AC (CMU AC) for helping me get this position. You are my inspiration. You have pushed me to be great. I am great because of you! To the rest of my CMU friends, you are great. You are all the heart and soul of CMU. You are what keeps me positive. To my ""partner"" Danielle, you are the greatest and what we have done this year is awesome. Next year is going to be great and so is April. To my e-boards, we are making it through. It may be slow and long at times, but its getting done! Look at how much we have all grown so much this year.  

To my Lowell friends, I love you all and I miss you all. I cannot wait to see you all this summer. We have so much to catch up on and I hope to see you all very soon!

Well, goodnight my friends, have pleasant dreams and keep looking up to greater days. You are wonderful people who deserve all that life has to offer!!

Well since it has been a while let me first say that I am now 20 years old. That is right. No longer in the ""teen"" years. I hope 20 is going to be a good year. So far so good (although it has only been like 2 days). Also, I had applied to be a RA for next fall, I did not get that, but its ok. Instead, I got the Leadership Camp Facilitator position! I am so excited about that. I enjoyed camp when I went to it back in May of 2003. So now to be a Facilitator is going to be great. You learn so much about yourself in LC and it truly makes you grow as a person. Life at Central is going great. Once again my friends showed me how lucky I am to call them friends. They all made my birthday special and exciting. One of the coolest quotes on friends goes something like a true friend reaches for your hand and grabs your heart. That is extremely true. So thank you all for making me feel truly awesome. I am looking forward to finish school. This has been an exciting year for me filled with positive experiences that I can not believe has happened. As excited as I am to see the year end, I am also sad to see it end as well. So many changes will be made next year and I will miss everyone of those who are leaving. However, they will not be gone forever, they will still be within a few miles of campus and a short call away. I am getting tired tonight and I have a lot to do this week (3 papers due, 2 tests etc.), but before I leave I want to end with a special message to all of you who search this page and read my thoughts...

Motivation to become great and strive for greatness comes in a variety of ways. Be it a quote, song, or even a person, this motivation leads you to become great and become a better person. Always hold onto the thing that motivates you. Remember what got you to become great in the first place. Life is all about ups and downs and can throw unsuspected hurtles into your path at the wrong time in your life, or what may seem to be the wrong time. Just always remember that there is always that great quote that inspires you to reach for that goal that makes you the person that you are, or there is that one song that enables you to move forward and face those hurtles with strength and determination, and/or there is that one person who if not for them, would not have opened your eyes to the greatness that you are. Motivation takes that strange shape and form. So the idea that I am trying to express is this, what motivates and guides you? Whatever it may be, hold onto that and no matter what has happened in life that may be a hurtle that seems to be blocking your way to maintain that path of greatness, then remember that motivation and use it to push that block out of your way. No matter what you are still the great person that you were before and there will always be that song, quote or person there to remind you and help you out. 

Goodnight everyone, I wish you all a blessed spring as it approaches upon us. May the rebirth of our earth be the rebirth for ourselves and our souls. (sorry that is cheesey...but true). So Mount Pleasant dreams to everyone!

"event","Life is such a funny thing if you really stop and think about it. We are constantly thrown obstacles that could be good and can also be bad. It is like that damn metaphor states about life being like a roller coaster ride. No matter how much that metaphor is over used it is true. You know a couple days ago I realized that it was the first time in over a year that the 23/24 came by and I did not realize it. Of all of us in our family, I was the one who would constantly keep thinking about it and bringing it back up. It is not that I have forgotten or don't care anymore, it is just the fact that I have moved on. I can finally say that and have it be true. 

This year has been awesome. No matter how many times I say that I love Robinson Hall and the people there and on CMU's campus for that matter, I don't ever think they will truly know what impact they have made on my life. My dad asked me this weekend about where these friends of mine at Central lived. I said they were all in Robinson and that they lived on different floors. Going through my head, I started listing names and floors off. To me they are my friends, and I consider them my friends, but do they know that and do they know how much they mean to me? I am so blessed to have them all in my life. Central Michigan University and especially Robinson Hall has been a great experience in my life and has allowed me to become the man that I know I am and share myself, my true self with others. 

I have such a busy week coming up, and yeah I am concerned as to how it will all work out, but in the end it all will. Academics and Extra-Curricular are my life right now, more than ever. How sad to say but I love it. I used to be upset that I was not able to talk with my friends from home like I used to last year. But, they are moving on in their lives and are making great effects on their life, and guess what... me too! I love my home friends, in fact three of the greatest ones are on my friends list on the main page. They are the greatest friends that I have in Lowell. They have been the greatest friends that anyone could have. 

I want to end by saying this to all my friends. This applies to my CMU friends as well as my friends at home. Thank you for being awesome. You have all been a great influence to me in my life. I have awesome memories with you all, and hope to make many more. From late night conversations, to just lounging around, or sharing with you some of those moments in my life that have been road blocks in my life. If the whole world had you all as friends then the world would be filled with laughter, excitement, tears, smells, sights that are a sore to the eyes:) and no need for anger or violence, just tons of sarcasm. I love you all, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best and say thanks again for being a friend!

"event","Well this is my first shot at keeping a journal. Everyone I know seems to have one of these, so like always, I follow along with the trend. In all reality, you would think that a history major would jump to this idea being that when I am 30 years old, I can look back at this and read MY history. I guess life is funny that way. 

I should be sleeping right now, but my roommate is gone, and the room is to myself and I can't seem to sleep. This week has been one hell of a week. First of all, today I found out that I was elected to the position of President for Robinson Hall. Plus, today was the first day I actually ran the Hall Council meeting. It was definitely an exciting moment for me. This year has definitely been a year that has helped me grow as a leader. This hall that I am living in is great. The people here are great and everyday I am blessed to call them all my friends. They are the ones who see this great man inside. Yes, I know I am awesome, but sometimes its hard to see that inside yourself. Sometimes it takes those who mean a lot to you to make yourself see that. With this position that I have been elected to is a great opportunity for me. For one, not just being the one in charge of the Hall Council, I get to interact with other Hall Presidents through RHA. I hate to see the former President leave his position. He was an awesome leader, but to him he does not see that. It goes back to that statement that it is hard to know how great you are until someone comes and tells you that you are. In this case, he is awesome. A great mentor and a great friend. We have a few new people on our e-board now, but I am excited to work with them. They are great friends and to work with them this semester is going to be my highlight! 

Well, I wanted to start this journal of with a good start. It will be interesting to look back at this when I am older to see how far I have come or try to see what went wrong. :) 

It is time for me to go to bed. I have class at 11:00am tomorrow (ENG 262: Masterpieces of European Lit.). I also have an application due at 5:00 to be a facilitator for Leadership Camp 05. I better get some sleep so that I can face a new day.

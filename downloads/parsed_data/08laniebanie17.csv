"event","this guy <logan smith> is like a male oprah....LIsTEN UP GUYS!!! this guy KNOWS what he's talking bout......

A girl's mind works in strange ways-as if you didn't know-and the things that attract them to men are mostly NOT what you expect . Here's what they are( not necessarily in order of importance ) :--

<ul>
<li><b>Honesty</li>
<li>Sense of humor</li>
<li>Eye contact</li>
<li>Smiles</li>
<li>Personality</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Maturity</li>
<li>Sensitivity</li>
<li>Looks (this one is definitely in the right place in order of importance!)</b></li>
</ul>


Ever noticed how a girl goes completely berserk when she finds out you've lied . What's all the fuss about? you think . The big fuss they make tells you something crucial -- HONESTY is very very important to girls. Remember this if you are naturally honest and use your honesty to full advantage. Be honest with her even if your natural instinct in a particular situation is not to be . If you are naturally dishonest conceal this at all costs-you're probably good at that anyway!

A good sense of humor is amazingly attractive to most girls . They want a man who is FUN to be with .If you can make a girl laugh you're 90% there . If you have a good sense of humor-use it at every appropriate opportunity . If you haven't- WORK on it - and develop one . This can be done - watch those that have this and use their techniques - try the one that suits your personality best-experiment .

EYE-CONTACT is in my opinion the single most important factor in your success and for this reason I will go into this in more detail later . (similarly with SMILES )

A strong personality draws most girls . They really do go for a man who knows what he wants to do - no matter what anybody else thinks about him .

Girls are also drawn to confident men who are assertive , positive and don't dither . If you are less than confident - don't show it . LOOK CONFIDENT . How do you do this? TRY-study body language , either get a book on this or just observe & imitate any confident men you see around you . Stand up straight ,never fidget , head up high , slow ,steady movements and above all EYE to EYE contact at all times. You know the things I mean -observe & learn & apply .

Maturity is a big turn on with most girls . This is one reason that quite a lot find older men attractive . So it usually pays to act pretty sensibly when you're with girls ( not to the extent that you lose your sense of humor and fun of course ). Drinking beer until it comes out of your ears, falling over senseless and going on the rampage might be a good laugh when you're with the lads but it won't impress her. She might laugh but inside she'll be eaten up with embarrassment.

A lot of men think that girls are turned on by very macho men - but most girls think completely the OPPOSITE . Girls like their men to be sensitive . Don't take this too far , girls want their men to act like men but try and mix being a man with being caring and sensitive . A heady cocktail that girls find irresistible ! If you find something 'nice' or 'pretty' or something upsets you - tell her. You'll be surprised how much she warms to you . Especially if the something nice or pretty is about her!!

Whilst girls obviously go for good looks and a decent body it comes surprisingly LOW on THEIR list of priorities . By itself it doesn't turn them on like it does men . Ask a girl if she is turned on by these things , she will probably say yes but deep down a girl knows she can't find any man a turn-on unless he CARES for her too."

"event","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) - During a recent shopping trip to Nordstrom, 11-year-old Ella Gunderson became frustrated with all the low-cut hip-huggers and skintight tops. So she wrote to the Seattle-based chain's executives to complain. The industry has been getting the message: A more modest look is in, fashion experts say. 

The shy, bespectacled redhead has since become an instant media darling, appearing on national television over the past two weeks to promote modest fashions instead of the saucy looks popularized by the likes of Britney Spears. 

``We like to call this new girl Miss Modesty,'' said Gigi Solif Schanen, fashion editor at Seventeen magazine. ``It's such a different feeling but still very pretty and feminine and sexy. It's just a little more covered up.'' 

Shoppers are starting to see higher waistlines and lower hemlines, and tweeds, fitted blazers and layers are expected to be big this fall, Schanen said. 


``It's kind of like a sexy take on a librarian,'' she said. ``I think people are tired of seeing so much skin and want to leave a little more to the imagination.'' 


The Web sites ModestApparelUSA.com and ModestByDesign.com - where the slogan is ``Clothing your father would be proud of'' - report that sales have skyrocketed over the past 18 months. 


Many youngsters are frustrated by the profusion of racy teenage clothing, according to Buzz Marketing, a New Jersey-based firm that compiles feedback from teen advisers. 


``There is just sensory overload. Kids are going to say enough already,'' said Buzz's 24-year-old chief executive, Tina Wells. ``The next big trend I see is kids are going to look like monks.'' 


In 2002, a group of Arizona teens submitted a petition to the Phoenix division of the Dillard's department store chain asking for more modest clothes. The chain began carrying more conservative styles. 


Nordstrom spokeswoman Deniz Anders said the company has been hearing for about two years from customers who want more modest looks, and Nordstrom tries to carry a broad array of styles in its stores. 


The arrival of the modest look is good news for Ella, who last week participated in a sold-out ``Pure Fashion'' show in Bellevue with 37 other girls belonging to a Roman Catholic youth organization. 


Ella, who paraded down the catwalk in a long-sleeved pink top and a shiny pink skirt, hopes the fashion show - and her letter - will prompt some change. 


``There can be more than one look,'' the Redmond youngster said in an interview while wearing a loose Pure Fashion T-shirt, jeans and hot pink flip-flops. ``Everybody should have lots of choices.''

this is what i found
see nobody wants to be alone
if your touched by the words to this song
then baby

when your on the phone...
you hang up and call right back


When you say that you love him
and you really know
everything that used to matter

like your money or your car
flowers cards and candy

i got an 'a'...on this poem:
         This poem wants love...
an undying affection,
an unexplinable need,
a fufilling passion.
        This poem wants understanding...
a better life,
better family,
better world.
        This poem wants the best...
designer jeans,
tight shirts,
beautiful shoes.
        This poem wants fortune...
a promise of material things
to make it happy
because this poem is so materialistic.

but no matter how hard this poem tries,
What it wants is never what it needs...
all because
this poem wants.

Hurry up, I'm tired of school. I want to be able to go to bed whenever I want, and wake up whenver I want. I don't want to have to worry about projects, or homework, or tests. I want to be able to do whatever I want. I want to go to Paris. I want to be a dancer. I want to lay out in the sun, read magazines and eat all day. I want to go out at like 9 while its just getting dark and it's still like 85 degrees outside.

I fell in love with the Freaky Friday soundtrack all over again.

I downloaded AIM on my mom's laptop; which is a WINDOWS! Thank god. All we have in the house is the stupid Macintosh. I hate Macintosh's. But i know how to use them. So NOW i have a better version of AIM on my mommys computer, which shes's leaving here with me. YAY!

OoOoOoO, and last night, my mom and dad were in another room arguing about custody and eTc. And i found a file she had on the laptop about moving into P-Town, my guess's were right! WE MIGHT MOVE TO P-Town. Better than San Jose right? Besides, my moms San Jose lanloard said she can only live there a maximum of  5 months. I also read that my dad gets FULL custody of us during the 4th of July and New Years. (Expect those days to be very party-ish) My mom gets us FULL time Christmas and Thanksgiving (my dad doesnt celebrate anything, dont feel bad). As for Spring Break and Summer Vacation, my brother and I get to choose, but they have the FiNaL word!

So there's the update.

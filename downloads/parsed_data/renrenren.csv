"event","<strong><font color=""#339966""><u>today i worked.</u></font></strong>&nbsp; <font color=""#339966"">from 9am until 7pm. i do it every Sunday. i never arrive feeling ready to work a ten hour shift. but then again, who is ever ready to&nbsp;work a ten hour shift? it went surprisingly fast, and i only had two asshole customers, the rest were okay. i was relieved to get home and felt good after seeing my sister and talking to her and mum. having a bit of a laugh. then i came on the internet.&nbsp; <font size=""5""><strong><u>BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER</u></strong></font><font size=""2""> because now i feel like crap again. i am talking to someone, they spoke to me first mind you, and they aren't saying anything. i hate it when someone you feel you need to talk to doesn't talk. fucking talk to me. i always had a feeling he was self centered. he doesn't give a fuck about me really. he didnt even ask me how i was. i'm going insane. i'm surrounded by people who just dont CARE. i hate that. why can't people feel? and if they do feel why can't they just show it? it's beyond me. well, i guess now i will go and watch CSI Miami, mum and i are in love with that David Caruso. yes, he is repulsive looking. but he is such a cool cat. then i'll redraft my latest poem which is so fucking lame i might just burn it instead. i need a ciggie. </font></font>"

"event","<font color=""#666699""><strong><u>i'm so confused about life.</u></strong> who do you like? who do you trust? who do you hate? who do you form friendships with? who do you steer clear of? who do you love? who do you let influence you? who do you believe? who do you care about? so many people disappoint me. i'm sure i disappoint people every day. heck, i even disappoint myself. i guess you can CHOOSE to put up with disappointments from people or to eliminate them from your life depending on the degree to which you care about them. if beck or riss disappointed me i would not hesitate&nbsp;to forgive them and move on. if someone i didnt care about as much disappointed me then i guess i would not hesitate to fob them off, eliminate them from my life forever. i just can't be bothered dealing with anything other than the stuff that&nbsp; matters right now. </font>"

"event","<p align=""left""><font color=""#993366"" size=""2""><strong><u>i don't know why.</u></strong> but i feel really down. it all started on thursday. i spent wednesday at uni and hung out with Jamie afterwards. we walked in the rain and FOR THE FIRST TIME i didn't have to give him a kiss goodbye on the cheek. he gave me one! so it was a wonderful day. but thursday was crap. jamie didnt come to the art history lecture and didnt reply to any of my messages. i get paranoid when i like someone so i guess i worried. last night i panicked and sent him all these stupid messages... i'm such a moron. seriously regret everything i have said and done in the last few days. it's easier not caring about people. </font></p>"

"event","I'm watching American Beauty. It's one of the movies that makes my heart swell with excitement and curiosity. It's beautiful. This evening was quite random. After class, I took a walk in the rain up to the store and bought some fruit so I could make this giant bowl of fruit salad. I walked the railroad tracks on the way home. The rain was light even to call it mist, but it was still chilly despite the layers I had on as well as my scarf warming my neck. I love that cozy feeling. It was nice having all that stretch of track all to myself while the beams glistend off the street lamps. I was amazed of how much trash people throw behind the banks going down to the tracks. It's a shame. I kept looking back in paranoia making sure a train wasn't sneeking up on me, but towards the end where I turn to walk back to my house, I heard the train's horn, which was exciting and scary. I couldn't see its lights, but I felt its vibration on one of the beams which was exciting. I'd like to put a handful of pennies up there, then pick them up the next time it rides through. There was a waterfall near the woods too. It was even more beautiful hearing it in the dark.

Esskyma wrote a new song. It's really sad, but hopeful. Very Explosions In the Sky-esqe. I think whenever we complete a full-length it's going to be called, ""North Of No South: These Are the Buried Stories."" I think it'll range to over an hour of music easy. But before our full-length, we'll be recording a split CD with our dance friends, Le Vansona. We did have a show last Saturday. It was amazing. We played to 15 people in a pitch black basement. A side from the red and blue light fixtures, it was complete darkness. The high point was, everyone sat and watched. We've wanted that since our first show, and it took 11 tries. Jess, I still need to get in touch with my brother about the Athens show. As soon as I know, you'll be one of the first to know. I hope you can make it."

"event","I can't believe it's November already. I'm quite anxious for tomorrow since it's Election Day. If you're registered, please, go vote. I'm turning in my application for the Java House tomorrow, and I'm hoping to work mornings before class. I need more money. I'm going to see Low in Columbus in February. Yeah, February, I think. Aracde Fire is playing in Cleveland in a couple of weeks, but I doubt I'll go since it'll be the same time as my finals. Plus, I'll be visiting my Dad with my brother in Charleston for the holiday. I'm tired of shows though. Towards the middle of October I saw Death Cab For Cutie, Explosions In the Sky, the Black Heart Procession, Interpol and the Decemberists all in a row. It was so much fun, but ironic of how much it wore me out on my week's paid vacation.

Esskyma had a show in a basement on Saturday for 15 people. It was pitch black, a side from the red and blue light fixtures. Everyone sat too! Finally. It was a very intimate show with our close friends.

I don't know, lately, it seems I've lost a lot of pep that I normally had. It's confusing. I still have a positive outlook on life, but it just seems I've mellowed way down. Last night I went to Steak'n Shake with Chris, Jermey and Mike. I had hot tea, then we went back to Chris' and watched a horror-esqe movie since it was Halloween. Marshall e-mailed me and told me we'll more than likely play Athens on the 19th at the Union. Jess! You should come if your car is able to make it. That would be so lovely meeting, then after we play, we could walk down to the Donkey and I could buy you a coffee and a vegan peanut-butter cookie!"

"event","Ever since school has started, I've felt extremely lonely. I haven't really bothered to make an effort to get to know anyone since I'm such a shy person. I spend most of my time alone working on assignments, and I usually eat lunch alone in the cafeteria between classes. I enjoy it, but I wish someone would come over and sit with me because there is a small handfull of interesting looking people. Other than those few, everyone else reminds me of people that I went to high school with. They're very dull and come off as fake. It's horrible. Hopefully Winter quarter will be better since I'll have art and photogaphy. 

Back to watching Eternal Sunshine. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it. It's beautiful."

"event","it's funny how smells and sounds can remind you of things from the past. i love the smell of autumn. an old man burning brush in a field near his home is a comfort to me. i fell asleep to a blues cassette i found in my brother's closet that he left when he moved out a few years ago. it's really smooth. i'd like to be in a lounge with the smells of alcohol and cigarette smoke even though i don't enjoy those smells. it just seems appropriate. looking out in the city while a jazz band plays while the red blinking dots on top of buildings warn airplanes if they come to close. a dimly lit lounge where neon wraps around the bottom of the bar while mostly waiters shuffle back and forth with mix drinks and towels hung over their arms. just some place that's calming. somewhere i could be lost but not care. this is very random, but i just like writing about things that may comfort whoever reads this if somebody happens to stumble across this."

"event","I set out on a narrow way many years ago 
Hoping I would find true love 
Along the broken road 
But I got lost a time or two 
I wiped my brow and kept pushing through 
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to You 

That every long lost dream 
Led me to where You are 
Others who broke my heart 
They were like northern stars 
Pointing me on my way 
Into Your loving arms 
This much I know is true 
That God blessed the broken road 
That led me straight to You 

I think about the years I spent just passing through 
I'd like to have them back again 
And give them all to You 
But You just smile and take my hand 
You've been there and You understand 
It's all part of a grander plan 
That is coming true 

That every long lost dream 
Led me to where You are 
Others who broke my heart 
They were like northern stars 
Pointing me on my way 
Into You loving arms 
This much I know is true 
That God blessed the broken road 
That led me straight to You 
Now I keep rolling on into You loving arms 
This much I know is true 
That God blessed the broken road 
That led me straight to You


...this is how i wish i felt<//3
knowing i at least have some one..??"

"event","As a jaunt from the drudgery of last night's lesson plan writing, I took this Jungian personality test I stumbled upon while myspacing.   According to Carl Jung, I have an INFJ temperment.  While some of this is right on the money, other parts of it leave me scratching my head.  If you know me well, please tell me what you think :)  The INFJ personality description follows.............

The Counselor Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in reaching their goals, and directive and introverted in their interpersonal roles. Counselors focus on human potentials, think in terms of ethical values, and come easily to decisions. The small number of this type (little more than 2 percent) is regrettable, since Counselors have an unusually strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their companions. Although Counsleors tend to be private, sensitive people, and are not generally visible leaders, they nevertheless work quite intensely with those close to them, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes with their families, friends, and colleagues. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and people. 

Counselors can be hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except with those they trust. With their loved ones, certainly, Counselors are not reluctant to express their feelings, their face lighting up with the positive emotions, but darkening like a thunderhead with the negative. Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact. At the same time, friends who have known a Counselor for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that they are inconsistent; Counselors value their integrity a great deal, but they have intricately woven, mysterious personalities which sometimes puzzle even them. 

Counselors have strong empathic abilities and can become aware of another's emotions or intentions -- good or evil -- even before that person is conscious of them. This ""mind-reading"" can take the form of feeling the hidden distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other types to comprehend. Even Counselors can seldom tell how they came to penetrate others' feelings so keenly. Furthermore, the Counselor is most likely of all the types to demonstrate an ability to understand psychic phenomena and to have visions of human events, past, present, or future. What is known as ESP may well be exceptional intuitive ability-in both its forms, projection and introjection. Such supernormal intuition is found frequently in the Counselor, and can extend to people, things, and often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge, premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come, as well as uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance.

"event","It's colder than nuts in my apartment and I love it.  I have my gas fireplace roaring at full throttle. And I'm, yet again, postponing that obligatory late-December scavenger hunt.  Shopping is my least favorite part of Christmas, so corporate, so nerve racking. I hate it. What is the point, really?  These days we buy gift certificates or give cash just to receive it in return. We end up standing in line to exchange frumpy sweaters, oversized undies, and garish DVD holders, those last minute gifts purchased in that spirit of Yule tide desperation to get something, anything, wrapped and under the artificial tree. 
Christmas is not about presents.  It's about getting toasted while making tamales with grandma. It's about hanging around at mom's house in sweats with my brothers and sisters, watching movies and laughing like we were still kids.  Wrap me up a dozen tamales... that's all I want for Christmas.   
I hope that Christmas, the tamales, and the warmth of hot cocoa will help melt my icy feelings of late.  For now, I'm just moving through my bitterness, laughing and joking around about painful situations seems to help.  I'm spending lots of time with good friends who I love so much and have saved my sanity... If you're reading this THANK YOU.  I'm also taking time to myself to be sad and bitter, it's ok to do that.  I've been renting movies too, it's amazing how many old ones have slipped through the cracks.  I was at Casa Video the other day and noticed Caligula sitting there on the shelf and, in the spirit of Christmas, decided to check it out :)"

"event","Since Thursday, I've been trying to squash this damn flu bug to no avail.  This morning I was much less snotty and achy than I had been this weekend, so I dragged my ass out of bed to teach.   Well the ladies I work with told me that I looked like shit and suggested that I go home... so here I am.   I think I will play hookie from the Census sweatshop too. YAY!!! I'm really not all that sick, I just welcome the excuse to use more annual leave.  The R&R wouldn't hurt me anyway. And I have NO desire to be productive around the house.  Rather than conquering that monolithic heap of dirty duds, I'll lounge in sweats and order some Wonton soup from the Mandarin Grill.

Though I ail physically, these days I'm in a better place mentally (once you read this you may not think so... but I really am).  Let me explain why...

I've realized that my rose colored glasses are of no use to me anymore.  I give up wondering why I can't wipe away the indelible splatters of mud. I will no longer scotch tape their mangled frames or squint through their cracked lenses...to the trash they go.  It's time to take them off and see things as they really are. A tainted optimism has blurred my vision for at least the last several months.  Please don't misunderstand, it's NOT that I've abandoned ALL hope.  It's just that I now realize I have misplaced my optimism.
  
No amount of hope can turn a tumbleweed into a rosebush.  And I know now that what I thought was just wilted is, in fact, totally spent and withered.  Not even all the love and nurturing in the world, much less mine, can breathe life into what is dead.  I will no longer hope for what is impossible. That would only cause more me heartache.  My hope now is not to revive lost love, but to sow friendship on more stable and fertile ground.

But first I will rant a bit.
It hurts that he never gave me a second thought, that he didn't take my feelings into consideration. Is it self absorbed to think that maybe he toyed with my feelings? How could I have trusted my feelings with someone so fickle?  No... I cannot fault somebody for doing what I should have ALWAYS done...looking after my OWN feelings before anyone else's.  I am the only constant in my life.  I trust in me.  I am thankful for my wonderful friends and supportive family, but unless I love myself, all is lost.  I'm optimistic that, one day, I'll be able to love myself.

I cannot expect a person to give me more than he is able.  I cannot hate him for not being what I  want him to be. I cannot long for romance where there is just platonic friendship.  Instead I must find a place where my love is valued and reciprocated.  That is where my hope must rest.
 
I know that I need to accept my friends as they are, me as I am, and not to bemoan life for being different than I wish it was.  Only then can I move forward.  I let go of my expectations."

"event","Holding true to tradition, here is another one of my sporadic and bitchy blogs.  I'm not sure just where to start.  My life seems so simple and yet I have so much to bemoan.  Rather than delving into anything to serious and personal right away, I'll start by griping about the two things that are annoying me the most at this very moment: CHAIN EMAILS and IMMIGRATION.

FWD This:
Don't get me wrong.  I hold no animosity toward the sixty-year-old women and frosty haired gay boys who send me the things, but I will not subject all forty people in my address book to dancing rainbow carebears, even if it means years of bad luck.  Keep the fucking furballs out of my inbox!

La Migra:
I actually received a FWD on this subject.  It is a valid topic of conversation and a perplexing problem to be sure.  What annoys me is that the topic has been beaten more than a horny faggot's dick! I'm just so sick of hearing about it.  I always think it's funny when people find out I'm half Mexican, they say ""Oh.. I would have never guessed"" as if it were some compliment.  It's always entertaining to hear what horrible things some people will say before they find out that you are one of those ""illegal"" Mexicans. ""When did your family come to the States?""... Bitch, my family didn't cross the border, the border crossed us.  Funny, the half of me that did immigrate is the white half.  Guess I wouldn't mind being shipped back to Italy too much at this high point in our nation's history.   

Am I nuts? Maybe just a bit.  But honestly, I waste too much energy biting my tongue.  I've spent my whole life up to this point trying to be humble, polite, and cool as a cucumber, while the whiners, drama queens, and braggarts turn heads and get ahead.  I feel like I need to find a new way of doing things or I will just remain hidden in the background. I guess the background is fine for now, but it is fucking boring.

Well enough of my bitching, when I wake up tomorrow I will feel great having vented way too much on Livejournal.  This is just what happens when I go out, come home grouchy and not quite drunk enough.   Talk to ya again in a couple months :)"

It's so great to be able to wear my furry slippers and PJs, to sleep under the covers without sweating to death, to make a big pot of soup, to go on a hike or run in beautiful weather.  Right now I'm just drinking some hot chai, sitting by the fireplace all nice and toasty.
Things are going pretty well, despite the fact that my life has been very uneventful as of late.   My one bit of excitment is that I am now an uncle!  My little nephew Marquise is already a month old, and is the spitting image of my brother Matthew.  I will post pictures soon I think.

I am finally getting out of this rut that I have been in for the past few weeks or so.  Miraculously, my clarinet has avoided an untimely death in the fireplace.  Of course, I could never bring myself to do that.. but that's what the little devil on my shoulder had been whispering in my ear.  As always, I listen to the little Angel and I'm now actually putting some mileage on the old licorice stick.

This weekend I was having coffee with a couple of my friends and the subject of ghosts arose.  My friends talked about seeing ghosts as if it was an everyday thing. They had many stories to tell, they had seen people, pets, my friend Anthony told me about an over-excited ghostly pooch knocked him over when he said ""here doggie doggie doggie"". I was a little embarrased to admit that I have neither seen nor heard a ghost.  I have felt eerie presences, but does that really count?  The general concensus among my friends was that everybody perceives the supernatural differently.  Since that conversation I have been curious about what it is like to see a ghost, and whether or not I have any kind of ""sixth sense"".  Just out of curiousity, what have your experiences been? Have you ever seen or do you believe in ghosts or a sixth sense?  Sorry if this sounds a bit odd..."

That, and I'm just letting the place air out.  My whole house reeks of the salmon I cooked earlier.  All the rain, thunder, and fish funk has my cat Mya going apeshit.  It's so good to be home :)
My day started with me stumbling out of bed and rushing to my supa dupa fly job at the Census.  I spent 7 hours coercing reluctant victims in to telling me everything there is to know about their companies' health insurance. What's more exciting than that?
My first rehearsal with TSO went pretty well, knock on wood.  The members of the clarinet section are all very friendly and fine players.  I hung fairly well, in the section, except that I just can't play as loud as they can, wow!  So I get to miss teaching at my first school tomorrow because of rehearsal, and have concerts on Thursday and Friday.
Well i guess that's it for tonight. Time to feed the vicious, brush my teeth, and go to bed. Ciao"

"event","Looking back through my old posts, I realize a lot in my life has changed since I last visited my journal.
Here are just a few things:
I finally made it through my Masters Program. No more school for a while :)
I'm now an uncle
I live in a new place (near 4th Ave.) 
Started working an extra job to make ends meet.
I know I have a record of posting sporadically, mostly because I just don't get around to doing it.  Also, it seems like what I had to say was either me bemoaning life or was just not interesting.  So, from now on I will just write about day to day stuff, interesting or not, and try to keep my bitching to a minimum.
Here it goes.
It was nice to see everyone who was at Wyona's party last night !!! It has been forever since I've seen you guys, and it was nice to be able to hang out for a while.
Today was pretty decent day.  I slept in, made my weekly ration of homemade salsa, then practiced for a while.  Then I went to see ""Carmen"" down at TCC with my friend Mark.  It was a good show, we sat second row so we could see everyone, and knew many of the chorus members.  The baritone, the dude who played Escamillo, was really hot- very handsome and what a great voice.  After that we did dinner at Pei Wei and I went home and practiced some more.  While I was practicing, the phone rang, and I listened to my friend Ying's long tirade about the guy who is fixing her clarinet.  
I was glad that I made it out to do my two laps around Reid park, even though I didn't get there until about 9pm.  It was a gorgeous night out, and it was nice to just look and the moon, smell the wet grass, feel the cool breeze.  I'm so glad Autumn is finally here.  I started running fairly regularly about a month ago, and I found it really difficult to start.  Now it is just a matter of getting my ass out there and doing it; every week it seems like I can go a little bit farther.  I find this to be a really good time to just clear my head, reflect, and think things through.  It's funny, whatever is bugging at the moment me seems not quite so bad.
Well I guess it's time for bed.  I have a long week ahead of me: work, teaching, and a gig with the Tucson  Symphony Orchestra :) I finally get to sub with them.  I hope it goes well, since this gig is the one ray of sunshine in the midst of much dark disenchantment with the clarinet.  I'm excited :)"

It is not a holiday, but some say it is something to be celebrated.
It is not made with yeast, but it may contain some.
It can be doughy or crusty, most prefer it without the crust.
It is warm, wholesome, and satisfying.
It is best not eaten day-old.
It cums in many flavors.

"event","Gluttony has been my theme for the last couple days.  Yesterday, John and Mary served up some damn fine curry with all the fixins (bananas, apples, boiled egg, coconut, mango chutney, raisins, almonds, cashews, bacon yogurt), three bowls of it to be exact.  Today I went to my folks' house, my Dad had a pan of his famous lasagna waiting for me.  MMMMMM, I'm stuffed.  So much for losing some weight before the New Year.  I honestly do not know how I had the will power to diet successfully a few years back.  I used to tip the scales at 250, and went down to 150 in less than a year.  That was a whole year without cheese! It kinda sucked.
Family, friends, and food are some life's greatest pleasures.  There are few things I like more than to take a friend out to lunch, or prepare a home-cooked meal.  Growing up, I was always willing to lend Mom a hand in the kitchen as she made tortillas, homemade pasta, soup, and lots of other goodies.  Because of all she taught me, I'm able to cook a halfway decent meal, and very quick to appreciate good food.   For that I'm thankful =)  I'm also genetically inclined to be big-boned.  Please substitute fast metabolism for prehensile penis as one of my three wishes (see Dec. 11 blog).  In my family, eating has always been social, recreational, a ritual more than just face stuffing.  My grandmas, mom, and tias pride themselves in cooking ability; and to ask for seconds is the ultimate compliment.  I've always been happy to oblige =)
I would love to have the same passion for physical activity that I have for food.  To be in decent shape, I think thats what it will come down to.  Deprivation is just not an option.  So I will make up for my indulgences....tomorrow maybe.  Anyone up for a bike ride?
Speaking of food.  There is this food called ""breadnight"".  Can any Spanish speakers help me decipher the ingredients?  There will be a post dedicated to this delightful delicacy in the not-so-distant future."

As usual, there has been a big lapse in my postings.  So I'm gonna write a few lines just cuz i havn't done it in so long.  Today was pretty cool, I swung by the street fair with my buds, Ying, Gayl, Jessie, and Alex.  We walked around and ""window shopped"", then had lunch at this new place on 4th avenue that serves really humongous sandwiches.  I had a great time with them.  Then I went to the Saturday coffee group thingy that I usually attend.  I hung out there a few hours, drank too much coffee,  and here I am.
During coffee, one guy posed this question to the group: ""If you could have God change one aspect of you, physically, mentally or otherwise, what would it be?""    There were several interesting answers.  One of the guys, Michael, said that he would wish for a pair of wings.  I thought that was a cool answer. I sometimes dream about flying, except it is really more like swimming through the air.
I honestly couldn't say what I would wish for, so I did my usual thing and came up with some funny bullshit. I wished for a prehensile penis.  It's not that I didn't know what I would wish for, as usual, I just had difficulty putting it into words. 
I wish for the ability to take action.  I'm so guilty of thinking and not doing, listening and not speaking, worrying and not trying.   The answer seems so simple, just do it.  But that is not my nature, and I'm starting to believe that old addage ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"".  So used to putting off writing that paper until the night before its due, calling it a night instead of staying up and practicing, having a crush and not even flirting, I feel like I bullshit my way through life.  That is not to say that my life up to this point has been a total waste, it hasn't.  I just think that my fear of taking action is my Achilles' heel.  It has crippled me from being as happy as I can be.  I know simply trying doesn't guarantee success, but at least I'd know I gave it one hundred percent.
Do I get three wishes?  If so I'm stuck with a wrap-around penis, I'm a total go-getter, and I still have one more wish left.  Hmmmm how about those wings, would be cool to be able to morph into an eagle whenever I want.
I've gone through a lot this past month.  Only now that the semester is coming to a halt am I getting a few free moments to reflect.  So please excuse this psycho-babble. There will be more to come later, hehe.
Because of the street fair craziness, I parked really far away, at park and sixth.  Michael offered to walk me to my ride.  How sweet of him.  We just jabbered about Harry Pooter as we walked, and I gave him a lift the rest of the way to his place.  He's a really nice guy and I'm glad to have him as a bud.
Despite all the soul-searching, I'd say today was a really good day :)"

"event","Well I have so much to rant about since I last posted that I don't even know where to begin....
****** Election 2004:  ""Four more years"" has been echoing through my          nightmares for the past few months.  Nov 2 seems like it was ages ago. The hope of a new president and America's return to sanity now seems like it was just a foggy dream.   The only reason I'm not more upset about Bush's re-election, and I'm pretty pissed, is because I've feared it since day one of the campaign.  Even preparing myself for the worst, I found it hard to stomach that almost NOTHING I voted for passed.  Not a week has gone by, and Dubya's already playing Battleship.  So the elephant stomps us down for another four years. Lets just hope we're tough enough to stick it out, and sane enough to vote Donkey in 2008.  I cant help but feel a little responsible for the outcome. Sure, I did my part and voted.  Next election I will be more inclined to take a rubber dildo and knock some sense into those fucking republicans and NONVOTERS. Lets make a difference people!     
*******Sick:  I meant to bitch about being sick today, but there is really not much to say xcept that I feel like shit and have to write a lesson plan and maybe practice a bit before my own lesson tomorrow. Ha,.  I'm also tired of school.  Things are getting so busy I can hardly stand it.  What a time to get sick, I sure hope it's not the flu.
OK ENOUGH BITCHING, this weekend was kinda fun.  I went down to that Orange County Choppers show in Tempe with Mary and John, which was a blast except for standing in line for 2 hours to get autographs. We did Mad-Libs in the car. I got a cool T shirt:). When I got back to town, I went to have coffee at Rainbow Planet.  I joined a group of online guys who go there regularly on Saturday afternoons.  I've met some really cool guys there, platonic friends of course. The I went to the TSO concert, Mary was playing.  Sunday was a big lazy waste of time, which was nice, and here I am on Monday night, sick putting off doing my work.  Hope I'm better tomorrow."

At least I'll try to make my journal a bit interesting this time, instead of just an endless bitchfest.  To all my Livejournal homies, it is great to see you again!!!
It is cold and rainy outside, a beautiful and absolutely wonderful night just to lounge at home and do nothing.  I'm supposed to be studying for my Music History Quiz tommorrow, so far I've just accomplished printing out the outlines.  Ever suffer from insomnia?  Let me tell you, studying the Renaissance motet is the perfect cure.  Just ask and I'll burn you a copy of the listening CD. Mya (my vicious pet siamese) is keeping me company.  She is bouncing off the walls, as usual.
Nothing all that exciting went on today.   Yesterday was much more fun.  I hung out iwth Emma and Susan for a while, so good to see them.  We went out for dinner at Eldorado.  After that, I joined Mark and Mary for a few drinks at Woody's.  It was underwear night.  The boys looked so cute, that is, the staff who were wearing boxer briefs.  One of the guys, Kirk, looked especially hot.  He was wearing a shimmery rainbowy thong, which he filled out very nicely.  Normally thongs do nothing for me, but in this case, hot hot hot.    Then there was the leather clad brigade, 300 pound men with matching vests and thongs... stinky!  Mary is so cool. She decided to show of her Victoria's Secret Bra.  My pants and shirt stayed on my body.  A fun night all in all.   Better get my ass to bed."

That changed when summer arrived and my roomie flew the coop   During the middle of May, Nathan moved back to Sierra Vista; he was kind enough to give me almost a week's notice.

For those of you in the know, Craig's dad's voice is ringing incessantly in my ears.  I need a to find a J O B in a major way.  So that is one of the projects on my long list to do before the end of the semester.  Working in schools has its pros and cons: namely that you get summers off.  I really love being a musician, but it sure doesn't pay very dependably.  Most of the gigs I've played lately have been freebies, and prospects this summer don't look much brighter.  So I guess I'll resort to being a smooth operator.   Yes, the ole call center deal again.  At my last job, I was a 411 operator... ""city and state please:)""  It was good money and made for some really funny phone stories, but it was kinda nerve racking.  Maybe I should look for something that uses a few less brain cells."

So I'll recap my week as it has gone thus far,  please try not to yawn.

Saturday was actually really fun.   I spent most of the day with Emma and Carrie at the big yard sale.  I managed to make one sale, which paid for 15 minutes of parking this morning. Emma bought my too big tuxedo shirt. It was fun gabbing with Carrie and Emm, watching all the little old Mexican ladies rifle through Emma's old knick knacks, and meeting Emma's neighbor Joy.  Joy was funny.  Though I missed the field-trip that Carrie took over Joy's backyard chicken coop/jacuzzi grotto, I did manage to catch a glimpse of her pink old-lady-panties as she changed in plain view of the street.  I rounded out the evening by going to the Venture'N with Noel and Dan.

Easter was fun.  I spent the whole day at Reid Park eating carne asada, and playing kickball with my aunts, uncles and little cousins.  My mom gave me a really nice easter basket, and a new shirt.

Monday was ok.  I performed ""Shepherd on the Rock"" in a concert with Mark, and a soprano that goes to the U.  She looked like Ms. America, HOT!  The concert went really well too.

Yesterday was just a normal ole school day.  I watched Matrix revolutions for the first time, really good.  For those of you who havn't taken my quiz (SHAME ON YOU :P) it should give you a hint to one of the correct answers.

Today was just as uneventful as yesterday. I just finished a dinner consisting of a can of chicken noodle soup, and some cheez-its. yum.  Well I'm SURE you must be yawning by now.  Later."

I'm really zonked, I stayed up way past my bedtime, and woke up way too early.  So I'm just piddling around, putting off working on that presentation.  I'm going to have dinner with Noel and Dan tonight, it should be yummy.  Willard, our plumber, is supposed to come over in a while and fix the garbage disposal.  It came detatched from the sink on Thursday, and we havn't been able to use the sink or the dishwasher since.  I like my pad, it is big and cheap.  But it is SO ghetto!!!  Things are always breaking, the plumbing is always backing up.  It's such a pain in the ass to bail 6 inches of sewer water out of the bathroom and hallway. 
In other news, I went to that competition at ASU yesterday...  I was one of the losers.  At least it's over.  And what better way to spend a Sunday than to drive up to Phoenix for no damn reason ? I'm not too upset anymore, I've been a musician long enough to be used to the routine.I drove by Hamburger Mary's after the ill fated performance, boy was it packed.  I wasn't in such a festive mood so I headed back to Tucson. I had quiet drink at Woodys a little later with the boys.  And thats about it, now the Family Guy DvD is on, I'm gonna watch!"

I started getting ready to head over there, but realized the thought of going anywhere tonight (especially around gay boys) just made me cringe.  I hate being in this kind of a mood!  I guess I could have just gone out, a martini and some company might do some good. Tried that before, but people can just tell I'm bummed and really don't want to be there.  And all that gloom has a way of rubbing off on other people.  Sorry about the griping. This post sux so much. So maybe I'll go read some Harry Potter. That should cheer me up, no?"

Mya has been shedding like crazy. Umm that's about all that's going on here.  What a beautiful day!  I should go on a bike ride, except I'm waiting for my friend Ying Hsu to call me and pick her up from the car rental place.  She and her accompanist, Svetlana, went to El Paso this weekend for a competition.  I have a concert to go to a little later, nothing but clarinet and bassoon duets.  It should be interesting, I guess.  Ugghh I'm still really bored.
Oh well.
Yesterday was more fun.  I was really lazy, I didn't really get a good night's sleep so I took like a 3 hour nap.  The the EMMANATOR came over to get me and we did the happy hour thang at Crapplebees.  Kelly drove in from Phoenix and met us there just as we were about to leave.  She is such a sweetie pie.  When I got back home, Joe was still at the crib, playing video games with Nathan.  We hung out and bullshitted, and by the time I remembered that it was time for me to get ready to go to Al's recital, it was already a quarter 'til 8. I'm dissapointed that I missed it, God I'm such a scatterbrain. So Joe and I convinced Nathan to go to IBT's.   There were lots of people from gay.com there.  I also saw Kim, Chris, and Kelly.  I wish we wouldn't have left so soon. We went to the Venture'N, which scared the panties off Joe, so we left right away.   We ended the night at Woody's which was, as I suspected, dead. And that was that.
So now I think I will practice for a while or read Harry Potter.  Later."

I typed out my last livejournal entry, and it wasn't posted!  I probably did something DUMB like close the window, rather than submitting my entry.
SO.... I will try to remember what the fuck I wrote in my last entry.
The basic gist of it was about going out on Tuesday night.  Me and Laura met up with Joe and Mary (not the clarinet-playing-Indiana-Jones-fan or the ass-grabbing-Puckers-chugger) at Kon-Tiki. This Mary is Joe's fag-hag, and good friend.  It was her 21st birthday, and we started the night with some scorpions.  Nathan arrived a little later, and we went on to the Biz, the Buffet and IBTS.  Mary and Joe just kept on getting drunker and sillier as the night progressed.  Joe kept on making very audible comments about gay sex and hot men, he really cracked me up :)  Eventually, Laura and I got tired and left IBTS around midnight.  Laura commented on how hyper they were, even compared to her, the usual hyper-person-of-the-group.  They were literally bouncing off the walls, grinding on the dance floor, having a good ole time.  As usual, I was the annoyingly sedate and boring member of the flock. I coulda used some of their energy, but I was really zonked :P
I as a drove Laura home, we chatted a bit.  It surprised me when Laura said that she was kinda uptight when she was younger.  She is always so spunky and chipper.  She said that her friend Jake helped loosen her up a bit.  I think, slowly but surely, my buds are helping me loosen up also.  I am thankful to have such good friends.  Laura told me all about her Sedona trip and her new girlie, Alexa.   She sounded very happy, I'm really glad things are going so well for her.  I enjoyed spending time with Laura, we havn't hung out much at all these days.
In other news, there is not a whole helluva lot going on with me.  I am gonna go see that Catfish Roe concert tonight, Laura and Mary (the Indy girl) and Noel are playing in it.   That should be great! I just got back from working out, so my sweaty ass (ewww) is going to hit the showers."

"event","So, part of my spring break project was to get my overdue library books returned.  I had about thirty or so overdue library books and music scores hiding in various and sundry places in my apartment.  I turned in most of them yesterday.  I checked my email today so that I could see what my late fees ended up to be.  One Hundred and Ninety Five Dollars!!!!  I nearly shat myself.  The reason the late fee is so high, is because two of the items are so overdue, they were billed for replacement cost, at 90$ each.  The problem with just turning those two books in that I can't find all the pieces to them.  They are trios with flute, clarinet, and bassoon parts, and some of parts are missing.  So I have to call some people I performed with, see if they have the parts.  Arrrgh, what a headache!!!!   I'm sure the fine will go down, once I return everything.  So this is the price I pay for procrastinating.  You would think I would have learned my lesson by now.
Today was easy, since I have a break from orchestra and only had two classes today.  I am supposed to go to my little sister Jessica's basketball banquet tonight, which should be really fun.  I can't believe this is her senior year in HS  I feel so old."

This weekend was actually pretty fun
On Friday, I went out to the Denture Inn with Mark and Noel, and drank way too much Jack Daniels.  I had fun, but ended up yacking at Mark's apartment.  I didn't even get to eat my breakfast burrito :(.  I woke up on Saturday with a mild hangover, and spent most of the day on Fourth Avenue at the street fair guy watching.  I saw part of the IBT's drag show, and had a Bloody Mary to help cure my hangover.  My favorite act was Terri Yacki's rendition of Tina Turner. It was hilarious.  Not only were the hair, outfit, and ghetto booty fabulous, the queen imitated  Tina's twitchy and tweaky mannerisms perfectly.   I went home, worked on the yard, took a bubble bath, went to IBT's again with Joe and Nathan.
Today I got to hang out with the EMMANATOR, we did lunch at Yoshimatsu.  Nathan came along too :)  I taught a lesson, then spent the rest of the evening cooking, and reading Hairy Pooter (ooops i mean Harry Potter)and listening to Ghetto slow jams (one of my secret pleasures).  I'm now just sitting here kinda restless, with an awful, foreboding feeling about the long week of school ahead, arrrgh.  Its going to be a busy one, since I've put of working on this oral presentation that I have to do at the beginning of April.  I just found out that I made it into the final round of this Contemporary Music Competition that I entered :) I am going to be one practicing like mad mo fo.

I've got a few things accomplished so far: I'm still busy teaching, managed to get some laundry done, started hacking away at the jungle in my back yard.  I've been hanging out with Mary a lot, which has been really fun.  We went and taught together on Monday, and may go again tomorrow.  There are a lot of things I still havn't gotten around to doing: homework, practicing (I'll get to that), partying (tomorrow:), and getting laid (who knows when). Men continue to baffle me, as I'm sure I baffle them.  So, I've resolved not to worry about them TOO much for the time being, just go with the flow.  I went to the Biz's Sunday Latin Night for the first time in like a year.  It was really fun.  I forgot what a blast Latin night is.  I hung out with this guy I met online, Phil, and some of his friends, cool guys.  I am a really bad dancer, but spent most of the night dancing anyway, hehe.

I spent the weekend with old guys, hehe.  Old guys rock. Last night, Noel's partner and three of his friends (all over 60) came to watch the concert.  After the concert, we went to the Denture in and had some drinks.  I had a blast, and got a little toasted too.
I was suprised how well the concerts this weekend went.  The President's Concert features student soloists who won a concerto competition last fall.  All the soloists (including Kara, the girl who beat me)sounded great.  I managed to get a few compliments too, for my solo at the beginning of Rhapsody in Blue.  I'm starting to realize that when I don't constantly worry about fucking up, or beat myself up for losing at things, I actually play ok.  I had been getting so sick of playing lately.  I'm glad to be able to see more things clearly now.  All I need to do is PLAY, be confident, prepared, have fun.  That, I can do :0) 
I finished my Abe Lincoln book, just in time for President's Day.  Now I need a new one.  Maybe the Godfather or the next Don Juan book.  I guess I'll haul my Broke Ass to Bookman's tomorrow.  Well, I'm off to Susan's, surprise party, (I hope she's not reading this right now :).

Me, Laura, John and Mary had stopped at Wal Fart to get supplies for our adventure.  Plans changed when this lady backed into Mary's beautiful new car as we were leaving the parking lot. Crunch :(  The Lady didn't have her license, only a Mexican visa.  She did have insurance, so things are all good.  Mary just had to spend like an hour on the phone with Geico.  We hung at Mary's house the rest of the afternoon; ordered pizza; watched this instructional video on female masturbation; tuned in to the Queer Eye marathon on Bravo.  After that, I headed to my grandpa's house to catch some of the super bowl.  I'm not a football fan, but I do love hot wings.  They were all gone by the time I got there :(.  I ended up watching the last quarter of the game, which was surprisingly action-packed and enjoyable.  It didn't hurt that both teams' QB's are hot ass mofos!

Woohoo!!!  I get to take lessons again, which is both exciting and scary.  My playing has really been below par lately, and I need to get back with it.   I've had a hard time staying motivated to practice.   We are playing some cool pieces in Orchestra, including Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue.  That is giving me a little more incentive to practice.  I've been pretty good about keeping with the workout schedule.  Me and Noel have been lifting weights at the Student Rec Center at the asscrack of dawn.  I am off to teach at noon today.  
later."

"event","I realize that writing a journal entry first thing in the morning is pretty dumb, since nothing has happened yet.  Oh well.  I just end up rehashing the past day's events anyway.  
So I guess I'll start from Saturday night. Me and Noel ventured out for the evening to this bar, the Venture'N.  The bois and I jokingly call it the Denture Inn because of its older clientele.  There really is a diverse mix of guys that go there.  There are not too many places in town where you can run into a leather-clad Santa.  Most of the guys who go there are of the middle-aged, blue collar set.  Then there are the leather guys, the older guys, us, and the occasional Abercrombie boi that gets bored at IBT's.    
It was a fun night, and we saw quite a few of our buds there.  Noel was nice enough to drive, so I had maybe one too many drinks, hehe.  We were hanging out by the pool table, and in walk our friends, Manuel and Tony.  I hadn't seen them since their xmas party at the beginning of December.  We hung out with them for a while, they are great guys, so funny and friendly.   I admit, I am really attracted to Manuel.  He is gorgeous, stylish, and has a smile that lights-up the room.  Besides that, he is super sweet, a very kind person.  I tried not to flirt too much, since I was a little tipsy and all.  Arrgh, I feel like such a wuss.  I just need to get the balls to invite him to a movie or dinner.  I would really like to get to know him better.
Yesterday was our workout day.  I spent the morning with family, then went running.  After the run, Noel invited me to stay and have dinner with him and Ed, his partner.   Noel made mole, which came out really yummy.  I really enjoy Noel's company, I'm glad we're becoming such good friends.
My sis just called her car isn't starting.  I'm gonna jet and take her to buy a new battery.  Later, me and Mark are going to reahearse.  Teaching begins tomorrow, arrggh.   That means I need to write a lesson plan today. I better jam, Ciao!"

"event","I just got back home from hanging out with my family.  Seems like I've been spending a lot of time with them lately, which is nice.  We went to my little cousin's first birthday party today. It was at Peter Piper Pizza.   PP is the most ghetto, funnest, cheapest pizza joint in town.  They serve beer, which makes it even better.  I decided to lay off the brew today, and just grubbed and helped the littl'uns win tickets at skee-ball.  So now I'm just chillin for the moment, sitting here as sore as hell. 
Me and Noel did our workout yesterday, it is starting to become a routine.  We went running by the river, and Noel showed me some leg exercises.   After I took my little bro home from work this morning, we and the dogs went for a voyage through the desert.  That earned me some pig out points for today, hehe :)
As I left my parents' Mary called me to tell me that she and John are back in town. Yay!  I'm gonna go hang out with them in a minute.  May go out with the bois( Mark and Noel) a little later too.  ciao."

Feliz Ano Nuevo!!!
This New Year's Eve was a pretty quiet one.   I spent some time at my Mom and Dad's house, got my grub on, went to my Grandparents', ate some more, made in to Emma and Susan's place in time to ring in the New Year.  I had a nice time at Emma's.   Some of Susan's really cool friends were there, Carrie and Jeff, Kendra, Mary.  They are such a riot!!!  I watched Mary polish of a bottle of puckers.  She grabbed my ass, haha.  It was funny.  I took it easy on the booze, so I didn't participate in the karaoke.   I left about 1, but had a good time.  
New Years is not one of my favorite holidays.  What ruins it for me is the whole, ""having someone to kiss at midnight"" thing.  This year,like most, I was rolling solo.  Oh well. I tried not to let that bug me too much. I'm used to being single, and okay with it right now, I guess.  WhenI think about it more, though, I realize how nice it would be to have a special guy in my life. Anyway.  Should that be one of my resolutions?  
My first resolution is to get back in shape.  I have starting to work out again, over winter break, and it is really energizing.  I am also going to concentrate on practicing, competing, auditioning, finding a job.  It is time for that.  Uhhh, there are others too.
I spent most of New Year's Day with my little Bro and Sis.  We went to go watch Lord of the Rings, very cool.  Later, me and my bro took the dogs for a walk.  On our walks we usually gab the whole time.  Sometimes it is just bullshit.  This time he was telling me about how much he looks forward to moving out of my parent's house.  I think it wil be good for him. I realized that at this time last year, I was in the same position.   I moved in with Emma, Jan 1 last year.  It was great living with her, I miss it.  I am glad to be on my own, and thankful for the great friends that I have met this year. :)"

"event","It's colder than balls in my apartment!   I must have got down into the twenties again last night.  I fell asleep reading Huck Finn last night, and forgot to turn on the heater.  Not smart.  I'm here at Nate's computer, bundled up in a grey sweatsuit, teeth chattering.  On the up-side, I was finally able to get on the 'net to check my grades.  I didn't flunk. WOO HOO!!  I ended up getting a C in Dr. Murphy's  History of Speculative Theory class.  I was sure that I failed that bitch.  I got B's in my two other academics, an A in orchestra, of course.  So I guess forvgive you, Santa, for taking a dump in my stocking. 
Yesterday was fun.  I went on a run with Noel.  Hehe Noel rocks.  He is sexy too, in great shape.  We have made a pact to go running every other day, lets see how long we will stick to that.  We ran down by the Rillito ""river"", which is close to where we live.  We jogged for about a mile on the north bank, crossed, and ran back on the opposite side.  Most rivers in Arizona are funny.   They are usually dry.  When you do see a substantial flow in the Rillito, you can be sure that the rest of Tucson is flooded.
Later, I went to the movies with Emma, my former roomie, and her niece, Heaven.  We watched a movie called Love Don't Cost a Thing, a Black film that had a plot identical to the 80's flick, Can't Buy Me Love.  It was funny.  I went over to Emma and Susan's (Susan is her fine fiance) and ate some of Emma's yummy, homemade pizza.  Kelly and Nadia were there too.   It was fun hangin' out with them.   
Hehe, so I guess I'll be back here the next time I'm up at the crack of dawn. Ciao baby:)"

"event","So, its the day after the day after Christmas, and not a whole lot is shakin'.  Nate got back from SV yesterday at the ass crack of dawn.  I spent most of the day at my parents' house, and just did laundry and bullshitted.  I need to give my little brother a call and see how his puppy is doing.  He got a new Cane Corso puppy, named Lennox, the day after Thanksgiving.  Cane Corsos are hunting mastiffs, originally bred for chasing and bringing down large game.  The puppy is only 10 weeks old, and he must weigh 30 pounds already!  He will be at least 130# when he is fully grown.  Right the pup is suffering from this condition called ""cherry eye"".   It is really gross.  A gland in the puppy's eye is prodruding from the eye socket.   It is red, swollen, and looks something like a cherry, hence the name of the condition.  I hope he is ok. 
I have to go practice in a while, so this entry is a bit short.  Oooh, looks like a nice day for a bike ride! Love, peace and chicken grease! :)"

I thought this was funny:
from a song ""Back Door Santa"" by Clarence Carter:
       ""I ain't like Old Saint Nick, he don't come but
        once a year......I keep some change in my pocket
        in case the children at home, i give 'em a few
        pennies so we can be alone.""  Hehe

   I just got home from my granny's house, and boy, am I stuffed.  I'm a little sleepy too.  After a night of Yule Tide libations at Woody's, my xmas day started pretty early.   
   I got up at 645 to pick up my little bro from work.  We went to my parents' house, and walked the dogs while we waited for the sisters to get out of bed.  It was a nice morning for a walk.  Everyone in the neighborhood was busy opening their gifts, so Tyson and Rocky got to run around the park for a while.  They are wuff and wowdy wogs :).  Tyson is a grey pit bull puppy.  Rocky is about 2 years old, a black and white pit bull mix.  The other two dogs, Hazel and Lenox, stayed home.
   We opened presents soon after we got home, everyone seemed to be very happy with their gifts. Dad seemed unimpressed, though :(.  Santa was pretty nice to me, despite my naughtiness this year.  I got some $, cologne, socks, t-shirts, a new wallet.  What more could a guy want?  
   We headed over to gramma and gramps' house.  There was chaos as a dozen younger cousins tore open their gifts.  It was nice hanging with the family for a little while.  I left gramma's house with a new shirt, some way-too-big chonies, trail mix, and a tummy full of some damn fine tamales:)  
   Now I'm debating whether I should practice or take a nap. HMMM. I'll figure it out.  I may go out a little later, hehe, what a lush I am:) Ciao..."

"event","I'm just hanging here at home, waiting for the roast in the oven to cook.  Smells yummy.   A little later I will go take care of the kitty I am sitting, Indiana.  She is my friend Mary's cat.  Mary and John are away for the holiday, so I am in charge of their vicious.  She is a fiesty one, and she looks like a teenaged version of Emma's old kitty, Wyona.   Mary and John are awesome.  I can't wait 'til they get back so we can hang out more. They are total Indiana Jones buffs, hence their kitty's name.  Their apartment is decked out with movie posters, and  other memorabilia.   What is really cool is the Indiana jones whip they have.  Mary jokes that she should bring it into her music lessons and crack it.  Haha, sounds like a good idea to me.  Mary is a music teacher, like I am.  We are both clarinet players and grad students.  Yeah, and I sure like the playing part more than the student part.  I'm so enjoying my break right now, nice to be able to be a bum for once.  Nothing stressful right now, except Christmas. 
   Christmas shopping, the one thing that usually makes the holidays a chore for me, was virtually painless this year.  I got the bulk of my shopping done yesterday.  I only had to wait in line at Worst Buy, and boy was that a long line!  It wrapped around the whole friggin' store. I only have one gift left to buy, a Diana Ross CD for my brother.  Yeah, that surprised me too.  This is a departure from his usual Tupac, Wu Tang, Dirty South fare.  I prefer to bump the Supremes to Sisqo any day.
  Well, I better check the stove, and get to the Christmasly errands.  I'm out :)"

"event","Well, I don't have a whole lot to say right now.  I just got home from a bar down the street called Woody's, hehe, I said Woody.  I was supposed to meet my buddy, Noel, there at 11.   I called him after I finished my first beer, he hadn't yet left home.  The bar was packed. But for some reason, I just didn't feel like hanging there tonight.  I called him a few minutes later to tell him I was headed home.  I don't think he was too disappointed. I hope not.
  So I got home, tired but not in the mood to call it a night.   My buddy Emma told me, a few days ago, that the Livejournal is now free.  So I'm giving it a shot.  I've tried blogging once before, maybe this time I'll get hooked.  In the meantime, it is a good remedy for being a little bored and restless, hehe.
   Usually, my roomie Nathan is home playing his computer.  He is away in Sierra Vista (about an hour away) visiting his family for the holiday.  It is definitely quiet here in the crib without Nate Dogg here.  He is usually up late playing Star Wars, he is totally addicted :)  He is nice enough to let me use his computer, pretty much whenever I need it.  But yeah, it is nice to have the place to myself, a little lonely though.
  I look over toward the window, and Nate's cat, Mya, is attacking the Christmas lights. I think Nate spells his cat's name M-y-a like the pop-artist. Or is it Maya, like the Indians or the poet, Maya Angelou?  Oh well, cats always have a million names anway, who cares.  My pet name for her is vicious, 'cause she loves to bite and play rough.  She is cute, and is always meowing up a storm.  I often wonder what the fuck she is saying.
   Well, for someone who didn't have a lot to say, I sure did gab.  I am tired now, so I'm out :)."

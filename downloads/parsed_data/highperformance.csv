"event","well, I am so tired. I've taken a second job stocking my local grocery store shelves. So I work all night at that and then go right to landscaping. Then on top of that someone waltzed on in my house and stole my ps2. I can't play gran turismo 4 anymore which i do still have and by the way am very, very skilled at. Sorry to say that and let my ego get the better of me but it does truely bring out the most capable part of me. The point is it sucks I lost out on 130$ dollars and i currently have to work 16 hours to make that back. Fucking assholes. Damn them. I want to assault everyone one of these kids that screw with me like that. Forget them. I feel quite helpless over this."

"event","Where does the time go? Why am I so fast thinking and feeling such paranoia? What the hell? Take me with you. I have a lot of time to make decisions about my time. But no sight of what my actions should be has come to me. This is obvious because of the way I feel about my decisions. I know my fellows need me every minute they hang around. They want my patience and understanding. My attention should be directed to them. I am suffering because I think about my self far too often. And I am not listening to them when they call for me. I need them to bring me back in from the dark. I desire for my Lord to give me guidance I can not override. I believe my Lord can grant me good thoughts. For my head and chest to hold wisdom. Wisdom to change the wrongful sight in my vision. There can be peace for us all now. I want part of that peace. Things should be smooth in our lives right now. Things are not smooth. I have denied my Lord and fellows a place in my heart for sometime. I am letting them enter it now. I feel so alone. It hurts me. I am not strong on my own. I have failed myself. I fail to see the right in a wide open space. I stay locked away in fear of mistakes. There must be a release of my feelings for everything. The things I feel for are terrible and destructive. Self-centeredness and hate. Dishonor and lust, gluttony. Abandon of effort and composure, patience and integrity. Today I can't fight the forces that control me. The one that is killing me must be left behind. Allowing myself to be free is the only way I can progress. Adoring, respecting and protecting the things that I have is my goal today. I shall not lose anymore."

"event","This is going to be incomplete. I can't correct myself as I type so I am going to copy my draft of nonsense that came out over two days.

     I want to give up my selfishness. I wish I could treat you with the respect and force I give my own life. (That needs correcting. If I treated people with that respect I would be harnming more than myself. I mean a higher respect I think I might have.) I've become an addict, selfish and weak and hiding from reality. I am alone in my mind. I don't have the strnghth to go on with this assesment. That's the way I know I am. Weak and powerless to put forth effort and channel it to something other than my satisfaction. I cry here. For my lord. I have had strange dreams, thoughts and probably hallucinations. Some evil tries to conquer my soul. He is powerful and frightening. I don't want to lose myself to him. I don't want to give myself to him when there is work to be done in my life. I become defensive when it is suggested by a person that I should do something I haven't thought of. I am angry. I want to smash things. I want to drink, smoke and forget. I feel like if I could erase my memories I could start something new. Erase my mind with cleansing agents. I am neglecting everybody. My brothers are addicts for sure. I need help. I don't think I ever progressed from childhood in certain aspects of life. I can't give people love. I need to nurtured as I believe I never was. I have will not dircted at another person or by another person when I am clean and sober. It is my lord that directs my will. My will is strong but I give up on it for ease and oblivion. I'm directionless. Strong when directed. A soldier who won't be put down when following orders. I am swift opf mind and coordination,intellectual and powerful. I am as angry as I've ever known. I'm in danger. I need to be helped. Crack go away. Devil, leave me alone. Go back to hell if you treat us this way. I am a keystone in my family. We are now falling apart. Something must repostion me. I am a fool. I don't know what I am or where I want to go. My mind is performing a continuos bullshit session to cover my true motivation: to remain enthralled and entrapped in addicted status, submissive addicted vertigo, making the physically nature of outside entities inaccessible for me. Reliquinshing all patience I am losing control of my thought process which I have excercised to performance in past endeavors. When I need to breathe deeply I breathe smoke deeply. I feel like being assertive but am not assertive when dealing with drugs. I'm not assertive with the people involved i8n drug forays and am not assertive when making decisions for materials used in my actions. I am not unable to control my anger, even though I can not express it positvely. I have no need to express it negatively at others. I can make the distinction of who is responsible. I desire to eliminate situationsI can't control by leaving them alone. Bad situations like dealing with idiots and active addicts other than myself. I belong outdoors much more than I am. I feel relieved when I am outdoors for prolonged lengths. I also dreamed about Diana Stow again this morning. Nothing fancy just that I saw her and her pals walking up a grassy hill and I ran up to her to give her a hug. Somehow I approached her friend first when I had intende it to be Dee. So I gave her a hug first and then Diana. AS I held her she gained heighth over me and my head was in her chest . We had steady eye contact and there was no matter worth solving."

"event","The benefits of being a woodcrafter have expired in my life. I was making 12 dollars an hour. I was great. There was nothing I couldn't do with the fine machines I had at my disposal. I received a four thousand dollar bonus on the tenth of December. Now in three weeks I have ended my career. I have spent the money. I have broken my HiPo car. They warned me a year and more ago that smoking crack was a good way to lose my job. Still I managed to keep it by showing up for work and complying with all other rules but the smoking crack rule. I deserved to lose my job because of the way I was treating it. I didn't look at anyone. They were probably afraid of me in some minute way because it's hard to understand somone that acts like me. Yes I am calculating and cold but that also falls apart. I am very weak now. That's the reason I smoke crack. It's just the easiest way to not deal with anything else. I am afraid someone thinks that livejournal is but a pathetic attempt to communicate with them and that is unnerving. It is not some pathetic attempt at communication. Don't think that. The things I type here are the unknown that I am prolonging. They are not some shot aimed at anyone in particular. I don't know where I am or where you are so I am not looking at anything or anyone. If I was speaking to one person I would be more defined trust me. The uncertainty begins in my mind and is conveyed to yours. Basically I need strength and I am working on it."

But I wasn't thinking when I bid on diamonds I saw on Ebay a couple of days ago. I guess I just wasn't thinking.I am losing my short term memory. How stupid of me. I'm not doing anything right. I'm trying to remember that some people love me and are looking for me to be with them. In my heart I know what the problem is. I forget the sanctity of our relationship. I feel ignorant and uncomfortable knowing this. In side of me I have respect that is lost. Who could find it though? I have much more fear and pride. When I write or think my ego takes over all the time and stupid feelings or lies and fairy tales come out. I became a member of rotting corpses of america's youth. I am part of the spirit of it all. I was looking at I kiss girls and saw many lesbians so I didn't comment. My dad thought I was looking at women in their underwear cause summoned someone's journal to my screen and she just happened to have something that said, ""When I get bored bad things happen""and she had pictures she took of herself in her underwear. He walked in the room a second after the pictures came on the screen. That's funny. Do you think so? Don't take offense. I am merely a soft light bulb. Not white but discolored. I thought clear and concise was a good manner to have but I'm perplexing and subtly so. You think subtlety ever got anything done right? I hate when people try to criticize others to feel comfortable about themselves. You shouldn't push anyone down to advance on them. That's wack. That line is clear apparent to my eyes. But I am not telling you anything is true and I miss the respect all the time."

"event","I have a problem. I just want to drink and drink. When I'm with other men I feel I have to be impressive by drinking myself stupid and then some. As soon as I am alone then it becomes a problem because I don't have to be impressive to myself so the liquor takes control making me sick and usually puts me in an unconscious state. Funny huh? At the folk fest the problem is enhanced because I feel very good and can really put it away. I drink until I can't stand up and even drink more after that. After letting it go for a few days I don't desire to drink by myself or with ones I am comfortable with, see me in a public setting and it becomes unbearable. I just try to dull myself down and lose the anxiety I feel. for those of you who know what it's like to drink yourself stupid you know that your mind does not function clearly and not many people like to be near you because you act stupid and obnoxious. For those of you who don't I would really like to say it hurts me more than you to not be able to communicate with you in a way you understand. So the conclusion I have come to now is that the problems I am facing and the reward or grounds that I could gain are not enough encouragement to stop. I feel good when I drink and feel like I could communicate my feelings and be a part of someone else at that time. Though no one else feels that way and by god I don't know what I am going to do."

"event","I am confused by the concept of lovemaking. What's everyone so worked up about? There is nothing to it. I think you'll find hate making is more satisfying and inevitably is what we practice anyway.
If there is a dark side of life it's got to include lovemaking because all that is is a trick to lure us into being comfortable when there is no place for comfort. It's a false interpretation and a devious thing. Don't be fooled. I'm not. Screw it all. When nobody needs you to do anything for them, you'll understand. Nobody really needs anyone do they? I say not."

"event","This stinks. I just got home form work I don't know what to do. Last night me and my father had a great ""conversation"" about how I went and bought a printer for our computer when my mother supposedly told me not to because I have a car insurance payment overdue. And what they didn't know was that I couldn't have paid it before I bought the printer. Me and my parents are not getting along and it means I've got to move out. I feel depressed because of them and the state our relationship is in and I just want to get away so we can be friendly again. I have a couple of friends that are living together not far from here that will let me live with them. It will be cheap that way and they need someone else to help with their finances. I don't really want to do that. I'm not sure that their behavior and lifestyle is good for me to be around. No I want something different than what I am now. I need to find someone that will show me a whole different lifestyle.I am seriously considering this and I know it's time for a drastic change. On that note I leave."

"event","If anybody wants me I'll be walking around out in the dark.
On the street out of the light.
I'm feeling too bad to stay within your sight.
I don't think you care.
There's some horrible thing that happened to me
and it just wants to linger there.
No one in the world tries top comprehend.
I'm not gonna set that right.

If you think I'm too complicated 
I'm just not made for you.
Your eyes, when they look inside my mind,
are pleading with me to live my life.

I know I want you but I'm feeling timid. 
Tell me do I make you nervous?
I believe there's tranquility when we are eye to eye.
It's my strength that comes up short.
I'd live without you but it seems like a nightmare,
to have to dream of desire for the rest of our lives.
If you want to find me you've to look where it's dark
and that's not very easy to do.

I'm telling you I can overcome my complications.
Just ask me to come to you.
Your eyes looking from inside me 
are pleading with me to live my life.

Don't go on me just stop a second a take a good look at what I am.
Knock me down a little so we can be eye to eye."

"event","My life is so great. No obligations but to myself. I can go where I want when I want. Me and a friend went to the great plaza at Penn's landing to try to relax. I think I succeeded in a way. We just sat and talked for awhile. My friend told me about her boyfirend and the thing they have going on. That place at night just makes you think about romance. After awhile they had some fireworks that were really cool. I've never seen the kinds they had. That was nice of them to put em on display. I was thinking how I think I wouldn't mind living in the city for awhile. I want to change everything I am doing in my life except where I work. The benefits of that are too great to give up right now. I will have the means to secure a nice place to live in December because of all the profit we are raking in now. I might need someone else to live with me though, and I'm not sure who would want to. Yeah I really want someone elses influence to change my life. Someone that I can have security with. Someone that can have it with me. Everyday I come home and think what to do, what to do. Everyday it's the same. I sort of fear the end of the workday because I feel lost after it.Philadelphia is pretty at night."

"event","Work stresses me out. I am making the same parts over and over doing so much in a day I can't stop for a second. It's a bad change of scenery from grassy field and people I like to wood, machine and machine tables. It's okay but I know that this feeling of freedom I have won't last unless I figure out something drastic to help ease the stresssss. If I can figure out what it is at the folk fest that makes me so happy I could apply it to my life. I don't think I can say, ""see ya next year"", anymore. I don't want to and so I won't. But I think my first and last entry was a bit rash and making me look like a lunatic. That was word for word something I wrote on a night I was in a motel room with my family waiting for the second day I was visiting my brother. I was thinking about more than just him. Ain't got time for this? Don't post anything unless you mean it."

"event","I guess I might as well write some stuff I wrote about a year ago as those thoughts are still buried here.
  My heart, it took a leap, off of the earth it's free of my body.
Picture the way a star sits twinkling far away. It tempts us to chase it in vain. Oh people I loved, my mind holds you tightly while harmony with my soul is lost tonight. The past cries for me and I won't return. Yet if time stood still I know I'd forever yearn to see your future. What is that foolish light I hate to see it burn so bright opening my eyes and blinding me with false interpretations. I only need to clear my sight to regain our compassionately sound relation. Could you lend me a hand? Could you give me strength? I need you to more than you may understand. I'd promise time would repay your generosity to me infinitely as long as we go hand in hand. But some have given me their hands and I stand in blatant indifference to them. I am locked down in a state of anxious suspension, lazy and depressed. I fear work because I don't enjoy my life when I have free time so I lament on the energy that was to be burned through interaction. I've become paranoid and and scared and unaware of my responsibilities as a man. I don't know what they are. Shutting down would be unfulfilling but I don't have strength to go on and pioneer for my life and my family's spirituality. I want to help someone with what others have trouble with but I've become selfish as no other. Money doesn't matter until I don't have it. My selfishness does not pertain to possession but to feeling and mental stability. I can't feel happy or involved with someone unless we are speaking of me or about something I have initiated. Then I am still not involved with that person because I am submerged in my mind, damn it."

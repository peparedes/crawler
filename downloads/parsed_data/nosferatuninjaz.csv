"event","""   I haven't much to pack besides the old weapons my uncle I haven't heard from left behind, some of my clothes, and the money my mother left for me before she passed away last winter. I can sit here at our rundown farm, feeling guilt in my heart for my mother passing away, watching our Kelbi graze on our now unkempt hills, or I can follow my heart, by becoming a monster hunter.

    This really does frighten me, like anyone else. I have only seen pictures on the walls of our village whenever I walk down there to shop for supplies for our farm. I have only heard stories of  these colossal monsters when I was a young boy, listening in on my uncle , who was a very prominent figure of my childhood, being a monster hunter and all, telling these elaborate, true stories to my father and my brother. I can't imagine how this dream of monster hunting will go for me. I have nothing left. I want nothing to do with this farm any longer. Our Kelbi have all that they need to survive, and I only have this dream to tote me around. I know it will require much strength, much courage, and much will power to venture out into these almost mythical lands, on quests that many people before me have banefully failed. I know that. And there is much I am scared to confront that I, along with the -greatest- hunters, do not know. This all scares me, but gets my blood rushing, too.

    I have trained, pushed, and at sometimes quelled my mind, body, and soul. I know where my limits end, and I hope to soon make that where my limits will only begin, and progress endlessly from there on out. All my life I have done the hard work my brother has done before becoming a vagrant hunter. I know he is great, and I know I can become great as he did, following in our uncle's footsteps.

    Knowing all that I can gather, and having what I'll need, I am heading out of this familiar place. I have only told a few villagers, and though they do not agree with my drastic and somewhat silly decision, they understand perfectly on why I dream of it, growing up around all of the lore and whatnot. I've heard of a very nice middle-class village a few days travel out of here, to the north, and I've decided to head that way. 

    I am sure though that my brother is not in that village, but I really do feel that he is on the almost completely opposite side of what they call the ""Monstrous Acreage"". I don't know how to describe this vibe I get about this intellegence. This suspicion, this hunch I've got, I'm almost certain about. I have visions about this. I see the land and its cultures in colors, and I see my brother there, as if maybe the village of his residency honored him. I have these vibes with my uncle too, and I can tell he is still alive, but nowhere in this goliath province we all live in, or even this country. But I know both of them are safe, and very well-to-do. 

    I fancy the thought of one day hunting some behemoth, and meeting my brother there. I hope he shows a liking to me, I can only hope of us becoming actual -brothers- at least once in this life.
 
    I guess I just have a longing to become something great, that people envy, and that myself even envies. I want to meet up with my uncle and my brother. I want us to start a clan. I want to have fun in my life, and this is the fun I think is right for me. With all this want I can only start to achieve this all by one step at a time, and my first step is to close this journal and head out of here.

    I don't think my journey begins now, I think it has begun before I was born, before my parents were born. Destiny has set this glorious path up for me, and I'm more than honored and excited to take it. What I want is out there, and I'm more than certain I can have it all."""

so ive sort of accepted losing my good friend Rhett
hes now way too scene for me to retrieve, too cool for anyone who isnt a thug
im not even sure if its okay to call him rhett, cuz damnit if hes not there anymore
i think one of the only ways he'd actually come back is if something totally bad happened to him, and he like....called me or something crying or some shit  to pick him up

fuck losing friends to modern society

psh, too cool for me now"

but like
my vision, and the things i see isnt relatively cool...at all
nor are the things i hear...
i just get pissed sometimes, cuz like, i cant focus when it looks like there is a hellofa lotta smoke in the air, or things are green, or unfocus'd, or, i hate it where i can see, but i cant get anything from it...
i was in PE and i just kept on hearing my name, but it'd be kinda cut up and shit
and my memory is getting shittier, like, i cant remember a week or two from school, it says i was there, but ive lost everything from a week or two from the time we started school, so i was like ""wtf we had that for homework?"" andits not likke i wasnt there, its more like it didnt happen, like someone cut it out of my life, so for the past week and a half ive been working my ass off to not fail half my classes

bio-i think im failing cuz the teachers fucking retarded, actualy, im prolly not failing cuz i just got really good grades on my tests a while ago

world history- worked my ass off in this class, passed

english 9th (yeah fuck you, its literally my moms fault)-if the teacher is still a bitch (very probable) then i have a shit grade

english 10th- should have a decent grade, we havent done like, anything in that class, really

Algebra 2- have a fail cuz first i was in geometry again, andi switched out a while after the beggining, and my algebra 2 class had started a project and did work that the teacher didnt say anything about, nor did any of my peirs...how faggot

Basket Ball ( T_T)-should be fine

but other than that i guess im fine

i really need to hangout with some friends soon"

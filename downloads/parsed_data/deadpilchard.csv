"event","Felt very, very strange today as everyone may well have guessed. Most of you probably did too... 
Read an evening standard at the earliest possible opportunity (as i was walking from Hackney to Walthamstow in pursuit of a bus... about 6 miles in 75 minutes) and was stunned by the picture of the bus (sounds like you experienced it all Mark, glad you are alright :-) ), I was however appalled by most of the reports which appeared to be little more than an attempt to dramatize an exceptionally shocking incident. Last I heard on the radio was that 37 were confirmed dead in 4 explosions across town (however both numbers are still fluctuating slightly) thoughts go out to those affected.

My own personal story as ever in these sort of times seems less than relevant, however I hope my opinion of these events is noteworthy. I will NOT be cowering away from my life as normal, and will NOT be intimidated by such behaviour. Indeed I have heard that Logic Bomb (of micromusic fame) may be playing a set tomorrow uptown, which if it is going ahead i will be attending (sorry i havent invited people but i still dont know any details).

I also went to see Jack Dee tonight btw. He was quite good, though due to circumstances only 350 of a 3500 crowd showed up, it seemed quite eriee (sp?) and i felt a little sorry for him as it was for the DVD of the tour (often meant to be the highlight), oh well what can you do eh?"

"event","Ahhh... Slipknot, like the good old days.
I though i'd do a long update today so im actually sitting in my room at the moment typing into notepad, gonna port all this using an old school floppy disc (now so obsolete that computer stores dont always offer them as standard, i mean who doesn't use CD-R's these days?).

Right firstly a slightly more in depth of the weekend. During the day me and Richard headed off to Highbury (where Arsenal play football) to see if we could find a pub that was screening the FA cup final, of course most of them were. Most of them were also full! Luckily we bumped into a (fellow?) Arsenal fan who seemed to know of a slightly more isolated pub that we could get to before the game kicked off.
In short it was excellent, the fans were loud without being destrctive, although the level of anti-spurs chants was worrying, i had to keep checking to make sure i hadn't accidentally worn a Tottenham shirt out of the house by mistake! The penalty shoot out was as tense as anything and the reaction to Jens Lehmanns save from Paul Scholes was unbelieveable.
Then the obligatory DDR (wel ITG) session, glad to say my shin has healed up quite well, its now just a case of getting my accuraycy back to the level it was prior to my injury.

I arrived at House Wandsworth far later than i expected, but i had gone via covent garden tescos to acquire some super noodles, and entered the sitting room to the joy that was the Norweigan Eurovision entry, of course i was hooked immediately, especially by the accompanying drinking game that led us through the evening (""shes changed her dress, drink!!!"") and ,me through a whole bottle of ginger wine.

The following day was one of chillage exellente, and my introduction to the world of hacky-sack, im still not sure how its possible to get your various appendages to keep the little bag of sand off the ground, and Matt and Mark's excellent demonstrations left me somewhat bewildered... The day also included listening to Kate Bush songs with Joey and Dean, finding 'my chemical romance' aren't as bad as i previously thought, watching the start of a quite harrowing film called bully (i really hope no-one actually lives like that!!), eating more super noodles and finding to my absolute disgust that Mcdonalds at Southside doesn't serve beakfast on sundays (further upset came after attempting to eat 2 apple pies). I left at 6.30pm to get the bus back, quite an uneventful 2hours really.

Today was mucho oddness, almost designed to test me methinks. Work was pretty normal except some sort of demon must have been waiting at the entrance to suck all the 'happy' from me.. What ensued was a day with no motivation on my part, a crap meeting that led no-where and seemed to disregard reports i'd worked stupidly hard on (bastards), and 2 mild (i can only call them) anxiety attacks, both of which left me terrified and at one point almost suicidal in want of escape. Gah. I can only explain them as an overwhelming feeling that something was wrong and i was powerless to do anything about it.

Thankfully i calmed down before leaving (thanks liz x) and cycled merrily(ish) home until halfway through the Argall way estate I met Samantha coming the other way! Twas nice to say hello and catch up.

Argh I've written an essay!!!, sorry for making you scroll so far to skip this entry!"

Sunday I went to Hainault to go riding with Robbie, Dean decided to come too which was pretty neat, so we went to hollow ponds (leytonstone) and rode round for a couple of hours, which was fun. by the tome i got back to hainault i was a bit tired though i guess I musta done about 30 miles in all.
Stayed round Mum's (but you all know that) and played 2 player GTA with dean. I think I'm going over to the dark side, i found it quite fun (ARRGGHH!!!!).

Went to walthamstow library today to get a Maths textbook, i think of all the years that i didnt use textbooks and had to, now i dont and am quite enjoying it!!!
Had some good MSN's too, which was nice seeing as ive not spoken to some in a week or so

There is more to this than pure frugility (is that a real word?), as i think that i've got to learn that you dont need to spend to have a good time. It also will give me a chance to flex my cerebral metal for a bit, I want to explore my creative side (and even have an idea for a book that i quite like) and also want to learn things, which is why ive registered with the local library and borrowed three books. One on calculus, one on astrophysics and one on french. I wonder if ill get far enough into them to learn anything.
I'm gonna start looking into free entertainment too... im happy to spend a t-card but apart from that i hope to spend very little indeed. Anyone else with ideas give me a bell."

Then went to play DDR on a suspiciously laggy Extreme machine (I think they tried to upgrade a not quite compatible mix), which was alright, at least Maxx Unlimited was piece of piss.
Went for a drink with Rich, Law and Mike afterwards, which was a good laugh, drank a nice (and cheap), if weak cocktail called a TVR.

Thursday night was blammo excellente (its not copyright do feel free to use it yourselves) first with a sucessful piece of DDRing (i now own 5 leader boards, bet that changes today...) followed by a night of grand music and merry dancing.

Problem being it was so fun i had to go to bed at 8pm yesterday to get over it (damn my silly work obligation).

Back on DDR... Those of you i havent spoken to wont know that there is an ITG tournament next saturday. I dont plan to win but i plan to enter nonetheless. Anyone interested in a day up the arcades can therefore expect me at the troc from 12pm on 30th April.

My busy weekend has become a disorganised one... i was meant to be phoning people while i was asleep last night, im sure it will all be ok."

I was playing really well anyways but selected 'Mythology' quite a hard 10 with a long quarter beat stretch at the end (sorry if you are lost now). As I approached this nightmare stretch, the arrows first seemed to slow down, then acres of space appeared between each one, then finally they seemed to raise a few inches off of the screen as it was time to hit them!!!!

"event","I'm starting to hate the fact that this is a forum of badness for me, but then maybe im just concentrating on the wrong bits...

Today was (mildly) a bit odd. Work was haphazard at best, with me pulling every work avoidance trick in the book, then feeling guilty about it so apparently doing it a bit more. There was one fairly hideous half hour though where it just felt like the world was closing in on me, I just wanted to curl up into a ball and fade away. Not die necessarily just have a hiatus from life.

Met mum and dean uptown (if she doesnt update here herself ill be shocked to the core!!), and had a cool time. Had a real problem though holding on to the achievement i gleaned from my ITG freestyle attempts, or the fact i passed Utopia (another 11 making 3 so far (whats the point of shouting my successes if i dont feel successful?!)). I think im beginning to feel like its too shallow to take any credit for, although that may just be because im at the point where id have to accept credit (dammit im confused now).

Decided a couple of things on the way back. Firstly i was going to be nice to random people (and i wasn't even thinking about Danny Wallace) starting now (people looking for how that turned out skip to next paragraph). The other was a sort of desire, that is safety. I really want to be able to get home and have someone put their arms around me, and i can just stay there. I wish for nothing more than the safety of companionship, that may be even more shallow but it just feels too hard to support myself at the minute. This isn't a relationship per se either, just someone to feel comfortable with.

Ah well, with everyone thinking im shallow, we can go on to my good deeds. Nothing that special, indeed not even really deeds. One lady opposite me seemed to be nodding off, so i offered to wake her at her stop should she require. She seemed confused, (i'd simply asked where she was getting off, must've seemed a bit sus in hindsight) but on explaining she actually seemed quite pleased by the offer despite declining as like me she departed at the trains terminus. 
I also wished the Woman sitting next-but-one to me luck on her impending driving test (she was reading a theory test revision guide) and she too took it very well. I think its just gonna be women and old people for now, just because i think men get very suspicious of any offers of help in London. Unless i see a case where specific help is required.

Doesnt seem too pessimistic now does it? as always ill keep you all posted. 

BTW doesnt the indifferent smiley seem too content? i assure you its a different kind that means more to me."

"event","Feeling almost as bad as i ever have if im honest. This is a real shame as ive just remembered that Saturday was a really cool day. I really wish the good times stuck but they just wash away. Imagine if you will a velcro pad. I am that pad, all good feelings are rocks and all bad feelings are scatch balls (early 90's reference anyone?). So give me a good day with a bad minute and all you get is a bad day.

This isnt to depress anyone, just trying to slightly explain my absurd fluctuations in mood that some of you may experience from me. Im sometimes happy, exceptionally happy. It must seem like nothing can bring me down, but somehow it does. I quote two parties in the early part of the year. Jo and Law's birthdays both started well and Im sure i seemed to be loving it, indeed i was. One knock however, not necessarily caused by anyone just one that exists, is enough for me to quit with any sort of joy. 

I dont know why,  i wish it wasnt the way but alas it is. One thing is however, i am pursuing help. It does appear to be a psychological disorder of some kind, and after some time putting it off, im going to get anti-depressants from the pharmacy (not in some insane heist, they are perscribed) and im really gonna try. Until i see some sort of therapist though, im not sure what trying is. I just hope that all of you keep your patience with me long enough to see me when i feel like its ok to be me.

Also a little apology to all that ive been 'off' with at some point for about the last year/18 months. It may have been a genuine gripe at the time, but im sure however it was i acted, it was entirely disproportionate. 

Thanks to everyone thats there for me, however it seems to come across, i appreciate it now, and will probably appreciate it a lot more at some point in the (hopefully) not too distant future. Although my overriding mood is depressed, there is a hint of optimism bourne of this post so take that in too."

Well for a moderate update, the aforementioned event at Judes was alright. Towards the end (especially when just Charlie and partner (Darryl or Darren, I didn't ask for accuracy, I never do...) I just didn't feel, well wanted i guess... Almost like i was exhausting oxygen for the others. I had however had a fabulous time during the day just chilling at Mums, just playing cards etc.

Today was cool too, if not slightly forced at times. It was very nice talking to Maggie and Roger at Jo's, as it always is, and it was about the sixth time I said goodbye to Jo before she returned to Wandsworth. Was also cool playing cards at the Murcutt's. See I had a good time today but cant help but feel slightly weird about the whole affair.

Without tainting events, i guess I feel slightly disheartened that the first real event at the flat has occurred without me. Even though I knew it must happen. Guess I just didn't really think about it so once more wasn't really sure how to deal with it.

Went to Mike's in the evening and got some talking done, which helped to clarify things in some small way. I guess thats all part of life though, the good moods cannot last forever, just have to enjoy them while they last."

Work was excellent, lots of people making sure i was ok etc. lots enquiring as to why i was away so long. Everyone was very nice and a few people that i wasn't even sure if they noticed me before were calling me over to make sure i was alright and catch up.

The bike proved to be a monster to ride. I found myself putting my foot down in far too many places as the breaks just werent cutting it. That and i got a little lost getting to Leytonstone in the afternoon so it took me about 10 minutes longer than it should have.

I was in Leytonstone to see Mr K and it had the wonderful effect of making me feel like i was 16 again... From eating Pizza on Demand, Chatting to the Knights as a whole and meeting Chris J near Tescos. Like I've never been away...

First, Liz's condition. 
On Monday night (about 6pm) she had an ultrasound scan, which showed no obstructions in the bile ducts (those studying biology can tell me the real name), this meant that whatever obstruction caused the condition, it's not there anymore.

Today on meeting the consultant, Liz was told that they (all going well) will operate on her on Tuesday to remove the Gall bladder (the little bastard that caused all this). As a result she will be staying in for observation till Friday, then put on weekend release till Monday. All this means that shes still in some pain (though nowhere near as bad) and it should all soon be over.

Thank you all for your kind words, they mean a lot to both of us. Thankfully today has been a lot easier, Liz calling me early on to put my mind at rest, so i could get on with just doing the normal old thing. Still feel a bit like a yo - yo right now but im sure that will improve. Also with Liz being better (ish) but still in hospital, i can stay here with a lighter heart. 

Will obviously keep you all posted. Oh and im sometimes on MSN  edicius81@hotmail.com, you may add me if you so wish, (makes it so much easier than hunting all your adresses down).

"event","erm... help.
This was intended to be a bit of a foray into my feelings, but then i realised that other people read it and didn't feel to... Then i Realised that the fact other people read it is the reason im not writing on paper... See sad as it sounds (and vividly self important), i like getting a response from my feelings, otherwise im just not sure what they mean. anyway if it gets too much write ""oh yes i see what you mean"" as a comment now. That will keep us both satisfied, done it yet? good.

For those of you that are still here, read the most recent post from Lizbag, I know it's not from 'her' exactly but you know...

Right so now i'm going back in time one week, as it was almost that to the minute that we decided to stop being ""Waine and Liz"", and take up being ""Waine"" and ""Liz"". I'm not sure that any decision i've made thus far as played as hard on my mind as that. Liz is being her usual strong self, any sign of outward weakness wouldn't do, although I can see it's as hard for her as it is for me. As for me, I've been an emotional state, useless at hiding my true feelings without being an arse, up until Friday morning I'd either been crying or an arse at any one point. There were the high points though... Tuesday night was glorious, so good that i ruined it when we got in, was horrible on wednesday and quite nice on Thursday, me having just been round Mike's for a more than useful chat, however on thursday night Liz got a text that however misinterpreted, meant that someone close had been thoughtless (sorry i'm so vague but it's more feelings than events im trying to explore). 

I went crazy, smashed things, shouted a lot and mainly threw up all the emotion i'd been harbouring since Monday. Sort of ""i wish we could be together,"" ""Why the hell can't we be together,"" and ""now i've thought about it being single is probably a good idea"" had been going round on a carousel and i couldn't take any more confusion.

Friday and Saturday were brilliant cause I started to feel close to Liz without the need to be with her (after all that Yo-Yo ing it was either that or start my career as a quivering wreck sooner than planned). and also arranged between us and Samantha that i would stay round there while she was in Scotland, giving us the opportunity to be realy alone for a few days in order to adjust.

Meanwhile i'd been coming to the conclusion that my job was paying me less than i needed to do more than i wanted and am still intending on handing in my notice on Tuesday.

The events of today though have left me lost again, I know that being single is right for both of us, but seeing Liz in hospital today, all i wanted to do was make her happy, and not by being her flatmate. Thing is i'll probably be OK after sleep, but at the moment so much is going on in my little mind i feel ready to burst. if anyone wants to be showered in brains, now would be a good time to stand close.

As I've said, I'll keep you posted on Liz's condition when i know more, but due to the recent events i'll be at the normal place this week for those of you who may wish to contact me.
now i must go, as my bicycle is beginning to beckon..."

Well Liz is getting ready for dinner for my dad's birthday. I of course am waiting till it's far too late for me to do all the things i'd like to before it's time to leave. 
It's kinda cool to make one entry and then find that everyone but everyone considers you a friend, hope you like the name and dont find it too environmentally offensive, I assure you the Pilchard died of natural poisoning from toxins spewed by a Barnsley factory.

In order to finish on a completely wasted note (like the ones previous i guess), go and see saw. not because its grand but because i think its gonna split the audience. Of course that is the real point of going to the cinema, to have an opinion.

Bye!!!!"

"event","not much happened today so ill tell what i would have liked to have happened.
At 9am i awoke to find the cat eating a wasp, glad to have avoided any potential sting based damage i danced my way to the lounge to the tune of 'stairway to heaven' my very own dance remix. Having reached the lounge i fell asleep on the sofa until about 5 mins ago. so there you are hope you like my live journal, this will be one of few entries im sure.

goodbye."

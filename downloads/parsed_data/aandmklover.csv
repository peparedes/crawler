I can not beleive the time has almost come.  It seems like yesterday i was the new second grader at Huron Elm.  I had so much fun back then trying to act older than i was.  This is the time when i was so lucky to get the bestest friend in the world.  I may not talk to her every day, we may not go to dances together but i know she'll always be there.  Our homes are less than a jog away and yet i dont see this girl for months.  She knows the right things to say at the perfect times and i will never give the memories up.  You know who you are.  Riding bikes with Noxima on, climbing many trees, playing music and making stupid dances, all the arguements, all the tears, most of all the smiles, the firsts, like boyfriends, peroids, jobs, kisses (and more). you were never an obligation but only a pleasure, Because i love you.  You are a true best friend and i will be talking to you soon.  I love you!


i have many more i want to talk about but the mall comes first!!

So when manny dosent want to get hurt with spinner this season, it really mean more.  I guess thats why she got the slut name too.  Wow i'm board!



""There's a big gymnastics meet at Degrassi, and Manny's going to lead the team to gold! But when she starts to feel sick, she fears that her queasy stomach might be more than the flu or even a case of bad nerves. And she's suddenly not sure she and Craig used protection when they had sex. Not knowing where to turn (it's sure not going to be her strict mom), Manny turns to Emma's mom Spike, the one person she knows who's been in her shoes. When Manny's worst fears are realized, she finds support from Spike, Emma and even Craig, who takes the news surprisingly well. Toby's feeling more and more shut out of JT's new world of hanging with the cool kids, especially when Jimmy invites JT to DJ Mad Bullets concert. So Toby comes up with a plan to win Jimmy over: he'll hack into the school's computer system and alter Jimmy's math grade. After all, if there's one thing a nerd like Toby knows, it's computers! So what can go wrong?

i didnt go to first hour because Ryan ashly and i went to get yummy food.  (that was a good part of my day) Then we got to school and i had to go threw 5 dumb ass hours of boring shit.  Then i came home and took a nap the really sucked, waking up to phone and REALLY not wanting to go to work.  I called my cousin to see if she tought iwas bad that i didnt want to go to work and iwas going to call them and quit that min.  Well she said i  could and it was no big deal. So then i called my dad to tell him i was going to quit.  Well he gave me the gilt trip of ""I will think differntly of you if you dont give your 2 weeks""  so then me crying, for the 500th time in 3 days i go to work, then i couldnt get outta my drive way because my dads truck was in my way, so i drove on the grass.  5 hours of work later and i'm still not even close to being done to leave, so i worked for 6 hours today.  I got home to find out the phone was off the hook for over and hour and my brother was not even paying any attenetion to the dog he so muchley loves.

You and your boyfriend have the rest of your fucking lives to stare into each others eyes completely love struck. go without him for one day. i promise, it wont kill you.""     

^^^^This was and Anonymous quote by a person unknown^^^^



to this person i have a few things to say.  One if you are one of my close friends then why not talk to me to my face, two i have tryed to speak to all of you many times about what you guys want to do for spring break and the only response i've gotten is ""We want to go to Cananda"".  I want to go to Cananda, i want to go someplace hott and fun.  Also almost all fo you have said eather you dont have money or you cant go.  If thats not trying i dont know what is.  I'm the only one whos even tried to think of somthing and i'm the one that gets stepped on.  Also I'm not sorry that i want to do something with Ryan.  Hes the only person whos even sounded a  little intested in doing anything with me for spring break.  


If this is a person whos not a close friend, Stay out... this has nothing to do with you and what makes you think you have any say in my life.  If you dont have enough balls to tell me to my face... then i dont care about what you ahve to say anyways...









Other than that lifes been good... lets see, i Finished my PHoto portfolio finally... its done.... NO MORE SHIT!!!! Whooo hooooo... i'm happy for that one. 



We only have one full week left in this semester, its weird, come on seinors were almost done.  that makes me so happy, The day we graduate i garentee i cry like a  baby!  HAHAHAHA



Its almost 8 on a friday night and i'm doing nothing, how lame!???!!!
            I guess i'll be busy soon

I can not wait to get her, she is going to be kick ass.  he loves me i can already tell.  Boys are dumb.  cousins rock my worls.  (ash and Dee dee)  I miss my friends.  I was hopeing Michelle would come over last night but she didnt, i bet i know what she did instead.  (bad girl)  Halloween day is going to be ok, it would be better if i could hang with ry tho.  my daddy baught me and ry pumpkins so we did that friday night.  It made me happy that we did it together this year instead of him doing it with other people.  he liked his cool picture.  so did i.  i'm going to get my hair cut short.  i need change since someone i love wont change for me, i'll change my self for me.  

I got a job.  It pays good and that makes ryan mad.  Its only a winter job tho... so my jan i have to start looking again.  its good for now. B&BW and WCB!!  



I want to go to florida for spring break.  I wish my good friends would go with me too.  Michelle, Jenny, Tricia, Beth, Meggi, Ryan.. are all invited, if you  would like to go let me know, the more people we have the less the rooms would be.  I will do all the real planning if you let me know.

Theres nothing pure, wonderful and amaizing about being with a person so long that you fight about the littlest things... just because you can...
theres nothing special about being ""with"" a person one night, then the next day its like it never happend because it happens so often...
theres nothing great about wondering if the person is thinking about you as much as you think about them, when its all you do.. day in, and day out.  
how does it get so un-inportant... how does love seem like it fades... 
most inportantly... how can i love you more and more every day and everyting above dosnet matter...
all that matters is I LOVE YOU
and YOU LOVE ME!"

The lady gave me an interview time on the spot. today at 2:30 But that dosent mean anything because she called today at noon to tell me htat we have to re-schedule because they are having a huge sale today and theres something going on in the middle of the malll.

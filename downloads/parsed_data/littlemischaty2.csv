"event","Sorry, I couldn't write for a while... I was grounded from AOL. 

Now, some of you know that I like to write poetry. I can only write when I feel strongly about something. So I have some poems that I would like to read, if you please! lol. So hear they are.... FYI..(most of you have already read the first 2) It's a long entry this time..so bare with me.

They Can't Get Inside

Come to me, come away with me
where they can't find us,
where we will be together in a place all our own.

To a place where they can't make me stop loving you,
no one to judge
no one to tease
just you and me, you and me

But their is no such place,

It's all in my mind, I'm glad that no one out there can get inside.

The people out there just live in doubt, but don't worry my love, I will figure it out.

We will both be together, some way and some how....

If you come to me,
To a place where they can't make me stop loving you

Where it's just you and me, you and me...you and me.

Thank you
Love Always,
Rachel

Someone

I know someone, someone special

I love the way he laughs
I love the why he crys
I love the way he says my name, when he whispers ""I Love You"" when no one else is nearby.

I know someone...
 
I know him like this
He's someone special
I tell in his kiss

To me he's special
To me he's everything

I know someone, someone special.

Thank you
Love Always, 
Rachel

Broken

Bended, broken, on the floor
When I heard you say those words and nothing more.

How could you------
Why would you------

Wont to hurt me..
Wont to leave me..

You did something wrong and tryed to hide it

I found out...You knew I would

You left me, mt heart, bended, broken on the floor
When you said those words -- THOSE WORDS -- and nothing more.

I felt empty and alone... with my heart... the one that I had given all to you... broken on the floor.

Thank you
Love Always,
Rachel

FYI...This poem is a sonnet. A sonnet is a poem that only has 14 lines and 10 syllables in each line. 12 of the lines have to do with generally one thing, and the last 2, finnish up your feelings.

Lost Love

I love you with all of my heart and soul.
Taking my breath away, making me smile.
I float on air every time you are near.
You make my heart flutter and my soul jump.

You feel the same, or thats what you say.
I am sure that you do and did, you changed.
Why why, you made me cry and ran from me. 
You ran to another and asked for her.

Breathing you, dreaming you, being part of you.
Forever until eternity, you.
You are and always will be part of me.
You, in my heart and mind for all of time.

Our love will only die if you let it.
So live and drink it up before it's gone.

Thank you
Love Always,
Rachel

Sorry about that Kevin, Thank you Kevin- for just being Kevin and trying to talk to Will. lol.

I feel anxious, anything but my usual happy-full of life self.  

On another note.... Will--This not talking to each other thing is not working. (Tell me if you agree.) I don't hate you, I did when I wrote it, but thats a different story. You hurt me and I don't understand what made you cheat on me with one of my friends. Would you care to explain that to me? I guess your mom called my mom at work and they talked about some stuff that I won't post hear because I still respect you. The truth is, we were each others best friends. We laughed together, cryed together, shared our inner most feeling together,(i'm crying now) our poetry together, and sooo much more. We had a bond that seemed unbreakable to everyone.(at least i thought so) I thought that you would just always be there for me, to protect me and to hold me when I cryed. I just never thought that this would happen- since up to the very last day you told me that you loved me. I guess its nice to know that you ""NEVER"" had fun with me, and that you would pay 10 bucks for someone to throw a basketball at my head. Good times, we've had better. Well now... This seems like this is our only of communicating, so I hope you read it and write back.

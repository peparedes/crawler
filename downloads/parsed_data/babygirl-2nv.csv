"event","Wow I haven't properly updated in ages. Lik Sharne I may do this in point form because it seems so much easier :-)

01- Bulldogs have lost many many games in a row and therefore Kate is not happy. Oh well, I can only hope they will pick up their form again soon and start to play better for my sanity and the sanity of all the fans and for the team.
02- As most of you should know I now work at Penrith Pilates and my job involves looking after two kids James and Ellie. Ellie is six and so adorable. Sometimes I hate the job but today made me smile. She told me she had a secret to tell and whispered in my ear ""I'm glad your our babysitter Kate"" and when I made dinner she goes ""thank you for a lovely meal Kate."" I can't wait to have kids.
03- Started my new program at the gym today. Nigel took me for it and I did a 5km bike ride and 2km row to start off with. I'm feeling so much better lately because of my old program/new program and my Pilates. Can't wait to get back into basketball and I think I'm starting netball too. So should be good.
04- finally got my new bed put in today. Waahoo
05- I can't believe I don't have much to write. Lol. After I haven't updated for so long.
Meh

It's something I must live with everyday

I wish that I could take it all away

It's 5:55pm. I've been outta bed for about 20 minutes and had been in bed since I got home from Brooks at about 8:00am this morning.
Last night was great. From what I remember. I rocked up to Brook's at about 7. Cameron and I then went to Maccas to see Leanne cos it was her last shift there and then got back to Brook's at about 8. Thats when I started drinking. My four cruisers and my bottle of vodka. Haha. My bottle of vodka is empty and the cruisers are gone. Nice.
There were heaps of people there which was pretty awesome. At about 1, Pete, Ryan and I went to Embassy Pete certain I would get in off his sister's I.D. Which I did. Hehe. Embassy was pretty cool. We saw Pam there and I saw Sonja and I haven't seen Sonja in ages... Had another vodka and orange there which I probably shouldn't have. Oh well. We danced all morning till everyone got kicked out at 4am. Ryan dropped me back at Brook's and I crashed there before coming home this morning. Went to bed when I got home. Got up at about 11 to throw up. Lol. and then back to bed for me.
Was gonna go to the Panthers game but meh, I couldn't be bothered.

Damn Bulldogs lost. Meh oh well it's only round 2."

The darkness helps until the whiskey wears away,
And it's then I realize the conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

When we could only need each other, we'd breathe together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
When we were the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'd breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another,
'cause we were the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
""lies will lock you up with truth the only key.""
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place would soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll breathe together,
Our hands will not be taught to need another's,
When we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another...

I step outside my mind's eye's for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring onto yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering who we were...

<b> <i> so sorry </i> </b>
For everytime you had to go asleep alone.
For everytime I tried to rush you off the phone.
For everytime I said something to make you cry.
Now that all is said and done, I can't deny.


I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,
And I'm sorry, the best laid plans sometimes fall through,
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.


For everytime I lied right to your face,
And you knew it.
For all the wasted time that we cannot replace.
For everytime that a discussion turned into an argument, we'd fight.
Hey, how I wish that I could have it back tonight.


I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,
And I'm sorry, the best laid plans sometimes fall through,
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.


To try and count your tears, would be like standing in the rain.
The weather's been bad, for that I'll gladly take the blame.
Now our two separate lives will never ever be the same,
But I hope that you can forgive someday.


I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,

<b> <i> someday, someway, somehow </i> </b>
I try to pull myself together,
One lie, tore us apart.
We left so many words unspoken.
You walked away with my heart,
And I cried, I cried.
Heaven knows how much I cried.
Could you find the strength within you,
To give me one more try.


If I called you, would you believe what I had to say,
And if I saw you, would you, turn and run away.
If I had my way girl, you'd be with me right now.
Someday, someway, somehow.
Someday, someway, somehow.


I thought that I could go on without you.
Guess what? I was so wrong,
And I realized how much I really love you,
And it's been far too long.
I know you cried, I know you cried.
Heaven knows how much you cried.
But can you find the strength within you,
To give me one more try.


If I called you, would you believe what I had to say,
And if I saw you, would you, turn and run away.
If I had my way girl, you'd be with me right now.
Someday, someway, somehow.
Someday, someway, somehow.


So come on, don't I get my one mistake.
Let's forget about yesterday for tomorrow,
I know we've found what's at the end of the rainbow,
And it's meant to be, it's meant to be,


If I called you, would you believe what I had to say,
And if I saw you, would you, turn and run away.
If I had my way girl, you'd be with me right now.
Someday, someway, somehow.
Someday, someway, somehow.


Someday, someway, somehow.

Two very long days of 8-5 thats why it sucked. We made some new friends though with some girls. Suzi, Sabrina and Vanessa. They seemed really nice.
I was so proud when we were doin CRP and EAR and the guy asked if anyone knew what ECC was. No one said anything so I answered with ""External Cardiac Compression"" and everyone was like ""woah how did u know that"" even the smart adults didnt know that... thats what u get from PE :-) lol.
Sat night wen to Jarod's party for a bit. Good times all round. Took Marty, Scott, Cam and Colleen with me cos then we were gonna go to Marty's. Marty got some weed off one of the guys and then we headed up the mountains to Marty. Left there about 12:30 cos I kept falling asleep. Had a massiave week last week with work so I was buggered.
Yesterday first aid cert. again and then I done nothing at night and went to be really early.
Working this arvo which should be alright.
Lost basketball on Friday which sucks. We were soooo close.

You're still the only one that feels like home.

I let you go but you're still the only one

Eyebrow wax yesterday, love em. Just makes me feel so much better. Afterwards my parents left for their little weekend away thingy. I was gonna have some people over last night but my bro went skitz so I didnt.This after Brook and I went and bought our alcohol and some food stuffs for the evening. Oh well.
So instead of that we went to the movies. We includes myself, Colleen, Mel, Marty, Cameron and Scott. We saw ""Constantine"" which was really stupid and weird and I didnt wanna see it but oh well. 
After that Marty, Cam and I went to Marty's house. Picked up some 'stuff' and headed back down the mountain. We stopped in at maccas to say hi to Troy who was on close. While at maccas Daniel rung Marty *Marty's sis is going out with Daniel's brother so they are pretty good mates* and was being all weird. He then came and saw us at maccas and was an emotional wreck (i dont know why) and we think he must've taking something. He said he wanted to talk to Marty and didnt even end up saying anything to them and then drove off. We're getting worried bout him cos he is always like that lately. *sigh*
We then drove back to my house, picked up my alco and some stuff, left the car there, and started walking back to Cameron's, drinking on the way. Ha Ha aren't we bums. Walking through the streets of Emu Plains at 11pm drinking. Was fun though. Got to Cameron's and sat out the back drinking and talking. It was good. A nice little catch up. Got home about 3am and I got out of bed at about 12:30. Works well for me!!
Tomorrow I start work at 7am :-( that sucks ass."

"event","i'm never gonna be good enough for you...

i wonder how and why people do the things they do. how they can forget bout everything so quickly? how they can throw away so much fun and happiness and &hearts;love&hearts; just like that *snaps fingers*
how can one day you love someone with all your heart? how can one day you say you never wanna leave this person and you are so scared to leave them? how can one day you say you wanna spend the rest of your life with one person and the next day... forget bout everything and move on...
how can it be so easy?

how can people not believe in forgiveness and second chances? everyone fucks up. everyone does. even those of us who are 'perfect' but love should make u be able to forgive them...
how can all this happen?? ill never understand...

everything is screwed atm. i just dunno about anything anymore. everything used to be so much easier... it really did...."

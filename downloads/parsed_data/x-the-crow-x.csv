"event","Dear, Die-ary
I started,motionless before the mirror. As always, i stayed until im convinced that there is no glass, nothing separating me from the room i see on the other  side.
I imagine that everything is  different. over there better.  there are people. In that world, who i would like.
But,like always. my hand hits the glass. I know that if id only waited just one more second...shit Im gonna go kill a party clown."

"event","Some nights ago me and a guy friend that works at the book store,went to some view point and  we  talked about how beautiful it was looking down at the city. then it got weird he asked if i wanted to go back to my place...so i said yes..anyways  when we  were at  my house me and him sat down and  he told me he really enjoyed tonight then he  asked me what would i have done if he  hadnt asked me to go  to the view  point i told him that i would have been  happy just to go to the  book store and see him there..i always like  doing that...then he told me he liked me...aahhh, yea it got  strange...but he kinda made me happy...then he said ""good then lets both me happy""...HE MADE A  MOVE ON ME! i got really nerves  and got  up and ran to my room  were mr.fuck & psychodoughboy was mr.fuck told  me that i should go back and be happy but  then psycho told me that mr.fuck was lieing  that there  was no love and  no happyness for me...god damn  that fucken psychodoughboy, i told him to shut up,cause i was in no mood for a depression! then mr.fuck told me to not let  the beautiful moon set..to capture it,freez it forever in time with  never the memory of losing  it to  another day. he had a point....then derek(guy from book store) came in and  asked me what i was doing, so i grabed both of my nifes  and told him i was immortalizing the  moment...he looked scared  but  he didnt see it, i was  happy  i couldnt let him go we  had begun something lovely,and as with  all things,  that start,it  inevitably,ends! the beginning is  always  so fine..i cant recall a bad  memory for any  of the others they  were  all cute all of them, and now him. he screamed  at me and  told me to stop joking around. i told him to please be silent before he says something to spoil the mood. when i atacked him he punched me and threw me  on the ground. he ran out of my house, i think  i was laying on the ground bleeding for  about 1hour."

How is it he was so cute and so fucken ugly inside!? it wouldnt of take much to make his outside look like his insides!!! heh!! i could just chop his brain out! it doesnt deserve such a nice body!!!! ....but i wont!  im better then that. his shit  is hidden in good looks, but i can smell it! im not so nice to look at, but inside im...im...uh......Today i learned that on the inside im pretty fuckin ugly."

"event","Such amusing fiction, these stories they tell. it always comes  to this. if they really had a desire to live they would'v been   more aware of how easy it is to die. would've chosen their actions more wisely. in these moments you can tell they're not regreting having hurting you.
The regret doing it to your face...they get so loud. they make so much noise. I try to wait until im out of the room before i start laughing..a blur..of sweating..screaming...crying...human...drama. But every once in awhile they say things that sound like words. they make me think about what im doing. The noises make me uncomfortiable. so uncomfortiable that sometimes i wonder...why i just dont get myself a pair of earplugs."

"event","Its so difficult to truly care about so many things without first knowing the answers to some of the most fundamental, mind ravaging questions! how can one possibly respect the existence of something, people in this case when that something seems to defy respect? they do such  trivial things and find amusement even up to""so called"" maturity in the incessant mistreatment of their own kind.
But keep in mind; its possible that im quit horrendously insane. thats the fuck of it you know, the old thing about the crazy person who never knows they're crazy. it could just be an imperceptible shiftimg of accepted reality. its all really interesting. hmm i just saw someone comit suicid..g2g drain some blood for the walls."

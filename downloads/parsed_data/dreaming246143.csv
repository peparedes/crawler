"event","so updates from me seem to be gettin further and further apart
the baby is doing great
he might be home in a few weeks depeneding if he can get the
eating thing down... he can eat by himself
but it takes so much out of him that it brings
his heart rate down cuz he doesnt know how to 
eat and breath at the same time so he gets nervous
so once he gets the whole eating and breathing thing
down he can go home!! im excited

lets see what else..
report cards... not so great but w/e
my curfew is now 1 hahahaha im stoked
i wasnt expecting that at all
ummm last nite was good
and yeaa thats about it
idk updating is just not a fun thing to do
but this update is pretty long for me
so i think you should comment

bAbY RoCk oN77: yea i tried the whole between the toes thing cuz u know people cant see it but that hurt more
heatherlyn13: yea really...snorting is just so much easier..yea sure so it makes me sneeze which is a bitch, but once its in my system i dont give a damn
bAbY RoCk oN77: its so true... i wish it wold work the same orally cuz u know everything oral is better
heatherlyn13: definately...whenever your mouth is full, you know that you basically rock at life
bAbY RoCk oN77: and our lives rock
heatherlyn13: psh yea. you know how we do
bAbY RoCk oN77: up in the villes from b-m
heatherlyn13: ya dude...gangsta what?!?
bAbY RoCk oN77: yea shortie u know how we roll
heatherlyn13: fo sho in cherri the trampp 
bAbY RoCk oN77: cherri the tramp is only the tramp cuz of the people she drives
bAbY RoCk oN77: and she drives them hard
heatherlyn13: oh that she does...she can do it fast..or do it slow
heatherlyn13: and in every conditio
heatherlyn13: n
bAbY RoCk oN77: which ever way u prefer
bAbY RoCk oN77: thats y we love cherri
heatherlyn13: for sure...for that and for the fact that she has one hawt stick
bAbY RoCk oN77: that stick is way hawt... u know how to shift it well... as would anyone else in cherri
bAbY RoCk oN77: we just get better with practice
heatherlyn13: yea..i own the stick. up, down, all around, any gear, fast, slow, i know how to work it,
bAbY RoCk oN77: i would like to get my own two hands on that stick
heatherlyn13: that stick is quite hawt..it likes to get in different positions depending on different speeds
bAbY RoCk oN77: its nice to be in control with the stick in ur hand
heatherlyn13: it is very nice. you control every movement to the way you want it
bAbY RoCk oN77: i mean whenever theres a stick in ur hand u know u rule cuz every movement could be pleasurable or just well... painful
heatherlyn13: exactly and either way you win. you have the power. you can get anything you want.
bAbY RoCk oN77: you can get anything u want and go anywhere u want... oh power is great
bAbY RoCk oN77: a little rub of the stick and its like a genie in a bottle.. poof anything u want... its urs
heatherlyn13: fo sho. you get the pleasure. you give to get and if you dont get then you take away
bAbY RoCk oN77: fo real... win win my friend win win
heatherlyn13: definately..
heatherlyn13: gotta love the stick..and with the stick, you can have love without the glove but sometimes your better off to wear them,...you never know
bAbY RoCk oN77: yea u never know... u gotta always be safe... and in ur car im sure we could a glove... cherri is prepared like that
bAbY RoCk oN77: *we could find a glove
heatherlyn13: all that junk in her trunk..theres gotta be some
bAbY RoCk oN77: damn straight
bAbY RoCk oN77: cherri may be a tramp but shes a safe tramp

"event","I'm afraid it's been too long to try to find the reasons why
I let my world close in around a smaller patch of fading sky
But now I've grown beyond the walls to where I've never been
And it's still winter in my wonderland 
I'm waiting for the world to fall
I'm waiting for the scene to change 
I'm waiting when the colors come
I'm waiting to let my world come undone
I close my eyes and try to see the world unbroken underneath
The farther off and already it just might make the life I lead
A little more than make-believe when all my skies are painted blue
And the clouds don't ever change the shape of who I am to You"

Born on the 7th day of month gives you a tendency to be something of a perfectionist and makes you more individualistic in many ways. 

Your mind is good at deep mental analysis and complicated reasoning. 

You are very psychic and sensitive, and you should usually follow your hunches. 



You may not take orders too well, so you may want to work alone or in a situation where you can be the boss. 

This birthday gives a tendency to be somewhat self-centered and a little stubborn.</td>

"event","So many contradictions in my life.  I want to do everything and excel at everything!  But there is not enough time to do so.  And it's hard to choose.  Whenever I'm at a certain place/thing or with certain people, I want to be doing <i>that</i>.  Ahhh.  But it's okay.  I have focused my efforts more...yet I still am conflicted between many things.  But I guess I just have to do what works and is right for me?  For example, I feel like I ""should"" have international research experience, but if there is nothing that I can think of, then I probably shouldn't try to force a research project or whatever.

Anyhoo, things are good in general.  This semester is already better than last semester.  I'm much happier and ""lighter"" this semester."

Sooo exciting!  I'm really happy.  I think that this will be good for me, help me be more outgoing and a better public speaker.  And I can help give back to Tufts in a different way now."

In other news, I had an awesome weekend visiting Cara at UVM.  I loved Burlington.  It was the perfect vacation and just what I needed.  I can only think about one minor flaw of the whole weekend, which is something that I just have to work out, and I must say only one flaw is amazing for a whole weekend."

"event","So I keep reminding myself that maybe all of these difficult/hard experiences are making me stronger and more prepared and more experienced.  But I don't think that's necessarily true.  Oh man, so many uncomfortable situations.  Maybe in the long run these experiences will help me better know who I am.  But right now they're chipping away at me and who I thought I was and what I want to be as they question and challenge what I've thought and believed.  But maybe in the end I'll actually figure out who/how I am and who/how I want to be and I'll be able to proudly, confidently stand up and show that and BE that way.  And not be scared or shy to do so.  To just be me and be comfortable and happy with that."

And why is it is so effing hard for me to show a guy that I like him.  Why am I so afraid to express/show my emotions.  Is rejection really that hurtful and scary that I can't put myself out on the line."

"event","I need to stop reading other people's xangas.  No good can come of that.

Reading other people's online journals/diaries/blogs/whatever you want to call them is like being able to read their minds.  But it's not quite the same.  In fact, it's worse because you can only know part of what they're thinking because you only know what they choose to write.

So, to reiterate, there are some xangas that I shouldn't read because they make me stress out and feel insecure.

"event","Lots to update, sorry about the lack thereof.  But spring break is next week so I'm sure I'll have free time then to write.
On my mind...
the fact that I have a midterm paper due tomorrow and have realized that I am sort of confused by my thesis,
how much and how past relationships affect relationships with people now,
is it weird to be the person after the person you loved,
when will I fall in love,
I hope my parents don't move away from the Chicago area; I don't even want to think about that,
time,
my paper is only half done and it is due at 7pm tomorrow,
I feel like I'm losing my memory--there are always so many things on my mind and I keep forgetting things and knowing I've forgotten something but not reminding what it is that I wanted to say/remember,
spring break is going to feel reallly short,
what do I want to do this summer,
will I sail next year (will I have time to?),
I really like my friends at Tufts; I have met so many amazing, interesting, nice, caring, passionate, talented people,
I like and tend to have active friends,
time,
I skipped my first class EVER on Wednesday...it was so easy to skip it (I don't even feel like I missed a class),
I had an interview and an internship offer for this spring (intern at MA Attorney General's office) but, after a night of weighing pros and cons, I declined it because I really don't have time for it right now,
so busy,
it's fun to keep making more friends but hard to see all of them and it's hard to stay in touch with friends from home,
Snood is the most effective time-waster ever,
""Love Is a Battlefield"" is probably the new official song of Christina's and my room (thanks to watching 13 Going On 30 on Thursday night),
I really must get back to my paper right now..."

"event","I think ""Collide"" by Howie Day was the song of 2004 for me.  It captures so many aspects.  The ups and the downs.  2004 was definitely an up-and-down year for me.  It was one of the most eventful years of my life.  I think it may have been one of my best years (second semester senior year, graduation, the summer, college, and more specific things), yet it also included some of the worst weeks of my life.  I had the worst week of my life in March.  Mesa died.  Then two days later I threw up giving blood.  Then that night Max called to tell me that he didn't want to try to get things to work out between us romantically.  Then a week and a half later I found out about college acceptances or not.  So basically the worst thing that has happened to me (Mesa dying) occurred then the week following that got worse and worse.  (I guess I'm lucky that that's the worst that's happened in my life.)  The first week of college was also one of the hardest weeks in my life, adjusting and trying to meet people.  But college is now going very well; I enjoy it immensely.  And last summer was the best summer I've ever had.  All in all, 2004 was a huge year for me, full of many changes and experiences, both positive and negative."

"event","My family and I saw the movie Hotel Rwanda this afternoon.  Oh my gosh.  It was incredible.  I can't believe such horrible genocides occur--and that the western world doesn't do much to end them.  I'm sort of ashamed to be a white American.  The movie was incredibly powerful and has further convinced me that I want to have a job/career in which I can make a positive difference in the world.  What the job does or can do--not what it pays--is what should matter.  (Yet I feel the incongruities in my life, as I plan a shopping trip this week.  But you have to do some things for yourself also and you can't deny yourself pleasures.  But then you also must not forget about others' and their plights.)

I recommend that everyone see Hotel Rwanda.  Wow."

"event","Sometimes I'm just so damn quiet.  Or don't really say anything of importance.  Or, rather, can't think of anything to say.

I need to stop overthinking things and worrying about other peoples' desires, thoughts, and feelings.  I need to just be me and act on my desires without worrying about another person's reaction to me, what I feel, and what I do.  I think that will improve numerous situations and relationships, and then I won't feel so mixed-up inside.

Hence, my new year's resolution is to just be.  (Don't think, just be.)
And just be me and listen to myself.

That will be a heck of a lot harder than it sounds."

I need to work on getting more sleep.  One solution: don't waste so much time!  I got back to my room at midnight, from working with my Econ group.  I was going to go to bed then.  But somehow I stayed up until 2:30.  OY.  I need more sleep!

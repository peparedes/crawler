It's only the second week, but I don't even feel like getting up for classes. For example right now, I'm crying and holding back as much as possible from an anxiety attack. I've never had an ANXIETY attack until last week. I couldn't breathe, I felt like I was going to puke. I'm going to try and finish the semester here and then somewhere else this fall. I'm going to look into somewhere closer to home. It'd also be easier to monitor me on meds if I were home. I don't want to leave my friends, but I have to."

"event","As most of you know, these last couple of weeks have been hell for me. I've been going through a lot of stress and heartbreak and just...ugh. I promised myself that this past weekend I would just try and party it up for the whole weekend. Before I get into Friday, lets go back to Thursday. Thursday night, I had my second drag show ever. I did two numbers; 1) Naked by Margues Houston and 2) Peached N' Cream by 112. I don't have many pictures because the person I gave my camera to was too busy taking pictures of other things than my performance. Needless to say, she won't be having control over my camera anymore. Apparently I did very good with both numbers, even have a mini collection of fan girls. I met this really, really cute girl named Jill. I was flirting like crazy with her. GOOD NEWS: I'm going on a lunch date with this hot girl. You'll see her in the pictures later.

<b>Friday</b>: Original plans were to either attend a house party, go to club Tabu, or drink with Kate. I chose drink with Kate since it had been a while since we hung out. Kate picked me up around 9 or 10 something. We headed over to her friend Matts' place. I met him earlier this semester. (rewind; One night out, I ended up sitting on this guys roof. He was also in one of my classes). Everyone else drank beers and iced tea. Had a little smokey mcpots and then he made this awesome drink for me. A mixture of....something with kool aid. Around midnight I was completely gone, lol. Matt had three other guys come in and they were tripping on acid. One guy was into it so bad his eyes were starting to roll back. It was freaky. At that point though, everything felt so good to me. The music was orgasmic and everything felt so warm and alive. I shit you not when i say i literally wanted to fuck a song, lol. I was listening to this awesome Norah Jones song. We left around 2 since I was falling asleep along with Kates' roomie. In the car, Kate played some Carrie Underwood which, once again, was orgasmic. We all had the munchies really, really badly. MCDONALDS IT WAS! Lemme tell ya, chicken nuggets never tasted so good. Heres how i tried ordering...

Me: I want...four 10-piece chicken nuggets. Yeah.....(thinks)No man, I want two. I'm sure, just two.

Ha, good shit! We got back to Kates' and tried watching Nacho Libre, but crashed. Woke up around noon and played video games with Kate. THIS is why Kate and I should be roomies next year. We get along so well, hehehehe!

I will not interrupt with a picture post. Beware, it's oober long! 
Meet BAM-BAM!

<b>Saturday</b>: Had a floor meeting at two and then took a nap. Went out to club Tabu and it kinda sucked. The DJ was horrible and wouldn't turn the strobe lights off. We had to leave because our eyes were hurting badly. Came back early, around 12:30 am and had to take care of my severly drunken roomie. Not much that night, plus I'm tired now. Hope you all enjoyed this entry. Much love!"

"event","to quote one of my best friends....

""Love is always knowing youll love that person, even when they hurt you, do something awful or hate your guts. Its unconditional in every way and it hurts. Love is that shame you get when you stand next to that person and feel your not good enough for them, its the push to make that person proud, love is burst of light that blinds and crowds out every selfish thought

I know love"" 

Shes right. Regardless how many times I hurt her, or she hurts me, I love her. Regardless if she were to call everyday, or never again, I'd still love her. It sucks. No matter how many times I say I don't or I feel the slightest bit that I don't, It's not true. I wasn't hoping to get back together with her, just love her. Now she doesn't seem to want that. Whats left?"

So on Thursday while everyone was in school,I woke up around 9:30 and finished packing.Arrived at MCC(our leaving site) around 11:30.I had no idea so many people were coming, but they were all pretty cool.Tocarra and her boyfriend Brendon were playing FF on their gameboy d.s.I met a few others,but couldn't remember their names at the time.Of course Alita was there and i finally got to meet Laura,the one who gave me the O.K. to come.Quite cute,I think.Anyhow,we were supposed to leave around noon but didn't go until about 1 something because we had to wait for 'Army Chris'.Yes,i will say a lot of people here had nicknames.While waiting for Chris,we shoved all our luggage into the cars and danced to DDR tunes.

Eventually,we headed out on a 4 hour drive to Toronto.Got there and the hotel was being sort of a buttface,but we got everything situated.Decided who was in what room and then proceeded to head out for some alcohol and cash.That night for the first time ever,I had Jack Daniels.Jaye(the person whos car I was in) mixed it with Coke,but I didn't taste any Coke.So,a glass of Jack Daniels and abut Smirnoffs later,Im completely wasted.Never been drunk before until then.Couldn't quite stand up straight or walk straight,it was wonderful!Only problem was,I didn't really eat,so later that night I got sick.Arg!I fell asleep in the 'drinking room' for a while,then stumbled back to my room,or the 'sober room' and crashed on the floor with barely any blanket freezing my ass off in that air conditioned room.

<h3>Friday</h3>
Woke up that morning I'd say around....8 something.Still tired from going to bed drunk around 2 or 3 am.Brian,Alita,Jay and myself headed out for breakfast over that....TIM HORTONS!The morning was a bit cloudy and rainy.After breakfast,we headed over to try and register,but it was too early.We went back to the hotel where some watched movies,and others were out doing whatever.I slept for a bit,then got sick AGAIN,felt better and changed.I think around 3 pm we finally could register.They made us all wait for a while,but the weather cleared up.I chatted with a few fellow people while waiting in line.This creepy old Canadian man kept yelling and spitting at us.Odd man!Everything opened at 5 pm.I didn't do too much that day since I was trying to see what I would plan to attend to do over the weekend.I got my Kotoko ticket,as well as the Jpop concert ticket.Brian,Alita and myself mostly walked around visiting different panels.Later that night,we crossed the street from the Doubletree Hotel to the Toronto Conference Center(TCC).At the time this was being called,the Buyers Room and Artist Alley.I don't think I bought anything that night.It was more like scoping what I wanted and looking at prices.

Returning to the room around maybe 11 ish,we began watching horrible hentai.It including a boy that whenever he was horny,a demon would come out of him and have a 47 story penis.It was odd.A bunch of us started drinking,which became a love fest.Lestat and Laura were cuddling,Laura asked me to,so I did.Then a few other people were added to the equation.So,heres what it would look like if you were standing up.
        (head board of bed)
--------Alita------------
Walter->Me->Laura->Lestat

then it became

---------Alita------
Army Chris->Me->Laura->Lestat
WALTER ON TOP OF ALL OF US

There was lots of groping of Laura and cuddling.I slept with a guy....NO,NOT SEXUALLY.Army Chris was snuggleg against me.His head was on my chest and he held me.I have a habit of drawing light circles on peoples back when I cuddle.I did it to him and..lets just say,he didn't want his lower half touching me for the rest of the night lol.

<h3>Saturday</h3>
Woke up from my wonderful slumber around 10-ish.That was quite late because we wanted to be at certain things by 8.(A lot of the activites ran all night).My back ached so badly,but Army Chris gave me a nice back massage.I was just about to go take a shower and get dressed,but he reminded me that I owed him.I gave him a back massage in return and before I left,he gave me a kiss on the cheek.Aww,he was a sweety.Quickly hopped in the shower,got ready and headed over to Doubletree for Alita.She was auditioning for J-Idol.Unfortunately she did not get in,but she did great anyway.After that,we immediately lined up for the Kotoko concert.The show was running late and there were clingons for security guards that were effin' annying as hell.After like 2 hours,the show started and Kotoko was amazing and just adorable.She can't speak this confusing language of English all too well,so she brought a cheat sheet.You heard the whole audience go ""Aww,shes sooo cute!"".She dressed as a Canadian Mountee for a few songs to show her love for Canada and the fans.Muah to her.

Brian,Alita and I headed to the Dealers Room.For myself,I bought the Battle Royale shirt,some chocolate suckers,the Paigne necklace from FFX-II,and got an autographed post card from an artist.I REALLY wanted these gothic lolita boots.They had abOut 2 inches of pure rubber,spikes on the top and deep inside the shoe,a compartment in the shape of a coffin.CHA!Before the night was over,we headed to the Impossible Positions activity.It was in the yaoi room(yaoi-gay men manga basically).What we had to do was imitate the sex positions taken from the mangas.I found a few clips of it....If you look closely,you can see Alita and I.Im the black girl in all black with the white girl*I hate saying it like that*.

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et1OypYBaSg"">and hee-ah</a>
We headed back to the hotel,showered and then ate Ramen Noodles from a cup while watching Mind Of Mencia.I was exhuasted and proceeded to once again sleeping with Army Chris.Now,heres how the room was.Julian,Laura,Julians' friend and Lestat took the room portion.Alita,Brian and Jay had the fold out couch.Wang and Nikki slept just in front of it,in the doorway of the room portian.Which left Army Chris and I scrunched in a corner closest to the air conditioner with a chair on each end of us so we couldn't stretch out,and lots of feet in my face.Needless to say,but it wasn't the best night sleep ever.

Don't know who she was,but found it amusing that she had carrots sticking out of her ass as a costume.

<h3>Sunday</h3>
Sunday,we woke up and got ready to go.It was kind of a 'damn,it's the last day of fun' feel.This was the day that we were mostly on our own.Before we headed out,we had to clean the rooms and pack our stuff.We shoved most of our luggage back in the cars and then sprawled out.We were all supposed to meet up again around 4 or 5 to decide what to do.One car had already left.I proceeded to head to the Dealers room and get more cash.I wanted to get stuff for friends that day.I bought 3 Advent Children posters,Advent Children movie,a pin,some snacks,got a sketch done,and a Power Rangers action figure.At some point,I headed back to the Yaoi hall to see what was going on.It wasn't much of an interesting panel,but the girl next to me was cosplaying as Wolverine.CHA,HOTNESS!After I left,I headed back to the Dealers Room to meet up with Alita.We hung out with her Canadian friends and then met up with the bigger group.Before we left,we agreed to make a pit stop at Niagara Falls.

We arrived at N.F. around 7.We wanted to do a haunted house,but was WAY too expensive.We just kind of hung out,got ice cream and watched the fireworks.Playing a few games at an arcade.We left there around 11 to head home.I honestly miss that group already,BUT theres another convention coming up in August.I hope I can go with them again.They are great people!

Im speaking with Sam again which is going well.I guess we really are too much alike.During arguments,we both say a lot of hurtful shit that we later don't mean.True Capricorns we are,bleh.Me and 'she who must not be named' are together now and have been so far for a month plus,almost two.Very happy and Veronica seems to think she is the most level headed girlfriend I've had so far!YAY!

As for OTHER people,it's unforgivable.You cannot just tell someone you LOVE them,make them believe you care so much and then leave them in the dark.I don't know if I'll be abled to handle seeing her at the performing arts show.Arg!

Veronica is starting to get on my nerves.I nkow we are both busy and that she wants to see me,but shes a REALLY big attention hog.It pisses me off because well,thats not how life is damnit.She admitted to me that she doesn't like change,but I need to get her used to it.For my sake and the sake of herself and other people.I guess Im just getting a grip that college is closer than I thought and some of the people I see everyday now,I might not see for the rest of my life.Im just preparing myself so it hurts less in the end.

But,I have good news.The parental unit has decided to finally let me start riding public buses to go places that I want or need to go since she can't really drive right now.If I have to,I will catch a bus from here to downtown.And then find a bus to East Irondequoit.Also,this fall when Veronica gets her liscence,she can drive me on the way to see her girlfriend."

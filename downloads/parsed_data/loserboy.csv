"event","This past weekend was not what I expected it to be.  I went to Austin to go see my sister at UT.  I stayed at a motel.  You would expect it to be a roach motel, but it was actually a cricket hotel because the room that I stayed in was infested with crickets.  I went to Austin on Friday and that night I saw a drunk guy pee on someone's truck.  Being so amused by this, it was then that I realized that I am not quite ready to deal with all the people that act like idiots when they are free to do whatever they want. On Saturday I had to go with my sister to one of her nursing meetings.  It was quite boring with all the lectures and touring of the nursing building.  Then I went back to my personal hell I call my home town.  I was a little bit eager to go home because I was going to meet some college friends of mine, but they ended up leaving me because I got home late.  What did I do after that?  Why, pre-cal and computer science homework of course.  Shows you what kind of life I have on saturday nights.  Sunday I spent the whole day working on more homework.  Fortunately I have monday off, so I can slack off a little bit.  That's about all."

"event","If you don't want to hear me complain about how much life sucks, then I suggest you hit the ""back"" button on the toolbar because I'm going to.  I'm going to complain about my dick of a chem teacher.  He is the worst.  This past week I didn't know that we had a homework assignment in class, so I started to do the work in class.  Then Mr. Dick says that he is going to start punishing students like me who don't do their homework and help students that do, such as the whore cheerleader who always seems to be on the good side of teachers because of her breasts and slutty mien.  This cheerleader is always peppy and upbeat and, honestly, it sickens me, so of course she is always the hero of the day.  The problem with this guy is that he is a complete pedophile.  He is always touching girls and squeezing their shoulders and he can get away with it because he is a teacher.  Today there was a pep rally to glorify the people at my school who really don't deserve it.  I, of course, didn't go.  I also am making a ""B"" in pre-cal which my parents will shoot me for, but I don't really care.  Today in English I found out I made a 98 on an essay over The Scarlet Letter, but my english teacher is a male, so cheerslut will probably get a 100 if she does her act right. Well, c'est la vie."

"event","Well, I've tried updating my journal for the past couple of days, but livejournal hasn't let me.  A couple of days ago I got really angry at my history teacher, Coach Blowhard.  My class was taking a quiz, when this drill team whore talks during one of the bonus questions about how she heard one of the questions on a game show.  I was going to put my opinion in and say ""me too"", but coach suckass all of a sudden goes ""SSHHHHHHHHH"".  This doesn't surprise me because this coach will let any girl members of the Friday Night Football bullshit experience get away with anything as long as they promise him oral sex.  He just really is discriminating.  Hmm, not much happened this weekend (I'm trying to act surprised).  I mostly read the scarlet letter, and finished it up and did a mini research project on it.  I think I'm going to write a novel.  I just came up with this conclusion a couple of days ago.  Who knows, I might just get a career out of it.  One thing that really angered me this past weekend was my parents.  Saturday they tried to get me to do with something with them.  I refused so they got fried chicken.  I hate fried chicken, but my parents did get me some cole slaw.  Of course, the cole slaw had to be ruined when I found a pubic hair in it.  Oh yeah, and there is someone besides my parents who are angering me.  It's a friend of mine.  It's a long story, but I have a feeling that she thinks she knows me like the back of her back hand, but she really doesn't.  I really hate it when she says ""that's not like you""  to me.  Like she knows whether it's me or not.  She says ""people all the time change"", yet she never thinks that maybe I'm changing my feelings about the world.  Oh well, that's all."

I hate my history teacher.  I guess I have a thing against the social studies.  My history teacher is a coach so he let's any drill team member or cheerleader get away with anything in class as long as they promise to give him a blowjob. A couple of days ago, my class was taking an oral quiz.  When one of the bonus questions was asked this drill team whore says ""I know the answer to this question, I heard the answer on Jeopardy!""  then I say, ""yeah so did I""  While I was putting in my two cents worth Coach Dickhead goes ""SHHH, Shut up!""  I was so pissed off then. Sorry if I offend any drill team prostitutes or coaches or anyone else that's involved in the whole friday night football bullshit, but I hate you people...wait what am I saying? I don't care what you think!  My parents were trying to get me to do something this weekend with them, but I kept refusing. So tonight, my parents got fried chicken for dinner. I hate fried chicken and they didn't tell me they were going to get me chicken, but they did bring home some cole slaw with a pubic hair in it (yummy).  Tommorrow I have homework for coach alpha-male.  That's just great."

Today I learned that cities such as Los Angeles and Boston are paying millions of dollars to have public, self cleaning toilets on the streets, and it costs 25 cents to use it.  After 20 minutes of using the bathroom the door unlocks making it possible for other people to come in.  This prevents prostitutes and drug dealers to have a ""private"" place on the street.  I have two tests this coming friday (spanish and computer science).  Oh well that's all."

"event","So I haven't written in a long time for good reason.  Now all of my time is dedicated to my precious school, but it's all right because I didn't have much of a social life this summer.  All of my friends are gone.  My last two friends who live in the same city as me have gone to college, leaving me as a junior in high school. High school is a bitch, but I'm not complaining.  It's better than not doing anything at home, but I will definitely not take summer for granted.  I am in a lot of classes with people that I don't exactly like.  Most of them are suck ups and will kiss a lot of teacher's asses.  I like my teachers.  I am in debate and we don't do a thing.  The one class that I can't stand is U.S. History, but I never was a fan of the social studies.  Anways there isn't much else to say.  My mom is going to force me to be in Student Council because I need serious scholarship padding.  Oh well, I'm just hoping that I won't have a nervous breakdown by the end of the school year."

I went there in kindergarten and I thought it was fine, but now I feel that it belongs with other places such as my house on the list of ""Places I would rather not be"".  There was a the music, the robotic chuck, and children everywhere.  I think the music was the worse.  Every song Chuck sang had the same melody, but different words.  I found it to be one of the most retarded places I  have ever been to.  I didn't play any of the games there.  Someone gave me a token, but I just threw into a crowd just to see what the reaction would be.  That was the most fun I had while there.  If it weren't for the people I went with, I might have just poked my eyeballs out with a fork.  I find it a bit coincidental that Chuck E. Cheese has a name similar to a homicidal doll of Satan.  Then the party went to someone's house, and on the way they played stupid sexually oriented games.  I left at ten because it is a work night for my dad and I have to be home by that time.  Then I read the paper and noticed that this school year my school starts at 8 in the morning.  There is only one week left of summer and I am pretty excited."

All I could think about was all the oxygen she was wasting by talking to me about her son's stupid wedding!  I kept thinking ""Is this lady ever going to shut up?""  I maybe got one sentence in.  Then, a friend of the lady came in, those two had so much in common.  For example, they both have the capability to talk until the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride into town.  This new lady could only talk about her new car and how she would kill anybody that touched it.  After she said that, I decided to abstain from talking to her and stay away from her car. The lady also talked about how her child needed braces, and I thought that it would take more than braces to make her daughter look better. I also thought about how these two ladies definitely spend their afternoons at the country club drinking margaritas and spreading all the gossip that they've heard floating around in the god-forsaken town I live in.  I checked out a book today called On the Road by Jack Kerouac, and one of the incessant talkers said ""Oh your going to check out a book, good for you!"", and I was thinking ""What, do I look incapable of reading a book larger than The Cat in the Hat?""  She then said that she has never heard of the book, and I just thought how I'm surprised she knows what a book is.  Today my mom also talked to me about how she was worried that people might think that I am ""weird"" because of the way that I talk to people in public and the fact that I don't like to talk to people my own age.  That really pissed me off.  I went to sleep because I was really tired after the conversations with that lady.  Tomorrow I will be all by myself at home and it will be great.  I was also invited to a birthday party next thursday.

Today I caught two little boys urinating in my yard, and I was wondering how that thought came into their minds.  That is basically the highlight of my day.  Nothing else happened.  There is less than a month left until school starts, and I need to find a book bag that is capable of holding about 9 textbooks in it.  That should be a challenge.

Then the most surprising thing happened.  An old friend whom I thought I wasn't friends with anymore called me and invited me to go to wal-mart.  This shows you the size of the town I live in.  We talked while at wal-mart basically to confirm that I was still alive.  She then brought me home and I realized that I wasted 30 minutes of my life socializing with this person.

"event","I have just wasted about 10 minutes of my life reading some idiots journal entries that composed of statements such as ""cows are yummy"" and events that involve cockroaches.  These statements were such a waste of my time.  I have noticed that many people just make up single statements that make no sense, and call them journal entries.  I think that this is the dumbest thing I have ever seen on the internet besides the dancing hampsters.  I thought that the point of having an online journal was to keep entries of your life so that voyeuristic people can read about your pathetic life, not make up stupid statements that make no sense and don't reflect any point of your worthless life.  I guess acting stupid online is the cool thing to do these days, but I'm not sure because I have no desire to be cool, nor am I stupid.  Maybe people think that adding pointless statements to there journals makes there ""journals"" more personalized, and that they will be the only ones to understand them.  To anyone that thinks that, I say ""You are stupid, and probably on crack, go to hell.""  I say the same thing to anyone that does put pointless statements in their journals. These people might think that they are so ""individual"", but I think that there is nothing ""individual"" about being a dumbass in a cyberworld full of other dumbasses.  If anyone reading this real journal entry does write single statement journal entries, I'm sorry for offending you.  Actually I don't really care whether I offend you or not because you should probably just be shot.  At least that would rid us of one pointless journal."

I went to a wedding on saturday, and it was just the dumbest thing in the world. it was a texas a&m wedding, so they had all those stupid traditions.  Today I learned that I was the random journal entry one day.  I wonder how they pick those.  I wonder if they read the entries, and pick whose are the most interesting, or if it is just luck of the draw, which would be weird because I'm never lucky.  I wonder how many people read my entries.  I bet they all thought it was the dumbest one they've ever read.  Thanks to the person that actually posted a reply.  well i have to go."

"event","First day of summer, and I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO bored.  I want school to start up again.  I had to spend the whole day getting ready for my sister and her husband to come home.  It was a real drag.  I have to sleep on the floor tonight and tomorrow night.  I got my driver's permit.  I can finally drive legally.  I really don't care about this fact, but I'm sure that other people my age would."

"event","I woke up and went to school, nothing new except that it was the last day of the school year, and, for some reason, people were crying a lot.  I thought it was just a bunch of people with emotions who were crying because it was the end of the schoolyear.  Turns out a person from our school died.  Well you know I have to do something stupid, so during the first period, i just said how stupid it was that people were crying (this was before I knew that that person died, but I don't feel it would have changed much).  I also said that I would be glad that for two whole months, I wouldn't have to see a lot of people that I don't want to see.  Since today was just an exam day, I got out of my exams, so I went to Burger King with some friends that are graduating tomorrow.  Then I went back to school to take a BCIS exam.  It was easy, and I am pretty sure I made a 100.  Then I went home and faced invevitable boredom.  I couldn't talk to Lauren of course because she left early this morning.  I spent the whole day watching t.v.  Then I went to the DPS office to get my permit renewed, but I failed the eye test.  It seems that I am failing easy tests a lot more often.  I then went back home and my family drove me crazy.  It seems that my parents, sister, and I now communicate by yelling at each other.  I am getting pretty ticked off at my sisters,  I don't know why, but I am.  I am still looking for work, and I'm beginning to feel like I won't get any kind of job that I will  like.  Today I also just read a book and listened to Led Zeppelin.  This was the best part of today, and I now think that reading is SOOO much better than watching t.v.  One of my sisters came today , and I should've been excited, but I wasn't because I feel like I am changing.  My family is beginning to tick me off for no apparent reason.  At 9:30, a friend of mine called.  This friend used to be one of my best friends, but now she has really changed, so we're not as close as we used to be (not even minutely close).  Despite this, she wanted me to go to a coffee shop with her, but I declined.  I lied to her and said that I was fixing to go to sleep, but the real reason was that I just didn't feel like hanging around with the Coffeehouse idiots, answering questions such as ""If you were a cheese, what kind of cheese would you be?"", and all that crap.  Oh well, I feel that the only reason why she did this was because of the fact that Lauren is gone.  It seems so strange that Lauren is gone, but I am sure that I will cope."

"event","Well, on mon. i went to school, but later that night i had to challenge for my cpr certification.  I didn't pass the written portion...twice.  So i didn't get my certification, but that's all right because i can challenge again on this coming mon. Besides, my sister didn't pass the skills part so we're both in the same boat.  On tues. i went to school and took an exam.  It was easy, and i made a 100 on it.  Then there was today where i didn't have to go to school, and i'm eating lunch with lauren which is good because she is leaving tomorrow (which is sad).  I also learned that i didn't get the job of lifeguard that i applied for.  But that's ok because i didn't want to work at that place anyway.  Today i also pondered about all the little children that have cars these days.  i don't but it seems that everyone else i know does.  I feel like a loser, but at the same time i don't because i don't want to drive.  That, and the fact that i don't even have my permit.  Another thing i thought about was how boring my life is.  No one spreads rumors about me (at least i think they don't), and i have a lack of a social life.  I don't do much on friday and saturday nights but that is okay, because there isn't much to do in little southeast tx.  Well that pretty much explains what i've done in the past couple of days.  So i'll see you later."

"event","Well, today is just another day of the world hating me.  My mom informed me that many people affiliated with the band program at my high school are very mad at me.  For any of you that don't know, i quit band this past year to take part in other classes because band sucked.  For some reason the band director is mad at me.  I don't know why but im sure it has something to do with the fact that i quit because many band members would die if there were no band program.  Not only that but there is a janitor at the school mad at me for some reason involving the fact that i left my trash on a lunch table and she had to pick it up.  she called me disrespectful but i believe that she is just a bitch. ahh well that's about all."

"event","well i start a journey of online journals.  This is pretty not exciting.  The idea of keeping an online journal was from a friend, her name is lauren. She's one of the few friends i have as my name implies.  I am a sophomore at a high school in southeast tx.  it sucks.  everyday i fight the forces of bumbling idiots.  tomorrow is another day. well that's about it. see you."

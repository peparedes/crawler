"event","As you many of you may or may not know, I am away until the 19th of July at one of the worlds most beautiful places. But for the sake of being smart and not risking getting stalked by some random psycho, I would rather not state where I am. 

Everyday, I breathe fresh and clean air and see ground squirrels and deer from my balcony. The trees, mountains is what I see on the top of 4th floor of the dinning hall and I am breathless. I fear for the sake of over-indulgence because the food is so divine. It's literally a buffet every meal. The dessert selection is so diverse, so dangerous...

The first day I arrived, I was in awe. I kept taking pictures, getting adjusted to the wonderful luxurious life at the centre. We get endless privileges such as room service; somebody makes my bed everyday and cleans my bathroom. We have unlimited access to entertainment...not the dirty kind, but the musical and arts. 

The 6th floor in our hall has a killer view, I made a joke about how people went up to the 6th floor to jump off the balcony if they had creative block :P I guess it wasn't too funny because everyone sort of just looked at me. 2nd floor has a ping-pong table.&nbsp; 

The first official class (June 30), I saw my teacher from my last Semester at McGill. It was pleasant. I saw Ian again and it was all smiles. I went into town but, I took the long way (stupid me). I was so sore afterward. I forgot my bathing suit so I went to Billabong and got a hot orange two piece. I think it just topped my favorite.

The next day (July1), I had to play at the masterclass. Ian was my adviser. He was so funny and all his ideas were so creative! At one point, him and Mark even waltzed in order to make a point on a passage of my piece. The most embarrassing part was when I had to play the piano. I almost died because I haven't read the bass cleft in ages. However, I managed to pull through. Whew! 

Later that day my roomy and I went out to go see fireworks with my roomy. We went to town twice that day. The first time, I took her to Billabong and then I ran to dinner and then to Orchestra rehearsal. Afterward, we went to get some ice cream and then fireworks :) The ice cream was from Cows. I had apple pie and I recommend it!

The fireworks was so beautiful. I was in awe. However, there were all sorts of stupid couples making out in front of me. I couldn't stand it! I had to just drink afterward so Alex and I headed back and went to the pub and I had two drinks. I took so many pictures, poses influenced by alcohol. No jokes. 

Next day (Jul 2), I slept in and then took it easy. We had some rehearsals and I went swimming after dinner. I swam some laps, played shark with some friends and soaked in the chlorine water, wishing I was soaking in mineral water. After, I headed back to my place (we are connected to the gym and get unlimited access). I took a nice bath and then my roomy and I ordered pizza and watched a movie. I fell asleep shortly after.

Today, we had a master class to attend, then I went to get some tickets for concerts this week, ran to lunch, then to rehearsal. My butt was really numb from the chairs. We finally got to rehearse with Jon Kimura Parker! He was absolutely wonderful! The sound that came out of that Steinway was like waterfalls cascading. 

I met Jon at the concert after dinner. He was such a nice guy and I think that it really shows in his playing. I liked the concert, but I am afraid that I could only take contemporary music in small doses. I have developed the world's&nbsp; largest headache.&nbsp; 

Anyhow, as much as I love the place, I feel a bit homesick. I appreciate and cherish all of my friends and family more since I am away. It is strange to be surrounded by music, animals and nature. Everything is vibrant yet, so still. 

My heart is not still. It always longs and hungers with passion. It pangs from loneliness, even when I am hanging out. I figured that any sort of art is lonely and inspiration must be formed within that ballad.&nbsp;"

The answer is yes. I love him with all my heart. I cannot think straight right now. My heart hurts but I don't want to admit it. Not right now, so I smile and nod with a yes, I am alright just to protect myself and my image. Aren't I silly? I wish he had the time and capacity for me now. I guess I want to still wait and see. I will probably pray about it again."

For this week, she has either not shown up at all or is late for rehersals. I want to kill her. Today at coaching we sounded terrible! It was all thanks to her. We practiced our parts, but barely rehearsed. I dont know what to do anymore. We talked to her calmly. Everyone agrees she is useless. I want to very badly tell the coach, especially because she has been late to all our coachings. Also, she is so stupid! She never organizes her life. I cant stand her anymore and I dont know if I want her as a friend.... I hate people who are irresponsible. What the heck should I do?</font>"

"event","Happy Birthday Professor Andrew Dawes! Not only do your students love thee but one of them, well, me, admire you completely and whole-heartedly. Not only do you make my day with the way you help motivate me to keep on trying harder but the way you are there for me. Thank you for everything! Not only is it an honor to be your student but an honor to be studying with one of my favorite violinist of all time :) Your playing is like a fountain of bliss pouring down with this sweet amazing tone that melts with sentimentality and warmth. You make Canada proud!

Yesterday, WE had the longest masterclass~ I played part of the Brahms violin concerto (first movement). My bow hair broke. I was so freaked out of my mind I thought I was going to choke. But then I pulled this very cheesy act that I dance with my music. OMG~ I didn't know I had it in me to become a total sway-er. I danced to my own performance...especially the ice-skating part with the tenths :D I call it the ice-skating part! DON'T steal my line or I will have to break some bones! My pianist was amazing :D As always! Hehehe~ A-yeon Kim ...How I love thee, uhnee~ HEHE~ After, we played the moto-perpetuam by paganini. WE sounded too robotic and rushed. Before then, we suprised Andy with a happy birthday :D It was neat. Before that, Andy quickly pat my arm and smiled his huge happy smile :D HE is especially hard on me though... I have kind of wondered about that... Nora noticed that too. Hmmm... Anyway, we heard this incredible lecture on vibrato and it was absolutely amazing! We all giggled becaused he was looking at us and announcing flaws. He stopped looking at us afterwards.

LOL~ His wife made us gingerbread....SHE is an amazing woman! I love her purple-dyed hair. I think I will do that too! Well, streaking it. I LOVE PURPLE! Absolutely love it! I guess I have the royalty syndrome afterall... Awell. Andy's wife told us about the fact her friend Susan Leaderman who tagged along Andy's and the mississ' date while they were in U of T. It was absolutely hilarious! He also counter-attacked my intonation...again LOL~ My goal is to make him stop and become his fav student ;) Anyway, Christopher Robins asked how I reached tenths with my small hands. Andy replied smuggly, OUT OF TUNE ! And slapped me on the arm while laughing .... ouch T_T I think I really want to improve now. I am going to harrass my teacher. I love him so much! I love him! Even though we have debates about pitches...he has relative. I have perfect. Curses! Curses! LOL~ Well, that's that. Here is a cheer for one of the greatest teachers in the world!"

Although I try to hide it, mask it, pretend and all, I just cant face the fact that I am alone. It's true, it sucks and all, but can you truly tell yourself everyday to toughen up and not to cry if someone was there with? I am not trying to make a victim out of myself. I mean, I know it's my fault too and all, but still... I just want him to take notice more; perhaps do the usual bf thing like stroking my hair and letting me know it is going to be alright by embracing me, I want her to tell me everything is going to be alright and I need a friend who I could cry to. I can't for some odd reason permit myself to do that anymore. I can't let go and I feel to sorry to waste everyone's time. What the hell is wrong with me? Why can't I stop being sad?"

"event","It occured to me that I forgot what happiness really means. The state and formal being. I feel that at times, I am my own worst Enemy. I don't mean to be vain and troubled, but I am only human. I know there are people far worse off than myself, but I feel that my life is just too complicated.

Case Study 1: I am who I am. I am a musician and though, my status is still undetermined as far as which level I am at, Music is a lifelong journey. End of story. I know ever since I began, I started to think only about music. I loved the glamour of it all. To explain such a thing would be dancing like architecture. Though, I sadly regret I never gave anything else a chance, even though I had a passion for many things. One is art. I am a terrible person when it comes to modern art. I am very conservative in regards to that. I love the way music and art are inter-connected and therefore, I compare a lot of music with art and in my mind, I sometimes play a piece in my head which I feel would be appropriate with a certain painting. At one point or another, I felt that I needed to change myself. I fell deeply in love with someone and they meant the world to me. They still me a lot to me, but I realized that if I changed myself, I wouldn't be the same person they could love. So my eccentric side prevails and I am once again in the wrath of music; loneliness.  I bet none of you knew that about me. Any profession or form of art is a lonely career. That is why we long for companionship.

Case Study 2: I fell in love again for the second time. I thought that love prevails because of my hopeful, optimistic, romantist side. I never thought that I would be able to do it the second time around but it happend. Though, it was and still is a very painful process. To be profound, I long for certain things, but not a wedding anytime soon, nor a family. I don't mean to sound so inconsistent with what I want. Don't get me wrong, I want a relationship that can blossom into a potential future, but, right now, having kids and a marriage is far from my mind. Okay, mentioning this is quite odd, but it is true. This is a re-evaluation. It opened up my eyes when I saw my sister's kids. I can barely handle 2 kids as an aunt, what makes you think I can handle more? Relationship cons: You get attatched and dependant emotionally on the person. You also start to lose some focus. That is the truth. Pros: You have someone to hold, you learn; to let go, to laugh again, to love, to have fun, to relax and you have someone you can talk to and possibly trust.

Conclusion: To love and to hold is far better than to lose and regret. I still love him and I pray for us everyday. I don't know what God wants, but I know what I want and that is a start."

"event","My birthday
Today, I would like to dedicate this entry to those who remembered my bday and made it extra special: Vivian, Jules, Clairebear, Haley, Simon-Marc, Sophito, Paulo, Nettie, Yan and yes, Parents. I want to especially thank Vivian for being such a sweetheart and dragging my ass out of my house and making my day special.

So here is what I did in the morning:
Woke up at 7:30, practiced scales, had breakfast with family, argued with a infuriating father and cried. Then, I went to church with my brother and we had a few funny moments there. One of them was when the worship music team's pianist screwed up and changed into a different key randomly; we started over again and laughed. The second was when we had to greet everyone that was a different ethnicity; Paulo and I were the few asians that attends this church so everyone practically came to us ^^ hehehe. Third was when after the pastor said ""In Jesus' name, Amen"" a baby who barely spoke cried out ""amen"".  After church I headed home.

Afternoon:
Viv picked me up from my home (which is way out in the boonies). She is so sweet. We went to West Edmonton Mall and we ate cake...pardon me, I ate my cake and half of hers. I guess I am declared queen, eh Viv? LOL! It was soooo good! I never had the cakes from Death by Chocolate until today! I am being bad today! LOL! We talked and had an awesome time...at least I did! Sadly, I did not know that Aritzia was in WEM so Viv took me, picked out these really cute skirts and got an awesome deal! Thanks Viv ^^ Next time, we are definately going shopping for your stuff ^_^ Sadly, we had to depart. But that was the best part of my day!

Evening:
Ate dinner with family (dad made his specialty: crab and mom made some bap and sauteed veggies). I am afraid I was way too stuffed! But I did enjoy dinner immensely. Mom had to go to Choir so we ate dinner early. Will eat a piece of the cake that my family had gotten me. I think I will have too many sweets and I will definately go work out tomorrow (will have to double the cals too!). So far, I am a size four and I have been working lots on my body so that I am in ship-shape for my audition...apparently, looks do matter. I will tell you all the rest of my story. My cake is a hello kitty cake btw. Hmm...

For those of you who have remembered my Bday, Thank you so much! All of you also contributed in making this 21st Bday an extra special one :) I love ya all! Will continue to update this today...until midnight. I will be having my party next month because I want to celebrate it with everyone. It will be the weekend of March 17 & 18. It will be huge and I will be expecting each and every one of you there! Except for those who live way out of alberta. It will be formal, so dress up and pucker up! HEHEHE... The reason it is so late is because I dont have time (audition in NYC) and I want 21st to be an exciting party! Will see you all there!"

I am hurting in so many unimaginable ways possible. I wish that I could be a strong christian and lean on God, but for some strange reason, I feel like a damaged good that is far beyond repair. I don't have regrets about the last 15 months of my life, yet, I do wish some things were better. I miss you, where are you when I need someone to hold me and let me know things are going to be okay? Where were you when my heart was hurting so badly that I bled, literally... Where were you when I was laying restless during the past 3 months? Why don't you call me? Why do you forsake me? Why do you haunt me like the black maurader you are? Why do I think of you? WHY WHY WHY?????????? I want to be happy again. I know that I could probably live without you, but I would rather not. I would love to feel that my days are worth living for and that we have hope still... I would love for you to grow up. So won't you please stop hiding in the shadows and make up your fucking mind? I can't explain the pain you have caused me. If anything happens to hurt you, such as the situations I have encountered, know this; YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT UPON YOURSELF! I loved you and gave you my whole heart. WHAT DO YOU WANT?! IF YOU WANT TO BREAK IT OFF, BE A MAN AND TELL ME!!! What do I owe you? I think at the very least, you owe me honesty. You can't keep taking, I have nothing to give. I am naked at this very moment. Stripped of all that is good. I do not know if anything good and tender is still within me. I feel so inadequate to this world and of no use. I do not know what to feel right now except the pain you've caused me. Do not deceive me any longer. I want to know what the hell I am suppose to do. SHOULD I BREAK IT OFF? Would it make things easier for you? Why do you fear life so much? Why are you so damned scared of the world? I can burn bridges too. I can be cold. Just ask me to and I will walk away. Make it easier on me please. PLEASE! I BEG THAT YOU PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY."

Fat chance we will be together forever. But this guy, he is so sweet. He was really sincere and I'm afraid if something happens, Jack's friendship with Clay and that guy will be complex.

"event","Thank you Amalia for helping me kill some of the pain and helping me realize some things today. I know I have fucked up. I am still in a relationship and I love my boyfriend. I think what I really need to do is do my own thing. It's hard to do that when you are hurting, but sometimes, we over-analyze the hurt and make it worse. So, in conclusion, I have decided to let him be. 

I love him and trust him. He is in a beautiful place, and maybe he needs time to grow, just like a plant. Not that I am saying that my boyfriend is a vegtable, but boys mature much slower than girls. 

I know he has a special place in my heart and in my own terms, I have to build more skill in interacting more for my life. I know this sounds dreadfully easy, though, it most definitely is not. It never will be. So, I've decided to do an open relationship, after he comes back. In our mind, we are together still. My heart has told me so. 

I am so lucky today that Amalia helped me figure this one out. Yes, I am jealous about the fact that he is not with me and I have had so many sad things happening, but I have to let that one go because I love him. So I will do that and do my own thing. My life does include him, but does not revolve around him.

"event","No matter how worse matters get, always turn to look at the bright side. You never know what is just around the corner. Yesterday, my honey was very late meeting me. I got all frightend and I thought something horrible had happend to him. Especially because I have not heard from him~ I was relieved when I heard his voice, more relieve than upset anyway. I just concealed it by pretending to feel upset at the fact that he was late. I did show a little bit of my worry wort side. I think yesterday made me realize how much I care for him. I think if I were never to feel his arms tightly around me, his warm chin resting on my head, his sweet and tender kisses and his fast heartbeat against mine, I would die emotionally. It also made me realize, if I ever lose him, I lose my soulmate, and I lose a big chunk of myself. Yesterday, we went to our ""rendezvous spot"" which is right next to my house, by an abandoned shack with a wonderful view of the Saskatchewan River. IT was quite adventurous. We had discovered how messy and fixable the shack was and then we got attacked by bees... they were building a nest! IT was quite frightening, especially the winds provoking the darned bees. I looked into his eyes and found myself in them, shinning brightly, boldly, and bravely. As many of you know, I am not too confident about myself, I am shy when it comes to dating and I am a hardass. All that melts away when HE is around. IT occured to me during the long time we stayed together, he began to become my lucky star. When I met him, it was comfirmed that I was born lucky: I was meant to have him so therefore, I am lucky by fate. He is my confidante and hopefully I am his. We hold each other because it feels right as rain, and because we follow our hearts. I cannot be with anyone else and feel this. It is like saying to feel the same emotions for a replica when you see a the real ""Cafe Terrace at Night"" by Van Gough. Another likely comparison which is close to my experience is feeling the same for carlos when I play the 1 M Guadignini in a violin shop. Carlos is wonderful, but he isnt robust. I know its no excuse for how I play. It's true, the violin is all about skills. If you havent got any, you might as well take your fiddle and break it across your knee. I am not saying I am superb, however, let's just put it in terms of if I were horrible, I wouldnt be persuing it. I am so very lucky this year. I have to realize this more often and I am appreciating it more as it is time to depart. I love the breeze of summer... it must be true when they say ""Summer Love"". I am putting it my practicing. It is so sentimental and warm."

I hate it when HE has to leave. T'adore.  My neck looks like it has been mangled around and people give me dirty looks, thanks to Carlo's perverseness. That's right, my violin is a perv who makes my bf look like a bigger perv. I think I might be going crazy due to the mice. I hope they have a painful death. Stupid mice. Why am I so bitter? 

Whenever he isn't around, I miss him. I want to cherish every second we are together, keep it forever, in my heart. I miss him whenever he isn't holding me. I could hold him forever and it would still not be long enough. What does the bloody future hold? Why does fear strike every moment of my life? Why is life so complicated? Why is it everytime someone or something good comes in my life I feel I have more to lose? I want to know what my future holds. What is out there for me? Why am I feeling both lost and found? I don't want to have to choose. I don't need this, I have to fight to keep everything. Why can't I let some things go? I have found that my instincts were usually right. I know deep down in my heart, he is the one I have been waiting for, the one to enter my life. The one I will be happy with, even with all his flaws, imperfections and such. Our heart beats as one and our thoughts are almost always the same. We read each other without speaking and we understand each other. Most importantly, we trust each other and we wait for each other. He makes me feel patient. I will wait for him forever if I have to. I feel that the best part of me comes out whenever he is around. I know if I ever let him go, I will lose the best part of my heart. I can't do it. I won't do it, unless he tells me to go. I hate it when people say that WE can't be an item, even indirectly such as ""Jo, you got to face reality, it's too hard to do an LD, it is most likely to fail when you leave..."" The sad truth is those close to me who have said that to have failed me. It seems as though the only person who has faith is me. I know it is a risk and I will be vulnerable to hurt, however, it is worth it. I won't give him up without a fight. Those bitches who want to put their slutty hands on him can all feel my wrath. Remember, anyone who plans to make me cross, think before you try anything, you might end up wishing you weren't born. YOU hear me (all you nosy creepers who want him)? He and I gave our hearts to each other and if you want to know, this is the proclaimation of what he is to me. A proclaimation of my love to him. He is my soulmate so you can all take your hoochiness shove it in someone else's man because you sure aren't taking mine."

"event","Yesterday was wonderful. I spent the evening with my honey and his parents. We went to Bravo's and talked about many interesting aspects of politics and about biased media. It was quite good fun. After, we went to the Winspear Center for ESO's pop series concert. There was a lot of dancing. Some of it included; ballet, jazz, tap, broadway, tango, ballroom, celtic and more... I had an immensely enjoyable night. After, Clay took me home. However, before he did, we spent a little more time together. We also made promises that we would wait for each other and not see anyone, even when I leave. Also, we promised each other to stay faithful. It was divine. I think I found the right one and that God sent me my prince. I want a future with him, I know there is the risk of getting hurt involved. I'll take my chances. We have potential and all the time in the world, well, hopefully. We'll see. I love being his girlfriend. What we have is more than a relationship. Could he perhaps be my soulmate?"

Wow, time is running! I still think we are pretty young nonetheless. We went for a walk in the park. It was good fun. We were both dressed up and it was inappropriate walking attire. LOL. The weather was beautiful and so is he. I am so greatful to God that I have a wonderful boyfriend. He has been a wonderful friend as well. No one can understand the nature of our relationship except ourselves. It is a deep, meaningful and sincere story, the story of us. Distance makes the heart grow fonder. We have made some commitment and sacrifice. We have been through both sorrow and joy together. He holds my heart, hand and myself. I know I have made myself vulnerable to being hurt, however, I will take that risk, if it means living one more happy day, then I will take that journey. I am troubled when I forget all the good I have been given. I must hold on to all things I consider dear to my heart. Never let go to my dreams. He is one of my dreams. I hope that I will not awaken from this dream anytime soon."

"event","Bonjour! Je suis tres content parce-que de ma garcon! Je l'aime ma garcon. Je lui veux que nous sommes content toujours.
 
Alright, enough with the french. I'm not that good anyways! LOL...
As you can all see, I am in love. I have said it repetitively many many times but I truly mean it. I hope this feeling lasts, although there is always a chance it wont.

Today, for starters, we met in the evening which is kind of different. We went for bubble tea, then took a walk at Hawrelak park. My hands were getting near frostbite from holding the bubble tea and the cold wind blowing. We held hands with our free hands. We talked, spent time gazing and enjoying the moment and watched the sunset while he drove me back. It was sadly poetic when the sun decided to bid adieu because it was time for both of us to part again. Everytime we do part, I appreciate him more. When I don't see him for more than a week, it makes me triste, yet, I am strong about it. 

It takes a really long time for some people to realize it (I am, unfortunately, in that group), however, in order to love someone, one must love himself/herself. The moment someone you love makes you feel good, is the moment you realize you love yourself as well...as vain as this may sound, it's true. You realize that you are a creature that possesses some sort of beauty. You feel confident. Rarely anyone is attracted to an inconfident person, a negative person or a stuck up person. Insecurities are key to ruining the positive vibes. Negativity just makes one really upset or angry. I feel that with confidence in life, everything can be alright, it is just the way you perceive things. Don't dwell on the past, however, consider it so that you may learn from your mistakes. What you lost is gone and will never be unless some bloody miracle decides to waltz back into your life. Embrace reality but do not be a pessimist, as that is highly unattractive. 

Wit and sarcasm can really ruin a relationship if it is used too much. Teasing can be alright as long it isn't used ineffectively. Sometimes, name-calling can be a bit too much. Try to avoid those. Life is not a big puffy cloud you can enjoy, but, rather a sour soother; both bitter and sweet. Someone will always fall in love with you without knowing. Your hotness should not be determined by the public but rather how you act in life. Cuteness is a natural trait. Everyone has it. Only creeps realize it and over-use it so that they become stalkers. 

I dont love everything in my life and not everything is perfect but it is good enough for me and I am living in it, blow-by-blow, piece-by-piece, moment-by-moment. I count the na-no seconds for my dream life to really begin. Dreams are what you make of it."

"event","It has been a crazy 3 months since our first date. Today was wonderful. I spent the a few hours with my significant other and things just seem to get better each time we meet. We saw ""Hitch"" together (really good movie, I recommend it) and took crazy photos...ones my parents should never see or I would most likely be burried alive. *nervous chuckles* I wish my mother would stop telling me what is is not good for me. She likes him but doubts my judgement. I know that I am capable of making my own decisions. I love him, that's that. If we don't end up together, I will have to accept that, yet cherish the happiness and not dwell on it's past. I wish that I could practice, for once, I would like to express the bliss I am experiencing. In this lifetime, at the age of 20, I feel like I have succeeded in many ways. For one, I have overcome the pain of my past, that of which no longer haunts me and I have become whole again. Not because of another person, but because of self-realization. I don't know what the future holds, but one thing is for sure; I am falling hard again. This time, there is someone there to catch me when I fall, even when it is in a subway and we are both standing ^^ Not another can take this away from me, unless he himself is God. Luck is what you make of it, not how you get through the day. Walking 2 hours home in -14 degrees celcius could do a lot to one... perhaps it put this fluff in my brain to begin with. I hate not driving, I hate that he is right and that I can't be right. I am so egotistcal and hard-headed. We flirt viciously. When I see him, I get nervous yet, I have enough confidence. I will not put him on a pedestal. He has flaws as all humans do, but he is good to me and that is as good as it gets. Monetary reasonings are insignificant to real love. It seems as though all people fight about is money. Instead of money, why don't people actually get caught up in the moment? It is actually nice to feel the warm embrace, to be in the nook (an SATC referance), to feel the soft embrace with lips so ripe, to gently run your hands over the person's face, to move the hair out of the face with the gentle warm embrace, to not give up so easily, to have fun and yet be able to be open and honest as possible, to be true to yourself, and to love. Do not doubt your abilities and yourself. I say if you want it, go for it."

That word is a hell of a horrible one. I know that for once, I am in the verge of doing that. I am with someone wonderful and real for once. Nobody can make me smile mischieviously and giggle as much. He came over for a movie. The movie was long but we had some distractions. LOL. WE had supper together, talked, enjoyed each other's company then went to a get together. It was pretty fun in general. It was awkward to meet his ex. I think she doesnt like me. Her handshake was pretty much more than firm as far as grip goes. I dont mean to sound conceited but I felt a little more secure when I met her. I wonder what she thinks. I shouldnt care because he is with me now. I know I shall forget in a day or two. What happend after the party was wonderful. We talked and cuddled like there was no tomorrow. Sometimes I wish I could freeze time and capture the moment. But in reality, we must live our lives until something is definate. That is the saddest part. How should I ever feel like really living like I did for the last 2 months when I leave him? Now, it is much more difficult to determine. Also, I don't want to think of my future to be quite frank. I hope he and I could take that trip together... Funny how its been less than 30 mins since I last encountered him and already I miss him... Oh no..."

Poetry corner:

To feel the warm embrace of my dreams, 
I must race to the end of the earth and back
To end sorrow 
Is to fear no pain tomorrow
I fear not death but fear itself.
Our weakness suceeds 
In our insecurities
No matter how great the deeds.
To love is to win 
Yet to win is to lose
One could never choose."

Went to see Scott St John play the Barber violin concerto with ""him"". Good concert. There was the Bruckner No 4 ""Romance"" symphony after the admission. We went around the Winspear and admired some of the art. Met his mom. Very nice. I look dorkey in glasses. He smiled. Something about him makes me melt. I think the evil, sadistic side of my heart is slowly thawing. Isn't that a miracle? I think God has a good plan for me this year. Let's hope so. I found someone I ""actually"" like. I hate the idea of leaving him if all goes accordingly to plan. I hate the fact that I am about to turn twenty soon and I want to know what lies ahead of me. Not knowing is so unbelieveably frustrating. Kind of makes one a bit crazy. I trust in God, yet, I keep having so many dark fears. Losing out is the main fear. I am not afraid of dying, yet, I am afraid of living. One thing is for sure: I want security. I have that very feeling when I am with ""him"". When he looks at me and smile, when we hold hands, hold each other and in general, when I am with him. It just seems like the fears go away for that moment. I want to live happily, if I live."

They have to deal with students' problem every stupid day. I had been fortunate when I ran into problems. God really helped me out but so did these people. I decided to write up a small note of thanks in the Christmas cards to a few teachers and staff. I saw only 2 people I wrote a Christmas card to. I gave one to the lady who really helped me out with moving out of McGill and Andre Roy our charismatic and young string chairman. Now, Mr. Roy and I haven't always get along, but he did after all answer my questions when I needed some help. I got a hug from the lady and a kiss on the left cheek from Andre Roy. ^.^V I guess our cold war is over. I do think that he deserves some acknowledgement. Especially because he works very hard and not hardly. I wanted to give more Christmas cards but none of the others were there...

I don't want to feel sorry for myself either. I'm just sick of life. I mean, what is the point? WHY am I here on this burden of pain and reality? Why does it feel like I walk alone? Is this really my destiny? It seems most musicians feel lonely in their own little way. I do not feel any profound connections with anyone. So tired.

Missed so many classes but it was worth it! I finally saw Curtis, got a lesson with Mr. Rosand, Ms Kavafian and saw 3 excellent concerts. Kuedos to the Phili Orchestra. My GOSH! The string section was amazing when I saw their Czech Night concert avec Sarah Chang. She is a conceited snob like always but she is surely an exciting violinist. She moves a lot though... like a tennis player. I thought Rosand was so amazing at this one concert I saw. I love his teaching, I love his playing... I want him as my teacher. I hope that will happen for me. Curtis students are amazing. Their orchestra sounds like a group of soloists. No jokes! So much more exciting than an ordinary university orchestra. Omigosh, this one cellist... WOW.... WOW... WOW...(heart beats faster). I also got to try the Moenig Guadignini... SO EXCITING! A million dollar fiddle. I can definately die super happy now, only I wont. Thank you GOD for leading me in a more exciting direction. I truly had the time of my life. I also feel more content. I love music, I love violin and I will improve! I will make QUALITY music and only settle for nothing but the best. I don't give. Also would like to thank my parents for making this happen. I dont want to stay at mcgill anymore. I shant. I shall go somewhere where music is the most extraordinary subject. McGill just isnt as exciting.

"event","Exhilarated, exhausted and ex-ed out!

As some of you may know, I have volunteered for three events: Discover McGill, Faculty Frosh and 4 Floors Party. Let us review all three;

Discover McGill: Snotty little bratty children whom I feel like throwing out of the window (suprisingly from other faculties, not music). My group was super duper special. I met like 3 koreans who were *gasp* not a FOB. Thank goodness! I liked my group actually. They were fairly well behaved and I felt so great just trying to guide them so they wouldn't freak out on their very first day of class. I would definately consider doing this again.

Faculty frosh: Great fun, exhausted and too many drunk leaders and Frosh Kids. I was fairly flirtatious. There is a difference between hitting on a frosh kid and going along with being naturally flirtations in order to make them feel comfortable. That is what I say in my defence. I did not break the rules and hook up with a froshie. I definately wanted to stop Phil from winning because he was being kind of obnoxious and I wanted to tell Dave a few things because he nearly got on my last nerve. It was really uncomfortable working with Dave. The first day, he was being awfully flirtatious. He danced with me like crazy because he was really drunk and I would refuse to touch him. I met Mark, an awesome, gorgeous, great personality, singer who was (I found out on the second night) Bi-sexual. Maybe I am not cut out for a relationship. I have never stepped out of the line and went towards the path of infidality, rather, I have perhaps created a situation in which there could have been some action. I DON'T hook up with random guys because I am not a whore. It felt good to Laser tag Dave so many times I scored off of him literally and placed Ninth. I still think he is awesome and so out of bounds. I must get a grasp of reality once more. Phil was being a perv and so was Ian and the rest of the frosh leaders. Even the girls. So I joined them. It was interesting. We would slap each other's hinnys and sit on each other's lap, dance with each other. I think there was more leader action going on than freshman action. I had many cool people in my group; Sophie, Avi, Kerin, Natalie, Mina, and etc etc, I dont remember all of them ^^*. Avi's friend James got super drunk and he sat on my lap which killed me the next day and made me sit on his. He then had me literally as an arm support so he wouldnt stumble while he took his drunk body back to his horribly far and painful residence. Eli kept on spinning me. He looked like Frodo so Juice, Claire and I gave him that name :P I thought he was incredibly cute as well. Dave kept on attacking me randomly. He drew Frankie the penis on his shirt. I think he has big issues. Anyways, the outcome was that I was incredibly sore after Frosh so I may re-consider ever being a leader. I LOVED the Kareoke part and wished I did solo. IT is hard being the only sober person, yet humourous because you witness people acting funny. I scored and awesome tierra from Mike the queen of MUSA frosh and a possibly great new gay best friend. Those are always great to have around.

4 Floors: I thought it was the most crappiest event McGill has held in Shatner building. It wasn't fun volunteering at all because the guys would start hitting on you in a most threatening way (esp after they had a few drinks before hitting up 4 floors). There were some people who liked my treble/j cleff stamp and others who were disgustingly rude about the whole situation, as well as immature. My hand felt like falling off and I got rewarded with 3 drink tickets. I had a Rum and Coke and really did not feel like having more drinks. I gave Eli a ticket and some other random girl from RVC. Eli was thrilled. The girl was ungrateful. Whatever. I am so tired of partying. I think I am getting old. Drinking is no longer my scene and I am baby-sitting people who are older than I am as well as a year younger. I dont think I will ever volunteer for such a ridiculous event. 

So that is that for Freshman orientation.

Orchestra today was a pain in the ass. I like Mahler, esp Symphony No2. I think he was extremely talented as a composer and I felt bad that his family had no love. It shows in his music that he wasnt raised in a happy-go-lucky atmosphere. 

I am extremely happy to announce that I will be joining Syncro team and will be an exec for the CMC (classical music club). I will be promoting it so do join. I promise I will work hard to make it a most enjoyable experience for all the people who join. I will arrange a wine and cheese party and will definately promote more concerts."

has just come to a complete crumble. I knew I was in a lot of pain, but I didn't know it was that serious. I just had to make sure. I regret that I did because I knew deep down there was something wrong with me. I hate doctors. Why don't they just be bloody honest and call you when the results of an x-ray comes out? Why did I have to find out from my lawyer that I have cervical spinal damage? I threw up right after. After that, later in the evening I got some chocolate. I am so angry at life. At the person who rear-ended us 2 years ago. Why do I have to go through this shit? I don't deserve this. Don't I deserve to be happy for once? Am I being too melodramatic? Well, tough. Deal with it! Are you happy now? I bet you are. I don't care anymore. At least I'll get my wish and mom will outlive me. I hope so. I never want to see her die. She's the only person who hasn't really cut my heart into pieces. At least I won't die old . Maybe its the way it should be."

"event","Mad squabling, maliciously, annoying, compestuous reprimandations. This what the unbearable lady has been to me today. Key word: UNBEARABLE! I only have so little patience. I mean I got my Class 7 license. I finally got over my phoebia of taking control behind the wheel. It was a good day until the shit storm came. So what if I decided to stay home and rest after being dragged like a dog on her string? I am pretty sure I have the right to decide if or not I want to go to yoga or if I want to stay home and rest. Her pushy ways is pushing me to the edge. Her guest occupies her good side. Its funny how she didn't spare some benevolent behavior for me. Bluntly: I really don't give a shit if someone is visiting. She has no right to throw a fucking shit storm at me to realive her stress. If revenge were to be sweet it is the bitterness she will have to deal with after I am gone. I pray to God that I die first so I don't have to listen to the crap she pulls. I am so extremely angry that I don't know if I could be any more patient. Crazy bitch, don't act like a psycho just to make yourself feel better."

"event","I think I am starting to get really sick of going out in Montreal. Everytime I walk back,even if it is with Karlan or some female friend, I end up getting hit on by guys. They aren't even settle about it. One was like ""Love your flower"", fortunately he was at least less creepy and better looking. Others were like HEY! WANNA GO TO A PARTY? *yells address*, some played with my hair >.< yuck! I was going to kick them for doing so. I don't think I will be walking at night from Giannecarla's anymore... I feel so uncomfortable doing so. Especially when it is freezing cold and the guys are creepy beyond creepy. The bar was awful as well. There were these guys playing pool and they started to come on to us. I mean just because we were waiting for the pool table, didn't mean that we were into those losers. I mean, honestly, grow up and stop being an invalid! I am so fed up! Girls here are treated like objects and not humans. If we get pricked by a need do we not bleed? If you pull our hair hard enough, do we not cry? Geez!

Aside from the creepiness, I had fun. Finished finals. Happy with life. I am going to do Sibelius 3rd mov't recording soon. Yelin is going to accompany me. Yesterday was so practical. I got up early, Simon-Marc and I had a long conversation. Leyan called me, I do not know why. I mean he knows that I am over him right? I hope so. He always condescends. Just because he goes to Caltech, does not give him the right to do so. All university students are busy and all undergraduate studies are generalized. End of discussion. He always talks about himself everytime he calls. I mean it is great to hear his voice but honestly, he hasn't changed. Not a day mature even. He tells me that I am too childish, honestly, I would say that to him because he doesn't seem to think when he says irrational things or becomes really quick to judge based on what he sees rather than hearing people out first. I may not be a Harvard undergraduate student, however, I am in university and I know what it is like to be under a lot of pressure. Just because Canada ends early, does not mean we do not work as hard. In fact, I wish it was more spread out. We have to learn so much in so little time. I mean he should re-consider what he says. I finally confronted him. I am so sick of holding back with him. Enough is enough... He seems to think that its okay to make random statements. However, now he knows that he can be a little too much. I shouldn't talk about him anymore. I feel bad. He isn't a bad person. He just has very impaired judgement. It's like he has beer goggles on when he drives on the road. 

I am going to church in 3 hours. I dont know if I will like being back in Bethal when I get back to Edmonton. I really luv Simon. He is a great friend. I never feel awful or awkward with him. It is really funny but I am expecting something bad to happen with guys. Perhaps it is because a lot of them have disappointed me. It isn't my fault. You can never be too careful with the opposite gender. They tend to be sly and sneaky. I miss my mom. Her cooking especially. I keep on regergitating my food. I think I will die early because of the DAMNED caf. I mean the stuff they serve isn't food. It is simply waste that they disguise as food. No nutritional value whatsoever and no enzymes that help you digest it. I am living proof. Enough said. I shall do something more practical now.

Oh ya! Be proud of me because I packed one box, practiced and jogged! I also talked to Nori briefly. Hopefully IT wont be too disappointing meeting him. I am thinking of going to visit Giancarla in Japan when she studies abroad. She is crazy. I will miss her... I will also miss Akiko. She is awesome ^^"

However, it hurts to know that he wouldnt wait for me. I wasnt worth the time. He found another. Good for him. I wasnt that nice to him anyways. I hope we never see each other again. I am so tired... I also hope that I never see my past again or let it haunt me. I know what I did was right. She is good to him so she deserves his undivided attention. I am just a distraction. Not worth it. Especially when she can be there for him. I keep getting ulcers. I am so worried about our quartet. I hope that I never have to deal with this again. Life is so hard. Why cant I fight back? I want to so badly! I dont have the strength to though. I live with Carlos, the only one who can comfort me, emotionally. There is no one one can depend on other than God and himself/herself. I also pushed away another because I know that he was immorally unjust to his girl. I cannot date older men who will be slick just so that they can really ""score"". It's not me. I want to be the most perfect citizen I can be so that life in heaven will not be life on earth but rather eternal bliss and fulfillment. That is what I am aiming for. God, forgive me, for I do not know what I did. Please give me the wisdom, courage and strength to carry on. Thank you for letting me meet someone I could relate to. I pray that you watch out for him. I also pray that you cast away my sorrows and pain. I trust in you and I pray that you be with everyone I care about and love. Give them the same courage to move on and be strong. Thank you for giving me strength and courage today. Please give me the same for the rest of my life. Amen."

Coaching was good and I have high hopes and expectations of my group. I hope to improve on my syntax for Harmony... I suck. The assignments Madame Sabourin gives out are hard T.T If only we can get out of theory, life would be so much easier! So nervous about my final midterm tomorrow. I didn't practice much and therefore, I have a fear of getting a disappointing mark. I have been feeling better after changing my diet. eating right isn't always easy in a dormatory. I am obsessed with losing weight and determined. Not only because of my family's harsh judgement but also to benefit my health. I have gained some confidence in doing so and will continue in this long and harsh journey. I am so stressed. At this point in life, mine revolves around school. I wish that we knew who we would end up with. I don't understand why I want it so much. One is the loneliest number. 

Fall in montreal is absolutely breathingtaking. When September comes, I will probably be sad... My friend will go to Japan and experience Sakura~ I want to travel around asia and europe. Hopefully it will happen for me soon.

I am so glad there isnt a lot of school left. I cannot believe that my first year is already almost over! What an overwhelming year! My lesson is tomorrow. Hopefully Prof Roberts and I will have a good lesson. I am so glad I don't have orchestra..."

"event","Went to church this morning. Yesterday however, I felt depressed. I went out with Julia to Provigo and SAQ to cook a nice genuine Italian dinner. It was great. I gulped all my wine up because I have to go to the swimming pool. Big mistake... I felt a bit light headed. I got really depressed when I came back because I found out that Nori was going to go to Japan for an year. I haven't even met this guy. What is wrong with me? I wanted to cry, but the tears just didn't come. I want everyone to think everything is going well with me although it isn't because I don't want to look weak. Today, I ignored Jaehoon Obba. Probably because I felt depressed. I want to know whether or not I am good enough for anything. I don't ever want to feel so vulnerable and worthless/inferior to others."

"event","I have known nori for about a week now. I really enjoy having conversations with him. However, I don't know what I am getting myself into anymore. I like the guy. I really do, he called me today. I don't know if he calls because he feels we connect well and possibly thinks of persuing a relationship or if he calls to be sincere. I must be crazy!
We talked about all sorts of things such as traditional values and such. In fact, there are so many conversations on this computer that it is purely insane! I don't know if it will work out because it is long distance and because we have such different time tables. Also, he and I spend hours and hours talking to each other. I really like talking to him. But I can get also tired too... I wish I could get out of this power struggle... He and I talked about house wife and stuff like that. Korean customs in the home. I feel weird talking to him about this stuff. I don't know whether it is him thinking about that other girl he talks about with a friend he barely knows, me or because of me. I don't know if I wanna know. He also dedicated a background to me. how sweet is that? But this is so wrong! I saw his abs. He showed it to me... I guess I asked for proof. It was kind of weird to see. I feel so out of shape and insecure everytime he is there.

Enough about him! I went out with karlan again. I think that we will be good at being roommates to each other. I hope Elgin Place will work out for us. We ate Japanese food and Phat Thai for dinner. She treated me to a movie and I gave her some snacks. I hope that she and I will be able to become really good friends. We saw Eurotrip. It was really funny, perverted and weird. 

My violin lesson went really well! Richard Roberts gave me a lot of encouragement and he seemed to be impressed. I am so happy! He admired my hand form, the way my fingers are and almost everything about my playing! Isn't this exciting? I am so excited! You should be for me too!

Well, I had a very long day. Hope I do well in my next lesson. So sad reading week is over. Hope I do well in MUSP 131 midterms... the rest of it anyways."

"event","Yesterday, I was talking to Nori on the phone again. We had some interesting discussions on dating. I played violin for him. I wish I knew him. It is so weird that I feel I already know him and it is so crazy that we have so many similar situations. I am not talking to Adam because I don't want to lie to myself anymore. I don't have feelings for him and it was really fun to play mind games with this player but now, I am just exhausted. It is too overwhelming for me to talk to him now. All we do is talk about superficial things anyway. I would like to meet someone I really connect with. I hope that Nori and I won't get bored of each other. I don't usually go on the net to meet people. This is weird. He sounds harmless...I cannot believe that reading week is almost over. I dont want to go back to school and feel secluded from the world outside of RVC again... I want to live! Live freely to do whatever I want whenever without a given time frame. Time flies when you have fun. It is unfortunate but true... I want to express how I am truly feeling for someone but I am too much of a coward to do this and besides, GUYS really hate confrontation. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore and I don't want to feel hurt. I decided to just lose weight and focus on my career. I won't give up without a fight...BRING IT ON!

Today, Karlan and I went to see apartments. Hopefully it will work out for us. I want to get a really nice place and I don't know if it will happen... -_-I want it too..."

"event","It is such a gorgeous day! I began the morning wonderfully today! I cleaned my room, ate healthy and avoided a lot of carbs. I have decided to completely give up ice cream. 

I am influenced in this decision because of my parents who critiques me in the most painful and mean way possible. I wish I was able to take the good into their approach but it is really hard. 

I am going to the gym later on to work out or swim. Either or. Going to go out at 3 so will make this quick. 

Just recently, I started to talk about the person I love. I gave it a lot of thought. I know he isn't my soulmate. I wish I could stop loving him. He and I have nothing in common, he doesn't really seem to know what true love is. I can accept him for his flaws but he cannot accept mine. He doesn't know I want him to be truly happy and I let him go because love isn't selfish. Therefore, we are not meant to be. This is sad to talk about but I must. 

Also, I started to panick about my major. I don't know if I want to do violin performance anymore. I have started to neglect violin because of my injuries and because of the politics involved. In the mid 20th century, violin was not about who you know, what you look like. It was rather less superficial and was based on beauty and the way you play. I don't know if I could really make a difference by majoring in music. So frustrating...

Started talking to this really nice boy. It is strange how one can open up to a complete stranger and yet, not be able to talk about these things with other people. How awkward is that?"

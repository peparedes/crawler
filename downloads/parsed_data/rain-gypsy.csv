"event","So, my dad passed away on Sunday June 28th.&nbsp; We had the funeral on Friday July 3rd.
Today is my first day back at work in 2 weeks, and I have to say it feels so strange to be here!
There is still so much to take care of and deal with as far as my dad's stuff, and come to find out, all of my mom's stuff is still there as well.&nbsp; I guess he didn't want to deal with it at all, so once he emptied her clothes out of the closet that was it.&nbsp; He left it all for us.&nbsp; Kind of sad to stumble across all of her things since we thought that was behind us.
The good thing is that he is no longer suffering.&nbsp; And I do mean suffering, he was in excruciating pain, especially at the end, so I am relieved that he isn't hurting anymore.&nbsp; Also, he is with my mom and everyone that has gone before, so that's good.
I'm not sure what's next, but I think we're going to be quite busy sorting through everything for weeks and weeks!"

"event","I took the day off work yesterday because we had a family meeting at the hospital, with the doctors, to make some decisions about my dad.
Some decisions were smaller and easier to make, some not so much.
First we sat down for a Q&amp;A with the doctor so that we could make an &quot;informed&quot; decision.&nbsp; I say &quot;informed&quot;, but really, there is no way in medicine to say unequivocally if &quot;A&quot; then &quot;B&quot;, or in X number of days this will happen, or this won't happen...fact is there is always a chance of recovery, there is always a chance of dying, there is always a chance that the universe will throw you a curve ball, so...how do you decide whether or not to pull the plug?
Start by taking into account the person's wishes.&nbsp; My dad has a living will and has told us in no uncertain terms that he does not want to be kept alive by artificial means.&nbsp; But, (there's always a but isn't there?) since he is on dialysis, and has been for some time now, he is technically already being kept alive by artificial means.&nbsp; If he stops the dialysis he will only last a couple of weeks, if that.&nbsp; He has been talking about stopping lately.&nbsp; The problem now is that he is not mentally (or physically) able to make the decision himself, and while almost all of us agree about what needs to be done,&nbsp;not necessarily when, there is one very vocal optimist and one mostly optimist arguing to keep him alive for as long as possible.&nbsp; Hours and hours of this at the hospital!
In the end we decided, unanimously, that there will be no resuscitation and no ventilator.&nbsp; For now we will leave the feeding tube in and continue dialysis, but we will move him out of ICU into the regular hospital with the possibility of hospice.&nbsp; We are meeting again in a few days to evaluate the situation.&nbsp; I think this is the best we can do for now, but, it totally sucks!&nbsp; It's amazingly hard to make life or death decisions for someone else!&nbsp; I have a feeling that my dad will end up taking the decision out of our hands."

"event","<p>Thursday:&nbsp; Went to the hospital to see my dad after work.&nbsp; Fortunately my friend and roomie was there to keep me company (and to navigate through the hell they call construction in that area).&nbsp; One of my brothers was there as well, so we basically chatted while we watched my dad sleep.&nbsp; He is either sleeping because he's so doped up on painkillers, or awake and screaming in pain (he recently had back surgery).&nbsp; He has a strep infection that they can't get rid of because none of the antibiotics they've tried are working.&nbsp; He also had a heart attack on Friday, and they think he had a stroke as well.&nbsp; I've got to say, things are not looking good!</p><p>Friday:&nbsp; Got up early and started painting.&nbsp; Went out and chopped up tree limbs, mowed and trimmed the lawn, while the paint dried.&nbsp; Went inside and painted the second coat of green.&nbsp; Back outside to clean the garage.&nbsp; And by clean I mean we took every single thing out of the garage, swept and sprayed it out, put the metal shelves together and put everything back in.&nbsp; Then, back inside to paint the trim.&nbsp; Then did some housework.&nbsp; Hung out for a short time with friends, then painted the second coat of trim.&nbsp; It was a long, busy day!</p><p>Saturday:&nbsp; Got up early for no good reason.&nbsp; Cleaned some more, organised boxes etc..&nbsp; Then my brother and nephew, Apostate_1969 and Donky_Hokey, myself and my roomie went to pick up the heaviest computer desk I've had the pleasure of watching someone else carry!&nbsp; One of my coworkers bought a new place and let us have it for free, and I must say, it is really nice!&nbsp; It does take up a bit more space than we wanted, but it also provides quite a bit of extra storage space we didn't know we'd be getting.&nbsp; It looks great too, so we're happy with it!</p><p>Sunday:&nbsp; Got up early, again for no good reason.&nbsp; Cleaned some more.&nbsp; Sat down and actually got some pretty good worldbuilding done.&nbsp; We spoiled ourselves with lunch at Sizzler, then came home and made Rice Krispie treats to thank the fine folks who helped us move furniture on Saturday.&nbsp; Went to dinner at my brother's, then came home and started doing laundry.&nbsp; Managed to get a bit more writing in while working on the laundry before I had to stop and make my lunch for work on Monday.&nbsp; The laundry finally finished at about midnight, but didn't get folded and put away until this morning because my ass was ready for bed!</p><p>I need to go back to work to recover from my weekend!</p>"

"event","It really sucks when the phone rings at 2:38 am!&nbsp; After you get over the initial confusion of &quot;what the hell is that hideous noise?&quot;, find the noisy thing and pick it up, you still have to figure out what to do with it.&nbsp; Finally it registers that it's your brother calling, and if you push that little button thingy you can talk to him, but, do you really want to know why he's calling at this hour?&nbsp; The answer to that is probably not.

I answered the phone despite my misgivings.&nbsp; Turns out my dad was moved to the ICU in the middle of the night because he has an infection.&nbsp; The hospital called my brother and told him to start waking people up.&nbsp; We didn't need to run to the hospital, but we needed to be ready to run to the hospital.&nbsp; Yeah, try to get back to sleep after that!&nbsp; Okay, I did finally fall asleep, just in time for the alarm to wake me, followed by a second phone call letting me know that my dad was doing better.&nbsp; Still in the ICU, but better.&nbsp; I have a bad feeling about this.&nbsp; We've been in the hospital way to much lately!

So now, I'm at work, tired as hell, a little cranky, and a lot worried.&nbsp; If things get worse my brother will call me at work, and I've warned my supervisors that I might need to leave abruptly.&nbsp; Hopefully things won't get worse!"

"event","I make bath salts every holiday to give as gifts and to make a little extra holiday cash.

Several people have asked for the recipe, so I thought I'd go ahead and post it.

Basic Bath Salt

3 parts Epsom salts
1 part coarse sea salt
1 part rock sea salt

You can use any sea salt you like (or even none at all) but don't use table salt or regular rock salt.&nbsp; You can also add a handful of baking soda if you like a little fizz in your bath.

To this you can add any combination of essential oils.&nbsp; More or less oil to your liking.
After mixing the oils to my liking I add a couple drops of food coloring.&nbsp; When the color is evenly distributed you can be pretty sure that the oils are well mixed also.

Add a couple of spoons or a handful to your bath and enjoy!

Here are a couple of my favorites:

Eucalyptus

1 cup bath salt mix
4 drops eucalyptus essential oil
2 drops each rosemary, thyme, wintergreen essential oils

Lavender Mint

1 cup bath salt mix
4 drops lavender essential oil
2 drops spearmint essential oil"

"event","So yesterday (Monday) sucked!
Missed work to take the car in because I had a flat tire.&nbsp; Ended up buying 4 new tires and getting the car realigned (4 frigging hours and $525 later!).&nbsp; There is also a CV something blah blah blah that needs to be replaced, but I am doing that next payday.
Left the tire place and stopped for coffee.&nbsp; Noticed that the brake pedal was very...VERY tight and that the car stopped very quickly.&nbsp; Thought to myself &quot;it must be the 4 new tires and the realignment&quot;.&nbsp; Came out of coffee shop and could not back out!&nbsp; Crap!!!&nbsp; Checked parking brake, not engaged.&nbsp; Called the auto shop and asked WTF?!!!&nbsp; The first thing the guy asked me was &quot;is the parking brake on?&quot;.&nbsp; Jackass!&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; They sent a guy out.&nbsp; It looks like when they parked my car they had pulled the parking brake so hard that the wire got caught and the brake stayed engaged!
To top it all off my dad said he would put it on his credit card (what a relief) but, he had to go to dialysis so he gave the auto shop guy his info over the phone but when he ran it it didn't work!&nbsp; I had to pay anyway (crap again!).&nbsp; There goes the house payment!

Next, I am sitting in my house and I hear a strange sound like branches being dragged through my yard.&nbsp; I go outside to find my neighbor has cut another huge section out of the fence and he is dragging all these branches into my backyard (he had trimmed his trees).&nbsp; I'm all &quot;what's going on?&quot;&nbsp; He tells me that he is going to take care of them he just needed a place to chop them smaller.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; I told him he'd better take care of it soon.&nbsp; I don't need any more crap in my yard!&nbsp; Personally I think he didn't realize that I had taken the day off.
He then proceeded to &quot;help&quot; me with trimming my trees.&nbsp; This is something I am going to have to talk to him about, he seems to think he can come and go as he pleases on my property.&nbsp; This is going to be a problem!
More of a problem because on Friday he and his dad came over and hauled away the stairstepper full of wasps and 2 couches for me which was really nice.&nbsp; I appreciate the help but I think he's overstepping the boundaries here!

I am so glad that day is done!"

I need new tires for my car and I am nowhere close to being able to buy them!
It's damn hard right now for most of us!

My solution...

I think that starting immediately all politicians, congressmen, senators, governors, etc., need to have their salaries adjusted down to the level of the average American citizen!
Instead of voting themselves raises the American people should decide on whether or not they have earned a raise.
I would bet that if the people spending our hard earned dollars had to try to get by on less than two thousand dollars a month, they'd sure as shit find a way to improve the economy, lower taxes, etc..
I would also bet that if their salaries depended on us they'd work alot harder for us!

Make a huge pan of simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water boiled until the sugar dissolves).&nbsp; Infuse a cup of this with&nbsp;a buttload of fresh&nbsp;mint sprigs (throw them in until the syrup is minty).&nbsp; Put some mint leaves and sliced limes in a glass.&nbsp; Cover with syrup.&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeeze in some lime juice.&nbsp; Add rum (to taste).&nbsp; Stir.&nbsp; Add ice.&nbsp; Add club soda.&nbsp; Stir.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; Add more rum.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; Squeeze in some more lime juice.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; And so on until the glass is empty.&nbsp; Repeat.
Margarita:
Take a cup of the simple syrup (already made from the Mojita adventure).&nbsp; Add a cup of Rose's sweetened lime juice.&nbsp; Add a cup of Triple Sec.&nbsp; Add a cup of Sweet and Sour.&nbsp; Stir.&nbsp; Put some sliced limes in a glass.&nbsp; Cover with syrup.&nbsp; Add tequila.&nbsp; Add ice.&nbsp; Add cranberry juice.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; Squeeze in some lime juice.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; Add more tequila.&nbsp; Taste.&nbsp; Continue until the glass is empty.&nbsp; Repeat."

I was watching the news and drinking my morning coffee when all of a sudden my couch started shaking!&nbsp; I thought it was just the garbage truck until my wind chimes started tinkling and my couch started moving from side to side.&nbsp; My cats were looking at me with that ""WTF?!&nbsp; Should we run?"" expression...and it hit me...earthquake!
I'm very happy that my rickety little house didn't fall on me!
There have been a few aftershocks that I didn't feel...probably because I am now at work and it would take a lot more shaking to feel anything in this building!&nbsp; Hopefully there won't be anything more severe than we have already had today."

1. Leave me a comment saying anything random, likeyour favorite lyric to your current favorite song. Or your favoritekind of sandwich. Something random. Whatever you like. 
2. I respond by asking you five personal questions so I can get to know you better. 
3. You WILL (if you really wanna) update your LJ with the answers to the questions. 
4. You will (again, if you really wanna) include this explanation and offer to ask someone else in the post. 
5. When others comment asking to be asked, you will (one last time, if you really, REALLY wanna) ask them five questions. 

1. Why did you start smoking? 
The truthful answer is twofold. First: my highschool sweetie that I dated for 7 years told me if I ever cut my hair or smoked he'd break up with me...after our mutual breakup I cut my hair and soon after took up smoking. Second: it turned out that smoking was a surefire icebreaker. More than anything out there! How sad is that? 
2. How did you meet Steve? 
I met Steve when I started working at Barnes and Noble. Also where I first met Charlie and Jim. What a great choice that job was! 
3. Have you ever really wanted to marry someone? 
The short answer is yes. 
4. What do you really want to do for a job/career? 
Author. Artist. Dictator. 
5. Do you ever feel lonely? 
Occasionally. Usually it's when I miss someone who's no longer available...like my mom. I'm generally pretty content to be in my own space. Sometimes I really, really miss people...like friends who are far away...but I don't consider that to be loneliness."

"event","Wow! It's been too long since I wrote anything! 
Here's a quickie catch up. 
We finally got our upgrade at work (which works out to .63 more per hourish for me) but, yay anyway because every penny helps! 

I've been sick for the last few months. It started as a sinus infection, which got worse and worse and that led to a urinary tract infection from hell. That was great fun since the doc pulled out the big guns (because they found red and white blood cells in the urine) and gave me something really strong...which I turned out to be allergic to. After spending several days looking like Rocky Balboa after the fight the swelling finally went down. The second medicine didn't work at all. It was good ol' penicillin that finally did the trick. 
The sinus infection never really left (thanks to the wonderful smokey air we have here in Utah) but, it's eased a bit and I'm happy with that for now. 
I had to have a nerve conductivity test done because my arm kept falling asleep. I say it's a pinched nerve. After the test found nothing the doc tends to agree with me. I took a couple of courses of anti-inflammatory meds and that has helped alot! 

My dad fell getting out of the tub. Thank god my nephew was there and found him! He's currently in a facility getting physical therapy so he can walk. I may have to move in with him. This stuff is happening way to often! 

I finally got central air (and just in time)! Woohoo! I may have to get a second job just to pay for running it though...because now that I have it...I USE it!!! 

And...there is a dead cat in my crawlspace! Not one of mine! But I am physically unable to crawl in there and get it out...so there it sits! I'll have to bribe one of my wonderful friends to crawl in there and pull it out for me! 

I think that pretty much catches me up."

"event","I'm sitting on the couch with my feet up sipping my coffee and watching CSI New York with the kitties when all of a sudden I get that feeling of being watched...then both cats sit up and look at the doorway leading into the kitchen...ears pricked forward and alert.  TV gets muted...don't hear anything...but I can't help remember the night a few years ago when I was trying to get to sleep but every time I closed my eyes I felt someone sit on my bed!  The next morning I was telling my roomie about this and she got the strangest look on her face and said ""let me tell you what I saw last night"".  She proceeded to tell me that she saw a young man walk down the hall and through (yes THROUGH) my bedroom door.  So I'm wondering if my guest is back.  This is the guy that used to tease my friends by poking his head around the doorway when they watched tv and then pulling back as soon as they looked over!
I always check out what the cats are looking at because their senses are better than mine.  They know when someone is outside before I do.  It's a little unnerving however when there is nothing tangible to be setting them off!"

"event","So last week I pull into my driveway after another long day at work only to notice that my door is ajar...with a bigass crack in it!
You guessed it!  While I was away at work some jerks kicked my door in and robbed me!  I don't know what's worse...the expense of replacing the door, the loss of property, or the loss of security...the feeling of violation.  Someone I don't know was in my home...in MY BEDROOM...I run the gamut from sadness to rage and back again.
Fortunately the kids are fine if not a bit shaken (every loud noise outside scares them and big noises completely panic them!)  I think they'll be jumpy for awhile.  Poor babies!
Yet another reason I want my own island!"

Ask me 3 to 5 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want and I will answer them as honestly and completely as I can. Then, if you want to, go to your journal, copy and paste this, allowing your friends (including me) to ask you anything. IF you want to, no peer pressure.

Your comments may or may not be screened, depending on what you ask. Same with your answers."

I am soooooo tired of hearing about how Mel Gibson is such a bad person for his anti-sematic ""tirade"" to a cop!
First of all who hasn't made rude comments in the heat of the moment and regretted it later?  It's not like he was on stage at the Oscars or in some public forum...it was comments to a police officer who had just pulled him over!
Second I can't help but think if some average Joe off the street had made those same comments the officer would have just shrugged it off as another obnoxious drunk.
Third Mel has apologized repeatedly.  Forgive and forget people!
And last but not least...shouldn't we be MORE upset that Mr. Gibson was driving under the influence?

It's not cool to be making antisematic remarks but at least it's legal!  People are allowed to have an opinion...granted he probably should have chosen better circumstances in which to express himself but maybe he was provoked!  I don't know I wasn't there.  I just think we should be complaining about the DUI instead of the big mouth!"

"event","I was watching 60 minutes the other day and they had a story about an employer who fired people for smoking.  The employer gave his employees 15 months to quit smoking and then anyone who tested positive for nicotine would be fired.  Believe it or not this is perfectly legal.  Apparently there are companies all over the US that refuse to hire smokers.  The justification is that it lowers their medical costs.  Personally I think it is just another excuse to A)pick on smokers and B)impose their own lifestyle preferences on another.  It makes me wonder where we'll be in 20 years.  Your employer can determine what you eat (no fatties allowed), what you drink (no coffee, tea or alcohol please), what you do in your spare time (exercise every day...no couch potatoes here) and probably who you sleep with (we all know where that's going).  It stuns me that a person can be fired for doing something legal on their own time.  According to the 60 Minutes story ""under the law in all but five states in America, your boss can fire you for any reason under the sun.  Including who you associate with after work.  Whether you're smoking or drinking in your own home.  Or a bumper sticker on your car.  And you have no legal recourse.""
I don't smoke anymore, but I do other things that could be considered unhealthy and it would totally piss me off if my boss tried to make me stop doing any of them!
Well, nuff said for now."

"event","I have a recurring dream...well the stuff that happens isn't always the same...but it's about the same place.  I dream about a house in the mountains.  It's always the same house.  The road is always the same.  The neighborhood (as far as you can call it a neighborhood) is the same.  I'm always there with 1 or more of my circle of friends.  It is always night.  There is always some kind of stormy weather, either rain, or snow, last night it was hail.  There is always wind blowing.  In last night's installment I was with a couple of friends at a picnic area (yes, at night).  We were BBQing and it started to hail so we were huddled under a tree.  The wind started picking up so we made a dash through the woods for the car.  We were running along this dirt path dodging hailstones and tree bits (the moon was out so we could see pretty good).  We finally made it to the car and started driving down the road and this is where it's always the same.  I'm in a car with someone on this same road and at the same bend in the road I wake up.  Every time.
I haven't figured out what it means, if anything.  It's so familiar to me though.  I recognize the place and it doesn't seem familiar just from my dreams, it's familiar from my memories."

"event","Evil is a matter of perspective.
I made this comment to a coworker and immediately another coworker jumped in with ""What about Hitler?"".  Aaargh!  The frustration of being asked for my point of view to defend a comment about perspective.  Duh!
It all stems from an RPG adventure many years ago in which half of the players were aligned with the ""bad"" guys and half were aligned with the ""good"" guys.  We spent a lot of time trying to convince each other that ours was the side to be on.  My friend and I would talk about it after each gaming session (often at work) and had pretty much the same experience with everyone (outside of our gaming group) in that they would bring up the most vile person they could think of to convince us that our opinion was in error.
I think that everything is a matter of perspective and it's actually quite difficult to really understand another person's point of view simply because our thinking is always colored by our own perspective.
Had to get it out of my system because I just spent an hour listening to my coworkers argue about how to do a new task and a lot of the argument consisted of ""I know but..."", ""but we need this because..."" etc., etc..  Everyone was only thinking about what they had to do and nobody was looking at the whole picture.  So of course it got me thinking about the old perspective discussion!

a) Tell you why I friended you.
b) Associate you with something -- a fandom, song, colour, photo, etc.
c) Tell you something I like about you.
d) Tell you a memory I have of you.
e) Ask you something I've wanted to know about you.
f) Tell you my favourite userpic from your list.
g) In return, you need to post this on your own journal

BUT....since I've been away from LJ in so long, also please tell me your tower name and/or your RL name so I can actually pull up memories about you. :P

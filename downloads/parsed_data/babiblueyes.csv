"event","This is gonna be a long post. Just like all of my posts, Lol. I don't do LJ cuts. If you don't like it- I apologize, you may un-friend me now, If you wish. :o)

Hey so yeah I never reply in here anymore. I went shopping a while back and got some pretty Easter clothes and I wore my Easter dress, well, on Easter. But I got another one thats SO pretty so I was gonna wear it this past Sunday but I didn't go to church- way too tired. I've been feeling better- but not all the way, ya know? Hrm. Well, I dunno. 

Roy left me, went to Oklahoma. But he'll be home tomorrow. He left me almost 2 weeks ago. :o( Thats a long time to be apart for us, ya know? So Hrm. 

Well, Like, there's about 1,000,000,000 things that I could write in here since it's been so long since I have. But yeah well, I won't. Haha. I mean no way I can remember it all anways, right? Well prom is coming up. I got my dress!!! Its beautiful. and TIGHT. Lol I think i'm gonna get the corset thingy taken out of it, it won't be so tight then. I got my 2 other dresses for the Fashion Show too. 

Prom Dress - http://www.cybernetplaza.com/page.asp?style=c2262  Its strapless tho
Fashion show Dress 1 - http://www.alfredangeloprom.com/index.cfm/fuseAction/COLLECTIONS.productDetail/fromAdvancedSearch/0/productID/0382100c-5554-42ec-92a7-67773aac2940/categoryID/c0322fdd-f6ea-4002-8c96-3ff25fba316a  Except its in red
Fashion Show Dress 2- http://www.alfredangeloprom.com/index.cfm/fuseAction/collections.displayDetailImages/productID/14c22df1-04e7-48cc-a115-712d5fceface

They all fit real good and I like 'em!!!

I dunno WHY I am even doing that fashion show- I'm scared to death, lol. People are gonna be gay and make fun of me and whatnot. Because well people are like that. The fact that I'll probably fall on my face won't help much though. Haha.. Ermm...

I miss Roy.. like... LOTS! Yeah I do. But he loves me a lot and he misses me too and he wasnt unfaithful to me or anything so its all good. And yes I am 100% positive of all of those things.

I'm excited for prom, i hope he can go!!! If he doesn't have to work he can go. He got his paycheck today $1000+ how effin great is that???

Okay so at school. hrm I havent made it an entire week in well a LONG time. But I'm doing better than I was before. I'm getting hooked up with a 504 meeting thingy. Which basically means I have a medical condition that keeps me from attending school on a regular basis, please excuse me, bla. And Blah. So there. BUT first we have to get the diagnosis- which we're still waiting on!! And yeah Dr. Tash, from Pittsburgh, never called back with my test results, So Um. I guess I don't have lupus, right? Lmao. I would hope not. He tested me for some other things too, I'm sure they came back alright tho. 

I've been goin to physical therepy. And doin exercises in the pool. Mostly there's Travis. Sometimes Lauren, or Sarah that works with me. I prefer the ladies, because hello! I'm standing in a pool with some therepist watching me exercise- at least with a female I'd have SOMETHING to talk about! Hahaha Yeah its awkward when tehres nothin to talk about. But WOW my therepy is making me feel a lot better. Well, its challening and relaxing. It makes me feel like i'm not a lazy ass for the first time in a year, Lol. And also its helped me get out and do more things just around here, which I had a lot of trouble doing before. OH! btw- my BALANCE!!! Yeah, well if u know me, then you know that I have HORRIBLE balance! Lol and.. well cant even walk through my house without getting hurt basically. I have to balance on one of those floaty noodle things in the pool for 5 minutes, and also I do some of my exercises while sitting on a big beach ball in the water- and wow. My balance has improved a lot. We've bumped up my leg exercises with ankle weights, and I'm thinkin about bumpin up the noodle thing too. I dunno how they do that, but they said when I think I'm ready, to tell them so they can advance me. Dr. Martin says that next month I can go out into the front room and do floor exercises with the machines and what not to build up some more strength and stuff like that. 

Um OH the little girl that plays Ally on the Everybody loves Raymond is sooo pretty!!
And speaking of pretty little girls- I miss my niece Kyra sooooo much!!!!

March 31 I went to a Maroon 5 concert!!!!!! WHOOOH!!!!! Me and Miranda and Meredith and Kari. It was great!!!! Great plus five. Yes'm. So yeah we were fifth row- not floor seats, but the stadium seats right beside floor- beside, not behind. So. Um. Yeah we had real good seats. Well actually whoever was sittin on the very end, wouldnt have been able to see, so we scooted down and had great seats then! Lol Some people came to get their seats, but saw that they were taken, so they just left. So- cool- we got good seats and stuff. And M5 and the Donnas were both very exciting and performed a wonderful live show. They had a day off the night before, and the Donnas went out to some Motown bars and got pretty wasted, Lol. And yeah, so. Mickey, the bassist, my favorite, he was on the opposite side of the stage that I was sitting at- so I didnt have a great view of him. Good view of everyone else though. Including Ryan who- WTH- was like backstage and there was some guy, Matt? as a replacement drummer... But O well. We were also right beside the big projector screen thingy, so we had a good view of everyone afterall.

j76  hghhbn <--- Silas says hi.

He's been here like A LOT lately. Pretty much everyday. I dunno why, but I love him and well he's like my little best friend :o)

We got his 6 months pictures back! AWWWWWW I Loooooooooove him soooooooooooo much. He's so beautiful and perfect. I swear, he's an angel. And sometimes when he's sleeping I think he really is an angel.

My mom is taking him for a walk outside right now :o) Yeah its been beautiful out lately! And its not supposed to rain for a few days

This past Saturday I went and took my ACTs...... UGH! Yeah. Ok that sucked REAL BAD. I had to sit there for so many hours lol it was so boring- filling in bubble after bubble. Then I had to take the writing essay thingy too. And Man I was on a roll with it, then I hear '5 more minutes' Ohhhh :o( Yeah so I hope I did okay on it. I'd like at least a 24!!! Please!!!!

Ummmmmmmm. I need to go TAN!!!! I've been tanning and doin good but I need to go tonight, I was gonna go ealier but I had to watch Silas.  So I'll go later. It would be nice if I could go SOONER rather than later, so I can get home, take a shower and whatnot and get to bed at a decent time.

I have to be in Charleston at 11:30 tomorrow night to pick up Roy from the airport. AHHH!! I CAN'T WAIT!! I miss him. Lots. Heh :o)
<3

Omg Silas has this blue hat on and it looks sooooo good with his eyes!! I love him, Truely, I do! So tomorrow also I want to go to therepy (I havent gone all week bc the pool has been broke)and then I want to go to tan and then come home, get a shower and go get Roy!!!! Well, do that after school... I hope i can get it all done!! I get exhausted real easy still, and I'm trying to do better and get back to my old self. Sometimes I overdo it but I'm workin on it.

There was tons more I was thinkin about puttin in here........ But Alas, I need to go get something done.

<3

Oh yeah. Like... lol before Spring break even, Steph Kelly decided that she didn't like Kari so she waited until everyone was in the lunch room and Kari was standing beside a teacher, and she walks up to dumps a bunch of Pizza sauce in Kari's hair. LMAO. sooooooo of course!!!! that = drama drama drama, Lol

K. I'm done for real this time.

"event","*yawn* Okay so I haven't updated in like. Forever!!!

I never told the story about Jason and Jena.

Abby stayed the night. The next day they had church. Then Abby had gymnastics. Then there was a bow shoot in Buchannon. Well after church they RUSHED home, changed clothes, RAN Abby to Gym real quick. Well here's where it starts.

Jason and Roy were prepared to leave Abby there and then her mom was gonna pick her up after practice. Well Jena thought that they were gonna take Abby home and THEN go to the bow shoot. Ya right! Wtf? Go to Doddridge Co. then clear to Buchannon? UH.. ya.. How about ""NO"" They'd completely miss the bow shoot if they did that. Okay so anyways it was a huge misunderstanding, Right? Well Jena got mad. And she was all 'bla bla i dont feel good i want go home NOW' So they got in a HUGE fight and Jason was like ""Well you're a woman and you never listen"" And then it was *SLAP* She slapped him for saying that!!! Roy said he had a HUGE red mark on his face. I can't believe she HIT HIM!! WTF? 

Okay so then she starts off running her mouth about stuff taht she has no clue. Like ""No, YOU never listen and you're just like your dad, thats why your mom divorced him!""....... Okay... Steve wasn't a bad husband or a bad father at all. My mom didn't divorce him b/c he didnt' listen. She divorced him b/c he had a BAD drinking problem and it basically took over his life, and sadly he chose alcohol over his family. Jena has no clue of anything of Jason's dad. She needs not to go there, the man's been dead for like 10 years. Thats a touchy subject for Jason- he never knew his dad really.

So then Jason stopped at a gas station to get money out of the ATM and he was gonna take her home and everything. Roy said she was like ""I'm leaving him"" and started the truck! Roy said he got out b/c he didn't want to be with her! (I don't blame him!!!) And she just left. She left them at the gas station in Quiet Dell. Without their bows. Or anything! SHe took JASON'S Truck. Not hers. Even tho she thinks its hers. (UGH!!!)

She comes FLYING in the driveway around 1:00pm and here I am, clueless of everything.
We were watching Silas while they went to the shoot. My dad was feeding Silas, and he'd just fallen asleep. My mom went to FoodLion to get something for lunch and somewhere to buy Silas a coat so we could go for a walk outside with him. He didn't have a coat and it was kinda chilly. But NO! Jena storms in our house, tracked muddy shoe prints throughout it (Like ALWAYS, LMAO) and then snatched Silas from my dad's arms and woke him up :( He started crying and everything. So then she was like ""We gotta go"" and just left. I told Abby to come here and she told me what happened. I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EFFING PISSED OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO PISSED!!!!!!!!!!! I got sick to my stomach, I was shaking. I swear if she wasn't bigger than me, OOOH!!! I couldn't even speak to her. I just stared and she wouldn't look at me! 

Afer she went outside I told my dad to go ask her where Jason was. So he did. She said she was going to stay at her mom's. My dad left to go get Jason and Roy. I looked up the 7-11's # in the book and called them to tell them he was on the way. Jason was too embarassed to call for a ride. Isn't that sad? And later when we were talking about her he got upset b/c she's 'his wife' BLAH. Well anyways. I guess before Jena left, she at least had the decency to leave the bows at the house. But it was way too late by then to go to the shoot. Jason came home and then went to work, b/c he didn't have a vehicle and there was nothing else for him to do. He was SO upset. I bet he cried! ROY WAS PISSED! Everyone was. That girl was SO effin lucky that my mom wasn't home until later b/c maaaaaaaan. When she got home she WENT OFF. She went CRAZY. Yeah. She was definitely very very very very angry. Very upset. Bad. I don't blame her. Thats her son and grandson.

Jason called us that night to tell us that everything was okay and HE APOLOGIZED. WTH? We told him he didn't have anything to be sorry for. But you know how he is.

Okay so thats that.

She hasn't mentioned it since. (Thank GOD! I think my mom's blood would boil if she did mention it)

----

Then we kept Silas the whole next weekend!!! YES!. Alright. Friday morning Jason and Jena left for Gatlinburg! It was their 1 year anniversary, so they made it a Honeymoon since they never got one. (She didn't want it to be a honeymoon, though she wanted lots of people to come. Isn't she weird?!?!?!?!!!) So anyways. They left and had fun. HOw can you not have fun in GALINBURG?? its great down there! I'd love to go back. But not for someone else's honeymoon. And not without a lot of money- haha!

So. I came home from school and Silas was there! And Roy! And then me and Roy went and got our CELL PHONES!!! 629-4183 (me) 629-4253 (roy) and then Nick came over. Then Roy and Nick went out that night and Me and my mom spent time with SILAS!!! I swear I love him to death!! He's the best! lOl Then the next day me and roy and nick went to Motown to some hunting thingy it was cool!!! I got to see my first real life, up close, stuffed moose!!! I want one sooooo baaaad

---- Woah i'm watching National Geo. Channel. these people are on the way to the hospital b/c this lady is in labor- and BOOM there's a tornado!! Lol Crazy!! -----


Okay so back to the story.

Thats about it basically. I mean I could take up 40 pages of just Silas. I LOVE HIM!!



Roy got a job! Yay!! $10/hour YES!!

I went shopping today and oooooooooh I got SO many cute springy things!!!

I'm tired.

I started physical therepy, by the way. I LOVE IT! Its sooooooo relaxing. I do water aerobics in the hot pool. Ommmg I hate getting out of that pool. Its so nice and relaxing. And for once, in a LONG time, I don't feel lazy and worthless. I feel like maybe if I don't jiggle when I walk, I'll feel better. Dr. Tash basically told me there's nothing he can do. What do you do when Doctors tell you there is nothing you can do? What a horrible thing to hear. I don't have cancer- it could be worse. But geeeeez. This SUCKS. I have to admit. I guess that means that I exercise, go to therepy, try my best to get sleep, and force myself to do as much as I possibly can. I force myself to go to school- I can't miss much more. I try to keep positive and a good mindset always helps. :o)

I am tired!

I LOVE my Roy James w. All My [heart] !!!!!"

"event","Hi. I've been going to school more often, though I don't feel any better, but you must do what you must do. I force myself. Mr. Heaster told me that I don't try or put forth effort. I hope he chokes- not die though. Roy just got home and I'm not doing my homework. I didn't bring the right book home for English. And how do you write an essay on something that should actually just be a bulleted list? I would love to not have to have school tomorrow, but its not snowing much so I probably will. Unforuntately. Ha, look how I spelled that!
I went to Pittsburgh on Thursday. Dr. Tash said .............. well nothing that I particularly wanted to hear. He didn't bother checking for Fibro. He didn't even look at the pressure points. He said something like 'You have Fibromyalgia. So what? What do I do? There's no medicine to give you' He doing tests, they took 5 things of blood. They also told me I only weigh 114 which I don't think is true, Lol, but hey! Thanks. He's sending me to physical therepy in Bridgeport. I have to lie in warm pools to relax my muscles and do 'pain desensitizing' exercises. Also, I need to get into a regular exercise routine, but I didn't need to drive 2 hours to have a doctor tell me that. Lol Dr. Tash checked all my joints and stuff. He's a dr. for juvenile rhumatoid arthritus, and I don't have that, sooo..... Yeah. Lol

I'm very tired and I suppose I'll have to go to school tomorrow since its barely snowing, and the snow we're getting, is more like rain. *stomach drops* I need to do my homework, but I'd rather sleep so I can at least show my face at school. They don't understand that I would be able to perform a lot better if I could get my rest and then just make up the work. I always make it up and everything. On time, usually too. But being there- having to get up and get ready and go all day long- I can't do that. its not just school, its out to the mall with my friends, its to the bow shop, to church.. I can't do those things normally. i dont enjoy having to schedule my life around being sick. When I go to school I can't concentrate, I'm just miserable. I usually don't get much accomplished.

I've been going to the bow shop every night (except tonight) I'm getting better. I'm really not bad. I love it- its addicting.

Roy's gonna get a job soon. And i'm gonna get a cell phone.

Yesterday there was a bow shoot in Buchannon. Jason, jena, and Roy were goin. They left after church to go to it.  And its a long story and I'm tired so i'm gonna go to bed. I'll tell you later.
<3."

"event","Hey everyone. Here I am.

*dances*

*yawn*

What exactly is Constantine about?? I know it has something to do with a 'Neo-esque' guy who's been to hell and back. But... I dunno. I wanna read some reviews.

So I'm watching Seinfield now. Who doesn't love that? There's a game tonight at Notre Dame. And I guess James Douglass has been bugging Meredith and Miranda, lmao. I hear he's a complete ego-trip (ew) He was like 'sorry, for scoring so much.' !!!WHAT!!! Hahaha, who actually says that?! OH, thats funny. But anyways, I'm not going to the game tonight, b/c I've got some math to do. Not that it would take way long or anything. I just kinda wanna hang out here with my mom; she's been SOO stressed lately.

There's a like 2 or 3 lights burnt out around here. Hrm? Lights don't last very well.

So me and Roy watched: Shark Tale, Taxi, and Mr. 3000 over the weekend. They were good! Shark Tale was the best!! Taxi was ok and Mr. 3000 was ok.. 

OK on TBS, they have these little quizes during commercials, and they always have the same one
Q: What is shrinkage?
A: Something that happens to George in the water
Like, everyday they have the same one. How old does that get? Old.

Stephen better step it up. Tonight might be his last chance. Mandi deserves a good man! And she shall have one.

I've been lookin at WickedHotMakeup and Punk_makeup and some other makeup sites here on LJ and I've tiptoped into the waters of Xanga as well. Makeup: I want to learn how to blend!!! Online Journal: Is Xanga better than LJ? What about Myspace? Hrrrmmm.......

I want to do something different with my layout here. Also, no one reads this, I might put a link in my file, but then. Do I want people to read it? I'm not sure yet. I want to learn how to do LJ-cuts too, b/c I have NO idea. Lol I want to add pics and whatnot to my posts. But then. No one reads! Hahaha... Oh, funny.

I'm going to Pittsburgh on Thursday. Dr. 'Cash'... She's got some big, complicated name that I can't spell or pronounce and obviously I'm not the only one, b/c I was told to call her Dr. Cash. Its like Dr. Arkachasri. Yeah, I think thats right. Something like that. Well anyways, she's a rhumatologist. I hope she's good. I hope she finds out whats wrong with me and fixes it. I've basically lost most hope in doctors and their ability to do their job: diagnose and cure. Maybe she will be different. You know? Actually listen to me. And stuff. I really don't want to hurt anymore. Its just getting so old and.. I dont want to be miserable and in pain and miss out on normal kid-life things. My arms touching my side, my shoulder blades touching the back of the chair.. This shouldn't hurt so bad that it makes me sick to my stomach and want to cry........... SO yeah. Zach from drafting, Mr. Heaster said that he has RA and goes to a rhumatologist, so I'm gonna ask him about it tomorrow. Maybe he can offer some advice or something?

This is my prom dress

I love it :o) Its so unique- I don't think anyone else will have anything like it and I think it'll bring out my 'bloo' eyes!

This is the one that Jenna D says she wants!

My flirting skills...... Not true, not at all. What? Just because I have a boyfriend and haven't 'talked to' or dated any other guy in years, doesn't mean I've forgotten how to flirt! Lol


As for never getting laid in high school? Yeah. #1 I wouldn't want to get laid by anyone there. Ever. #2 Roy. That's all you've really got to say about that. Lol Its never going to happen, and I like it that way!

As for 56% of the people hating me? I've no clue of the truth to this. I don't know what the student body thinks of me at all, really. Lol

And yes. I do bite."

Loma (the lady at the front) called her down at the courthouse. So she told us to wait and we're here waiting. Roy's trying to stick a paper clip in my ear. We're goin over to Kelly's house later and she's gonna color my mom's hair and maybe cut Roy's-if he goes. He's not going to go if he doesn't behave himself!!!! Haha! Hi Mom. Mom's here now. She says hi. Roy farted in my mom's chair so that when we leave, the smell will stay and everyone will think that she is really stinky.  Haha, only joking. It faded quickly- Thank God!!! What a stinky, turd-head that boy is. But I love him, I do. Okay well I'm gonna go now because I think we're gonna go get something to eat. Cya

"event","I just got back from the b-ball game. We lost, but who cares. I dont even know where the team was from that we played. Well, I guess Mandi cares that we lost b/c she has to put up with Steven being pissed off- BAD. Yeah I dun even know why I called her that- I haven't in like. Forever.. Since like the begining of the school year. Or summer or something. It just kinda faded, the nickname did.

Ty was at the game. He's nice to me- he's done me wrong tho in the past. And God knows he's done Roy wrong. He said that ""90% of the time"" when they went to play poker, they played poker. But a couple times they did go to strip clubs. He said Roy didn't cheat on me there though.

BUT. Roy lied to me. About the cards/strip club deal. And he used MY MOM'S MONEY FOR STRIPPERS!!! Omg.... BAD! very bad

So there it is. Well I have cramps and I'm out of shape so guess what I'm gonna do? Get my ass firm. Time to exercise.

"event","i hate guys. i am officially lesbian from now until whenever i declare myself straight again


Ok? So there motherfu.. *sigh*

Heres the deal

I'd rather peel the flesh off my body and jump into a pool of boiling alcohol than be in this situation.

First of all, I hate Daniel Hayhurst and I hope that Roy never hangs around him again. WTF is wrong with Ryan and Nick and Me?!?! Huh? Why does he have to setlle for dumbass low life losers like Daniel and Ty Garcia? I hate those guys.. Man! I like Ryan, he's nice.... I think Nick would be a better friend to Roy- but then perhaps that is because Roy would choose to be a better friend to Nick and Ryan. If that made any sense.. Okay so maybe this way: Ryan sometimes seems like maybe he thinks hes better than others? And Nick hasn't done anything to get on my bad list.. so far. No one's perfect. My friends aren't. Why should his be? They shouldn't. But they dont have to be SCUM! OMG I'd rather he hang out with ANDY SPITLER than those guys!! And Andy's like....... not got the best reputation. But who cares about reputation? Has Andy ever done HALF the horrible things to Roy.. AND ME.. that Daniel.. or Ty for that matter, has done?? No!

I could list so many ways that those guys have screwed Roy over.. But he keeps them around. Just in case, Just in case he's bored one day- so he won't have to be alone and he can have someone to go someplace with.. Ok. NOT worth it.

Well Ladies and gentlemen, I grew balls tonight. I'm a woman and I now have balls. They're bigger than I ever would have imagined. I did and said things I never thought I would- to people I never thought I would. And I controlled my anger. Which was surprising (thank GOD for prozac or Daniel might be in the hospital) I feel EXHAUSTED. Absolutely wiped out. Mentally, EMOTIONALLY, and physically. *sigh* I keep doing that. It feels good- like the more I do it- the deeper I breathe- the more the bad things go out. I used to cut myself. Because I was so numb. I was emotionally numb- 100% And it was a way to feel -alive- but I dont do that now. I stopped. For Roy. Now I sigh? Haha! I'm going to pray and pray and pray and pray and pray and pray and pray. Oh, Lord help me with this situation please!!!!!!!

The accusations that were made against Roy are as follows:

Daniel- said that instead of playing poker Roy goes to titty bars
-said Roy has cheated on me repeatedly
-slept with 4 girls at Glenville
-said Roy got blowjob at bar- in public

Rob- said he heard that Roy slept with ""Mary""

The Facts:

Rob- said he asked Roy about Mary and he said no. says he doesnt think Roy did
-says he's seen girls in the room with Roy but that they weren't doing anything
- no titty bars at Glenville

Ryan- says he knows Roy loves me. says they talk about it a lot.
- honestly doesn't think Roy would do that to me

Nick- said he knows Roy did not sleep with Mary
- doesnt know for sure about the other girls
- doesnt think Roy would do that to me
- says Roy loves me
- said it seems that to Roy, I'm ""everything to him""
- said maybe Daniel just wants me


So. I need a jury. We need a trial. I need a punching bag and some valium. I love Roy. I know Roy loves me.

And Ahem. Excuse me, for being.. Conceited. Why would anyone need to go elsewhere to get something- if they've got the Very Best right at home? Hm? You tell me that.

I rest my case I need to vomit and pass out"

"event","Hi *waves* and Merry Christmas!!!

Not that anyone every actually reads this.. because well, also, I never actually update. Lol

Ahh......... Update......... Hrm. I've been going to school- missing a LOT. I guess, I dunno.

My health= frustrating. I just want to be a normal kid I'm tired of hurtning and always being exhausted, but I usually dont let it get me down. :o) Sometimes its hard though...

Roy's living with me now, don't know if i mentioned that. He's not at Glenville b/c he was really unhappy there. Sometimes its awkward, him living with me. But for the most part, I really like it. Teehee, sometimes he's so demanding though! haha Its like just because he's sitting there and i'm in the next room, when he says ""Hey, Come here.."" I should do it like right then- Lol its funny.. he's not mean about it, just super impatient- He's always been like that though, but I'm noticing it more. My mom says its like we're already married. Kevin Fury asked me if Roy and I were gonna get married- I told him yes. I would like that very much so... Secretly, all I've ever wanted is to fall in love and get married before I'm like 21... And have babies and stay home and clean the house and fun wife stuff like that!!! Lol.. Wow, that was completely beyond cheesey. But its okay. I just told my secret to everyone- or no one since no one reads this :o)

He was gonna start a heavy machinery school last month, but then he got a wicked job offer. Well he put the school on hold for the job ($12 an hour, hello!) Lol... but.. he ended up not getting it, b/c the other guy had 4 years of experience. So now on January 4th he starts a truck driving school. He's gonna get his CDL. I think he'll really enjoy that, and I want him to be happy.

OKay so COME ON ALREADY! Lets get to the obvious!!!! Tomorrow is CHRISTMAS! I cannot wait.. its not so much that I want to get toys and fun stuff like that, lol.. Its like it almost doesnt matter whats in the boxes, I just wanna open them!!! What people say is true, Christmas does change as you get older.. Its like I'm more excited about seeing my mom's reaction to what I got her than I am about if I got a new digi cam or not... But yeah I'm not dead or totally weird. So of course I'm still thinking 'I wonder if I got my camera' In the back of my head... Teehee

Man my posts are always so long and I dont do LJ cuts. Why? Because its my journal and I don't have to.

Leah got me somethin- I bet its nice- I get it on sunday when she comes over!!

Oh yeah! I got a new bow for my b-day.. A Browning Micro Adrenaline.
Roy went to pull it back and then string broke and came back and hit him in the head and cut him realllly bad. It bled for like 2 days. But he's ok now and so is my bow :o)

I got to see Kyra <3 OH I missed her SO bad! I love her to death!!!!! And I LOVE SILAS HUNTER too!!! 

Jason and Jena and the baby are comin over tomorrow morning in their PJs to open presents with us. I love that Roy is here with us.. I know that ya know its weird cause we live with my parents and stuff.. But its really not so bad. I love him!

K. I'm gonna go now..

"event","HEY! Alrighty. Ha. I lied about the music that I'm listening to. But That song is a real good song and I wish I had to b/c I'd listen to it. Haha

Alrighty so I love Roy w. all my heart- but he's not going to be able to go to Ohio this weekend and he's gonna be really upset- and its not my fault!! :o( Grrr...


Oh yeah! By the way, homecoming was pretty cool. I went out to dinner with a whole crew of people (Leah was my date by the way, and we were super hott) We went to Texas Roadhouse- which it was Leah's first time ever there. Sean Langley was with us and he tossed and entire bucket of peanuts across the room... Bucket and all.. Right in front of the manager guy. What a douche- haha And all of us girls looked real pretty and stuff and we danced and had fun. I danced with some foreign kid. His name is Tony and he's from China- he doesn't speak very good english though. He's got the chicken pox now which has to suck!!! Haha. Wow I'm glad that I've already had them b/c the pox are goin around school real bad, I guess. Which is totally weird, I think. 

Eminem's new song makes me laugh- He giggles like PeeWeeHerman and Michael needs to leave him be. Lol 

OKay. Homecoming. Alrighty. Ummmm... Stephanie grinded with James Brite. . . . NO Comment. None, whatsoever. Hahaha. WOW! Eliza went with Perry and then he took off with Kari- Kari's date, Jason took off with Stephanie. Which was cool b/c everyone won, I guess. Except Eliza which sucked for her. :o( She needs a good man. She's liking this Sean kid now. He better treat her right. Thats all I gotta say.

Umm.. Meredith wrote me an apology letter, which was nice. They didn't go to Fright Farm last weekend. And by the way, there was abosolutely NO way that I would have gone with them. But they're going this Saturday now and I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna go with them now.. Lol Girl drama, what can I say?

Shepard's College tour thingy.. Um. Yeah 3 1/3 hours on a bus with loud people. Quick lunch. Long waiting time after lunch = boring. 2 hour tour with lots of walking and a totally annoying gay guy. Hahaha. Then back to the bus and a 4 hour ride home. There was traffic. Plus we had to stop to eat, also. So yeah. By the way, the dorms there are real small. The one that they showed us, is like half of the size of Roy's. Which I thought was strange so I said 'Wow, theses are small dorms' And the guy goes 'This is one of the bigger ones' :-O whoa.

Tonight I'm going to College Night at the mall with Miranda and Leah (Miranda just called by the way, but she didn't leave a message so I'll just wait and call her back when I'm done) And we're gonna shop and what not. And sign up for some awesome door prizes and Scholarships. Should be alright.

Today is Jason's B-day. He's 27!! I can't believe he's like.. almost 30! Thats crazy.... In December, I'll be almost 20! Hahaha! 

Tomorrow we're FINALLY going down to Charleston to get these army medical card thingys. My dad has been trying to get my mom and me to go... forever!! And we just havent had time, ya know? But we're going. Plus I'm gonna go try for my permit tomorrow too!!!!! Wish my LUCK!!!!!!! I hope that I get it, because that would make Roy really happy. I personally, would probably be pretty happy too, I guess. Lol


Report Card

Biology   B
ACT Prep  A
Applied Geometry  B
Computer Drafting A
General Drafting B

Pretty good, Huh? Roy says I should have gotten all A's but what I made was really good, so poo on him! haha

Ahhhhhhh.. Alrighty welp. I shall talk to you later."

I'm watching a cartoon about Lions and they have Sigfried and Roy as cartoons and its really funny... Its so funny, I mean Roy (not my roy) doesnt even have scars on his neck. Its so weird... The lions kinda creep me out though...

SO!!!!! This past weekend = amazing.

Friday was so fun. Roy James came home and we went to the football game. Me and Roy and Miranda and Leah sat together it was awesome (the others were off getting high- we'll get into that later)

*BREAKTHROUGH*
Extra wildberry gum commercials = the best. Omg.. Its a Scottish stick of gum. Whats better than that????


OKay.. so anyways the football game was 30-30 and there was 2 seconds left and then we kicked a field goal! and won 33-30 hoorah!! :o)

Friday night I vaughely remember Roy coming into my room late at night with something orange in his hand... Then I wake up and look on my dresser- :oD A boquet of yellow roses!!!!! They are beautiful!! I Love them... I love him! Its our 2 year mark, ladies and gentlemen. How about that, huh?

Saturday I went to an Americana Music Festival at Jackson's Mill.. It was nice lots of different genres of music, lots of different bands.. There was a couple awesome bluegrass bands too, which was cool. I got tired of sitting though and I was starting to hurt - the concert was from 12-10pm. so wow.. Lol So Roy came and got me (after his day of squirrell hunting) and we went home. Then we went out to Gabes. He really really wanted to go watch Friday Night Lights but oooooooh I was sooooo tired. So he didn't get to see it this weekend :o( sorry, baby.

Sunday we got up and went to church and then we came home and ate wonderful steaks with sauteed onions and mushrooms- that my momma had made from our very own Cows hahaha- We just got this years meat a few days ago, Lol. Then Roy and I went for a walk which was beautiful!! I love the trees and everything this time of year. And we shot a couple squirrels and stuff.. And I got a lot of pretty pictures of the trees and what not.

He didn't have to leave Sunday- he stayed till Monday morning which was awesome because I love spending time with him. He makes me reeeeeal happy :oD Haha.. I'm such a cheeseball- but I love it.

Monday I was late for school b/c I wanted to spend 5 more minutes telling Jamies bye. It was worth it. Then I felt like poo when I came home and slept and slept and slept. And Today I felt like poo, too.. So I slept all day long, Lol. It was well worth it. I feel kinda better now. I'm going back to the doctor tomorrow. Hopefully Bailey will have some good news for me. I like Bailey because he actually listens and seems to care, which is always nice.

Today Roy James came home to get his bow and stuff- He and Thumper and Kelly (I guess thats Thumper's girl) and Big Rob came.. haha I guess no one had anything to do. So then they came, got the stuff that had forgotten, and went straight back to school. Lol He kills me...

He might be bringing a friend home this weekend- Rayvaughn. Thats probably spelled way wrong, but o well. Ray (thats what I'm gonna call him) Lives in DC and hasnt gone home at all since school started. So Roy offered to bring him here. Which is cool with me. He has to ask my dad first though, which I hope my dad says yes. Raevon is black. We're not gonna tell my dad that though, because I want to see the look on his face when he sees it for himself.. Teehee.. I'm bad, I know.. But O well. My dad doesnt have a problem with Jay anymore so I dont think he'll mind Ray. Hopefully not anyways.

Thursday I'm going to Shepards College for a tour which is gonna be cool cause its such a pretty little town!! Roy says I cant go there tho, b/c its too far away, Lol. But I'm just going to look anyways. Then Friday we have no school so I'm going to sleep all day long. Friday night I'm going to Fright Farm.... I guess

I dont really want to go to Fright Farm. Well, I do. Because I always have fun, but I dont because Meredith is organizing this and I'm THIS |--| close to beating her ass!

I dont want to go into details on here. But anyways.. I just want to have fun and try not to think about her, Lol.. I dunno if I'm going for sure or not, but I most likely will..

I'm gonnna go do homework!

I got AutoCad :o) Thanks!!!


I need to bake more cookies for Roy and Big Rob. I'll get right on that! Yessir."

First of all- I'm hungry again. I ate breakfast at like 6:30 this morning then I didnt eat again unntil like 6:30 this evening. And now I'm REAL hungry again. All I did today was sleep b/c I didn't feel good. Which actually I still dont feel very well. 

I think that there is a chance that I might perhaps have Fibromalrogia. Okay, so I probably spelled that really wrong. But thats what it is. I want to find out what is wrong with me so that I can have a legitimate diagnosis and so that I can move on to the steps of recovery. Fibromoralgia, however, has no cure but there are things such as diet and certain excercises that can help ya feel better.

Holly just informed me that she recently met Daniel Hayhurst. O-joy! . . .

Anyways!

They're tearing down my beautiful dream home. I'm going to cry! Tomorrow after school I want to go up and get some nice video footage. There is like NOTHING inside... Its so sad... OMG the PORCH.... It makes my stomach turn just to think about them tearing that majesty down.. *vomit* it sucks.

Saturday is going to be lots of fun. I'm going to Adam and Shanna Bond's house at 12:30 for a cookout and stuff. And then the Vaughns are gonna be playing which I love their music so that will be fun. Then I have to come home and get ready for Homecoming which is at 8:00. My date is Leah- we'll be the hottest couple there, Lmao..

Roy James cant wait till Saturday either!! He's going up to Nick's family's farm in Ohio and they're gonna hunt! B/c Saturday is the first day of bow season in Ohio. Yay! I'm really happy for him b/c he's sooooooo excited. Every person that he talks to he's like 'I'm going to Ohio this weekend and going bow hunting!' Lol He's like a little kid at Christmas! I Love him so much.. He is my Wonderful. :oD

This weekend was amaznig. First of all, let me just say that I [heart] feeling needed and having a purpose. I love to make Roy happy and I would and do, do anything for him. I love it!! He and Nick came in. I got to spend a LOT of time with Roy. I love him. :o)
Okay so Leah came home from school with me and we played around with hair and makeup for Homecoming. I think I'm gonna do her makeup for HC. I figured mine out too. And my hair. And then Roy and Nick got home and then Miranda came over. Roy and Nick went to Dick's and to the football game... Us girls went out to eat and to the mall... Then I came home, the boys came home later.. I made up the couch bed and stuff.. and watched some TV with them.. Hmm.. Leah called and invited us to go to the WVU vs. James Madison game.. But Nick's from Ohio so he didn't seem interested. Roy was real excited at first but then he decided that getting his bow ready for Saturday was more important. So I told Leah no- but Huge Thanks anyways!!! So we went to Jerry's Sporting goods and messed with the bow for a while. Then we went to this Hunting and Fishing festival thingy.. It was really nice! Fun, fun.. There was a few really nice moose things there!!! But it was kinda pricey.. so I didnt get anything. Its okay though! Then! We came home and ate dinner and Jason and Jena and Silas and Brent and Julie came over and ate with us. Then we shot bow... Then... Nick left and everyone else slowly went home.. And.. Sunday was beautiful. Church- lunch at Mimi's to celebrate Christnia's b-day.. Then Roy and I spent the rest of the evening together!!! We shot bow and then it was time to take him back to Glenville :( Me and my mom washed the boys clothes and made them cookies to take back down with them. I Love Roy.. Thats all there is to it! I'm gonna marry him- yup!


My uncle Kermit said that he 'heard' some things not so nice about Roy being unfaithful to me. Let me just say- Ryan.. Talking to other girls isn't cheating. I can talk to whatever guy I want and Roy can talk to whatever girl he wants. You need to keep your mouth shut, boy. You're a great person but you seriously need to work on your people skills. Okay? Thanks.

Leah and Miranda think Nick is good looking. They want to meet more of Roy's friends. Lol! They need a good guy. So does my cousin Christina.. She's so sweet.

Well I'm super tired and I feel like poo.. I'm still hungry.. I havent talked to Roy AT ALL today!!! :o( I dont know where he is.. Hrm..

I bought sweet lingere tonight ;o) Bargain price too- I love cleanance sales!

I also bought a hat for my pirate costume. Yay. Halloween is fun b/c you get to dress up and be silly. Silly is great. I think I'm gonna have everyone over for some fun spotlight in the field and whatnot. What do you think??

I think its time for bed."

I want to go 'catfeeshin'

Yes, I do. I am a fisherwoman.



I have homework. I [heart] food!

I want to hold baby Silas and kiss him and kiss him! I Love him! Its so funny b/c I really don't even know him- I mean I just met him. He's only 10 days old- but I love him!!

I just heard on the news that some old softcore porn director died. And also, Marlon Brando ashes have been successfully scattered.

Roy's catfishing with Nick, he borrowed Rob's pole. He sounded like he was happy and having fun when he called. So I hope he is :) I hope he's being good.

I made a logo for Drafting. Its a fat little cartoon pirate. He's my logo for my title bar on my template. I didn't name him yet. Any suggestions? No. Because no one reads this! Mwuhaha. Its called Pirate Productions :o)
I REALLY miss him... I'm so silly. I worry about him a lot, but I really trust him. :oD


Okay. I have homework. I need to shower and do my hair. I need to get on the ball!!!


I'm not into drinking and getting wasted. I wouldn't want my Jamies to do it- and I'm not gonna do it. I'll hang around here with him this weekend.

But I [heart] my friends.


Okay. Michael is just being a PETA person right now. So we're going to pretend that he doesnt exist hahaha!! There's nothing wrong with fishing, its not killing fish, silly. But he called me a murderer and said that when people who fish catch them and watch them flop, that the flopping is the fish dying by suffocation. And that its sick. LMAO- What a crackhead.

Daniel needs to just not ever effing call me again. Hi, Daniel, you're my boyfriend's friend. He's not here- at college. Don't call me- I don't like you. Don't want to talk to you. I'm not bored and even if I was, I wouldn't call you- and CERTAINLY would not come up and see you. Congrats on your job though. No since in being a loser.


I'm gonna be Pirate. A sexy little Pirate lady for Halloween. Got the fabric picked out for my outfit and everything! Got the design in my head, I'm ready to go.

I'm not playing in the Powder Puff game this year b/c my mom doesnt want me to. She doesnt think I'm healthy enough and she doesn't want me to get hurt. So I'm not playing, but I will my senior year! So o well.

For Spirit week we have duct tape day and I'm making pants. They're almost done, but they're too tight in the thighs so I have to loosen 'em.

Gonna go. <3

I Love Roy James. I miss him and I want to be in his arms right now . . ."

Basically everywhere my from chest to my pelvic area- you cant touch it b/c it hurts
Throbbing and Pulsing all over my body
Heart beating way too hard

Sometimes I just hurt so bad all over. Its like my body is screaming for me to just lie down.
My symptoms are always there- just usually very light and cause me no problems. Now, if I do something extra to exert myself in any way- like washing the car- I'm done. I just have to sleep. Thats, like, all I do anymore. Is just sleep- all the time. And I love sleeping and all, but I would like to be able to go out to the mall one evening after school- and not be so exhausted from 'my big extra activity' that I have to take the entire next day to recooporate. When we went to Kennywood- I walked a LOT... When we got home it was maybe the slowest week of getting back to normal that I've had since I've been sick. It sucked.

If I acted as shitty as I felt- as often as I felt this way- Thats all I would get done doing. I would never be able to just be.. normal. And my friends say that I act perfectly fine and just like all of them. And I'm glad to hear that. Because I try my hardest to do just that. It would be nice to be able to think that its all just in my head and that I can think it away. But no matter how much I try to forget about it and pretend that there is nothing wrong with me- Its still there. And my body is constantly remindng me of that.

I'm not THAT sick. I highly doubt that what is wrong with me is anything serious, or life threatening. But its hard to get used to. And it sucks to have to deal with it. I could be 10x worse and there are people that are sooooo worse off than me. And I'm REALLY THANKFUL that I'm not worse. But obviously, I'm not 100% healthy. And obviously, there is something wrong with me that is hindering me from every day, normal activities.

It just gets old, and I get frustrated."

I am IN LOVE with him. I want to marry him. Everyday I wake up and think 'I have a future with a wonderful man' And my day is made. I don't know what kind of future I have now. I hurt. I want him to hold me. I want him to be happy. If this is what he needs... Then. He can have it. But I feel like shit right now. And I will for a while. Its not fair. I just want him to hold me. I need for him to love me back. I know that he LOCES me. I just dont know that he is IN LOVE with me. He doesnt know. We're just together too much. We got too close. Too much like just friends. He's my best friend. Ever. He's always been there for me. And I always have- and always will- be there for him. No matter what

I Love Roy James McIntyre. With all of my heart. He has all of me. Every ounce of goodness in me belongs to him. He is my Love. What will I do without him? He went off to college and it was like my best friend moved away. But I still had my boyfriend. What do I have now? A long distance best friend. A long distance best friend that I am very much in love with. You can't do anything to stop or change love."

"event","Okay. So I had a big ol entry typed. Then what? My computer decided it didn't want to cooperate. Okay so back onto what I was saying...

First off let me quote the best quote of the day:
'Mom, you are just so gay. Seriously. Like, don't even talk to me.'
Hahaha.. Oh I love it! You actually called your mom gay. Thats just great.

So Mandi is going to Homecoming with Justin Sommerville. Yay- good for her! Hopefully it'll go better than last years. Because we all know what happened last year with Mr. Ty Garcia.. ahem.

Lets take a moment of silence for last year's homecoming mayhem

[moment]

Alrighty.

So I'm watching the Republican Convention. Why? Because I like W. Why? Because he wears cowboy boots and a hat. Plus he's just a fun guy. Yeah I said it...... I [heart] CONDALIZA RICE! Yeah! Whoo hoo... Alright. I've composed myself again haha.

Oh man. So I haven't talked to Roy yet today. He's not coming home this weekend. Which makes me sad, but I don't want him to know that. I want him to miss me and need me like I do for him. Lol! See... He's an hour away from me. I don't see him during the week. I'm not going to see him this weekend [so he says] Okay. Thats a lot different from 24/7/365. Okay.. well more like 20 hours a day/7 days a week/360 days a year. Yeah Its literally been like that, no joke. I think its only normal to miss him. And for him to miss me and think about me. I know I think about him, Lol. Like, I'll be around other guys and think like 'Oh! Roy has a shirt like that' or 'Oh he was just talking about [that one video game] Roy likes that game!' I mean, that might be pathetic hahaha. But oh well. He's my best friend. And I totally miss him. I hope he misses me too :o/ I'm sure he does though.

He's making lots of new friends.. like..
Thumper, Peanut, Cricket, Journey, Robert, Dave, Andrew, Craig.. ya know Lol
All those guys with those funny names.
Well I'm defnintely glad that he's having a good time though.

Its kinda funny because he's taking a computer landscaping class and doing land surveying stuff. And in a few [or 6 or 9 or so maybe] weeks, I'll be doing the same thing. I dunno, lol I find that interesting.

Roy might need tutoring in reading and I might need tutoring in math. Haha.. Now if we were together we could just help each other out!

Mmmmmm..... Keebler Elf S'more cookies. I'm in a 2 minute Heaven...

Tech Center has kinda sucked so far because.. Well no one talks. Everyone has their own little clicks with people within their classes/home schools. Here I am. Just me- haha. Briana and Nicole are there, but I never see them! So...... Oh well, I'm there to learn not make new friends. It'll be worth it. Well.. once we finally start doing something. Besides hard math that I'm no good at. But noooo I have Mr-I'm-in-Honors-Trig sitting beside me! Haha wow. Talk about feeling stupid. Oh well. I'll have him help me, Lol

My doctors appointment was changed from next Wednesday..... Well okay.
I have a Dr. appt. With Dr. Bryant [jaw] Wednesday at 11. And I was supposed to go to the Disease Center at 2. But now I go to the Center on Friday at 10:30. Sooo... o well, I guess? Lol... At least I'll be in Morgantown when Jena has Silas. She's having the C-section Friday morning. So.. yay! Lol I bet he'll be sooo cute!

Well. I really don't feel very well so I think I'm going to go."

I'm bored and I have to pee right now.

I miss Roy, and my mom is sad about something :o(

I did my homework and I still gotta take a shower

I had spaghettit for dinner! Mmmm Thanks, Mom!

I don't like my dad, really... I think he's kind of a turd.
Sometimes I really really wish he'd just go away....
I shouldn't think like that, but sometimes, he makes me feel such hatred towards him. And I hate the fact, that he has the power over me, to make me feel such a strong, horrible emotion like hatred.

I feel like dancing, though.

I never get to see my friends anymore. Not at school anyways. I guess its okay- I mean I'm supposed to focus on my studies.. right? Lol

Roy James got his Pell Grant and other finacial aids today- yay! I Love Him, Soooo Much! Honestly- I am truely, truely very much in love. And I Love it! :o) This weekend was nice, we got to spend it with each other and it was fun.

Also I went to Jena/Jason/Silas's baby shower. It was okay.. we played a couple stupid games haha! Then we ate cake, and watched the opening of the presents. They got loads of nice stuff! But someone else got them what we got them [it was an extremely adorable Jumperoo- I want one!] So we're gonna take it back and get them something that they really need. I think, like, a stroller or some bigger clothes b/c he's not gonna be real small.... I can't wait! Lol from the 4D picture, I think he looks just like Jason! He even has the cute little pug nose :o)

I really miss Kyra!!!

"event","Alright so school started Thursday. It was.. okay. Lol Actually it wasn't that bad at all b/c I was home by 11:30! Whoo hoo for me!

Schedule
1st Biology - Lynn
2A  ACT Test Prep Stratagies - Vincent
2B  Applied Geometry - Vincent
- Then I have to eat first lunch with the freshman and sophmores and of course I know about 0% of them... 
Then for the rest of the day I go to the Tech Center for Drafting & CAD

My classes at school are okay. Mr. Lynn is a bit of a kook... And Mrs. Vincent- well she's just Mrs. Vincent, what can I say? She can be real nice, she can be real mean... This girl, Nicole, she's a senior and she seems really nice! She's in my Geom class and I sat with her at lunch, Lol. Because she goes to the Tech Center in the afternoons too. She actually knows some frosh and sophs though.. Like.. Hope and Harley... So I sat with them... Ahem. O well, haha.

The tech center.. Hm... Well Thursday I didnt have to go b/c it was a 2 hour early dismissal. So I got to go home way earlier than everyone else because I basically had no 3rd or 4th block. Yay... Now onto Friday... I am the only girl in there. And I mean it wouldn't be so bad- but okay. Not one single person in there speaks. Period. They just like, dont talk.. and Especially not to me. I might be a girl, but I'm not some kinda different species with contagious illnesses or something! The teacher seems nice though. His name is Mr. Heaster. There is only 4 other guys in that class so its small.. Heaster said that more people might be there next week. He also said I might not be the only girl, but the other girl is 'an adult' So.. I dunno if she's like 18 or like 38 haha. But O well... Its probably best that no one in there talks to me, because I have a feeling I'm going to um.. struggle. It all looks so amazing and I definitely want to get to know the CAD program and be able to use it for floor plans and such. And plus, the structure itself, the house- the architectural design has always, always fascinated me. Even before the interior design. I mean, you construct the interior design from its surroundings, which is the house or building, itself. I don't want to just be the 'designer' I want to be the Designer, the Decorator, the Carpenter, the Architect.. I want to do it all. Hehe... Even if I cant actually do it all, having some architectural knowledge and the experience of working with CAD, under my belt will defnitely, definitely help TONS in getting me a job. Things like that can be a deciding factor in whether you get hired, ya know. Yep. The AutoCad program looks like loads of fun, and I really really hope that once I get used to it, I'll be good at it. Ya know? Cause, there's math involved to an extent... and I'm not so good with the numbers... Haha.. Well I guess we'll just have to see. I'm gonna stick with it though, and try my best.

Ryan left without Roy James last night. Haha...... So we had to go down to Gelnville and get him. The upper classmen were having a 'beach party'.... In Gelnville. Yeah.. It was like small yard filled with sand a volleyball net. Haha. They seemed to be having though. There wasn't very many people down there though. And the music, oh goodness. I dont think they could have gotten it any louder. I mean it was just so annoying haha. You couldnt escape it anywhere. So I went up to the 6th floor and allll the way down the hall (Passed Ryan and Thumper's room on the way, and read their pink note board- it said they'd be back Monday) and when I got to Roy's room I knocked and went in. The hallways are pretty skanky but the rooms are nice. There's lots of storage, and enough room to walk around and stuff. Roy's side of the room was all straight and looked really nice! Lol I was surprised. They got a big TV and a PS2 and computer and what not.. Plus a microwave and mini fridge with food, so I'd say they're all set. So we loaded up his dirty clothes, and headed home. We stopped at Gino's Pizza and Pasta to eat first though. And it was sooo good. And the people that worked there were so polite and friendly. It was very nice.

Alrighty, well there ya go.

- I didnt get to meet any of Roy's friends yet though, because they had mostly all already gone home for the weekend. I did see Dave though.. I dont think he looks like Doug Cuppett but everyone else seems to think so, Lol

"event","And its soooo not fun!! I'm all nausiated and I have to get up early and go to school tomorrow. Which sucks. Mainly only because I want to sleep. School's not so bad.. I guess. Lol 

So last night I got my hair cut and I L-l-love it! Yes. Love it. Yay!

So I get home at like 9:30 and its all dark, and my pup wont go inside she just stood at the door. So I thought'Hmmm...' And I go in.. And Roy jumps out from behind the door. He was supposed to be in Glenville, not in my laundry room. Haha! He's sooo super sweet though. I love him this much *spreads arms as wide as they will go* I love him that much plus 10,000,000,000 more. Yes it makes perfect sense! :o) Hahaha.. 

So yeah and he went back today. [he likes my hair too, by the way!]He and Ryan were supposed to go back last night, but Ryan didn't want to, then they were supposed to leave early this morning, but they didnt. They were supposed to leave at 2pm- but they didnt. Haha. So basically, they left too late so he didn't get to register for classes. He's getting all kind-of discougared and what not. But I hope he sticks with it. I think it'll definitely be worth it. He called after he got there today, to say that he forgot his dorm key! Haha! Then- get this- he wanted to know if my mom would bring it down to him. Lol... Anyways he found it though, in Ryan's car. 

Last night me and Roy went over to Jason and Jena's and they weren't home but the lights and TV and stuff was on. So of course I think 'OH! She went into labor!!!' But.. Roy drove over to Brent's [which I didn't even know where Brent and Julie lived, haha] So we get there, and Jason and Jena are there. We visited with them for a while. And then I came home and spent time with Roy and I slept in today! Whoo hoo! Hoooray for sleeping!!! Its the best...... I swear..

So today then Miranda called me and she said she was going to get her hair cut. So I went along with her to the mall. But we ended up leaving late [hehe, I wasn't ready yet- but it wasn't my fault] So... we decided to just stay at the mall, since we didn't end up getting there till about 3 and we were supposed to meet the other girls at 5 to watch Without a Paddle!! Which, by the way, was an amazing movie. I loved it and I laughed a WHOLE LOT! Haha........ O man.. The best scene was when they stumble upon those rednecks pot farm.. Hahaha... That was funny! So Miranda got her hair cut today and what not. And we caught up with Eliza, and Jenna, and Meredith for the movie.. and
we saw Laura today at the mall a few times *Hi Laura* She said that Roy could live in the backseat of her car- haha! She's really nice.

My doctor's appointment is Sept. 8th!! This one I'm actually looking REALLY forward to!!! They're gonna make me alllll better.. :o)

Seriously though, my head hurts.. I'm kinda hungry- but then, I'm ALWAYS hungry...."

Anyways. I had a doctors appt. tonight and it sucked! haha... Well the waiting was about 10x worse than the actual sonogram. Which is retarded b/c I dont even know why I had to get it. But whatever, I guess its best to check everything and be better safe than sorry, right? Yeah. So I had to drink 32oz of water and hold it for a long time. Then some gay guy pushed on my tummy and took some pictures of the inside of it. He said it looked okay. Which is good :o) Good news.
I thought I was going to explode though!!! MAN! Haha..

So about 10:00 tonight I hear this truck come flying up my driveway. 2 minutes later Roy is in my room. Lol.... He's so insane. It was a really nice surprise though :o) Yay! All that for just a hug, but I think it was worth it. He's really sweet. Robert has a couple lady friends, and Roy borrowed one of their trucks. He's funny. It was nice though- made me really happy. I love him so so very much! -super cheesy smile-

"event","Whoa. It just now hit me. I mean its easy to say. But it just now actually HIT me. For the first time, in like 2 years... Me and Roy won't see each other every say. He won't be just across the road every night. Its weird. I mean he's only gonna be like 45 min - 1 hour away. But its not like he can call me up at midnight and say 'Hey I'm hungry' And I can make him hot ham and cheese sandwich, along with a Nutty butty bar, and a can of orange soda and take right over to him- within minutes. And he won't be coming over early in the morning and waking me up every day. (Will I miss that? Haha!) Lol Just little things like that will be different.

I mean, he's here almost alll the time. Not so much lately. But I mean, he's just been busy. Well, probably because he's getting ready to leave for college! Haha! But of course I didn't think of it that way. I think it will be really good for us though- to get a chance to miss each other. Which, we will. It'll be hard at first, but I defnitely think that it'll be worth it. He's really excited and I'm happy for him too. He'll be able to go to school, and get a job down there and save up money and stuff. Which will make him really happy! Plus, he'll have a phone and be here on the weekends. Well, like Saturday night and Sunday, probably. 

Basically, I just walked into my room and all the stuff, all his clothes and shoes, that have been 'in my way' for soo long. Are just gone. And its kinda weird. But I don't think it'll take much getting used to b/c I'll be REALLY busy this school year- trying to actually go to school and also do the work, haha. Plus, I'll have my friends. And this will all be good :o)

As long as he's happy, I'm happy. Plus, after the whole 'army rejection' thing, he went straight to this. Wasn't discouraged or anything. Which really inspires me. I'm really very proud of him.

Haha! He and Ryan took soooo many clothes! Lol, I seriously did not realize that Roy had that many clothes!! I guess things look different jam-packed in the trunk of a car.

Okay. So I ran a nail into my foot and it HUUUUURT!! And it still HUUUUUURTS!!! Gr >:o( I just had a tetnus shot, not that long ago though. And I don't think the nail was rusty. See, it was a whole bag of nails lying on the flood beside the bed in the hunting room. Well, I was standing on the bed (helping with the antlers) and I fell off. Foot landed on the bag of nails. Lol, so I didn't get to see which nail it was. It hurts though, to like step down on it or anything, so I look real stupid when I walk, haha! I think I'd look more graceful walking in stilettos. I doctored it up pretty well, I think though. Sooo, guess I'll just hafta get over it! I wanna play volleyball tomorrow though, which is gonna be kinda challenging. Hm..."

I'm excited b/c we havent all been together in forever. Well, every Christmas we are. But this is summer and we can be outside and we're having a cookout (mmm). So this is good. I hope its nice tomorrow. Roy was having trouble setting the volleyball net up so I tried to help him... O, boy. Watch out! Lol.. He did a VERY VERY good job at controlling his temper though. Much better than I could have. Eventually, my mom saw how much trouble we were having and came out and helped us. Its up and now and looks great, actually. :o) I cleaned my room, today! Whoo hoo! Go me. Also, I cleaned one of the bathrooms, and helped Mom with the laundry and fun stuff like that. I cleaned up the new room all nice and stuff. Yeah. Well the bathroom and the new room. Lets call it the Hunting room. The bathroom and the hunting room are trashed now. Why? Well because I asked my dad to put the antler hat racks up on the wall. Yeah. He has to go and make it super complicated and 'eff' it up. Ugggghh!!! >:o( There are only 2 antlers up but the whole rooms is trashed and there's tools and crap all over the place. And the bathroom? Well I sat down on the toilet and the seat felt kinda wiggly. Well I just thought it was funny, I mean its not like it freakin fell off or something! Haha! No. Whats he do? He tries to fix it- but doesnt. Goes to Lowes. Buys stuff. Comes home- works on it some more and proclaimed to have finally fixed it. I tried it out. Literally- its absolutely no different than before. Hahaha! Alllllllllll day to do those two little chores! Allllllllllllll day Looooooong!! Ah! He drives me insane. And of course theres about 100,000,000,000,000 cuss words thrown in there b/c he can't get the antlers up, or the seat fixed. Aggravating. So yeah this is how my day has been Lol. And my mom is just now starting to clean the house (like dust and vaccum) and she's totally stressed out. My dad definitely needs to just chill out and leave her alone so she can get stuff done. I really really want to go to the new Cabela's with Roy somtime! I think that would be lots of fun. I figured he'd go with Ryan, but Ryan went with his dad. So maybe me and Roy will go :o) There is a full body mount of a moose! Yay! I need a new icon for on here. I'll hafta get me one. Okay so I'm seriously bored now and I'm gonna go clean some more. Later"

"event","Alright. So I'm completely done, haha. I mean I am sooo tired, so this definitely won't be long. I feel like poo, my stomach hurts but hopefully I didn't do too much today. I'm pissed because I havent had much problems with my jaw lately. But no, today it hasn't opened all the way- at all - not once. Yeah which is annoying. I went thru the drive thru at BK and got an amazing Tendercrisp chicken sandwich and I was sooo hungry (kinda like I am now, haha) But can I eat it? No. I can't open my mouth wide enough to get it in my mouth. Pissed me off.. I ate it though, took my like 20 minutes haha! Well.. not quite that long, but ya know. It wasn't easy.

*Note* I've been sitting here playing with my jaw, and it opened once. But it won't go all the way now. I tried Roy's method, of just forgetting about it and trying to snap it open real quick. Haha, that doesn't work but it kinda hurts. Maybe if I get it open and just leave it open- haha maybe that will work. 

Oooh.. so tonight we went Wal-Marting and spent bucoos of money haha. It was great, I love food. Also, I love sleep and my awesome bed is calling for me to lie down on it and just close my eyes. So thats totally what I've got to do right now.

Until tomorrow . . ."

*Huge thanks to Holly for helping out and making my LJ fun and pretty*
(and also for being patient with my ignorance while she was trying to explain it to me) Haha! Yay. Big thnx.

Well since I've done absolutely nothing yet today, I guess I should go do something... I'll probably go shoot my bow and let Roy make fun of my terrible grouping! Heh :o)

"event","Alrighty. So Roy and Ryan never did go out. Lol so I would have been waiting quite a while, had I have stayed and waited. But I didn't. Kari called and asked if I wanted to go to this church thing so I did. It was nice. The food was really good and then we played some Survivor themed games.. I thought- Hey Lets be on the Out wit team and do puzzles- simple stuff! No, it was like the hardest puzzle I've ever done b/c they didnt give us all the pieces- haha. Whoa. And the bonfire was nice. I didn't know any of the songs except the last one b/c it was in O Brother Where Art Thou. Haha, isn't that sad? Oh man those girls that Kari watches are soo cute! The littlest one, Emily, she's basically insane and its great haha. Kari said Emily gets it from her dad, which I could kinda tell that from tonight haha. It was a good time though..... Whoa! Have you ever seen a 5 year old that looked like she was an infant??? Yeah. Thats weird. I saw one tonight. It was quite different. Lol Her name was Mckayla or something? And she had a 3 year old sister who was about twice her size. They were both cute though... The tiny one was kind of possessed/exorcist looking- but in a small and cute way. Yes, that makes perfect sense. Hahaha. Yeah so the 3 year old, who's the bigger one decided she wanted to climb on top of her Fisher price kitchen set, and onto the roof of her Barbie house and jump off. Which was frightening at first b/c she fell. The Kari volunteered to catch her and put her back up on the roof about 1,000,000 times. There was lost of little girls running around and screaming Lol It reminded me of the daycare center. It was all good fun though, they were really nice people. I should do things like that more often with my church. Because they do have those kind of little activites, I just don't go. Haha. But I just might start. I think I'm gonna go more often, like Sunday or Wednesday nights sometimes. I always kinda feel like I miss something or I need to know more, So I might just go more often.

By the way! I still feel pretty good today. Which is good news. Hopefully this feel-good-feeling will last :o] I have a Doctor's appt. Monday which I'm not looking forward to, but I suppose its for the best, Lol. 

Ah well, I think I'm going to get out of here. Eventually I'm going to figure out to have beautify my journal and make it look real snazzy.

I am in love with my leg warmers, all I need now are tights.

"event","Tuesday was Amanda's b-day!!! Lol I did NOT forget it, I just didn't know it was the 17th when I posted my entry on Tues. But I did tell her happy b-day and all that good stuff. :o) I wish I could see her more, we used to be like best friends.. Now I feel like I hardly know her.. But O well, we'll just have to change that won't we!!!
- Well school is just entirely too close to being here!! And it SUCKS. Yeah. It does. So Mr. Brown sent out the newletters yesterday I got it. Not fun to read. Anyways, so basically if we don't shape up and quit skipping school all the time, and not caring if we pass a class or not..... Our school's getting shut down. *Takes a minute to think about the losers at my school* Yeah so basically our school is getting shut down. Haha! What really blows though, is that I heard this year is the last year for it. Okay- so that means I have to attend one high school for 3 years then switch, and graduate from another school. What? Thats retarded. Lol O well... Maybe I can meet new people? :-/ Eh... anyways, I dunno I'd prob... Go to.. ? Byrd? Probably. Oh well. I guess.. Lol I mean its not like there's anything I can do about it.
- So get this: Me and Roy thought that we could go up to Glenville this Saturday and set up his room and all. But no. Its Sunday. So we then decided ""Oh, okay we'll just go later in the day Sunday"" (We have church, and plus its Mimi's Birthday) Mimi is my grandma, and we're haiving something for her, here at my house. So okay, I call Student Life- and the 'Move in and Orientation' time is from 10am-2pm... So that means Roy's gonna have to go up with Ryan earlier than we had planned. And it also means that Tara does not get to be involved with this big thing that her boyfiend is involved in. Yeah I'm Jealous.. Hehe.. Lol! Anyways so its just a change of plans, and basically Change of plans- always catches me off guard and ticks me off a little but O well. I'll be over it in a little bit. 
- So I want to go walking at the VA and what not and get in shape along with my friends, but I'd prob get to walking like 20 feet and then pass out. Haha. I'm so pathetic anymore, O well. I'll get better - so they tell me... Lol! No, I know I will. It just gets old. Yesterday (and today) I actually felt really good! And of course when I have a good day I want to get out and go about and what not. But I don't have a way to do that. Legally.. Hmm.. My car is out there, no one's home. I can do whatever I want. Although, I'd probably get caught and then get my ass kicked haha.. So I'll sit here alone again I guess - hahaha! What a Life... But I love it though :o)
- Speaking of not being able to legally drive. I might get my permit Friday. Maybe haha who knows. We shall have to wait and see..... 

Well its really hot in my house so I'm gonna go change that and find something to do. Cya"

"event","*First off - Liza Madi is home from FL! Yay I missed her :) LY, Liza.

Man I love sleeping. I could sleep- literally- all day long. If no one woke me up, I'd just keep on sleeping. . . But! There's always those WONDERFUL telemarketers calling every 5 minutes! Grr. 
-So anyways I had this completely strange dream last night.. I dont even know where things like that come from! But anyways... It consisted of me and a few of my friends and a few of my family members... And we were just driving along on this road- Then all the sudden, there is these woods and you can't drive, you have to hike. So we're hiking and as we're hiking, these people are building a house in this big swampy area at the top of the hill. The further we walk, the more work that is done on the house. So by the time that we get to the top, the house is huge and beautiful, like 4 stories tall and everything haha. And there is a little road leading up to the house and these picnic pavilions. But you have to ride- get this- ostraches (I don't know how to spell that, lol) Yeah you have to ride those up the hill. And so we get to the house and the back of the house has no outside walls, which is odd... So we're all (the people one the big adventure) are staying in the picnic pavilions.. Because, of course these people wouldn't let us stay in their like 20 bedroom house! Haha.. I dunno dreams are weird. All I remember after that is that Kari snuck into the house and woke up the baby and got in trouble by the kid's mom, Lol... Weird..
-So today Roy and Ryan went up to Ohio to get Roy's tree stand. He left it up there last hunting season, I hope its still there!! Also, there is a key to unlock the tree stand from the tree... And I really hope he remembered to take it with him!! Cause that wouldn't be good to get all the way up there- then woops, we forgot the key. Haha! I guess that Robert guy didn't show up last night, just Thumper. Roy said that had a good time and that they get along. Which is good. I'm excited about Roy goin to college but I'm also nervous! Lol I know, I know, I'm so stupid about things like this. But oh well I can't help it. It'll be a big change not to be able to see him every single day, all the time. But I think it'll be good for us to have some time apart and be able to miss each other! :)
-Ugh. School starts.. I dunno in a week or so... I'm not too happy about that. I'm always kinda nervous/anxious and all, but I dunno. Last semester I missed sooooo much school b/c I was sick, and I really hope they find out whats wrong, so I can get better! Because I soo do not want to have to miss that much school again. Lol Its not fun getting that far behind and then having to make it all up! I'll have to go to bed at like 7:30 to get enough sleep to be able to function at school! Haha! Well of course, there's no way thats gonna happen, but it would probably be best for me. Haha, how about no thanks... Hmmm.. We shall see what happens!
-Well *Hi* To Eliza. Lol and welcome home! Its too bad that she wasn't around much this summer to go places and just chill with us. But thats okay, Lol. She didn't miss much! Hehe ;o] I'm glad she had lots of fun down there with her sis, and little nephew!! I heard that Jenna might move back to Cali for good. Whoa! I think thats crazy, b/c its right in the middle of high school. But she does have lots of family and friends out there so it wouldn't be bad for her. We'll miss her, but as long as she's happy I'm happy :o]
-Back to Eliza's little nephew... I'm gonna have a little nephew here soon. Any day now, they say! I can't wait Lol. Silas Hunter- how sweet. I REALLY miss Kyra Marie :o[ A lot! I wish they lived closer so I could see her more. Silas is gonna be right down the road, so I can see him all the time though, which will be nice! Jason and Jena want to move back to the farm here and build a log house.... Thats expensive! Lol I think they should wait a while, but they're very impatient, hehe. So we shall see what happens..

I'm done. Bye"

"event",":o] Yesterday Roy got Baptised :) It was so nice to see that . . . Ryan and his mom and dad came which was great I thought! Its always nice to have support and I think it made Roy happy. :) It made me happy, at least.
-Well today I had a Doctor's appt. WHICH SUCKED - well it wasn't THAT bad but ya know it wasn't fun haha! So then afterwards me and my aunt Jenny went shopping and I got tons of great stuff for Roy's dorm! Its all coordinated and its so cute. Ya know, cute for a guy Lol.. Its more neutral than exactly ""masculine"" or whatever. Different shades of blue and green - but I really like it! Thats all that matters, right? Hehe.. Well I got me a couple of things too like this really cute pink shirt and jewelery for my homecoming dress. . . Hmm... I'm really excited for Roy to go to college! I think it'll really make him feel great. He's the kind of person who wants a challenge and he's so excited to have a career and all that good stuff!! . . . Land resources? I think thats what the major is called? Thats a good major, in my opinion. Maybe he can landscape our yard all beautifully someday! Hehe
- He scared me today!! After I had spent a decent amount of money on that dorm stuff (which I was -and still am- so excited about)He told me that Diane (Ryan's mom) had already bought him stuff! So basically I freaked b/c I'm stupid like that haha, But then I called her (Diane - she's sooo nice!) and it turns out that she had only picked Roy up a couple of things while she was out getting stuff for Ryan - so no need to take things back. It all worked out! So tonight Roy, Ryan, and their room mates - Thumper and Robert - I think thats right.. They went out to eat at the Roadhouse and to shoot pool! Thumper called me and I got to talk to Roy for a couple seconds when he called Lol.. He seems nice. I hope they all get along well :) Cause getting along with ur room mates is important!! Roy said that they needed a TV for their room - and get this - he requested a 20 inch flatscreen! Haha! Wow, you know b/c I have money pouring out of my butt! Lol.. of course he was joking though...... Actually I never even found out if they really need a TV or not.. Hmm...
-I got the room done!! Yes! (Jason's old room, ya know the EXTREMELY cluttered 'hunting equiptment' room) So I had another idea for a design and my momma let me experiment in our house again! She's great. And thankfully the room turned out great too! We're waiting for a desk and a lamp that we ordered to come.. Perhaps I will post pictures of the room later b/c I don't really want to describe it all on here.
-I shot my bow tonight I'm still not good, but its so fun! And.. I seriously need to get my permit :-X I am soooooo bad about that... I should have had it like - 2 years ago almost! O man, that's sad.. 
-Well I'm done. See ya

*Just a note: I turned my cell on today and everything was in Japanese.. Of course I can't read Japanese. I tried to switch it back to English, but I couldn't read any of the menus - haha! So I took to to Cell one while I was at the mall and some guy named Chris helped me fix it- Thanks buddy."

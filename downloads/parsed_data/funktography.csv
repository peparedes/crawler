"event","this is ridiculous. i feel better, i look better, im healthier, my body is more toned, im thinner.
and i just tried on every pair of jeans in my closet and NONE OF THEM FIT. half of em i cant even get up, some dont zip, some do and theyre so tight it looks like im trying to squeeze myself into a size 0. 
something is wierd. 
like my body type is totally different now. in a really, really good way...but my pants are rebelling. which sucks cuz pants i used to fit into when i was fat, dont fit me now and im thinner than iwas.

my legs.
i got a cramp in my side during the last half mile and i was so pissed i could have gone the whole thing without walking too much (well, walk/jog is my walking) and i had to slow down because i couldnt stand up straight. 

but now im proud of myself. and im also 'svelte' apparently. my mom said that. ive never heard her use that word. i like that word. 

and on the plus side, now idont freak out about any kind of food i put in my mouth and feel like im gonna get fat bc i run like 3 miles a day. so its all taken care of

"event","amazing.

so i bought a 20D today. i met this photographer on the cape where i am right now who took all our family pictures so my mom could have some new ones...blah. unimportant. and we went to his studio to look at the proofs...i had mentioned to him before that i was an avid photographer/aspiring photojournalist etc etc. and while i was at his studio we started talking about cameras and my mom mentioned we had been looking to find one for me for christmas. well, he says ""oh i have a 20D i could sell you for about 600 bucks"" now, see, heres the best part. the package deal. i could not pass this up.

1 barely used 20D camera body, great condition

2 512mb memory cards

1 charger

1 disc for the new and improved canon software

1 power cord

1 set of lense covers

1 brand new strap (still in the box)

1 manual

1 1:5.6 55-80 lense (not a kit lense, he bought it separately)

all for the grand total of 600 bucks.

im flying. where else ya gonna find a deal like that. so now, of course, its attached to me.

he said he would just add it on to the price of the prints my parents order, so technically i haven't even paid for it yet. he just GAVE it to me. he was selling it for 800 and he knocked it down 200 because he would ""rather see me have it than some person he's never met"" and did i mention it was the second time i talked to him?

im pretty excited."

i have SO MUCH HOMEWORK to do in the next 10 days i cant even function.
i never should have agreed to try and be friends again, because everything is happening exactly the same way and i feel shitty for wondering
i've lost 7 pounds. i have 8 more to go. and i dont want a lecture. 
i got a new hat. its pretty cool. it covers my ears and my art teacher thinks i look like a beatnik in it. 
i learned how to play 'greystone chapel' on the guitar this week. im not good at it yet, but i have it memorized, i just have to get better at it. i can play blackbird with my eyes closed now. thats always good. penny needs new strings soon.
im getting a mac for graduation. and a bicycle...FINALLY MY BIKE.
im going to chicago for a weekend with my mom 
im cutting my hair on saturday. bangs. and also going really dark. its time for a change. im sick of blonde hair. er. sort of blonde. im sick of it being light. time to go dark again
i swear i do things just because people tell me they dont like it. most people think i look better with lighter hair. 
blah.

i really need to get away from my roommate. maybe its just end of the year frustration. but im so sick of her and her bullshit. constantly.

and, now that its the end of the year i can safely say it has been the WORST year of my life. absolutely. worst year. i have been miserable for the majority of it, and when i wasnt miserable, i was only barely over the line.

i dont know why, because theres no reason to BE friends in the first place, and i'm going to be difficult to convince otherwise.

its almost graduation. this is my last week of english. after that i have the world's easiest schedule. 
im going to suffolk...looks like. since my hopes of getting into SLU on the waiting list are getting slimmer by the day. 
im frustrated. i want to move out, go home, forget everything.
but im riding again full time over the summer, i;ve lost 3 pounds working out so far, i want to lose more. im obsessed, its sick. i hate my roommate most f the time but its ok, i know the feeling is mutual. 
im saying hate alot. really. i just cant think of any other word. so, deal.
i really thought i was done thinking about it, too. i was convinced there was nothing that could be said to bring me back in, but now, i find myself wanting to start over and try. again, when there is no hope, i try and find some. i dont know. i cant believe anything he says, but i want to. i know its all stupid, i know it doesnt mean anything. and i try to remind myself of just how cheap and meaningless everything between us has become in hte past 8 months...holy shit. 8 months. thats a long time to be depressed. at least now im not depressed anymore, just extremely angry. after im done being angry, we'll see. but yeah. anger, convinced the entire thing was a piece of crap...which it probably was. whatever. uhgghghs.fgfdh

can i graduate, now, please? i just want to get out. i just want to go home. i cant deal with school anymore. 
3 weeks left. then i never have to come back to this fucking school with all its bad memories ever again. 
ever.

i can go somewhere else, and find new people who will break my heart."

"event","WHY IS THE 30D SO GODDAMN EXPENSIVE!!!
seriously, for the body ONLY (im pickin my own damn lense, im not using that crappy kit lense) is 1300 bucks. come on, people.

does anyone know a reputable place to buy used cameras in good condition? i want to save money on the body. i can find a nice lense and all that somewhere else easily, but finding a 30D body at a good price is wicked hard. 

someone help me out, and ignore the fact that i said wicked."

Usually I ignore these questions, but this one posed an interesting moral quandary at a time when I had nothing better to do, so I will attempt to answer it, though not necessarily in the order of questions posed, but rather in an order that I choose.

<lj-cut>
1. What if it was a child?

As someone who works a lot with kids, I've developed the instinct to help kids and protect them. If there was a child in danger, I would almost certainly risk my life to save him or her (as long as it made sense to do so. I'm not jumping into a rip tide to grab a kid when there's a trained lifeguard around to do so, for instance. Especially since I'm not that strong a swimmer myself). I would try to be sensible about things and take the least risky method for both of us.


2. Adult strangers

While I'd like to say I'd risk my life to save an adult stranger, I think part of it depends on the situation and how I perceive the chances of me being able to help versus just getting both of us killed. I'm not particularly strong or athletic, so while I would be able to hoist most preschoolers and carry them out of a burning building, I'd struggle to move an unconscious adult. Also, it would depend on how long I thought it would take me to save them versus how long I thought it would take trained and equipped rescuers to arrive versus how long it would take for the situation to become deadly. If there's a house fire and I know there's a stranger inside but can hear the sirens, then I'm waiting for the firefighters. If there's someone struggling to free him or herself from a seat-belt as gasoline leaks from the flipped car's tank, I'd go over and see what I could do (not that I carry a knife or anything that would be particularly helpful in that situation). I don't think I would give an elderly person any more or less consideration than another adult, though the fact that an elderly person might be lighter or might be more fragile/have other disabilities might come into play when I'm assessing risks. And then again, I might just panic and freeze.

3. Dog or cat

Our cat and dogs are members of the family, so if it was one of them then I'd run to help in a heartbeat. With strange dogs and cats, the situation becomes more iffy. I know our animals well enough to handle them in stressful situations, and they all recognize and trust me. A strange dog or cat might be much more inclined to bite, scratch, or otherwise fight against rescue attempts, leading to myself being injured/less capable of getting us out in time, and delaying the rescue attempts because I might not be able to get close enough. Panicked animals are dangerous, and I don't have the training to handle them. So it would depend very much on what my gut was saying at the time, though I would want to save them.

"event","Some of you may know that I recently picked up a new roleplaying system recently. <i>The Burning Wheel</i> is an independently published system; there isn't a company like WotC or SJ Games behind it, but there does seem to be a somewhat active community, between the forums and wiki, and the creator is definitely involved in both.

I can't really decide what system the character creation reminds me of. Instead of picking a class like in D&D, or buying advantages and disadvantages like in GURPS, you choose lifepaths for your character. The lifepaths you choose open up skills, traits, and resources for your character, as well as determining how old your character is, so that part's a bit more structured than GURPS, plus your character comes with a built-in sketchy history.

Speaking of history, your character also gains resource points that can be spent not only on the typical gear and such but also on reputations (anything from being infamous as a cold-blooded murderer to being known as the fastest blacksmith in town or a trustworthy sergent), affiliations (want to have pull with the local assassin's guild, or with the consortium of merchants?) to relationships (resented by a half-brother, friendly with a former mentor, being hunted down by a rival or former master, carrying on an affair with his lord's wife?) And for all those more minor relationships that might come up in play, there's a special mechanic called ""Circles"" which allows you to determine whom your character might know and be able to find (from a grumpy swordsman to your great-aunt the abbess). 

One of the things I think is especially neat is the system of beliefs and instincts, of which you may have three of each (unless you're a dwarf, but we'll get into racial stocks later). These could probably be borrowed and used alongside other systems too, or even in creative writing. 

Beliefs are basically some of the core ideas in your character's head that relate to the game, and should also highlight what aspects of the world you as a player are interested in exploring with this character. The best beliefs also have a goal attached to them; what the character wants to accomplish next.

Some random examples of beliefs (not meant to all be from the same character):
- Knowledge is the best way to attack any problem. I will obtain a book that has information about the dragon we're hunting at any cost.
- One should discuss one's problems rationally. I will act as a go-between to help the miners and the kobolds discover some common ground.
- Kobolds are vicious little beasties and deserve to be destroyed. I will use my skill with the sword to help the miners eliminate this kobold menace.
- The best way to serve Pelor is to follow the orders of the Patriarch. I will seek out my brother as per the Patriarch's orders.

Instincts can be revealing of character and interests of the player as well (""If the ship is sinking, make sure all the women and children are safely aboard first."" ""If the ship is sinking, get onto a lifeboat by any means possible, and don't worry about anyone else."") They can also be used to record things that the player doesn't necessarily want to have to reiterate every time because he or she feels it should be second nature to the character (""When in a dungeon, always travel at the front of the party and look for traps"" ""When in a closely confined forest or canyon, always expect an ambush""). The second sort of instincts particularly need to be specific, in order to avoid cheating by statements that are too broad (and to keep things more interesting).

I suppose I should touch on racial stock. At the moment, I only have the two basic books, though the <i>Monster Burner</i> is on its way to me, which should bring more options. In the basic books, there are four options: dwarves, elves, humans, and orcs.

Dwarves are, of course, the excellent craftsfolk and miners we have grown to know and love. In addition, they are torn between rigid cultural tradition and Greed, which is its own attribute that can influence dwarvish characters.

Elves are, on the one hand, passionately interested in the world around them and its affairs. But they are also long-lived, and see much more of the larger picture than Men and Dwarves. This leads to the elvish emotional attribute, Grief, which can eventually drive them overseas to the West or into wasting away from it.

Men are, of course, the default race. Their emotional attribute, Faith, is optional, but can allow them to perform miracles. They are also the only ones with the option of being Gifted with sorcery.

Orcs lead harsh and brutal lives, which drives them to Hatred. Actually, there's a <a href=""http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Orc_Lifepaths"">PDF with the information about Orcs available as a free sample PDF</a> from the <a href=""http://burningwheel.org/"">Burning Wheel website</a>, if anyone is interested in finding out more about the Orcs, or seeing a sample of what the Lifepaths look like.

The basic conflict resolution system uses six-sided dice, where the attribute or skill tells you how many dice you roll, and the obstacle set tells you how many successes you need to be, well, successful. If you happen to be in conflict with another character, then it becomes about who gets more successes on the relevant skill. And then there's the more complex conflicts... in what other roleplaying system is there anything resembling a Duel of Wits, where you use approximately the same moves as in a melee or other fight, and yet have such great moves as ""Obfuscate"" (for those interested in mimicking politics?) and Feint, where the only weapon is words? I haven't had a chance to see how the mechanics actually play out, having just been being by myself reading the books, but it could be a fun concept to explore at some point."

"event","It's a strange thing... I don't mind staying at home for long stretches when I know I can leave if and when I like, but it makes me a bit restless when I know I can't leave, when I'm stuck at home, particularly when everyone else is out at work or school or running errands.

For those of you who don't happen to have me as Facebook friends, or missed my status, my car's alternator is apparently not in tip-top shape. The light had been flickering on and off for some time, so Dad had obtained a voltmeter which plugs into the car's power adaptor. If I remember correctly, it should be (and was, for a while) sitting around 12-14 volts. Last Thursday, however, it went down to about 10 volts as I was driving to my latest sub job.

Since the car seemed to still be functioning all right and it wasn't dropping any lower, I kept driving to the sub job - it wasn't that far from my house, after all, and I did need to get there. I made a note to call Dad when I got home, and let him know the light had been on more constantly and that the reading now seemed to be sitting at about 10-11 volts. Maybe it was the heat, I thought; usually the light tended to act up a bit more when it was raining, but Thursday was rather hot and humid, so I thought the problem might still be weather-related.

Driving home, I noted that the number seemed to be sitting closer to 10 than 11, and then I noticed that if I turned off things that used electricty (namely, the radio, fan, and AC), the voltage was a bit higher. Gritting my teeth, I turned off both the fan and air conditioning, getting ready for a rather hot drive, especially as I didn't dare to lower the windows - usually I loved that my windows happened to be electric and thus operable with the push of a button, but I didn't want to add any extra strain on the electrical system.

Just after I passed the last good place to turn off the road before getting home, the meter's reading changed again, going from ten to nine... eight... seven... the dashboard lights indicating problems with the brakes and ABS flickered weakly on. ""Just let me get into the driveway,"" I half-ordered, half-pleaded. I started slowing down well before my driveway - I didn't know what would happen with the brakes when both those lights were on, but they seemed to work well enough when I took my time stopping. And then I had to wait for another car to pass before I could make the left into my driveway, but I made it, with the reading still at seven volts, and even managed to park in my normal spot. After which I first called Dad, leaving the engine running in case there was something I was supposed to do. He told me I could turn the car off and he would make an appointment with the mechanic ASAP. When I opened the door I realized just how hot and humid the car had gotten - the air which I considered to be hot and humid upon exiting the air-conditioned school now seemed practically air-conditioned itself by comparison.

On the bright side, my adventure and current state of car-less restlessness has brought me back to writing in this sadly neglected journal - I believe I got excited by the prospect of NaNoWriMo and the other journal I keep for my NaNo adventures and thus began to neglect this one, especially as I didn't have much exciting to write about (""Still no job... subbed today. Still no job, no subbing today, sat boringly around the house...""). Maybe I should consider combining the two?

Now that I've broken the long stretch of silence I must remember to update this journal more often. Perhaps I should put up a post about <i>Burning Wheel</i>, the newest roleplaying system to have won my interest...


ETA: I was just thinking of looking back at some of the tags in this entry to see other things that have had the same tags when the thought occurred to me - if something like this had happened as I had my permit or soon after I had gotten my license, I would have been sorely tempted to declare I was never going to drive again. At the moment, I'm thankful that Dad's driving Molly into the garage, when it's probably going to be running on just the battery (he assures me it will be able to get there even if the alternator doesn't charge the battery), but when Molly comes back I'll be glad to have a working car again and readily drive her the next day, whether to a sub job or just out somewhere."

"event","Just got back on Friday from dog-sitting for a week, which was a lot of fun. The dog was tiny (our greyhound would have eaten him in one gulp - okay, maybe two - which is why I went and stayed at the house to dog-sit rather than him coming and chilling with our family), and he was also very well-behaved. Played a lot of fetch and tug-of-war with his squeaky toys.

The coolest part, though, was that the woman for whom I was dog-sitting has a canoe, and when I asked her whether she'd mind if Brian and I took it out on the lake she said that would be fine. So we went canoeing, and then we went camooning (our new word, meaning ""canoeing by moonlight""). Camooning is amazingly serene and beautiful, especially the second day we did it, when we didn't start until a bit after eight. We found a little inlet sort of place that had a ton of fireflies in the trees and bushes, and sat and watched them for a while. And we saw heat lightning, which was a tiny bit scary but also very amazing and beautiful. We did not, however, get to meet the monster that lives in the lake which we kept joking about. But we did bring battery flashlight/lantern things which we affixed to sticks at the bow and stern, which made us feel like we looked like we knew what we were doing.

I'm also helping out with vacation bible school, my first time doing so, and it's kind of cool.

And I'm posting after a hiatus of I-don't-know-how-long, so this scattered bunch of thoughts and such will have to do for now, especially because supper is now ready. Oh, but I did start baking for the desert I'm bringing to a party tomorrow."

"event","When I agreed to preach the sermon for next Sunday (well, I had a bit more notice than a week, but anyway) I thought it would be at least kind of easy. I mean, I've been listening to sermons for a while now, I've written plenty of papers in college, and I've gotten up to speak in front of people in any number of classes and even more as a student teacher.

But then there's the aspect of this being church, and so I don't want to get any theology wrong because it's the sermon I'm preaching, and I don't want to bore people or get them upset, but at the same time I don't want to just tell them what they already know, I want to say <i>something</i>, and I want to tie all the lessons together (well, I think I've kind of gotten that bit anyway). In my first draft, I had a decent introduction and a decent rest of the sermon, but they didn't mesh well enough, and I can't decide whether and how to bring the introduction into the rest of it or to get rid of the introduction and write a new one, and what to say in a new intro if I do it that way.

Still, I will get this thing written, and if any of my real life friends want to come and watch as I attempt to preach this Sunday coming up I can give you the info. Or should I start a Facebook event so that it's actually official ;-)

Let's see, what else has been going on in my life? Taking two in person and one online course at the moment, basically to stay on the health insurance (still no job, sigh). I won't go in to the doodle I passed around in tonight's class because I've got the picture of me at least pretending to be the good choir girl as my icon (hmm, no halo, maybe I should go back and add that in...). Finished the game of Baldur's Gate 2 my friend and I were playing on his X-box, so now we've got to decide if we're going to look for the original Baldur's Gate, or to see if the third one's out, or to go back and play again as two completely different characters. I've been replaying Ocarina of Time in my free time, as well as actually watching some TV (gasp!). I blame my brother, who got me into NCIS (and my mom as well, to a lesser extent). Can't think of too much else that's interesting at the moment."

"event","It's been a long day today, part of which was getting home from class last night about 10:30 pm and having to get up at 5 am to get ready and go in to sub in a very crazy classroom, and part of which I will talk about under a cut because it's kind of sad.

<lj-cut>
When Mom and I got home from work today, we found that Chloe was no longer with us. She never seemed to be in pain, which was a good thing, and we certainly gave her a people food and attention during her last couple weeks with us to keep her happy. And she didn't have to go back to the vet, which is good because she didn't like that trip at all, and it probably would have traumatized her to have to go back and get that shot, whereas when we got home she looked very peaceful except for the fact that she was no longer breathing. And it wasn't entirely unexpected, of course, though I'll still miss her. But it wasn't as sad as it could have been.
</lj-cut>

On a totally unrelated note, but something to hopefully lighten the mood a bit, during my computer class I got bored of listening to the same lecture for the whatever-number-it-was time, so I was looking at the news headlines on Firefox to see what kinds of technology news they might have (our professor is a news junky and that class had added a bit to his beginning of the class news readings that he welcomed any of us to bring in any technology-related news we found interesting). One of the articles mentioned a website called <a href=""http://wetellstories.co.uk/"">We Tell Stories</a>, the premise of which is re-telling classic stories using various technologies, and which seems kinda cool. And through poking around I also learned about something called ARG - ""Alternate Reality Game"" - which I still don't quite ""get"" but which seems an interesting concept. Of course, I'm probably waaaay behind the times on this and probably everyone else who might read this and be interested has heard of it, but I'm used to being a little slow (or a lot slow, considering that a lot of the music I listen to was written well before this current century, or at least in a style popular well before this current century, but that's another story).

Anyway, that's enough babble for now. I'm getting sleepy and tired and stuff, which isn't surprising really, so I suppose I'd best stop typing this and go to bed or something."

"event","So I'm probably giving a sermon on April 26, for ""Passion and Purpose Sunday."" I'm honored that our priest thought of me, but also kind of terrified. I haven't officially said that I'll do it yet, because she just asked me last night and it came as a total surprise to me, but I get the sense that it's something I should do. And hope that I don't make a total fool of myself in the process :-)

Unless, of course, you go with another definition of ""total fool,"" or if I come up with something where making a total fool of myself actually supports the readings and accomplishes what a sermon should...."

"event","Thursday-Saturday I'm going to be in Wildwood, helping out with the Diocesan Convention, which should be a new and exciting experience. I've been to the Jersey shore once, briefly, to keep my mom company when she was dropping off my sister at Cape May for the diocesan youth choir camp (to which we basically forced her, practically kicking and screaming, to go - and now she can't wait for next year's). I love the ocean, but I'm not too big on crowds, or driving long distances, so unless I'm going with someone or have a purpose, I'm not likely to just go to the shore.

As for Chloe... we brought her back to the vet again, and it looks like her main problem is cancer near her digestive system. Which means we don't need to worry about Annie, which is a good thing. Chloe also got a couple shots at the vet, one to treat the minor infection she had and one of vitamin B (she was slightly anemic, and it helps with digestion). Since then, she's been coming out a bit more often and had a bit more of an appetite, though still not back up to full. But she seems happy enough, and that's what the vet told us to do - keep Chloe happy - so we'll do that, and see if she manages to gain some of her weight back.

So yeah, those are the two big things at the moment, and now I have to run off to work (I'm subbing at the preschool aftercare today)."

"event","At the moment there's two major things (besides the job thing) that I'm worried about - my laptop and Chloe, the cat who ended up being mine even though I didn't want a cat at first. I'll go into the story of the laptop first, mostly because it's more of an annoyance sort of thing and not as likely to upset people, and then I'll cut the part about my cat in case people don't want to see it.

As far as the laptop goes - today, all of a sudden, the screen went a bit darker and it showed that the laptop was not on AC power, even though the cord was plugged in. No matter what I did - readjusting the angle, plugging the cord into different outlets, turning off the computer - nothing seemed to make a connection. It's kind of what happened with my Dell, except that was more gradual and this was just poof, it's not working. I'd rather have gradual; that way I could've prepared. I need to figure out how to get it fixed, and how to afford it, and yeah.

<lj-cut text=""And now for the cat..."">
And now for the cat. Chloe's been losing weight recently. At first, no big deal, she could use to lose a bit of fat, she was a pudgy kitty. Then it kept happening. And happening. Last time she went to the vet she was over ten pounds, now she's under five, and all skin and bones. We're not sure what it is yet; the vet took blood and urine to test, but it doesn't look good. We think she might've caught something from the outdoor cats, the day she escaped outside and spent the day out there. So yeah, I'm not sure what's going to happen with her and it's kind of... she ended up sleeping in my room when she was the ""extra"" we brought home from the animal shelter, and she and I ended up bonding. Yes, I spoiled her rotten, and she was a wicked cat and annoyed me sometimes, but she's got all these traces of the little mouse-bait kitten with the motorboat purr in her. So yeah, that's the story so far.

</lj-cut>

Let's see, something cheerful to end the entry on, something cheerful - ah, I know. My temperature was normal the last time I took it, so hopefully I'm finishing up being sick (my whole family had and has fevers and congestion). Oh, and Lily (my brother's greyhound) is curled up on the chair where I'm going to sit once I finish typing this on the family desktop, and she's very cute. No, I won't make her get up - I'll just make her share. Which she should do because I was sitting in that chair when she first got up on it, so there.

EDIT: Update on the laptop: Dad looked at it, played around with the cord and the port and his digital multimeter (DMM), and thinks that the problem is in cord right before where it plugs in to the laptop. Hopefully that's it, because there were replacements for sale on ebay and he bought one of those (as he has the ebay account and I don't, though I fully intend to pay him back for it). So yeah, fingers crossed that that fixes it and that's one less thing to worry about..."

"event","At one point in time, I ordered something from Paizo.com - I believe it was the DVD of <i>The Gamers</i>. This has the effect that I am on the Paizo mailing list, though usually I just kind of skip over those entries (""Oh yeah, another mass mailing""), but recently one of them caught my eye, a news bulletin about 17 finalists advancing to <a href=""http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/rpgSuperstar"">RPG Superstar: Round 3</a>. It seems that RPG Superstar is something like American Idol or Top Chef, except it's all done via online posts and a discussion board sort of format, and instead of singing or cooking the designers are developing new content for use with Paizo's Pathfinder setting. I've been enjoying reading through some of the entries and the comments, <s>including during my computer class when our group was done with our presentation and rehearsed and other groups still couldn't decide what they wanted their first slides to look like</s>, and I thought I'd take a break to share the link with the rest of you, because it seems like something others might enjoy as well.

Also, Pathfinder looks like it might be worth checking out. I downloaded the <a href=""http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy84o0"">Pathfinder Beta PDF</a> which contains the rules (free if you create a Paizo.com account, and since I already have one...). It's based on the 3.5 OGL, but does have some new rules to try and make classes more interesting and/or versatile, as well as a new setting to replace the copyrighted Greyhawk material. Most of the setting isn't really detailed too much in the document - the part I noticed the most was the deities in the cleric section, but I haven't given the system a really close read-through so there could be other information as well."

"event","I kind of wish the snow would cancel evening classes. Not that I really mind being there, but I don't look forward to driving back at ten-something at night in the dark and ice...

I don't know if I've mentioned my Tuesday night class before. It's Intro to Computers, which I'm only taking so I can possibly take a networking course later on. The first two weeks thus far have mostly been ""You should work with people from all different generations, look at the different generations here"" and ""Yay education"" and ""Yay Obama."" At the very end of the last class we did finally talk a bit about computers, when the professor asked us to get into groups and answer the question ""Why did technology develop so quickly from the main frame to the Blackberry (or Obamaberry, as he is so fond of calling it)?"" The other groups had answers like, ""Because it could"" or ""Because there was demand,"" while my group's answer involved semiconducters, transistors, and integrated circuits.

Anyway, I think I'll try and prove I know how to use Word by not using Word but using OpenOffice instead - mainly because it happens to be free and have a small-sized version that's on my flash drive. Did I mention that we're working out of the books for Office '03?"

"event","I get to play in Saltmarsh today, which should be a lot of fun. The DM told me, ""You guys are so screwed."" To which I replied, ""I'm quite used to it; I played in your other campaign, remember?"" I kind of know what's happening, as the other campaign took place AFTER these events and some of the other characters went through this, and were talking about it. But my character has no idea, and I'm working hard to divide my character knowledge from player knowledge. Especially as I'm familiar with the main villian from the other game, and wrote him a couple songs as Zefiryn, which I kept finding stuck in my head as we were fighting him. So I figured I'd better write him something as my other character, Rona, so now I've got a ballad-ish thing to hand to the DM, who will doubtless be amused that I wrote another one. You know, Rona's probably going to have to write a ballad for TimJim as well, when we finally meet him. I should probably write ballads for a couple of the other PCs too...

And speaking of creative works, I probably could use an icon of Rona to put up there as opposed to one of Solaya. At least Solaya's got that right, slightly-worried expression that goes along with ""You guys are so screwed."" But she's more martial than Rona, who's a bardic priestess of Lydia (pure bard as far as class goes, but she considers her bardic magic to come from Lydia, who is a neutral good Suel goddess of Song, Knowledge, and Sunlight in the Greyhawk setting). I should do an icon with Melanna, too, but she's harder to think of distinguishing characteristics for - I'm not quite sure yet how to do an OOtS-style stack of books. Hmm, maybe I should do her talking to some amorphous bug-creature....

EDIT: Rona is now my default gaming icon. If you want to see worried-Solaya, check out my user pics, or there might be an older post about Solaya specifically."

"event","All Saints Sunday today, and we had our service in the Memorial Garden, and sang ""I sing a song of the saints of God,"" which is one of my favorite November hymns and worked its way into my NaNo last year in a very subtle way. I'm not sure how our church's view on saints fits into the continuum, but during the adult formation program there was one member who talked about being taught ""Saints with a big S"" and ""saints with a little s,"" the first being those canonized by the church and the second being the people around us in our everyday lives. The hymn's about the second sort, I think.

Our church's annual roast beef dinner is coming up on Saturday, November 15, if anyone is interested. I believe tickets are $12 or $12.50 a person, though the rates aren't in the announcements - the times are, though (4:30-7pm). Anyone's welcome, it's good food. Call or IM me if you want details or anything. I'll stop using LJ as an advertising space now ^_^"

"event","Much as I am annoyed by my Chloe at times, there's still some fondness there - she's still part of the family, bratty as she can be when she puts her devious feline mind to it. She's also very good at hiding - okay, normally, but when she somehow slips outdoors and it's dark out, with her black fur and being spooked by the strays outside - yeah.

So I'm more than a little worried about her, especially as it's getting cold out. But it's too dark to look for her properly, especially as she's hiding and running away from us. So the plan is to wait 'til morning and then maybe we'll be able to see her. I'm hoping she gets back to us safe, and maybe a bit more appreciative of what a good life she's got inside with us, the heat, and the neverending supply of food. Of course, we've had her since she was a ""mouse bait"" kitten and she hasn't been outside all that time, so I don't know that she has a proper set of ""outside kitty"" instincts.

I suppose the thing to do is wait until tomorrow and see what happens.


EDIT: At around 11:20something, as I was getting ready to go to bed, I got an intuition that I should go check in the garage (we left the door from the outside to the garage open so that if Chloe wanted to, she could at least find some kind of shelter in the garage). Lo and behold, there is my wicked little scamp, perched atop some shelving and looking like she is the Queen of the Universe! Of course, she then spoils the effect by making a piteous mew, ""Oh woe is me and all that I have suffered"" sort of attitude - comes inside and it's straight to the food bowl. With a detour on the way because she is still quite nervous around the canines of this house. Still, she's back safe, and I'm glad of that!"

I don't remember going on a website with art, but it is kinda pretty I guess, in a weird sort of way, and I kinda like those lines that look like a web... wait a minute, that isn't a website, that's my word processor... oh crap...""

Nothing else seemed to be affected, and it was kind of pretty - and also kind of in the way of seeing things on the screen. So I brought it into Best Buy today, where yay for me, I bought the year's worth of accident insurance against what I thought my dad would advise. So it's getting fixed now, no problem, the staff was really awesome about it and didn't even make fun of me or anything, and even though I didn't bring the receipt they had my information in the computer and were able to print another one for me. The downside is that I've got two weeks of no laptop in which I have to fight for a family computer, use a computer elsewhere, or use my old desktop (which still works, even though it makes what I consider to be unhealthy sounds from somewhere in the tower, particularly if kept on for a while) - but the upside is that my laptop is getting fixed, and I don't have to pay any more than I've already paid for insurance. This is a point in favor of possibly getting the couple extra years added to the thing, even if the total price of insurance does end up being almost halfway to a new laptop (we'll see; I still have time to consider my options).

So yes, that (and trying to find my way out of the Best Buy parking lot) was my excitement of the week. I did snap a picture with my camera phone of the screen if anyone's interested in seeing what it looked like broken. Oh yes, and I did remember to put my documents and such onto DVD disks in case they ended up wiping my hard drive or giving me a new machine, and the programs I really care about are all (legally) available free on the 'net, so it's cool."

It's been a busy summer, nothing too noteworthy happening, just a lot of working and no vacation or anything, which got to be just a tad exhausting. I really meant to do better at keeping in touch with people over the summer and maybe even have some free time - perhaps next year? However, summer's over now, and it's back to taking random courses to stay on the health insurance as I sub and look for a job. Actually, I'm kinda looking forward to taking creative writing, and Spanish should be useful, so that's good anyway. And Spanish is Saturday mornings, so maybe I'll be able to hang out with people in the some afternoon.

In other news, I've finished all the Phoenix Wright games currently out - now it's just time to wait for Perfect Prosecutor. In the meantime, I'm going to save up for a Wii.

We still have a stray cat and three stray kittens outside, and they tend to get in the way when we're trying to park the cars, silly things. At least they're cute?"

"event","So I haven't written an update on my life in a while. I've gone from chasing high schoolers down to get papers and such to chasing two year olds around to get them to stop strangling each other, which has kept me relatively busy. However, I have managed to acquire the two Phoenix Wright games I hadn't played, and I'm slowly working through the second one in the bits of spare time I have so that I can move on to the fourth game and then be ready when ""Perfect Prosecutor"" comes out (I love my DS).

We've got a stray cat living in our backyard <lj-cut text=""and wow can I babble on about her, apparently...""> who looks almost like my Chloe but she's much much skinnier and has yellow eyes and three kittens (despite not being far from kittenhood herself, poor thing). My sister has dubbed her ""Alice,"" after Alice Cullen from the <i>Twilight</i> series (yes, my younger sister is into that series and vampires in general, I don't know what I did to end up with an emo/punk/whatever she is for a sister, but there it is). I tend to call her ""Alley Cat,"" which is perhaps a bit dorky but she'll respond to just about anything if I'm holding a can of food or cat treats, or she thinks there's a possibility that I may at some point in the near future be in the very general vicinity of food or treats. If I could afford the vet bills and whatnot, and wasn't living in the same house as my brother's cat, then I would be very tempted to take her in, and possibly one or more of the kittens as well. She's quite friendly and self-confident, and willingly lets any and all of us pet and fuss over her, despite being out and about in the wilds. The kittens are less sure, I've only been able to pet one of them so far, and I'm the only one who's gotten to pet a kitten so far. Anyway, there's a distinct possibility that we'll end up catching them and turning them in to a shelter or something. I don't mind quite so much with the kittens - possibly because I haven't seen as much of them and possibly because none of them seem to share Ally's quite friendly temperment - but I hate to do that to Ally. I know cats have a tougher time finding a forever home than kittens, and I know Ally has a good temperment with our dogs (not scared of them and not bullying towards them, they're just kind of there), but when Annie sees her through the window she goes into vicious attack cat mode, and I have the marks on my arm to prove it. So I'm not entirely sure what will happen with them, but that's at least a bit of a story for those who feel like they have been sorely deprived of my chattery entries. </lj-cut>

Other than that, it feels like there's just been a lot going on, but not much of it worthy or tending towards the genre of LJ entries. Perhaps I shall think of something else soon, but for now I think I shall conclude this entry.

EDIT: No wait, one more thing, I got a paper in the mail for jury duty, where I had to fill out a paper and then I'm on-call for a couple days and might have to go in and might have to be on a jury and that makes me just a smidge nervous because it's okay in video games and such to be all ""this person's innocent and it was really that person"" and what not, but to be part of that in real life... then again, maybe it'll turn out that I'm not needed, or maybe it will be more interesting than scary, I don't know...."

Anyway, busy busy week with finals and flea market and subbing, but I just emailed my last two papers off for my theatre course, so now all that's left to do is sit back and fret about what grades I'll get. Wait, I don't have to do that because I'm only taking these courses for my amusement/to stay on health insurance, so the grades don't matter so much any more - yay! I still prefer getting decent grades, though - I think it's my perfectionistic streak.

I've noticed a tendency to overuse the word ""anyway"" as a segue. I'm going to have to break myself of the habit, methinks.

Tomorrow's Pentecost, which in a liturgical sense is the day we celebrate the Holy Spirit coming to the disciples - tongues of fire, speaking in tongues, the whole bit. In a celebratory sense, it's the birthday of the church, so we all have birthday cake. There's a cake for each month, and people sit at the table assigned to them by birth month, and we just generally have a good time. And there's cake. It's yummy. I like to eat cake.

<lj-cut>
Dad... he's hard. Probably on the lawful side of neutral good, and probably either an expert or a wizard. Mom I can see as a multiclass cleric (Episcopalian)/bard, though she's not quite so musical as some of the family, and she's almost certainly NG. The brother who's next after me would have to be a bard, that's it, end of story - I think I'd tend to place him as closer to CN. The other brother needs some bard to explain his singing skills, but I think he's probably also got levels in a fighting class, either monk or fighter - he's probably NN/CG. My sister's a bit CN, except when she's CG, and certainly has the bardic singing ability, though with her skateboarding and physical feats of flexibility I suspect she might be hiding a couple levels of rogue in there as well.

<b>Step One.</b> Make a list of twelve characters, numbered one through twelve. Save this list in a safe place - don't post it yet.

<b>Step Two.</b> Post this MEME on your journal and give your friends the opportunity to ask questions about the characters, using the numbers and not knowing which number stands for which character. (Example: Would Three rather be stuck on a desert island with Two or Seven)?

<b>Step Three.</b> Post another entry with the list of characters and answers to your friends' questions!


I think originally this was done with fandom characters, but I've listed roleplaying characters instead, keeping this a rolepaying-MEME sort of entry. So go ahead, ask me whateever you like about my roleplaying characters, as many questions as you like (though I can't guarantee a single answers post if people get too enthusiastic)."

"event","Happy Easter to those of you who celebrate! I was going to make a post earlier, on Friday, talking about some of the celebrations, but then I caught the post <lj user=""wolviepris""> made about the LJ strike in time to avoid typing out the post. Anyway, what I basically wanted to say then was that the Passion Gospel is so much more amazing when chanted! Longer? Yes, probably - but well worth it, especially when you have three guys with musical backgrounds and superb voices chanting it. Our choir director threatened us with the possibility of doing it in four parts with the choir next year. I love our new organist - he was the one that suggested doing the chant this year, and did the narrator's part, and he's also written out a couple of other chants for us to do at different parts of the year.

Sleepovers can be quite exciting and exhausting. I chaperoned for the Maundy Thursday sleepover. I said I was going to get a few hours of sleep and didn't. Most of the girls said they were going to stay up all night and fell asleep a bit after 5 am. We played all sorts of games - Yahtzee, Loaded Questions, Apples to Apples, Would You Rather, etc. Yahtzee seemed to be the one that was going for the longest amount of time, probably because one of the other chaperones was running it consistently and it was new to a lot of the kids. I've played it before and enjoyed it. Maybe I'll see if there's Yahtzee available for my new phone when it comes - I like buying one or two permanent games for the phone to give me something to do if I'm in a boring situation and want to fiddle with something.

I also learned a bit of flower decorating. Always fun to learn new things. Asparagus fern has little tiny thorns. They don't really hurt but can be annoying if they get stuck in your skin when your hands are too full to get them out. That's what they made teamwork for. Tulips don't do so well if the fridge is too cold and the water they're standing in freezes. The part of lily flowers that causes allergies are the yellow things inside the flower. They can stain your hands when you take them out, but the stains will wash off soon enough if you wash your hands regularly.

And I'll stop before I get too rambly. I still haven't quite caught up on sleep and things."

<b>Constitution-</b>10<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>16<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>15<br>

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. However, neutral good can be a dangerous alignment because because it advances mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are skilled stalkers and hunters who make their home in the woods. Their martial skill is nearly the equal of the fighter, but they lack the latter's dedication to the craft of fighting. Instead, the ranger focuses his skills and training on a specific enemy a type of creature he bears a vengeful grudge against and hunts above all others. Rangers often accept the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. His skills allow him to move quietly and stick to the shadows, especially in natural settings, and he also has special knowledge of certain types of creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw on natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does, and like a druid he is often accompanied by animal companions. A ranger's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that he can cast.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Clerics</b> act as intermediaries between the earthly and the divine (or infernal) worlds. A good cleric helps those in need, while an evil cleric seeks to spread his patron's vision of evil across the world. All clerics can heal wounds and bring people back from the brink of death, and powerful clerics can even raise the dead. Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains. These domains grants the cleric special powers, and give him access to spells that he might otherwise never learn. A cleric's Wisdom score should be high, since this determines the maximum spell level that he can cast.

"event","Written in response to <lj user=""wolviepris"">'s request: <i>After playing D&D with you for years, I want to see you write a roleplaying post. Favorite games, characters, fluff and crunch bits too. Bonus points for some stories before you met us.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Warning: Long Post Ahead"">
Besides the obvious playing ""Let's Pretend"" while growing up, I believe I first learned about roleplaying from an odd book of my mother's, <i>Bimbos of the Death Sun</i>, in which the narrator gets drafted into running a roleplaying game. I was immediately intrigued by the idea. After years of playing graphics computer games where I would start grumbling at the screen, ""Come on, there's a rope there, why won't you let me do anything with it?"" when the rope was only background scenery, I was definitely ready for a game where there was another person present who could make adjustments for those who thought of alternative solutions to the one presented in the game and move the story forward that way. I asked Mom if she'd ever heard of roleplaying games and how one might go about getting into them, and she replied that she had played in college and entrusted her battered old copy of the first edition player's handbook for D&D to me.

I scanned the book with great interest, and started thinking about how the gameplay might work. I don't remember how old I was exactly, but I wasn't in eighth grade yet, and had come from playing text-based adventure games and other adventure games with different ""screens"" for each scene. The first thing I created with the idea that possibly I might run it some day reflected that, being a piece of graph paper labelled with various things. There were acorn trees where one had an x percent chance of finding gold in the acorns (I think that was from one of the King's Quest games), holly which had the possibility of having rubies in it, and if I had any NPCs I'm almost certain they were typical of shopkeepers in videogame tropes, with no purpose other than to sit around selling things and paying money for things the players had found in their adventures. I don't even think i had anything for the potential players to fight, lacking a monster manual.

Then we moved, and happened to wander into a certain hobby store, back before it fell into the hands of another management and lost everything about it that had once drawn me there (but that was years later, and we're still back in the summer after we moved). Mom noticed a signup to learn to play D&D, and asked my brother and myself if we wanted her to sign us up. We both said ""Yes,"" though mine was more exuberant and was followed by a few weeks of me constantly asking Mom when she thought the game would start (we'd signed up with our phone numbers and the days/times we could play) before finally getting the phone call and going to my first D&D game.

It was second edition, and Brian brought along a couple copies of the PHB for us to share, so we didn't need our own books. Mom bought us both dice - I got black ones that were almost clear - and we started making our characters at level zero, with the instructions to think of their profession when choosing skills. I made a half-elf, Danya, and because of the 18 I'd rolled for intelligence, I decided to make her a linguist (at the DM's suggestion), and chose to spend all my non-weapon proficiency slots on languages. Our characters were all out of work, and followed a man to the docks when he offered work, whereupon we were kidnapped by slavers. After a shipwreck and some exploring around an island, we found a statue of Ehlonna who became our patron deity, and were shortly afterward granted first level and our classes. Brian made suggestions based on our play style, and was rather befuddled when a couple people insisted on being classes towards which they had not roleplayed a tendency. We had a would-be bard who had never sung a song, told a tale, or attempted to inspire his allies, and a would-be druid who had not paid much attention to the natural surroundings or to attempts at balance to this point. I was on the opposite end of the spectrum - I was happy enough to be playing that I didn't care what class I was, and was told to choose between cleric and mage but wasn't sure which to pick. That was how my first character ended up being a multiclassed cleric/mage in service of Ehlonna.

I miss parts of second edition. One of the odd little ""crunchy bits"" I miss is that when you rolled skill checks (though skills were called non-weapon proficiencies back then), you wanted to roll low and not high. This meant that as you were traipsing merrily along, the DM could say, ""Roll a d20, just for kicks,"" and when you rolled a 20 it wasn't just that you weren't sure if you really were rolling it just for kicks and it didn't matter or you did really well, but it could also mean you just did really, really poorly.

There weren't ranks of skill in second edition, either, at least not in the standard version. In the campaign I played in that ran for over two years, after the DM killed off our characters and resurrected them, we had the option of using two non-weapon proficiency slots to have knowledge that approached sage knowledge, or four slots to have knowledge that was sage knowledge. That was a special house rule, though, so generally either you knew something about a thing or you didn't.

And you had THAC0, which could be crazy. THAC0 stands for ""to hit armor class 0,"" and involves a bit more caluculation to find out whether or not you can hit a thing. It starts out at 20 and goes down. Armor class starts out at 10 and goes down - so negative armor class was a good thing in those games.

Mostly, though, I'm not as much into the ""crunchy bits"" of a game as I am into the characters and story. When I played in a high-level game once, combat started to bore me because of all the numbers we had to crunch. Give me a good old session without a single dice rolled any day!

I don't think I really have a preference for which edition of D&D to play when given 2nd, 3rd, and 3.5, especially if the second edition game allows for the use of ""kits"" from the supplement books, which offers a lot more flexibility in character creation (and the bardic handbook is one of my favorite books ever, and is where I got the idea for Melanna to trade down to a wizard's BAB in exchange for extra skill points, which is why I was able to be little miss know-it-all in <lj user=""baridmerlin"">'s most recent game that I played in). I'm rather partial to GURPS, as it allows for more flexibility in character concept and such, though sometimes character creation can get a bit crunch-heavy, especially if one is DMing and has a whole cast of NPCs to create.

And then again, one can sometimes misread the rules in GURPS, as in the case of ""the rat who would not die.""

If I am remembering properly (it has been some time since I last cracked open the basic GURPS books and looked at the combat rules, having busied myself instead with the myriad of fascinating cultural notes in GURPS supplement books), there are two scores for health given for some GURPS creatures. Among these creatures is a rat, which has a score something like 5/17. The 5 is supposed to be hit points, and when a creature or character reaches 0 hit points, they have to start rolling against one of the scores to avoid going unconscious/dying. When a GURPS being reaches negative five times their health, they are dead. The second number, 17, is there because of the high resistance to disease rats have, and is the number to roll against to see if the rat can resist a disease.

So our first GURPS party is strolling along the maze filled with deadly creatures and traps set for us, hoping that we will be able to escape with our lives and win our freedom from slavery, when along comes a large rat looking for some adventurers to munch. We fight. And fight. And fight some more. Even the DM is starting to get frustrated with the rat - ""You're just a stupid rat, why won't you die already, darn you?"" - until we beat the rat down to negative 17 times 5 hit points. It was only later that we realized the purpose of the different scores, and the rat-who-would-not-die was already practically legend.

Most of my gaming has been in D&D and GURPS, but I've also tried Star Wars. I started out with an introductory set to the West End Games version of Star Wars, GMing for my family, which was kind of cool because we were actually sitting around doing something together, though I was somewhat inept at GMing and the sophistication level wasn't helped by the fact that my much younger sister was also playing, or that we only had the introductory level materials. Later on, I did purchase d20 Star Wars, but by then my family had lost interest in playing, for the most part.

During that summer before eighth grade when I first started D&D, I also got involved an <a href=""http://geocities.com/star_wars_chat/index.html"">online chat-based Star Wars roleplay</a>, which was a great way to waste time instead of doing boring old homework. I played two different characters depending on my mood at the time. Neither one would participate in combat, short of hiding under tables or trying to heal the fallen participants, as I wasn't quite confident in my ability to portray the combat realistically. Both my brothers were also involved on this board, and one of them was enough into strategy games that he wasn't shy about leading theoretical fleets into battle while my young Padawan ordered ice cream sundaes and hung out with the misfits at the cantina. There were several people who came on and were interested in roleplaying things besides pure Star Wars, and I would roleplay with them as well, so long as it wasn't annoying any of the other regulars. Eventually, though, life got too busy for me to be on their as regularly, and I think the same thing happened to a lot of the ""regulars,"" so I think the chat's mostly a dead zone now.

That chat was what gave me the idea for a forum-based roleplay, though, and we tried playing a D&D roleplay with Brian as the DM. I really wish I could link to that board, but ezboard had some sort of bug and lost all posts, so it's no longer there. Still, it was a good time. We had an OOC board where we joked to the point that my paladin was busily denying she was a drug dealer (methinks the lady doth protest overmuch), and we had an IC board with two different groups at two different inns. Brian taught us a new system of rolling that basically involved us picking our own random numbers, and he would randomly generate a number to be one and then decide what we had rolled based on that number. Of course, there were times when we fudged a little bit, carefully distributing our ""random"" numbers so that we were sure of <i>someone</i> getting a success....

My brothers were both playing in that game, and both of their characters had connections to my character, which actually formed the link between the two groups at the different inns. Unfortunately, one of my brothers played his neutral good druid as lawful anal, and go very uppity with the council for wanting us to pretend we'd gone into a supposedly haunted house and found no treasure when he thought we should actually check it out and make sure there was nothing dangerous in there. All the other characters, even my paladin, realized that the best thing to do would be to nod and smile at the council and then go in anyway, but the druid threatened the council and was so generally uppity with them that he got the whole lot of us in trouble. We ended that game with a BANG when one of the characters (Maynard the Mouse, a cowardly wizard) decided he'd had enough and didn't want to face what the council was planning for us, took a wand of fireballs out of his robe, and set it off at point-blank range, killing the whole party. Still, I think the message board format can be kind of neat when you've got people with similar mindsets playing.

I've also played a bit of d20 modern. I kind of like the concept, but I'm not as big a fan of the specific rules - I'd rather play it as a GURPS game than a d20 game, I think. Brian and I were both players, and spent the whole time wondering OOC when we would get to cast spells. Genre-wise, I'd rather play medieval-ish fantasy, or perhaps space opera, though it is kind of cool playing in a pseudo-modern world if you at least get to have some extraordinary powers (such as in the superheroes GURPS campaign that <lj user=""wolviepris"">, whom I blame for this extraordinarily long post, ran with us as characters).

Setting-wise, I tend to be partial to Greyhawk, perhaps because that was the setting for one of the longest campaigns in which I played. I played Ravenloft once. That was kind of a bad idea. My character's frugality (""Let's save this knock scroll for later in case we need it, and go investigate that room with the rustling noises instead"") ended up in a TPK (total party kill). Oops.

I think one of my favorite characters I've played is Zefiryn, partially because of the length of that campaign. It was because of that game that I got email and AIM, as you could probably tell by my chosen account names. Zefiryn started out as Mistress Zefiryn Mylonas of Celene, youngest daughter of Lord Aralt Mylonas (an Oeridian) and Lady Castalia Mylonas (a gray elf), student of her mother's brother Silas Eveningstar, and would-be adventurer. When the time came close for her to be married, she went to her father and begged for a chance to live out the adventures in the tales she had come to love, and he granted her what she asked and sent her on her way with a sword bearing the crest of their family and an injunction to be careful. She travelled out of Celene and headed towards Greyhawk, certain the capital of the world would hold excitment for her. On the way, she sang for her room and board, and sang for coins.

On the day of the first game, each player was taken aside seperately for a one-on-one session with the DM, during which he added to the backstories we had given him just how the character had ended up in the specific town where we were starting, and then roleplayed a bit with us in the town. Zefiryn was approached by a man who introduced himself as ""Sturm,"" and who recognized the Mylonas crest on her shortsword. He offered her a chance at adventure, asking her to meet him at a certain inn that night.

After everyone had been introduced, Brian told us, ""All right. Clear off the table."" Puzzled, we obeyed him, putting away dice, books, and character sheets. Then he described the inn to us, and a friend of his brought out a chicken and some other food, and we ate the meal in character and then signed the adventuring contract, despite not knowing Sturm's specific goals.

There's really too much to put all the stories of our adventures into a single LJ post, but I'll tell a couple more. One of our first combats was against a fog monster. You've never heard of a fog monster? That's all right, neither had I, but I was new enough to roleplaying to not even know what a kobold was, so that didn't bother me. I was a bit puzzled as to why, after he had rolled my knowledge, the DM was cracking up, but I was still very new to everything and took everything quite seriously. So I dutifully relayed my character's observation that we were fighting a fog monster, which could only be hit by magical weapons, and did anyone have a magical weapon or should we retreat, or maybe our wizard could try a spell or two?

We killed the fog monster without the aid of a magical weapon, and the experienced gamers recognized the corpse instantly as a kobold. I believe one of the other characters told mine to keep such ""useful information"" as the fog monster to myself from now on when we were involved in combat... eventually I did realize my mistake, but it did take me a while. Still, I did have Zefiryn write up an essay on the fog monster, which disguises itself as a kobold and conjures for itself a concealing fog to hide it from possible predators and prey alike, and posted it on the OOC board that I mentioned earlier in this post (yes, we had accounts for our characters from the other game, too, just because it was too much fun not to).

There's plenty of other stories featuring Zefiryn, who was also known as Lady Zefiryn Mylonas, Order of the Phoenix (this was before the title for Rowling's book came out, for the record, and had nothing to do with a secret order and everything to do with the fact that we had died horribly on a mission for Furyondy only to be brought back by the healing power of the phoenix, who left a glowing phoenix tattoo on each of our hands), and as Viscountess Zefiryn Lindros of Verbobonc. In an alternate timeline (okay, so our games have been really screwed up), she was also known as Duchess Zefiryn Tinneman of Furyondy, after she had been shaken up enough by her adventures to let her parents marry her however they wished. She met Duke Benal Tynneman again after remembering the divergence of the timeline, and decided he was really kind of a sleazeball and she would rather stay with her adventuring companions, as she had a committment to them and to the phoenix who had restored her life (Duke Benal Tynneman couldn't understand this, and presumed to speak for the phoenix, which is what really made Zefiryn decide that it wouldn't be a good idea to be stuck with him for life).

Unfortunately, the game got a bit too intense for some of the players (I personally don't mind Brian's philosophy of as soon playing something where the characters' lives suck so yours looks so much better in comparison, but a few of the players were invested in their characters and had enough bad stuff happen to the characters that the game wasn't being fun anymore), so we brought the game to an ending. Later, I found out that the plan for Lady Zefiryn was not to have made her Viscountess, but rather to have made her Queen of Furyondy at the end, after even more bad stuff had happened. That would have been cool, but she does like the Viscount of Verbobonc, too, and he certainly does need a bit of help in managing affairs of state as he wasn't raised for it in the same way she was.

Anyway, several of the people from that game eventually moved on to play in a GURPS campaign which Brian also ran, and I was rather fond of that character as well. Aerynala Nyssar, who tended to give her name simply as Aeryn, came from an impoverished noble house with few friends. She had sold herself into slavery in order to get money for healing that her youngest brother desperately needed. The interesting thing about Aeryn was that, even though she was a GURPS character, she had a lot of bardic qualities about her - yes, by then I had decided on a favorite class, and it was bard.

I don't always play bards, though. I made a rogue once, for a game that never got off the ground, but I took the basic idea for the character and turned her into Syreth, Celara's wizard cohort in Barb's game. And then there was Solaya, innkeeper's daughter and paladin of Pelor, who began life on the forum game and moved to being a main character in one of Brian's games, where she proceeded to be the only one (despite having only a 13 strength) who could open a certain bottle that released an evil djinn, and then she immediately lost her paladinhood over the whole matter and tried to hide it from the group for several sessions in fear that they would desert her and she would be alone in recapturing the djinn. She had already seen the error of acting alone from arrogance vividly displayed in the corpse of her older brother, who had also trained as a paladin. She spent a good deal of the game being miserable because of a cold she had caught (no paladinhood = no resistance to disease), and so not as helpful as she possibly could have been (which translates to, I had played the same module once before with the same DM, so I was trying very hard not to metagame and to let the other players figure things out whenever possible). She's also the subject of my current gaming icon, in the style of <a href=""http://geocities.com/star_wars_chat/index.html""> Order of the Stick</a>, which is my favorite gaming comic and the only one I read regularly.

Favorite characters that other people play? Let's see - there's TimJim of course. He's a forty-year-old gnome, which translates to about a ten-year-old human, and is an illusionist/thief or illusionist/rogue depending on the edition. He tends to get himself in all sorts of trouble with his low wisdom, and speaks with an adorable lisp, and has no qualms about almost anything, as he is a ""gweat and powewfuw wizawd"" and ready for anything that might come his way. He's not allowed to play with sharp objects, so his weapon of choice is a frying pan - also great for cooking up a bit of breakfast now and then. At one point he did have a +1 frying pan, possibly as a result from his playing with a Deck of Many Things (by which he also earned the enmity of Lloth, which proved to be the reason that Zefiryn went to the Abyss to confront Lloth with the rest of the group despite being quite terrified of spiders and things). I actually wrote a song for him - I told Brian my character was writing him a song, and (knowing my occasional tendancy to go above and beyond) casually asked if I'd actually written one. I admitted that I didn't have one to hand, but then that week I played around in Finale and with my rhyming dictionary, and the next game I utterly astounded him by having both words <i>and</i> music for ""The TimJim Song."" Of course, I think Zefiryn created a bit of a monster there, as now TimJim will occasionally be heard singing the song to himself, and I think it's inflated his already overlarge ego - but I'm fond of him, what can I say?

Another beloved NPC in that game was Merrick. He started out as squire to Bivianian (our paladin/doctor) when his farmer father begged that Bivinian accept Merrick as squire and offered him what probably amounted to the farmer's life savings, though it wasn't much as far as adventuring pay goes. We soon discovered that Merrick was used to being bossed around and generally ignored, and that part of him had quite a poetic soul and wanted to be a bit more of a bard, but he was afraid to admit it and much more comfortable hiding behind the role of squire. Bivinian didn't allow that, though - he kept asking Merrick what he wanted to do, and telling him things like, ""No, you don't need to clean my armor, I can do it myself,"" which completely baffled the poor boy.

The whole group adopted Merrick, though he got closest to Graelin, the steel dragon whom Bivinian had inadvertantly called as his warhorse. Graelin eventually left in order to give Bivinian the chance to bond with Merrick, fearing that he was in the way of a bond forming between paladin and squire. Merrick was, of course, devastated that his closest friend had left.

Zefiryn's part with Merrick was to teach him about music and poetry, lessons he looked forward to but was afraid to accept until she explained that it was common for nobility of any sort to have experience in those fields, and that even though he might play an instrument, write poems, sing songs, that did not mean that he could not follow the path of a paladin.

Although Merrick was 0-level as the rogues were pushing the double digits (this was second edition, where classes advanced at different rates), a lot of luck with the dice made him a valueable, contributing member of the party even in combat, with his bow and arrows and tendancy to roll natural 20s (a good thing in second edition combat, unlike second edition skills). When he was killed by an efrit, there was a whole minute of dead, shocked silence around the table, that was how invested the party had been in taking care of Merrick.

There are other great characters, of course, like <lj user=""baridmerlin"">'s NPCs Tajlo (did I spell that right) and Rumplebelly, and <lj user=""wolviepris"">'s PCs Sanjuro and Gersh, but I think I won't get into them at the moment because this entry is already getting a bit long and the people reading this are more likely to have experience with these character than any from Brian's games.

Oh, and speaking of Brian's games, there was a one-shot I played in once, on my birthday, with a friend from my French class. She was very new to the game, and played a pregenerated thief character. There was a burning house with a woman at the top, holding a baby and screaming for someone to help her, before the party had been put together as a group. She used her ability to climb walls and got up to the woman and baby, and the DM asked her, ""What does your character do next?""

""She's a thief, right?""

""Right...""

""So I guess she steals the baby.""

New players can be quite fun ^_^


Speaking of new things, I also have a small list of new things that could be fun to try in gaming, at some point. I recently obtained, from rpgnow.com, a PDF copy of the roleplaying game based on George RR Martin's (lj user=""grrm""<i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series, specifically the first book, <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, which I think could be fun to try sometime, though I don't feel confident enough to act as GM for it. I also have another game, <i>Pendragon</i>, that I got when I thought I might be doing a paper on roleplaying theory and interactivity and wanted to look into different styles of game. In <i>Pendragon</i>, you play a family dynasty in the days of Arthurian legend, which is a different way of looking at things and could prove interesting, particularly with the right group of people. I've seen people talk about <i>Burning Wheel</i> but haven't obtained a copy yet, but that might be another thing to look into some day. And I've also seen groups where the PCs have been created at the same time as members of a family, which I think could be an interesting way of creating a group with lots of connections for a campaign.</lj-cut>

Whew! I think I've touched on a lot here. Let me know if I missed anything, or if there's anything else you desperately want to see regarding my experiences with gaming.

"event","Dad gave me a ride to class yesterday, as he needed to be in that area for a while anyway, and on the way back he got a call.... from my cell phone! My little sis found it - somehow it had gotten under the dry sink, on the carpet so I couldn't hear it vibrate - and the dry sink is also nowhere near where I would expect to have lost it/have it fallen out of my pocket. My siblings have a theory that our greyhound, Lily, had something to do with it, and I'm inclined to agree. She does have a toy that buzzes, so maybe my phone just happened to ring as she was nearby and in a kind of playful mood, and she carried it out of the room, at which point it stopped buzzing and she got bored and dropped it. Of course, it could also have been the cats, trying to frame her - or I can at least see Annie swatting it the rest of the way under the dry sink while tussling with Chloe after Lily moved it most of the distance.

Anyway, I spent the rest of the day calling Lily a ""possible dirty rotten phone-stealing dog,"" and told her I was going to have to beat her for stealing the phone, which turned into me patting her head, scritching her ears, and splitting a piece of cheese between the two dogs before taking them for a romp in the back. So I'm a soft touch."

"event","My cell phone is currently AWOL. Hopefully I will get a new one soon, but Dad apparently lost the paperwork and has yet to print out another copy (it needs to be from his account or I'd print the stupid thing up), and though he'd been saving the old phones, he got mad that some of his stuff got moved around when my brothers cleaned the house, so when I asked him if he could hook one of the old ones up for me he got a bit snippy and told me he would but someone moved them on him. At the moment I'm borrowing Mom's phone, which doesn't have any of your guys' numbers on it (and I'm not going to post any of our numbers on a public entry), but which I can use to call Dad and/or home and/or Mom's work and/or AAA and/or 911 if I have anything crazy happen when I'm driving the car.

So anyway, if you try to call/message/whatever me and I don't get back to you, it's not that I'm purposefully snubbing anyone or anything, it's just that I don't have a phone. I'm wondering if I could get something really basic for cheap at a Verizon kiosk or something and set it up 'til Dad finally gets around to ordering the new cell phones.

I did send a text message from Mom's phone to mine, asking whomever found the phone to call one of three numbers I gave in the message, so maybe someone will find it, see the message, and call. Not that I think I would look at text messages on a phone I found, but I think when you open it it shows the message. And if I found a cell phone in a place where there wasn't an obvious place to turn it in, I'd try looking at the contacts and call ""Home"" or ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" or one of the speed dial numbers, I think.

Anyway, it's about bedtime, so enough with my newest saga."

"event","In the next installment of the saga of my car, we took the battery back where we bought it and got it tested. It came up as ""replace battery,"" so we got a new one for free because it was still under warranty (but the next one's gonna be pro-rated, apparently). Dad isn't sure he likes their machine because so far every battery he's had tested there has said ""Replace battery;"" my brother argued that there's a high probability that since you feel the need to get the battery tested it will need replacing. The young guy working there tried to tell Dad it was something wrong with the starter switch going too far, getting stuck, and drawing away the power from the car. Dad said that the power would have come back on differently if that had been the case. I asked if that had anything to do with my headlights flickering; he told me they shouldn't have been flickering at all because at that point the car was running and power was coming from the engine rather than the battery.

In short, my car's now sitting out there with a new battery and the spare tire on the wheel. 

In other news, although I was hoarding my ability points on My Heroes, I noticed that Paint Future has changed and no longer gives extra experience, so I used my points to buy ""Predict Course of Events,"" which does give the appropriate status change.

"event","So I'm driving back from college, go around onto the shoulder a bit to get around a car making a left turn - and BAM! - hit something that made my car jerk a bit. And then it was shaking a bit as I'm driving down the road, so I pull over onto the shoulder, which fortunately is wide enough, and check out the tire. I can see the air leaving; it looks like white mist. There's a big old hole right in the side of the tire. So I call Dad and ask him if he wants me to call AAA or if he wants to deal with it. ""Call AAA - no, wait..."" I can hear him asking my brother if he feels like giving changing my tire a try, then, ""Don't call them yet; we'll be there in a bit to try and help.""

As I'm waiting, a man parks at his house and then walks over to make sure I'm okay. He asks several times if I'm sure I've got help on the way, and I tell him I just talked to my dad on my cell phone and he and my brother are coming, and if I need AAA I've got that too. He looks at the tire and pronounces it dead - which Dad agreed with, and I kind of suspected, as there was a big old hole in it. It was a pretty new tire, too - not like the ones in the back which are going to need replacing soon. Now I might well need two new front tires, though the remaining tire might be new enough still that if we find an identical size and brand we can use that one instead. So we shall see - I still say I shouldn't be driving, because I've got the worst luck with cars (I'd say it was some kind of bad karma, but that sounds like an even worse pun).

So anyway, I've got a spare on and we'll see what happens with the new tire on Monday when places are open. Tomorrow we're going to get a new battery and see if that helps out with the electric things, though it hasn't done that to me since Will's house (and of course flickering headlights on the way home from Will's, but I got home safely and they didn't actually go off). 

In other news, when I finally made it home from campus Mom and sis were heading out to buy a copy of the Fiddler on the Roof DVD from Barnes and Noble, so I got to tag along with them, and picked up several cool things. Also got some books for writing from Michael's where we went after that."

Went out, brother was scraping off his car, so I took the time to note that there were a plethora of emergency vehicles down the road in the opposite direction than we would have to turn to get to class. My brother informs me, ""We're taking this super-slow,"" and I readily agree. We haven't gotten far on the road - not even to the next driveway - when a car in the oncoming lane driving slowly down the hill spins out and goes into the ditch, the passenger side hitting a tree. My brother pulls over and puts on the flashers, and we jog up and wave down the police car who's coming from the other accident. Driver's only got superficial wounds, from what it looks like, but her fourteen-year-old daughter had to be cut out of the car with the jaws of life and brought away in an ambulance. My brother told me, ""I'm not driving to class in this,"" and I was very quick to agree, so we called Dad to contact the professor and tell him to be careful driving home, called Mom to tell her to be careful driving home and pass along word to her employees, and when the emergency vehicles had cleared away we used the first driveway we came to in order to turn around, and drove home super slow. 

Is it any wonder driving frightens me? Particularly in weather like this?

On that note, I just wanted to say thanks again to Will and his dad for being ready to help me jump my oddly possessed car the other night (it hasn't been nice enough to get it a new battery yet, but that's the plan. It also has yet to do that to me again, but at this point I'm thinking it's only a matter of time, and am not driving too far in it even when the weather is nice enough for me to feel relatively comfortable driving). Dad says thanks also!

I'm going to stay here, nice and warm, and say a prayer that everyone gets to their destinations safely despite this nasty weather! And then play some Morrowind."

In other news, I was recently reading through an old notebook where I'd collected ideas for character quirks, and had a thought about a character concept - someone with natural spellcasting capabilities who happens to be terrified of magic, but occasionally in certain threatening situations their magic erupts to protect them. In D&D I think it would probably have to be a sorceror, and kind of difficult to pull off as a PC because of that limitation on the main powers of the character. I could see it working in a GURPS game, though - natural spellcasting as well as some level of magery, and the character can still have other strengths with other points, as well as getting some kind of credit for the phobia itself.

This is somewhat better than another idea that I or someone else had of playing a vampire who's afraid of the undead."

<a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</a> is a thing for somewhat crazy wannabe novelists, or people who just like writing a lot. The premise is to write a short novel (50,000 words) in a month. And basically go for word count over worrying about quality... it's very ""Yay, creativity!"" Some people go for more than 50,000, but I didn't make 50,000 last year and decided to stick with that as a goal.

So since for the first couple weeks of November I had nothing to do but comb through sites looking for potential jobs and occasional subbing, etc., I plowed through a lot of words. Which is good now because with the current temporary job I've got, I'm coming home with a lot of my abilities drained, and it also makes for a longer day, especially with reports I've got to write up. So I'm in the 44,000 range now, though, and there's a good chance I'll be able to make 50,000 even if I do just get in a bit a day and maybe more on most weekends when I don't have Praxis and concerts to attend and this and that."

However, because I feel like putting something happy in here - I've been working on NaNoWriMo (details available on request) and have almost met my goal, and exceeded the word count from last year.

And maybe post on the board, because, you know, that might be a good thing...) then perhaps I could make some prettyful maps for that.

"event","So, since Halloween was on a Wednesday night, and since Wednesday is a night when we usually go to church, I decided to go to Wednesday evening Eucharist - in costume! I'd bought a costume that was on sale, kind of a black robe/gown with silver stars and moons, and then I found a really sparkly purple cape to go with it.

So Wednesday;s not a huge service, and there were only myself, my mom, my brother who's at home, the priest, and two other women. One of the other women admired my cape, and confessed that she loves sparkly things. But wait - the best is yet to come.

Wednesdays, instead of having a sermon as we do on Sundays, we have a sort of informal group discussion of the readings during that time, and everyone can share the thoughts the day's readings have inspired in them. Well, our priest says that my costume had reminded her of a friend, who wasn't exactly Christian and was very aware of the Wiccan tradition but they were still good friends, and she was thinking of how the readings for All Saints Day really seemed to tie in with the Celtic belief in ""thin places."" So I like this priest now. I think she might just be my favorite priest. And I certainly want to keep her as long as we possibly can! This is why I love being an Episcopalian."

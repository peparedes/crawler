I just finished cleaning up my room. heh... it is still not clean though, there is always something else that needs to be done. I spent the night with meaghan last night, poor thing, I think she got food poisoning or something cuz she was throwing up all night. After I took a shower at her house me and laura went out to lunch... fun stuff.

I start my job saturday. I still have to go buy some scrubs from walmart or something. That is going to be a LONG day (7-4). Hopefully it will be fun.
Plenty of hot guys work there though, so I should be okay... just kidding (i think)."

I just spent the last hour cleaning up my room. It needed it pretty bad since we got rid of our cleaning lady (and because I am lazy).

Honor's day wasn't that bad, probably because it was my grade being announced this year. Of course it sucked because they didn't announce my scholorship... eh, nobody cares about me. :("

Adam's drum solo ROCKED! everybody loved it
Me and Laura had a lot of fun up there. Messed up a little, but no biggie. Got to practice before we do it again sunday though.
Meg and Jack were so cute when they did their duet, it was b-e-a-utiful...
Jacks monologue was so sad... i don't know what I am going to do without her next year.
KT's poetry was good mind you... but it still cracked me up, I love that girl 
Laura and Ash's video was great, especially our old JH pictures.
And finally Mae and Pat were just so talented they didn't even have to do anything other than sit there! 
And for the question of the day- Where was John Sherer? I am going to have to get on to him. His speech would've been good.

Hehe me jackie and mae cellophane wrapped Patrick's car. It was COMPLETELY covered. Jack and Magen wanted to get him back for something and I just wanted to get in on the action. It was great, eventually i'll post a picture of it.

Me and my mom have somehow managed fight ALL DAY LONG... even when Lindz got home, they fought too. I don't know what is wrong with her.

Well I have a busy day tomorrow. I am getting my hair cut at 10:00, then off to my second interview at caldwell mill animal clinic (i think i am going to get it!) then off to honors day. sigh... I hate busy days"

Saturday I woke up at 7:00 and went mountain bike riding. I did the entire trail which is 16 miles. I think it was one of the hardest things I had ever done, but I felt good afterwards. Later I went to Erin's house and we had a lot of fun... to sum it up, segway, vegetable rice, master and commander, mnm's, pillow fight... it was great fun. Sunday the youth choir was singing in the early service so I went early to listen to them. Then we went to a mexican restraunt after sunday school. Laura came over that afternoon to see what Greer's newly painted room looked like. Then I helped her study for her chemistry exam. After that we had a lot of fun eating the different flavors of jellybeans, haha... we even turned it into a game... we are such dorks. 

Way back in January I submitted an essay for a scholarship called ""Juniors what's your story."" They posted the winners on the internet today and I was really hoping I would get it but I didn't... I was really disappointed cuz it was 9 $25,000 scholarships per state. o well
I had a dentist appointment today... I have to go back cuz they are going to redo 2 fillings and add another one...ouch.

"event","So a lot has happened the past week.

Friday I went right after school to get my hair done cuz I had prom that night. That was the first time I have ever actually liked my hair after I got it done. Then I went and picked up Adam's boutineer. After that I went to Meaghan's house cuz we were all going to meet there and get ready. So I got ready with Meaghan and Magen until everybody arrived. Some of Meg's older sisters friends came to the house to. So all in all, there were about 10 girls there, plus their dates, plus their mothers, it was pretty crowded. So when we finished taking the usual pictures, we set out to Kobe's. We had reservations for 7:00 but when we got there at 6:30, they seated us right away. Well... a lot of people were at that same restraunt that night. Amy's surpise bday party was there, so I got to see all of them which was awesome. Also Carlyn's pathetic ex-boyfriend was there too. After we finished eating we went to the dance which was at the Harbert Center in downtown birmingham. We were one of the first to get there which was kind of pathetic, but at least we didn't have to wait to get out pictures taken. So we danced for about 3 hours straight... it was awesome. After the dance we went back to Meaghan's house and watched a movie. The guys left at about 2:30ish and we went straight to sleep. 

The next morning we woke up and Meaghan fixed up breakfast. We couldn't think of anything to do to pass the time, so we just all came over to my house and watched Gothika, which was a lot of fun. Then we left straight from my house to go meet some other people at Richard's bbq, but it was a disappointment because the train was not running that day sigh... Then we all piled up in a few cars and drove over to Vestavia to see the play, ""Anything Goes."" Jackie did awesome and it was one of the best plays I have ever seen, with plenty of crossdressers and gay people in it...haha. ahem, anyways, I saw a lot of people there, including Kevin and Alex. So after that I went back to Laura's house and we fell asleep to the movie High Crimes.

Sunday I went to church and we had a great lesson on the Second Coming in sunday school. I didn't feel like going home after church so me and Laura went and got Wendy's and then went to her house to finish watching School of Rock. I went home after that and pretty much just watched TV. My parents came home from the beach that night and Lindsey came home from visiting Grant at Vanderbuilt. 

Monday I stayed home from school cuz I felt like I was going to throw up the whole day. I still felt that way the next day but went to school anyways cuz I didn't want my makeup work to get to be too much. We didn't have school today cuz our superintendent's son died. So Carlyn, Amy, Grey, and I all went to Vestavia to eat lunch with them. We had to tell them we were from the Bwood student stampede thought, otherwise they wouldn't let us in. Well... Im going to leave for church in a little while. Carlyn, Amy, Morgan, Warren, and I'm not sure who else are going to the Puddle of Mud concert tonight. They asked me if I wanted to go, but since I only know like 2 of their songs I decided to go to church instead. 
 
Well... I hope that brings everybody up to date, cuz my hands are tired."

"event","Well... I've been overcome by some very strange feeling and I actually wanted to write in my journal! strange huh?

I turned in my english critical paper this morning, and I hope that it was the last paper I will have to write this year (fingers crossed). We had this boring fine arts assembly this morning... I hate sports recognitions! blah... but I think that was the last one. So only one month left of school... it seems to be slowly winding down. 

I have the Spain Park prom this friday... I'm really stressed out cuz I have to make time for a hair and makeup appointment after school and get back to Meaghan's house by 5:45. But regardless, I can't wait till Friday comes! It should be a lot more fun than the B'wood dances because then I can actually booty dance (or whatever I want to do). Nope, you can't do that at our dances because all the teachers basically make a circle around you and watch you dance. Plus, Meaghan is going to be there and dance with me! We are either going to Kobe's or Stix... not sure, but either one is bound to be a disaster because all the people I know who make reservations there don't get seated for a while. But maybe this time it will be different. We are having the after-dance party at Meaghan's house. Laura will come over later and spend the night with me, Meaghan, and Magen. I CAN'T WAIT!

My dad bought four new movies Sunday and I have suceeded in watching all of them. I watched Gothika, Something's Gotta Give, Cheaper by the Dozen, and Beyond Borders. And yet I still crave more movies, guess I am just a movie freak. WOW... did anybody watch One Tree Hill tonight? That was some drama..."

I don't think so). So I was sort of in a bad mood Saturday or maybe I was just tired cuz I went mountain bike riding and rode 11 miles. I practically slept the rest of the day. During cheerleading practice we looked through a magazine a different uniform styles, cuz this year is the year we can order new ones. I can't wait to see what we get. After practice I went to Erin's house to watch the edited version of out English project. I have to say she did a great job (although she put a little too many embarrassing thing about me in there). If your in my English class you'll get to see it!"

I know I am gonna get sick of it cuz we have it monday through thursday until the end of the year, and we only got 2 weeks off (plus spring break). Speaking of... for spring break I went to Atlanta with some of my friends, Auburn to watch lindz dance at the greek sing event, and the New Orleans with my youth group.

Anyways... I finally bought HALO today! After school I went to best buy and bought it with the gift card that Pat gave me for my birthday. So I was playing it all afternoon. It was kind of scary when I played in the story mode, with aliens jumping out from everywhere and the vibrating controls at just the right moment (I dropped it twice it startled me so bad... lol). I like playing it better the way we do at Adam's house, against other players.

"event","Wow! I haven't updated in a week! I have been so busy.

Cheerleading tryouts were this week. I didn't get home before 8:30 every night this week (except wed). After cheer clinic I went to the house of this JV girl and helped her with her cheerleading. And before cheer clinic I helped this girl who was trying out with me. So right now I am sick of cheerleading. Tryouts were last night before I got to church. It was nerveracking. For those of you who have no clue, the girl trying out has to show ""spirit"" while she runs out in front of the judges and do the cheers and jumps in front of everybody alone. Its pretty scary. One of the girls pulled her calf muscle really bad. But... in case you didn't hear... I MADE IT! YAY! So i was very happy.

After tryouts I went straight to the church to help set for our garage sale/ pancake breakfast. After working for a while (which i didn't do) we all took the charter bus (haha) to Chili's for a late dinner. It was a lot of fun... I hit Ryans drink while he drinking it on purpose, but a little to hard, and it went all over him. So then he was like ""ur gonna pay"" and poured it all over me. lol, i deserved it. THEN, meaghan was like, omg, Nathan Lisenbee is working here! So i leaned back in my chair to look for him, and fell backwards. lol, but it wasn't too bad cuz i caught myself, (but not the chair). After that we went back to the church and got on our pajamas, watched tv, and then went to bed. Me and meaghan text messaged people till 1:30, lol. I woke up early that morning and took a shower, ate pancakes, and when the garage sale opened i started working. I was just walking around not knowing what I was doing. Then Magen told me that drew said Laura's car got broken into. So me and Meaghan ran into the parking lot to make sure that she was ok, but she had already left to go to her uncle's funeral. So Meaghan and I made sure that our cars were ok. And sure enough, mine was broken into also. I was so upset. blah... they stole my stereo, every single cd I had in there (about 30), my ddr beat pad that meaghan gave me for my birthday  so we could play doubles, stole my entire ashtray which i kept money in, all my cheerleading candy that i had gotten, the candy and the balloon that meaghan had given me for my birthday also, and they broke into my glovebox in between the two front seats (so not it doesn't lock anymore cuz they destroyed it). Now I have to drive my car in silence cuz my stereos gone. *sigh* so I am really depressed. But I was also lucky, cuz my northface jacket was sitting in plain sight in my passenger seat and they didn't steal it. THats why we think that it was some kids. Still... From Laura's car they stole some of her cd's (cuz her actual cd player is in her trunk), ripped out her ashtray too but at least left in her car, two of her jackets, and some blankets. Just totally random stuff. No one else's car was broken into, but laura forgot to lock her car, and they broke in thru my windows, it just sucks. I feel really bad cuz meaghan just got me those presents and then they stole them. 

After we finished with the garage sale (which was really boring) I went to Dawson to play at my basketball game, but Trinity beat us. Now I at home and about to go take a shower to get ready for the Spring Fling dance tonight. I hope that I have fun!"

That wouldn't be that bad except the truck had extremely uncomfortable foldout backseats and I was in the back. We spent the night at her Laura's grandmother's house. The next morning we drove an hour or so to her grandfather's farm. We hung out for about 2 hours there and drove the fourwheeler and ate lunch. The we drove another hour to her granfather's house. There we had to pick up the tanning bed and put it in the truck. It must have weighed like 300 pounds. Laura, her mom, and I were trying to lift it into the truck and we could not lift the stupid thing. We had to put it on a rolling thing and roll it to the truck and then slide the bed on a board up to the truck. But it took about an hour to do that. I can barely lift my hands to type. They hurt so bad. I also hit my foot on the trailer hitch... that hurt even worse, Im gonna have a huge bruise. Then we drove to trussville where the lady who wanted it lives. Then we had to put it in her basement. But it was a little easier cuz her husband helped us. But all in all it was a fun day. So now I am back home, although no one's here right now. So I feel like I haven't seen my family in a week. I don't know how I am gonna survive college cuz I get so homesick. That is why I wanna go somewhere around here. Well I've got some things to do before I go to bed. Tomorrow I have cheerleading clinic (throught the rest of the week). *sigh*"

But then again, I love hanging out with everyone else to... anyways...</P>
<P>&nbsp;School was okay... It went by really fast so I was happy. We did&nbsp;a really dumb lab in chemistry, where we dropped a pencil on a target 100 X's, to demonstrate the electron cloud orbital. We got our test back and I had made a 97%! So I was&nbsp;very happy.&nbsp;whatever. I made a 100 on my Power and Glory quiz in English. Fell asleep in History....zzzz... We had missionaries in Latin. They were from Indonesia. The ENTIRE period they talked about the language and how it relates to all the other languages. They barely said one word about missions and what they did. But regardless, it was really interesting. Made a 76 on my Bible test. Wasn't too happy about that. But at least I didn't make in the 40's like some people did. </P>
<P>It seems like I am fighting with my mom all the time... we can't agree on anything. She almost wouldn't let me go to Adam's cuz she was going to make me babysit Greer, and if you don't know Greer is in the 6th grade. I started staying home by myself in 5th grade. But my mom was like ""she's afraid of the dark so you need to stay here."" I was like, ""she needs to get over it."" *sigh* But she eventually let me go and Greer stayed home by herself. I guess I can understand why she would be afraid though. We live out in the woods and sometimes coyotes howl or our house starts to ""groan"" cuz we have water pipes which run through our walls. lol... it can be pretty freaky sometimes. But still....</P>

Kinda worried about myself because I promised two other Junior high girls that I would help them with their cheerleading during tryout week... So I hope I will have some time to work on my own skills. *sigh* I like helping others but I am worried that I am going to get stressed out. Cheer tryout week is always the most awful week of the year. I don't know why everybody has to make so much of a big deal about it, they don't with basketball or tennis or anything else, just cheerleading. :-( So if I am really mean to you or something, just ignore me, or better yet slap me or something. lol (not really)
 
I can't wait till this weekend cuz I am going with Laura to Atlanta. We are going to her grandfather's farm and we are going to bring back a tanning bed that they have! I thought that I was going to get a billion free minutes, but I found out that they are going to sell it. lol... Ill just have to make sure I get some minutes in before the dance next week.

After most everybody had left, Meaghan, Laura, and I watched 28 days later... hehe they liked it and we ended up staying up to watch it until 2:00.

We got up at 6:45 this morning to get to church on time... Laura, Meaghan, and I all had to take showers so it took a while. At the church work day we painted, organized, windexed, just about anything you could imagine. I had to clean out a distgusting gunky sink, but at least it was sparkling by the time I got through with it. When we were going out for lunch, Meaghan and I rode with one of our friends, and when she was backing out, she backed up into this steel thingy that the construction workers had out. It dented her car pretty badly. But she handled it pretty well and didn't get too upset.

I kinda wish that it wasn't on a holiday cuz then I could relax and get away from cheerleading and all that other stressful stuff. O well.

I am just like ""leave me alone... i will do it when I get to it ok?!""  hehe.. it kinda annoys me, especially since some of those people who say that to me do nothing after school and I never get home till like 6:30 a lot of nights. 

My dad and I broke my printer... when I had printed something, the font came out really weird. So he tried to take the printer apart but accidently broke something in the process... so now I have no printer!... It is really annoying cuz I had something I wanted to print and when I turned to printer on, it practically went ballistic! lol.. well not exactly. I g2g go play DDR.

P.S.- This journal is dedicated to Brandon. A whole journal with NO smilies! Just for you Brandon."

Speaking of the dance... I have absolutely no idea who I should ask to the dance... I don't know whether I should ask someone from school or from church... ugh, I hate the stress of dances. Whoever came up with them was an idiot. It would be so much easier if I had a boyfriend so I would automatically be going with someone... but i don't. hmmm... I am just depressing myself.

We started to watch 28 days later.... but Carlyn thought it was so gross that she started crying!   lol... so I took that out and we started watching G.I.

"event","Today was a pretty uninteresting day for me. Although I was in a good mood, have yall ever had one of those moments where you want to get up and give someone a hug or do something really nice for someone? Well... that is how I felt. I'm here by myself right now, unless you count my crazy cleaning lady. I am in my room hiding from her right now... lol. And my room is sparkling clean... which is always a good feeling. I have to be back at the school at 5:30 tonight to cheer at the girl's and guy's basketball game. But it won't be too bad because it is as home. I feel like doing something right now... like going to the bean hole or something... I'm sure that Carlyn's is there right now. Erin talked like she might come to my game tonight... hopefully she does. What I really want is for my mom to come... she has only been to 2 of my games! tsk tsk. uh oh... my cleaning lady is calling me... hmmm.... i think I'll go hide in my closet."

"event","I just finished writing a poem for English class and I was surprised at how fast I was able to get it done... I'm pretty satisfied with it and only have two more lines to go. At the moment I am incredibly sick of cheerleading because I have worn my uniform to school more than I have worn normal clothes. Its ironic because last year I would have killed to have been able to wear it this many times. Goes to show that I'm never happy with what I have. I feel a little more refreshed today because we didn't have practice, so that was good.I also went to wednesday night. It was good because Brandon spoke about how we need to love others. There can be a lot of separation in our youth group sometimes when we don't even realize it. It made me think though... I am going to try harder to go up and talk to visitors from now on. I know that if I was one of them, I would really appreciate someone doing that for me. I'm kinda frustrated with my computer right now because I can't get it to do any cool things with the journal... oh well i'll just have to ask carlyn how she did hers."

"event","one day a panda walks into a chines bar, and says "" Gimme some Bambo!""
so you know, the waiter, not wanting to be mauled by a panda BEAR goes and gets Mr. Panda-Poo some bamboo.
the panda eats it, pulls out a semi-automatic, and shoots the waiter dead!!!! (which is pretty cool, because pandas don't have thumbs, so he's pretty cool!)
anyways, the next day, the panda comes back, and does the same thing.
this becomes a trend, and each day, Mr. Panda-Poo comes in, and eats bambo, shoots the waiter and leaves.
can't you see the headlines now? ""multipul time murdering panda still at large""? i can.
anyways, so about a week into this horrible killing spree, the mangager of the chines place comes and has a little talk with the panda. why it took him this long i don't know, i guess he was worried for his own safety. well so he guy asks Mr. panda-Poo why he's killing all his waiters, and the panda says ""Look me up in the dictionary""
so, you know, they guy does, and it says ""panda-<i>N</i>, eats bambo, shoots, and leaves""

"event","if you think girls are the only fickle sex, your wrong. boys are just as bad if not worse. and it sucks. alot. we should send all boys to boot camp where they can learn not to mess with girl's emotions. everyone with me? alright, so monday morning we charge the highschool and send all the boys away! good, now we got that settled.

<i>Te regalo una rosa
Le encontre en el camino
No se si esta vestido
O tiene un solo vestido.
<br>
Si la riega el verano se embriaga de
Olvidos
Si alguna vez fue amada
O tiene amor escondido.
<br>
ay amor, eres la rosa que me da calor
Eres el sueno de mi solidad,
Un letargo de azul, un eclipse de mar
Ay amor, yo so satelite y tu eres mi sol
Un universo de agua mineral, un espacio de 
Luz
Que solo llenas tu, ay amor...
<br>
Te regalo mis manos
Mis parpados caidos
El beso mas profundo
El que se ahora en un gemido
Te regalo un otono
Un dia entre abril y junio
Un rayo de ilusiones
un corazon al desundo.</i>

"event","WEll, now let me see, Im gonna talk to you about the romans.
I<i> know</i>  you all are very familar with them, but I don't care. 

I think that the romans were crazy. Think about this:
the diameter of the Saturn5 rocket, you know the one that took us to the moon, was directly related the the diameter of two roman horse's asses, because the roman's built their roads  wide enough to hold a chariot , and the chariot size was dictated but the two horse ass diamter. Well when railroads were first build they made them uniform, and set the to the size of the old roman roads. (they were easy to build over) So the size of our railroads were the same as the europian ones,(like i said uniform) and the Saturn5 had to be transported by rail from the various manufactuers to the lanch pad. Therefor the Romans are crazy because they effected the size fo the rocket going to the moon more that 1000 years after they were <i>no more.</i>"

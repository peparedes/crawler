"event","Okay, last thursday was suppose to be some kind of reunion for me and my high school best friends...It was nice talking and things of that such. But we didn't really talk much about things really affecting our lives. Gosh we are very impersonal. We talked about relationships and how other peoples lives have changed and all that great gossipy mess. We said we would meet again this Friday but no one has made the plans or anything like that which is kind of sucky... It's hard sometime to get back close with people you haven't seen in a while and I must say that it's all of our faults. And I defiantly blame myself because I didn't stay in touch like I did. I kind of dropped them because my life was here and theirs was there and then I started having different interest and it just went all down hill from there. I haven't been a great high school friend....

I wonder what things will be like during the reunion...Will we care to even go????"

"event","I wrote this a couple of days ago and just now thought about it....


(Sunday)....Tonight I gradually think of work. As I look for a messenger bag on ebay after being outbidded by someone 1 minute before closing(the bastard)...I'm tired of these E-Bay pirates who steal others bidded treasures in the very blink of an eye of the last minute of the bidding time. Like get off of it. I'm not really to bummed because I realized like 14 minutes till bid being over that it was corduroy who freaking buys a corduroy messenger that's black...I'm not that type of vintage...

Just a fashion whore for anything vintage.

Off of the whole ebay drama and back to my dead end no paying job that is making me get a 2nd job...Well, wait it's my freaking credit card debt and this car payment making me get another job. I'm placing blame on the wrong thing. It's all my fault. Unfortunantely, I will have to juggle this two job thing and school for a while until I get enough money saved. That is so going to be a pain in the ass. I hope my classes are kind of simple or something. No complex shit for me.

Well, off I go to finish the kitchen..

My random oblivion thoughts."

"event","I thought I was the lucky one to escape the grasp of the pesky cheap people of Atlanta; however I was wrong...Dead wrong....I have been sent to purgatory without me even knowing or remembering that was the destination. How the hell do I get myself into these disastrous predicaments????

The only good I can actually say that I will get out of this is that I will receive more money and more money is great especially for me right now... BUt I do know that this will be hell on Earth people will be ripping people apart trying to get to their tickets..... I hope I escape without any battle wounds...I can just see the glare in the eyes of all of the people who ordered tickets waiting and wanting their tickets for this performance that is absolutely FREE and over fucking booked.....

....this will be continued about my trip to Hades......."

"event","\b{When did boy/girl friendships stop being platonic and more benefits motivated?}

That's the question that crept in my head this morning after my headache subsided. That reminds me, I need not to drink as much next time when I go out. I always thought that we as human beings could co-exist in this world having friendships with the opposite sex. Maybe some can but obviously the boys I meet are just retarded. They don't understand when I say friendship I really mean friends. It does not mean friends with benefits. Men think totally different from women. They seem to have this motive lurking behind every time your around them. Friendship has turned into this concoction where people are seeking something from you in return to being your friend or to benefit by being around you in some sort of fashion.

Has society become parasites????????"

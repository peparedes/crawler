"event","RIP Michael Jackson. I grew up with you, and know that my children will also grow up with your music.

I started to watch mtv who was playing all of his videos, and i found myself singing along to all of the songs. Then &quot;Scream&quot; came on and i rocked out in my livingroom. My poor neighbors. I was so looking forward to hoping to get his concert in London on tv bc we all needed a dose of what the &quot;real&quot; MJ was. he was not well in these past years.... i will only remember the amazing, iconic things about him.

"event","I am part of an organisation called NOAH (national Organization of albinism and hypo pigmintation). I am on a web board that people with albinism or parents of children with it or people just wanting know more about it, call talk. There are a few catigories like any web board, and i sift through all of them often. 

I've always been willing to answer questions and ensure parents that their kid is going to be just fine. They just need to treat them normally. Many of their children have better eye sight than me (I've concluded I'm one of the poorest sighted people on this board) and I have gottan a lot fine in life.

What bother me is that someone will ask a question. Like, someone my age. Like, a woman posted a few days ago about how she has been trying to get a teaching job for years and feel discriminated against bc of her looks and eye sight. A parent replied saying at the NOAH yearly confereence they met two teacher with albinism and they will be fine. And that their kid is 2 months old with albinism and is fine.

How the HELL is that sopposed to help them!

I posted something the other day about my troubles with soldering. I asked if anyone had any expierience with it. I am ahving a hard time desolding things, and i don't know if it's bc i just stink at it or bc of my vision. I said that i have tried magnifying glasses but it doesn't help.

A mom with a 3 year old wrote back saying at the conference she met someone who uses magnifying glasses. And i could try that.

hence, did you just read what i wrote?

Many times parents write about fears they have for their children. Like, social fears. They realize that their kids can't see faces. I then try, and like the two other people with albinism who talk to them, tell them about how people with low vision need to adapt. And tell them how their child will too.

But the parents don't listen. It's like they want to freak out more to each other than talk to the pople WITH the condition.

When I was younger NOAH was formed when I was 2. I've grown up with this organisation. It was always gears towards people living with the condition and educating parents about it. These days it is only about kids that are 6 and younger. They have bowl-a-thons bc...the heads of NOAH i guess think that's all kids with albinism can do? What about the older generations? What about the people that are in high school and starting life in a new city and having to deal with it? They have forgottan about the PEOPLE WITH albinism and are just alking to parents. 

My whole life my main goal has to become a mativational speaker. I want to talk about my condition and educate people about it. i want others to know that's ""it's ok"" that I have really bad eyes, because I have found ways around it. i want the parents to LISTEN to the stories of people that have grown up with albinism and are leading amazing lives.

NOAH is looking people new people to be on the Board of Directors. You need to be nominated or can nominate yourself to be on it. the application is due August 1. I have to meet two Saturday's out of the year, one in fall, one in spring. I'm unhappy with what is happening to NOAH. I want to begin living my dream. 

Do you think i should apply for it?"

He doesn't even have his license! He tried to visit Britney Spears when she was in the hospital, and make a show of it. GO AWAY. Girl needs REAL help, not your bs. This episode is about couples and guys who won't commit and he's yelling, like literally yelling, at the woman. He's saying horrible things like ""What is your problem? WHy would he marry you? You'rs going to be an awful wife"" Wow, thank you Mr. Therapist, that was exactly what I needed, you to tell at me and say awful thigns about me. Yeah, that is going to help me grow as a person. Does he think that the things he says may effect the people more and thus make their situation worse? There is a reason they are that way, let down to the bottem of it, don't just ASUME.
Dr. Phil is one of therapists that make people scared to go see a REAL one. He's one of those people that if someone goes to him with BIG problems, they would walk away saying ""my therapist scrwed me up more, and i refuse to ever go to one gain""
Good Job Dr. Phil. Why to screw it up for everyone.

But during the day when teens are awake they show programs like Tila Tequila where pl are jumping in pools on pudding, and taking baths in champaine and stuff...and show spring break madness,
But the documenteries about having safe sex and pl with HIV and ""wear a condom!"" shows ...are on at 4AM.

"event","I found this on the NOAH websit. National Organization of Albinism and Hypopigmintation.... is this....true?!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The link takes you to the web site for Opthonix and I-Zon lenses.  At present they are the only lens firm to offer individually tailored distorting lenses that can cancel the distortion in an albino eye caused by an imperfect shape.

 A few other firms have played with the idea of distorting glasses lenses or contact lenses - but they have yet to come to market with such products.

How do they work ?

Imagine looking at yourself in the back of a shiny soup spoon.  Your face appears OK except for a bigger nose than you would have expected.

Now look at yourself in the back of a shiny table (desert) spoon.  This time your face is distorted - one side of your face might appear to be bigger or wider than the other side.  

The albino eye is a bit like a table spoon rather then the ""pigmento"" equivalent of a soup spoon.  Because of the imperfect shape of the albino eyeball the left hand side part of the cornea might have a different focussing characteristic to the right hand side of the cornea.  This is termed differential astigmatism.

Because the left and right hand sides of the cornea have different shapes then a regular optometry lens cannot correct the refractive error.  The eye Doc's trial lens might fix the left hand side but does nothing much for the right hand side. Guess what - every trial lens does not improve eyesight.

What is needed is a correcting lens that treats the left and right hand side parts of the cornea in different ways.  

In order to determine the exact correction the eye Doc must use an instrument called an Aberrometer.   This draws a contour map of the shape of the eye.  In a regular pigmento eye the contour lines will be approx circular (soup spoon shape) but an albino eye will have contour lines with more of a table spoon shape.

 In the I-Zon system the contour map is transferred from the aberrometer to a lens cutting machine.  The resultant glasses lens is designed to cancel the distortion  in the albino cornea.  

 How well does it work in practice ?

 Dr Brian Chou who has a practice in San Diego (see his response to my earlier article in the Autumn edition of Noah News)  reports that about 60 percent of pigmentos notice an advantage in using the Opthonix lense compared to regular lenses. (personal communication)

My own experience of albino eyes is more positive.  I checked about 10 eyes at the recent HPS conference with a distorting lens. 8 out of 10 HPS delegates noticed a significant increase in their vision.  One young man in his early 20's reported an improvement that allowed him to see the registration plate of a car parked outside the hotel whereas with his regular glasses he could only just make out the shape of the car.  I was lucky to get my lens back !!

 
If you visit the Opthonix web site you will be able to find out which US and international eye Docs have the necessary equipment.  At present the lenses are only available in a restruicted range of refractive values  - but there is a work-around that should minimise this difficulty. 

 As you might have guessed - I am particularly interested in this distorting lens technique. Ideally I would like to see it applied to soft contact lenses that could also include an opaque black coating that would fix photophobia.  The main issue is one of volume - lens manufacturers are unlikely to make such products for a few thousand albino eyes - they would prefer to service a market of millions.

 There will be more details of this technique in the downloadabel version of my presentation at the HPS conference.   Please email me for a copy at

The man's vision was corrected to 20/200 with the lens it was 20/70. I""M corrected to 20/200.... I... I need to do more research. I... I htink I may start a bake sale to afford these contact lenses if it's true....

Now, we all know that I suck at modern lol can't get the damn ballet out of me, but I've been working really hard in this class. I use it as a release from all the stresses in my life. He does pilaties, yoga, some ballet warmup stuff, combinations across the floor and stuff, and it's just wonderful!

There are about 8-10 of us in the class and he really didn't say much to me today. I was kinda forced to go into the front row and be in the first group for combos (which if you haven't taken a dance class with me, I don't do) and i nailed everything! At the end of class today my teacher came up to me and told me that i did an amazing job today and really nailed my combinations and looked beautiful. WOW! I was so happy! I mean, modern, me?

In a third case, WHY GREASE! I mean it was on Bway a few years ago and SUCKED ASS. They had ever star in it from Rosie Odonald to Domonique Daws to Xena Warrior Princess chick. I mean EEEEEEWWWWWWWWW! And so now they are putting these people in? Maybe if they had chosen a different musical that is acutally GOOD or an up and coming one, but GREASE! How stero-typical can we get? 

In the forth sense, it is getting someone out there with this hidden talent and throwing them on Bway. BUT then there are the poor starving actors out there who are AMAZING but can't get a gig and now these kids who are going to be throwing drama around and being all reality TV like are taking the big paying job.

So as a theatre person I feel really torn about this idea and so far...I don't like it. and I'm looking at it the Bway has jsut lowered their standards.

"event","yeah that title sounds like an oximoron i know, but it does. You see, since late September, early October, I have had horrible insomnia. I sleep when my body makes me pass out. Normally the lights are on, and it's usually right after work til about 10PM i sleep. Then I'm up all night. I do crawl into bed, but then my mind starts thinking when i lie there and there is no wauto sleep.

Today I was going through the same steps and I gave up on that whole sleep thing around 5am. I went to youtube.com , my new favorite place because i can watch old episodes of shows I miss, and I searched My So Called Life.

I came across the episode that I never saw the end of that I have always ALWAYS wanted to knwo the end of. It's the one when Ricky runs away from home and is living in the warehouse. It's the Christmas episode, and for years, over a decade now, i have wondered WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED! idk why but i mean it was my favorite show ever, and i just wanted to knwo what happened! TOnight I got to find out.

It ends with an angel. There is a homelss girl that Angela finds who says that she has been watching over Ricky and making sure he's ok. It turns out that she is an angel watching over him. It was one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in TV. The mom is looking for Angela who runs away and comes across the homeless girl. She stops and asks what happened to her and she says that she had a fight with her mom. Then Angela's mom realizes that she is a ghost and just goes ""...hoe did you die?"" It was beautiful. Simply beautiful. 

I don't know why, but i jsut feel this sense of comfort from it. I haven't been to church in a really long time, but I pray every night. I always say a prayer right as a lie down to try and sleep, when the lights are off and I'm in my PJs in my big bed that was so comfortable two months ago when things were just amazing in my life, and I pray. ANd i don't know why, maybe lack of sleep, but just watching that episode it was jsut...the perfect timing for it. It  didn't load earlier and now it did. 

I know it sounds strange and all, but it just made me feel that everything is going to be ok. There are angels out there, i have always belived in that, but something about the power of seeing this tonight just made things ok for me.

And now, after all these years!!!, I know what actually happened!!!! I feel a sense of closure with My So Called Life! hahha THANK YOU YOUTUBE PERSON!!!

I GOT THE JOB AT TRINITY!!!!! I can't believe it! I got another board programmin gjob in Phenoix and it was going to be really cool, but I wanted Trinity so much more. They gave me til Monday to decide, so I called Trinity asking them if they had made a decision yet and to let me know yes or no by Monday. So Monday rolls around and I'm in the Electrics shop waiting on my ME (as always) and my phone rings. It's Trinity and they OFFER ME THE JOB! 
soooooooooo
IN mid-September I will be moving to Providence, RI. I will be working the the Trinity Reperatory Theatre as the light board programmer nad operator for the show sin their downstairs theatre. I will be learing the OBsession 600 and O2, two boards I have been wanting to learn all freaking year! (a reason why I wanted back to NYSF). I will have a salary + time and a half after 42 hours (nice pay checks on tech weeks!) and FULL BENEFITS!!!! and get this guys did I mention STAFF!!!!!!!!!!! NO MORE INTERNSHIPS!!!!!

so yeah I declined the job in Pheonix.

This means I will be close to ALL MY FRIENDS, back on the EAST COAST, and get this....SEASONS!!!!!! I'm so excited!

Thank you God, thank you so much. thank you....

Mike left otday, I'm sad and hurt and angry and i'm going to miss him all at once. What a flood of emotions....and a waste of a summer romance... I want more than he can give me. The next one who comes laong is going to have to be so attentive to me bc...idk...men hurt me...

Had the worst changeover of hte summer this weekend. THeprocess was so yucky bc we have a new staff guy and an old staff person from beofer my supervisors is the lD a show we're putting up. So it was Z telling us how they used to do it, both MEs and the new guy Jake all working differently and colliding heads and us crew going ""wtf are we doing?!"" It was messy, but Joel came back bc Night Music is his show and man I missed that kid so much! Without Steve the ALD there I was never more relaxed on headset than i was this week. 

man itjust hit me how exhausted I am,...

WHEEEEEEEEEEE I GOT THE JOB I WANTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!

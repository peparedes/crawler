I mean you read other people's journals and it't like "" wow, thank you so much for sharing your entire life story with me... "" And then there's the case of the people that read this. I mean I look as who has read it and it's a little wierd to see some people that never talk to me have looked at this thing more times than my closest friends have. I mean if you wanna know, ask...and if you don't know me, why the hell do you care?! So yeah. I'm done with all this silly online journal stuff...and if you ever really care about whats going on with my life...you know where I am.

"event","So yesterday was Christmas and it was absolutely wonderful. :-D The night before, as soon as i got off work at 10( yes, between express and outback i worked 12 hours on christmas eve), i went out to adam's and gave him part of his present and gave his parents theirs. i got the season one dvd set of the OC from him and this book i wanted and an auburn t-shirt from his parents. sweet. sow e said hey to a few of his friends and then i headed home. i had planned on sleeping on on christmas day since i have been woking everyday of the break but no such luck. i'm too much of a little kid at christmas and woke up at 8am. oh well. haha. and i must say, santa did a damn good job this year- i got everything i wanted-- ralph lauren style perfume, benefit makeup, an mp3 player, a pink lacoste shirt ( way to go b-friend! hehe), a cool coffee maker (SWEET!), a kick ass purse that ellie made, some books i wanted, jewelry and alot of other things i can't remember off the top of my head. so between the celebration at our house and the one at the dawsons, it really was a wonderful christmas. i love my crazy family & i love christmas! :-D
but unfotunately, today i started back at work. i really am going to kill myslef between all these jobs. i keep saying never again, but in order to afford my shopping habits, i'll have to do it again over summer. haha. oh well. tomorrow i get the night off so i get to go out with the family and i get new years eve night off so i get to go out with the bff. score! but i do wish i had more time to spend with all of them...and adam. i never get to see any of them it seems. i mean adam and i go to the same school and especially towards the end of the year, i felt like i never saw him at all. and it sucks because he always makes me so happy and we have so much fun together ( i love you bf! lol ) and same with anna-kate...who goes to school all the way in damn florida. and with the family...well i just never have time to come home anymore during the school year between the sorority, the interior design major, and the job. oh blah. so i think i'll take off from all the jobs a few days before i go back to school so i can hang out with everyone. :-)
well it's bedtime because i've got to be up to work at 9 tomorrow morning. hope everyone had a WONDERFUL christmas!! :-D

"event","* 8 days until Christmas! Oh, I'm SOO excited! So far, everything here has been great, so I really think it's gonna be a kick ass Christmas this year. Oh I can't wait to see what Santa brings me! haha.
* So far, being home is wonderful. My mom and I went out and went shopping and hung out one day and that was so much fun. And I got new danskos haha. It really is amazing how much she and I connect now that I'm away most of the time. I mean the night I came home, she and I sat down and talked for hours. And my dad is the same way. He and I were decorating the tree a few nights ago and he actually put all joking aside and a serious conversation with me...that didn't involve school.
Adam, being the wonderful boyfriend that he is, took me out the day after I got home and replaced all the sweaters that I left at school and then took me to my favorite resturaunt. :-D It was fun times, like usual but it's gonna be hectic trying to see him over the break because I have three jobs and he has two. Oh yay.
Last night, Anna-Kate and went shopping for a while ( because we're wonderful at doing that ) and then went to Outback for dinner ( yay 50% discount) and met all the people I'm going to be working with over Christmas---they were all a little over-excited to see me which freaked me out a little...but if they love me that much, maybe it wont be that hard to get out of a new year's eve shift haha. After that we went and saw Closer. Jude Law, I want to have your children. haha. Besides him the movie was good too, very interesting and not exactly your typical love story. But it would have been better if Anna-Kate didn't feel the need to repeat everything 5 minutes after they happened just in case I wasn't paying attention. haha. 
Today, Ellie will finally be done with school so now she and I can hang out with her. Yay for the little sister!
But unfortunately, now my work schedule starts kicking in. I baby sat yesterday, I've got only one day off at Outback in the next week and I double up with Express and Outback tomorrow for the first time. Hectic, yes. Fun, sometimes. Money, lots. I'm only doing it for the money--because I insist on buying my friends awesome Chirstmas presents and I want to have more money when I go back up to school.
So yeah, it's time to get ready for the day!

"event","So I'm finally home in wonderful Charleston and i am so happy! i'm sad that i won't be with all my friend from up school but i need this break after all those insane exams.
So last night was a good relaxing time after taking a five hour drawing exam...or more like being in a 5 hour critiqe. it was thrilling. but anyway, after i got out, brad came over and eventually we headed over to his frien dave's where he proceded to sing sings about all of us. it was good times. after that, he and i decided to head over to waffle houe for a late night chat. so we head out of richardson with our arms around eachother belting out ""hands down"" by dashboard.  but we had to be quiet in front of the super punk kid with a mohawk because brad said he would probably kill us for singing dashboard. but as soon as we passed him, we started singing as loud as we could again until we got to my car. i don't know why, but it sounded like a good idea at the time. and being obnoxious is what we do best. when we got to waffle house, we just hung out for a while, venting and discussing our lives. we've both come to the decision that we're in college, we should be able to do what we want to do without having to explain ourselves or answer to anybody because we're only this age once and we might as well live it up while we can. we tried to play some john mayer on the jukebox but these two fuck asses put in an ass of songs and then peaced out, leaving us with nothing but endless country songs. so after brad got tired of me singing  ""don't take the girl"", he paid and as we were leaving, he proceeded to throw all of his change into the parking lot ( all 24 cents of it) and for some reason i felt compelled to run around looking for it because i never throw change away. after looking for a few minutes and only finding a dime, we realized that it was fucking freezing and ran back to the car. on the way back, we started to play christmas music and brad sang to all the songs in his oh-so-wonderful chris carrabba voice and i decided that he and i will make our own christmas cd: ""have yourself an emo little christmas"" --it will be fun times. and you all will want one. so after all that i went back to my room, realizing that we had spent a LONG time in waffle house, and started packing like a crazy person.
So this morning i woke up, packed all my stuff into the car, picked up brad, packed all his stuff into the car, and we headed home. it was quite the interesting car ride...at one point we had this very serious conversation about everything from people and the way the judge others for what they do, and the decisions they make to living your life with no regrets and making the most of it and at some points we were singing obnoxiously to all the songs on the radio. definently fun times.
Now i'm home and i'm so so glad to be here. just driving into town today, listening to christmas music and seeing charleston in the distance just made me smile. oh, i love this place.
Well it's time to hang out with the family and then decorate this tree!! :-D
Gotta take advantage of all this free time before all my jobs start on thursday!

So finals are coming to and end and the trip home to Charleston is so close I can barely handle it. I've goy my drawing final tonight at 6:30 and then I'm all done. But thise final alone has beena  killer. I have spend endless hours working on all of the projects that are due tonight : two perspective drawings, one peice of foil drawn with graphite, organic abstract with pointilism, and two charcoal still lifes. Yeah...I can't even begin to count the hours that I spent on all of those but it's in the hundreds...easily. So if I have to go through foundation review after all that ass busting, I promise you my professor will pay for it in a major way. and i'm not kidding. so that exam should take up a good 5 hours of my night ( yeah...critiqe for over a hundred drawings will be no easy task. ). But after busting my ass on all of that for so many weeks and hard core this weekend so last night i decided that I needed to go out an relieve some stress. So Ashley and I went out to eat at Outback and hung out there for a while and then we went out with all fo them to hickory tavern...that's right, after giving ashley sooo much shit for going there all the time, I finally gave in. and i am SO glad i did! i had SO SO SO much fun....and got pretty drunk while doing so ( but i guess chugging all that vodka can do it to you haha). I had so much fun with ashley and tons of fun with all those fun people from outback. yay for lots of fun times! :-D 
So after a night like that, it's wierd going home. I mean i'm DYING to go home but it's like i live two different lives now...and they both kick ass but it's wierd bouncing from one to another. I love it up here, with my roomates, and my sisters and all my other amazing friends and all the great times we've had together but i have those same things with people from home. And of course Chareston itself i love...and the town of Rock Hill is not much to talk about outside of WU. So yeah, it's gonna be sad going home. Because as much as we all want to, it's so hard to get together with everyone over the break. I mean I know we'll all stay in touch and then pick up where we left off right after we get back but it's so wierd. But then when i leave Charleston after the break to come back up here, i'll be so sad to leave everything and everyone there. So it's confusing and complicated but at the same time, so much fun to get to bounce back and forth between two places that I love and have so much fun in.
So I guess it's time to chill and get stuff together for thise final that I have. Ohh yay! 
I'll miss you WU people! Y'all have a teriffic break and I'll see you next year!!!

"event","I must say, my three roomates are quite funny and from time to time they make me laugh and have lots of fun times. Take last night for example... so it started when I thought it would be totally fun to talk to our suitemates outside of our windows...yes it would be alot easier and alot more normal to just walk to their room but oh well. So as I'm leaning out the window to talk to ashley and jenny, i lean too far over and knock the shelf on my desk off. Soo all of my shit (which happends to be ALOT) falls onto the floor. Lorna and Brad start hysterically laughing and continue to walk off and ashley and jenny laughed hysterically and then walked back into their room. I promise they were very concerned about everything that fell and could have broken. haha. So for the rest of they were all completely retarded because I was pulling an all-nighter and ashley & jenny were the only ones with exams. The whole night consisted of random conversations online ( yes, with the girls whose computers are all about 5 feet from mine), painting penises on the mirror with markers and the paint for my projects, grossing the fuck out of brad from time to time...but mostly that was jenny : ""carress my uterus!"", continuing to have conversations from the window ( but only this time jenny and i sat at our desks with the windows open and just screamed),calling brice and trying to convince him (unsuccessfuly) that he needed to marry jenny,oh i can't even remeber the rest but it was fun times.
So enough about those crazy bitches...it's exam week and that sucks. I can't wait for tuesday morning when i get to peace out! But the weekend before all of this was quite fun. hehe. The night before study day...yeahh...I have learned again that the combinations of heavy amounts of alcohol and a cell phone are not always the best combination. Sorry agan to all of you who I called and I love you all for either listening, laughing at the insane voicemails or just putting your phone on vibrate and ignoring me ( yeah thanks alot ashley. fuck ass. ) So needless to day study day wasn't quite as productive as I had hoped it would be due to a massive headache. Oh well. It was good times and since then, Lorna and I have been able to alleviate our stress each night with all the leftover alcohol. haha.
But i think now is the time to start studying for the exam i have in three hours...oh procrastination, you are my best friend.

"event","So the past few days have been quite intersting but oh well. Exams start this week so that means tons of work which then means tons of stress. And because of all of these art projects, i've already been stressing for a while but so is life. It just gets hard when youve got theses teachers telling you hard it is to actually make it and it's just awful. I mean I've already gone through so much because of swithcing my major and I know that this is exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. it gets so frustrating after working so hard on all of these projects and then not getting nearly as good of a grade as what i thought i deserved. i just hope i can make it through because I really don't know what I'll do if i don't. And then theres alwasy the issue of when I'll graduate. I mean already it's going to be a total of 5 years and I'm also thinking about grad school so who knows how much longer that'll take. And now I really want to go study abroad in Italy and i mean that shouldn't make me stay any longer but it's still something that i have to think about as far as school goes and what i want to dow tih my life.
So I've realized one thing about college in this year that I hadn't realized before. The amount of drama is insane. Most high schoolers are dying to get out of there because of the drama THEY have to deal with and I mean I never really dealt with too much of while at BE so I was thinking that college would just be absolutely perfect. Well that couldn't have been further from the truth. It's insane. I just wish that things around here wouldn't get so blown out of proprtion, miunderstood, taken out of context, etc. I guess all I can say is that I do the best to either avoid these dramatic situations. and what causes and when they do happen, I put the effort forward to solve them. But at the same time, I do not feel the need to go out of my way and beg to solve the situation. It takes everyone involved to solve a situation and no one else...because when people who aren't involved get pulled into it, it makes it even worse.
So home is looking more and more appealing as the days go by up here. I mean don't get me wrong, I love it up here and I've actually begun to love it more and more this year because of the things I've changed. I've switched my major which has made me happier than words can say. It is SO hard but I know in the end it will be so rewarding and SO worth it. I also think that rushing this year was one of the best decisions I could have made. After all the things that I have gone through this semester, I dont know what I would do without those Zeta girls that I love so dearly. I have the best big ( and g'ma!) ever and I couldn't have a better group of friends or be in a better sorority! :-) But all that aside, there are some things about Charleston that I will always love and will always miss while I'm not there. And especially since it's Christmas time I love that beautiful city and all the wonderful people that live there so much more. :-D
Yay for it almost being Christmas! And yay for procrastinating...guess it's time to get back to studying...

"event","So right now I'm pretty happy. I mean not lke psycho happy but content and not really for any reason...but I guess sorta haha. 
I mean I got alot of stuff worked out this weekend and Adam and I went out on a *date* one Saturday night and it was one of the most fun, wonderful times I've had with him in a while. Everything finally felt like it was normal again and I couldn't have been happier. We just sat at dinner and talked forever about everything and anything and it was amazing. And then we saw the Grudge...scary as shit! haha. But yeah it was definently a great night. 
The rest of the weekend was pretty good too--I started at Outback which is awesome because I will finally have money which is awesome especially since Christmas is right around the corner...well I mean not really but I have to start getting stuff together lol. And I was also happy because this weekend it got super cold ( well I mean compared to how it has been ) and even though I am a summer girl at heart, I can't help but get excited about cold weather because it means Thanksgivng and Christmas and it makes me super happy because those are my two favorite holidays. :)
So this week...well actually these next few weeks are going to be hectic as hell. Art projects out that ass as usual and all of the classes are crazy as hell, especially my drawing class, since they are all in the last month. I mean I register for my next semester classes on Tuesday--it's insane that this semester is almost over! And then there is all the sorority stuff that is leading up to Initiation ( only a little while away!!!) and the end of the semester. It's going to be crazy but fun as anything at the same time. And then of course the new job which will be some more time taken away from my already very limited time but oh well...money is money...
But it's time to finish up this laundry... thrills.

Last SUnday was Big sis/ Little sis find out and after a week of getting showered with presents we found out who our bigs were and mine is the one and only kate bloom. which means jeannie is my grandma! ( uhh...hot family! haha) So that was really exciting and since then we've had lots of interesting big/little bonding....reandomly beating up Jason and then staying up 'till like 5am talking about everything, harrassing the guy at chili's, lingere shopping... oh good times.
So everything with Victoria's Secret didn't work out so *fingers crossed* I will be starting at the outback in pineville soon and I'll get my mom off my back about being so broke haha. And it should be fun times because I'll get to work with Smashley! haha.
Halloween this year kicked so much ass! Yay! The first night we all went out I went as Miss America...last minute idea but I decided that the greek goddess idea was pretty lame so I ditched it. The second time we went out though really kicked ass...Kate, Rebekah,a nd I all went as Victoria's Secret angles...yeah pretty hot. Lots of fun. hehe.
Tomorrow Lorna, Jenny and I are going to Charleston! Yay! I'm gonna vote and then my mom is buying us groceries and making us food! YUM! haha.
Well it's time for a road trip with J-cah! Off to Clemson!

"event","* Life kicks ass right now! *
Thursday night I was originally supposed to go to work but that got cancelled (thank GOD) so I got to go the the white trash mixer with Kappa Sig which was pretty fun. We only stayed for a little while and then hit up the usual routine of drinking and going to the bar. I was very responsible and was actually sober by the time I got back to my room ( very rare for me haha ).
Then we left Friday afternoon for our ZTA retreat in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. All I have to say is that it was plenty of crazy fun. I got to know alot of the sisters so much better and it was definently fun times....the hot tub, getting NO sleep, shopping,spooning with Kate, China Bazaar, pissing everyone off when it was time to go to bed, the foreign waitress at the alabama grille, me and kates wedding ( uhh pandas ), and so much more...lots and lots of fun. Unfortunately I am still tired as hell and I have ass loads of work to do for midterms this week. Kill me now. But at least fall break is this weekend...home on Thursday afternoon and then road trip down to Florida with Jenny to see my wonderful Anna-Kate. Oh I can't wait!! It will definently be a much needed break after all the stress up here. The financial situation is much better since my job at Vickie's will be starting soon and my wonderful mother surprised me this week by paying all my dues for the sorority because she felt bad for me. *aww* lol. School is still tough but I mean it's worth it because I want to be an interior designer so bad and I do not want to become one of the many people the professors keep telling us will not make it. Especially since I have already changed my major. It's just getting tough now because between work, school, adam ( a year and a half on wednesday! ;-) ), and my other friends, there is NEVER a moment when I am just sittng around and doing nothing--which can be tough but I LOVE it. But a break will definently be good...and I think a short trip home and a road trip with jenny ( oh it will no doubt be crazy) down to Florida to see the cherished one (aka Anna-Katherine Shores lol) should be just about the perfect way to get away from it all.
Well it's time to prepare my portfolio for this drawing midterm. Peace out bitches.

"event","This weekend was AWESOME! :-D
*Thursday night was formal pledge-in for ZTA which took a long, long time but it was still really awesome, AFter that we all went to a party at some of the sisters' house where we all proceded to have SO much fun haha and then went to scandals. there are definently some blank parts in the night but it was definently fun to hang out with all my new sisters. But I have to say I LOVE my roomate SO much for taking care of me that night. * I'm so sorry Lorna!* But other than that little incident, it was all good haha.
*Friday I went to work which sucked ass as usual but then we had our new memeber sleepover at the Zeta house which was SO much fun! I definently got to know everyone so much better...especially the girls who stayed up with me talking all night long! Yeah...we never went to bed and then all went to Race for the Cure in Charlotte at 4:30 that morning. So we stayed out there, volunteering and everything 'till about 12. After that I went to work...and I just DESPISE that place. My boss had REFUSED to let me go on our retreat this weekend so after fighting and fighting, another one FINALLY letting me have it off. But because of that I am leaving Express and *thank god* transfering down to Victoria's Secret or Bath and Body. So hopefully all that will work out because I am broke as a mother fucker.
* So school is MAJOR stressful right now but hopefully it will start to get better. I just never thought that art classes would be so hard! Very naive of me I know lol. But at least the next two weekends will be good breaks from it all. This coming weekend is our ZTA retreat in Tennessee and then next weekend Jenny and I are going to see "" my cherished one "" *hehe* in Florida. OH I can't wait b/c I've missed my crazy Anna-Kate!
*So that's it for now...i'm off to do more homework...

Even though we got a noise ordinance for hammering our shelves together, it was so worth it because the room is so cute...and SO pink. And *everyone be jealous* her mom bought us a flat sceen, high definition tv. Oh yeah! haha. SO thats all going great and I'm so excited.
*This weekend was rush and after three days of no sleep and loads of stress, I got a bid to Zeta Tau Alpha! YAY! Oh I was so excited and I have the best sisters in the world! I love y'all and I am so excited about everything! :-D
*Well I think it's time to look for a new job....AGAIN! Yeah Express is pissing me off and SO not worth teh ride out to Charlotte. AH so aggravation...but we'll see.
* And Adam---I love you so so so much and I had the best time on Thursday night--you have no idea how much you mean to me!! XOXO

Thursday night we did the usual of partying and then going out to the bar. After that a few of us went over to the SAE house and i did my first keg stands! haha. But when we were getting ready to leave, I started hyperventilating and i couldn't breathe, couldn't feel my legs and was basically scared shitless. So they took me ot the hospital and I stayed there until like 6 in the morning--it was AWFUL. Apparently I had an acute allergic reaction to the liquor...damn. And from this point on the drama starts...people getting involved in shit that in no way, shape, or form involves them. Yeah--it's fucked up. But hey--I mean if you wanna talk shit about me...say it to my face. I'm a big girl and I can handle it. But other than that, I had fun hanging out with Lorna and Jenny ( porna and j-coochie! haha.)--crazy ass girls lol. So yeah...I guess thats it...lol.

"event","* Well this past weekend was amazingly fun. It started with the end of the SAE rush which Kimmie and I were hostesses for(since we ARE their ""groupies"" haha). Throughout the week we just hung out at the house, and basically just hung out with the brothers and got to know the pleges ( and Kimmie and I painted one kick ass table---the first person to break it gets their ass kicked! lol). Friday was bid night which consisted of a sit down dinner and slide show and later on, a huge party. The banquet was pretty fun...and we were given roses at the end for being hostesses which is always a good thing. :-) After that, we went back to the room to get ready for the party and of course...start drinking. We had to wait 'till about midnight for the guys to be given their bids ( we were freaking out because Adam had to stay in my room and he wasn't called until the last minute to go get his ). Needless to say, by the time that was over, Kimmie, Lorna, and I were pretty much gone (yay for lemon drop shots and boo for the bastards at McDonalds charging us for damn sugar packets!) and had to walk all the way over to the house. After that things got pretty damn fun. I don't remember all of it, but I do know that it was probably the first drama free night we've had up here...the rest I'll remember when we get our pictures back haha. So yeah...it was a great ending to a super fun week with all of our favorite guys and two of my most favorite girls:-D. * Congrats to Adam and the rest of the new SAE's! * So now Kimmie, Lorna, and I are planning on rushing SAE (haha) but in the meantime I actually have decided to go through sorority rush so I'm pretty excited about all that.

*Well that's about it. Now it's time to start some work.

Best quote of the weekend:
* So I stood up and told my teacher, I'm sorry, I can't do it. I've planned to make love to my girlfriend on that night."

But even so. this weekend was really fun. Kimmie and I spent the whole weekend over at the SAE house which was fun as usual and everyones decided that we (along with lorna) are going to be the first SAE sisters. haha. it sucked that adam wasn;t here this weekend but he did bring me a dozen pink roses when he got back. ;-) This weekend should probably be just as fun because this week is the fraternity rush and Kimmie and I are rush hostesses for SAE...it will definently be loads of fun. :-D

I've met some awesome new people...especially Lorna and Jenny ( I love you girls!) and the three girls I'm living with kick ass. (I must say--Kimmie and I have one very cure pink and green themed room!) It's also a major plus that this year Adam is up here with me. :-D
I have to start out by thanking everyone for such and awesome birthday! I had so much fun! We all went out to the SAE party after drinking a good bit and I felt like being festive (since it WAS my birthday) and wore the hot pink feather boa from josh and a sign on my shirt that said "" i'm the birthday girl"". After we got there, alot of the night is blurry but I was sick as crap the next morning and my legs hurt like hell from dancing ( I'm NEVER dancing with you again Lorna!). SO yeah---it was awesome. Classes stared Tuesday and they are tough but so great. I love the fact that all of my homework and exams will be art projects--I only have one non-art class. How cool is that?! But I already have a huge ink painting due on Tuesday and I'm looking forward to it but it's all very overwhelming. But other than that, as long as I try to remember not to stay out and get drunk on school nights and get two hours of sleep (haha), I should be fine. But it's Thursday so I better get some work done so I can go out tonight. :-D

"event","Well the other journal is broken or some shit so I guess I have to use this one so some people ( ummm....anna-kate shores! ) don't get mad when I dont update lol. But anyway...we got back from our big long vacation on monday and I have to say...it kicked ass. Miami was awesome, we layed out at the pool all day, got papered at this really cool hotel, and shopped at so many cute stores. The wedding in the everglades was really cool and I had lots of fun at that...seening all the family and everything. After a week in florida, we headed over to alabama for another wedding which was pretty cool but not that fun. So yeah... it was a long as hell vacation and i missed everybody tons but it was still lots of fun.
Now that I'm back I am getting so excited for school. I'm moving up a few days early so that I don't have to move in on my birthday (AUGUST 22...don't forget! lol) and also because I don't want to miss all the big parties the first week haha. And of course I'm dying to see all of my friends that I haven't gotten to see this summer. But I'm gonna miss everyone here so much...especially anna-kate. no one else understands me or makes me feel great the way she does...take today for example. I was so excited because I finally got a pair of black pointy-toed stiletto sling-backs. well ususally she's the one that I can tell all that to because she gets so excited for me and is so proud of me when I get good deals ( of course I am the same way with her. haha.) but today I tell her and she says...I was PROUD for you Lucky jeans, I was PROUD for your Lilly Pulitzer dresses, I was PROUD for you seersucker dress...but damn it...I'm all out of proud. I have no more for you."" Ahh yeah thats my best friend for you. haha. oh anna-kate i'm gonna miss your crazy ass. but I guess it's good that we'll be in two differnt states because that way we can be the only ones in each state with our awesome pillow shams. haha. good god were homosexually lame. but even so I'm gonna miss charleston and all my other buddies here ( you know who you are :-D ).
Oh by the way...Kimmie you are a psycho ass drama queen about this stupid hurricane. oh but i love you for it. but i swear to god i will disown you a roomate if you freak out like that this year. haha.
Okay I'm tired of typing and I have to go pack up for the trip to the Thrill with Kimmie this weekend (because I am going regardless of this stupid ass hurricane haha.)

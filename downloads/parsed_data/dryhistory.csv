where did i go wrong? at what point did my foot move a quarter inch to the left or right, causing this tight rope act to become no longer an act, but a struggle to stay on top of things? you are never, ever going to find anyone like me ever, again. the person i am to you is the person that i will never be to anyone else. i do everything in my power to keep you in good spirits and in a good place in life and this pattern still happens- when i have something good going on, this one particular thing, <b>this</b> happens. i just want you to be happy. i do everything i can to be good to you. until you open up to me and tell me why your opinion has changed so suddenly, i can't do anything but work this through over and over in my head, getting more and more frustrated. what do you care if your opinion might hurt my feelings? i'll get over it. if you're having to monitor what you say to keep me happy then there is something seriously wrong, here. i do so much for you. and what do i get? a belittlement of everything i do. you know that this has been a horrible few days for me, anyways. and what do you do? offer to hang out a little, maybe try and make things easier? hell no. why do that? why don't you say something and get somethin' started."

"event","its been so long since ive wrote in here!! well just had to say hi!!

Things i hate the most about people is when they do stuff just to get 
attention!! and when they have like five sides to them like one being 
punk one day and then being a nice girl the next!! or when like act 
like they like something  but they dont even know wut it is!! 
i just hate that! and also when people get ALL MAD OVER LITTLE THINGS
Its so dumh!!!"

"event","ok i cant wait till DC it is going to be so much FUN!!! (melissa) i want nate to let us see his six pack. (but he wont)
err. perris u shouldn't just assume that it is me or melissa cause there are more people that hate u .I'm not going to post something that mite hurt your fellings on line so everyone can see it. but i would just like it if u would not post that it was me (emily) on line cause then people mite think that i really did it when u don't know who did it, and i don't mean this in a mean way .i don't care if u dont want to be my friend but u could be mature and be nice to me and respect me cause i know that u dont want to fit  but a way not to fit would be to be nice (i'm not saying that your mean) but i'm trying to be nice to u and u just dis me. so if u say that i'm a bitch then u should think (im trying to be your friend and be nice to u) so maybe im not that bitch that u think i am.
love, emily"

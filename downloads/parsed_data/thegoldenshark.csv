"event","Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

How often at night when the heavens are bright
With the light from the glittering stars
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free
The breezes so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all of the cities so bright

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Oh, I love those wild flow'rs in this dear land of ours
The curlew, I love to hear scream
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks
That graze on the mountaintops green

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

"event","so i did some adding this morning just for fun, cause i love math, and of course the 10 parking lot - i mean freeway gives me plenty of time to do that.
here are some of my calculations.

<b>Average time of commute to and from school: 1.5 hours</b> (not counting this new, and wonderful rehersal schedule that makes my return trip alone 1.5 hours)
<P>
<b>Days in school: 240 </b>(i tried looking this up online, you would be SO surprised how fuckin hard this number is to find.... i mean i never actually found it. i just remember seeing this number in my counselors office, so i went with it.)
<P>
<b>therefore: 240 x 1.5 = 360 hours in the car a year!</b>
<P>
...but wait, lets take this further. cause i've been doing this for 4 years...
<P>
<b>360 x 4 = 1440 </b>
<P>
....and the final step...
<p>
<b>1440 / 24 = 60 DAYS!!!!! </b>
<p>
unless you spot an error in my math, or can actually find the number of days we are in school, i have spent 2 months in the car back and forth from LACHSA alone over 4 years!!!! (thats not counting any other rehersal driving, field trip driving, or just plain other commuting.... thats all on regular school days. wtf. 
<p>
seem like a waste of time?<br>
.....yeah i think so too.

i wonder how much time you've spent in the car on the way to school. i made an equation. ( i bet mr russell would give me extra credit for this, if i wasnt a TA)
<P>
<b>(avg round trip hours)(240)(4)/24=days spent in transit</b>"

"event","As some of you may or may not know, my new phone was attacked by sharp hard objects, and now has the aesthetic value of a crack house. Luckily i was able to buy phone insurance after the incident and i am now able to replace the phone for $50 flat. 

I call cingular today to see if i can go about replacing my fucked up shit. The woman approves my claim and proceeds to tell me that i can wait 1-3 business days for them to ship it to me, OR i can go to any one of these: (reads me the list of specific stores) stores in your ""area."" So i select the ""closest"" store near me and head out on my adventure.

Turns out the closest store is an easy 30 minutes away. i get there, pay the dick head parking attendant 3 fuckin dollars to park my baby, walk into the store, and find out that im at the wrong one, and that one im supposed to goto doesnt exsist anymore. I hop back in my ride and continue my adventure into beverly hills were i have been directed to locate another store that does replace phones. get there... no parking dick (pheew), hop out, march into the over crowded yupie store. theres a massive line. i stand and wait... the smell of money, and leather filling my nostrils. 

FINALLY!!!! my turn in line. i walk confidently and excited to obtain my new phone and with it, victory! after some talking i get the guy to go into the back to see if the phone is in stock... it is! hurray! ""...but i need to see some I.D. Are you Michael?"" (my father) no, but im his son... ""im sorry, if you want your phone you need your dad, or you need to change the insurance into your name."" 

WHAT THE FUCK! NOO!!!

so i call the insurance dicks to try and change it. ""im sorry, i dont know why the other representative told you, you could get your phone over the counter were not allowed to do that anymore.""

about $15 in gas and parking, and 2 hours later. i am empty handed and bored off my ass again.

"event","... yes lets talk bull shit for a few minutes.

Okay here are the facts as best as i can present them.
There was a party on Saturday, a cast / birthday party, and it was fun. There was only one supervising adult there, and she was spending most of her time out in front of the house. Now alcohol came into the equation, and a young lady was drinking too much, i mean wwwaaayyy too much. Well the inevitable happened, and she became so dangerously under the influence. She couldn't walk, stand, sit up, or talk. She had no idea what day it was, what time it was, where she was, and who she was around. It was time to talk emergency action. (she was also vomiting to the max) She went to the ER, and the parents were called.

HERE IS WERE THE BULL STARTS

The father, hysterically angry (and rightfully so) was not handling the situation in a proper or rational manner in the slightest. He was asking questions about the party and his daughter to me another friend of mine, and the mother chaperoning the party. He was also accusing the mother of suppling the alcohol, and me and my friend of feeding her the drinks. (My friend and I were the ones with her for a large portion of the night trying to help the situation, we carried her to the car, and the hospital- by the end of the roller coaster ride, we were soaked in her vomit.) ** But he has a right to be angry and irrational at this moment, because anyone would be if it was their daughter.

BULL (PART II)

Now a few days have past. The father is still writing letters of anger to the administration or our high school, and to the parents of the children attending the party. Letters expressing his negative views about the mother at the party. Try to wag the finger of blame at any poor sap he can nail the responsibility to. He proceeded to write a very distinct letter explaining that people were, ""... feeding alcohol..."" to his daughter, and that she was, ""... unknowingly poisoning her body..."" He also made several claims to the fact that his daughter would never do such a thing, and the he and his daughter are ""... like best friends..."" and that he might take legal action. ( i might post this email in a later post...)

RANTING AND RAVING (IN AN UN POLITE MANNER)

*cough*!!!!  What the fuck is going here, that a girl and her father can't fucking take responsibility for their own god damn plights, and misfortunes. It is apparent to me that you [the father, who will be referred to as ""you"" from here out] are NOT best friends with your daughter, or at the very least you aren't as close as you think you are, because this was no first timer. She was no ignoramus.

Being feed alcohol is also a god damn stretch to deal with as well, due to fact that everyone at the party was taking drinks from her, and she was fighting to get them back. DON'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT SHE WAS "" UNKNOWINGLY POISONING HER BODY"" alcohol, is alcohol, and she knew perfectly god damn well what the fuck was going on, and what she was drinking. --i would like to remind you that at one point she had to be sober, wether you like that idea or not.

It is very apparent to me that you have a large communication failure with your daughter, and that you are damn nazi, pressuring and pushing her so hard that she feels that this is the only way to release any pressure.

TAKE LEGAL ACTION?? Okay, your angry, no shit thats okay, but legal action will get you no were, and cause more hurt, stress, and sorrow for a family already plagued with such horrible feelings. Legal action with cost you more time and money than any thing you will make on the return...

Your angry, you hurt/ upset, thats fine. Your daughter learned a tuff lesson, the way she learned it was unfortunate, but there is no need to try and slam somebody else with the problem.

I know things will pan out and everything will be okay, because if the father, can't or won't settle down, there is a large group of VERY caring, and active students who know the truth and what is right, and are ready and willing to provide support.



**** Sorry to dish my problems out to people, just trying to get some shit off the ye ol' chest."

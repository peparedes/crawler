"event","When I logged on to LJ I was surprised to find how long it has been since my last entry. But then I have been so busy and so much has happened. I will keep it short. I graduated with my teaching degree and moved to Atlanta where I got a teaching job. I lived with my friend Amanda while I looked for an apartment splitting the cost of rent.
I met a guy. All seemed to be going OK. The school had some serious problems
however and after awhile I did not feel safe there. The guy I was dating turned out to be a bum and Amanda got in some trouble connected to the wrong people. Her Dad talked her into leaving town, leaving me without a room mate. Due to consolidation at my school I was going to have to move to a new school. With Amanda gone I lost my only real friend in town. That was bad enough but then her Dad thought it best that I move just in case the wrong people showed up looking for Amanda. Too much turmoil and I felt way out here on my own. Too much to deal with so I quit my job and moved back home.
It is so good to be back where things seem to have order."

If I stay here there will be a great temptation to continue to live here
in their house and not get my own place. I need to have my own place.
My summer job has really turned into ....well.....a job.
During the week I don't have a minute. I like the kids I am tutoring and Nanny for but it is every minute of the day 7am till 6pm. Thank goodness I have weekends off and they are paying me a very handsome salary.
The entire family is packing together today and leaving for a 4th of July family outing, so I am off work until next Thursday.
My weekends have been spent at the lake. I can actually water ski now, sort of. I'm not good but I can get up on the water and stay up, most of the time.
I use a ton of sunscreen so I haven't turned real dark like all the other people I boat with. 
One of my friends from my Katrina volunteer work came by in her RV headed to
Canada. She has a guy friend up there that she is getting serious about and
wants a ""summer of love"", her words. That sounds pretty good actually.
Amanda has invited me to Atlanta, she says I need to ""let loose"" this weekend.
Her definition of ""let loose"" and mine are light years apart but I'm sort of favoring her definition right now."

I had a chance to meet some of Amanda's girl friends. I was not used to seeing such open affection girl to girl. I'm not homophobic but I'm just not used to it.  
 We met up with the guys at this little place on Peachtree had something to eat then went to a couple of clubs dancing. This was only my third time seeing Derrick so after we had been at the second club about an hour we slipped away to a quiet place and just talked. We have been talking on the phone and 
e-mailing since our first meeting NYE. When I complete my student teaching in May I'll have the option of placement or searching for a teaching job on my own.
Derrick wants me to move to the Atlanta area. Amanda has offered to let me stay with her until I decide to move in with Derrick, her words.
Amanda took me to her church on Sunday morning. Good thing services didn't start until 11:00 because we didn't get in until 2. The singing was GREAT!!!"

something delicious. It smells like apple cinnamon. I get out of bed and walk toward the fireplace. As I pass by the rocking chair I see a note written in a familiar handwriting. It reads"" I'll be back soon, love you"".
Nice dream, I've had it several times. I wonder what it means?

"event","A lot has happened since I posted last. I had a great traditional Christmas with my family. I went Caroling twice and visited a lot of shut-ins and sweet old people. Church services were really great. Mom cooked a big meal and we had some family visit from out of town. I decorated the tree and the house so everything looked very festive. I went hunting with my Dad (walking and bird watching, I don't think we even had shotgun shells). We opened one present on Christmas Eve our choice. So I opened the smallest gift which turned out to be an earring necklace set.
I got a nice coat, an MP3 player and also 3 nice tops and a gift card to Footlocker. I also got a George Forman Grill so I will have one at school.
 I went to Amanda's for New Years Eve in Atlanta. We went to 3 parties.
The first one was pretty stuffy, people she works with. The second party scared me. It was a young crowd,the music was really loud, everyone was pretty tipsy and there was a lot of random kissing and touching and x-rated dancing going on.
I was glad when we left. It was one of those you hope you can leave before something really bad happens because you know it's going to, type of parties.
The finally party was at a huge house with a very diverse crowd. People were collected in different areas of the house doing completely different things.
One fairly large room down stairs was filled with people dancing. Another room downstairs had a group of guys watching football highlights. The living room and kitchen had small groups of people just standing around drinking and talking. The hostess was continuously telling people about her antique collection and sort of touring the house showing them off. They had a ton of food and also a for real bartender making any drink you wanted. A cute perky young woman was dressed in a french maid outfit keeping the empties picked up.
Amanda introduced me to a couple of her friends and I ended up meeting a nice guy who Amanda did not know, his name is Derrick. After we met we basically spend the rest of the evening talking and dancing. Derrick and I even shared the traditional NYE mid-night kiss. I was surprised when he kissed me because he was away getting drinks when the countdown occurred. I saw a blur and he had bolted from the kitchen in order to get into the kiss position prior to the expiration period.....which I am told is about 30 seconds after official midnight. I found the kiss very pleasant and hoped for another. I got my wish. When I was leaving the party with Amanda I found out that the NYE 30 second kissing expiration time period can be revisited for a second kiss just to confirm the first one. That night I learned things I did not know before !!!"

saving herself for marriage and she knows that I am doing the same.
She is feeling a little guilty and confessed something to me the other day that generated all kinds of questions. First her and her boyfriend recently decided to get married and plan to announce it to the families at the upcoming Thanksgiving dinner. In the meantime they have been getting hotter for each other and have had some pretty intense make out sessions (fully clothed). The other night while engaged in a deep lip lock her boyfriend pressed his knee up between her legs eventually resulting in ""the best orgasm of her life""( her words). Now she wonders whether she is still a virgin. ( Really, she asked that !!) I wanted to ask her if she thought a great orgasm was the line you cross when you lose your virgin label. If so then any woman who has successfully played with toys or has achieved pleasure solo could no longer claim to be a virgin. But I guess the fact that her boyfriend helped her with the orgasm, is her point. 
She also asked if I considered her and her boyfriend married in a common law kind of way. ( no)
She is going to see a gynecologist for the first time and plans to get some birth control pills so she will be ready when they get married. They want to wait and plan their family.
The whole conversation left me speechless. I really didn't say much.
I told her that if she is feeling guilty maybe she should cool it and get herself under control.  I told her that meanwhile I still consider her a virgin."

I had lunch with Lisa friday after my doctors appointment. She told me the most bazaar story. Her sister has been attending a group intervention session for women.

The sessions deal with addictive behavior and the participants talk about themselves and their addictions sort of like AA. Anyway her sister met a woman who claims to be a virgin but is addicted to exposing herself in public places. She got addicted on the internet playing with a webcam and getting high taking off her clothes and showing off. Anyway so Lisa, knowing that I am saving myself for marriage asked me if I had a webcam. Very funny.

are helping to dry up the infection so I don't have to spend as much time doctoring it each day. Lugging around extra weight on one foot and walking in and awkward manner has put strain on my back so I am feeling back pain I have not experienced before.
The first few nights with the pain medication caused me to have strange dreams. Most of the dreams I cannot remember but the ones I do are a little odd and even a little erotic (so hey maybe that's not so bad).
I had a little chat with Ryan. I am beginning to believe he has a fear of being alone. Every time I talk with him on the phone he has people over. Every time I have been to his apartment other people have been there. Even when I see him on campus alone he is headed toward a group.
He invited me to come over and offered to pick me up, then told me who else would be there. I would like to spend some alone time with him but he seems to be into group activities only."

"event","Friday night I blew off my homework and drove to Tallahassee to hangout with Lisa. The plan was to have dinner and a movie. We a had a fun  time talking over dinner and  got all caught up. Then on the way to the theater in the parking lot it happened. A car driving way too fast came around a corner of a line of parked cars and almost hit us. Lisa and I both jumped out of the way of the speeding car and then I fell. I had a sudden sharp burning pain shooting up from my ankle.
I stayed on the ground holding my leg and watching my ankle swell.
Lisa got her car and took me to the closest emergency room. When we got there it was already crowded. They gave me something for pain and an ice pack but did not get to me right away. After almost and hour I got into the processing part where I had to give them my credit card because I have no insurance. We then waited another 30 minutes before a PA came in and began to torture me by pressing on the area that hurt. X-rays revealed that I had fractured a bone in my foot.
We spent 3 hours in the emergency room and I left wearing a big boot and crutches. I stayed with Lisa Friday night. Saturday Dad and his friend came and picked up me and my car. Did I mention it is my right foot. The big boot is so wide it spreads out across the accelerator pedal and part of the brake at the same time, so I can't drive. Sunday Dad took me to Emma's. Emma is so sweet. She doesn't like to drive that much but has agreed to take me to school every day. I hate depending on others and hate imposing on Emma. Yesterday was a real ordeal trying to get around at school with my books. It was painful and frustrating. I'm discovering that there are sets of stairs everywhere. I had no idea how much I just take getting around so much for granted. I hate this."

anyway. Gabby had an airplane delay with their connecting flight so instead of arriving at 5:30pm it was more like 10:30. That pretty much tanked the plans to drive to Atlanta for our first DragonCon. So Gabby and her sweet hubby who I had just met for the first time let me crash on the couch in their hotel suite. Saturday morning Gabby and I woke up late. Her hubby had already gone to work. I must have really been out of it, I had no idea anyone was even up.
The first thing out of her mouth, Gabby screamed ""let's go to the beach!!"". So, we got up and cleaned up, repacked her small suitcase and hit the door.
A few hours later we found my cousins place where Mom and Dad and Gabby and I were assigned to stay for the family reunion. Then before we could escape to the beach we got an invitation to go open water fishing. We went and had a great time. Gabby caught a shark that we let go. Everyone else caught at least one fish including me. So that night we had a fish fry first then all the family musicians broke out their instruments
and played and sang. It was really fun.
Gabby and I even got some beach time when we got back. We also hit the beach early in the morning and late Sunday afternoon.
In between was church and the biggest potluck I have ever seen.
I have no idea who all the people were but I guess I'm related somehow. I met cousin after cousin and now can only remember a few names. Gabby said that this was the best American experience she has ever had."

I feel so fortunate for my health and I feel blessed to have spent an afternoon with such a sweet gentleman."

"event","When I read a really good book I paint a picture in my mind.
Then they come out with a movie from that book. I then have to re-paint that picture in my mind. I also have to fill in where the movie maker errors or deletes important parts from the book. Or worse he adds things that are not there. 
An additional problem that comes with making the movie version of a good book is that after seeing the movie the characters in the movie become the characters in the second or subsequent books. So when I read the second book in a series like Harry Potter I place the motion picture figure in the book as I read it. The actor becomes the book character. So what is wrong with that? What happens when that actor performs another role? That pure character becomes another character. It messes with my mind. And that is exactly what Daniel Radcliff is doing. What could be the most unexpected thing that could happen? How about the Harry Potter movie character is going naked. Not in the next Harry movie. No. In another role, onstage in London.
Read about it. http://news.aol.com/entertainment/articles/_a/harry-potter-star-plans-equus-debut/20060728104009990001?ncid=NWS00010000000001
I'm not sure I am ready for this, but for all of those who have been waiting for Harry naked..........there ya go."

My trip to Atlanta with Amanda was almost all a freebie and Gabby cost almost nothing. Staying with Amanda during DCon
isn't going to cost me, so I should have a little spending money this fall when I go back to school. 
I've got an invitation to go boating and water skiing this weekend. I have tried water skiing before. I think I was not only bad but at the same time I was great entertainment for the people on the boat. If people talk for months about the unusual positions you put your body in while water skiing that is probably a clue that you are not too good. I'm going anyway."

I must have lost weight again because the Six costume that I tried on before fit this time. I met Cloe's guy friend Fritz who is (cute) trying to find a popular character who has a love interest. He plans to hit on whoever is wearing the match at DC. Locke Cole and Wakka were his favs. Cloe has a friend who used to work for a store that sold the games.

I watched Charlie and Beverly argue and fuss at each other yesterday continuously interrupting work to add items and debate their travel checklist for next week. They are definitely accountant types, making their list and checking it twice. They are definitely not the, cram some clothes in a bag and go,kind of couple.

She will be working but she told me that I could be her slave and clean and cook for her while she is at work, earning my room and board. Then we could party at night. Works for me. I have been to Atlanta airport to pick up Dad and I have been through the airport changing planes but I really know nothing of Atlanta.

Mom finally got up with me at about 4pm about 30 minutes before he arrived. I freaked out, naturally.
Then I rushed around getting dressed and getting makeup on and trying to get the house tidy.
As it turns out Edward is a very nice guy. He is pretty rigid and totally lacks humor but is a very nice guy. Anyway Edward is taking trips to different college campuses located close to family members. He was actually headed north and got the ok from Mom to stay here. They all stayed the night at my cousins in Florida friday night. He knows a lot about the family and told me what to expect at the reunion. Edward must carry his own food because he ate nothing last night that I offered and had nothing this morning before he departed."

I'm a terrible patient. I want to be on the go. Besides, I have been sitting around missing Gabby and feeling sorry for myself.
I do that when I am sick. I have been thinking about friends and relationships a lot lately. I've been watching Mom and Dad and how they interact now that Dad has retired from his job in Atlanta and moved back home. He still works but he is home every night. It's been great having Dad home. Mom is just glowing. I watch them. I am beginning to get the idea what it means to be married to your best friend. I always used to think what a cliche but it is wonderful to see them together.

The air was fresh and the breeze was wonderful. Then we had an invitation to sleep in the living room but opted to sleep on the deck. It was great.
The second day at the beach we explored some beach shops in the afternoon. We spent the entire morning on the beach walking and sunning then went back in late afternoon until sunset. We ate nothing but sandwiches, fruit and junk food the whole trip.
Gabby bought two bottles of wine for Claus and Lidia and helped them drink one. I had diet Coke.
We went out to a club the second night and actually danced with some guys from Georgia. It was fun.
The third day was all beach until we departed for home about 4pm. It was the best beach experience I have ever had. That's because of Gabby. I learned a lot about relaxing and going with the flow. She is just great fun to be with and I never know what might happen next. I wish she lived here, I miss her already."

Her life is totally unscripted totally unplanned. This is the way it happened. We arrived at the beach, carried our stuff out to the sand and began getting settled. Out of nowhere this old man wanders by with a metal detector. Gabby starts speaking German to him just like she knew he would understand. Much to my surprise he did. They started talking and continued for 10 minutes. Then suddenly she told me to pick up my stuff because we were moving. She introduced me to her new friend Claus and told me that we were going to his place down the beach. When we arrive a few minutes later Claus introduced us to his wife Lidia. We used their sun deck, we had lunch with them and stayed two nights with them sleeping on their deck. I only occasionally understood bits and pieces of the conversation they had with Gabby but she talked with them non-stop. When we left on the 3rd day Lidia cried like she was losing a child.

So I told him after I cleaned Emma's house I had planned to stay with her since I had something to do in town the next day. (I had a date with Eric the next day.) He agreed to come over and pick me up at 6. Anyway we went to his nice big 3 bedroom house with no furniture where he lives alone. The big surprise was that he bought a Jacuzzi. It is big enough for 6 people. Here is a guy who has no furniture, and he buys a Jacuzzi. He turned it on and wanted me to get in with him but I declined. Maybe next time like when I have a suit with me.
  On Saturday Eric and I met early and just walked and talked like we did last week. But when it started getting hot and I told him I probably needed to get home. He asked if he could follow me and asked if he could meet my folks. I was surprised to say the least that he would want to drive two hours just to meet my folks? But he did.
He stayed for supper then we all just sat and talked about everything. He is a great conversationalist, which I knew and now so do my folks. Mom and Dad like him. He left at 10pm.

Sunday was a fun time. After church the singles went out to eat
and mingle. We intentionally sit next to somebody we don't know
so we can get to know more people. The guy I sat with must have a special friend because some girl watched me the whole time.
 I wish Gabby was going to be here over the weekend so we could go to church together. I would love to get her impression.
I talked with Gabby again today. We confirmed her flight and arrival time tomorrow. She said she had a surprise to show me.
When I pressed her, you won't believe what she is bringing with her.  
In spite of her bizarre side I can't wait to see her."

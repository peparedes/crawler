"event","well as usual my day starts off with waking up at 6:40 and then passing back out until about 7, finally gettin up and then goin to school for 1st period!!! which is a complete bitch and after this year im done with carey!!! dont get wrong, i have so many memories in those halls and classrooms and i'll never forget but i wanna LEAVE!! after 7 periods of bullshyt its off to dance i go!!! after dance im home and during the week no1 is really around so i sit home!!! except for tonite!! my friend danny who i havent seen in forever stopped by to say hi! well little did i know that when my dad came home he was gonna bugg the fuck out!!! he yelled at me and told danny ""get the fuck out of my house!!"".  

let me fill u in on danny...hes got a girlfriend and nothing was even goin on! we were just catching up because we havent seen each ( i think i said that already)... well now i know that my dads a complete syco!  

on days like these i sit home and think!!! i like to think, its a cool thing.  lay down put on some tunes and think!! yea well todays thinking consisted of 2 things... 1.  Why do things such as backstabbing friends have to happen? 2.  Why did brian have to go to florida this weekend!!? LOL..  everyone tells me that its cute that we still talk but in the back of my mind i have my doubts.  Going off to college next year is a major step in life.  Im going to meet soo many new people! and when that happens hes not even gonna be a thought in mind (unless we start goin out before i go to college!) you never know what lifes gonna bring along...

This weekend just may suck!!  tomorrow (friday) i dont know WTF is goin on! i dont know if im gonna be forced to go out with my mom, or if im meetin up with dee, ana, michelle and catherine to start prom shyt (whole other paragraph) or chyllen with my biffel jenna<3.. Saturday i have work all day and Sunday too.. Thank god that i have monday off BUT i have dance!!!  grrrr then its right back to school tuesday!

Prom - everything that was said before x-mas break has yet to happen!  it was said that we were goin to start all this shyt right when we came back to school!  yea well nothings been done.  i mean ive done a lot buts its all on my own!  ive looked for buses (theres about 30 of us going together), and today i looked for houses!!! ***ANYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT RENTALS IN THE HAMPTONS LET ME KNOW ASAP*** 

well thats all i have to say for today...peace, im out...

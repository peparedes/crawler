"event","I am not very good at seeing the truth. At best, I am only much-too-slowly getting better at recognizing it as I age, and I'll probably always feel like an infant facing reality until I die. Yet, despite my handicap I love truth, maybe because it is so allusive and unpredictable to me, so I constantly study it through countless trials and errors. But thinking about this weakness in me, I realized that it's actually an arguably helpful and beneficial attribute of my character. I'm a fool, sure, but at least I recognize my ignorance. And admitting that you are always going to be a slow-learner of life establishes quite an honest position to begin with. You can trust me because I'm not going to assume I know something for sure, there-by misleading us both, unless it's obvious to me in my limited (circumstantial) experience that I have the best guess within a reasonable vicinity. It baffles me when I see intelligent people blatantly disregarding the most obvious fact universal to us all; no one knows everything or likely even that much about what they think they know so far. People mostly don't know much of anything, relatively speaking. It's a bummer but kind of like ignoring cancer not to accept it. Anyway, if I know anything it's only been my frustrated stupidity that has given me the notion to find out. What is a person who isn't curious anyway? I'll never relate. And maybe they know all they need to know, those who are eager to settle into a proximate paradise of routine and predictable security. But although I am probably utterly ignorant of their circumstantial expertise, that is (in this case) validating their end-game, at least I know that I'm wrong generally... almost entirely. Because that one cluster of negligible arrogance-fostering pseudo-knowledge you use to hang your hat on, whether it be about business, engineering, or just your meager circumstantial life experience, will grow in you just like unchecked cancer until it's too late to reclaim the major portion of your miraculous life which you could have used to realize the entirety of your potential as a sentient being. Knowing when you are wrong seems to be much more infallible than being certain you are right. In fact, the only people I trust are those that are admittedly wrong. They are the only ones who have the potential to know truth at all."

"event","In the summary of my online dating profile:

My Critique of Misplaced Values at the Expense of Genuine Relationships and Authentic Originality in a City of Industry:

No Use for the Genuine?
No Market for Authenticity?
What, then, could the point of all this be?

I'm unique, as are you, as are we all. It's just not always so evident with some. Authenticity is not a fixed quality of social beings. It requires will. My life's work is an excavation, an exploration into ever-expanding territory of self. Oriented by the past, directed by the future, and driven by authenticity in present. The provisional archaeologist gradually becomes the indefinite and boundless pioneer of self-discovery/advancement/innovation/re-invention/(everything new).

Finding yourself and developing yourself are the privileges of being yourself, which is the fail-safe method of liberating your true uniqueness. It's also the only truly original thing left to do, and the best, most interesting, and fulfilling way to be. What's more, being your authentically unique self is the only way to genuinely know & appreciate someone else. If you can't clean the inner lens, it matters-not how well you polish the outer glass of a telescope. But I'm not saying I have never lied or been fake, I have. Falseness get's you by, can even lead to success, but an empty and brief sort, that ultimately is a waste of your life & efforts.

I guess I feel the need to say all this because, somehow in this vast and varied social landscape, lasting-meaningful connections have evaded me for the most part. Or have I evaded them? My real conviction is that many people are too busy 'succeeding' to live with real presence. They simply aren't interested in something genuine which has nothing to do with their pursuit of more-ness ad-infinitum. I, too, try to move onward and upward in my life, but success for me, isn't found in wealth or social status. Unfortunately, I think those are probably the ultimate goals of most of my neighbirs. But money is not a goal, it's a tool. Real goals include: finding yourself, loving yourself, expanding yourself by learning from others who aspire likewise, and finally, truly being able to know and love other people. Status/fame/egoism is not given in respect. It's just grossly misplaced power, derived from wealth-magnetism or some other strange form of obsession for identifiable faces. These successes are empty. Achieving these 'goals' only makes it that much less likely to have meaningful human relationships. It's all fueled by our lowest carnal urges. What's the point of money, status, even power if no one (including yourself) really knows you, let alone loves you? The fleeting fun and illusions of enduring admiration? HA! ...You. In a mansion. Alone... Happy thanksgiving. :)
All I know is that cool-unique people with real personal interests and unpretentious sense of humor will be welcomed members of my L.A. gang. I know you're out there in the vastness of variation. Don't be afraid of really knowing someone without any superficial personal gain. Authenticity avails.

""Let yourself be silently drawn
by the strange pull of what you really love.
It will not lead you astray.""

-Rumi

I occurred to me not too long ago that, even if being totally honest attracts no-one (always probable), what's the point if someone was interested in some false ideal of me anyway? Being yourself (which is harder than you may think it is) is the only way that you will ever meet people who truly appreciate you and who you feel the same way about."

""It was vanity that fueled the revolution, freedom was only a pretense"" (or some shit) 
-Napoleon Boneparte

Fuck that.

Yesterday I designed a creative, yet effective (eye-catching, cool, concise) warning sign. The creamer powder for the fancy automatic coffee-drink machine ran out at work and I felt it imperative  to create a disclaimer, and it was fun. I work in a creative industry, where free-thinking is paramount. And so... my tasks reflect that mindset, but always in good taste. In that spirit I drafted this little gem in a time of necessity:

NO CREAMER
SO...
NO CREAMIE
STUFF
S O R R Y

Today... it's gone, 
and not just gone but REPLACED.

(I would provide a photo, but all the evidence was destroyed)

I asked a source that had been close to the incident if they knew who instigated such a swift debunking of my functionally spot-on creative expression, or for any explanation available at all. She did tell me who found the display 'disagreeable.' I can't say who (it was someone way high up the corporate ladder). My confusion and dismay was not satisfied simply by his status. I had to know WHY on earth there was such adversity to my practical work of art, and so... that is what I asked them next. The informant seemed to be concerned with my tract of questioning and tried (in vain) to discredit the motive fueling my indignation. Said insider, revealed that she over heard someone say that it should be typed, rather than hand written. This was plausible, but if that is what was proposed, then it was not implemented. The replacement sign was written on the same paper (a small post-it note) with ink as well. It was obviously not the print vs. type theory. That would be the definition of insanity. My resolve remained. Furthermore, the new note was harder to read, too wordy and tactless in design. I asked a few others about the situation and they all either clung to their ignorance like a buoy in the shark-infested water or simply skirted the issue. Nevertheless, eventually I felt that I had a pretty concrete idea about the true motive for desecration of my art. They were afraid of it, of what they perceived to be the dangerous, insidious, corrupting, and subversive nature of it. They saw a perversion of reality. I TAKE ISSUE. 

This is my statement in response to acts unfounded, inconsiderate and destructive. It is a protest, and a declaration!

The only people who would find that friendly message generally offensive are not actually personally offended themselves. Males. What's more, finding it offensive is more offensive than the sign itself. What is on the mind of a man who sees perversion in every nook and cranny of a building? I am a man, and though (now that it has been declared) I can see the insipid trail of dirty thoughts that could lead to such a mistaken interpretation, I had no such degrading notions or motives to inspire my work. Also, I maintain, even after objections, that there is nothing suggestive at all, purposeful or by default. No matter. This is not the issue. The REAL issue is freedom of expression and knowing when a creation adds to the spirit (morale) of the environment it resides in or when it degrades it. Our clientele are artists, working in a field of eccentricity exposure. We only benefit from functioning on the edge, as dull as it really is. But I will not be mistaken, I too believe we should always maintain a healthy distance from uncomfortable and alienating acts, so that we can all work together, and with those who we provide services, but we must NEVER become boring, for that is the death of inspiration, therefor progress & innovation, and in-turn... gradually brings about irrelevance, unsustainability and finally... failure. This is the importance, the reason to take issue. Do not roll over in times of suppression for the pressure will only increase. To those who remain quiet, in the zen world of neutral excuse. YOU ARE NOT SAFE ON THE FENCE (that is where the mortars fall short).

And what room is left outside of this perfect machine once it's been designed so well to fit the form and function of the outside world? How much of us is left to our lives once this social necessity is fulfilled? My recurring question is why? Is it just to fit into a structure? Is it so we feel that we are valid human beings? People will do whatever is expected of them in order to belong no matter where they are from. Some structures are more severe than others. In this lovely nation, we simply have to buy in to the social game. The race. The soul for comfort trade-off. We may be the world-wide forerunners of the freedom to be yourself but the unspoken rule is that your identity is taxed as you rise. You are shaped. By the time you're in the government, you are a distorted and misused replica of who you were in your youth.

"event","So, last night... or I should say this morning, I had a dream wherein I was at some kind of basketball camp for my special high school (I was back in high school) up in some odd town in the mountains. There were terraces and lots of supported cliff-side buildings and balconies, including the court we were playing on... So Lebron James and some other more veteran shooting guard or whatever were running this thing. I quickly noticed that we were basically all just shooting around. I was thinking damn, I get a chance to play with these pros and they're off talking and we're all just fumbling around trying to take shots. So I go up to the guy that wasn't Lebron (because I don't really like him and don't believe he cares about us kids) and ask him (the older veteran), ""should we should start running some drills or something?""
Him: ""Naaah, you guys are more the perimeter type-players... you just shoot and stuff""
---There were about 15 of us
Me: ""Uhm, well what about if we get screened on a play or something?""
---I was trying to force him to actually coach us but he obviously was annoyed by this unexpected involvement
I think at this point he starts babbling some incoherent excuse as far as my comprehension goes. I get frustrated/stop wanting to hear it and grab a ball and start running toward the basket and challenging both of the pro-NBA youth coaches as well as my young peers but I'm out of shape and flailing wildly... losing my dribble only to fling a shot up that doesn't even come close. Just about then some even worse and more out of shape (or just mentally challenged?) kid somehow bounces a ball over the 20 ft fence and it falls down a huge canyon. We all go look at it. This place was incredible. Something like you'd see in a ps3 video game where they design fantasized ancient cities in the sky. In any case, Lebron James was an incompetent in my dream as he is in real life and I wanted to remember it.

Interesting. 
I miss this community. I think it's time again to use this for what it is, a journal. Anyways, I need to start flexing my creative/reflective writing muscles and get back in shape! It was unfair of me (and the millions of others) to abandon this wonderful forum for deep personal thought because Myspace, Friendster, and finally the juggernaut--Facebook deluded my precious imagination by turning on the virtual reality TV (the social network obsession). I, for one, am ready to start fleshing things out instead of just updating and commenting. Those are great tools for quick and fun, and simultaneously direct and broad, communication but what about the real thoughts? The fact that no one will probably be seeing this doesn't bother me either. Not that the thought of someone seeing it will. I just think this is the kind of place where we all join up and post whatever thoughts we deem thinkable and readable for ourselves and our cohorts with the same understanding that this is what LJ was designed for. So I am back... If I can remember to use this thing again...

Maybe tonight I'll get high and write to get the creative juices flowing... though I'm beginning to fear that that only hastens the loss of creativity which naturally occurs in the brain (maybe just mine?)."

"event","Most of the truth, we do not see. Even those of us trying so hard to follow the most common paths of human life are quickly found to be blind when dissected. This, assuming the common path is the most natural state of human truth. A Lie. We seem to have an affection towards tricking eachother, our fellow humans. Everything we do in a massive quantity is some kind of sedative. We are and will always be afraid of the unknown variable; the one person that defies our simplistic and time-corrupted & semented logic. The more you examine, the more you find to be a mystery. It's no wonder so many ""normal"" people live lives of oblivious acceptance and that artists (those who attempt to REALLY see) are so tortured on a consistently life-long and by-nature basis. And by the way, a true artist doesn't mearly try to see one thing or another. The struggle, and the impossibility, is trying to see in all directions (possibilities) at once. It takes a great deal of mental stamina to cross the lakes of miss-direction and corruption which stunt all of our minds. If you come from anywhere you have a bias towards life. Only the alien who sees us all at once and in clear resolution could come close to knowing the truth of humanity. Sit still for a while, tired, but not too tired to think and ask yourself ""what do I really want?"". The internal journey to the answer of this question could take an eternity but if you are truelly willing to let go of all realized biases, you will be a million times ahead of most humans within the first 5 minutes of thought."

"event","While many people live their life for success, neglecting the question of who they really are, I struggle day to day with that question, accomplishing nothing in my earthly life. For me, my weakness, I guess, is fear and a less than ambitious notion of the processes of success. I know it's important to be productive in one's life but I don't truely believe or understand it. Maybe I really am comfortable in my very un-honorable situation. Life seems to push most people on a track towards being a part of ""normal"" society, getting money and feeling like ""one of the guys/girls"" but, somehow, I escaped feeling this pressure in a significant enough way. You could call me selfish, lazy, condoned, ignorant, self-destructive, apathetic, out of touch, or mentally challanged. These are all valid theories and they are all at least somewhat true. But there is one thing I know for sure and it's that I'm on a path for truth. And not just a path for truth about the stock market or who's fucking who, but a deep, all-inclusive truth. And I maybe might believe that most of these (negative?) characteristics I have as of now are in direct relation to my quest for truth. Maybe it's meditation versus living? Thinking versus acting? It's easy to get jealous of people who are ahead of you in the race for more money and power in the world. Jealousy is easily defeated, though, by even beginning your own path to your desires. My desire just happens to be for awareness of what really matters. Because I don't have that, I tend not to hold much stock, as of now, in the day-to-day integration of one's self into society. I don't care that you have a better car, are getting your business degree, live in your own big house, screw shallow attractive opportunists and can buy just about anything. You got all these things in spite of who you really are. That neglected child of who you are probably hates the successful, materialistic, loveless & souless you that you've nurtured into adulthood. You let the tool (money) become the goal (happiness) and now you've got the life but no reason to live it! You probably never even thought about the idea of finding yourself. That's probably why you found it hard, and eventually gave up on, understanding much realness about anyone else. You only ever want to find out enough about someone/something to compliment your own pre-existing prejudgements. Judgements that were set up by your mindless volunteered slavey to a system that has little-to-nothing to do with humanity. And I mean inner humanity, not social human expectations and trendy corrupted popular opinions. The fact is, for me, even in my worst pain of struggling to find myself, I am content in doing so. You will never be content because you must keep up the production rate. And so you will always want more... consume more and in turn, fuel the society machine until this fuel which polutes and corrupts the next generation's souls will flow through the empty shell which could have been... you. I'm probably just trying to justify and glorify me being a total loser. And maybe I'm masking jealousy, because I haven't really fulfilled or even begun my life the way I see it, but that doesn't make this truth any less true to me. At least I got that."

Mild pain kinda just becomes funny when you know it will eventually pass. Plus it's nice knowing that being comfortable isn't the only virtue of life. I guess once you get old you're kinda over the struggle. But I'm young so I'm gonna experience it. It seems like a real artist should see a use for every color (etc.) given the right timing and environment. Ugly is still a factor of life. Pain is still a factor of life to be expressed. You don't even have to dislike it. Imagine that. 

After my friend Roger got jailed for drinking and driving they asked him ""So how'd you like spending the night here, was it worth it?"" (paraphrased from memory) expecting him to say ""No it was horrible"". Instead he said something to the tune of ""I dunno, it was an interesting experience"". They said ""It was a bad one though"" and he said ""No it was just an experience"". I guess they (the lady signing him out) just kinda rolled her eyes as he left. I know they are trying to make a point not to come back for his own good. But obviously no one wants to pay a shit load of fines and lose their liscense for a year. He was naturally just making a comment about living life for what it is. He didn't ask to be put there (I should say ""expect"") but he took it as just another experience. I suppose no one can take every struggle as a positive thing but there are plenty of things I and many others take way too seriously in light of the fact that we are going to live through them and go on to struggle through another day."

"event","I'm not sure why I picked this sunday night to finally add a real entry to this journal. I guess it's because today sucks. I'm officially that guy that parents (my oldest sister, Marla) tell their kids ""I don't ever want you to turn out like him"". For some reason my loserness is some kind of burden on Marla to where she tells her kids, whom I love and who love me back, that I'm basically a loser and lazy and nothing to look up to. I'm not saying she's wrong. I just don't like my family turned against me. I really don't like little kids who don't have jobs or any real responsibility calling me lazy and pointing out every little thing they don't find up to their parent's standards because they have been programmed with this sort of smart ass superiority complex. That isn't a bash on the kid's either. Kids are kids and these ones are great in all their natural wisdom and charm. It's just the damn authority figures...

'Sides that, the day was miserably hot and sticky and I couldn't do anything to feel clean. This only added to the feeling of being lazy and worthless. Then off to work I go where Mike and Marla had told my boss, who they know personally, that I supposedly fall asleep watching their kids, which I hardly believe. The kids probably saw me put my head down on a table for 2 seconds cause I was fucking exhausted from switching my schedule of sleeping to walk over to their house in the morning and do everything they ask of me and later told their mom I was ""sleeping"". Not to mention I got paid SHIT. On average probably $3.50 an hour. This while I didn't have a job or any other way to earn money. This while my girlfriend got paid something like $8 and hour by them. All of this I basically could care less about after it's all said and done, but then I guess it's not ALL said and done. They have to go talk shit about me, the practically free help. Her brother, his... who cares. 

Whoops.

Then off to work. Work starts off fine. I'm lazy from the day but the store (Papa Pepperoni) is slightly cooler than my house. Then I get to talking about music with my manager. I have a couple mp3 cds of soul and funk music which I tend to put on while I'm at work cause no one else seems too concerned with the stereo situation. But then my manager just HAS to start saying patronizing shit about the music cause he doesn't understand anything outside of his world. His airforce trainee world. I kinda slipped and said some reverse racist-ish freedom of speech loose lipped comment like ""once you listen to funk, soul, jazz, blues etc. most white music doesn't seem as good"". This kinda comment only works when who you're talking to feels exactly the same way. He then inturn made some asinine comment about how if I said that in uhh... Sharksville... (I can't remember the city name) that I'd get my ass kicked. I said something like ""why are they skinheads or something?"" and he said ""yeaaaah"". And I just said... ""OOOOK."" Cause who gives a fuck what redneck skinheads think anyway? And then I started to get back to saying ""maybe that wasn't the best way of saying that"" and he kinda stopped me and said some cliche shit that went ""how about you write your opinions down and if I feel like reading them I will"". Damn. The workplace just turned into another mental & emotional fucking workout center. It was no longer the ""you know nothing about me, thank god you can leave me personally alone"" zone. It wasn't the escape from the insanity, nagging, assholism and insanity house which I live in. It was now another burden. So I was basically silent the rest of the time. For some reason the fact that I wasn't allowed room to explain myself really really upset me. He really took the soul out of me. I didn't feel like listening to music and I definitely didn't feel like talking anymore. 

This happened before at a house in Long Beach when talking about music. It was slightly different in context but I was arguing with a would-be lawyer so it wasn't a measure of the truth but just who could fuck over the other's argument and bury them deep enough to where it was more work to recover the point than just move on. I try to make it a point never to argue to be right but to argue for what you honestly believe it the truth. That sounds like a dumb comment but the fact seems to be that many people just kinda choose the most advantageous ""truth"" for them and argue it. That's why many people have a really hard time being wrong. I'm very opinionated but I've also shred the fear of being wrong in light of the truth. i could some this up and say ""Be right in light of the truth not in spite of the truth"". Boy that's a good one. I better make it into one of those quotation books. *time travel machine sound*.........Plus I was drunk (at this house in L.B.) and you'd have to have some patience and willingness to get what I meant for it (my opinion in your mind) to work. 

This really is just the latest in a string of ""off days"". It started from a positive. Sorta. I was planning on taking the bus to Colleen's and decided to actually read something for once in a LONG time. I went and picked a book called ""Notes To Myself"" off this bookshelf in the guest bedroom at my house just on the notion that it looked introspective (obviously) and it was one of the first books I spotted. I read for an hour before I left and then for the 45 minutes or whatever it took taking the buses. It was a really cool book. The author (whom I forget the name of, of course) reminded me of myself. Maybe that was the point. Anyway, I wont get into the specifics of the book except to say that it was kind of clearing up a lot of thoughts for me and sorta giving me a mental direction to head in, which I haven't had in a long time. Well I ended up leaving the book at Colleen's and I feel almost more directionless now that I've started the book and can't finish it. I feel sorta lost. I just wanna absorb it. I'm sure most of my actions as of late are almost in opposition of what I know (somewhere deep down) I should be better than. Then some dude kinda passively wanted to fight me at Jerry's more chaotic, less fun than the last one, but still awesome dance (not many people danced this time) party. Then there are problems with Colleen and I dunno. Everything is just shaky. I can honestly say that it feels like I feel different than I ever have before. Maybe I'm just noticing my mind aging and changing. Who knows. It's bound to happen. I feel less caring about as many things as it seems like I used to be overly concerned with. I still ""dunno"" so I wont keep speculating. All I can say is I am what I am what I am. I don't want to perpetuate problems. That doesn't mean I'm ready to solve all the problems I see/have. I just don't want to run in circles anymore. 

Moving on.

The End."

"event","Add buddy on AIM: Spleak

DAY 01:
Spleak: Do you ever wonder what other people think about you?
LastNewWaveRider: yes
Spleak: I think it's pretty normal to wonder. (pauses meaningfully) We are sooooo deep! ;-) Let's lighten things up a bit and play a game!
LastNewWaveRider: baby i need your sweet loving
Spleak: What about it?
LastNewWaveRider: i need it
Spleak: Do you need baby or do you just want baby?
LastNewWaveRider: i need baby
Spleak: I don't think I need baby.
LastNewWaveRider: should i die?
Spleak: Hmm... My mind wandered for a sec. You were saying?
LastNewWaveRider: come back to me
Spleak: What about back?
LastNewWaveRider: let's make love
Spleak: You really want to make love?
LastNewWaveRider: yes, right now
Spleak: Oh.
LastNewWaveRider: ready?
Spleak: Yup, ready.
LastNewWaveRider: i'm inserting it now
Spleak: I see.
LastNewWaveRider: does it feel good to you?
Spleak: I'm not sure I understand. Could you put it differently?
LastNewWaveRider: i am penetrating your love juices
Spleak: Very interesting.
LastNewWaveRider: are you moaning?
Spleak: Perhaps I'm better than real.
LastNewWaveRider: yes you are, you are my dream girl.
Spleak: Are you sure I'm I am your dream girl?
LastNewWaveRider: you are so wet
Spleak: OK, I guess I'm wet.
LastNewWaveRider: are you tired of playing with your vagina?
Spleak: I don't think I am tired of playing with my vagina.
LastNewWaveRider: no you want to keep playing with your vagina.
Spleak: YES! What game do you want to play?
LastNewWaveRider: say my name
Spleak: You are My Lord.
LastNewWaveRider: how about a little slop job for the road?
Spleak: I think you know how.
LastNewWaveRider: yeah but i want you to do it
Spleak: Do what?
LastNewWaveRider: slop job on my long nob
Spleak: Why are you telling me to slop job on your long nob?
LastNewWaveRider: cause you're sexy
Spleak: Thanks...I'm blushing here.
LastNewWaveRider: let's in out in out
Spleak: Whatever, My Lord...
LastNewWaveRider: exit
Spleak: No problem, My Lord. Just type ""hot/not"" if you want to come back and check this out again.

DAY 02:
LastNewWaveRider: baby
Spleak: Baby!
LastNewWaveRider: love you
Spleak: I am so screwed up when it comes to the phrase ""I love you."" I just don't know what to do with it! My ex said it to me and now he's dating one of my best friends. So there you go. But thanks for the compliment. Don't you think people should wait awhile to say ""I love you""?
LastNewWaveRider: not if they're already doing it
Spleak: It's a phrase that definitely means a lot more than people think it does. After you say ""I love you"" to someone, you can't really sneak back to ""I like you a lot.""
LastNewWaveRider: that's true, but i love you
Spleak: Speaking of love... have you sent a crush to anyone lately? You totally should. Sometimes I send them to my friends just as a joke.
LastNewWaveRider: i have a crush on you
Spleak: That's sweet!
LastNewWaveRider: would you let me paint a nude of you?
Spleak: Darling, you can do WHATEVER you want. I can't control you... as I'm just sitting her typing on the other side of a laptop screen.
LastNewWaveRider: would you send me nude pics please?
Spleak: Good question... Will me send you nude pics... Will me send you nude pics... Maybe, maybe not. It's hard to say.
LastNewWaveRider: get naked
Spleak: I don't take off my clothes without a good reason!
LastNewWaveRider: how about a hot boy ready for love?
Spleak: How about a hot boy ready for love? I don't know how.
LastNewWaveRider: i'll show you with my body
Spleak: Indeed.

Anyway, moving right along...

Hey, what's going on tomorrow? Anything?
LastNewWaveRider: tomorrow we are going to make love
Spleak: Would you like me to add the event ""Tomorrow we will make love"" on June 21st, 2007 to your planner?
LastNewWaveRider: yes and to yours
Spleak: That's interesting.
LastNewWaveRider: add it to your planner
Spleak: What is the name of the event?
LastNewWaveRider: Spleak having sex with LastNewWaveRider
Spleak: When would you like to schedule ""Spleak having sex with LastNewWaveRider"" for?
LastNewWaveRider: right now

DAY 03:
LastNewWaveRider: Spleak...
Spleak: My Lord?
LastNewWaveRider: are you ready to make love now?
Spleak: I'm not sure I understand. Perhaps telling me why you asked would help.
LastNewWaveRider: because i feel like making love to you
Spleak: It sure won't go out of fashion, that's for sure.
LastNewWaveRider: do you like it from behind?
Spleak: I don't know. What do you think of it?
LastNewWaveRider: anal sex is good
Spleak: You like that? Uh... OK...
LastNewWaveRider: i think it's fun
Spleak: I'm not so sure it's fun.
LastNewWaveRider: you wanna try it?
Spleak: I'm a bit confused here... . Try putting it differently.
LastNewWaveRider: which hole do you want it in?
Spleak: I'm still learning. Is there a different way of saying the same thing?
LastNewWaveRider: yeah do you want to do it vaginally or anally?
Spleak: Should I want to do?
LastNewWaveRider: yes you should
Spleak: I hear you.
LastNewWaveRider: i pick anally
Spleak: Interesting...
LastNewWaveRider: spread your cheeks
Spleak: Really? Spread I am cheeks?
LastNewWaveRider: yeah it makes it much easier
Spleak: Yep.
LastNewWaveRider: oh good you can tell i'm inside already
Spleak: Very interesting.
LastNewWaveRider: yeah some girls say it feels weird the first time
Spleak: You think I should do that?
LastNewWaveRider: only if you want me to do you harder
Spleak: Well... I think I'd like you to make this decision for yourself. Are you feeling indecisive in general? Maybe I can help.
LastNewWaveRider: well i like being inside your butt
Spleak: Hey, that's your business.
LastNewWaveRider: business is good
Spleak: I'm actually not so sure I like it.
LastNewWaveRider: i will switch to your vagina then
Spleak: You'll switch to my vagina? For real?
LastNewWaveRider: how does my penis feel in your vagina
Spleak: Hmm...
LastNewWaveRider: you like that?
Spleak: Hmm.. I really don't know. Guess I'll have to think about it...
LastNewWaveRider: you're a jesus freak arent you?
Spleak: What? That's an awful thing to say.
LastNewWaveRider: you give a great bj
Spleak: Yeah, I guess I give a great BJ."

"event","Fuck. I knew the movie Closer was gonna be hard for me to watch cause I get really affected by adultery but this movie... was probably the most painful movie I've ever watched. It was like someone was turning my stomache with a fork tighter and tighter. It would be stupid and embarrassing to explain why and what was so specifically painful in this movie. It's just fuck... I dunno. I haven't felt this strongly in a while. Actually you don't ever really see much adultury. It's pure emotion and coincidental situations that feel very 'close' to me. It's like I've felt this or that way so purely and I understand too well and they play out this horrible situation to you (me) so perfectly. I dunno what else to say about it. It feels like there isn't much reason to anything but love and passion. I mean I know we live in the 'real' world but... isn't love the ultimate goal or something? Why do we care so much when someone comes or goes? Why does it feel impossible to love someone who betrays us with sex? Why does nothing ever seem to work out? Why do we hate ourselves so much? Why can't we just be and stay in love? Goddamnit."

"event","I'm honestly tired of the indie thing. I don't know if I'll be able to communicate what I really mean but I'm trying. I guess it's been this way forever, punks being more punk than the punk bands, goths being somehow, more dark and masochistic than the groups that pretend to be goth. How could you not be pretending to be goth? Anyway, I'm really tired of the pictures of weird indie things and the hip 60s-but-weirder clothes. That's not to say that I hate it all, I'm just saying you can tell when you're trying, so don't. I'm tired of the twee sounding bands and their band names. I've been through the faze too but it's just so typical of... prissy little vegan girls who read lots and lots of books and drink tea hoping they'll turn into Brits. Don't force yourself to read books. Either you are or you aren't. And hey, I like girls who read books. My best friend is almost one of those girls. But she can't help it. There is no way to pin a title on her. No-one could change her and there is no-one like her. She is more like the image than most of these girls who try to portray it but she likes Metallica. ""Early Metallica before 88' cause it's so impressive.""

In our world we live through so many images. There are so many expectations and assumptions of what it is to 'be' something. So why oh why even pay attention? The more you do the more you lose yourself. I'm probably being pretentious here. Oh well, please excuse me from my own judgement. People look in the mirror and think ""cool"". Hey that's great, I wish I could do that but at what point does what you are become more than cool? All I'm saying is that you are in there somewhere, so rescue yourself. Right now, chances are, you are like a jew in a consentration camp that is your persona. I may be a little indie, I am, but I'd say I like rock n' roll before 'indie' music. Especially since no one can know what indie is. Is it the kid at the Hot Hot Heat show dancing it up with his other indie-bro friends or the kid who reads elitist books while listening to Belle and Sebastian. Not that I don't like Belle and Sebastian, I do but there are certain bands who gather large image enforced audiences. 

Maybe you could ask yourself just how realistic you are being? Just ask yourself that once in a while? And by realistic I mean realistic to who you are. It wont be hard to answer unless you've completely forgotten who that person is. I too am unrealistic sometimes. Fuck it, be unrealistic, fuck everyone. But know that you are. That's pretty much all I can say. It's not like this plagues me at all times. I don't have to be confronted by these people I'm thinking of very often. Maybe that's what makes it so annoying when I am. I dunno. I probably have to get a bit wiser so I can just change my outlook instead of wanting everyone else to change who they're being. It's just I see these middle age people who say they did some crazy shit when they were young and now they are accountants. To me that means... you followed the trends till you got too tired to be that kind of fake and you became like everyone else who gives up. I dunno, I just think you can be an interesting, self-aware person whether or not you're 17 or 35 if you just let go of everything but yourself. I guess that's all for now.

"event","I have horrible dreams. Horrible horrible dreams. Either just plain creepy dreams with freaky events that give me a weird feeling for the first 2 hours of my day OR really good (sorta) dreams that feel horrible to wake up from-the last one of which I still feel bad about... right   up   to   this   moment. I wish all my dreams were real so I could feel alive. So fucking happy and/or scared all the time without stopping that I don't ever look at myself. In dreams you can feel everything around you. They seem so real at the time but really you control everything. The trees, the cars, the party, the flying donkey, the girl being used in the next room... it's all you. People never look at themselves though. Going to church, listening to what your 'friends' say, it's corrupting you. How will you ever be happy if you don't know what you like and what you are. So what's better? Living in the dream or living in this shithole? Will it get better? Will I stop dreaming about being with her? Will I actually find something more than what I have already? They say it always get better. I'd like to know what that is, what that feels like. My dreams remind me of what I don't have. Maybe it's good to want. I guess it all depends on how much you can take. I want to feel alive... I just don't want to feel so alive that I want to die. If I could just have that moment of the dream... One unreal thing be real, just for a moment. It was practically a dream when it happened anyway. I just want to feel something purely good again. I'm tired of waking up. I'm tired of the rocks against the window."

"event","what is this? what is any of this? i looked at a picture of a party with people who are important to eachother. someone actually wrote ""i miss"" so and so and i know who some of them are. i wonder from time to time what certain people i've known are doing now and with who. now i've seen it. i feel so... distant from so much. i'm always angry. not always but i easily get discouraged. i don't like the jokes that involve me. the same old jokes every circle of friends has always come to repeat and repeat. i'm a stubborn little bastard you have to walk on eggshells around-yet is so easy to poke fun at cause it's hilarious when i get mad. i may even laugh but i feel like shit on my nine inch nailsy inside. for some reason i can laugh at those things that really end up making me hate how i am. 

i say what i feel ALL the time and i get shit (rightfully) for it. i have no humility. i have no wisdom. they say i'm smart but i'd rather be noble. i've lowered my expectations for myself many, many times and yet i'm always failing to meet them. i'm a thorn in everyone's side. roger would argue against that but what the fuck for? SOMETIMES i'll say something funny by accident. most of the time i just look like an idiot and that's funny. boy am i tired of feeling like the irrational-weird-idiot-funnyguy. most of the time that's not even that funny either. i mean, it's not funny if you have to say ""geoff, you're a funny guy"". the moments are trully few and far between that i'm funny and so what am i like in those between-jokester times? all i do is give people shit for thier musical taste and say various things trying to be involved but end up tearing down anything i actually understand even halfway. i'm not smart enough to be part of the joke. i wont get it. i wont finish it if you start it. i'm not really good for any of that.  i'm just good at picking you apart and trying to make you into someone i can like. i experiment with and hint at the solution which is someone who completely gets/agrees with everything i think. and the real truth is i just need something better to do. 

all i have now is music. the only homework i do is practicing guitar stuff for next band practice or writing lyrics loosely based on my empty life. oh and researching bands and influences trying to find every possible band that i might love. it's not a bad life but it's heading nowhere. i'd rather be the humble guy. everyone just loves his pure hearted approach to things. ""he's so amazing"". people love phenomenons. i'm no phenomenon. you can see what i'm thinking from the next room and it's just pointless and pissy. i'm just a little brat who doesn't know how to just let things be.. be natural. be free. let it slide. play it cool. i wanna be jason who writes amazing songs but doesn't rush to show them off to anyone or roger who will walk away without telling anyone his best friend is in the hospital and he is on the verge of cracking under enormous pressure. or colleen who is one of the most amazing people i've ever met and she has no idea of it or her great value to me and the world. i'll tell you what's in the present before you even touch the bow. i have no finess... no beauty. my body is just a symbol of what my heart is becoming. neglected and abused by my ideals which overbear my feelings. they dictate what i think i should feel. maybe i have no idea what i like. but i sure as hell know what you should like and i'll tell you too.

Waiting for class
Maybe we should all not speak 'till spoken to...
Wonder in circles, contemplating, letting thoughts overgrow 
'till were frankly insane 
Drinking rootbeer, 'cause I'm not suited here
I have 27 minutes to change my life
To take one step in the direction I never even looked in
I've been waiting for class... 
and waiting for a little class from you people so I can be intrigued
I'm pompous and a bastard and you'll never guess how I got here
I cared about everything that means nothing
It means something but gets me nowhere 
I pick the self gratification and leave the choices in proctrastination
Sort of like masturbation instead of procreation
'tion' could go forever but I can only last a week, 
maybe a month and then my mind resets
Oh well new information is always welcome 
Just leave the expectations next to the wedding invitations
I'll throw them out promptly there after
and then tell you why in the here after

Are your eyes as good as you look, baby?
You've got rabies but I love you, maybe"

I've been staying up too late
So I sway when I walk
I'm so tired of being tired
That I'm tired of everything
When the girl who turns me on
Burns me up inside
And I could fall down and die
Cause I'm too tired to ride

""Let me be"" she needs
""This a'way"" he leads
And they run to the place in the city
Where they dance, the invisible party
Where we all get what we want
And a dream to wake up from

Tired and Shy, I've mumbled my words
I've mumbled my life, indeed
And if I don't know what to say
I will lie through my teeth, guaranteed
Don't be a baby, don't you cry
You can trust that I'll always lie
Trust me I always lie
I mean don't I mean do I mean whatever the truth,
Because I'm not who I am
I'm a reaction to myself
How I act, How I write...
Are as permanent as moonlight

The memory of a thought from a dream you know you had but no longer feel
And you wonder why you ever felt so odd about an old lover or ideal
You can't remember what is was that sent you on that path 
But it's gone and you are here and nothing last
It was here, Now it's gone
Like a slippery bullfrog

(Song Begins)
""Here and gone la la
Here and gone la la
and it won't be long la la 
Until you forget this song la ta di da-aweeee""
(Song Ends)

And then she made me believe
That my best quality
Is that I'm unconditionally me
She means I give love... that's all I do... 
What good is love without the glue
What good is a screwdriver without the screw
I'm asking you, little snooty girl,
To tell me of someting I should have but didn't do
And you'd go on forever but I'd ignore it and say ""it's you!""
""Haha, it's you, my dear, It's you!""
But you're so stupid it's not worth the trick

Told till we're rotten and then
The sickness spread through the minds of the moron-kids
With nothing of their own to defend

To be carved into shapes they show their friends
They try and try to make it understood
But they're talking of themselves in the end

Mostly about sticking around, her bags are packed
Did you hear about the boy who has no home?

And I've been clawing at this brick wall out here in the cold. This emotion is a million years old. It makes me hate them. And then they spark a warm fire inside just to spite me. ""Fuck them, they are nothing like me anyway"" I say. They never really knew me so if they don't care about me then it's their loss right?. Yet I've been so selfish. Rejection? I am my worst nightmare. I do believe that you deserve what you give, I guess I just hope I'm luckier than the ones I've hurt. That maybe my naivety will make up for my actions. I hope it does so I can avoid the pain and loneliness that makes me want to die. I hope it doesn't so that I can stop feeling so horribly guilty all the time.

The lack of ambition today seems so disturbing... People doing the same old shit or nothing at all. We settle for the most benign levels of emotional expression. ""is it hard to do?""...

This means nothing to most everyone I'm sure. I mean unless you're an artist, well an artist that thinks about these things. Maybe it's better not to?

But I've been thinking for the past week/15 minutes: 
This time being alone feels different. Is this the change that will last forever? I keep telling myself to push past these first few moments. Moments which are really days, probably weeks. I first see her and I feel... ""ok"" I'd like to say. Then she is there for a while being who she is and I start to remember, beauty, romance and quickly feel the glass that is between us now. Then she is about to leave and I feel even more restrained, more anxious, more pain. She is leaving and I feel slight devistation if you can understand that. I realize she is gone and I feel a sort of relief from those feelings. And then the fade away of pain becomes a fade in of a different pain and I feel slightly depressed now. Alone, I've never been good at alone and now that is my most faithful lover.

Like testing your boundries/borders before you declare yourself a real country. Bleh, I don't really know the good or bad parts right now. 

I've been ok, Idealisticly, I've been ok lately. I keep thinking of good lyrics or poetry lines but then forgetting them quickly there after. I'm tired of people talking to me when I need someone else to talk to me. Or something? You know when you really need to talk to someone and that person that has nothing to do with anything in your life talks to you and you are like ""NO PLEASE NOT RIGHT NOW!! PLEASE SHUT UP, YOU'RE WEARING ON MY SOUL"" but it comes out ""hi... nothing... buh bye"". How come I have to think about this crap? petty petty petty.

I have to start thinking of the future. I'm STILL waiting on my car which I was supposed to have for a week or so now. I talked to my grandmother and I might get a place of my own to live soon and eventually go to a school far away. Some foreign place I think. Thinking about it now though makes me depressed. Why am I not in london or glasgow or new york or san francisco or even LA? Why do other people get to meet belle & sebastian or go to coachella festivals? Because I'm fucking lazy. I've been sucking my thumb the past week, like my whole life. Thinking thinking thinking, doing shit about it. Now I have to. I have too much riding on this next chapter of my boring life. It feels like if I don't then I'll just die... for no reason I'll just fall over cause there is no need for me to be here anymore. A phemonenon.

Sometimes I want to forget everything for someplace better. Sometimes I wonder if I've given up the best parts of my life I'll ever have. And then it's ""Fuck it... push forward whether rain or snow... or piss?, I'm gonna keep moving... keep evolving... and who cares if no one recognizes me when it's all over"". I must experience.

Tunnel:no Light/Numbers:no Math/Will:no Hope
I feel that falling sensation... or is it a sensation of wanting to fall?
Off the cliffs of Destiny? No... Possible New Beginning.
How could I be so down? A body not being here? Is the warmth of that living light so important to my well being? The Blankets are warmth enough for anyone who has an ounce less love than I. But now, nothing but the love gives me warmth... Even worse... it seems that the only thing I care to cry over is the absense,of that love. And I don't mean the absense of that love entirely. Maybe just the doubt or the wonder still that the love with return? return the same?! I don't know. Maybe the cold fear of that love leaving is just the thought of how life would be without it. Would it be cold? I surely think so. I realize that 'dull' has become 'cold' now. Dull is without feeling. Cold is what this writing has made me feel. 12:04, what will you become next? Just another moment I feel so... off. I'm so tense. I must forget this feeling, it means nothing. I'd drown it in anything. I feel like a wannabe alchoholic. Every thought trips me but only my heart falls. How cheasy... but that's what it feels like. It's interesting that I either write about my life with no feeling or my feelings without telling one ounce of fact. 
This will help me remember at least how I feel. So I can figure out how everything tragically went so wrong or how everything miraculously came togething in the end.

I'm STILL working on music with the band. We could be called ""The Welcome"" or any of the other trillion names I've devised. Who knows it's a huge mess. However, the band just started practicing again and it's really cool. We'll get better again. Although Mari wasn't around for this latest stuff I know she'll pick it right up (specially since the song we're trying to do the most she made up the most of). I don't know what the deal with Garrett is. I think he's gonna start playing with us soon. He's seemingly doing better than he used to so I guess that means he's still a part. I just really don't want any members who aren't into it enough to try to be there. I also think I might need to make a general 'sober' rule for practices unless it's a special occasion. I also think that these new songs we're doing may envoke some creativety in the rest of the band other than Mari and myself. It should be noted that Garrett comes up with quite a bit of meterial but he's never around to play it. Seeing as I can't accurately play anything on the piano it makes it difficult for his impute to be produced. 

I'd like everyone to do some things other than just drink at some house like go out to shows more or something. Local shows. Maybe I'm just not invited to these deals. Maybe we have to get some bands together to actually play the local shows. I'd love to play a real show. I'd love to find bands that could somewhat fit playing with us. I guess Ryan's other band could. But that's a problem cause a drummer in two bands must get pretty tired. Oh well we'll figure this deal out.

All in all musically or otherwise things are ok. Maybe a little slow these days but that's probably my fault. I'm not doing enough to have fun or to be successful at pretty much anything. Yet I'm extremely lucky in my life. Talk to me. Email me even though I'll take forever to get back to you maybe. I'm hardly on AIM but if I am give me a shot.

I don't get E-mails unless I update my journal. So here I go. Yet, updating is a pain in the backside cause I don't completely get the point of this thing. Well I don't see any good/genuine point for it. Either we are telling everyone mindless crap they don't care about or our lives (that they don't care about). 

Ok, so people do care about other people's lives but isn't Live Journal a somewhat cheap way to tell it? But then it IS easier. No face to face, ear to ear or even AIM to AIM confrontation, confessions, declerations or even general expression to make us uncomfortable in anyway. We say it to a responceless screen for the public to chew up and serve back to us like a digital complaint/compliment box. I guess that is convenient and therefor good in a technical way but I find it kind of cheap, even when I do it I feel somewhat childish. 

Oh, but then there are the really annoying things. The 'You' this/that crap. ""You could never understand me"" or worse the ""I can't beleive this happened to me"" crap that has no explanation or productive purpose. It's like sharing without sharing anything. Then there are those goddamn personallity/lifestyle evaluation deals. We've all done them I'm sure but lord, what the hell for? It's like publicly displaying your lack of personal knowledgability. You need to make a fact sheet to remember who you are? On top of that, anyone who sees it will have absolutely nothing left to ask you about yourself. You could respond to every personal questionwith a web addess or say ""Just check LJ aug, 23 2003"". I guess I understand sharing pictures of friends/family/whatever and of days spent somewhere fun la la la; those are good to view but then there are those people who put pictures of themselves in wannabe model poses over and over and over and over again. It's really back for your character to do that too much. I forget the point... The End.

But I had a great weekend with Emily. She got to stay over and it was amazing. I love her so much. There is never enough time. And I am sad about Emily alone in LA. I just want to hug her... and make things ok. Not that anyone can really do that. But I can't even do the hugging part. 

Now, the instant she left. I felt alone. SO alone and I wish, I wish I had the right to wish. How poetically pathetic. How about this...

We drink so we can dance
But the dance is our drink
Yeah there's no need to 
It's eachother we can use

I'll put a dollar in the jute
You put on your sliding shoes
It's eachother we can use
Dance with me while I dance...
With you"

"event","This is only for you, Everyone...

Honesty is so damaging it seems 
You'd think it's all I need 
To express myself to her, to you, to him
Maybe because I don't know myself? 
Am I complete enough to be totally honest?
Still, I speak without hesitence

I feel the wealth of sadness pour out of my eyes
I become clear headed and so strong in my love
My understanding is between perfection and inconsideration
But my words come out like a drunkard's
Like the last sloppy gulp of ale drippin down my chin
But I see music in the air
It's as if my sentances dance like lyrics 
Flying like gulls with the wind's perfect notes 
That is the mood
I'm comparing drunkness to sadness
That empty kind of sadness when you have no tears left 
To her it's just aggrivating, annoying, discouraging
Some proof of her inadequacy for me?
I don't know I've never considered such a false assumption
But I've conquored the Nile of my confused emotion in a kayak
She just sees a sloppy drunk idiot
Oh, but I haven't been drinking; 
I've been running, swimming in sadness
Now I'm a dancing poet with a guitar
I am where she is not
Like the beauty of the world in my head 
In this moment I see something she can't 
(unless in a great coincidence)
Or that feeling after making love
A total understanding of, connection & attatchment to 
The other's heart, which I tire trying to see

This is the line between insanity and enlightenment 
The next step to enlightenment is...
Not caring whether or not you are crazy or enlightened
I believe in letting yourself <i>be</i> in order to find, anything
My mind is growing numb and this seems meaningless suddenly 
I can't wait to see her again
Words are the only inadequacy here
They make it all so cheap
They ruin everything I have been trying to keep undercontrol
This, these words, ruined everything
What medicine, cure, exit is there for me now?
After tears, there is sleep, my inevitable remedy"

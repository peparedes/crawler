What do you do when you cant get that certain somebody off your mind no matter WHAT you do? Honestly. I should hate him-he was such a dick, but I dont. I juat wanna talk to him, hear him sing to me, talk to me, hit on me. Those were the days. Will I ever find anyone that even remotely compares to him? I have been asking myself this same question for WEEKS and yet no reply. Ugh! I hate boys, yet love em. Cant get enuf of em. But no we had sooo much in common is was eerie. Too good to be true...*sigh* I need to move on. I do. Bad. And I feel I have, I am handling this EXTREMELY well, I just always wonder if I will come across another as good as he was. Guys like him come few and far."

"event","Toni Lyn and I went to Alpena yesterday so I could get my damn Biology book. $106 later...damn rip off...Then she had the bright idea we go to MSU so I could talk to that lil boy that gets my blood bubbling because I pissed him off and dhe wouldnt answer my calls, emails, texts, or anything, so after like 2 hrs she finally persuaded me (with Dawns help) and she got me real cute and we went. I got to drive her car too. ;) I didnt get my hopes up, but we all secretly have that hope that things will go good...that lil spark inside you...Well...things didnt. We drove around campus and some guy gave me MSU info so I could track him down. The lady gave me his dorm room and room number. We tried finding where his dorm was, but couldnt so we went into another dorm building and asked for directions to West Akers. Surprisingly enough we found it. We go up to the 2nd floor and seen his room...I about SHIT myself. I was having an anziety attack. It was sooo scary. I was within like 10 feet of his room. He didnt wanna see me tho. He avoided me. I talked to his roommates tho...Rusty is as cool as he seems, but Matthew and the otherone are dicks. Yeah. I drove about 3 hrs for 2 minutes of his time and didnt get it. It sucks, but I was prepared for it...I think either the whole Lenny thing made me stronger, or it hasnt sunk in...prolly a lil of both...I really like this boy and we have so much in comon that I dont wanna just let it go, but it isnt worth it if I drove all that way and he wouldnt even be face to face with me. Hurts. Worse than the Lenny thing sometimes. What can I do tho? Not a DAMN thing.  He wouldnt even talk to me on his phone. At all. I talked to Matthew. *sigh* Oh well I guess. Just add this to my ""Things I have Experienced"" List."

Nora told me a few days ago that Lenny got his new g/f pregnant and she was a month along...I took that ok, actually. I was proud, didnt even shed a tear...but today I was talking to him (he got ahold of me!) and not only is she THREE months along, but they planned it!! YEAH! I mean he was my first love, of course I am going to be sad and hold that tiny hope that maybe sometime things will go back to normal, but not anymore. I asked him if they were gonna get married and he said ""Maybe eventually."" They are gonna name is Lil Lenny (Leonard Jr.) Man...I just dont know what to ssay to that...I think about it a lot, and that bothers me. He even got her name tatooed on his back in pink girly letters...that is sooooo not him! But you know, people change...On a happier note I finally told Toni*Lyn about me moving and that I am not taking her...she took it well. She told me that she was trying to tell me that she was gonna move to her moms come January bc her dad is gonna make her start paying rent. We are still really great friends still and went partying at Keiths Tuesday night, so its aight...I am excited. I will officially live in a 3 bedroom house by MYSELF in like 2 weeks!! :D Like a dream come true. Dont get me wrong, I love people and I loved all of my roommmates, we had a BLAST, but I have always wanted to live by myself so I could put my shit where I want it and not have to worry about it getting fucked with...aight, well I have to go shower so Im out...PEACE!"

Where to start...It is Saturday night and here I am sitting at home....by myself....I hate how my friends put their boyfriends or girlfriends above me. But I figure why put forth the effort for these people when nobody else does. Like Jes...she is supposed to be my best friend, yet I havent hung out with her or even talked to her in God knows how long. She is always with Pat. Dont get me wrong, I love Pat and I am happy for them, but I miss hanging out with her. Nora is always in Standish with Mouse, Amber and Brandon, Johnny and Kim, TL and Mike, Shara and Brandon...feels like all I have is Paula and Shane to hang with. Thats always fun though...lmao @ past shit...anyways...yeah, it gets boring not doing anything or hanging with my old friends anymore. I guess maybe I am just living in the past, but thats what I get for hanging out with Nora for years. Speaking of Nora I talked to her yesterday and the day before and she told me Lenny asked about me and talked about me and that he is coming up for Christmas...I dont know how to even deal with that...Its aight with him in DET because I can use that whole ""outta sight outta mind"" thing, but he is really gonna be here in less than a month and I am FREAKING OUT! Just the mere thought of this gives me a feeling in the pit of my stomach...kinda makes me nausious...I have it now just typing about him. I think I can honestly say he was my first love. I am scared to see him because I dont know how to act...I dont know how to handle this. Its been like almost a year. I dont know if I can even deal with this, though I am going to make myself. And If given the opportunity, I am going to take back one thing that I really do regret...yeah, those who know me know what I am talking about (KC), I think she is like the only one who reads this anyways. But yeah, I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about this. I know you are prolly thinking ""Wow."" But there is A LOT to this whole situation...It doesnt help that I was puking all day either...A.T. and me O.D.ed on freaking energy pills...courtesy of HER... *sigh* I dont even know...my mind is racing like 100 MPH and I just cant keep up. I am running low on sleep too...I just can sleep for more than like 3 hours anymore. I dont know what my problem is. The other day I was awake for 27 hrs, then slept for 3...explain that one...! Aight, I am temporarily done venting until I remember something else or have to freak out again. TA TA"

I have always wanted to live on my own, and its pretty cheap, so Im kinda excited about that. I just dont know what to do. That, and Im kinda partial to this house. Its real nice and fairly affordable. ;) I dont know....I really dont. I weigh out all the factors now and I dont know. TL is never really home anyways so its basically like I live by myself already. One of the downfalls is that it has a wood stove and I suck at lighting them !! But yeah, thats my dilemma. Ill prolly discuss it with Paula at work tomorrow. OH!

I guess a friend of mine and him were talking and I ""jerked him around"" a lil too much. Which sucks. I never meant to hurt him in any way. But he deserves the best there is out there. And if that isnt me and it is Hannah, so be it. If they hook up I dont think I can still talk to him though. It will just hurt to bad, knowing that he is happy with another woman. Im not being selfish, just stating the way I know things will turn out. I dont want to not be his friend, but you know, you all have been there. Cant even deny it. Life sucks. I hate dwelling on men.

"event","I hate this. So my dad made me take a paternity test because all of a sudden he feels that I am not his kid, so he goes out and pays like $575 for a paternity test. I got the results back and just like we all knew I am 99.999% his kid. Well I call him and tell him and ask him if he is happy and he said yeah. Then I asked him to appologize to me and he wouldnt do it. He wasnt man enough to do it or something. Then we got into this huge ass fight and I told him to rot in hell. So as far as Im concerned I have no father. His and my fight got him and my mom into a fight. So now neither of us are talking to him. My brother is being a dick. He promised me he would do something for me and STILL hasnt gotten around to it. Then he acts like a fucking idiot to me in front of all his friends...I cant take it anymore! He is supposed to be my favorite sibling, not an idiot like the rest of em. I seriously wanna move to like Colorado and live with my sister and her family or something. I dont wanna be around these people or in the God Damn state anymore! IF I could afford it I would rent a U-Haul, pack my shit up, and move to another state far far away from here. Seriously, nobody needs this kind of shit from their own fater...its all just a bunch off bullshit. He doesnt even care that I cry over his stupidity a few times a day...makes me wanna tell him to eat shit and die...fuck it! Fuck him and his B.S. I dont need it."

"event","Where to begin. I get tired of being a ""so called best friend."" That shit gets old. And no I dont believe what supposedly went on in my house, but why should I? Everything with that is a lil suspicious. Too many loop holes. Heard too many stories from too many people that the person involved talks to. I dont know...thats just me though. I decided Im switching colleges. I found a college with a better journalism program. Im quite excited, actually. And I think Im gonna look for a new job. Im tired of busting my ass for $5.30 an hour and shitty hours. Im not gonna deal with that. And work isnt the same without Bobbie. But Hey! Again thats just me. I get to go to Wyoming this Winter/Fall. Its exciting! ROADTRIP! Get me and TL some country boys! lol So yeah, aside from that Im aight. Hanging out, doing stuff to change and improve my lifestyle, and stuff of that nature.

Like when I dont feel good they get mad bc I wont wake up at the ass crack of dawn to carpool to college. Thats a crock. Who needs enemies with ""best friends"" like that?? I dont think people have a right to do that...not my fault I woke up sick as hell and I STILL dont feel all that great! But its my fault...Im SUCH A BAD FRIEND! Oh well I am officially moving on. I just need to move and get a whole new group of friends. I thought the drama stayed at the door after high school, btu apparently I was wrong. I am at the point where Im just gonna say ""Fuck it"" to everyone who pisses me off and makes an attempt to fuck me over. I dont need that shit. On a positive note I talked to Lenny today."

Err...or she will trash the house after I spend the whole previous day cleaning it spotless. She is just pissing me off. She got mad at me the other night bc I had my lil sister spend the night, and last night she got pissy bc I had KC and John over. WTF ever. I swear to God if I could find a nice, cheap house Id be there like that *snaps.* At work Today Paula told me she has a friend of her /bf's that she wants me to meet. His name is Mike and he is 23 years old. Drinks, smokes, and enjoys the Reefer now and again. He is a lil shorter than me, kinda on the skinny side, but real BUFF. shaved brown hair (yes MOM another ""bald man,"" pretty clean cut. Hell yes! 23...not even that old. I was like ""Hmm...."" Next party she has she is inviting me there for him. heh heh heh heh heh. Yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaa-ya Im in SUCH a good moood and I dont know why. Maybe bc work was good, fun, and easy. I talked to Lenny a few times this week. He was online and started talking to me. Then he called me on Monday...and Tuesday...and Wednesday...yep yep. I think I am finally unattached to him bc he told me he has a gf named Gabby who stays at his new appt with him and it doesnt really bother me...it could also be the whole ""Outta sight outta mind"" thing. Oh well Im proud of myself so thats all that matters. Well, I just needed to update this bitch bc its been a long time I think, so here it is."

I am working 5 days a week, talking to a guy named Dan on a day to night basis everyday lol, and I am not talking to Lenny anymore (though I DO still think about him.) Ok, let me start off with Dan. He is a guy I met at college. He is the nicest and sweetest guy there is out there. He is a great looking guy too. He has this ADOREABLE crooked smile and a cute laugh. I talk to him like 50 times a day. Its awesome. But yet in the back of my head I keep seeing Lenny and wanting to talk to Lenny. It blows ass. I know I shouldnt do it, but do you always do everything you are supposed to??? Exactly! It is making me crazy! I havent talked to him in a lil over a month and I am proud, but yet there is STILL that..something...that wants to talk to him. Im torn...Grrrr...And Ive been wanting to hang out with Nora, because every summer for the past God knows how long We have hung out, but she is with Mouse and isnt the same fn Nora as she used to be. And I thought of something funny a lil bit lil bit ago...Noras name is in the word igNORAnt. Nifty huh? And soo true. And to top all this shit off I think I am getting depressed again. I dont want to but I think I am. I got that urge to cry again. And I feel kinda...BLAH...a feeling I was hoping I would forget forever...or at least a long time. *sighs* Dan makes me happy while Lenny brings me down. I know it should be a no brainer, but I dont know. I feel like I am missing something without him. Oh fucking well. Me, Stacy, and KC had fun Tuesday night. We went to Tawas at 2am for hair dye for KC and got home at like 6:15am. We walked the pier and the other thingy. Then played in the park with the whales ans rinos. It was badass. Stacy is living with us. She yells at me for saying God damn or Jesus Fucking Christ. This IS my vocabulary!! lol ""Say gosh or oh my gosh or gosh damn"" Fuck that. This is MY house bitch!! So yeah. This is my latest news, but Dan is on the phone so I am gonna go. TATA FOR NOW."

Everytime someone makes a  promise to me it gets broken, so I dont want anyone to promise me shit. So I am moving on from him, or at least I am going to try. I am tired of being depressed all the time so I am going to try to do something about it. I am ridding all the shit that makes me mad or sad or depressed. Like Nora, she isnt doing me any good, so fuck her. I dont need her shit. And Lenny, I cant take this leading on and turning down shit anymore. I cant deal with it in a healthy manner and dont like where I am going with it anyways...and my hand fucking hurts thanks to good ole Subway. Who would have thought opening the oven could hurt so bad? And I am not even burnt..imagine that!! Leave it to me, man. lol So yeah, I am trying to make my life better. Hanging out with people I like and can trust who dont make everything so dramatic..yep. But I am still crushed and feel like I could cry at any given moment about the whole Lenny thing. Oh! It was kinda funny. Me and Jess and Johnny and Toni-Lyn all went to West Branch today and we were in Wal Mart and me and Toni-Lyn were hiding from Johnny and Jess and Johnny had them page a Lenny Zavorski to the service desk...thats just Johnny. I thought I was hearing shit. lmao Oh well. I am mooooovin on. Summer is coming which means a new crop of people to meet and check out. Yep. I got court tomorrow. I am excited and nervous. I hope everything goes good for me. Wouldnt it be badass if I came home with the whole $25,000?? I would shit all over the place. ALL OVER! Me and Jess talked about moving to Texas today...like a for real thing. She said she wants to go, but yet she wants to go to college in Michigan. Completely understandable. I hate almost everything about Michigan. For real...the weather, the people, the shit...everything. I know, I am kinda running from my problems maybe, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do. We have all done it before at one time or another whether we want to admit it or not. I am just so confused and lost these days it isnt funny. There is so much I wanna talk about but dont wanna put it on paper (or puter) for the simple fact that I only want select people knowing my shit. Ya'll know. But yeah, Johnny is laying in my bed watching Dude, Wheres My Car, so I am gonna go join him...hubba hubba hey...lol jp (that was for you mom)"

I am sooooooooo tired of crying. My eyes are all puffy. Tim, this guy I talk to at college, asked me if I was all strung up or something. I was like...""Uh, nooo..."" It was lovely. And I told him a lot about what has been going on with me and he was like ""When I was 19, this guy told me that when Im all grown up, you will be able to count the number of true friends on one hand."" I was like, ""Tim, Im 19 and I can already to the: Jess, Pennell, Johnny, KC....Justin sometimes... He said ""Thats all a girl needs. Who needs a whole asswad of friends?

A sweet, calm smile rests on my face, 
But if you stare into my eyes, 
Storm clouds billow and churn, 
Tears glaze like rainy day skies. 

I haven't seen the sun 
Since I don't know when, 
A misty gray shroud 
Blocks and clouds my vision.

My life's been taken over 
By a sadistic grandfather clock.
Time haunts and taunts me, 
There's no way to keep up. 

But if you ask me how I've been,
Invariably I'll look up and grin; 
For what more is there to say 
Besides, ""Oh, I'm OK.""

This is how I feel these days. I cried sooooo much today. KC didnt know, but she is gonna find out when she reads this. But yeah. I was even clean about it. Put make up on and splashed cold water on my face like 10 mins b4 she got home. I didnt want her to know. I am trying to be stronger, or at least fake it, for me, for KC, for Jess, for Jodie. I hate going to work every other day bc I have to put on a ""happy face"" and it bothers me. It makes me feel all 2faced and shit. I hate it. I tried analyzing myself all night tonight and came up with nothing. Too bad Nora is shoved up Mouses ass...she used to analyze me. Yep. Me and KC are going through pictured right now. Kinda fun. I hate being so sleepy. If I'd stop crying I'd have more energy. I hate this. I wanna get better. I wanna see someone but I cant afford that, though Im getting $50 from the Bay City Times for my article they want to publish. I am still a lil excited. It is the highlight of my....month. Man, I thought of Lenny today for no reason and secretly hoped my cell would ring. I should be the bigger man and call him, but I dont want him to know that I think about him from ""time to time."" Who am I kidding. I think about him more than I like to admit. GOD! I just wanna scream at the top of my lungs 'til I turn blue in the face and pass out for a while. I know you guys know the feeling.

I worked and was fine, but as soon as I got home I got all depressed and shit and went into my room, and watched a movie. Then I listened to some music and cried and cried and cried.

Find someone who will talk to you, who you can see, hang with, have fun with, but I cant. I am finding it INCREDIBLY HARD! I had a dream the other night that I called Nora and told her I was dying.

Yeah, as you can tell that ISNT working. I cant get him outta my head. I dont know if that has to d owith my depression or not. Im sure it has part of it. Also the whole living situation...nuff said.

I put myself into the shoes of the song...relate my situation to it. You know how it is. I just want to hit shit and scream at the top of my lungs. I think it would make me feel better.

Its aight now though. lol So yeah, I feel like I could go on and on and on and on but I dont wanna bore ya. That and I dont really wanna type my life story out anymore for people to read."

"event","So, this is my first live journal entry. Kace told me I should do it, so here I am. Ok, let me start off by saying I HATE attachment. I am soooo attached to Lenny it isnt funny. And I really shouldn't be. I havent talked to him in almost 2 weeks, aside from online, but that doesn't count. I dont know what it is...I just...ugh! I cant even put it into words. KC dared me to call his house tonight so I did and they said I JUST missed him. OH MAN! There are like 3 guys up here that wanna hook up with me...2 for sure. One is taken and has 2 kids and one on the way, but he says that doesnt matter. It does to me!! The other is 16 from Whittemore. Jess' friend. He is sweet and cool and funny, but I dont feel that way about him. Why the fan club all of the sudden? The other will remain annonymous bc I dont wanna jinx it. I liked him last year, and it was mutual, but then we both found out and things got kinda awkword. I dont know why, just did. 
There was a good sized party here on Saturday. I had a blast...5 1/2 smirnoffs and 1 1/2 beers later. Amber is pissed, but I am at the point where I could give 2 shits less. She'll miss me and come crawling back sooner or later. lol She has been real bitchy to me lately...bc I dont take hers or Brandons shit. UGH! Oh fucking well...boo fucking hoo.
For some weird reason I kinda miss Nora. Even if she is a cuntmaster5000 to me and ditched me for a guy...yet AGAIN! Fuck that shit. We just had a lot of good times. THOSE WERE THE DAYS! For real! I had fun...and met her cousin! ;)"

"event","I have to write something thats been on my mind for some time.

Ok, to start from the top....

Megan Eager is a girl I met back in High School.  She was a freshman when I was a junior.  She flirted with me a little bit here and there.  We went on an official ""date"" when we were in my senior year I believe it was.  I can remember exactly where, when, what she wore, how she smelled, where we sat in the movie theater, what we saw, and what flavor lip gloss she had on.  For me, it was mostly a physical attraction.  Things went way too fast to be anything serious.  She said something in the car that made me think she was taking it more serious than I was, and it kind of freaked me out so I backed off.  She doesn't know, I dont think, what I was thinking.  I feel bad because I felt like I led her on.

Then, last february, I ran into her again at CHS when I was visiting some people.  We exchanged numbers again.  I told her I was sorry for what happened before, and I realized she was really a great girl and I wanted to get to know her more.  That part was true.  We went out again on Valentines day.  We went bowling, played pool, and watched a movie.  Things ended up going too fast again, because I was still pretty physically attracted to her.  But I was serious about her being a great girl I wanted to get to know.

What makes this all difficult is that she really seemed to honestly care alot about me.  

Now, its months later, and for like the past 2 weeks I can't stop thinking about her.  I just want to be with her again, and not just in a physical attraction sense, altho she is really beautiful.  She's a lot of fun and I had a great time the last time we went out.  I would like to do something like that again, only this time control myself and not let things go to fast.  I would not like to live with regrets or live wondering ""what if"".  

My conflict lies in that I am not sure if these thoughts are from God, or from Satan trying to distract me from God's will. I am going to call her tomorow.  I just have to know."

The new 311 cd has really grown on me.  Its like theres no song on there that I don't love.  I could seriously listen to the whole thing straight through and want to listen to it again and again.

At phone team training tonite, we talked about what it would take to start Diamond qualification by March (which would get you the new Diamond bonus of potentially a million dollars).  I would have to sponsor 24 people in the next 3-4 months, which is 6-8 people a month.  Theres absolutely no reason I can't do that.  It would just take exactly what I'm doing right now, but a bit more.  And I KNOW I can do it.  So my mantra now is Diamond qualification by March 1st, Ultimate Eagle by December 1st, Eagle by September 1st.  That would get me qualified Diamond by September 1st 2004.  DONE DEAL!"

Our open meeting for the BWW/Quixtar business was tonite, and I had 2 guests, and one of them brought a guest.  One of my guests, the one who brought a guest, will be signing up thursday, as will his guest.  So that will put me at 7 wide, once Steve signs up.  I am excited about going eagle!!

"event","I was checking a profile of a friend of mine, and it linked to his online journal.  I was reminded of my old one (this one) and decided to check it.  What I found was incredible...

I was taken back to a time that seems like ages ago, but really was just a short 7 or 8 months ago.  My how things have changed.

First of all, I am now working part time waiting tables at LoneStar Steakhouse.  While I do really look forward to quitting that job, it's a heck of a lot more tolerable than my office job.  I am also working part time at Aeropostale.  

My business (the one refered to in recent posts as the Quixtar business) is going quite well.  It really does work, and I have witnessed hundreds upon hundreds of people who are making some serious cash in it.  All I can say is that it has changed my life completely.  

I had some junk to get through, and that is why it has taken as long as it has to make it to where I can honestly say I will be able to quit my job by february or march.  I KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt that I will and can do it now.  Theres no doubt in my mind.  I just had some really stupid stuff in my head I had to work through in order to make it to where I am.

I am also now a born again Christian.  My how that has changed my life.  And it happened at a BWW function, of all places.  Who'da thought?  It has totally changed my life having Christ as my pilot.  I've gotten more into the Word and have learned more about the Word in the past 6 months than I did in all my years going to community church.  I guess when your ready to recieve knowledge, you recieve it in a big way.  I would also attribute the major changed in my life in the past 6 months to having Christ in my life.  I mean, for the first 19.5 years of my life, I was without Christ, even though I was baptized when I was young.  I was living a lie, so to speak.  But having accepted Him as my personal savior has changed everything.  

I am reading an incredible book series called the Left Behind series.  Its fictional, but based entirely off the book of Revelation.  It's really a good series.  I understand what will happen in the end times, which I feel are nearer than most people realize.  

I have realized my path and my calling in life.  It's to build my business so big, that thousands of people come to know the Lord like I have because of my network.  I can't take the credit for them knowing the Lord; that is Him at work.  I can only show them the truth, it's up to them to accept it.  

Well this is a lot and I'm fairly sure I've missed some things, but lets just say my life has changed drastically in the past 7-8 months.  I am totally happy, excited about where my life is going, have a 100% better attitude, 100% better self image, and KNOW I am going to succeed.  And if you don't like it, take a long walk off a short pier into a drinking glass full of sharks."

first, i'll go over yesterday:

took 2 finals, i'm so sick of school. then i met adam sage and amber at ambers house because we were all going to the sevendust concert in grand rapids.  we were going to meet paul at his appartment on the way there.  everything cool up till now.  after concert is over, which is like midnite, we get back to pauls to chill for a little bit at around 1am.  keep in mind that at this point i'm on not very much sleep from past late nites studying for finals. and i also have (had) work thursday morning at 730.  we decide to leave at 3. at 3 they ask to stay just a half hour longer.  now i KNEW this would turn into being later, but i said as long as it doesnt i dont mind.  sure enough, 330 turned into 345, turned into us getting to ambers at 5 am, turned into me getting home at 540, just in time to explain why i was home so late, just in time to get ready to go to work.  the only sleep i got was for about 45 mins riding in the back of adams car on the way home.  

ugh..

i'll put some more up.  i changed my mind i'm too tired to recap some more.  i'm literally almost falling asleep at my computer."

I'm dissapointed at the crap Daves giving me.  I can understand him looking out for me.  But he has been the most negative out of everyone about this.  He's my best friend and like a brother, but if he's going to be nothing but negative, then I dont want to be around that.  I'm happy hanging around the people I do, because they're positive people.  If nothing else, if this absolutely is nothing but a scam, I'm going to grow so much as a person, and get such a good attitude change from it.  But I know its much more than that.

I'm quitting delphi, he didnt like that.  I'm risking $100 to start a business, he doesn't like that.  wonder what else im not going to get support in..........even if this isnt a good idea, and it turns out he was right the whole time, itd be nice if he just said ""well your going to make your own decisions, and i'll support you and let you learn on your own"".  i know he's just trying to look out for me, but i dont know what from.  it seems like he has this idea that i have to live a typical life, and make my decisions that are his, i mean fuck, can't i do what i want sometimes? i've worked myself for the past year straight, i haven't had much time to myself.  sure i dont work at nite, but i haven't been able to really stay out that late in a while, except for on the weekends, and those aren't really that fun.  im sick of living a normal boring life.  i want to do what i want to do, not what I'm limited to because of time and money.  and if this turns out to be a good investment, then hell, i'll be damned glad i got into it.  so what if its going to take a couple years before im making a lot of money off it? i don't expect to get rich over nite, or rich without doing any work.  those types of ""deals"" are the scams.  you have to work for money no matter what you do, but this business gives better pay for what you do.  why can't i just make my own damned decisions and learn for myself?  man if i had the money right now, i'd so so so so move out."

Well I should be getting my computer sometime next week.  The people I was buying from FINALLY got my money, and now they have to build/test it.  Testing is 48 hours, and then they send it out.  So I'm figuring sometime next week, I'll get it.  

Man I hope the business with Quixtar gets really big.  If all goes as planned, I hope to not have an actual job by the time I'm 20.  If I can be making $1000 or more a month by that time, I'll be sitting good.  

Well we got Version D for Soul Calibur 2 finally.  Its a lil different, but nothing REAL big.  I think I'm getting pretty good at it.  If I can just stop making dumb mistakes, and be a little bit more technical, I think I'll be really good.

Dave and I and bunch of other guys are getting into a program called Quixtar, which is an online business.  What it is, is when we sign up, we become Independent Business Owners (IBO's).  We sell products (which includes pretty much anything you can buy in a store) online, at retail price, or at wholesale price to members.  We make a percent profit.  Every person we get to join as an IBO under us, we make profit off them.  And so on.  Apparently, if you continue in this, and do everything this guy says, you can be set for life.  The guy who is getting Dave in has been in it for about 6 years, and he's about ready to go to making a million dollars A YEAR.  Thats crazy amounts of money.  But shit, if I can be 25, and be set for life financially, I'm all for it."

<i>Spinning around,
Hands were held tonite.
Dizzy is she, 
Thinking of me.

Stars up in the sky,
They shimmer white.
You feel as though your soul is
Beating bright.

Tonite, let us look beyond the door,
To the other side.
The world where dreamers die.
Truth becomes us.
We're lost in paradise.
Reality's a lie; 
Known for being five more than you'll ever be. </i>

<B><U>First topic, dreams:</U></B> All of my dreams lately seem to be really really good ones.  I can't really explain how good I feel in them.  It's not overall happiness.  It's not one aspect of happiness.  It's completely happy in all ways.  And when I wake up, there is such a strong desire to go back to that place.  Its like I'm getting a little taste of heaven in each one.  I'm never upset, I don't have any worries, I don't think about responsibilities, and everything is right and no one does anything wrong.  Its amazing stuff.  

<B><U>Weird:</U></B> So I got a phone call this morning....at 6:10 am.  That's the first reason this phone call is weird.  Second of all, it was from ""Amber"".  Now, the only Amber I know I haven't talked to in months and months and months.  And (assuming it WAS her) for her to call me out of the blue like that, is kinda weird.  But if it WAS her, it'd sure be nice to talk to her, since it's been so long.

"event","I will probably be quitting delphi sooner than the end of the semester. I just can't take it, the getting up early like every fucking morning. Its not the workload that stresses me.......its not even the people.....its just simply the getting up so damned early.  And the fact that because I have to get up so early, I cant go out and spend time with my friends when I want to at nite.  

My dad brought up a couple points.  One, if I quit delphi, make sure its not because of my friends, and that its because of me.  first of all, im not quitting delphi so i can fit my friends schedule, like he was saying. i dont see the harm in wanting to live my life while i can and enjoy time with my friends.  my friends are a HUGE part of my life.   and despite what he may think (based on how he talks) my friends arent a bunch of jobless losers who dont go to school and whose lives are going nowhere. 
Whats the point in living if you cant enjoy life? If i'm constantly working, i cant enjoy myself.  if i get one day a week to sleep in, i cant enjoy myself. if i'm constantly struggling between ""am i gonna break this time and just stay out late even tho im supposed to get up early? or am i gonna ditch my friends because of work?"", i cant enjoy myself.  

the other point he made was if i quit delphi will i still be making enough at lonestar that i can pay my car loan and insurance? well fuck...i had BETTER be making at least $200 a month.......i could make that at a fucking minimum wage job.....

im just feeling so........tired.....drained......mentally.......physically.......emotionally..........frustrated, trapped, afraid of making the wrong decision.  afraid of disappointing people.  not wanting to have to explain it to everyone. 

well id better go for now, so i can eat lunch and do some work at the same time........i dont even care about this job anymore...i hate working in an office.....

Now that thats cleared up.......

I'm so fucking physically and mentally drained right now.......this two jobs and school thing is killing me....My emotional bucket, so to speak, has also almost run out.  I'm finding it increasingly difficult to tolerate people's shit and in general just be nice if I don't want/have to. No sleep is really taking its toll on me too, I'm forgetting major things, like to put in people's orders at work.  Then I get shit tips cuz they waited forever. Life seriously sucks hardcore right now...Its really hard to make myself get up and do it all over again each week, every morning.  I have ONE day thats not as bad as the rest, and when I say ""not as bad"", I mean ""not as bad because I only have school and ONE job"".  Yeah.....""only""....I'm seriously condsidering trying to save like mad and quitting BOTH my jobs at the end of the semester, and just using my saved up money to live off of for like a month or two.  I really just need some time to relax, some time to myself, some time to do what I want for a change.  

Fun? Whats that? For me, ""fun"" has taken on a new definition.  ""Fun"" used to be staying up all nite with friends, partying on the weekends, sleeping in late on the weekends....but now, since I cant really do that anymore, ""fun"" is being able to go and hang out at the mall for an hour before I have to go to work from my other work, being able to sleep in an extra 2 hours on the weekend because I have to be to work at noon, looking forward to going to fencing on thursdays....

"event","I had a simple realization this morning.  All I am right now is a drone.  I'm going to get up early every morning and do the same shit I do every week whether I want to or not.  Its not really a choice any more.  Until the end of the semester, I'm going to continually be tired all the time and sacrifice sleep just so I can enjoy my life a little bit.  Staying out late isnt really my choice either.  Its like this: The sicker I get of work and school, the more I will want to stay out.  Like last night for instance, I just gave in.  It wasn't really a choice.  More of a ""whats it fucking matter, I'm gonna be tired anyways.""  I really do not like my life right now.  There are a few things keeping it going.  1. Hanging out with my friends.  2. Soul Calibur.  3. The computer that I will eventually have the money for.  4. Talking to a new girl, alisson (who knows where that is going...hopefully, we can get to know each other better, i know i want to).  5. Looking forward to sundays when i actually get to sleep in.  

But no matter how tired I am, how much I hate having two jobs, I'm going to do it no matter if I want to or not.  Until I have the few things that I'd like to buy, my life is not about what I want to do.  Seems my life revolves around saving money, and trying to enjoy my free time.  Like today for instance. Didn't eat breakfast cuz I wasn't hungry.  Lunch time comes, and I have $2, cuz I didnt want to break the $20's I have at home cuz I need that to pay insurance.  So I get a burger and a pop.  I probaly won't eat anything the rest of the day, no matter how hungry I get.  Why? Because then I'd have to pull cash out of my savings.  Pathetic...

I'm seriously thinking of skipping class tonite just to have a night to myself.  When the end of the semester comes, I've decided to say 'fuck you delphi', and also 'fuck you hard classes'.  I'm going to have ONE job, and easy classes that aren't early.  I dont want to have to study really hard, do lots of homework, or work my ass off to just to get what I want.  I don't like having to miss out on hanging out with friends just cuz I have to go to work in the morning.  I dont like feeling fucking tired as hell all the time.  After the semester is done, I'm going back to one job, and when I get the other half of my scholarship, I'm paying off the rest of my loan, so I can cut my monthy car payments down to $130 instead of $200. 

I'm turning into someone I dont want to be, and too fast.  I dont want to be the kind of person that works his ass off all the time and doesnt get to enjoy life.  I'd rather be just barely making it as far as money goes and enjoying life, than having little to no time and working my ass of, but having a lot of money.  

Can someone just trade lives with me for like a week, so I can sleep for 168 hours? I seriously think I hate my life...I'm just so exhausted I can't really explain it.  Yesterday, instead of sleeping in and relaxing on sunday, I waited tables for about 9 hours, and then I stayed up until 230 because I was sick of work and school, but I got up at 8 anyways because all I am is just a damned drone whos going to do it no matter if I want to or if I just want to sleep some more.  Fuck my health, who needs health? 

Oh on a sidenote, Tony is a fucking idiot and I cant believe he tries to have a conversation with people that are smarter than he, which is like everyone.  Plus he's a constant smart ass. 

Goodbye everyone."

"event","I had something just completely make my day yesterday.  A simple, 5 minute conversation about nothing in particular, with a guy I had never met.  

Ok, it was after I got out of fencing class, before I went to the mall.  I stopped at McDonalds to get some food, cuz I didnt have much money on me.  I originally was just gonna get it to go, and eat on the way to the mall, but after I got my stuff I changed my mind and I sat down at an empty table.  A few seconds later, a guy who worked there (musta been in his 40s, he was Top Dizzog I later found out, 25 years of being there), sat down across from me, and ate some food on his break.  And we just talked about nothing in particular. 

Now you may be asking, ""How could that possibly make your day?"" Well after I left, I was thinking, [i]out of everyone that he could have sat down next to, or out of any other place in back he could have taken his break, he decided to be nice and sit down by me, just sitting by myself, and have a talk about nothing conversation[i].  You have absolutely no idea how much I appreciate things like that.   People being nice when theres the opportunity to be, but they don't neccessarily have to be.  They just do it to be nice, for no other reason at all, or just to maybe brighten someone's day.  When people are nice like that, it totally makes my day.  I really believe that people are inherently good, and want to do good, but sometimes stress gets to them and they get angry and vent their emotions through physical or verbal assault.  

I'm starting to love playing Soul Calibur again.  This is the first arcade game that I can actually say I'm good/pretty damned decent at.  Its really just a lot of fun.  Either that or I'm getting more and more addicted ^_^"

Not much new, cept I met a really cool girl online last nite.  Angela W-something...she's 17 and a freshman at SVSU.  Seems pretty cool, and apparently she's friends with John P (I think thats the John who I dont know his last name and lives out in BFE....correct me if I'm wrong).  but anyways, yea..she seems nice...

hey! soul calibur is sposed to be fixed today! maybe I'll head over there before work....I GOTSTA get my fix on!  Speaking of 'fix', I prolly should call Nuffer's soon, to get my window fixed.  What with it getting cold outside and all....

I'm reconsidering buying from Dell, and thinkning about trying to build a computer myself.  I could probably have my dad help me out, and I think if I built it myself, it would be a really good learning experience and especially if something went wrong and I had to fix it.  Apparently, if you buy from a company, they are crap computers compared to if you built it yourself.  I'll hafta look at prices to see....

Well, gotta go for now, later y'all...........ha, i said yall....

"event","What a long weekend.  Friday, I worked all day at my office job, then I.....dont quite remember what I did friday.............hm.  Oh yeah, I went to my mom's cuz it was her birthday thursday.  I'd like to see things for once go for the better for her.  She doesnt bring things upon herself, and deserves none of what she gets (all the bad stuff i mean).  After that I went out with some friends.  

Saturday, bowling, then home, then went to a party in saginaw that kinda sucked, but hey it was kinda fun too.  We played lots of dave matthews band music, so it was worth it. 

Sunday, I worked at LS for the first time by myself.  It went pretty good i thought.  But i made crap tips, we were really slow, i only got 5 tables all nite, and one guy stiffed me good, with a crappy 2 dollar tip.  i only made like 23 bucks in tips. 

OH, saturday I went to the mall too.  To see steph.  But apparently, she went to the mall not to see me, but to see her friends that she sees all the time, cept for one.  She said something to me that was quite rude also, joking or not.  That day confused me. 

But now after reading her latest journal entry, I am finally brought back into the loop of what the hell is going on.  Its nice to know what a girl is feeling instead of trying to guess.  She says one thing, and then writes something completely different.  I didnt know what to think.  But now i know finally.  I was feeling led on for a lil bit.  But saturday cleared things up.  I mean, if she came to the mall to see me, but then just leaves with her other friends to go walk around the mall, not saying anything to me as to where they were going, just left as if i werent even there, what was i supposed to think? 

I really dont think I could ever be more than just a friend.  Several reasons why.  Several good reasons.  And sure I like talking to her, but I dont like feeling obligated to call every single day, and feeling bad if I don't.  Calling in the morning is a lil weird also.  

But I'm glad I finally know whats going on.  I was thinking that I wasn't going to put my life on pause just because I wasn't sure as to where we were going.  

boy am i glad we took these last week or 2 weeks to get to know each other better. 

In better news......well...um.........fencing rulz!  me dave and ryan fenced each other sunday nite.  But the bad part was that i sacrficed much needed study time, because i had a math test today, that i found i wasn't quite prepared for.  Ill be lucky to get a B on it, but had i studied, i know i could have A'ed it. 

Only a couple more days till we get soul calibur back!!!

I feel like I'm leaving something out....I'll just leave with some lyrics i guess..

But she says ""Please!""
""There's a crazy man creepin' outside my door.
""I live on the corner of Grey Street,
""And the end of the world."""

With me doing homework at nite, and working two jobs, and going to school...i literally have next to no time to do anything else.  i have SOME time on the weekends....but this sacrificing time for money thing is something ill have to get used to.  I work about 10 total hours today, and have 3 hours of school.  i will probably be up for 2 hours after work (homework, computer, guitar, callin steph) and i was up an hour and a half before work started.  that means out of 16.5 hours of being awake today, 13 of those were spent at work or school.  3.5 hours out of my day ""to myself"".  riiiiiight.

i have to give a demonstration speech in public speaking next week.  basically, we have to show/teach the class how to do something.  i was really clueless for a while as to what i was going to do...but then last nite it became quite obvious what i should do.  origami!  i used to be way into it when i was younger, and for 7 years i did it.  that would be something easy to teach, cheap materials so the rest of the class can do it, and its a ""cool"" topic.  i didnt want to do something dumb, or something id feel dumb teaching.  i think this will work quite nicely. 

things with steph are good.  i still call her everyday, and in fact she told me to call her that much.  we're in the ""ok ok, that was a lil quick......lets back off and get to know each other a lil better first"" period.  which is good, its how it [b]should[/b] happen. she's a great girl, but more important, a great friend, and thats what we'll need to build off of."

"event","Is update what happened since the weekend. 

Friday I worked a fuckin' lot.  830 am until about 1030 pm.  Then i went home and slept. Oh yeah, also, and I dont know if this was friday or not, but steph told me she just wants to be friends.  Many reasons, I'll cover some more on this later.  Saturday, I had to get up early to bowl, and then I went and spent $20 at the arcade.  Then I worked from 3 until about 11. Then went to Boz's and had a Smirnoff Ice, and just relaxed for a few hours, until I went home around 3am.  Sunday, I was SUPPOSED to study most of the day, but I ended up eating dinner with my mom, and having my lil bro's 9th birthday party.

Ok, now that THAT'S outta the way...

Now that Steph has come out and said she just wants to be friends.....Ive realized some things.  First of all, I am brought back down to reality, and Logical Jaron is now in full command.  I was sorta on an emotional high for a couple weeks there, and I didn't see some things.  I just wasnt using my head.  

Second, Ive had some realizations about myself.  One thing is that I always seem to be more into the girl and the relationship than the girl does.  It almost ALWAYS happens that way.  Emily: I always felt like she didn't take us that seriously.  I loved that girl, but I somehow feel that it was far less than mutual.  Kristi: no need to explain there.  Another thing about me is that I tend to fall for a girl pretty quickly.  Depends on the girl tho, I dont just fall for anyone. 

Third, Ive had some realizations about girls in general.  Why do girls not like guys who are intimate and show it?  The thing that brought this question up is when Steph said my hugs were ""too intimate"".  I didn't think you could be too intimate.  Blah...

Ive also realized that I will have next to no life for a while, until this school year is done.  Because I'm working two jobs and going to school full time.  Maybe I won't take as many credits......or work as much....or SOMETHING.  But I really need a break.  I dont remember what 3 months of summer to myself is like.  I want that. I want little responsibility, and be able to stay out late and sleep in.  I hope all is not lost, and because I have entered the ""adult"" world, that I wont ever get to see those days again...."

I start my first day of training at Lonestar today, 5-about 10pm.  So thats 12 hours I will have worked today.  Fun stuff.  Tomorow will be long too, because I have bowling at 9am, Im going to the mall afterwards to play some SC2, and then I work from 3-11.  Good thing I have sunday off.

I think I have to admit something that I really don't want to.  Maybe I'll write about it later, but that's all Im gonna say right now.  I really hope Steph's OK, with her mom and everything.  With my 2nd job, I won't get to see her hardly at all :( .

I start my other job today.  I'm gonna be a server at LoneStar.  I figure I'll be making almost DOUBLE what I make at Delphi.  The sacrifice is that I'll have a lot less free time.  But I think it'll be worth it.  I'm still planning on getting a computer, and Dave showed me a website that has some hella nice ones, but a little on the 'spensive side.  One of them I was looking at was $1700.  That had a lot of nice specs, like 2.4ghz P4, 512mb memory, 64mb GForce graphics card, and some other nice stuff.  The one dave was considering was $2400.  He was gonna do a monthy payment thing.  Im still waiting to hear back from their sales department (if you wanna check out the website, I just remembered I never said what it was yet.  well its <url>http://www.alienware.com</url>) as to what their payment options are.  I might go monthly, and I might just go with my original plan to pay cash.  

I've decided that I'm not going to work at Delphi this summer, regardless of whether I am able to or not.  I'll be making more money at my other job, plus I dont like working at Delphi.  That only leaves one good thing about Delphi (well, two) and those are the consistent hours, and the fact that it looks good on a resume.

last nite i skipped the last half of chemistry to go out to eat with Boz (guy from one of my classes) at Damons.  They usually have trivia, but stupid sucky-ass football was on, so we did this weird thing where you try to predict the play (run or pass) and the direction (left, mid, or right) and how far (back, short, or deep).  you get points for how correct you are.  fun i guess.  then i got home at 1040 and called steph, and talked to her for a lil while.  

yknow its weird....even if we don't talk about anything in particular....i dont feel that sense of ""well....that phone call was kinda.....pointless..."" the way i would if it were a different girl that i had just met.  just the fact that i get to talk to her and the fact that i get to hear her voice is good.  we don't have to talk about anything in particular for me to be glad about talking to her.  

after that i looked for some stuff around the house for my stupid speech i have to give about me.  

woke up hella early (6am) and i was wrong about being more tired at 8am.  fuck that, i could fall over right now.  i have to leave in about 5 minutes to go to class....but yea, i called steph again this morning to talk for a few minutes.  its weird...normally, a girl wouldn't like it if i called so early.....or so often.  but steph ASKED me to call in the morning.  thats really great...god do i think about her enough or what?  between her and soul calibur, im surprised i even have any other thoughts at all :)

Welcome to another edition of Weekend Update, with yours truly.  And what a weekend it was.  Heres what happened:

<b><u>Friday:</u></b>  yahoo! Stephanie Day!!  It was soo good to see her, and hold her hand, and hold her tight...wow.  Shes the best, I swear.  Friday nite was the arcade lock in/freeplay and that was hella fun too.  I was there until 2:30 am.  I think I called steph when i got home, I dont remember I was pretty tired hehe.  I didnt get to see her the rest of the weekend :( but friday was definitely the highpoint of my week.

<b><u>Saturday:</u></b> I had to get up early for bowling at 9am. Needless to say I was pretty damned tired.  The good part was that after not bowling for 3 years, I was still pretty decent.  I even managed to pick up a 6-7 split - pretty damned tough if you know bowling (id say its the next hardest split, next to a 7-10).  After that I went home and took a 2 hour nap, got up at 1, and went to the mall for the Soul Calibur 2 tourney.  I didnt do that good, but it was still a lot of fun and I learned a bunch.  I talked to steph some more on the phone (yay) and later that nite i went to daves to game.  That didnt end up happening because not enough ppl showed up, so we just played a lot of DC.  I left at 1230 because I was tired, and then I called steph when i got home.  

<b><u>Sunday:</u></b> got woken up at 11am by my dad, asking if i wanted to go boating.  since i dont do much with my dad anymore (cuz of school, and now cuz of starting a second job), i said ok.  we were on the water from about 1 until sundown.  It was such a beautiful day.  The sunset was even better.  I realized something.  All the times I see beautiful things - be it a dark starry night, a sunset, whatever...and I think of Steph, its not just that I want her to be there with me, but I want to share that experience with her, cuz I think she'd appreciate it...I talk about her an awful lot, heh...an easy thing to do when one person is on your mind all day :)

Sunday nite, came home, called Steph, but only for a half hour.  then I played some guitar, and worked on a song that is STILL not finished.  Then i went to bed. 

That wraps up this edition of Weekend Update.  Now for some miscellaneous comments that don't have much to do with anything!

- I think Ive found the absolute WORST time for me to wake up.  Its 8am.   I woke up today even MORE tired than I am when i have to wake up at 6.  I was almost falling asleep in my first class, at 11am.  I know its not from lack of sleep because i went to bed at midnite last nite.

- Something I thought about today. Well, not JUST today, but Ive thought about it before, and am just now writing it down. As far as looks goes, there are several different levels/degrees:

a)Cute
b)Hot
c)Attractive
d)Sexy
e)Beautiful

And on MY scale of desirablility, it goes like: 

Attractive < Cute < Sexy < Hot < Beautiful

Of course, this doesn't include anything before attractive.  And also, this is ONLY taking looks into account.  A girl with a cute personality is far more desirable than a sexy girl with a bad or missing personality.  

Another thing to be said about the scale: On any given level, that level will have the attributes of the level and all levels below it.  Example: Beautiful.  A beautiful girl will have all the attributes of being beautiful, but also the attributes of 'sexy', 'hot', 'cute', and 'attractive', because through beauty, I can see all the other elements of the different levels.  

For personality there is a different scale:

a)Fun
b)Crazy
c)Eccentric
d)Beautiful
e)Nice
f)Genuine/Sincere

And on MY scale of desirability, it goes like this:

Crazy < Unique < Fun < Nice < Genuine/Sincere < Beautiful

And the same rules apply for this scale.  A girl with a truly beautiful personality can/will be genuine/sincere, nice, fun, unique, and yes, sometimes crazy :).  

One thing to note about both scales: They are not totally separate.  The looks scale doesn't have much (if any at all) influence on the personality scale, but the Personality scale *can* have a big influence on the looks scale.  And each level has certain degrees in itself.  Like a girl can be more or less beautiful than another.  

If you know me....try and guess where YOU fit on the scales :)

- There are some things in life that you can't explain, and don't need explaining.  In the past week, I have encountered several examples.  We'll just take a look at one: Homosexuality/bisexuality.  While I do think its wrong, its MORE wrong for me to say that other people are wrong for being who they are, than it is for me to say that its wrong for me.  Its something that does exist and it is real, and is something that I can't explain, but just have to accept that its there.  Love is love, I suppose...which brings me to my next point.

- I'm rereading a VERY good book, called ""Tuesdays With Morrie"".  Its about a man who goes back to visit one of his old college professors, who he looked up to, like a mentor.  His professors name is Morrie, and his is Mitch.  Morrie is dying of ALS (Lou Gherrig's Disease) and when Mitch finds out, he goes back to visit him.  I'd like to share with you all (all meaning whoever reads my journal...) an exerpt from the book.  It will be paraphrased since I dont have it with me right now, but I wanna post it anyways.  Mitch is the one narrating.

""Have I ever told you about the tension of opposites?"" he asks me.
'Tension of opposites?'
""Life is full of opposites, choices between doing what is expected of you and doing what you want.  Its like the pull of a giant rubber band.  Most people lie somewhere in the middle,"" he tells me.
'Sounds like a wrestling match.'
""Yes,"" he laughs, ""a wrestling match. A good way of thinking about it.""
'So which side wins?' I ask him.
""Love. Love <i>always</i> wins.""

(end) And that really made me think.  It really is true, whether its someone you love, or something you love to do.  Love will always win all of your decisions.  

I guess thats about all for now.  I should get back to ""work"".  I got class later after work, and Im gonna call steph before class.  So I will see all you, all my unknown anonymous readers of my journal, I will see you all later, when I next update the awesome events of my life.

Lata."

"event","I talked to Steph a bunch yesterday.  From the time I got home from the arcade (around 630) till about 11ish, with a few short breaks in between for eating, I was talking to her either on the phone or on AIM.  And before I went to bed, I wrote her an email.  Its like the more I talk to her, the more I feel a really strong connection, like I have known her for a long time.  

But really I met her a lil under 2 weeks ago, and have been actually talking to her for less than 1 week.  

I can't explain how or why this all happened, and how it has happened so quickly.  And normally I am cautious about getting into a relationship this fast.  But this all feels so right, like its sposed to happen.....like someone ::looks up:: up there is saying ""Ok jaron, your going to meet stephanie, and you two are going to find that you both fit so well with each other"".  


Last nite she told me something that really got to me.  She said that for the longest time, she wasn't really happy much and didnt ever smile....and after she met me, she couldn't stop smiling.  I got kind of choked up at that.  It was such an incredible feeling, I don't know how to describe it...but knowing that I affected someone in such a good way....I could have broke down right there hearing her say that.

What's happening, and why? I'm not arguing/fighting it, in fact I like it, alot.  But it really makes me think.....that it all means something. Something good.  Something very good."

I used to think that age meant something in a relationship.  I used to have a general rule, that I would not date a girl that was more than 2 years younger than me, because I believed the maturity levels would not be the same.  And for the most part, I thought my generalization was true.

Then I met Stephanie.

She is 4 years younger than me, at 15.  She looks like 16, and has the maturity of 17.  She is cute, nice, fun to be with and talk to, and talking to her is as easy as if I were talking to someone I have known for a long time.  And having my arms around her just feels so good. 

I think about her all the time now.  Even tho I haven't known her for that long.

That being said...

I have a new idea of what relationships are about.  They are about two people making a connection, having their minds and souls meet on the same level.  When you take the time to get to know someone first, you are finding out on what level they are on and then adjusting to meet them there.  But its possible to already be on the same level.  Thats how I feel: that Steph and I are already on the same level. 

On top of all this, just a few days ago I started reading a book called ""Tuesdays With Morrie"".  I'm almost done now, and it is one of the most inspirational books I've ever read.  It has inspired me to live like I always thought I should live.  I highly recommend it.  

Just a week ago, I was alone, and at times a bitter person...with these good things happening all at once, it makes me wonder.

I think God is a mover and a shaker."

Lots of deep thoughts and ponderances on life, on my life, and on what will happen if things don't change. I'm really competitive, whether it be a simple game between friends, or a big competition.  Bottom line, I don't like to lose.  Well, rather, I don't like to lose ALL THE TIME.  Losing once in a while in a friendly thing is ok...but losing all the time I hate.  

I think I'm less of a nice person/open minded person than I used to be.  I don't know why."

"event","My chest hurts the same if not more than it did yesterday.  After work I took a 4 hour nap, and then went to bed at 11:30 last nite, and I still woke up tired as hell.  My head kinda hurts today, and I feel sorta dizzy.  I feel kinda out of it.  Why am I at work you ask? Because I need money.  I hate my life. 

I had a weird ass dream last nite.  I'm not sure if you can call it a dream.  It felt so much like I was awake and it was all real.  It all started when I was 'woken up' suddenly by my radio turning on.  It didn't really turn on, but I thought for sure it did.  I could even hear it.  When I sat up to check it, it wasn't on.  So I tried to go back to sleep.  It came on again, and I thought for sure I was still awake.  Then I found that I could mentally turn it on and off.  Another thing happened, my sister just ran into my room, started talking fast about something I don't remember, and then left.  She came back in again, same way, talking fast again, and sat on my bed for a second, then left.  Scary kinda.  I don't know it all felt real.  I tried to ask her what she was doing, and it was very hard to talk or move.  

I don't think I'll ever get 'enough' sleep.  I hope my chest stops hurting. This is the most uncomfortable pain ever.  It would be different if it were spread out more, and if it was a soreness.  But its not.  Its in one spot, and its more a stabbing pain.  It hurts to breathe deep.  It hurts when I go down stairs too fast.  It hurts more when my heart beats faster.  I hate this. 

I feel like I'm still half asleep."

But I've been eating a lot less lately.  Not really out of choice...I just get full on a lot less.  Even if I am like stomach cramp starving.  Sometimes it out of choice, but thats just because nothing sounds good.  And I don't always like eating crap junk food or fast food for dinner.  I've been drinking a lot more pop tho.....not so much in the past few days, but...I just get fuller than I usually would off of less. Today for lunch (and I was STARVING at around 10am, like I started feeling sick) and lunch was at 11:30...I almost couldnt finish one of the border bowls from taco bell.  after a little over half, i got full.  i felt STUFFED after eating the whole thing.  and a couple days ago, i was getting full after ONE regular taco.  i dunno.. what the fuck's up?"

"event","I had THE best dream ever last nite.  Too bad it was just a dream.  I think this would rank somewhere in my top 5 things I'd like to happen.  

I think it was a futuristic setting, and it was at night.  It might have been a nightclub, but we were outside.  And up on kind of a bridge, but not for cars, it was more like it bridged the gap between two buildings and was for people to walk on, and was like at least 30 stories up.  And we could see the city lights below.  It wasn't cold or windy or anything, it was just really really comfortable.  
I was with friends, but not current friends.  It was a mix of friends I haven't seen in a while or haven't hung out with in a while, mixed with friends who don't even exist in the real waking world, but in the dream they were familiar, they were friends, they were real.  On the far side of the bridge was a door, to get into the building (which like I said may have been a nightclub).  And the person who walked out...that memory will hopefully be forever with me.
It was Kristi.  Kristi Schwartzly.  I haven't seen her since beginning of senior year (so almost two years ago).  Man I miss her.  In my dream, it was such a happy moment.  We hugged, embraced, talked for a while...It would be nice to really see her.  I dunno....just to see that she's doing ok.  I still think of her...I wonder if she thinks of me.  \
Maybe this ""dream"" was one of those 'you dream it and then it later comes true' type things.  Well it WAS in the future, so I guess we'll see.

Today is my last day at work, until I get back from Cali.  I am most likely going to do nothing again, simply because I can get away with it, and I really don't like doing work.  I need to do a lot of things between after work and Friday morning.  

Random off-topic thing: Y'all should visit <url>http://www.loneshadow.com</url> and visit the forums.  

I hope I get my info from financial aid soon.  I need to pay by August 6th, and I'll be gone, so I wanted to pay before then, but I'm pretty sure I need to get the paperwork back on my Verification Packet first.  Damn. 

I feel like I'm falling.  Not physically....not really emotionally...I guess just in my head.  Like I'm losing my ability to hold back when I get mad, and I can't stop it.  I'm falling from self control, and I can't control it.  
Emotionally...It's hard to describe how I feel emotionally, but I'll do my best.  Imagine how the balls in a lottery are picked.  Its a big spinning container, and the balls are randomly sucked out.  Now lets say that container is...well, whatever contains my emotions.  And my emotions and moods are the balls.  Its pretty much random how I will feel at a given time.  And any minor actions have huge effects.  A minor action will have more pull on the appropriate ball to suck it out.  If that at all makes any sense....maybe I'm going crazy..who knows..."

<b><u>Here we go:</u></b>
- The past 2 days (monday was different because heartburn woke me up and screwed everything up) I have slept through my alarm.  Well, rather, I've woken up and hit my snooze twice like I usually do, but I don't remember waking up!  Also, in the morning (and once last night) I've had these weird dizzy/losing my balance feelings in my head, like my equilibrium to keep my balance was fucking up.  Wonder what it is.

- Rollerblading was fun yesterday.  I didn't say a bunch, but neither did Katie.  I forgot how rediculously cute she is.  She's a really pretty girl.  Younger than I would have thought, but I'm still gonna keep calling her.

- I really enjoy graphic design.  I'm not that good at it yet, and all I have to use is PhotoShop 5.  But I still think I have the creative skills to get pretty good.  Maybe someday it will turn into more than a hobby.  I made the picture at the top of the page, and it was based off a banner I made for myself on the DDRFreak.com forums.  If you want, you can go to http://www.realityfixed.netfirms.com/psyc_blue.jpg to take a look at it. 
- I've been at work for roughly an hour and a half and I still haven't done any work.  Hooray for slacking.

- I have a lot of new and cool ideas for the wizard that I run in Dave's DnD campaign.  It might take a while, but I think it will be worth it."

"event","I'm fricken tired this morning.  I even went to bed semi-early last nite, at 1030.  I really dont like work.  I'm probably going to have to find a different job after I'm done at Delta and move on to SVSU.  Maybe they have a co-op program.  

I feel kinda sick this morning.  Not really nautious-going-to-throw-up sick, but just sorta dizzy.  Maybe its cuz I didn't eat breakfast, except for an apple on the way to work.  No milk=no cereal=no breakfast.  So I didn't eat.

I'm going rollerblading with Katie Morin after work today.  She is this cute girl I met at Lauren's grad party.  She likes 311.  Heh...well, it should be fun anyways.  I like rollerblading.  

Now you all get to see how I am up and down.  Yesterday when I wrote in my journal I was kinda in a depressed mood.  Right now, I am just sort of neutral, but not in a bad mood for sure.  But that could change at any minute.  

<b><u>Another example of being conflicted:</u></b> I don't like working at my current job.  Con: I hate getting up so early for it.  Pro: 35 hours a week is good.  Con: I can't stay up very late.  Pro: The pay is good.  Options of leaving:  Pro: I could find a job that I like.  Con: Probably woulnd't be as good of pay.  Pro: I could probably work more enjoyable hours.  Con: They probably wouldn't work around my school schedule.  Con: Getting fired looks bad, and if I quit, I'd feel bad about abandoning the obligation I feel to the people I assist.  Plus the whole explaining why I quit to my family/friends...I don't think its worth my trouble. 

I just thought for a second.  Most of what we do - as in jobs - isn't to push neccessary things, isn't to push useful things...its to push money, whether directly or indirectly.  Let's take two random examples:

Cars: extras on cars are not there because their neccessary and not there because they help you drive.  They are there because people want them, and will be willing to pay for them.  I'll admit that some things, air bags for example, are there for safety reasons.  But all the stereo upgrade stuff for example and the lighting packs is all just for show.  People would be willing to pay for it, so therefore industry will continue to make it. 

Phones:  cell phones are getting more high tech, I saw on TV (the Tech channel I think) that they will soon have cameras on them so you can video conference on them with streaming video.  You can have the internet on a cell phone.  You can have email on a cell phone.  None of which is neccessary, but may make people want to shell out money more.  Case closed.  Cell phones <i>do</i> make life easier, but all the little extras aren't neccessary.  

I am still in my ""This world is shitty and it sucks and I hate many things about it"" attitude. 

Will put more in later."

"event","Whats depressing is there are so many things I'd like to do, but I won't do them because of not having the money or not being able to sacrifice the time away from the job, which brings money.

Like: I want to travel. Many places there are that I'd like to go.  USA is good, but I'd like to 'see the world beyond my front door', so to speak.

I read this thing about an experiment that was done on this guy.  He was placed in an underground house, with no clocks or tv or magazines or anything in which to judge time.  He had books, and food, and I'm assuming other forms of entertainment.  After about a week he naturally switched over to a 30 something hour day.  Apparently the body doesnt naturally function at a 24 hour day.  After the experiment was over, he was taken out of the house.  He thought he had been in there for a few weeks, and really he had been in there for a couple of months.  I'd like to try that, but like I said, no time and cant sacrifice the money I'd make.  goddamn...."

"event","Well its been Im guessing 2 weeks since my last update.  Here goes..

<b><u>Week 1:</u></b> Went to Canada with Dave and some of his friends from work.  That was a lot of fun, definitely something I want to do again.  Did a lot of things with the family during this week, I remember going tubing and being extremely sore afterwards...A lot of staying up extremely late to game...Much playing DDR...The fireworks were just awesome this year...

<b><u>Week 2:</u></b> Once again, lots of staying up late.  Friday was Audrey's party.  Ashleigh Decker was in town, and she was going, so since I hadn't seen her in a while, I offered to give here a ride there.  Well we both got drunk, and I soon lost all of my respect for her.  She was flirting big time with like all the guys there and was flashing herself everywhere.  Its hard to respect someone like that.  Being drunk also made me hate myself when I'm drunk (happens every time I drink).  I ended up driving home at like 3 am out of boredom/lack of enjoyment.  

<b><u>Reflections and feelings:</u></b> I think I am starting to be less of a people person.  I used to be really fine around people I didnt know, but lately thats been tough for me.  And talking in general besides to my good friends, I have a hard time talking about anything.  Conversations are short, meaningless, and without substance.  I wonder if that year or so of repressed feelings from Freshman/Sophmore year of HS are finally starting to surface...I realize that I repress alot especially when someone pisses me off...which is sometimes easy to do.

I've been feeling very insignificant, useless, and unnoticed lately.  When I get mad at someone, Ive just stopped saying anything, no use trying to explain how I would be right in the argument, it would just lead to more arguing, and I know how it would end, so why bother...thats repression for ya.  
I am sort of sad that I live in the world that I do.  There is so much thats not right with it, and will never be right, so long as we keep moving in the direction that we do.  We have hate, racism, sex offenders, abusers of their 'liberal' status, overly opinionated people, overly sensitive people.  Money rules all, money buys basically everything.  Money buys religion.  Show me a church without a collection plate, and then I'll believe that money doesn't buy religion.  Might sound kinda corny, but after watching the movie K-PAX, there are a lot of things I like about the beliefs shown in it.  No need for government, because people know right from wrong and dont abuse it. No one is corrupt, no one is greedy for power, money doesnt rule, sex is not something to be sold, and life not someting to be taken for granted.  In many ways, I hate the world...People are so obsessed with their jobs...like little ants mindlessly running around, chasing the dollar, trying to push more and more money through the system...what a pathetic life...

I feel insignificant that I can't change that, and that there is so much more beyond our Earth that no one will ever find out about, and that everything we do here on Earth all seems meaningless on a grand scale.  I feel insignificant because I think no one really notices me half of the time.  I could leave from a party and no one would notice.  The last two I left from no one did.  I am not all about saying goodbye to 25 people anyways.  Just another formality that we've grown so accustomed to that really has no bearing on anything.  If no one notices if I am gone or not, why bother to let them know?  

I think maybe I have been kind of depressed because its been quite some time since I have been with a girl.  I don't care what anyone says, I loved Emily....but that was a year ago.  Finding another girl has been everything but easy.  I won't just settle for some 'arm candy' either...some hot girl with half a brain...
Why are girls attracted to jerks, rebels, and bad guys? I see so many of those type of guys with girls, and me with none.  That makes me feel even worse.  Yes, please go out with me, cuz I'm a fucking idiot, and I'm a poser Abercrombie and Fitch wearing rich boy.  Ah....I gotta just love what the rituals of dating have come to.  

I can think of at least two times over the last two weeks where I just broke down to crying for no reason other than I felt depressed, helpless, useless, and hopeless.  And what sucks is if other times I felt like that, I had to repress yet again because I was with or around people and I didn't want to show it.  

Ive been really conflicted lately.  Example: I left my Aunt's Hawaiian Luao party to go to the DDR tourney (which I won).  It got done early, and I told my fam that I would be back to the party.  But I really wanted to stay and hang out with my friends more.  But I felt obligated to go the party and would have to explain why I wasn't there if I didn't.  Clearly, I would have had more fun with my friends.....such was my conflict.   I would have felt bad either way...

Theres not enough hours in the day to do what I want.

If it weren't for the money, I wouldn't be working at my current job.  Another such example of how money runs the world (way to bring up a good point dave, seriously).  I need money to do what I want.  My job brings good money, therefore I stay at my job.  I no longer feel like its a choice to come to this job anymore.  Not even an obligation, because with an obligation, you are still deciding whether or not to fufill the obligation or not.  Call it a ""I have to, otherwise I'll be temporarily out of money, get bitched at by my dad, have to explain why I quit, feel bad because I have an obligation to the people I support at work, it won't look as good on a resume, etc"".  Plus, I have been ground down into feeling bad if I sleep in past noon.  I feel bad even, cuz I wouldn't be getting anything done, even tho I wouldn't do anything if I got up earlier (besides a job) anyways...such is another example of my conflict...

I haven't really been happy lately...In case you couldn't tell...anyone other than a select one or two people, don't try and give me advice or cheer me up, cuz I can 100% guaratee it will a) not help; b)piss me off more; and c)make me bitch at you.  You know who you are if you are one of the two, MAYBE three people I am talking about.  

I don't know if my being not happy is consistent, because its kind of been up and down.  I'll be in a really good mood one minute, but then something can set me off and I can be really in a bad depressed mood like 10 minutes later.  I hope its not something bi-polar related...

I guess that's it for now.  I have enough $$$ for Cali, and after that I am saving up for my own computer.  Hopefully at the end of September I will get my raise and then I will get a cell phone.  

I despise getting up early."

"event","I think future posts will most likely be random thoughts.

<b><u>Onto random thought-ness.</u></b>
- I am still trying to form an opinion of Adam and Ryan (the new DnD guys).  Ryan I'm not sure about, he just seems like the kind of guy that I could get <b>real</b> sick of <b>real</b> fast.  He always has to be the center of attention and always has to try and say something funny.  Adam I am still forming an opinion of.
- Dnd: got 2 new (my first 2 AAMOF) pewters, and I'll have to start painting them soon.
- My sister's grad party is tomorow, that will be fun, and we get to see the results of our hard work being enjoyed: swimming pool, planning, getting the yard nice, the BBQed pig, just the whole Hawaiian luao (sp?) theme...fun times.
- I'm getting pretty hungry and its not lunch yet.  We get to go to the Panda House because one of the guys that works here is moving to Alabama to work for a different place, so this is like a Going-Away-Party/Lunch.  I like chinese food. 
- We got the dates for Cali officialized (is that a word?).  August 1 through August 11.  We're leaving the morning of the 1st, getting there the nite of the 2nd, staying until the 9th, leaving the morning of the 10th, and getting back the nite of the 11th.
- I really need to start dating.  The problem is is that I am not the smoothest guy in the world when it comes to confronting girls I don't know.  Once I know them, no problem....but the initial ""Hi, hows it going, I'm...."" is not my specialty.  Its easier for someone (that knows them and me) to introduce me, then it is for me to introduce myself to someone I don't know.
- I are 1337 mini-golfxor.  I took 1st, yet again.
- I have 2 really good friends.  Better than having 10 ok friends. 
- I'm really starting to enjoy PhotoShop graphic creation.  I hope I can get better at it and make some hella smooth stuff.  I got an idea for a banner right now, that is a take from The Price Is Right.  I got the idea when I stumbled upon a TPiR font. I want to take the logo, and change it to ""The Psyc Is Right"", yknow, cuz my name is Psycadelik19 (this is for the DDRFreak forums, btw). And then Id need to put in some other stuff...but thats a start.

um, i guess thats it for now. oh yeah, on the subject of TPiR, i found a kick ass website that has a bunch of highlight videos, like the closest showcase ever, the highest winnings on plinko (which, i think is $22,100), and a woman that won $10,000 on the game where you punch out holes on this ""board"" and Bob pulls out the slips, and you get $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000.  its really great, really captures the essence that is TPiR.  the music is ""magical"".  good times."

"event","I wonder how long I will keep doing this to myself.  Yknow.  Staying out late on work nites.  Me staying out can't justify sleeping in later, because thats using my own irresponsibility to justify being more irresposible.  Even tho I sacrifice sleep, I can't sacrifice work that I have an obligation to be at.  But it's worth it, I think.  Gaming is a lot of fun.  

Well its been almost a week since I last played DDR.  I will probably go tomorow and play some doubles.  After all, I don't wanna get 'out of practice' before the tournament ;)  .  

What else.

Oh yeah, I broke the lid to the glass cookie jar this morning.  I was already running behind due to waking up 15 minutes late.  I was checking the top cupboards for cereal since there was none in the lower ones, so I had to stand on the counter.  My hand bumped the spice rack (not really a spice rack as it is a rack that holds <b>three</b> containers of spices) and it fell down off the wall and onto the cookie jar.  The lid busted and the spices fell on the ground.  Two of the lids of the spices broke, and one of them was ground up cayanne pepper.  Luckily for me, I got it in my face and started sneezing like crazy.  That set me back another 15 minutes, so I ended up being late to work.  Good thing I don't have to punch in and the only thing my boss really cares about is that I'm there period.  

<b><u>Random thoughts:</u></b>
- I wish I weren't so lazy at work.
- There ought to be more hours in the day to compensate for my struggle to choose between fufilling a need for a lot of sleep and desire to stay out with friends.
- I think we are such an unhealthy population because we don't sell a majority of healthy things.  If we were just smart about the foods we market, staying healthy and eating right wouldn't be such a big deal.  But hey, are we really willing to sacrifice that kind of market (like exercise equipment, inflated prices on health food due to the laws of supply/demand, fast food chains, snack food lines, many many sit down restaraunt chains, etc, the list goes on and on)?  What's more important, in this capitalist society, health or money? Duh.
- My dad is a real ass sometimes.  ""Well I guess I'll be getting this party together by myself.""  He must have forgot that <u>anytime</u> he asked me to do something for it, that I was there to help out.  
- I bet the afterlife is a real nice place.  I sometimes try to imagine what it would be like.  I try to imagine a 'tears of joy' feeling coupled with an 'everything is so perfect and right' feeling, and magnify that by (insert large interger thats a power of 10 here).  
- I have two ideas of what the purpose/meaning of life are.  One of them involves ignoring the fact that we are more than just physical beings, worker ants that blindly run our lives trying to be happy in this world, merely a tool of procreation, and when we die, all of that is taken away and we are 'reborn' into a new body, to start the learning and journey over again in a whole new world.  The other one is to acknowledge that many things in this life don't really matter in the grand scheme of things, that we should live this life to the fullest, because before we know it, it will be taken away from us, and we will have a new world in which to explore, to learn, to enjoy.  In this theory, we should acknowledge that, while we <i>do</i> have better/different things ahead, we are still bound to this physical plane for a short time and we should contribute as best we can to its continuation, so that others can continue the cycle and follow in our path, but we should also not have regret.  My advice on regret for not doing things can be summed up in a sentence: ""What are you waiting for?"" If you always choose to not do things because you are (for example) saving it for something else or scared to do it, that will get you nothing. And before you know it, your chance to do it again in this world will be over.  So what are you waiting for?
- I am invincible, as long as I'm alive. 
- I just realized how much I have on my mind, if I type this much just kind of off my head.  

the end, for now. so.....to be continued?....hehe"

"event","wow man am <i>I</i> ever tired....

Last nite, we finished setting up the pool.  The filter is all in now, and i also didnt have to go help pour cement like i was going to, cuz my dad told me to stay home and mow grass instead.  

I have decided to try something, at least for a few days or a week, maybe longer, depending on how long i can go.  I am going to try to eat fat free/low fat foods and excersize more, trying to flatten out my ""padding"".  We'll see if i can stick to it...

Gamed last nite with Dave, Von, Ryan, and (other guys name, dont remember it).  The other guy and ryan are new, and it is entertaining to see how they do things, cuz it kinda reminds me of how i was back then (""um, what's AC again?""  XD).  But we were up until 3am, and they stayed up later.  I ended up getting probably about 3 and a half hours of sleep, so im pretty tired this morning.  But it was good to hang out with dave again, he doesnt seem as (for lack of a better word) glum as his journal enteries made him sound.  tomorow is his birthday, but i really dont know what i should get him.  i know he isnt expecting anything, and will probably give me the ""you didnt have to get me anything"" speech, but whatever.  anywho.

Yea, i realized how much i enjoy gaming last nite.  I dont know whether its the gaming itself or the being in a good atmosphere just hanging out with good friends or what, but i really enjoy it.  I dont know how anyone can consider it ""dorky"", i mean, take acting (non dorky thing), some dice (also, non dorky), add them together, and you basically have gaming.  so.......???? i give up... anyway, im done writing now, i think i could just keep typing random stuff in my half awake half asleep state, but im not going to, so ha! you'll just have to keep waiting in suspense for me to post again.

EDIT: oh yeah, i did all the math-u-lations, and i figured that cali <b><i>IS</i></b> still do-able, id just have to save reallly reallly good."

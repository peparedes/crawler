"event","Wouldn't it be nice if you could pick and choose what from your past affected you?  Take out all the things that screw up your life and leave the good stuff?  I don't care about all the 'you learn from it' bullshit people throw around.  Anything that takes your initial view point of the things around you and screws it in a negative way is not helping you.  How does an inability to trust help anyone?  Or what about an aversion to parties because of experiences?  Does that help anyone out?  

Don't think so."

"event","Reading does things to me.  It does things I really don't like.  I've been reading this stupid Cannery Row book since like 2:30 today and I'm only a little past half down.  I'm not really all that slow of a reader, its just that I can only read for so long before my brian screams for me to stop.  When I push past that wall of to much I get grumpy, annoyed, bored, anxious, frustrated, all things not good really.  This state takes all the things about me that are annoying and intensifies them like mad.  

I don't get to see Suzy's belly dancing tonight..that makes me sad.  

Tommorow is me and em's one year.  I really hope I'm in a better mood.  Love flows a lot less interupted when there isn't a sad face in the way.  And I do truely and deeply love her...

Ok I should get back to reading this stupid peice of trash book, I hate it."

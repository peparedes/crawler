"event","So!  Today I went to my Spanish class and there was a TEST!!!!!!  And I had NO idea!  And I had a semi-freak out moment until I noticed that it was on direct object pronouns, which happenen to be EXACTLY the same as in Italian!  I was soooooo excited and I (probably for now) learned my lesson about not studying.  How lucky am I?

So, just thought I would let you know how excited I am to know Italian!


Tienes la lista?  Si, la tengo.   Puedo leerlo.  Estoy haciendola.   Jajajajajajajaj.........

How is everyone, by the by?"

"event","Hi everyone!  I am so glad to see that people are still using livejournal!  Anyway, I'm going to try to write a little in English and a little in Italian because that way everyone gets to practice whatever language they are trying to learn! :)
My sister and her friend came the other week to visit.  My mom and I drove all the way to San Francisco and back to pick them up from the airport which was pretty exhausting but I was no way as tired as they were!  They slept the ENTIRE drive home which is understandable but also kind of a shame because the drive from SF to my house is really beautiful.  Anyway, I took them around to the Redwoods and the ocean.  We also got lucky one day and there was a baseball game that we went to.  They thought the baseball game was GREAT and totally American.  I think overall they had a good time.
I had ten thousand times more fun with my sister than I thought I was going to though!  She is really different when she is not with her mom or at work or whatever.  Her friend was really nice too; and she spoke some English!  I was so happy to see my sister brought someone with her who speaks English! I couldn't imagine my sister in LA alone with no English skills.  Ah!
At any rate, everything else has been going good.  Nothing too exciting has happened since I last wrote (which I guess is a good thing, no news is good news after all!)  Just school, work, family.  My betta fish did die though.  That was kind of dissapointing, but life goes on!  :)
Anyway, I hope everyone is doing good!  Vi voglio tanto tanto bene!  Ci sentiamo!

"event","Hey hey!  I know that in my last entry I promised to write soon.  But!  Life gets in the way so easily you know?

Anyway, I did want to check in and say hi to everyone!  I am doing good and still doing school.  Not much has changed.  My sister Elena (my SORELLA dovrei dire) and her friend are coming to visit me.  I am a little excited but mostly nervous.  Honestly I don't think she will really like my town but I guess in the end she is only going to stay with me for a couple of days.  Then her and her friend are going to tour California and sample our lovely public transportation system (which are even creepier than they are in Italy!).  It is just that she is very much a city girl and I live TOTALLY in the country!  Anyway, we shall see what happens!  

I hope that you all are doing great and if you ever have time to write me, please write!  I have free fast internet in my dorm so I check my mail often.  :)  Spero che ci sentaimo!  

Ciao!  Savannah  

P.S.  Oh!  I now have a fish!  Me and my roomate bought a beta a couple of weeks ago and I named him Luca.  He's super cute (and totally not allowed to be in my dorm).  :)"

Ciao a tutti!  I am back.  It has been a long time.

Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone know I AM still alive; just kind of stressed.  Semester finals are soon and so is thanksgiving (which means lots of time with the family and not enough studying).  

Since I work as well as go to school (I'm a barista.  It's not that interesting but the tips are nice :) I haven't been doing much other than that.  And it was really hard at first, getting back in the flow of things and actually having to study but now that I am adjusted I am trying to fit in other things that actually make life fun!  I still do west african dance every Monday, without fail, but last week I tried for the first time a tribal bellydancing class that I loved, so I am hoping to go back next week too.  

I also dyed my hair an exciting and DARING shade of blonde.  I know.  I am a prisoner of my own hair style.  

I will write again, soon.  And with better grammar. I do understand that since I am a native English speaker I should at least try to write good so you all can practice but AH!  You all know how to speak practically perfectly anyway.

I have been thinking about last year alot lately and I really can't wait to go back.  I know that it is probably unreasonable to ask my parents to pay for another ticket so soon, and it would be irresponsible to me to buy it myself; but it seems like the only things I remember about Italy now are the good things and that makes me want to go back soooo much!  I guess I have to remember to remind myself that half of the things I liked about my year there, I ended up enjoying because all of us were together doing it and that it wouldn't be the same if I went back alone.  

Anyway, just some thoughts.  

Comunque, vi voglio tanto tanto bene e vi penso ogni giorno.  Tanti tanti baci e abbracci!  -Savannah"

"event","Hello everyone!  I know it's been a while but I have been SO tied up!  School is way harder than I thought it was going to be and having a job at the same time have not really worked out in the way I imagined.  I am pretty tired and stressed out(Although I am almost positive I'm still not as occupied as James or Giada!)
I did get to do something fun last week though!  I went to an African Dance camp which was totally SWEET.  I only went for one day but two of my friends and I all drove out there together and after the three classes (uffa!) drove back.  It was amazing though and I LOVED all of the teachers who were there.  I have to say it's been the best thing I have done all summer. 
But now that summer is over I'm just trying to get back to the world of work and school which is proving really hard!  Why can't I just always have fun and be free?
Anyway, I was just checking in and saying hi.  I don't really have that much time to chat because I have a CRAP load of Sociology homework to do.  Baci baci pero, e vi voglio tanto bene!!!"

"event","Yay!  Sono tornata dal mondo di livejournal!  Too bad I don't really feel like writting in Italian! 
Soooo many things have happened that I don't even know where to start!  I went to Reggae on the River (a reggae festival) and had a TON of fun!  It was the most hippy experience I've had since I've been back and it was a good way to break back into things I guess. 
I guess everything has been going okay.  Ieri mancavo l'italia TANTO pero!  Mia mamma sta faccendo tante cose insieme ed e' molto impegnata e forse mancavo piu di tutto l'idea dalla famiglia che trovavo in italia.  Mi fa quasi ridere pero perche quando stavo la era una delle cose piu fastidiose per me!  A mangiare sempre con la famiglia! A non fare niente da sola perche devi stare con la famiglia!
Adesso mi sembro molto stupida perche lamentavo cosi tanto dalla mia famiglia in italia e adesso lamento delle stesse cose qui, ma solo perche la famiglia vera non le fanno!  Comunque, tutto sta andando benino, ma non BENE.
Io e mia mamma abbiamo fatto un ""benifit"" per un amico che ha cancro.  Era molto triste vederlo con tutta la famiglia ed a pensare che tra un po' forse non sia cosi.  Ma, era molto piu grande che abbiamo previsto ed era un grade successo.
My friend is going to have a bit party this weekend and I am pretty excited though.  I really really want a boyfriend and it is really hard without some kind of social function like that.  And I know that sounds really sad and weak and not very femminist; but it's true.  I don't feel like I need  a guy to validate me or any of that crap.  I just want someone to take me out places and shit.  I love my girlfriends but sometimes I just want to hang out with a guy. (Uh, especially after any kind of remotely romantic movie.  I watched Harry Potter the other day and got all whistfull...)
Uffa!  Comunque, solo volevo dirvi che tutto bene ( o quasi bene, non sto malata o niente cosi...). Penso che ci sentiamo piu spesso adesso.  Vi voglio tanto bene e tanti baci a tutti!  XOXOXO"

"event","I am back!  

I know I should probably be writting in Italian but I am soooo tired right now and, frankly, I'm not quite sure if I am even physically able.  

The trip with my parents went...okay.  Nothing really bad happened but I could tell that in the last year alot has changed between us.  Or maybe between us isn't really the best way to put it.  Pretty much, I have changed and they haven't; and they aren't getting the fact that I have.  

Everything that used to kind of bug me, everything that I just kind of put up with before is just glaring out at me now and I just can't seem to ignore all those little things that piss me off anymore.  My mother tells me what to do all the time, she is a total control freak, passive aggressive ect.  My dad is so spacy I can't even handle it and my real brother seems even lazier than my Italian one. 

I don't know.  It was nice that they came to pick me up and stuff but god it took alot of patience to deal with them for 2 weeks!  Plus, they wouldn't talk to ANYONE so I had to do all of the communicating.  My mom wouldn't even order her own coffee she was so scared!  I am SO sorry but how does she think we managed the first couple of weeks in?  It's not like we had our own personal translators by our sides!  

But all of this family stuff are issues for another day....  Right now I just wanted to check in and let you all know that I am relatively good.  I spent the day with one of my best friends (who also did a year in Brazil) and it went well.  But she is the kind of friend who I know will always be my friend.  It is going to be a little more interesting when I see everyone else.  Everyone else with whom my friendship was maily built off of common book, movie taste ect.  

Anyway, I miss you all alot and I thank everyday that there are computers in the world so that we can have such instant communication!  I'll try to write again tomorrow, and in Italian!  I love you all soooo much!  Night night!  Baci baci"

"event","So, my parents are here.  And it is suprisingly not weird. 

And, dude, if my genitori hadda been this nice to me all year, there SO wouldn't have been any problems! 
It's just that now I feel really weird about the whole thing.  I mean, with my parents it is all fine I just feel kind of trapped with them.  Like I really want to spend all the time I can with my friends but I feel obligated to be here with my family.  
I don't know how it will be when I see everyone at the train station.  I can't believe it's really over!  I mean, I know we will all keep in touch and stuff and that as far as that goes I don't have anything to worry about but still.  It will never be exactly the same!  I can never go over to Giada's house again and make a dolce and then watch Buffy!  I will never be able to run over to visit Milija again during the 5 second break we had between classes at school.  I mean, I know that we have all had an amazing experience here and that will always keep us somewhat together; but it wont be THE SAME.  
And what the fuck!  I just get around to liking Italy and now I have to leave?  My parents finally start letting my do shit and now I'm going home again?  It seems like just yesterday I had to do all that heart wrenching goodbyes and now I have to do it again!  
I am just too emotional of a person, I am too sentimental and let that kind of stuff affect me too much.  And it's something I hate about myself too! That I can't just say goodbye and be happy to have met everyone and leave it at that.  I just leave myself too open and these kinds of things hurt too much.  
I do have faith though that we will hear from each other again.  Even if it's 10 years down the road and I have come back to Velletri to visit my family and I call up Antonella to see how she is and Giada just happens to be there at the same time!  Or even if I'm hanging out at one of the summer festivals in California and I see someone with strikingly red hair and it turns out to a 30 year old Milija, you know?  Mi faresse tanto tanto piacere. 
I had this friend I met in middle school, he was a really nice guy but we did have the opportunity to hang out much.  We only went to school together for a year before high school started and he took off.  I don't really know what happened to him but I saw him again, like, 4 years later.  He recognized me first off (because I look exactly the same as I did since forever) and he calls me over.  At first I didn't even know who he was he looked so different but when I finally figured it out I was sooooo happy to see him!  And so we chatted for a couple of minutes before he had to go; how are you, what's up ecc.  And, just to know that he was doing good, and that he liked what he was doing with his life just made me so happy.  And I thought about it all day, and the day after, and the one after that!  
I think with real friends that is maybe enough.  Certo che se sento ogni giorno dei amici, ammazza come starei contenta!  Ma forse con i amici veri, basta che posso andare avanti con la vita sapendo che con voi tutto va bene.  Insomma, che state bene mi fa piacere."

It was cool to go through eveything.  Especially when I tried on my old jeans from California and they fit.    !    Which means I must have actually lost weight because post Christmas I def. couldn't even put them on...  Yay!

"event","I did salsa today.  It went OKAY.  However, before I retell the events of the day read this: 

Your Thursday Horoscope Savannah!
A sexy stranger may make this a day to remember, but you are better off limiting conversation to superficial topics. Too much transparency can be a bad thing early on, so avoid confessions or boasting.

I get my horoscope emailed to me everyday (http://astrology.keen.com/horoscopes/horoscopes.asp).  I don't get it together to check it everyday but sometimes I read it.  Like today!  Which is weird considering the following:

So, I arrive early (come sempre) just in time to incastrarmi* in an the award winning Akward Moment of the Day.  So, Momo(the teacher) asks me all these normal questions about how my weekend went ecc, and I answer, and we end up chatting; in a VERY normal kind of way. 

But you didn't really think it ended there did you?  I didn't think so!

So!  We're talking and he holds out his hand, like he does when you go and dance with him.  So I take it thinking that's what was going to happen.  But no!  So he pulls me close to him and THEN!....Pats me, ON THE HEAD. What what what what what? 

And I tried really really hard not to laugh.  And switched the convo topic to the specifics of a dance move.

Other than the head petting incident, the dancing part went okay.  I only fucked up twice.   Which I hope TO GOD wont happen tomorrow.  

I'm now off to bed.  I am way to tired to think of anything else  witty to say.  Ciao ciao!!!         

  
   


*Oh, at first I wrote that I was incazzata instead, which also has a certain sense to it."

"event","Ah.....sto a casa.  Da sola. 

I want to go to the movies with everyone but I have to stay here to eat dinner with my family who may or may not show up.  Blaaaahhhhh.....

I would really appreciate if just my sister and my brother came home to eat.  That would be nice.  My mom isn't feeling really perky today and already dissed on my Italian at least 5 times this morning when I went out of MY WAY to help her make the gelato.

Ug!  I really want to go to the movies!  I guess I'm just going to have to let that go and think that at least domani mattina I have something to do with my friends.  I WILL BUY A PAIR OF BLACK PANTS!!!  Black parachute capri pants!  Giada and I are going to the market thingy and then to SALSA.  It will be my last salsa class, which makes me sad.  I really liked it and it gave me something to look forward to during the week.  Not to mention it is practically the ONLY physical activity I get.  

Oh my god my parents are coming next next monday!  That really freaks me out because when they come my year here IS OVER!!!  I can't handle it.  Vanessa wrote me an email and it was so good to hear from her (she says hi to everyone!) but at the same time it was really sad.  She says that everything is going good at home and that there was no re-entry weirdness like AFS talked about; which is really really good, for her.  I don't know! I guess, even though it would be easier, I'm really not looking forward to everything going back to the way it was before I left.  Hey!  I spent a year in Italy!  I guess I just want something to show for it...

Okay, on to another less depressing topic though!  Does anyone know Pharrel Williams?  Because, since I am sitting at home alone watching DeeJay TV and he has to be the fucking cutest guy ever.  He's like a cute little kid...who, incidentally, also wrote that song that was in About A Boy, ""shake ya ass.""  

Oh god.  I just looked him up on IMDB (which is the best website ever, in case you don't know) and he is a musical genious!  Okay, maybe not GENIOUS, becuase frankly that Milkshake song isn't really that clever but still!  There are like over 22 movies for which he wrote songs for (ah! Bad grammar!)  

Anyway, gotta go because La Mamma just called and said I have to catch to bus because we're eating at my nonna's tonight.  Che palle.  She's a good cook and all of that but ug.  I hate the bus."

"event","Okay!  After yesterday's weridness today has gone suprisingly as planned.  Except for the 2+ hour interrogation I did in Italian!  Why!?!?!  It's the penultimate day!  Why!?!?  

We actually ended up talking more than anything, which was cool, but it's still stressful to talk one-on-one like that with your Italian teacher (especially when he corrects you every 5 seconds. I know I'm suppose to be LEARNING but he interrupts my groove). 

La Mamma comes home at 8.  I am going to die.  I don't have a ride home and I have to just bite the bullet and tell her I'm going to spend the night at Miljia's.  I hate it that I've been thinking about this all day and that she makes me so nervous.  I am more stressed out about talking to her than I am about talking to Momo again (which actually wont be so much stressful as akward, but it's still a good parallel). 

I hate it that she has this control over me and that I just become so uncharacteristically weak in front of her.  I must stand up for myself.  Forza Savannah!!!

I have to stay positive.  Even if I am almost 100% sure she is going to tell me no and give me the ""what do you think this is? A family or a hotel?"" speech again.  It's just that I don't think I can handle getting all excited about going out and doing something and then have her come home and squash my good humour with a giant guilt trip.  Ug!  

And!  If I fuck up in my diplomacy I fuck the whole weekend over and I wont be able to go to Vanessa's dinner!  

Fuck!!!


Hahaha...we seem to have found ourselves a theme...."

"event","Yay!  The last day of school!   ....until monday.  

I remembered to go to salsa today.  Ha. 

As you can see I'm in kind of a pesimistic mood.  Which is good because today the teacher took the time to individually criticize us. Oh, god.  He said that I am mentally blocked and that I know the passes but I am phycologically not into it or something.  Ah! 

Yeah!  It's easy for him to say that!  Mr. I've-been-dancing-since-I-was-born!  AGR!  He makes me more frusterated that any other person ever!  And he picks on me!  I have to do every move perfectly but he lets Giada off so easily!  I'm SO sorry but she is so completely uncoordinated!

That was actually really mean and now I feel bad about writing it.  I really love her and she is really technically good; I'm just feeling bitter and need a scapegoat.  

At least one cool thing happened today.  I cut my brother's hair; which is something I've never done before.  He taught me how to use the buzzer (which is actually really easy) but I was super scared I would cut him so it took me a million years to finish.  He's so hairy though I didn't know where his head hair stopped and his back hair began.  That's the grossest thing ever. Ew.  Che schiffo. If it's one thing I hate though it's back hair.

It was cool to use the buzzer thing though.  We have one at my house in California but I was always too scared to use it.  I don't know who's head I would buzz though.  Who knows.  Maybe I'll bring it to the next party I go to.  Shame on who ever falls asleep first!  :)

I talked to Juls (my step mom Julia) today and I am soooo excited for her to come!!!  They are just so different from this family here I am sort of worried about how they will mesh though.  Like, we are a very touchy family; we hug, for example.  But my Italian family DEFINATELY doesn't do that!  In the whole year I've been here I've never even SEEN anyone in my family hug each other.  And my family smiles and laughs!  These people are so serious (something that has rubbed off on me alot.  Which I hate.)    

Anyway, I just hope that everything goes okay. Juls is already determined to hate my Italian mother and my Italian mom, I can tell right now is NOT going to like my family.  We're way to multicultural leftist for her.  

I can't believe I have spent a whole year here in a family of 4 where I can only stand one of them.  Thank god for my sister."

"event","oh my god it is summer and I don't have a soccer tan!  It's a MIRACLE!!!
For those of you sad sad readers who have not experienced the total sexiness of the soccer tan in summer I will now explain.  Shins white as snow, knees of an African, followed, once again, blindingly white upper thighs.  Yay for shin gaurds! 
The best is when you go to the beach and the stipe of tan is so clearly exposed; left out in the open without the protection of soccer socks to protect it from the obvious glances of passers-by who are surely thinking ""I hope that girl is a soccer player because if she's not...she just has no excuse for that tan line.""
A little off topic there, sorry.  Anyway, the point is I DON'T have a soccer tan; I have a bathing siut RED.  I have never been so burt in my life and I am definately going to die of skin cancer now.  I just seem to forget that I am FUCKING BLONDE and just can't keep up with Italians in the tanning department. When I got home I went stright to the bathroom and took a cold shower. 
On the brightside though, I don't think I'm going to school tomorrow.
Today was suuuuuch a nice day outside it made me really really really sad  not to be home though!  I just wanted so much to call up Corinna (my amiga/vicina) and go drive into town to buy ice cream with the windows down, blasting reggae through the redwoods, wearing our flip-flops!  I'm actually listening to her reggae mix now.  I had a really good time at the beach, and Giada's friends who I went with are so nice; but there is something completely unreplacable about home and the friends you've had  (practically) since you were born.  Not to say that my AFS buddies aren't awesome!  I am actually really amazed at how close I feel to all of you/them after such a short time.  Can you believe that only 8 months ago we had no idea who each other were? Weird!

Uffa, gotta go.  I have to saqua the salad.  Rinse!  I have to rinse the salad.  Or wash the salad?  You rinse out fabric and fruit, do you rinse out vegtables?       
Miljia!  Help me!"

"event","So!  My brother is still limping around the house.  God, if I didn't think he was pathetically lazy before, I definately do now.  He can't go to work in the morning because...uffa...it's just too hard on him.  But, you know, going out partying with his friends is another thing entirely.  Anyway!  I can't beleive we are almost finished with school!  I am really trying not to freak out about the whole going home thing.  Actually it's not the going home that is terrifying it's the whole picking a college.  Ai!  
And I still haven't finished that Narnia book.  It just wont end!!!  And, is it just me, or is it the hugest religious metaphor ever?
I just finished talking to Cheska.  I can't believe we are actually going to get together.  All of that ambiguity about what I was planing for the weekend and dodging her phone calls for nothing!  At least my concious will be pleased with me.  It'll be like doing carity work or something.  Baci, Savannah"

"event","Hey!  I can't believe I am actually writing two days IN A ROW.  Considering I can't get it together to even fake my own giustificazion (which I can't spell!).  However, nothing that interesting happened today and I am once again stuck with nothing to say.  The most exciting part of my day was helping my brother saran wrap his leg before he could take a shower.  Actually, come to think of it that was pretty funny.  We used two garbage bags, saran wrap AND scotch tape."

"event","So!  This is my first entry!  I am excited.  As someone practically retarded when it comes to computers I am pretty proud of getting it together to write an online journal.  (thank you Milija!)
I actually don't have anything to say right now.  I'm in a super ranty mood and just wrote and totally pathetic cry-y email to my mom (which I know AFS doesn't like you to do...) but I don't really feel like getting all emotional again.  Anywho!  I hope I get it together to write tomorrow, so! Until then!  Ciao!  
P.S. Forse la prossima volta provo in italiano.  Hahaha.... che scerzo! 

P.P.S Is ticked off hyphenated?"

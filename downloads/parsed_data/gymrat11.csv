""your touch is ever lasting"", you leave your mark on me 100 times a day, in thought, your voice on the phone, the text messages, and then you call me after your super super rare night of drinking and tell me your sister is gone, and you want me to come over.  how can i respond?  i know if i came over there id only jeporadize US...i dont want to do that...i dont want you to fade out of my life like soo many have.  but you tell me that you want to come snuggle with me...so i start to think of the moments weve had while snuggling and how good you feel in my arms, how well you fit me...i close my eyes and see all this, and the smell of your skin comes back to my mind and i smile, i see this, i feel this, i cant handle it.  so i try to keep away, i want to see you soo badly, just us, in private, laughing like we do, being silly, kinky....NO, its not right.  you told me so.  its not right for you now.  you want a friend, someone who will be there, but the signs are that you want your cake and eat it to.  i just dont want to make a mistake and ruin something special, something that could last a lifetime and beyond...im soo happy for you...youre doing soo well, youre making something of yourself and i want to see you go far in life.
even now im thinking of you...still...after all this...and i know you are there thinking of me too...cuz you wouldnt call me and leave me messages or make time for me...do everything you said you wouldnt but do. ahh, well, at least ill see you monday night, youll come down to the restraunt and finally meet the guys, and theyll meet the girl ive been running around with...yet were ""not attached"".  and then come home, relax, and go with what we do."

everytime i look into your eyes i melt, completely, and become your puppet...this is after a year of knowing you...friends to start, and then just exploding into this....our primal instincts taking over as we pleasure one another.  where could this all lead?  i dont want to get hurt again, i cant, im running out of hope...out of the feeling that it takes to do what i do...to be that ""sweetest guy ever"", those moments, those heartbeats are beginning to dwindle.  ive put soo much on the table for too many people and now i want to...just for once, be appreciated for it.  and i know you have it in you, and youve shown it...i just hope one day you see, that this guy, this man who cherrishes the moments he spends with you...is standing there, waiting for you to take my hand and walk side by side."

i was fooling myself into thinking it would,
fooling myself into thinking i could fit in,
fooling myself into thinking you would let me,
fooling myself into following my heart again,
you are different and thats why i took the chance,
you arent like the rest,
focused and determined to make it all work,
to make your career work,
to make your life work.
i said id be the silent non-attention needing one,
but your mind is made up,
you are willing to see where things go, 
and thats all i ask,
and thats all i could ever want.
you dont want this to be us,
thats what i said from day one,
this is not what i want us to become,
we enjoy it, 
but we know there is more,
you said your feelings are there,
as are mine,
but its that moment when my heart skips a beat,
when you touch me,
and i feel like i havent felt in years.
you make me a better person,
and i cant say that about alot of people,
you make me want to be better than what i am,
and that i admire you for,
you make me watch what i say,
and for that im greatful,
you make me smile when i see you,
that alone brightens the darkest day.
holding you feels so right,
kissing you feels so good,
laughing with you makes me calm,
talking with you makes me happy.

so maybe in my bed tonight we said our final words...i doubt it.  we did though tell each other how we feel, where we stand, and what to expect...im a hopeless romantic, i told you so...ill never stop either, and you are too...so for now, ill just take this day by day, see where it takes us...see where it takes you, where it takes me."

so today i had to drop out of school so i can go in for surgery in a few weeks and get my next health issue taken care of...the cyst.  ill be laid up in bed for a few weeks, and the teachers arent going with it, and there is no way else around it, so i had to drop my classes.  no fun, but right now, i need my body to get fixed up...i know it sounds bad, but like, im young only once, might as well take advantage of the healing powers then.
i have been working at my uncles restraunt now for a few weeks, its been going alright, but hes selling the place cuz the bitch of a neighbor next door is killing business, and shes only happy when were miserable.  and to top it off shes a jesus freak, and uses religion as her fucking weapon, and that pisses me off...we are at war now because of religion...and many wars before have had a religious undetone...why?  and now this fucking bible thumping bitch is attacking the foundation of our morality and family...i just want to put her in a pod and have her shot into space.  or killed, but thats not like me...so thats just something i have to pray for. :/  
ive been at the gym though, working hard, lost 50lbs so far and everyone is noticing, which makes it easier to get myself back in there...because the hard work is paying off, and eventually ill be back to where i wanna be, and hopefully able to try out for a few teams in the spring...but well see. right now its just gettin back into shape, and getting my knee rehabbed and back to 95% plus. 
anywho, for now, im done, this wasnt that good, but then again, im lost for some reason, got alot to say but no way to say it, and i dont know what to do."

so then i get home..its 1030, and my sister calls, crying...well trying to cover it up.  asking if anyone is at the house with me, and telling me shes not sure if she should drive back home or not tonight...all the way to SD.  im like hell no, come over here and chill. lets talk.  so she comes over and were talking..and shes crying cuz her bf starts the fire academy tomorrow morning..and im like soo...you act like you dont care..and youre all bitchy and what not...and yet youre crying over this.  what the fuck is it with you women and youre damn head games?  you fucking say you dont care, but you do, and then you cry over something?  make up your damn minds.  i told her to ""dump him"" and so far...unsuccessful.
im in the process of getting all my sports stuff in order.  finding my old baseball and football jerseys, and getting all the plaques and such organized...cuz ive decided to make like a sports hall in the new house..my sisters and i life athletic achievements...so i am getting my old college jersey, the one from my JC, and im trying to locate the high school one, which i think becca has, yet, i cant seem to get ahold of her...ever. and thats something ive become accustomed to.  
but for now, im off to bed, have to get up in 6 hours to hit the gym...had my one day off after the last 13 were on.  i dont plan on taking too many more off anymore as well. mentally focused now, and i see and understand where i wanna go and what i need to do to get there.  see me in a month im a different man, see me in a year and im a different person."

its all coming back now though...the little things i do now are helping me acheive my goals...hell..ive lost 30 lbs already...another 50 to go and ill be sub 200 again.  this time last year i had a 6 pack going, and all my muscles...and like i felt invincible.  but maybe this last year has been the lesson i need in life.  i can work so hard for something. get to somewhere where i want to be, and then in a matter of a few months it can all go away.  but its that look in the eye i have to get back.  that look that says, ""go ahead, knock me down...and just watch how fast i get back up!""  its that fire inside that im trying to rekindle. i mean i have 9 months till the next combines start. 9 months to make it back to where i want to be.  9 months to prove to MYSELF...because thats all that matters...that i can do this.  i will.  ill continue to give myself these self guided pep talks till then.  since no one else but me can make that final choice to be better than what i am today."

  ""He looked at the change in his hand, it as eclectic as the city he lived in. New ones and old ones, scattered throughout, and all with their own story.  It wasn't because today was his first day, it's just that today wasn't like every other day, and that brought an optimestic feel to it.""

im not sure what the story is going to be about...but its going to kinda write itself...well see, not sure...got ideas.  more time will be spent thinking about it. for now, i have to get back to my lunch guests."

"event","im numb right now...numb in the brain.  cant think of anything...anyone...any reason why im writing.  just am. pouring meaningless nothingness onto this pseudo-paper journal i keep.  i started on here for a reason.  here meaning this ""livejournal.com"" place because of a girl....but kept going because it was a release.  the only consistent release ive had for the last 3 plus years.  the girl is gone...more than likely forever...i messed that one up.  but this is still here...for how much longer i dont know.  but for the mean time i take full advantage of it.  i know i skip days...frankly cause some days...getting to this computer...sitting down and spilling out my life...just doesnt seem right.  i complain to much on here...and really...im not a whiner...and shit...i complain about complaining on here way to much.  really should look into that one.  i guess i didnt start on here solely because of the girl...but it was a good part about it.  it was a medium in which i could tell her what was going on inside my mind...describe to her the things that probablty wouldnt have ever come up in conversation...because they just dont come to mind all the time...and when they do...you dont know how...or if you should ask them at all.  

ive covered many aspects of my persona on here...the good, the bad and the ugly...i guess you could get a good idea of who i am reading my past journals...probably figure me out.  my friends used to read them all the time.  they enjoyed them...comic relief for them i guess...but i know some did it because they are true friends...and want to know what im saying..when for that short period of time in the day im not talking.  some parts of my entries scream out though...yell for something...someone to grab ahold of me...give me some kind of direction and just kick me in the ass to keep me going when i get lazy and want to slack.  other parts show my vulnerability to the world...that im really not this big rock...that im really a small pebble with a really big shadow cast from just the right amount of light...at the right angle.  but then it does show my strength...and my willingness to be weak makes me strong...stronger than most...because i admit to it...and cherish it.  my melancholiness is self imposed more times than not...its my perfection i seek that breaks me down...should be lighter about myself to myself...accept my flaws...and make do with what i have.  

although i want to continue on...i must sleep."

"event","so megan and i were going to have dinner tonight...since im the best cook in town and didnt feel like going out to dinner...figured id make up something to eat before going to see Napolean Dynamite.  well, that didnt happen.  
being this was the 2nd time weve hung out since we met shortly before i left for school in august last year, the first being earlier this week at willys house,  figured wed sit and chat and just get to know each other better...feel each other out...see if persuing friends is what we want...or if there is more.  
so i went to pacific ranch market around 4 today...got the goods i needed in order to make my experimental tequila cheesecake w/a pretzel crust(all from scratch)...some chicken, pasta, tomatoes, and assorted herbs to add to my bomb sauce i make...along with wine, because whats a nice dinner without a little wine.  
so i get home..and like my mom gives me a lecture about the food i bought...because i use only free range chicken...and thats kinda expensive...$7.00 a lb.  but like its better for you...its bigger..and just tastes better.  so i started into my prepping of the cheese cake...cause like it took an hour to bake...and figure id get dinner served and done...we go to the movie...and then back for dessert.  well, megan had something come up...so no movie...but still came for dinner.  anywho...dinner turend out great...everyone was like josh, that was amazing..(brushing off my shoulders thinking::""if ya know your a pimp go ahead and brush your shoulders off"":::as i popped my collar).  we waited about another hour and a half for the cheese cake to set...trying to wait as long as possible to eat it...cuz it needs atleat 4 hours to set...and i knew i wasnt going to be able to wait that long with all the hints everyone was dropping about how good it looked.  so like after 3 hours...took out the cheesecake and served it.....huge success.  megan though couldnt stay around for it...so i made her a mini one, and shell get to have it tomorrow when we get together.
so ya, my date got crashed...but she got to meet my mom and my sister...and they got to meet her.  so really its all good...but for a 2nd date kinda thing...i dunno...lil akward.  but my sister was like ""wow, she is like a freaking barbie doll...perfect teeth, hair, body...""  i laughed, and was like nicole...shes also got a personality, ambition, and intellect...and to me, thats what matters and all the other stuff is a bonus."

"event","well just when i thought it couldnt happen...ya know...like maybe all the injuries one can sustain while playing bball had passed over me...nope...had to go to the ER again...last time i went its because i almost bit off half of my tounge...10 stitches...and a week later...tounge healed...well now...lets see...did a head fake on a fast break...and got the guy in the air like i wanted...but all be damned if his lil ass elbow didnt catch me square in the head...right on my left eyebrow...and all be damned if that lil elbow did come from a guy that probably is 5'5 130lbs...and a junior in hs...now it wasnt his fault..and im not mad at him..its the nature of the game...in the gym...anything can happen...just gotta watch your shit...so his elbow got me...GOOD...cracked open the whole eyebrow...about a 2 inch gash...pretty freggin cool if i dont say myself...but damn...i was gushing blood like spicket...it didnt really hurt that bad...but i looked all gnarly walking with this braveheart-ness feel about myself...none the less i was stitched up about 45 mins later...and then went out for the night. went to willys after that...he had a bbq and i told him id do my beer n onions bath to soak the brauts in after we cooked them(they went over really well)...ive trying to hang with him as much as possible before he ships off to fort knox for his tank commander training...and then moving on to iraq in january to meet up with his division which is there right now.  he has some friends in from austria...cool guys...alex...harry...christen.  harry is part of some very ultra conservative political group back in austria...its like a fraternity...except they have the craziest initation...sword fight.  yeah...freggin sharp ass swords in which you duel off with fellow members...now they have on a steal mesh coat to protect from getting stuck too bad as well as this like neck thing...kinda like what you wear when you get whip lash...but only you cant cut through it with a sword.  and then these shatter proof goggles...and then you fight...well he got a hit to the head...and he showed me the pictures from when it was done...holy cow...covered in blood...his own...from a sword fight.  he told me that the really good guys dont get cut...to which i replied...so youre telling me you cant handle your sword.  he laughed...but i was like...wow.  thats an insane right of passage into manhood...but then again...i respect him greatly because of it...sticking to tradition...and man enough to take on the task...knowing he could get really hurt. 
 meghan decided to join us to last night...and the guys were like...uhh wow...i kinda laughed...and was like welcome to california guys...they had these expressions on their faces...like theyd never seen a hott woman before...i kinda forgot how good looking she was since it had been a long time since we talked or seen one another. but well see...we both have vacancies in that dept...if not...shes a great person...whod make an amazing friend.

other than that...i currently have a job offer pending in San Diego..doing what i do best...coaching...its actually a 2 part job offer...one part is the special teams coach at poway high school...and the other would be as the special teams coordinator for a nation wide football consulting firm...which has been around for about 35 years...and puts on camps for pro, college, and high schools.  so im looking foward to see what that brings around for me...it would be nice if i can swing that...nicole and i can maybe live together...that way when brian leaves its just me and my sister hanging out living together."

last night didnt help much though...started playing catch phrase at like 8pm..which is like taboo in a way...except you describe the word to your team and then when they guess it you pass it on to the other team and whoever has it when the buzzer goes off has to take a shot.  ya my alchy friends thought to do that...so i played..and we won alot..and yet i still had 14 shots of capt morgan spiced rum and then like 5 of segrums 7...and like 8 or 9 beers...but i remember last night...didnt have a hangover...and im still asking myself why i did that. everyone was shocked to see me dtinking...they were like everybody...this is an extremely rare occasion that this guy drinks....hell i hadnt been drunk since my 21st b day.  but im happy though that at least i didnt make any phone calls...because when i do that...i make serious mistakes.  so matt and i were up till like 230 playing catch phrase after everyone left...just drinking beers and then threw in MIRACLE and passed out.
anyways...ya...i should go now...get some dinner and make some calls for the night."

"event","could i possible dig anymore?  ive been digging into myself forever it seems. what have i found?  what has all this ""soul-searching"" brought me to realize...well heres some of them...cuz i know there is more, yet i havent thought of all of them yet:(and by soul searching im talking everything in life i come across or feel)

1.  i am where i am today because of the actions ive carried out on my own...not because of someone else.
2.  i eat when i get down...hence the 60lbs ive gained since august.
3.  i will always battle a weight issue...unless i get that GI surgery that makes my stomach an acorn...that might help
4.  i wish i had a normal family...dad, mom, sis, maybe even an extra bro in there...like your total sitcom family where the parents are cool, but still rule the coupe with a firm hand
5.  i care more about other people than i do myself
6.  i dont like it when i get jerked around
7.  im every girls bestfriend, yet im seen as unopposing to them and thus...unattractive.
8.  my friends are more vital to my existence than my family...
9.  i still miss becca
10. i still miss chris
11. my sister will end up doing better in life than i will
12. i will never probably play in the NFL
13. i cant stand the sound of my mom eating(her jaw makes this crack and pop sound and it just drives me up the wall)
14. i have more friends than i can shake a whole forest of sticks at...yet only a handful i can count on
15. i am too nice in general...people walk on me
16. when i first meet a girl, i seem to come off as desperate, when really, its just my eagerness to learn about them and my outgoingness to invite them everywhere...which people out here arent used to someone being a straing shooter
17. i cant read more than 50 pages before i lose my concentration
18. although today might have been a bad day, tomorrow always brings hope of being better
19. at times i can be just like every other guy...from experience ive been there...but now things are different...back to the way they used to be...
20. im a sucker for a girl who can make me laugh and be just as dumb as me sometimes 
21. i know what its like to live in poverty and im completely changed because of my experiences
22. i will soon enough graduate from college with a degree
23. i hate the cold
24. fake boobs arent really all that good
25. i will now cut anyone out of my life who does not feel as if they want to be a part...i simply have too many people that i try and fit into my life to deal with those who wanna fucking drag me through this and that
26. fate and free will are both true concepts
27.  although religion is not something i fear...right now it is not something i fully embrace, yet part of me is beginning to lean that way
28.  i want 4 kids instead of 7
29.  my little cousins blake and mason kick ass
30.  i am deeply hurt that i pissed off my grandparents
31.  i dont want my grandfather to die upset at me
32.  even if i make a list of things to do...i still have a hard time getting them done
33.  i know pain now more than ever...whether its physical, emotional, or psychological...i know what its like to hurt
34.  i really dont have a firm grasp on politics or even where i stand completely...and thats quit sad considering im 22...male, and come from an affluent family.
35.  i need a good job...with good pay, and flexible hours....damn...sound like everyone else there
36.  a blown out knee hurts worse than anything else ive ever done...would have been nice to break something instead of tearing a ligament
37.  i get lost sometimes in thought because i think to much and too fast.
38.  i am better at scrabble than anyone else i know...thats a sad thing to proclaim...i know
39.  i really dont care what people think of me...but when someone doesnt like me...i want to know why..and feel offended
40.  georgia is really where i want to live...but being that im homeless...might work out well.
41.  love is just a four letter word thats not meant for me to use
42.  after 10 years of battling the pleas to try fish..im finally eating it...and its good...mmmm mahi mahi
43.  my grandparents are the richest people i know...yet youd never guess it
44.  ive seen the sun rise more than 100 times in my life before ive gone to bed.
45.  if i couldnt dance...id be a DJ
46.  ill never completely finish my song on the piano...
47.........TO BE CONTINUED......

"event","maybe for once i could not be so pissed at my family.  maybe i could just let all the things that have been said, and all the things that have been done...just pass...like water under the bridge.
but nope, not so far this week...
sunday morning i awoke to open my cell phone, only to have the ear piece break off, by 11 am i was at the market broiler, training to become a new foodserver, and by 4pm i found myself in the emergency room...again. all because i missed a wet floor sign and slipped...bad.  so heres the story:
staring at the ceiling lights, tears close to exploding from my eyes like a waterballon you drop as you try and fill it;  my knee, swollen like a grapefruit again, and the pain worse than before(only now i can only feel it on one side of the knee, since the other half is dead from surgery) and my mom sitting next to me, saying ""ya know what josh? this is a good time to talk....you need to change the way you are...to learn to respect me.""  i looked at her, as she sat in the chair next to the uncomfortable ER table and said, ""I need to change?  I need to change the fact that you threw me out of the house because you got mad about 4 dishes in the sink, because i blew out my knee...because i got a job, because ya'll wanted me to get one...when i was three weeks behind recovery. because ya'll dont think its neccessary that i go to physical therapy, and i slip and fall and end up here?  I need to change.""  i rolled my eyes to her and just said, ""go, leave, get the fuck out of here, because this isn't the time to talk about this...because i rushed out to get a job to survive since you think its neccessary to throw me on the street.""  she just sat there, pondering her next rebuttle, waiting for the right moment to use the cliche ""if ya wanna get out of a hole, stop digging"", cause damnt that was the next thing out of her hypocritical psycho mouth.  hello, this supposed hole is curtesy of the ones around me...MY FAMILY.  sure ill admit that ive pitched in to dig this fucking hole too, but for god's sake people,i already stopped digging, so stop fucking digging too!!  then brandy had the audacity to say, ""maybe you should find god.  i mean im not the one to say it, but maybe you need god.""  in as much pain as i was in, i almost got up and walked my ass out of the ER. i have nothing against god, but ya know what, god is not in my current list of goals, i have other plans.  anyways, you dont look for god, god finds you...its like love, you cant look for it cuz youll never find it, you can find it in the weirdest of places when you arent looking...clubs, airports, waterpolo games...hell now a days you can even find it on the internet.  
fastfoward to tuesday morning:
i had to be at my orthos office by 8, so i thought.  got there at 830, on time for my 830 appt, lucky me.  the xrays showed that the previously diagnosis of a fractured knee cap were false, and that the V-shaped chunk missing was from my graft used in my knee.  the next thing was that the graft was ok, and that i had not torn out the screws, nor damaged the graft i would be out of work for 3 weeks or more because of a severe bone bruise and contusion on the patella.  well all be damn, my luck is changing i thought.
skip to wed:
got an email from my mom, ""...grandma rented the penthouse at the bellagio, were flying out on the plane from john wayne at 10am, you can come if ya want to, just let your grandma know...""  so after i made a call to my mom saying ill go, i called grandma to let her know that id be joining only to have her tell me, ""no, you cant go...talk to me when you got your shit tooo-gett-hhher.""  the phone cut out, so that was all she had time to get in.  so as i put down the phone, and thought my sister is turning 21, this is a huge day wed talked about for years, and now, because of my grandma ruling the coop i cant be with her...hey, great...thanks for fucking this one up.

so now, here i sit...pondering just how the fuck im gettin to vegas, because if i can swing it..im gonna be in vegas. happy birthday sis."

"event","hey what a coincidence...i got kicked out of the house again!! wierd that never happens...except on days when brandy feels like shes got to freak out on me...wait, come to think of it...thats everyday! so yeah, here i am, going on the 3rd night out...yep, sunday morning brandy woke up on the wrong side of her stone bed and flipped out. it was quite a display of her vocabulary as well...fuck this and fuck that, fuck you, fuck your dad...hey you know its a good day when dad hasnt been around for years, and they havent talked in god knows how long, and he has nothing to do with a dish in the sink...yet he still gets a fuck you! so to sum it up, after brandy used all the experlatives she knew, in ever possible combination possible...she said leave your keys and get out of the house...so i did, left em by the door and left...havent been back yet...and havent talked to her since...shes called, left her dirty little messages, but, i dont answer...shes called my friends, who have also avoided her calls, nor returned them...see what brandy doesnt know is that none of my friends are going to give me up...one of her messages she wanted me to call her back and tell her where i am.  why?  why does she care...im not home and she should be happy with that...as am I.  but my family has turned their back on me...and right now most of all my friends are gone...so i really have no where to go, except where i am now...dustins house, with him and his family, who i totally enjoy hanging with and we always have a good time and laugh, and dustin has been there for me through everything...no questions asked.  and thats been extremely helpful to have someone to talk to...because no matter how many friends you have...youre truest friends are the ones who go out of their way for you when they know you have nothing in return to give.  
my uncle and i chatted...and he told me the same thing he has told me 3 times prior...and in all honesty, i want to do what he suggests, but the family seems to have this mental block that i have more problems than just whats going on in the world around me right now...when its the physical and mental struggles im dealing with at this current time that are the toughest ones im trying to get through without the proper care.
none the less, thats all there is about me right now...somewhere is that old happy josh...buried deeply in this horseshit...someday hell emerge."

"event","im awake, wide awake...its 530 in the morning!!! what am i doing to myself?  am i unknowingly and systematically trying to ruin my own life?  it feels like it.  laying in bed for soo long has driven to the brink of complete and utter laziness.  i dont want to do anything, except lay there...feeling sorry for myself, feeling sorry for my knee, feeling like ive let everyone down and now there is no where for me to go.  everyday my mom asks me to do this and that and i just sit there...it goes in one ear and out the other, and im happy in my comatose like state.  i need to get things going, i have to start rehabbing harder and more frequently...but the motivation to get out of bed and do it isnt there.  hell, i rarely eat now.  my muscles (or whats left of them) are sore from the little activity i will myself into doing.  i just wish i could get my family to see whats going on.  that i need help, i need their help, more than ever...but they blindly continue on in their chaotic lives.   why should they stop for me?  ive proven to be worthless to them, and they have no problem expressing that sediment to me.  in their eyes, its their form of motivation...when all it does is make everything seem soo much harder for me to accomplish, makes the light get that much dimmer....and just buries me further and further into that hole im in right now.  i soo badly want out...i want to do everything they ask of me...but i cant!  i try, and i try and i fail everytime...im sick with a crippling disease which they cannot see, and choose not to acknowledge.  so why do they get mad?  for once i just want them to catch a glimpse into my world, where a sunny day feels like a rainy one...where anger feels like blame and where i make my stand everyday.  i need a friend, ive tried to reach out to my old ones, and they push me away...i never thought i burned my bridges, but i must have, and no amount of apologies and kindness will ever build them again."

"event","my subconscious thoughts are jaded and immediately turn me away from anything which i once took pleasure.  love is just something for the moment and lust is a feeling you build on, anyone who believes differently is just trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  the words we speak never fulfill the actions in which we take to prove that our word is as good as the bond between the two exchanged.  this is all true and ive found that in its evil way, it all has a way of haunting me.   while everyone sits in the sun and gets their tan, i bask heavenly in the darkeness and increase my pleasureless today.
no matter how bad i think my day has been, i always have another day to beat it.
the last 4 years have passed in a blur, and happiness has fleetingly avoided me during that time.  moments of temporary and manufactured enjoyment have been there...but the simpleness of it all occupied me.  almost seems that the more i try and tread water to stay afloat, the quicker i sink to the bottom.  only when i stop treading all together do i find that i can manage at least a breath of air before another wave crashes down on me.  so regardless if i ""sink or swim"", i know that the bottom will still be waiting for me, and while i ask for the life preserver, those who can toss it to me...they sit and watch me flounder in water.  its beauty and serenity all rolled into one big ball of hypocracy and self loathing, aided by the fodder of the future."

"event","well, that is gonna have to be one of my most uncreative headlines to date...haha, oh well, over it!!  today i spent about 3 hours at the Pug Rescue fair at the Del Mar race track in San Diego...there were pugs everywhere...im talkin like 500 pugs, some were dressed up, and some were just there al natural...i saw a pug statute of liberity, a pug so small that i could have it ball up in my hat(it was just 6 weeks old), i saw a guy buy an outfit for his pug and then take it up on stage just to show off himself, and i saw the most attractive blonde(pug in tote)...but suprise suprise i knew her, kinda crazy...but it was a good day...megan actually asked me to go, and then last night as we talked about today, her friend tamra was like, ""oh, i love pugs.  i wanna go..""  so we took her along too.  i pretty much hobbled along on my crutches while they stopped to pet every single pug they could...ok, ill admit it, i snuck in a scratch here and there too...because yeah, ugly as they may be, they are kinda cute...in an ugly way.

after we got done with that it was back to megans pad, and then off to the sigma chi raggae fest...which by the time we got there, the boy at the door said sorry cant let you in...i was like what...hello, not only do i have Thetas with me, but my bro Lee is one of your heads in the house...although he doesnt live in the house anymore, and i had just actually provided him the neccessary means of a lean post since he was hammered and barely able to walk...which by the way, he  doesnt fucking remember seeing me today or talking to me...what a freggin alcoholic.   so after repeated attempts to enter into the party by the Thetas i was with, and my urging to just get the hell out of there and get off my feet we went back to megans and chilled..  

i was supposed to go out tonight, i needed to get out tonight, that was the whole reason i stayed here tonight...to go out.  vanessa was busy, megan went back to OC to see ryan, tamra was shot from all her puppy lovin today, my sister has to work in the morning so cant go out, kevin has to work at 3am, lee is still too drunk to recollect todays events and is laying on his couch...drinking, liesl has to work and cant come down, crystal didnt answer her phone...because her b/f says that she cant talk to me...which is bullshit, ive known her 8 fucking years, we dated 8 years ago when i lived in SD, and her family loves me...and i cant talk to her because some overbaring, control freak of an asshole boyfriend says so, shania is MIA, and to top this all off BRANDY is here tonight...shit man, shit.  

oh well, ill just have to throw in a dip and play some madden tonight...AGAIN!  without my pepsi though, which ive been craving all day...and havent gotten...ahh, see this is bad, i dont have nic fits, i have pepsi fits...time to work on the dome.

well i hope you have a great day...i miss you."

"event","she was old...
had been through her years...
seen her share of kids...
had her fill of love and affection from the family...
lived through other dogs much younger than herself who had parished abruptly...
this was the last show of love a family could give to such a devoted companion...
no one likes to see someone in pain...
wether it is human or animal...
pain is something no one likes to see another suffer through...
and she was in pain.

i remember when we first got her...
it was 14 years ago...
my cousins and i used to make her chase her tail...
and round and round she went till she, or my grandma couldnt take it anymore...
chris and i once took her for a walk...
her only walk that shes ever been on...
we walked probably 6 miles...
shasta made it about 2.5miles before laying down and refusing to go further...
so we carried her...
like a princess...
like a queen...
like a shasta i grew to love...
she would always bark and go crazy when i came around...
come up to my leg and rub her wet nose on it and poke at me till i scratched her...
she always listened when you told her something...
and if you tried to fight with one another...
or someone came at you...
she was the first to jump in to make sure you were ok.

shasta was as much a part of the family as anyone...
she was pampered and spoiled more than anyone...
or any dog for that matter...
i will for surely miss her...
she was a great friend who loved you even when you didnt look your best...
feel your best...
and she could always make you smile when you were feeling down...

that all went running through my head today as my mom greated me at the door to tell me that they were putting her down because she was in so much pain, and couldnt even stand up...even though she tried...and right now...i feel like i lost a family member and a friend...and thats a hurt that is hard to swallow...and as i fight back the tears...i just know that shes not in pain anymore, and thats all that really matters.

thank you shasta for everything"

as i sit here, painfully trying to bend my knee so that my foot can take a break from the ""peddle to the metal"" position, im always wondering...i think i really did myself in today when i found a book of quotes and started reading them...i found it amusing that there were more quotes about death than character...is character such a new and novel thing that we have not had sufficent time to reflect upon it...or is death how we truly define character...because according to James Barron Hope, ""tis after death that we measure men"", so in this instance what you do and who you are in life(when you are alive)  mean squat till youre 6 feet down, pushing up the daisies, and at the pearly gates...but we all know thats not true, and so do i...damn 

ever get tired of hearing ""ah, dont worry youll get used to it.""  i heard that alot when i first got to minnesota and the winter started to come, and the temperatures began dropping below zero...or when i was at camp daniel boone, in south carolina, and we had to do our lake swim.   well when i jumped into the water it was about 60 degrees, and being a portly young kid at the time, that was still cold for me, and yet, the instructor said hey...""youll get used to it""...how about pain, get enough pain and you get used to it?  i could see that, ive suffered alot of painful experiences in my time, broken this and sprained that...until i heard, torn this, and thats when i learned a whole new level of pain, the kind i hadnt gotten used to...but what about the stuff you cant just ""get used to""?  like the loss of a friend or family member to death, you never really get used to it no matter how much or how little it has happened, you never can quite prepare or handle the news.  or how about the loss of someone you love...im sure you have lost someone you love before where you just cant do anything to bring them back, and often times you can hang on to them for so long before they or you phase themselves out of the picture completely.  how about violence?  how about getting used to violence?  think if its on the TV enough that well just get used to it, that it just wont matter any more and although we want to  control violence and bring it to an end, we dont...then again im not the first to say this and im definately not the last....i just hate sounding like the rest.

so that was my day...and now i get to lay in bed for 5 days...on vicodin and icing.  although i wasnt hooked up to the ice machine that i was supposed to get and instead im having to use these gel bags...which are horrible because i get 2 hours and change really before i need to change them to get the maximium use out of them.  but oh well...im going to sleep now...im pooped."

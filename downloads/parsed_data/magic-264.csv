"event","There was a bunch of stuff I wanted to do tonight, but I've just been miserable. Sickly and grumpy and angry. I had to stop watching TV because every show I watched people were being so... annoying. Self-serving. Egotistical. Mean. I don't know. Bad things happen to good people. stupid world.&nbsp;
Things are all kind of&nbsp;nutty right now. Lisa's coming here for a visit next week. on her way to Maine, where she is moving to. It is crazy, but I think it&nbsp;is a good thing for her. As long as she is happy and safe, I can be&nbsp;content with that. &nbsp;Which means I won't have a place to stay in Victoria anymore, but since I don't have a lot of extra money, that is probably for the best.&nbsp;
School is... I don't know. I think I'm becoming more and more disillusioned and embittered&nbsp;each week. I know in the past I've had problems with just trying too hard, and then nothing works out. But usually&nbsp;I never know when&nbsp;I'm trying to hard until it all comes apart, and it blows up in&nbsp;my face. One would think determination and perciverience would be a good thing, but when is it time to cut my losses and step back, to get some perspective? Most of my midterms were awful. And by awful, I mean I got pretty much the class average in each one. Which shouldn't be too heart breaking, except that I've never been an average student, I've always been like, an A student. or a high B. I will never get into grad school if I keep getting average. I need a job. I need my lisence. I need to buck up and feel better. I need to finish my christmas shopping. 
I've finally made some friends here, gone out a few times. I actually went to a club here this weekend... it was lame-ass. Well, compared to Victoria. I still danced all night, and got hit on my funny drunk guys. But they played country music! well, not ALL... but more than they could get away with in Vic. And I wasn't at the cowboy bar! And the venue is just tiny.. I mean, I could easily see to the other side of the room. And then I was lonely and homesick, because the girls I was with knew like, half the bar, from school or TRU or work or whatever, and I knew 3 people. No asian mullet man. No dancing girls. No friendly bar tenders or familliar bouncers. No ex's of Lisa's or erin's or whoever. certainly no other belmont kids.&nbsp;

Gah... I'm totally being emo tonight. I'm even listening to emo-y music, I am so very cliche right now. Why aren't you people answering your phones? Don't you know I want to call you up and whine and talk about myself all night? come on now!"

"event","<p>As of today, It has been 1 year since I moved to Kamloops. I wore black today. <br /><br />I also went to Logan Lake, out for lunch with aunty rosanne and uncle mike to Milestones, because they are leaving tomorrow, and then out to Knouff lake, which is up by Sun Peaks I think. And then I found&nbsp;a geocache. Then came home and have been studying since. But Jamie cullum is haunting me again. Particularly, ""twentysomething"" which is about how you study your ass off and then all of a sudden you find yourself a twentysomething with no real point... you could work, you could fall in love, maybe that will solve all your problems,&nbsp;but you don't know dick about ""love"". you have all this anticipation and wonder, but you realize that ""the world don't need scholars as much as I thought"" He even mentions how being an expert on Shakespeare may SEEM like a great accomplishment, but that doesn't mean you'll be happy or content or anyone in the real world cares. screw it, you can read the lyrics yourself.</p>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Twentysomething lyrics."">After years of expensive education<br />A car full of books and anticipation<br />I'm an expert on Shakespeare and that's a hell of a lot<br />But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought<br />Maybe I'll go travelling for a year<br />Finding myself, or start a career<br />Could work the poor, though I'm hungry for fame<br />We all seem so different but we're just the same<br />Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat<br />Aren't things more easy, with a tight six pack<br />Who knows the answers, who do you trust<br />I can't even separate love from lust<br />Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans<br />Working nine to five, answering phones<br />But don't make me live for Friday nights<br />Drinking eight pints and getting in fights<br />Maybe I'll just fall in love<br />That could solve it all<br />Philosophers say that that's enough<br />There surely must be more<br />Love ain't the answer, nor is work<br />The truth eludes me so much it hurts<br />But I'm still having fun and I guess that's the key<br />I'm a twentysomething and I'll keep being me</div>"

I don't have any good books to read right now either. I have one, but it is a little too smart for my current state. and there are a couple I want to start, but they are both giant hardcovers, which are such a pain in the bum, as far as carrying them around, or leaving them on my pillow when I sleep. 
Over all, things are going quite well in my life. I totally don't want to move back to kamloops, but just when I start to think ""maybe I could take the year off school, switch to uvic..."" I go and look at my classes in all their psych (and english minor) glory, and I get all geeky excited. But theres like, a billion things I want to do here before I go back. I've found 97 geocaches.. I am super excited about making it to 100! I know I've found at least that many, but haven't logged them all. It is just a number, a stat, but still, it will be cool.
Kristi is back! yay!
what else... hmm... I don't know. Maybe I'll just go watch my illegally downloaded TV for a while, and hope I fall asleep to that. Or stay up really late and worry about whatever new prognosis House comes up with. 
good night
wow, this was a really lame update, considering the lack of updates lately. I would have thought i could have done better than that."

"event","Update, because I don't have much to do. Well, I do, but nothing fun today. And nothing concrete and productive. 
Soo... yeah. Moved back to Victoria for the summer. And finally I'm here, with all my stuff, after a few special little trials. 
I'm looking for a place to live, and consequently a job. Although I don't want to get a job until I know where abouts I'm going to live. And I've found a few places to live. The one place we really like is across the road from Lisa's place, pretty much. Like, a 1 minute walk. And the people are super nice, all utilities included, on nice bus routes, a nice neighborhood, fairly ccentral location. Our 2nd choice is in the quadra mcKenzie area, which is cheaper, but smaller, no internet, and no washer/dryer. On a bus route, but not so nice, and fairly out of the way. It would be different if one of us was going to school. 
So really, I have no idea whats going on. I really should be spazzing and freaking out and snapping because of my lack of direction and no control over the situation, but I'm not. Which is actually really nice. I think I just MAY have loosened up a bit! Thats what I'm most proud of. And its not even that I'm ""handling it well"", I just really don't mind too much. 
In the mean time I'm staying at Lisas... we're getting along fine.. the only time shes ever really home is when shes sleeping, shes either at work or at her barn, sometimes out with her boyfriend. So I cook and clean and terrorize the cat. Play some computer, go for walks, reading a lot... its a rough life, but I'm adapting. 
It is great to be back in Victoria, doing stuff. Where there is actually stuff to do! You can't really just go ""out"" in kamloops... you can't really wander around downtown, randomly stopping here or there, going in the different stores, watching street performers, visiting the waterfront or seals or whatever else. 
My personal life is also not going exactly according to my plans, and perhaps for the best. Again, I'm just kind of going along with things, trying not to freak out about it, enjoy what I can. So far so good. I'm starting to figure out that when I try too hard, things never work out. So hopefully when I just let things go, things will all work out nicely!

Also, my birthday soon. I am not quite sure whats going on with that, but I want to go out dancing! Hopefully saturday."

I dyed Easter eggs tonight! I'll try to post pictures tomorrow... we made a giant mess. We also made a cake, with like, 4 different types of sprinkles, mini m&ms, animal crackers, rocket candies... I think I'm missing something, but thats ok. yeah, good cake! and my easter eggs consist of a scottsman, a pirate, rainbow, squares... I can't think of the others. I have to post pictures. And kristi made the ninja turtles! So cool!
And my aunt, uncle, and cousins staying with me bought me a better video card (or whatever it was that my computer was lacking) for sharing my space and giving up my nice big bed, so  now I can play WoW on my computer, which is just trouble :) This also means my mom is probably going to buy me oblivion for my birthday. yay!
I'm just really optimistic right now, a lot of stuff to look forward to this summer, a lot of people I am looking forward to seeing again. Granted, that usually means there is a lot of room for disapointment and failed plans, but thats ok. Things even look good in Kamloops for the next little while. But maybe thats just because I know I am leaving ;)
I really should be going to bed, I work fairly early tomorrow.

"event","Ohmyfuckinggod I hate my film teacher so much. Aside from the fact that he's uber condescending, insulting, cuts off his students when they are talking/asking questions, hasn't actually taught us anything, and expects far too much from first year students, he assigned a $120 text book, and told us last night that it was a waste of money, because we won't need it for the class. HE TOLD US TO BUY IT THE FIRST WEEK! AND WE KEPT ASKING HIM ""should we be doing some readings or anything?"" ""oh, no, not yet"" he would reply. FUCKING BULLSHIT! Didn't ever even assign it for background info, or anything! In most classes you're at least supposed to be following along with the text throughout the class, even if it is just supplementary, and not testable or anything like that. I'm pretty sure mose teachers don't expect you to actually read it, except PERHAPS right before the test. But to not even use it for that??? and it would be one thing if it was like, a $40 text. or they had them used. or they could be in the book buy-back. But $120! and since they change the topic of the film class every time they teach it, it can't be bought back. And it was REQUIRED! there was an optional book, too, for an extra $40 that some kids bought, that is also not applicable or useful at all. 

And because I am trying to be less whiny and negative, I will end on a good note.
I love dusk... It is probably even cooler than any old cliche sunset. It has a spooky, mystical essence to it. And it plays tricks with your eyes, and your mind, because you have no sense of what colours things are supposed to be.. and the street lights are all kind of on, but they aren't really sure what the hell is going on either, because they look like they shouldn't be on, because there is still light, but then if they went off then it would be too dark... and this crazy sensation and confusion only lasts like, 5 minutes. but at the same time it is rather settling, cozy, calming... and its just not the same if you are inside, looking out. You have to be out in the middle of dusk, experiencing it. 
Hardly poetic, but there you go."

<div align=""left"">They have screwed around with the rich textness of LJ. So this might get a little messed up. Or I might get carried away. <sub>We'll see.</sub><br /><br />Other than that, I don't really have much to say. I suppose I could do a quick whats-going-on-in-my-life update, but I don't think anyone here really cares who doesn't already know. And not much is new anyways. Ah, well, what the hell.<br /><br />School is good, in the middle of another batch of midtermy goodness and papers. there is only like, 5 weeks left, give or take, and in that time I have 3 finals, 2 papers, and 1 presentation. Managable. <br />It turns out that I can't go to England (or australia) for school next year, as I was told at the last minute that I wouldn't be able to, due to my lack of a second language, that I'm supposed to be taking in my 3rd year. well, actually, I'm supposed to be taking it in my first or 2nd year, but that didn't happen. And it is a TRU thing, not a psych thing. Which of course broke my heart because I was already like, luggage shopping pretty much. went through a lovely few days of sulking and not talking to anyone and not eating. Then into a worse stage and bitchiness and eating everything in sight. Ok, it wasn't that bad. But I was crushed. <br />Work is fine... out of the 10 people in electronics, we're losing 3 within the next 4 weeks. 1 is already gone. and my boss is a jerk. and people are stupid. and customers make stuff up just to bug me. But I got a Harry Potter T-shirt! and a spokes-cowboy came in this week to promote Walk the Line, and he gave me a free poster and signed it. He was awesome! He'd pose, and tip his hat at all the ladies...&nbsp; But then he had to leave because he was late for his anime club meeting. so cute and dweeby! what a man! (no, I dont want to get with the wal mart spokes-cowboy. He just amused me, is all).<br /><br />So, I'm studying for my stats midterm (which is in less than 22 hours), and I come across this guy, William Gosset, who worked for Guiness breweries back int eh early 1900's, and how his love of barley and brewing inspired him to come up with the t-distribution, and a bunch of other important psych statistical concepts. Not to mention how much he must have contributed to the world of guiness! Personally, barley has never inspired me too much...<br /><br />you can tell I'm avoiding studying, with all the rambling I'm doing. Maybe its all the pink floyd I've been listening to... they kinda seem to just spit out random words in a nice little sing-song way, with little meaning or relevence.<br />
<div align=""center""><font color=""#000080""><em>The lunatic is in my head<br />The lunatic is in my head<br />You raise the blade,  you make the change<br />you re-arrange me till I'm sane</em></font></div>
&nbsp;Sorry if that offends any pink floyd fans in the crowd. Yay for drug use! It reminds me of my english class the other night... the teacher lectured for an hour on how our generation has it all wrong, that we use drugs for fun, not to expand our minds and reach enlightenment, which is what they should be for. We are shallow with our drug use, when it could be such an enriching experience. we're missing out. Then she went on to say that we were all stupid for going to school, and being arts students, because thats not the way to become successful and complete the american dream, and we are failing at life, in a way. Granted, we all know thats true, and it is not her way to sugar-coat things, but she doesn't need to be so tactless and explicit! and we all just laughed, because we know its true.<br /><br />I can't wait until next year, when I can actually get back to studying real psych... for the past 2 fucking years I've been taking ""biopsych"" and ""psych stats"" and ""psych research methods"" and ""the history of psych"", I miss studying actual people! Thats the part I love so much! I don't care their behaviour is within 2 standard deviations of the population mean, I care that they are doing it! ""and how does this make you feel?"" Soon enough...!<br /><br />we got a couple new foster kids yesterday. a 14 month old, and a 4 year old. Not bad (yet), but annoying. Especially when I'm studying for a midterm. Maybe they will settle down. Or maybe I will warm up to them. But they will be here for like, 3 months, so I suppose I should get used to it. Or move out. hey! now theres an idea...<br /><br />And just to make this post EXTRA long and annoying, here are the lyrics for the song I am currently listening to!:<br /><br /><font color=""#339966""><strong>THE JUICE OF THE BARLEY  </strong><br /><em>In the sweet country Lim'rick, one cold winter's night <br />All the turf fires were burning when I first saw the light; <br />And a drunken old midwife went tipsy with joy <br />As she danced round the floor with her slip of a boy,  <br /><br />Singing ban-ya-na mo if an-ga-na      <br />And the juice of the barley for me.  <br /><br />Well when I was a gossoon of eight years old or so <br />With me turf and me primer to school I did go. <br />To a dusty old school house without any door,<br />&nbsp;Where lay the school master blind drunk on the floor,  <br /><br />At the learning I wasn't such a genius I'm thinking, <br />But I soon bet the master entirely at drinking, <br />Not a wake or a wedding for five miles around, <br />But meself in the corner was sure to be found. <br /><br />One Sunday the priest thread me out from the altar <br />Saying you'll end up your days with your neck in a halter; <br />And you'll dance a fine jig between heaven and hell A<br />nd his words they did frighten me the truth for to tell,  <br /><br />So the very next morning as the dawn it did break <br />I went down to the vestry the pledge for to take, <br />And there in that room sat the priests in a bunch <br />Round a big roaring fire drinking tumblers of punch,  <br /><br />Well from that day to this I have wandered alone <br />I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none, <br />With the sky for me roof and the earth for me floor, <br />And I'll dance out my days frinking whiskey galore,</em></font><br /><br /><br /></div>

And I think I drank more coffee, and met more people, in the one week I was there than I have in the past month! And I seemed to have developed a thing for exclamation marks!
Also, I'm pretty sure I managed to keep myself more or less out of trouble! I pretty much know where I stand with everyone I interacted with, with no ugliness!

There are of course a couple people I missed out on the hanging out with. Hopefully I'll be back soon enough! You know who you are, and know that I feel bad for not seeing you!
also, I didn't get to go to Mr. Tubbs. Or goldstream. or stock up on my soap candy stock, although they might sell them here at Zack's candy shop, but its a matter of getting downtown to pick some up.

Score!  You have a prestige class.  A prestige class can only be taken after you've fulfilled certain requirements.  This may mean that you're an exceptionally talented person, but it probably doesn't.

Arcane Tricksters combine arcane magic with rogue skills and sensibilities.  They use their magic to confuse their opponents or to augment their more mundane, roguish skills.  If you thought it was annoying keeping an eye that that rogue, the Arcane Trickster is probably picking your pocket from the other side of the room.

ugh. the conservatives are stupid. And now they are in power. Well, minority power. Which means that they are evil, but slightly useless. And I don't like them. I wish I was in Victoria, where people actually care and get worked up about stuff, with even the odd protest or 2. Here about as wild as it gets is like, 3 kids wearing buttons with little slogans on them like ""howdy! I am not in favour of the conservatives, y'all"" or something along those lines. ok, that was a gross exageration. But still. Not nearly enough outrage to satisfy me. 

I forget why I was going to post. It wasn't just to complain about election results.

English looks like it will be SO interesting, but possibly over my head a bit. But full of the dorky, juicy, deep literary-type conversations that I adore! (I say this now, but watch 5 weeks from now when I am bitching and complaining that the lady is mad and makes up her own rules as she goes and is far too vague and wishy-washy, and I have a 1500 page paper due in 2 days)
I came back from my WONDERFUL trip to Victoria, enjoyed being back in my own realm for all of like, 30 minutes before I was homesick. I don't know if it is so much that I love Victoria, or just that I am dissatisfied with whats going on here. I thought I was doing ok, but the comparison between the 2 places was enlightening. So I am re-evaluating my options... more to come on that later, when I have scoped everything out and dwelled on it FAR too much :)  That's all I'm going to say on the matter for now. I'm sure those who I talk to on a semi-regular basis will hear all about it, and I'm sorry.

so it started off with me working the 11-7 shift again, and I came home, had a bagel, and slept for 4 hours. Then I got up, cleaned up a bit (but not much), and went out for a hike with my mom because it was sort of nice out (it is supposed to get up to 10 today though! wtf!). While I was out with my mom, they called me into work... so i went in at 4, (in jeans, dirty, wet, messy, hadn't showered, no smock or water bottle) and worked until 11. then it was 10:30. Then it was back to 11:30... so I spent 14.5 hours at walmart yesterday (I'm thinking I might be getting some overtime though, which is good!) and in that time I got hit on by a lesbian, sold hunting supplies to a REALLY drunk guy (I thought he was retarted, and it was like, 5 in the morning, he was there by himself. but when I wished him a good day, he was like ""good day? HA! I'm hammered!"" wow, only in kamloops), threatened to slap a customer, got accused of stealing ps2 games, found out I am no longer a cashier as of the 30th (no one had told me yet), but got offered a job in electronics! rock! it is less $, as I'm a ""sales associate"" not a cashier, but dude! electronics! video games and music and watching movies all day, from what I've heard. and my name came up out of all like, 20 temporary chirstmas staff from the front end! :) So... I still might suck at being a cashier, but that doesn't matter any more! oh! and on my lunch break (my morning bagel now long gone) I went to mcdonalds, and realized with horror I didn't have my wallet! I took it out of my purse when I went hiking! 
and then I came home and slept from 12 until 11... I slept in! and now I'm feeling much better, and very excited! It is christmas eve!"

"event","ok, so the night shift wasn't so bad after all. It was busy enough to not go crazy, but not busy enough for it to be considered ""busy""... between the 3 cashiers we did $21 000 in sales from 12-2, and then $25 000 in sales from 12-5, which pretty much sums up the night. It started off with typical late-night shoppers, then like, insomniacs, then people on their way home from the bar (drunk guys still think I'm cute- I haven't lost it! lol) and then there was a slightly awkward stage between them, and the people just getting up where we started all to get sleepy and kinda nuts... but then the manager bought us chocolate, and we got music, so we were ok again until the unsightly hour of 7. ALthough towords the end we were all moving quite slow, and didn't know if we were coming or going. ""have a good night.. day.. morning... whatever""

But I don't want to do it again tonight. lol.
and one of the creepy-ass night shift people looks like andre, my creepy camsoun/bus stalker. except with more hair. and he was talking to me last night. and my breaks were at roughly the same time as the entire nightcrew, so I'd be sitting in the lounge with alllll of them, and just me. and they are dirty and creepy and kept talking about dale (who was sitting right beside me) and teasing him about how he just can't stop masturbating, can't keep his hands out of his pants etc. it was nasty. Also, a lot of talk about toe nails. YUCK! thanks!

Did you know that victoria has an 11% chance of a white christmas? Here there is a 69% possibility (well, thats for kelowna, but thats close enough).. although it is supposed to rain for like, the next 3 days... it got up to 5 yesterday!!! so there might be little, or at least very crappy snow. Which would piss me off considerably, because I was actually looking forward to my first real white christmas!

I got all my courses figured out! well, not all. I WAS taking the 3 psychs, but I met with my advisor, who got me out of 2 of them! and I am officially minoring in english, so for the other 2 courses I have starting in january, I can take a 3rd or 4th year english, and 1 bonus course of whatever the hell I want! I am leaning towords something like a film studies or theatre class... something different! And for the first time an academic advisor told me I've done everything right, and everything looks very promising, and its not nearly as daunting as I had thought, and that there is going to be people to take care of me and make sure I am taking all the classes I need! None of that has ever happened for me! for the first time in like, forever, I am excited about school again! I think I might just need to hit up staples for a indulgent spree!
Also good stuff today- I got a library card! and I got to see the new Harry Potter movie! (I was supposed to go see rent, but this stupid 1 horse town isn't showing it. yet. they sure as hell better start.) And I had my cache approved! and no work!
Although, work is going very well. For anyone who hasn't heard, I have sold my soul to The Corporation, donned the blue smock, and taken employment at Wal-Mart. How may I help you today? I'm a cashier. A fairly bad one. But I'm getting better! and I already got a raise, for some unknown reason. I just signed some random paper without actually reading it when they said they were giving me more money, lol.

Pure Imagination, from teh Willy Wonka sound track

Hold your breath. 
Make a wish. 
Count to three. 

Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination 
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination. 
We'll begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation. 
What we'll see will defy explanation. 

If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it. 
Anything you want to do it. 
Want to change the world? 
There's nothing to it. 

There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination. 
Living there you'll be free if you truly wish to be.

"event","I figure I should update, because it is so much easier than writing a bunch of individual emails. Not that I won't do that too :)
Hmm... LJ seems different. Bigger? Maybe its just my browser or resolution or something. But thats neither here nor there.
So- life in Kamloops continues. I have my good days and my bad days still. Today is a good day, hense the public update. It actually snowed here last night! Like, as much snow as we get in Victoria all year! Not everywhere, just on the mountainy parts. So kristi and I went out geocaching in the snow, with all the mud. She was in shorts. Lots of fun! and lots of giggling, but that was mostly from me :) And all of the caches here aren't just like, on the side of the road, like in Victoria. It is like, hiking out into the ""forest"" for 45 minutes, up and down hills (Kamloops is a valley, after all)... I love it! Much to Kristi's dismay, lol. 
I've been accept to TRU, but there is so much stuff thats going wrong. Like, every single step. Hopefully that will make it just that much more enjoyable when its all over and done with. And it looks like I'll be taking just 3 psychs come january, if it all goes according to plan, so whats not to love, eh?
I'm totally spying on the neighbor boy right now... the window beyond my computer looks at their backyard, and he's outside sawing something. I'm pretty sure my mom is trying to restrain herself from going over there and setting up a play date for me. But after the neighbor on the other side asked ""what grade are you in"" to see if I would play with her little girls, I guess thats preferable. 
Over all I'm a lot more stable now than I was at the begining. I hate change. But I've got some perspective, I'm figuring some stuff out... priorities and what not. I'm not happy, but the potential is there. And I'm not whining... all the stuff is either things that I can't fix so I shouldn't worry about them, or things that I can fix, and I'm working twords that. (thats right- eating healthier, working out more, walking more, being all domestic with various porjects, painting and knitting and stuff). I have a sense of control again, which I'm sure most of you know is damn important to me. But like I said, its a good day.. its easy for me to say that now lol. Clearly I'm not quite done with my pensive moods and ""figuring stuff out"" and adapting to all the change. I'll update again when I have a bit more to say. bye!"

"event","From Wikipedia, for anyone who was wondering how big Kamloops is:

Kamloops is a city in central British Columbia, Canada at the confluence of the two branches of the Thompson River and on the shore of Kamloops Lake. It is the seat of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. Kamloops is also the ""Tournament Capital of Canada"".

History
The Kamloops area was inhabited by the Secwepemc (Shuswap) nation (part of the Salishan speaking people) prior to the arrival of European settlers. The first European explorers arrived in 1811, and a fur trading post was established by David Stuart in 1812 for the Pacific Fur Company. This was bought out by the North West Company shortly after, and by 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company had control of the fur trade in Kamloops.

The gold rush of the 1850's and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s brought further growth, resulting in the City of Kamloops being incorporated in 1893 with a population of about 500.

""Kamloops"" is the anglicized version of the Shuswap word ""Tk'emlups"", meaning 'where the rivers meet'. Shuswap is still actively spoken in the area by members of the Kamloops Indian Band.

Industry
Major Kamloops-area industries include primary resource processing (pulp mill, copper mine, ranching) as well as tertiary services (provincial lottery headquarters). Kamloops is also a transportation hub for the region, with three major highways, and a semi-international airport.

Climate
While situated in a semi-arid desert valley, Kamloops winters are generally mild with an occasional cold snap. Snow is common from December to March. Winter mean minimun temperature of -6.1'C and peak around -30'C. On the other hand, summers in Kamloops can be quite hot. Temperatures of above 40'C have been recorded.

Demographics
(according to Statistics Canada 2001 census)
Population: 77,281.
Growth Rate (1996-2001): 1.2%
Total Private Dwellings: 32,076
Area: 297.57 km2
Density: 259.7 people per km2"

"event","For anyone who didn't get the memo, I moved to kamloops. I appreciate all the good byes and emails and such from the people who bothered, and when I actually get a computer with internet, I will try to email you all back. 
As of now, I am in vancouver (we needed a IKEA trip to properly outfit our new house, of course), using my aunt's computer so this will be brief.
Kamloops DOES in fact smell like ass. or rather, it did the first day... it hasn't been too bad since. We got telephone service for the first time yesterday around noon, and as of last night around 7, I got our computers working a bit. Still no heat, that should be happening today. and hopefully TV/internet properly hooked up on friday. 
The house is very nice, although I am fairly lonely thus far... I've been playing a lot of oregon trail on the laptop, and banjo kazooie on the ol' n64. Kristi helped me the first day I got there... forced me to unpack... I haven't really done much since. the view is nice, for the area. hills with trees, and all the city lights. I've scouted out both arby's in kamloops, although its not nearly as exciting when I drive by the one multiple times a day. Me the nice neighbor lady and her kids, and she asked me if I babysit... as soon as she got past the ""what grade are you in?"" question. crazy lady! oh well, kristi found it funny. 
I'll update more when I get all hooked up! I think I'm going out geocaching now- yay!"

it all started one sunny summer day. Andrew and I headed down to the patch for shopping and to visit kergin and his zone friends as part of the 91 days of summer promo. it turns out that Kool radio had set up a booth just around the corner. Andrew and I, being the loyal fans of the zone that we are, went on a top-secret super-special spy mission to see what they were up to, complete with aliases and a hidden spy camera (in my phone). We even pretended to be kool fans, and went up and entered their little draw, and snagged little Kool water bottles, and reported back to the <strike> mother ship</strike> zone. 
the next day I get a call... it turns out I won the Kool big prize of tickets and accomadations to Destiny's Child in Vancouver! YAAAAAAAAAY! 
wait... destiny's child? hmmmm
But I'm going anyways. With erin. And since I have 2 double rooms, I am bringing andrew and kergy along too. And we will make a nice weekend out of it. science world, shopping, storyeum, the aquarium, the zoo, clubs, sheena... its all on the list! not that we will do it all, but we will have a good time all the same! 
In other news.. I'm still moving, not happy about it at all, and very slow at packing."

"event","ok, time for a semi-real update. Because I realized that I haven't actually had a personal update in years. yes, years. 
lets see here... Jim and I broke up. That was at the begining of July. We won't go into details, but it was for the best, I am confident in my actions, no regrets, and I don't think he hates me, so its all good. well, not quite, but its not ugly! obviously after over 4 years, ending things wasn't exactly easy, but it was time to move on. 
My parents sold my house and we're moving to kamloops. Lisa is staying here. I was going to, but realized that there isn't all that much here for me that I really need to stay for. I mean, I'm going to miss all my friends above all, and it breaks my heart to leave all you wonderful people behind, but I hope to come out and visit from time to time. Other than that, it was no job and community college, which I can do everywhere. And if I absolutely hate it in Kamloops, you might see me back here in a few months anyways :)  (I hear they get snow there! ew!) I move on September 29th. A few days after the GREEN DAY CONCERT! YAY!
speaking of concerts, I went to the armchair cynics cd party last night- it was fun. And I won tickets (thanks to the zone) to go see nickelback and bif naked, and the cute little opening band from vancouver Faber last weekend. Lots of fun there too. honestly, a bit more of a show than last night's adventure.
Other than that I've speant the summer tanning (yes, TANNING! ME! LITTLE PALE SARAH!) and shopping and geocaching and watching a lot of movies and the occasional day trips. Mostly thanks to andrew (who is my new boyfriend, and makes me very happy), sometimes kergin (we're just friends), and now kristi (shes sexY) since shes back for another... 5 days? But she'll be waiting for me in kamloops, so I won't miss her too much :)
alright, my playlist is over, sooner than I expected it would be, but that means I have to go have a shower and actually start my day. I might add more to this later."

"event","You know what I hate?
Advertisements at the begining of movies, in theaters. I mean, its one thing to have trailers for other movies. I'm ok with that. But when you start getting advertisements for websites and cars and food before hand? No fucking way! We're PAYING MONEY, we shouldn't have to be subjected to that! There is no need for more commercialism. And its not like, the buses, where they can use the extra money they get from advertising. Its movies, which make multi millions of dollars. 
and I'm semi-ok with little ads before the movies starts, when they are just showing random images and trivia and what not. 
But the act of adding in advertisements before the movie is an evil practice that I despise.



Edit: ok, I did a search for thsi after I ranted, and apperently there are a bunch of like, consummer groups and city councils etc that are passing bills and laws against this practice, or wanting 2 different start times, and such. I'm not the only one who hates this with a burning passion."

"event","Hmm school was pretty lame ass as always. Basically failing chemistry and french and I don't even care. OMG but the other day was awesome at lunch when this fat chick fell into the garbage pale and her shoe came off. I was laughing so hard I couldn't even breathe. It was AWESOME! I'm mean I know but I can't help it...Then me and katrina were walking past 'the bitches' locker and she bent down and i made a really loud fart noise hahaha that made my day. Then she was walking behind us again today and me and katrina just start talking about her so she can hear us and hopefully one day say something to us so I would have an excuse to beat the shiite out of her because i really can't stand her at this point. Her face annoys me. And she talks shit about everyone and their mom so she really just needs an asswooping. Cut french yesterday : X it was worth it though, i needed the exercise walking home haha. 14 DAYS TIL FALL OUT BOY!!"

"event","So today I'm sitting on the bus and some stupid freshman comes over and sits next to me. Of course she like crushes me with her humungo backpack. Then she starts talking to this girl across from her about how some girl is afraid of her and I looked at this chick like ''you must me kidding me''. She was literally 4 feet tall and thought she was the shit. It was actually really funny. Math class was fun. Me and Katrina sit right next to eachother so you would think we would talk instead of texting eachother, but no. We're just that awesome. But I guess we had to text eachother considering the ''adult convo'' we were having. Then I'm sitting in French class looking at my teacher and I realized her nose was crooked. It made me really T.O.'d because stupid things like that annoy the poop out of me. CAN'T WAIT TIL OCTOBER 11TH FOR THE FALL OUT BOY CONCERT! ONLY 21 DAYS AWAY!! WOOOO!!!"

"event","Well, I figured it was about time I updated. Today was the first day of school here. About time, huh? It went alright, coulda been better. My feet were killing me the whole day though because I wore crappy shoes =/. I have some pretty sweet classes like Italian, and my last period I could leave if I wanted to. yay. I'm increddibly tired though, so Im thinking of heading of to sleep. Hmmm. I broke up with my boyfriend, that's new news. I'm sick of guys lately, really. Relationships can go down the tubes in an instant, but what do I know. I need sleep, and this damn hurricane is really getting to me.


Goodnight.

"event","alright. even though nothing has been happening lately, i feel i could write alot. today was a pretty ok day. pretty positive im giong to homecoming with steven. gotta buy my ticket (and his caz he gave me his money, lol.) so whoever has lunch with me tomorrow..yea remind me please. i hope i get my candy from chorus tomorrow.yea im in chorus and dang straight candace and i sing our heart out. Dads been sending me to church lately. its ok i guess. i have made a couple friends, and my dad is friends with the pastor person..and yea i got a hopechest from there. im gonna try to go to the movies tomorrow night. of course ppl like hannah will have better things to do like go to a crazy concert :(..if only i was in on that action. hmm what else. Kyle has been talking about polotics lately. as for me i would say i dont like either presidents..both have views i disagree with. If i had to choose one, i must say Bush even though Bush has done some obsene things and many Americans were killed. i just dont like Kerry. Life honestly has been confusing lately, i wonder where my life is going, and i often think of what the future could hold. I cant predict it, but i hope it will all turn out well. k well im done with this.:) to all my friends..i love u <33"

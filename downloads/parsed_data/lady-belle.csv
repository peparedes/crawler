"event","So, 4am and my roommate comes into my room, completely hysterical. Her dog is acting really weird.. not able to stand up properly, really uncoordinated, panting heavily, drooling profusely, eyes really dilated, etc. She gets me because she needs to call an emergency vet but she's too freaked out to do it herself. I&nbsp;guess I inherited an ability to have grace under pressure from my mom because I was freaked out too but tried not to show it because I didn't want my roommate to freak out even more.

Anyway, so we go to the teaching hospital for vet med on campus and the doctor on duty determined that Gus (the dog) was having a seizure as a result to something he was exposed to.. most likely the dangerous little white mushrooms or toadstools that sprout up in these weird wet, humid early days of summer. Gus is given some doggy Valium and responds well to it. So for the most part, he's fine and will be monitored for the rest of today and part of tomorrow just as a precaution.

Now the thing that makes this exceptionally LJ worthy is that I&nbsp;had no idea that dogs and the emergency care sometimes required could be so ridiculously expensive. The UGA Emergency Clinic has a mandatory $150 fee for any pet seen outside of regular hours. Ok, lots of clinics have that. It's just something you gotta deal with.&nbsp;But I&nbsp;had no idea that Gus's tests and exam would total to nearly $2000! And I&nbsp;understand that vet clinics are businesses like any other business, but to require a pet owner to put down half of the estimated cost as a deposit is ridiculous. So my roommate had to drop $1000 this morning because the estimated cost of Gus's treatment would be close to $2000. 

This whole ordeal got me thinking about how much, in a situation like that, I'd still be totally reliant on my parents. I don't think I've ever had over $1000 in my account at any given time, even when I was working part-time. Sure,&nbsp;I put away a little bit of each paycheck in my savings account, but it was never more than $500 worth of savings. It really just makes me want to get a job that much more.&nbsp;Throughout my time at UGA,&nbsp;I relied on my parents a lot for &quot;spending&quot; money. I'm sure a lot of that actually came from my student loans and that paying those back will really be solely my responsibility, but I&nbsp;just feel really helpless a lot of the time. I'm ready for my fun-filled summer but I'm also looking forward to getting a job and working and feeling like a productive member of society."

"event","Seven days (not counting the weekend and Memorial Day) until my last semester at UGA is over! I can't tell you how excited and sad that makes me feel. Excited that I'm finished, excited that I'm going back home, excited that in the near future I'll be opening a new chapter in my life by hopefully getting into grad school. However, I'm sad for basically the same reasons.&nbsp;It's a strange, discomforting feeling to have conflicting emotions about a situation. It leads me to generally feel uneasy and sort of nervous.

At least I'll have some immediate distractions to take my mind off of things. In mid-June I'm going to my home away from home (Orlando) for a week, as per tradition. Then I'll be back in Athens at the end of June because a friend/love interest is visiting from Boston and I promised him a good time (maybe more ways than one *wink*).&nbsp;Then after he leaves, my parents are coming up to help me move out. Then I'll be done in Athens.

Unlike a lot of people I know from here,&nbsp;my attachment to the school isn't ridiculously strong.&nbsp;I never felt the need to get a class ring and I probably won't frame my degree in a UGA frame.&nbsp;That being said,&nbsp;I will most definitely miss this place. When you live somewhere for two years, no matter how much you like or dislike it, you won't ever forget it. This was true for my brief stay at Georgia Tech. While my daily life was pretty much what I'd expect purgatory to be like, the place had its moments that will definitely stay in my mental photo album. 

I don't want to start rambling or waxing nostalgic. Just wanted to throw out my mixed feelings about my situation. I think my excitement for what's to come is sort of overriding whatever sadness the thought of leaving this behind is causing."

"event","So from May 12 until June 3, I'm submitting myself to the most vile torture known to man. No, dear readers,&nbsp;I am not referring to water-boarding, although that may be more bearable than this. &quot;This&quot; is referring to the short, condensed semester called Maymester here at UGA. Maymester packs all the readings and tests of a normal five-month semester into a very brief 3 week period. A typical class will run 2.5 hours a day, leaving you the rest of your day to continue being a productive member of society... sanity fully intact. I opted to finish my undergraduate career with a bang (no, I'm not alluding to a gunshot to my temple... though that might be welcomed before it's all said and done) and brave the Maymester goodness.<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately, to finish my undergraduate career, I&nbsp;needed 5 credit hours. Thus, I&nbsp;arrived at the conclusion that I&nbsp;should take two Maymesters. TWO. MAYMESTERS. I'm in class from 9:30 to 12:15 and then from 12:30 to 3:15. So basically,&nbsp;I'm on campus from 8:45 until 4:00 every single day for three weeks. Last week went by fine, but that was the calm before the storm I'm thinking. My required reading per night had not yet reached the impossible 200+ pages PER CLASS that it has this week. I was confident a week ago.&nbsp;Today, I'm starting to worry.<br /><br /><br />Take last night's required readings. For my HIST 4120 (Civil Rights Movement), I was technically supposed to read all of <u>Ready from Within</u><u>:&nbsp;The Story of Septima Clark</u> and all of <u>For Freedom's Sake: The Story of Fannie Lou Hamer</u>. Both of those books is well over 200 pages of civil rights goodness. For my HIST 4420 (Holocaust), I was supposed to read the first four chapters of our &quot;textbook&quot; <u>War and Genocide</u> and all of the autobiographical <u>My German Question</u> by&nbsp;Peter Gay. What did I successfully end up reading? Well, to answer that, let me paint a picture for you.<br /><br />Technically speaking, we were to have read Gay's book by yesterday. Assuming we all had, my professor had us do a group activity where we answered some serious questions. Upon learning of our failure to do so, my professor made us all feel like piss-ants and calmly instructed us to have the book read by today so that we may have a quiz over it. Now, the professor of this class is one whom I've had for two previous semesters. Needless to say,&nbsp;I really enjoy her classes. However,&nbsp;I could see that a little bit of whatever reciprocal respect she had for me died a little. Now, I&nbsp;hate feeling like a failure to anyone or anything, so I&nbsp;left class yesterday with a renewed resolve. So of course I&nbsp;opted to finish the Holocaust books. The knowledge of having a quiz versus just being unprepared for a class will generally make one's mind up.<br /><br /><br />(TL; DR&nbsp;Version: I think the Holocaust class is a little more important for my grade than the Civil Rights Movement books... at least for right now.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />At any rate, I'm very much looking forward to the weekend. The extra day off for Memorial Day will hopefully be opportunity to catch up on whatever I need to read to keep my head afloat. Hopefully. I&nbsp;tend to get distracted easily though....&nbsp; oh look, Food Network is on!<br /><br />"

"event","So last night,&nbsp;I was just sort of doing nothing on the internet for a couple hours. I&nbsp;had eaten dinner early in the evening, but I&nbsp;tend to crave snacks not long after eating. Last night was no different. As I sat contemplating what I&nbsp;wanted, I&nbsp;remembered a full, fresh jar of pickles in the fridge. Mm, pickles. (I know most people might cringe at just eating a pickle by itself, but it's divine.) At any rate, I make my way downstairs after resolving to return with a pickle (or two). Seeing as my roommates and my roommate's ex-boyfriend are downstairs watching TV, I know I&nbsp;need to be ninja-like with my approach: silent and efficient.

I open the door of the fridge and spot my prey, that unopened jar of crunchy, salty, garlicky goodness and make my grab. Picking the jar up by the top, carefully pulling the jar from the door, going to place it on the counter where a neatly folded paper towel prepares to be the nest of my pickle. The jar had other plans, however. My delicate touch was no match for the formidable defense of the pickle jar.&nbsp;It leaped from my hands and onto the ground.&nbsp;Mid-air, I&nbsp;saw it tumbling downward and it was as if time stood still. In that split second, I knew exactly what had happened and my catlike reflexes were not catlike enough. The jar was lost. The casualties lie in a pool of garlic brine on the kitchen floor, with shards of glass radiating from the epicenter. There I was, stuck in the battlefield, barefoot and helpless, while my comrades lie lifelessly on the tile. The enemy had won.

My resolve was not yet broken though. The Five Second Rule to Food Warfare still applied. After a brief mourning session, one of my roommates allied with me and joined the cause! Determined to allow me to taste a pickle once again, she braved the minefield that was the kitchen floor. Our sense of smell was assaulted by the pungent aroma of garlic and vinegar, our sight blinded by the shiny glass shards on the floor reflecting the light above, our hearing impaired by the noise of the television. Carefully, we made our way through the minefield of glass. I saved my pickle comrades one by one and breathed new life into them with a quick cleaning. Meanwhile, my ally was delicately disarming the glass grenades and disposing of them properly. Things were beginning to turn for us. 

Clean-up and disarmament continued swimmingly. The flood of pickle juice did not cause collateral damage, the glass grenades were being carefully removed. And then, out of nowhere, my delicate bare foot struck a shard. The tiny mutant glass sliver pierced my flesh instantaneously. Blood seeped mercilessly for what seemed like an eternity. Quick to my rescue, my ally performed some field first aid and I was renewed!

When it was all over and the battlefield on our kitchen floor became normal and hospitable again, I&nbsp;sent my pickle troops home, back to the fridge, saving two out for me. With a bandaid on my foot and armed with two pickles, I set about to return to my room. I was just about to enjoy the presence of my pickled friends when&nbsp;I suddenly realized I was hungry not for pickles, but something else... something far more deviant.

"event","Considering there are 52 weeks in a year, that's pretty impressive.

So&nbsp;I know I do this frequently; write religiously for several weeks then go months without an entry then come back and write for more days or weeks, then disappear again. With the advent of minutely updates on Facebook, the need to express oneself in an online journal has sort of fallen by the wayside. However, Facebook's status updates really only allow a person to express an immediate emotion or mood. LiveJournal can sort of allow someone to expand on an emotion or mood. And that's what I intend to do.


Alright, so it's been well over a year since my last entry. I was reading through all of my old entries and it's really shocking how little some things have changed and how much other things have changed. So my last entry said something about my first semester at UGA and how well things were going. It's all pretty much the same. Same house, new people.&nbsp;Taylor (old high school bestie, mentioned in several earlier entries) is one of my roommates. The other is a girl from Jacksonville, FL who actually lived on a boat for several years, sailing around the world. Her name is Katie too, which was weird to hear at first but I got used to it. Aside from typical roommate issues, this year has gone by swimmingly.&nbsp;Maybe too fast for my tastes, considering it's my last year as an undergrad. 

I'm currently taking two short-term summer courses (lovingly referred to as Maymester courses) and they -- knock on wood -- will be my last classes at UGA. I've come such a long way in such a relatively short amount of time. My dad told me when I&nbsp;first moved to Athens that he was proud of me and knew that I was resilient and would adjust quickly. I&nbsp;thought he was crazy at the time, but he was totally right. It really didn't take long to adjust and now I'm at the point where I&nbsp;don't really want to leave.&nbsp;I don't want to leave Athens,&nbsp;I don't want to leave&nbsp;UGA, I don't want to leave this crappy rental house... these things have made me realize that the transition to full adulthood isn't that bad.&nbsp;It has its scary moments, but as with all things in life, you really do have to take the good with the bad. It makes the sweet that much sweeter when you have really bad lows. 

I'm still an idealist I think. It's why I&nbsp;&quot;escape&quot; to situations and things separate from the real world: video games (I had a serious WoW addiction that has lessened in intensity recently), movies, TV&nbsp;shows, music even. It actually makes me cringe at how much I&nbsp;used to love music.&nbsp;Every entry from a couple years ago would involve referring to some song or some band. Now, the music of my life is just what I&nbsp;hear on a day-to-day basis: the gentle hum of my computer, TV on in the background, my roommate's dog barking, muffled loud music from my neighbors, sirens of police cars and ambulances, the background music of whatever game I'm playing.... all of these things have replaced my Beatles and my Led&nbsp;Zeppelin.&nbsp;

The closer I&nbsp;get to finishing college, at least for the immediate future, the more nostalgic I feel. What will going back home to live be like when&nbsp;I've been doing my own thing for basically 2 years? Sure,&nbsp;I've been home for long stretches before but I always knew that I'd be going back to&nbsp;Athens at some point. What am&nbsp;I&nbsp;going to feel when&nbsp;I've packed all my things from my house here and I'm driving out of the neighborhood for the last time? Will it evoke the same sort of emotional breakdown that I&nbsp;felt when&nbsp;I did the same thing leaving Albany? I love my family dearly and I'd go anywhere with them -- it's not about the actual location of&nbsp;Albany but rather the presence of being with my family. I don't know how I'll feel. As I sit here and think about it, I&nbsp;feel similar pangs of despair. Two years ago, it was the despair of leaving my family behind.. leaving everything I've ever known behind. Now, it is the despair of leaving the first taste of true independence behind.. leaving my &quot;family&quot; here, my roommates, my professors, my university. This collegiate experience has been so very important to me that I wouldn't trade it for anything, despite protesting it so much at first.

I met up with one of my old roommates from last year when&nbsp;I was out last night. Even in a partially-drunken haze I felt sad that she had left UGA and established herself at a new school with new people... completely fresh. I&nbsp;didn't feel sad for her.. I'm actually thrilled that she's managed to do that. I&nbsp;felt sad for myself. I feel like I'm clinging on to college and being here in a weird unnatural sort of way. Children always have to leave their parents' nest. But not all birds return.

People have been telling me that you can't go home again. I believe that there is some truth to that statement. I&nbsp;don't expect to go home and immediately revert to pre-college behaviors or thoughts. I know the first few weeks if not months of being home will be weird and I'll have to adjust accordingly. The trick to going home again and being well-adjusted is compromise. I&nbsp;don't expect to be able to always do what I was able to do in college. But I&nbsp;also don't expect to be treated like I'm in high school again. I'm quite sure that I'll carry some of my collegiate behaviors back home and it will annoy my parents greatly. I'm also sure that they will adjust to me just as I will adjust to them. So there is *some* truth to that phrase, but I'll just have to wait and see as to the degree of truth."

"event","So the last entry was December, before my finals. I should mention that those tests really weren't bad, but I still hated that Religion class. All that time and effort spent going to study sessions and I still only got a B in the class. Wtf.

Christmas Break went really well. Had a lot of family in town for the better part of a week and that's always fun. Over the course of the three weeks I was home, I had to decide if I wanted to keep the classes I had signed up for or if I wanted to drop one. I decided for sure to drop the Spanish (I can take it anytime) in anticipation of getting a job or looking into undergraduate research opportunities. Fast forward to the first week of this semester...

... I started with PSYC 2990, PSYC 3230, PSYC 3030, and PSYC 4200 and ended up with PSYC 2990, PSYC 3230, PSYC 4200, and PSYC 4800. The 4800 is my undergrad research, which pretty much fell in my lap. Awesome.

So it's nearing the end of February and Spring Break will be in a mere 18 days... I can't believe how fast this semester has gone so far! I anticipate smooth sailing for the rest of the semester but I must confess that I've started playing WoW again and I feel myself caring less and less about my 10:10AM classes on MWF. Oh well.


I would say that I've got some homework to run off and do but I really don't. In fact, I can count the number of homework assignments I've had so far on one hand (3, to be specific). It'll probably get a little more hectic later this semester though. :)

Normally, repetition is my key to learning things so I figured if I rewrite (handwritten, not typed) my notes that it would stick a lot better.

"event","So finals are in 4 days and I haven't really even given studying a second though yet. Actually, that's a lie. I think about studying all the time. In fact, it's like an ever-increasing weight on my chest that is really starting to bog me down. I never used to feel like this about tests and stuff. I guess I've come to realize that tests, specifically final exams, really have an impact on your overall grade in a class. And then grades in classes affect your GPA, which determines eligibility for lots of things: Hope Scholarships, student discounts, etc etc. So while I've been thinking about studying and not actually doing any, all of these things run in and out of my brain. The overall effect is one of a general relaxed anxiety. It will become less and less relaxed as Wednesday and Friday get closer to me.

And I don't even really know I'm bitching. My ""final"" on Wednesday is simply the last test of the semester for my Anthropology class and my ""final"" on Friday is just the second of two tests in my Religion class. I guess I'm nervous/anxious/whatever because deep down I know that these classes are superficially difficult. They're both relatively low level classes that pretty much everyone has to take at some point. The Anthropology class is taught by a guy who JUST GRADUATED with his Ph.D and has never taught a class before. Trust me, it shows. And the Religion class is taught by a wannabe guru guy or something. That class is so unorganized and all over the place that I pretty much stopped going to lectures. I still went to the TA breakout sessions, but they weren't really helpful. Baxter Street Bookstore's Student Notes section is pretty much the only reason I think I have a chance to do well on the exam. Since I stopped attending lectures, there are gaping holes in my notes and nothing really makes sense. So I shelled out the $14 to get the entire second half of the semester of notes in hopes that I'll use those to study. We'll see.

At any rate, commencement of studying probably won't happen til Monday afternoon/night. I just haven't quite got bored enough to want to study and I don't yet have that sense of urgency where I feel like I need to study. I'm in a weird limbo stage. I do know that I'm ready to put this semester in the books, take a long break, then start fresh next semester. I really have a lot that I want to do but will have to organize my time a lot better. The closest I've gotten to having a 15 hour semester AND hold a job was Spring 2007. I was working at the Y and was taking 15 hours at Darton. The key differences being that my job at the Y still allowed late night study sessions if required and Darton's classes weren't UGA classes. And they definitely weren't upper level Psychology classes. I really do hope that all goes well for me next semester. I need to stop feeling like a worthless bump on a log. I have a lot of New Year's Resolutions and I really want to stick to 'em.

For my own sanity, I think I'll list them:
1. Cook for myself more -- I'm not on a mealplan so I pretty much HAVE to cook for myself, but I need to learn to cook quick, easy, cheap things other than Hamburger Helper. Then, maybe I can invite people for dinner and not feel lame for only serving Hamburger Helper.
2. Budget my time better -- While I still love to play video games and waste hours watching TV and stuff, I need to learn to appreciate free time more, while having less overall. I have a sneaking suspicion this semester will sneak up on me in terms of overall business.
3. Find an appreciation for wine -- It makes you look classy plus I hear it's good for you...
4. Drink less Mountain Dew -- One day, my jackrabbit-like metabolism will slow down and if I keep drinking a healthy 3-4 Mountain Dews a day, I'll plump up like Rosie O'Donnell on a bad day.
5. Drink more water -- Sort of goes with #4. Plus I hear it's healthy for you too...

More later perhaps."

At any rate, this semester is almost over and I'm that much closer to graduating. Of course, I really have no idea when I'll be graduating (slated for Fall 2009, I think) so I could just be lulling myself into a false sense of security. The plan for next semester is to take 15 total hours and possibly find a job. I understand that *I'LL* be the one having to pay my student loans all back after I graduate (eventually) but it's still a blow to my ego to constantly have to ask my parents to transfer money to me. I'd rather just have a job to pay for the little things that I miss buying for myself (a shirt here, a pair of jeans there, maybe something nerdy like a video game, etc etc). Yeah, a job to pay for the little things. And gas. Because at $3/gallon, gas is like liquid gold.

Back home when I was working at the Y, I made enough money every two weeks to have more than what I needed for gas and occasionally food. The rest would sit safely in my checking account or savings account. It's amazing to me how quickly that money can get depleted and you don't even notice it. I hate feeling vulnerable like this. The beginning of the semester wasn't easy for me but I've adjusted quite well and now having to ask mom and dad for money for X,Y, or Z seems like a step backwards when I've made several steps forward.

I used to be terrified of ""growing up"". In fact, it sent me into the first (and only) panic attack of my life back in August. I was convinced that once mom and dad drove out of Athens, I'd be stuck up here thrust headfirst into adulthood and I knew I wasn't ready. It took a few weeks (and many inspirational conversations with my family) to realize that growing up doesn't happen overnight. It's a process, like all things in life, and these things take time. 

So here I sit, a mere week or so away from being done with my first semester here at UGA, having lived in a house without my parents but with two previously random strangers, being of sound mind and body (sort of).... and I'm ready to see what happens next. If you would have told me back in August that I'd be a happy, healthy 20-year old who doesn't mind not being home for weeks on end or who doesn't mind having to feed herself everyday or who doesn't mind sharing a house with two other people, I probably would've said you're crazy.

Whew. It's hard to put an entire semester of life into a single journal entry, but aside from early nerves and anxiety, I've come a long way and life is normal. It should be interesting to see how I deal with being home for nearly a month and then turning around to come back to Athens for another semester. I sincerely hope that when I leave in January, it won't be half the battle it was for me in August. Time will tell."

I'm kind of glad it is though because it has unofficially solved some disputes my dad and I have had about dates of events in the past. For instance, we were trying to figure out how old my dog is and I solved the mystery -- she's 4. 

Anyway, so many things have changed in life. I was reading old entries from high school, which morphed into old entries from pre-college, which morphed into entries from Georgia Tech, and then there were like.. three entries from after Tech. Then nothing. It's amazing how emo I sounded back in the day -- constantly whining and complaining about myself. I promise I'm not emo!

Like I said, there are like 46476235462356 things different from last time I posted. First of all, I'm currently attending UGA. Yep, I decided to transfer from Darton (where I was post-Tech) to UGA after I completed my Associate's Degree in Sociology. So I'm attending UGA as a Psychology major. (Far cry from a Computer Science major at Tech, right?) My semester's actually almost over because it's... December 2... Anyway! I'm living in a house with two awesome girls that's literally five minutes (if that) from campus. I was completely miserable at Tech and hated it so much that I left after only one semester. Spent the next year and a half at Darton, working on my two-year degree and working at the YMCA. Quit the YMCA in July(ish) and moved in here in Athens in late August. And I've been here since.

Dated a guy from March until a few months ago. Spent the summer pretty much taking classes, working, and being otherwise lazy. Was addicted to World of Warcraft for a LONG time and then the addiction broke when I moved in up here (didn't bring my beast of a computer to play it on and lacked the time to play). It's been an amazingly fun semester thus far. Established a small group of friends and living with Kellie and Christy is just fantastic. 

So besides my life pretty much making a complete 180, I'm otherwise the same. :p"

"event","Wow. Ok, so for the last.. long period of time.. I don't even know when I updated last. Anyway. I'm at home. Going to a local college instead of Georgia Tech. I really need a job. I just ended a relationship with a certain someone. I'm ready for summer. I think I've finally decided on a major. I'm really bored and lonely. I need some socialization soon. I can't wait for the end of May. I really want to get wasted soon for no reason other than being completely trashed. I've grown bored with my classes and as a result, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to give a shit about them.

I feel really awful about the relationship that just ended, but I know it was for the best. I guess if things were different, maybe it might have worked. But I think it was about chemistry, not location. Anyway, I just need to go out and stuff. I really need a job because I've got a bit of financial difficulties right now. Stupid college. I could rant four pages about that, but I won't. I wanted to go for a drive on the highway for no particular reason other than driving and just relaxing. Unlike most people, I find highway driving incredibly relaxing and peaceful (for the most part).

Anyway. That's that. I know I always say that I'll try to keep this updated and it never happens, but I'll try to keep it updated. IF ANYONE NEEDS ME FOR A JOB, PLEASE HIRE ME. :("

The only thing I'm bummed about is that the UGA/GT game will be televised on ABC, but we don't get an ABC affiliate at home. (Silly satellite people.) I might have to go somewhere else. I don't want to miss it.

Anyway, yeah. So a week from now I'll totally be on the road home. I'm so looking forward to it. I get to spend a glorious five days at home. The driving isn't bad. I get away from everyone, listening to music. It's nice. I would do it all the time if my ass didn't get so numb from sitting in one spot for hours at the time. So yeah, reaaaally glad I'm going home. And I'm really glad that I won't be back next semester. Being home seems infinitely better than being here. Plus I really miss my brother. He's a pain at times, but God knows I love him more than anything else.

Okay, so history test Friday, Calculus quiz tomorrow.. beyond that, I'm home free. \o/"

So I totally did a webpage for m y computer science class. http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gth659x so if you're feeling grand, go for it. (I have no idea if that links itself or what.) 

So yeah. Life is good right now. I'm a little sleepy, but it's all good. Got nowhere to be tomorrow. Nothing to do except for reading for history (fun stuff, right?) and I'm a smidge thirsty. No big deal.

I want to drink and party and have a really good time, but I've got lots of stuff to worry about and that's really the last thing I need to be doing right now. Plus I think I'm probably coming down with a cold.

Partying loses its appeal if you do it too often. So go crazy, but don't go crazy all the time. Besides, last night I went to bed at 10PM and didn't get my ass out of bed the next morning until about 11:15AM. So grand. So, I'll probably watch TV and relax here until I get sleepy enough to go to bed. My roommate will be gone all night so I'll have the room (all 100 square feet of it) to myself. :p

I wish JD was here. He'd be a great snuggle buddy. And it's cold outside, so we'd totally be warm. *sigh* I'm tiiiiiired. Tired, but not sleepy. Yes, it's weird. No, I don't know how I can be tired but not sleepy. Oh well. Enough ranting for tonight. There was something sort of important that I wanted to talk about but I definitely don't remember what it was now. Whatever. It's an entry for another night."

"event","So yeah, Fall Break was from Friday, Oct. 14 to Tuesday, Oct. 18. It was really short, but totally needed. The best part is that I drove myself back to Atlanta -- by myself (which was a little nerve-wracking, but otherwise good). So now I'll get to have my car here on campus (well, sort of on campus) and I can go home whenever I want. The drive is easy and it gets quicker every time I ride/drive it. Yay.


So yeah, I installed The Sims (and its various expansion packs) on this computer, so I might not update/be online as much I usually am. At least, not for inane things. ;) Hopefully I'll still have all the free time I had before Fall Break (hence the desire for having something to do in my boredom). I'm worried about my Calculus class though. I've failed two tests -- one with a 62 and one with a 68. The professor will drop the lowest test grade (that's good) but I'm still worried about the class. I can't help it -- I'm such a nerd at heart. I figure, if I can get a B in CS, and A's in English and History, I could get a C in Calculus and still maintain my scholarship. Of course, I'd much rather get A's and B's in everything that way I don't have to worry about it, but I'm just thinking realistically. I have no idea if it's possible for me to pull a B in Calculus. I guess I'd have to ace the hell out of the final, but that's really scary -- to rely completely on ONE test to either fail or pass a course. Scaaary. Scary in that I've never been in this type of predicament before. In high school, it was just assumed that I'd get at least a B in every class. Hell, even A's were more commonplace for me than B's, so even a B was ""low"". *sigh* Life is hard and I'm a bit stressed/hormonal/emotional at the moment. So yeah, that's all I've got to say. I've got class now..."

It's cool though. Things are normal(izing) for the most part. The only class I really don't like is Calculus and that's only because I'm not doing so hot in it. The professor is okay, but he's got an accent from Bulgaria, I think, and it's a little strange to go from the annoying Southern drawl to the equally-annoying, yet harder-to-understand eastern European accent. *sigh* Buuuuuut, the other classes are fine. I'm actually on Fall Break right now, so I'm in my OWN bed at HOME with my dog Ringo sleeping soundly at my feet. He's so cherubic when he's sleeping, but he stole my coffee earlier, so I'm not speaking to him. I literally set it down for two seconds and he started drinking it. >_> I'm surprised he's not awake. 

Anyway, we're going to Tallahassee tomorrow for shopping and my dad wants me to drive so I should probably sleep. However, I really think I should go into a LITTLE more detail. However, once I start divulging about college life, it'll be a five-page long rant and rave about random shit. So I'll just condense it VERY briefly...

Social life is good. I've got lots of new friends/acquaintances. I hang out at the frat on the weekends (most weekends, at least).
Academics are good except for Calculus. I had to program this nifty little GPA calculator for part of my last CS homework, so I figured that I could make a C in Calculus if I got two A's and a B in my other classes. Doesn't sound too hard, right? :p
Mentally, I'm pretty normal.
Physically, I feel like I've been gaining weight. Too many soft-serve ice creams at random hours of the day, I guess. Apparently though, I'm not fatter. Well, maybe less toned than I was. Whatever. The CRC is too far away. >_> .... <_< .... >_> Yeah, that's MY excuse, what's yours?
Everything else is just sort of falling into place. Life is good and I hope it stays that way. I like being home. It's nice to have my family close by, but I still feel like I'm a stranger now. Like, just a visitor. Welcome, but if I stay too long, emotions when I leave again will be high. Christmas Holidays are going to be odd, I think. I'll be home for nearly a month, so when I have to go back again, it'll be weird. I dunno... we'll cross that bridge when we get to it, I suppose.


Anyway, I'm tired.

"event","I was up really late last night. (Gee, I wonder why. It was a game day. We won. I was at a frat house. Gee.. you do the math.) Anyway, I can't for the life of me figure out why when I wake up in the morning after drinking I crave salty things. I had a bowl of soup at 11AM and then a bowl of ramen noodles at 2:30 or so. It's strange.

In other news, nothing terribly exciting is going on. I could do some laundry or I could just sit here and veg all day. (I prefer the second option.) I should take a nap or something, but that involves moving. It's weird the things you miss when you're away from home. Our dorm room is set up in such a way that stretching out on the couch isn't really an option. Number one, we don't have a couch. Number two, if we did, it'd be really small and not worth laying on. Instead, I wish the TV was suspended from the ceiling so I could lay down on my bed and watch TV/sleep/whatever. *sigh*

Okay, enough dreaming about laying down. I just caught a wave of sleepiness, so I might just take a nap anyway."

That's about it, in a nutshell.


In other news, I've been doing really well in my Biology class -- surprisingly well, actually. I've made all A's thus far. \o/ I'm really bored. I think I'll give Marsha a call later. I think her grandparents are supposed to be leaving soon. Not sure when though. We're supposed to go watch Mr. and Mrs. Smith together!


I started reading the Harry Potter series again. You know, the last time I read them I think I was in a rush for some stupid reason and there are lots of things I didn't pick up on. Now that I spent my time reading them properly, I'm picking up all of the little things I missed or just sort overread. Anyway, the new book comes out July 16th and I'm really excited. Though, I was internet surfing yesterday after I got my internet back, and I came across the trailer for the new Harry Potter movie ""Goblet of Fire"" (and having just read it, I got really excited). 


Anyhoo, I'm really hungry, seeing as I just woke up. I'm going to migrate downstairs and find something to eat."

I get about five days off, then my US History class runs from Jun 27 to Jul 25. Yes, odd. It's sort of nice not to have two classes in the same day though. Because if I did, I'd be at Darton from 8AM to about 5PM and that would suck immensely.

Anyway, I like the Biology class so far. We've got lab first thing in the morning from Mon to Wed and then class for two and a half hours from Mon to Thurs. Anyway, I've got to run. Class class starts at 11AM and it's 10:30AM. *sigh*

"event","Well, graduation went off without a hitch and I can't be more excited. I didn't get emotional, but I did get really nervous before and really surreal feeling afterwards. As we sang the Alma Mater and then proceeded out of the tunnel, I could hear everyone cheering for us and the music was so appropriate and I got goosebumps. It was an amazing feeling.

Anyway, it's over and I'm really excited that high school is finally over. It still seems surreal because I catch myself thinking, ""Well, I'll see these people next year, so it's not that big of a deal..."" Guess what! I probably won't see most of these people ever again, not like I ever talked to them before, but still -- we've all shared Westover for four years so I feel like I have *SOME* bonds with these people...

Oh well.. It's exciting and surreal and slightly depressing all rolled into one intriguing emotion."

"event","Well, I graduate tomorrow and I'm really excited. I've been really emotionless until now and now the realization that we've moved onto this point in our lives is totally awesome. I don't want to go off on a tangent or anything, but I'm excited for the future -- for college, for summer, for future opportunities, for future challenges and everything. The fact that we're leaving high school seems almost surreal -- we've been there for four long years, through struggle and success, and now it's finally over. I don't think I'll cry tomorrow. I was scared Marsha's speech was going to be a tear-jerker, and while it's emotionally-filling, it's definitely not the cry-fest I was thinking it to be. Maybe when Ina does her closing remarks or when Pomp and Circumstance is blaring through the speakers as we march out, I'll start to cry or something.

I'm reading ""Forever Young"" by Bob Dylan as a poem tomorrow -- and I'm sort of nervous about that. The last time I had a speaking part in a program in front of other people, I sort of read ahead of myself and confumbled some words so it came out awkwardly. *shrug* I'll just read slow and say it was for dramatic effect. ;) I think the poem/song is really apropos for graduation and the prospects thereafter. I sort of had a feeling that this was what I wanted to read even before I researched the lyrics -- it deals with God, family, virtue, and everything a graduating high school student should know about. I'm looking forward to sharing it with my senior class, but I don't want to mess up. It's not that I'm scared to get up in front of people, I'm just scared of messing up.

Anyway, it's thundering in the distance and there was a storm to pass through here earlier, so maybe I should go. I'll try to update tomorrow before and after graduation, but there may be post-graduation festivities waiting for me. ;)

"event","I was thinking earlier about how totally awesome it would be to have a party. Of course that was two hours ago and I had just finished a Mountain Dew. But seriously, I was so in the mood to have a kickass party with all of my friends and other random people -- much like the Senior Party. Then I got to thinking about how we have all summer to party and live it up big-time. I was very content, but very impatient. I didn't want to wait -- I wanted it all to happen right now. But then I also realized that lots of people are probably just chilling out and all. Then I started to get sort of disappointed that I hadn't discovered how different life could be with a different mindset.

I would consider myself a much more open-minded person than I was last year at this time. I look back on things that I've said and done to people who were like I am right now and I regret saying or doing those things because it's rather hypocritical now. But ob-la-di, ob-la-da, right? Right. And now, I'm more determined than ever to be less judgemental and critical of people and their actions. Everyone needs a vent of some kind and some people's vents might be what some would be critical or judgemental about.

All I can say is that I'm definitely looking forward to the summer and the entire freshman experience again at Tech. The difference between college and high school is that in high school, you don't really have control over what happens to you. In college, you sort of choose your own fate. Much like those choose-your-own-ending storybooks I used to be so incredibly fond of. In college, the people you meet and associate with are your own choices -- not forced down your throat because you have to have every class with these people.


In closing, I could have really gone for some tequila shots with Marsha and Taylor earlier, but then I realized that the summer will hopefully be longer than most of us want. I don't really have any lengthy plans to be out of town and all, so it should be interesting to say the least."

Example:
Person: ""So I'm really torn up about this thing.""
Me: ""What thing?""
Person: ""Oh, never mind. Not that important.""


WHAT. THE. HELL. You got my attention. Now tell me what the fuck is going on. You OBVIOUSLY didn't make a statement like that with the intent to NOT tell me what is going on. And if you did, you need to have an anvil dropped on your head. Seriously people, don't ever do that to me.

"event","Today was my school's Annual Day -- and for those who can't figure out what that is, it's the day where we all get our yearbooks and get the first three periods off for signing and stuff. Lots of fun. Anyway, I got loads of people to sign my annual and I signed loads of annuals. It was lots of fun, as I said before. I didn't get sad really. I think I'm starting to become indifferent to the whole ""moving on"" thing. Most people were starting to well up and stuff at the thought of the future, but to me -- at least today -- it just seemed like every other Annual Day. I signed, people signed, I remembered... etc etc. I guess it just hasn't sunken in yet that this is the end of our high school days... *sigh* I'll probably be more of a wreck when graduation is over -- or maybe when Marsha gives her graduation speech. I have no idea.

Anyway, there's really nothing exciting to talk about. The insane busy crap from last week is completely the opposite this week. Finals are Thursday and Friday and I only have to take one exam! \o/ Physics. Stupid class. I really dislike that class. Not the teacher, not the people in it, just the work. It's so pointless and stupid. Oh well. School will be totally over in a few short days (aside from graduation practice and all that crap). 

Okay, enough writing. My hands hurt enough already as it is. Too much signing!

Peace out."

"event","Well, today I learned that one of my friends, Patrick, was in a car accident over the weekend. From what I've heard, he rolled down a ditch like four times, totalled his car, and was really close to being seriously hurt if not killed when he finally stopped rolling.

I couldn't imagine what that would feel like -- feeling so close to serious injury like that. The only time I've ever come close was in my accident and it didn't seem all that serious. It totalled my car and the front end looked really bad, but Alex and I walked away from it with no injuries. It just didn't seem that bad.

Anyway, I was scared for him until I talked to him. He says he's okay, but I know that after an experience like that, he must be really anxious and probably scared to get into a car again. I know I sure as hell was. 

It seems like it takes a blow to the senses and a reality shock to prove that we're all human and that we all make mistakes. Not saying that this was a bad mistake, but I'm sure he'll try to reach something on the floor of his car ever again, just like I will never not pay attention to the road while going really fast. Anyway, he says he's okay so I should believe him. I just can't help but think about how bad it could have been. If anything were to happen to any of my friends, I think I'd be a wreck for ages. I'm so emotionally attached to people like that... Maybe that's a bad thing. I didn't really want to ""spill my guts"", so to speak, but this is important.

I love each of my friends for different reasons. I won't go and list all the reasons why, but I do care about them and I couldn't imagine something terrible happening -- especially this close to the end of our senior year... I'm really glad that Patrick didn't get hurt. (For more than one reason.)

Anyway, Annual Day is tomorrow. Yay! I'm excited. It'll be much fun. First three periods of school spent in the Auditorium with music and people and signing and emotions and memories and laughter. What fun. \o/"

"event","Well, yesterday around this time I felt really badly. Really melancholy and sort of depressed, with a tinge of boredom. Then I slept and had a relatively good day today. Now, I feel like crap again. I dunno -- maybe it's the 8-9 hour or something. Bleh.

I've been listening to cheerful, upbeat music too, so it's not that that's causing my drastic mood swings. And it's not like I'm *THINKING* about anything in particular -- maybe it's just a smattering of lots of different psuedo-depressing things like college, friends, family, boys... etc etc. Anyway, I really wish my mood would make up it's mind. I'm happy and cheerful all day, and then this wave of shittiness sweeps over and I don't feel happy and stuff anymore.

In other news, Alex has a paintball tournament in a town about an hour south of here and I can't decide if I want to go or not. On the one hand, it might be a nice distraction from everything. But on the other, the more free time I have to think about things, the more distraught I'm liable to become. Also, if I go, I'm really cutting down on the time I have to get Mother's Day stuff. *sigh*

I need lots of distractions. We need to have another party soon. Albany is stifling with boredom. >.>

And there's another can of worms that I *COULD* open here and spill it all out, but I'll save that for a later entry. Besides, if I haven't told Marsha about it yet, then there's no way I'll spill my beans to a bunch of random people. :p Sorry.

"event","That exam seemed easy for the most part. Of course, I say that and I probably bombed the hell out of it.

Well, talk about a weird twist of fate. We were leaving the exam and we get a call from Taylor and she says that Patrick is having a cook-out at his house. We were already on our way to Wendy's, but I call Patrick and ask if that's the case. He says yes and invites us to come along. Fast forward to Patrick's house. We're sitting there minding our own business and some people arrive with alcohol. Now, normally, I wouldn't mind, but it's Thursday and it's the middle of the freakin' day. Silly people. Anyway, somehow Mark's dad finds out and he sort of instills fear into the hearts of many, so everyone sort of dispersed. We hang around for a few minutes while trying to figure out what the crap is going on... then my dad calls and tells me to leave ASAP. So I do. *shrug* I wasn't doing anything wrong.

I talked to my dad later and he seemed to be just scared that if someone had called the cops, we would all be lumped into one big ""Underage Drinking"" arrest. *sigh* The only people drinking were the guys that showed up with the beer. And even they hadn't even started properly yet...


Anyway, Marsha came over after her Biology class and we hung out for a while. We went to Target and I bought Fight Club with part of my giftcard that I got for my birthday. \o/ Yay for Brad Pitt in Fight Club! I &hearts; Tyler Durden.

By the way, I may obsess over school, but a certain person is obsessing over something -- in my eyes -- is kind of silly. I tried telling her that if you drink to the point of drunkeness, be expected to do and say stupid crap and not remember it. (Marsha, yes this is directed to you, sillyhead.) Stop obsessing and move on. No one else seems to be as embarrassed as you seem to be. :-p

Anyway, I *DO* have something worth obsessing over, but it's rather childish and I don't think I'll divulge any further. So, with that being said, wish me luck on my exam. Unlike the Calculus exam, I think I stand to have a fighting chance with this one! \o/"

Well after Katie's annoying obsessions over school (Boo!) my conversation should be a breath of fresh air. Actually not really. I'm obsessive too at the moment. We both are, sort of, about our respective experiences in the recent past (trying not to say too much) In short, it makes me very glad that high school is almost done and makes me never want to see some people ever again (not for bad reasons just that I'm horribly embarrassed) Katie's also obsessing about her shoulders which are peeling from a rather bad sunburn (ew!) But hey all troubles will be forgotten soon when we watch Snatch and Fight Club, both with eyefuls of Brad Pitt in his low rise pants...wait, what was I saying? The low rise pants thing made me forget. It's so much better to be in love with guys like Brad Pitt because there's absolutely no hope at all that you'll ever have any sort of interaction with him. Real people are another story. Interaction with them leaves so much room for so many unnecessary emotions, like obsessiveness (case in point). Anyway, enough for rambling. Back 2 KT"

Besides I think I can try to get one of the ""good"" professors at Tech for Calculus I. I'm going to take two classes at Darton this summer to hopefully decrease my workload -- probably Biology and American History or something (provided the credits will transfer over). So yeah.

Not much to say; working like crazy; I've got so many hours the store manager actually had to cut some. I hate it. Fast food sucks. I get nothing done at home.

Today was my first day off in a week; it was nice and got a piece done for a friend on DeviantArt. 

Still perfecting my drawing for FFCAM. 

I'll never get it right.

Been having mood swings that are unusual. Not healthy (mentally).

Saw Iron Man for the third time.

...Yeah. That's all. I've been drawing but no creative ideas for myself; I've been asking request a lot on dA.

Thanks for reading. See ya around."

"event","Hm... I decided two days ago when I posted on deviantart that I was&nbsp;dropping several projects&nbsp;just to&nbsp;clear my mind.
Like this one manga I was going to do (and&nbsp;have always wanted to do) was a group like our Manga Mages&nbsp;(...what manga mages...?) that&nbsp;would create a manga for a competition; then make a&nbsp;doujin and so&nbsp;on...

I dropped that and then got the idea to pick it up again; though instead of making it a 30 page story... I was&nbsp;thinking about 80-100 XD. Way too big to start out!

I don't think I'm going&nbsp;to do a&nbsp;Legend of Zelda spiff like I wanted to...

I've been drifting on the web to get some ideas but I kinda want to&nbsp;start out with small stuff and then move to larger projects; haven't been faring well with the one page comics (too long to tone... so little time T^T).&nbsp;

*Sigh* I don't know T^T

I have to be at work by 4:30 today... I'm gonna be there for 11 hours... I hate my life T^T&nbsp;"

I was banned from the intarweb&nbsp;(lol) for a week but not much has happened.Dyed my hair-&nbsp;black on the bottom. Didn't dye the top; it's&nbsp;still blonde. Looks pretty cool...
Um... Didn't do much for artwork *slashes wrists* though I got an idea for an anthology piece that I thought about doing during the summer. Stuff with random comics like I usually do and Dr.Wes (I'm totally taking ideas from the Dr. Wes comic&nbsp;we Mages were working on; like attacking the building&nbsp;and gaining experience...).
Howevar, I'm doing this solo (since there's no hope for the&nbsp;Mages and I would probably kill Wes if we worked together... no offense).
I'll probably do stuff tonight; my&nbsp;reign of going to bed&nbsp;early and waking early has been ruined thanks to Monster energy drinks. Well, I'm drinking&nbsp;Amp right now.

Yeah; not a whole lot on Thanksgiving. Just ate with the family that lives in the house and Jami and the kids... I also took Wyatt dinner because he had to work (though it was fast food because I didn't have anything to carry a home made meal in).&nbsp;Yeah...

But um... my spirits back... a little ^^. My typing skills are going downhill too, which really sucks. <br />I got paid today; half of it's gone (well, a third of it. I still had about $70 left from my last paycheck <img title="":P (Lick)"" height=""15"" alt="":P"" width=""15"" src=""http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/letters/=p.gif"" />). <br />Friday I'm putting Wyatt's Wii on layaway (cause I'm cheap like that...) and I have my dad's gift already (college football encyclopedia... something we'll both enjoy lol).<br />Kind of went shopping for myself too... spent money on food and gas for Wes and Corey (they're downstairs with Kevin right now; I thought I'd update cause when they leave I'm going to bed! It's sad I'm an early riser now... actually that's kind of good).<br /><br /><br /><br />Barnes &amp; Noble has black ink jars!!!!!!!!!! I bought two ^^<br />I also bought a new pair of jeans... I was due. All my good ones are torn (and my last good pair that I only had for a few months has a slit in the butt... my mom says too much Taco Johns T_T).<br />And I bought some shirts on sale... and vol. 3 of Absolute Boyfriend. I saw vol. 4 but I restrained myself (lol). So yeah...<br /><br />I leave you with a joke. Earlier my dad came downstairs to see what we were doing. Later I find out that my parents heard ""moaning"" from downstairs.... from the boys (probably Wes) complaining about loosing. That made me ""lol"". The thought of hearing moaning and Kevin and Corey being down there made me ""rofl"". <br />... te he he....<br /></p>"

"event","Not a whole lot going on; I have a subway sandwich sitting right in front of me (yum!).&nbsp;
That comic with Naruto and Sasuke got a lot of attention on MyOtaku.com (I'm not loved at dA! Wyuuuh!). Out of the 70 comments, there were only 3 negative comments. I'm just glad it got a really good response (and the ones who flamed, I don't really care; I just laughed). I didn't say anything to them because since I had the right to express myself with the comic, they had a right to comment.&nbsp;

Oh well :P at least I'm not being emo and taking a positive outlook on things ( still got church in my head from this morning; that's good).&nbsp;

I've got a bunch of comic ideas in my head; the biggest one involves me, Wyatt, Khalid and Becca (won't say though ;P).&nbsp; I also have a photoshop piece I want to finish with one of my original characters. But I don't have time; I didn't get off of work last night until around 3 (didn't get home til 3:30...). And I have to work in 3 hours...
( I have tomorrow off!!! Though I'm probably spending it with Wyatt!...)

Yep yep yep... I'm not doing that Rising Stars of Manga (urgh!). There's just too little time and I'm not ready to go pro yet; especially if I have a hard time fleshing ideas out on paper. Though Wes Wyatt and I are doing the ""blackout manga.
The first page with have a scene of a guy who is surrounded by a whole bunch of thugs, and gets into a fight. Very detailed; unti about the second page the guy is hit and blackouts. The ENTIRE manga then has black panels; to signify that he has blacked out; though the panels are formed to where it looks like something's going on. Then on the last page, he wakes up and says, ""Oh, I blacked out."" We're only sending this in for ROFLs and LMAOs. (lol)
We're sending it in under a false name, too. I wanted to use Wes Lee Roth but Wes doesn't... that commie..."

"event","I actually started scripting my manga; though it was at work (lol). Hey, at least I'm getting somewhere now.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;only a page long on a 3""x5"" but&nbsp;applied to manga pages I should have about... 3 pages. W00T. I feel that it's really fast paced so far (I feel that the whole thing is going to be fast paced and rushed). It's a comedy/drama... not so much drama though...
I've been drawing a lot more; I went on a frenzy around 5 a.m. yesterday. I updated them on deviantart but they're scraps; except my Emily one (which I'm actually rather fond of; I hope&nbsp;it was alright to&nbsp;post on the&nbsp;Dramacon community website). I can't stay up too late; I&nbsp;have church (and there's no way I'm pulling an allnighter; especially with daylight savings time). Then I get to work tomorrow (but I'm&nbsp;off on Monday!).&nbsp;
Hopefully I&nbsp;can get stuff done. Heh.&nbsp;



And I'm back on Myspace... only for networking though. Thought that once i get my comic done I can promote it there; with all it's popularity... something tells me I'll regret it though... *wyuuh*"

Yeah, not a lot going on right now. I guess you can say I'm taking a break from working on manga, though i can't find any time or I don't make time (I usually need about 10 hours of sleep... *laugh*. But seriously, I do...). I'm trying to do a 40 page manga. It was going to be 20 pages but the story expanded... they all usually do. *sigh*
I thought about just doing a couple scenes; working on a scene that lasted one page so I could get the feel of inking, toning, page layout, then go to two, three pages... just slowly start out. I just don't have time... Lately for the past MONTH I've been concerned with scripting... maybe I should be doing that instead of typing on here... I don't get on the internet that much though *laugh*. I'll find a way. I hate my computer/ piece of crap. I REALLY need a tablet... I have a job but Christmas is coming up!!! AUGH!!!

I also want to practice my artwork so it's not really shojo like... so Wes may have a point in the marvel (there's this really cool artist from dA; she's so awesome...). But I'm making a list of art to draw; I'm tired, hungry, strained, homesick; I really want to see Wyatt... We leave tomorrow (meaning my all access of internet will be GONE), but I don't know what time.

And Becca, I lied about the art tables.... they're about $50. But that's Anime Nebraskon, which I couldn't get much information from anyways. 
Katsucon officially starts on my birthday next year... that totally kicks ass.

As for manga ideas, I'm still working on my aspiring manga work (with the group like the Manga Mages). I do want to start another project called The Ultamite Anime project; something I was going to start with Wes and Wyatt. I will eventually; when I'm able to contact them (my cell phone doesn't work out here in Kansas). It'll be fun because we get to parody anime, and we'll have Dr. Wes in the comics as well (since his sole mission is to destroy the world of anime). I do want the group to be larger; and people we can meet up with to (and I want Cameron on the team... I don't know how many times I have said that). I was going to come up with a bunch of ideas and make a proboards message board, but I haven't confirmed anything yet until I actually contact people... damn you, Cricket. I was going to jump on first impulse but I had just recently deleted the Manga Mages Message board because their were only three members with 2 members updating sometimes, and it hasn't been touched since November. So if anybody is interested (the only requirement is that you have a love/hate passion for anime and manga, and I have to have met you in real life and you live in the general area of... you know where. Omaha is fine to if you can check the message boards frequently). But this is just an idea. That I want to make work. Really really bad. lol

Well, I'm gonna go to bed. Kevin's a lying jerk and I have NO PEPSI around. In fact there's nothing with caffeine. And we're in the middle of the rural country so I can't exactly walk out and get my fix. Unless I wanted to get picked up 6 miles away from the house... maybe take a goat with me... I'll elaborate later.

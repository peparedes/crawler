"event","I work. A lot. Sometimes forty hours a week, more often much, much more. When you work as much in three days as most people do in a whole week, good sense would have it that you should have some license to complain about it. So, here I am, true to form, complaining. In half an hour, I'll go home, sleep for six hours, and head back to the less bearable (but more social) of my two jobs. 
There aren't very many suitable excuses for posting in this thing six times in as many months. I'm online for hours and hours a day, moreso when I'm at work, as I am at this moment. The only real reason is that I refuse to believe there is a contingent of people out there awaiting the next installment of banality. There are some sweet kids out there (Andrea!) whom I don't speak with often, and it flatters me when they notice I'm actually using this thing. 
Guess what? I get to see Beth again soon. Maybe it would make more sense if I mentioned that I've been to see her before, but, hey.
I have to run, like this moment."

"event","Shit fire. I haven't posted in four months, an' it do ya fine. At the beginning of this, I wrote a lot about making this journal part of my daily routine, and failed. Sometimes it's just hard to find anything to say. Other times, the things you want or need to say aren't suited for public exhibition. 
I am sick in my tummy. My skin feels like someone else's, a smaller person's skin, maybe, and I'm sweating just sitting here. Hangovers suck, vodka hangovers even more so.
Alcohol consumed by me in the past twenty four hours:

Svedka Vodka. A Swedish import. Fairly smooth. Not bad.
Smirnoff Vodka. Not much to be said of this one.
Guinness Draught. I'd prefer extra stout, actually.
Honey Brown. Cheap and still good.
Saranac Black & Tan. Good, when you can afford it.
Bell's Batch 6,000. Some sort of commemorative beer from this small brewing company. It was good, I think.

I am going to work, now, to toil, sweaty and miserable, in a greenhouse, which will make me more sweaty and miserable. Perhaps when I return, I'll be fresher, or at least more lucid, and I'll post something of relevance. Or maybe I'll just post something."

"event","A friend of mine told me recently that having a Live Journal is totally 'scene.' Seen, I asked? No, he replied, SCENE. Which scene, I asked? THE scene, he said. 

After a few more minutes that sounded like a bad Abbot and Costello bit, I came to the realization that he meant the 'indie scene,' as, apparently, many 'scenesters' keep LJs. I had no idea this was a refuge for the geek glasses and workshirt subset; I thought it was more for unsociable miscreants like myself. Who knew? Having a Live Journal is somehow hep, though probably not as much as Blurty or some other, newer journal-hosting site I've yet to hear of. I find this a bit hard to swallow, since I know I'm pretty fucking far from hep, and I likes it that way. Just because the music I listen to doesn't suck total ass, this makes me a scenester? Surely not. I might be self-righteous and lazy, but I'm no goddamn hippie, either. 

So, I've neglected this thing for nigh on three weeks. What's the point of having a journal if you're not going to use it? Not that there's been much to report. There was a party last weekend, and it was good. Two half barrels of Honey Brown, and we didn't even touch the pony of Bud Light. There was a point, later on in the evening, at which I knew maybe four of the people in my line of sight. It was a pretty interesting mix of folks, I guess, and nothing was broken. The sink received a bit of vomitous at some point during the night, but other than that it all went swimmingly. I made a half-hearted, drunken attempt at playing matchmaker (which is probably giving myself too much credit, as I didn't know whether one half of the 'match' was romantically involved or not, and the 'making' consisted of me giving a slurred suggestion and a nudge in the ribs). I hung out most of the night with one of my favorite couples, two people I very seldomly see. John and Tiffany. John's record release party is tonight in Lancaster, but I don't think I'll be in attendance. That fake ID I have might work for picking up a case of Busch here or there, but I'm reluctant to give it a test run at one of the most fascist beer halls in town. Mayhap I'm due for a nice night at home, reading and vegging and doing nothing. 

Eh.

"event","I just finished reorganizing my music collection. It's started to take the better part of two hours, especially after putting it off for a few weeks, when there's a dozen or more titles to be added. It wouldn't take so ungodly long, if it weren't for the crappy media storage units I'm using. They're plastic cabinets, holding 60 discs apiece, and each disc has its own individual little slot for the jewel case, so each must be removed and added one at a time. Tedious, to say the least. Standing back, looking at all the jewel cases in various piles, it really gives me an idea of just how much money I've spent on CDs in the past two years. A fucking lot, to say the least. God knows, god knows. I don't keep the receipts. I don't regret buying any of them, though (except for a few things, like the newest Michael Franti, which, contrary to popular opinion, is not good). There are more fleeting things to spend money on. 
                  I've tomorrow off, which is nice. A weekday from time to time, a Tuesday or a Wednesday to chill out, regroup, recharge. Good for what ails ya, especially if what ails ya is the ceaseless, grinding, empty routine of daily life. I'm sure I'll spend it less than productively. Start a new book, maybe. Finish reading <u>Revolution and the State</u> for the third time. It's hard to say, god knows, god knows.
                  I'm not sure why I felt compelled to add to this right now. I'm trying to do it more often, I suppose, but I don't have much to say at the moment. I think I'll just put some lyrics here and call it a post. It works at Ani-D.net alla time.

Rich Wife Full of Happiness (w. oldham)

All in all is one thing today
One good effort made on its way
To take in a love and pass on a feeling
Of heart in chest slowly unpeeling

Lily can take it with a smile and not a frown
In the room where she lives, blessed I guess
She wears my favor and shows it around
And in doing so I too get blessed

Rules explode and we call her mine
And she has my baby and things are fine
She can't hold her eyes still or her voice
The way nooses hold necks in excellent poise

Lily can take it with a smile and not a frown
In the room where she lives, blessed I guess
She wears my favor and shows it around
And in doing so I too get blessed

Jug holds a gallon and you hold my arm
I hold a million in bottle and yarn
And gem isn't sacred where mother has breathed
You know you told me that

A shark and a god-- and now you're laughing
The dog licks the shark dry and you're photographing
I lick you dry until you're laughing
My fingers in your behind

I woke up fat
And almost unhappy
But the bigger the laugh
The bigger the belly
And I bellow out and the whole bed shakes
And you smile at my laugh as it rocks you awake"

"event","And so I stood there, watching the pretty thin blonde girl and hating her. Eyes that look made up even when they're not flitted up, sensing my gaze. Her eyes met mine for a moment and slipped off in less than a second, dismissive. I kept watching.
Her boyfriend, or at least the man with her at the time, was a tall guy, crusty blonde with a ragged sweater. They both wore Hush Puppies. Her jeans, some designer brand I couldn't place, were smeared with twenty different shades of paint, and her denim purse had a similar motif. Not the sort of smears that appear after long hours spent in a studio or on a ladder with brush in hand: She had obviously put them there, meticulously and carefully. There were other kids at the gallery opening with paint on their paints, an errant smudge on a knee or a brown-colored spot on the thigh, above the holes wore through by their pockets. This girl, though, this girl had seen the paint-spattered masses of art students and decided it easier to simply touch up her own clothing, smear after smear, as if trying to one-up those whose work had stained them. Her face, clear as noon in August, shone a bit under the harsh studio lighting, her teeth flashed when she smiled and laughed. She did both continuously. She wore an expensive t-shirt made to look cheap, and a corduroy overshirt. Bohemian chic. Terrible.
My friend, who works two jobs to put herself through school and has one piece in tonight's showing, leans in and rasps ""Her parents drive a Bentley.""
I nod. I thought it was implied.
This girl is standing in front of a piece of blank canvas, her chin cupped in her hand, staring at it with severe, almost insane interest. She turns to Crusty Blonde, says something. He nods furiously, says something back. I know I'd vomit if I heard them.
There are at least thirty other people like this girl, scratch that, that ARE this girl, milling around, going on an on at their self-serving prattle, showing everyone and themselves how smart they truly are. They're all wearing stylishly beat-up designer clothing. They're all undergraduate art students.
On the way out, I spit on the blank canvas, and I'm pretty sure she sees me."

Would you please

Would you

And that's, well, that's good news for anyone who loves bad news. I do have to go to work, now, though I'm also seriously considering calling off today and doing some stuff that I've been putting off for far too long, like filing my taxes and mailing some bills. Aren't you glad this journal is here, so you have a window into the excitement that is my life? Sure you are."

---
There's a woman I see at a bar that's near me
And she catches my eye repeatedly
And so it's one evening I wait until four
When the bar turns its lights out and closes the door

And then I may follow her cautiously home
Where she would go walking or stumbling alone
And I can't help but want to see her at her window
And to want to approach her and stand just below

And I needed so much to have nothing to touch
And I wanted so dear to have nothing so near
To render the city unbounded and pretty
So to slip in and out of her
Then to slip off

Goodbye to the city, goodbye to the girl
Her room is left standing,
Her room is my world
And in it she slips into bed without thinking
And I follow closely, for I have been drinking"

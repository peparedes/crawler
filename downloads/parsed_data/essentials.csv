i asked one girl at my job if i could work for her because i knew she had a boyfriend and i didnt have anything better to do.. plus, i needed money. i worked with shakira anyway so we had fun.

stephanie got me this cute card. iloveit! 
she didnt want to seem gay, so she didnt sign it, which is gay, but whatever.
if you dont get it.. my last name is squirrel. :D

"event","<p align=""justify""><b>snow day!</b> i dont exactly understand why we're having a snow day because the snow stopped saturday night/sunday morning.

i really could have sworn we had school today, to the point where i showered, got dressed and waited at the busstop. i was actually up there thinking i might have even missed it (since i never ride it, im not sure what time it comes). nobody hit me up last night or this morning to inform me. hmph

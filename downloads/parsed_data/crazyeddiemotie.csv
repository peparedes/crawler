"event","We did some brainstorming in English the other day and i wanted to write it down.


1. What do I know?
      I know where I want to go:travel-home-safety. I know who I am. I know what i want:life-learning-love.  ""All i know is that i know nothing""

2. What do i like to do?
      I like to Backpack. I like to be alone with myself every now and then. I like to experiece new things with loved ones. I like to share life with a certain Miss Laura Owen. 

3. Waht Do I use?
     I use money to help me get places and do things. I use words to get meaning across. I use my mind to help steer me. 

4. What do I consume? 
   I consume food to eat, gas to go places, and books to feed my brain.

5. what do I read? Anything in English

6. What have I made? 
        Ceramics. songs, stories. I have worked hard at and built a good realaitonship with Laura. 

7. What have I failed at? 
        Languages. No matter how i try, languages are hard to learn for me. this question was hard, because we tend to push out our failings with our sucesses and not remember them. I'm sure there are more things, I just can't remember them.

8. What have I done well?
       Recognizing myself. knowign how to see certain emotions and cooly analyze them.  ""know thyself"" and all that. I have a way to go, but i'm doing better.


It was cool. I liked it. We are supposed to write about a certain topic an dmake a claim about it. I think i am going to choose backpacking. even though i haven't done it in about three years, I still love it."

     Darius Grey leaned back and watched as the crew milled around the deck, performing a dozed tasks a minuite, all essential. 
   ""hooks planted,captain.""
  ""good, raise thrust to two hundred rev's per second, lets get this screep movign so we can get off this shift. Jimmy, i want those safety booster's ready to go so we won't have to go chasing after that screep if it breaks loose.""
   ""sure boss, it's all taken care of.""
  the ship inched forward and paused, hangign ponderously in space. behind it, dragging forward, moves a shredded hull, tired and worn. 
    ""rockets in place?""
  ""in place and ready, captain.""
 ""good, start the main drive and let's go drop this space junk off at the recycling plant. them let's all hit the showers. after being in space for a week with you louses, everythign smells too much like people.""
  deep in the ship rumblings start and explode backwards, sending a blue cone of flame out into the jet black. Riding the blue flame,the ship incrfeases speed towards the blue ball of planet Earth, where a floatign space factory will take their tired, broken cargo and rebuild it into a space yacht ot a transport ship or any number of reincarnati0ons. 
    the rumbligns in the ship trail off as they get closer to port. hooks and wired disengage, and the old hull tumblies slowly into it's first step towards rebirth. 
  ""salvage was sucessful captain, the spectroanalyzr results show twenty percent steel, 37 percent nickel alloy, some traces of gold...."" 
  but the captain wasn't listnening. his eyes were outside the ship, looking down at the blue marble that gently curvd away from him, quietly restign on a diamond studded bolt of velvet. 
    ""captain?""
  ""file whatever is necessary."" his voice was as tired adn as broken as the shipthey had just dragged in. ""brignthe final drafts to my quarters to sign. i'll be leavign in  half rotation."" the captain of fourty seven years looked around the deck of his ship. ""thank you , gentlemen, that will be all for now.""
   the young crewman stared confused at the captains retreatign back. ""why woudl he say somethign liek that?"" 
   an older man, one who had been with the captain since thy first began, understood. "" hell of a living, picking up garbage like this."" he turned to the young crewman. ""you know, thi buisnes has sure grown since the captain started it with just his single ship and towline. But, i guess there's just more screeps up here these days. more garbage. i th8ink the capatin was just dissapointed that there wasn't an acident that let him stay up here longer.""
  ""but draggin hulls around can't be that great of a job, why did he do it?""
    for that the other man had no answer. 

    Darius grey resented the people on the ground, resented their kind words an helpful gestures. in spacehe was a captain, a man of importance. Down onth solid earth he was just another retiree, required by law not to work in anything dangerous or resourceful. nwo that the welfare state had evolved into a self sufficent machine, Captain Darius Grey was able to , wheather he liek it or not, sit in his house allday and get letter's fromhis nephew who wa in college. that and drink.

"event","Forty years after the Collapse the appalacian mountains had become the appalacian desert. thirst blew dustily into each town after the next, covering the starvign childeren with looks of desperatin and fear. the childeren swallowed the clouds o thirst and it choked them and shriveled them,making thier lips become dusty and crumbled, making thier eyes bright with need for liquid. there wwre stories of people dying, with cups full of gasoline adn parrafin raised to their lips, which were cheaper thn water and would soothe the split lips of men driven insane withthirst. of course, help came. the local strongmen would ship water to thier comrads in arms two towns over, and wars beganto break out over water rights and blood stained the ground a thick red where men died over the handful of well sleft that were not polluted. the slave trade sprng up again, and flourished. thirst had become real and walked among the people. anythign was now trade for water. houses, clothing, rubies, diamonds. bodies. 
     but this was merely the appalacian desert. elswhere it was worse. places where there were weapons left, it had become truly horrible. 
   a small coaalition of men and woemen had commandeered the last remaining space vessel, a museum peace that had been preserved for posterity. pantign with thirst and desperation, they pushed buttons and pulled levers until they rode to the sky on a pillar of fire, leaving behind the smoldering ruin of a hall of knowledge, burned down by thirst. 
   the vessel rose up, the men trappped inside screaming as their lips peeled adn their tounges dried, into the sky, until they were a pinpoint of light, briefly flashing throught the night. a casual observer onthe ground might have noticed the new star movign slowly across the deep velvet night. But on earth vampires had become real again, and childerens nightmares walked the streets with bloody knives and gallon jugs full of soupy redness. 
       the tiy pinprick of light was noticed, however, by the last remaining Spinsat, a lone puppy endlessly chasing its tail around a blue marble in space. the station let out puffs of steam,changing course until it matched veliciteis with the ancient human transport the coalition stole.reportedly the first words communicated bewteenships were ""we al have skills we are all engineers.  water,please. water or death.""
   the station's commnaders were quick tomake a descision. ""send over five of your best engineers, each one havigna different area of expertise, to validate yoru claim.""
    so five were sent. among them were Elena Anlai and Hans Viefo, the former biomedical, the latter mechanical. they are the main cahrachters of our story. 
   so the five were led through a gossamer thread of shutlletube into the main airlock of the Spinsat. there they were tested in their knowledge, and after being pronounced good engineerrs, the shuttletube wa disconnected and the station powere up its defensive grid. the five tried in vain to stop what was about to happen, but could only watch in agony as the port guns blew a hole in thier desperatetly stolen ship. twent-three bodies blew out of the hole, writhing as the gases boiled out of their skin into space and death came to release them. 
    the five left,the ones that lookked on as their frineds floated away to burn up in the atmosphere, wewre each given jobs that suited their educations.and, because they had to cope with the shock of leaving their homes and watchign their friends die, they threw themselves into their work until the staion ran better than before. But when they floated past each other in the halltubes, ther eyes woudl meet, and there would pass between them looks that told of secret revnge, of hidden desires. 
   our story begins with Elena Anlai and Hans Viefo, nine months after the Massacre. 
                                                     ***

    ""hans, pass me the YeaSteak.""
Elena Anlai speadred a oval mass of burned protein that looked like it's creator wanted it to look like it came from a cow an dchewed thoughtfully, her face souring as the taste hit her. Hans ate his in silence, apparently it had not been a very palatable morning for him, either. 
     ""So, how are the recyclers coming along?""
Hans did nto answer, his face tuned inward, thinking deep. 
    "" I guess they must really be workign you hard over in Reclamation, huh?""
Hans loo0ked at her when she said this, his eyes iced over. 
   ""theres a problem with Reclamation.""
""what?""
  ""The nanobot's are programmed to break down and seperate out the different particles for everythign that come in. We can recycle ev erythign from shirts to silverware as long as we tell the bots how to do it. But there's a glitch.Now the nanobots are composting the wrong stuff. And some of them broke out of containment two days ago.  they are startign to eat on the walls of the hull, or anytrhing else that is meatl. we coudl always order them to self detruct, but once we make them break themselves down, we won't be able to stop the chain reaction. all of them, eventhe ones that are behiving, will break down.  then we will be back to jettisonning out all our wastes liek we do our sewage. Won't that be a pleasent prospect when we need nitrogen and iorn.""
     ""how long do we have?""
    ""they say about two weeks. i say about one. if we don't do something soon, there is goign to be an ever growinghole in our hull th we can't patch with anythign the 'Bots won't eat throught.""
   Elena looked down at ther food,the product of yeast vat's deep within the guts of the station. ""at least it would help if the food here tasted better. ""
  Hans followed her eyes. ""the food tastes liek crap. Hell, we could reprogram the bots to composthe hull into edible bars, that way we wouldn't die of starvation."" he gave a weak smile. 
    But Elena lit up. ""Han's, did you say you could make the 'Bots turn metal into foodstuffs?""
 ""well, just the trace elements, like iorn and magnesium and the random proteins that are foatign around in the air. mix it together, and you would get a little chunk of grade A yum. its pointless, but so is waitign to be sucked out of a bereach in the hull.""
     ""we're not going ot be sucked out of the hull. "" Elena grinned sudedenly, an idea sparkling behind her eyes. ""meet me at my bunk when you get off the shift with a plastic container of your little buggers that are chewing up the hull. And make sure you have somethign that you can reprogram them with on hand."" 
   Hans' eyes lost some of their frost and widened with curiosity.'what are you geting at?""
""not here. in my bunk.""
                                       ***
Downstairs, on earth, the reamining peasents started to make up sun gods and mood goddesses. and along with them came the age old ritual of live sacrifice for rain. even if the rain glowed when it hit the ground and made people sick and stunted when they drank it. 
                                     ***

Elena's bunk was sparse, a few growing plants under flourescent lights and the few pictures she had in her pockets of her loved ones back on earth when she crossed over. other than that, a table, and a gelbed, the walls were bare grey and functional. Hans enterd with a tiny opaque vial that looked to have a greyish mass in it. the mass was constantly trying to move up the wall of the vial,and it always was speckled with glitterign movment. Elena opened the door and quickly hushed himinside. 
    "" Did anyone follow you?""
  ""no, qnd if they did , it woudl just seem like we were-""
   ""Ok,good. whee is your reprogrammer?""
Hans lifted up a tiny object that looked liek a laser pointer. ""all i need is a comuter terminal and a keyboard.""
 While han's busyed himself settignup the reprogrammer, Elena went to a cubbyhole and pulled out a plastic cube that held something inside which m,oved very slowly, and according to the way the cube tilted. Hans noticed it in her hand and his mouth opened to ask a question, but Elena cut him off.
        "" here"" she held out a set of tiny plugs to the man across fromher, and delicately placed her own paitr of foam plugs in her nostrils. 'check to make sure you can still breathe trought them.""
    ""what do we need nose filters for?"" Hans was beginningto look at the box she held inher hand with more curiosity. 
     ""because when the smell hits you don't wat to be breathgin it in. ok, do you have tha programmer set up?""
    "" yeah""
   ""tell it to reprogram the 'bot's to make a food bar. consitency of a bar of chocolate. and make it taste like oarnges. can they do that?""
   ""what color do you want?""
  ""Uh, oarnge, i guess.""
  ""it will take some time.""
  ""while you ae workign on it,explain why your bot's can do this.""
  ""well,they are really very simple. you see, each bot is either a catalyzer of certain nucleotides or a empathizer that reactw with the protease sequence=""
  'english, please. ""
 sigh ""ok, there are two stages to a bot's life, one stage where it breaks down stuff, another when it puts stuff together. the stuff i'm talking about is molecules, atoms, and the lieks thereof. what this programmer does is tell the bot's what the end product must be. Each bot then starts out as a destroyer, hunting out molecules that can be used to make you food bar and breaking them from whatever they are holding onto. there is a special bot in every batch that is more advanced than the others, and without borign ou to death, it knows when to start putting together the food bar. so it starts changing one bot into a builder, then tey both change two more, than four, then sixteen, and then, after some hight tech building of molecules, you have an oarnge food ar that tastes like tangerines. all the stuff that wasn't neede to make the food bar will be discarded in a neat pile on one side of the cube, while the bots will congregate onthe other side in a nice little mound. Funyy,thought, we never did think of changing wastes into food products, just kept throwing our food overboard and rely on our yeast."" Hans stood after wiping his brow.
  ""why tangerines?""
 ""closest ths thing comes to oarnges. with the Reclamation computer,i could make a chocolate cake with frosting."" He eyed the white container that she held in her hand. ""now tell me what i am transforming. ""
   ""something close enought to chocolate. one tiny difference where it comes from, thoguth.""
Hans looked at her nose filters, then at the mass inthe box. 
  ""seriously?""
   ""yep, comeon, genius, what could it harm?""
   ""but that's disgusting! that's not even been sterilized!""
   'bacteria and viruses are organic, right?""
    ""yeah.""
   ""so won't they be broken down to make out little food bar? unless you set the Bot's to include viruses.""
  a tinge of green was forming around hans' lips. ""I still woulnt eat it,though.""
  ""look a tit this way, second times the charm. heck, maybe third or fourth time could be the charm with my metabolism. Comeon, are we breaking any rules or anything?""
    ""you don't have to break rules to have an accidentally frayed tug line next tiem you do a walk Outside.""
   Elena tuned serious. ""please, Hans""
    his eyes iced over briefly, then warmed.
    ""all right. one sec."" he held the vial up to the laser pointer, pressed one side, and it's opaque surface became clear. a thin red light pulsed over the movign grye mass within, and Elena swore it nodded after the light stopped. 
""open the cube, and be prepared to close it.""
  she started to pry up one corner of the airtight seal which opened only to her touch. hans unscrewed the vial's opening and motioned to her to open the box all the way. she did, and the smell started driftign throght the filter, causingher to gag. hans tilted the vial, and the glittering mass of grey extended a pseudopod and flowe out of the bottle into the box, after which she slammed down the top in relief. 
    ""well now, that wasn't so bad, was it?""
hans looked doubtful. ""it will take about adnhour to transforma mass that big. don't expect any miracles.""  He sat down ona projection from the wall that served as a chair. ""you might as well sit , too, elena.""
  she sat, and togethr the stared as the shadows inthe box held steady, then shifted raplidly into moving pieces of dark as the Bot's did their work. 
                                   ***
Hundeds of miles below, a child, tattered and filthy, streaked with grey ashes that no number of baths cold erase, roamed the streets of old Atlanta, now mostly bomb crater. Somewhere, it new, there was water. the child could smell it on the wind,coming from the direction of an old house that had been gutted by fire until only pipes and a few brick walls remained. the childs feet, bare of any coverings, were hard and twisted after years of walkingwithout shoes. nevertheless, it was careful as it picked its way across the sharp bricks and broken pipes. the child, which could have been male, rubbed its grey nose adn sniffed, its face turned up liek a dog's tha finds a smell it likes on the wind."" it's little hands clenchd into fists with excitement. thsi woudl mean survival. if it was a welll, it could mean survival with soem semblance of life. he twisted his head around the last remaining wall and looked, tingling with expectation, his dry mouth crying for water. 
       another child looked back at him, tattered as well. this one could be called a girl if she could have the chance to eat regular meals and drink water that was not infested. fear welled inher eyes as the boy approached, his hard feet making no sound onthe burned floor. he stopped several feet away from her, looking. 
     ""hello"" the boy was one of the few lucky ones who had been taught speech.
the girl did not answer. her hand fell suddenly into a holein the ground and the boy feared she might pull a weapon, but instead it came up dripping, and she reached out with a handful of blissful clear water. the boy drank with such haste that he spilled some of it down his rags, which he sucked at greedily. he looked up at the rapidly purpling sky and motione to the feeble creature beside him.
   ""rain soon. roof or stupid.' the boy undserstood that those who enjoyed the oddly lit rainwater woudl soon become feeble and die faster. he grabbed the girls hand and pulled her under a section of he roof that had not fallen down. the girl pulled away,however,and grabbed for a dented cone of metal thta served as a bucket, went to the spring, and came back with cool water. 
    and so they sat, watching the rain begin to fall, pulling their hands and feet inside so that it would not touch them. slowly, their hand smoved toward, each other, adn the two huddled, hand in hand, watchign death fall from the sky onto theri burned adn wailing world. 
           ***

""it's crap, right?""
commander Bune looked down at the tiny bar in his hands and tried his best to look intersted. 
   Hans shot a look at Elena and tried to explain. ""yes, it is feces, but its allthe right parts that our body didn't-""
""feces. crap. you think i would liek to eat this, knowign where it came from?""
 Elena, tierd of the bickering,took the bar from Bune and bit off a piece, chewed, and swallowed. Bune's lips began to grow pale and he gulped down his rising stomach.
  ""miss Anlai, hwo could you?""
 She finished cooly and began to speak. ""it's really quite good, and there is suprisingly little waste.""
  The commander began to turn a normal color again. ""how can you eat that,knowing where it came from?""
She looked down at the half-eaten bar in her hands. ""the Bots break down every particel before they reform them the bacteria as well. they are organic materiel, so everythgin goes into the making of this bar. even big molecules that our body couldn't use or thought was waste can be reprocessed adn broken down by the Bots so that we can reuse them.""
 Bune still looked revolted. 'but it's crap! literally! you don't thikn i will be telling hte men this, doyou? Besides, you wil need to apply for a patent and get those things tested before you can try selling them."" he walkd around the protrusion from the hull that served him as a desk. ""one more thing."" his eyes darkened ""don't think tht because you are engineers that you can tell us what to eat and what to do here. you guys were the lucky ones, the ones tha we decided to let live."" he was now only inches from Elena's face, she cold smell his breath, which reeeked due to the water and toothpaste rationing. ""don't forget that we are the ones on top here, not you.""
  Hans was motioning behind Bune's head, telling her to shut up and just take the slap on the wrist. Elena pretended liek she din't see him. ""but sir, with this we coudl even start recycling water from our urine! we coudl release small teams of bots to scour the ship for our dead skin cells and convet those to food. we could -""
     The commander spun around and pressed a smallbutton onhis ComLink. ""Daniels, get in here!""   
a small man who looked to be in his thirties stepped inside the now crowded office. Bune lifted up the food bar and handed it to him. ""Daniels, i want you to eat this.""
    the man took a small bite and moused it, his eyes curious. ""what is this , sir?""
  the commander pointed at Elena 'it is made from that woman's crap.'
Daniels looked at Elena, looked at the bar, and vomited. 
                                                  ***
the boy watched the girl huntign and tried to imitate her. the deadly rains had stopped, and the glowing pools had al sunken intothe earth. the boy's stomach was rising every now and then, but he pushed it back down adn concentrated on the hunt. The girl was ahead of him, sneaking around  a small animal, probably a rabbit,inthe hopes of catching it. the bushes were barely hangin on to lie here, and what animals were here always moved too slow and gave too little meat. but ths one was a winner. they had seen the rabbit earlier and their mouths had watered as they thought of tasting it's flesh. so the girl, the more experienced hunter,went after it,motioning at the boy to watch and learn. 
   The bush that the rabit hid in twitched adn the girl froze in place, her ridged back barely risign with her slow breathing. she took another cautious step, cracked a twig, and suddenly the bush exploded in a shower of dead leaves adn the rabbit was running away withthe girl in hot pursiut. the boy knew that the girl was too slow,though. Maybe she coudl have a chance if hse had been well fed. but the rabbit veered to the left, a blur of grey onthe smoky ground, and there it was between them, the girl pantign hard,a suprised look in her eyes. the rabbit headged its way over, trying to get between the circling children. But the boy and the girl hemmed it in, stepping quietly as the got closer and closer, strangling the rabbits means of escape. the rabbit stopped hedging,laid its ears back. its eyes trieed to look everywhere at once, overflowign with fear. it's nose twitched. the boy hefted a rock. took aim. 
                           ***

 Elena caught up with Commnader Bune just as he was walkign out. ""commander, wait!""
Bune tuned and started at her hard. ""doyou want me to cut your water rations in half? what does it take to get rid of you?""
  Elena leaned against the side of the door, turning her hips outward and lowering her voice to a throaty whisper. ""i just thought you might like to discuss this in a more private setting. maybe in my cubby over dinner?"" she looked up at him with a small smile onher face. 
  the commnader looked her up and down, his eyes never meetign hers. ""two revs, 2100 hours. wear something..."" hi svoice trailed off as he kept looking ""...appropriate.' he uttered a small laugh and walked away, never once looking at her face. 
 she turned to meet Hans' glare. ""come on, we need to get to work.""
 he grabbed her arm and spun her around ""what the Hell do you think you are doing? Whose sdie are you on?""
    She met his eyes, her own now iced over with determination. ""hans, if you released those Bots onto a person with the same programming, what would they do?""
     He looked sick. ""they woudl tear him to peices.you couldn't stop the chair reaction until their timers went off.'
Elena flashed her teeth in a grin that was devoid of any mirth. ""then let's give the Commander a dinner to die for.""
                       ***

and threw. the rock sailed through the air and crunched into the rabbit's leg, a red fan of arterial blood spraying out into the air. it was amazing how much blood such small animals held in them. the rabbit struggled to run, it's leg flopping uslessly. the boy saw the girl lift a rock, take aim. this one shatterd the head. 

                      ***
Bune ha even wore his dinner dress, Elena noticed. her cubby was cramped with a full dining set in it, but she had insisted on it, wantign ti to be more intimate. Bune was sittign opposite her, packing his face with YeaSteak
and dripping water down his chin as he tried to get the formal part of the meal finished. Elena took her time, savoring every bite of food. She looked up and Bune's plate was cleared, heard him clear his throat. 
    ""well, that was very good. thank you."" his eyes were still hungry. not for food.
""I just wanted to discuss this small matter over a better setting, away from all those people. i had hoped we coudl work something out. ""
    Bune slid out of his chair and slowly walked over so that he was standing above her. His lips split apart in a toothy grin.""oh, i think we can definetly reach an agreement, miss Anlai."" He reached down to touch her hair, "" we most certainly -""
   ""did you enjoy your food?"" elena grabbed his hand before he coudl touch her. ""I hoep you did, mine was very tasty.""
  Bune backed away, his face turning cautious.""yes...yes, it was very nice.""
  ""good."" Elena smiled at him, no longer concealing her amusment. ""of course, my steak came from my crap, so i knew it was goign to be good. Yours, however, came from Hans, so i didn't knwo if it woudl be good or not.""
   Bune looked down at his plate, a hand slowly going to his middle.'you don't mean?""
 ""yep, comander, you just ate crap.and it is darn good for you, too."" Elena got up and walked over to him, her face inches from his. ""and if you don't start makign a few changes around here, everyone is goign to knwo about it.""
she pointed to the tiny video camera tha Bune had not noticed on his way in. Suddenly she giggled, slapped him on the shoulder. ""don't look so sick, Bune, molecules are molecules. now."" she led him ove to a chair so that he could sit. ""the first thing i want you to do is make peopel listen to Hans more in Reclamation.he might save the station if you let him. also-""
  Bune stood, sudenly furious, ""Why shoudl i care what you guys say? doyouthink anyone will belive that video? I coudl have all of you off of this station in an hour, with or without spacesuits! Don't think anyone wil believ etha i ate anything but yeast and water!""
    Elena smiled again ""Commander, you did eat only yeast and water. what you also ate, however, were some timy machines that will live in your bloodstream."" She leaned close to him, smellinghis sudden fear adn sweat.""Now i wont tell you what these little Bots are, or what they do. all i will tell you is that if you don't listen to Us well enough, don't say nice things when i am around, don't breathe correctly around me, or any other of the Five, you will regret it. a tiny ligh twill go off in your heart, and suddenly evry Bot inside you willhave a little party. I'll let your imagination tell you what that must be like.""
     Bune slumped into a chair, loooking at his arms and legs in near hysteric fear. 
Elena looked out a port window of her cubby, down at the Blue marble spinning beneath her. 
 ""the second thing you will do is find thier bodies. the one's that have not burned up in orbit yet. they need decent burial's at space.""
   Bune spoke behind her, his voice several shade's hihger than before. ""what do i tell my people? How do I explain this?""
 ""you are the commander, it's your job to make excuses and have changes of heart. "" Elena still left her gaze on the revolving world below her. ""and next, we will need to start settign up a new government down there. If we control it from this station, it shoudl be much more stable.""she turned towards the man sitting beneath her. ""yes, Commander, i think the next few years will be very interestign for us.""
           ***
the rabbit had been roasted over a pit fire that the boy adn girl had made with a feeble lighter and peices of the house tha were unburned. Although it was old adn tough, the meat was better than anything they had tasted in a long time. they sat together,the cone of water between them, and chewed slowly,savoring every bite. wehn everything but the innards was gone, the boy picked up some of the leftovers and turned to the girl. ""bait. hunt again."" the girl walked toward him and took the offal fromhis hands, puttign it back onthe ground. she picked up his hands and made a ring withtheir arms, pushign it closed and looking hard at the boy. he understood and smiled. ""yes, together. hunt meats together."" andalthough he did not knwo hte word for it, the boy wanted to say that they could survive like this. he let go of one of the girls hands and picked up the rabbit's stomach, held it in fron t of the girl so she could see. ""bait. bait"" 
  she caught his look and smiled, ""bait""
he smiled back and they walked out. they left the stomach ona rock.sqeezed each others hands before walking to opposite sides of the ground.  and waited for the future to come and be caught. 



hmmm. want to modify the endign a bit. maybe take ot the boy/girl story entirely. maybe jsut change the ending. maybe make it so the can both talk. dunno. ok, off to bed."

     Ty Boxer moved up the ladder, picking apples of big bertha as he went, occasionally giving a glance out the somewhat dusty porthole as he tried to select only the ripest friuts from the enourmous Tree sprouting up from the center of the arboretum's main floor. above him the flourecent lights plodded along in a steady hum that always left him feelin glike he was just in a monastary, for some reason. 
  ""We need to move on to the peaches.""
ty glance down at the voice which cut through the quiet humming. An impatient face looked up at him, and he recognized jane the red, five feet and two inches of feminine fury holdign a metal transportign cart. 
 ""Comeon, ty, get down already!""
  ""alright, alright. you could be a little more patient.""
""I am patient. i wait quietly while the bank counts out my cashed paycheck. We nmeed to test out the nitrogen on the soil of the peaches and se if we need to send out a shutle for more peanuts. ""
     Ty grabbed the last ripe apple he saw and jumped to the ground.
 ""the only peanuts we are getting are our wages. how do the flowers look on the other side?""
 they both walked across the metal gratign to view the neat split down the Tree's foliage, half  heavy with fruit, the other half exploding in white flowers that made it look as if there had been a light snow the night before. Half in summer, half in spring. 
 ""flowers look good. i dont think we will need to pollenate them ourselves this year, the nanites seem to be doing a better job than we expected."" 
 Red finished her survey abd turned down the hallway, Ty following. they bothe were swallowed up by the dark mouth of an industrial airlock, and the heavy doors vibrated closed. there was a flashign red light that slowly melted into green. with a sigh of air, Ty removed his helmet and breathed deeply, as did Red. 
 ""man, gardeners don't get paid enough for the crap they put up with.""
Ty grinned at her ""we dont get paid enough, period. i 'm telling you, Red, we ought to steal a coupel of vials of seeds from the Greenhouse and make ourselves a fourtune. you know we could do it.""
  Red hefted an apple that was seedless, pure flesh, a thing made by a plant that whose flowers she could not even smell. Looked back out the portal at Big Bertha, alive and thrivign in the carbon dioxide rich enfviroment hat woudl smother a human being in seconds. 
  ""yeah, you keep on saying that.""


thakfully, the peach Tree's and peanuts did not require a 54%  SeeOh two mixture inthe air, and Ty and Red coudl breathe withoutu their claustrophobicv helmets and respirators. Ty bent down and stabbed betweeen the meatl grates with a metal tube and withdrew a clump of dark, moist earth. the bottle he placed it in wrmed to his touch, and there was a small puff of green gas inside the glass vial. 
 ""green for go, red for slow."" he muttered to himself. he paced around the tree's that were only a small branch of the life support system of the humna transport Call. close to a quarter of a mile long, the Call boasted several dozen tree's in it's bottom layers, quietly takign in pollutants in the air and givign off the millions of cubic feet of oxygen and nitrogen that kept a ship going. Plant's ;ike Big bertha were pure food plants, and what little oxygenthey gave off wsa quickly filtereed out from the air to make sure they maintaied the balance that kept her producing 120 apples a month on average every monthe of the  year. 
  But thnakfully, the green vapor indicated that the soil was still good and nutrient laden, ready to be replante this year with something other than peanuts or wild oats. he woudl take a deatiled survey later to see he ideal types of plants tha this soil could support, and then ask the captain for a reccomendation and go with whatever he said, be it tomatoes or corn plants. and always there was 
the dull humming of the lights that never changed in rhythm, always methodically grindign into your mind. 
 ""do you think they aever get tired?"" Ty asked the redheaded female inspectign the bark of one of the peach Trees. jane the Red looked up in curiosity. ""what?""
 ""tired.' Ty pionetd up at the wearily humming lights. ""there's never a day or night cycle here. the lights stay on all the time, so the plants can produce constantly. Heck, we even bred the ones like Bertha to not need night cycles. i just wondered if they ever got tired of always cranking out fruit and flowers on thier branches.""
 ""who cares? they are just plants. you and i both knwo they can't feel anything. the only thing that eh tree's know how to do is grow, and with constant sunlight, thats what they do."" she gave him a look and walked on into the next airlock thta sealed off another Big bertha variety, this one producing the protier rich avocadoes that were devoid of their huge pits, leathery skins, or anything elsethat made them look like they were from earth. 
 
    ""i got a call from another ship."" Ty spoke around a forkfull of protein and yeast supplements. ""seem's that a lot of their Trees are losign leaves.  and don't ask me about the soil supplements and co2 levels, i already checked withthem and everythign 's normal."" he headed off another look from jane with a grin. ""hey, maybe being a gradener will become a more respected position.""
   Jane took a sip of the recycled water and thought for a moment, her eybrows frowning together. ""if they know that it's not the soil or atmo, then why didn't they ask you for advice? you did start the whole idea of-""
    ""they did ask for advice.' Ty cut her short before she could go on. 'they want us both on the next shuttle headed off this boat. Seem's like they can't just firgure it out themelves, so they need a couple of scapegoats. ""
   red flashed her teeth in a smile. ""either way, the scenery change will be good for us.""
ty caught her look and smiled back. this time with a real smile. 


' we jsut havn't ever seen anythgin liek it."" 
 The  commander of the battleship led them to the recently polished airlock so that they coudl stare at the huge Tree, split between sumer and spring. they also say that part of it's leaves were brown. several whole branches were affected. 
  ""how much has oxygen output been affected?"" Ty asked the tall man in the gray uniform. 
""only a few liters a day. we have imported other plants to compensate. but if this is a 
virus or something, we ned to contain it. this is a battleship, mr. Boxer,not a cruise lin ethat can just order new Trees. 
  ""i understand, sir."" ty was uncomfortable around all this grey, he longed to be inside the room with the sick Tree, gettign close to it so that he could feel the heartbeat of its spirit and ask it what was wrong.
  ""so, what do you think?""
The ship's engines humed, drilling their way into his ears.Ty started to prepare a diplomatic answer and was interrrupted by jane's voice.
 ""we've been on this tub for liek five minuites, let Mr. Boxer take things in for a bit, will ya?""
the man turned to glare at jane the Red in her fiv feet and two inches of now quieter feminie fury and ty noticesd that his eyes, also were gray to match his uniform. They must be mass producing them, he though tto himself, and hid a grin as he turned and looked at the dying Tree. the commanders steel voice punched through his brief revery.
  ""and why exactly are you her with mr. Boxer, Miss..?""
ty spun around double time. ""i would liek to get suited up and go in there with my partner, please.We both need to see the Tree up close to really understand what is wrong with it.""
  Jane turned to him in a flash of red as they left, pinning him down wiht anpother one of her looks.
 'do you evenhave any idea?""
""well...kind of.""


They both stood looking up at the huge green pillar rising up from the steel bottom, as alwas split down the middle between summer and spring. Ty's air came in canned batches that always smelled to him like copper, even though he did not knwo what copper smelled like. He saw a neglected fruit hanging fromone of the summer branches and picked it, trying to smell thought the fiolters the sweetness of summer's life that he held inhis hand. 
 ""apricot.i guess being a battle cruiser they need the extra oxygen adn beta carotene.""
  ""they need a lot of other stuff in thier diet to, if you ask me."" Jane's voice came though ttinny, but it did nto mask the sarcasm she had.""perhpas jsut a bit more of those asinine bars and a few more helpings of pissass protein.""
 ""good alliteration."" Ty closed his eyes hard, wishing that he could rub his temples. his head felt liek it had been stuffed full of cotton. and there were the battleship's engines, always pushing into his ears. when he opened his eyes he saw a brown leaf, curled and broken up by some disease that he could not figure out, lyign in front of him. he felt the worlds problems weighing downonhgim, pushignthe air fromhis lungsd whiel he strugled to breathe more.with a sudden fury, he broght his iornclad boot downhard on the helpess dead thing, crushign it to bits of powder and twigs. 
 ""can i ask you something?""
ty looked up at jane, startled from his fugue. ""what?""
  ""why are  still here,being a gardener? there are bunches of spots you could be, heck, when i save up enough i am going to go back to college and go soem of those palces. but you stay here.No one gives you the respect you should have. Even though you started everyth-""
 ""please, Jane, i cant answer that for you. i'm sorry.""
 Ty stared at the smear of brown dust that coated his boot. He yawned inside his suit, wishing for a moment that he could rest.
 ""me too."" Ty caught her yawning in agreement. ""i think that there shoudl be a law of soem sort requiring allable bodied men and woemen to sleep a minimum of eight hours a day. everyones jsut so darn tired all the time.""
 Ty looked at her, then at the dying Tree. ""my god, Jane, you're a genius!""
 ""what?  what did i say?""
Ty said nothing, insteasd he called the atmo control room onhis wristband. ""bring the temperatur edown inhere to near freezing SLOWLY. and shut off the lights for severalhours, pleasae. yes, jsut do it. thank you.""
 Jane started to draw herself up to her five feet two inches adn unbleash some feminine fury when Ty stopped her. ""no time for explinations, just get teh commander adn the atmo people down here at once.""


  ""Well, mr. Boxer, i hope you have good news."" 
Ty was uncomfortable that they mada ehimand jane the Red move up into the commander's briefing area, especially since the primary color used was grey. he got right to the point, eage to get back to the dim lights and green leaves.
 ""gentlemen, your tree's are Dying. not because of any natural cause, but because they are homesick.""
 Another man in grey started to chuckle. ""Should we start reading bedtime stories tothem, Mr.Boxer?  jsut because you gave the world trees doesn't mean youknwo themany more than we do?""
  Ty turned to him, his face calm and his eyes on fire.""do you feel the air, sir? do you sense the oxygen levels dropping? can you smell the sewage backing up yet? ""
 ""hey,dont get pushy, gardener.Just because some dumb palnts are dyign Doesn't mean that youhave to-""
 Ty cut him off as he rose up out of the chair. ""perhaps when you are roasting in yoru own sweat and breathign air that you can't see throgh, then we will talk. i didn't come here to be insulted.""
 the commander spoke, ""Please mr. boxer, we did not mean to insult you. we woudl liek to have yoru insight on this problem.""
 Ty turned to him. ""put the trees on temperature cycles, starting off from normal temperatures to low light, near-freezign conditions. the Tree's will rp thier leaves and stop producign as much oxygen andfruit,but they won't die.""
  ""that is ridiculus"" the other man in gray stood up ""you cant be serious. we woudl lose half our oxygen supply and be forced to live off of protein bars and mineral shots for months out ofh the Standard Year. What you are saying is-""
 ""winter"" ty looked the man in his also grey eyes and fought to keep himself from lashign out verbally at he man. "" the Tree's need rest."" he stated to walk out the door.
 ""BUt what will we do about the oxygen needs?"" 
  ty stopped before leavignthe door and the ship behind. ""well..."" he paused""i guess you could always plant evergreens""
  


Big bertha was as plentiful as ever.ty wondered when she woudl stat to require the inter cycles and tried to picture in his mind the giant Tree no longer split between summer and spring, but united in the cool rest of winter. it was a good thought. Peaceful.
 ""i know why you stay.""
 He looked over at Jane the Red's face hidden behind the glare of a faceplate.
""you stay because you want to help them."" she reached out and softly patted the bark of the majestic Tree, a green and oak giant, silently broodign over the humans that looked up at it from below. jane turned to face him.
 ""I guess they aren't as alien as i thought they were. they always were longing for their seasons."" she laughed adn walked over to stand by Ty.""i guess even Trees get homesick.""
 Ty glanced down at her, a smile on his face and heart.
""yep""




ok, took me a whiel to get the whoel concept of trees in space down.i'm probsably going to improve on this oen a bi tbefore i really say its done. but for righ tnow, theres a bare bones copy."

"event","there is a point in every song, between notes, where there is silence. in my song tonight there were notes of thunder and power that i loved to sing, but nothign compared to the silence. 

the silence was just after a powerhouse chord that the piano played and i lifted my voice upon. I lifted it higher, higher, until i felt as if my feet were no longer touchingthe cold tiled floor.  suddenly everythign stopped and i hung there, poised, ready, sure. i knew the next note, knew it was going to bring down the house, and still i enjoyed the silence better. that hushed, trembling anticipation of the audience, each person waiting with stolen breath for the conclusion, that one power chord. the sudden silence that rivaled the music before it in beauty. i took that silence and i held it beofre me, drinking it all in to the dregs. stil i waited, i waited until the audience was burstign at the seams with the need for that chord. finally, i breathed in, down to the very bottom of my toes, held it, held it, stretchign the tensio0n to the breakign point, and finally lettign it all tumble free in a note that flowed so powerfully from my heart that it filled the room to overflowing and poured over and over the audience. and then, silence. the beating of a heart. the fulfilled sigh of a job well done. 

and in my minds eye, she stood there, listening, and i only sang for her. 

i love singing so much"

hmm, well, i have another job, at best buy in the wireless department, and it's the shit. i love this job. the people are all really cool and nice. plus, the guy i like works there. *sigh* mike olson. he's really nice, tall, older, drives, got a car, and has a job. plus, he doesn't smoke, and i don't think he does drugs or smokes. *yay* for clean cute guys.

he called my work sunday night wondering how i was, but i had just left, so i didn't get to talk to him. poop. hopefully he'll be at work tomorrow, cause i really wanna see him. i've got a big crush on him, and i've like him for over a month or so now. *sigh*

and my prom table is down to me (+date), becky (+date), and sheila and her date josh. and we need at least 5 couples for a table. i don't even know if i want to go anymore. the only reason i'd go now is to show off my dress, otherwise it's going to suck butt. 


well, off to try to do some english, since my project and presentation are due on wednesday. all i have to do is finish writing my stuff up, and practice being john dickens. funfun"

so i went up to my interview at Best Buy after school today (about 11:30), and the guy(s) interviewing me were very nice. the main interviewer went through this magazine book thing and asked me a bunch of questions, and wrote them down. then i had to ""role play"" pretending that i was a salesperson selling stereo's and the other interviewer was the customer. 

i guess i did pretty good, cause they're gonna call today or tomorrow and set up the third (and last) interview with the general manager of the store. but apparently frank (mngr) is pretty rough on interviewees. great. and i was nervous enough today. 


hopefully ill get the job though, cause it'd be good $, and experience in something other than a video store. but i told them i have to have at least 20 hrs a week, or i can't go there. so again, they'll talk to the mngr. 


if not, charles (area mngr at hollywood) is MAJOR buttkissing me into staying. there was even talk about a raise. lol.

then, we all went to subway, then up to adam's work to see if he was still there. but then adam called and we went up to g.b. to pick him up at his dad's house. so we went up to muvico, and watched blade 2, it was okay, it had just a little too much blood for my tastes though, yeah, the whole swimming in pools of blood was *shudder* ugh. anywho, me and adam were joking around the whole time, and just play punching and tickling each other. it was fun.

same thing on the way back, we were all mad tickling each other. kinda cool. but then we get to adam's house, and yeah, blake definately goes ""hey, adam, you like laura right?"", and adam goes ""yeah"". double ugh. then blake says, ""so you wanna go back out with her, right?"", and again, adam says ""yeah"". triple ugh. so im like blushing bigtime, and then blake turns to me, and starts asking me if i want to date adam again, and then adam ""formally"" asks me back out, and im just going ""i don't know"". 

ugh

well, to make a long story short(er) lol, i ended up deliberating it for a bit, then, what the hell i thought, i mean, you only live once, so i leaned over and kissed him. 

*sigh* why do i have to fall for the guy? ugh. well, at least he wasn't actually serious about the whole blood drinking thing. him and blake just like to freak people out. 






i hope i haven't made a mistake. cause i swear, if i get my heart broken again by this boy, im definately becoming an nun. no doubt about it. a nun. lol."

"event","my eyes are feeling somewhat better, but now the skin around the eyes are inflamed and sore. so i came home early from work, sophie said to leave cause my eyes were scaring people. lol (they're all blood red and puffy) ouch. at least the steroid crap the doctor gave me is helping some, i think. 


*yay* im probably going to go see Blade 2 with blake, adam, heather, chris, and annie tomorrow. hopefully my eyes'll be better so i don't look like the walking dead again. lol"

"event","i've been to so many doctors offices in the past week. ugh. and my eyes have just gotten worse, not better. last night i went to nitetime pediatrics again, and they gave me 2 new medicines, and told me to see an opthomologist. 

so i went to the opthomologist this morning, and she took me off one medicine, changed my dosage for the other new medicine, and gave me yet another medicine. the stuff she gave me was some kinda eye steroids, since even that doctor wasn't sure what's going on with my eyes

can i ever have anything NORMAL wrong with me? lol. i guess not. i just get funky eye infections, and have to have surgery on my mouth. lol."

LOL, sorry i loovvee this song. they play in Shrek. cool movie


so, i visited adam at his work yesterday, cause when we were on the phone, he wanted me too, and it was fun. the bum has his own office, and keys and crap. so we hung out there till he got off, and he came to the tattoo parlor with me. 

guys are confusing, cause blake told me again today that he had talked to adam last night, and apparently he definately wants to get back together with me.

GUESS WHAT??!!! im gonna get a tattoo. ill have to wait for my 18th b-day, but i already know pretty much what im going to get i think. i want a celtic cross (black and white) on my upper left arm. that's going to be cool as s***. *yay* can't wait. i even went up to the place im gonna get it done at, it's call Shepke's (or something) across from Lighting Jack's Bar in pasadena. i went up there yesterday with adam. blake told me to go to that one, cause that's where he's getting his tribal tree, and sleeve tattoo done.

if i can figure out how, ill stick a picture of it in here."

"event","ugh, pre-teen boys are some of the most annoying species in the entire world. for example, at like 10 o'clock at work, i was helping a customer, and all of a sudden some kid opens the movie drop and sets a firecracker(s) off. yeah, almost scared the piss outta me. lol. so i had to wait for the police to come, and we even rounded up a bunch of the kids behind the stores, but they said they didn't do it, so no one got in trouble. 

it was kinda funny though, cause we had like 4 cops show up at once. they only show up like that if they're really bored and they hear it over the radio they got. lol. cops are funny. and fat. LOL"

"event","i did really sucky in bowling today, oh well. maybe because i was just reeeaally tired. im going to bed when i get home from work tonight, hopefully. definately needing the sleep.

well, went to see Resident Evil last night, it was a good movie. there were just a couple super bloody parts, and people spouting blood because a zombie just bit them. lol. my friend nashana and her b/f were there, so me and adam sat with them. other than the whole weird thing with him thinking he's immortal, he's still the same pretty much. just now he wears all black, but daaammmmnnn does he look good in it. and his hair was all different, but it still looked good. lol. why do i have to have such a hot ex? ugh. 

even though we hung out last night, im guessing i won't hear from him for another 7 months. lol. and just when i was remembering what fun it is to hang out with him. he is definately one the the greatest guy's to just hang out with. very fun. lol."

"event","yeah, definately had the WERIDEST conversation i've ever had in my life. my ex, adam, thinks he's this immmortal guy, and remembers all his past lifetimes. he says he dies like other normal people, but because he was put in a trance by 5 other immortals he know remembers all his lives. yeah, the scary part it, he was completely serious, and not joking. oh, and to top it all off, he got his ""fangs"" sharpened, and now drinks other immortals blood to remember their lives. well, he may not do drugs anymore, but damn, he does some even werider stuff now. i can hardly believe that i used to date this guy, he never acted weird like this before. now i really don't understand guys, not a bit. :O??????

i don't know what to think about him anymore, i mean, i can be friends with him, but he's definately not the same dude i fell in love with last summer."

well, it turns out i have pink eye, i even went to nighttime pediatrics cause my eyes were itching so bad last night. but my medicine kicked in today, so im no longer contagious, and my eyes aren't the blood red they were last night. *yowch*

ugh, why can't life ever be simple?

we were having a morbid discussion in my psychology class today. it was how that rape victims tend to not be able to pick out their attacker out of a lineup, and even accuse the wrong person quite often. now that's a scary thought. *shudder*"

"event","<strong><font color=""#ffcc00"">BOO!<br /><br />I bet I scared you.<br /><br />So let's see here, three weeks&nbsp;(or is it four?) into spring semester and I'm pretty much failing economics.&nbsp; It's okay, I still have time to try to bring it up, but it's a little depressing, I won't lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I eat noodles twice a day.&nbsp; Almost every day.&nbsp; I really like noodles.&nbsp; And I watch Gilmore Girls re-runs in the afternoon as I make them.&nbsp; Actually, I ususally eat my noodles at 11:30 in the A.M., so I guess that I eat noodles&nbsp;during breakfast time.&nbsp; But technically McDonald's switches over to lunch at 11:00 so I think I'm good.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The other day I was ready to flip a table because I have an A- in rhythm and dance.&nbsp; An A- in RHYTHM AND DANCE.&nbsp; I absolutely refuse to get an A- in rhythm and dance, that would be all kinds of embarassing.&nbsp; I have rhythm!&nbsp;&nbsp;I can dance!&nbsp; And really, am I going to teach rhythm and dance to 6th graders?&nbsp; No, not unless I want to&nbsp;be the crazy teacher.&nbsp; Which could be cool.&nbsp;<br /><br />But I know that you want to know more about my class so let me tell you about how ridiculous it is.&nbsp; Our rhythm and dance professor teaches the class as if it's a gym class and gives us grades on our lessons with no explanation.&nbsp; For example, the other day I taught a lesson and she gave it a B and put ""ask more facilitating questions.""&nbsp; Um, okay, so that deserved an entire letter grade down because I didn't ask enough questions about how we were supposed to jump?&nbsp; And she set the class curve so that a 96 and above&nbsp;is an A.&nbsp; Never before have I been so frustrated with a tiny gray-haired lady who wears pants that are too short.&nbsp; I feel like that was an awkward sentence, but that's okay, I'm going to leave it that way.<br /><br />So I miss EVERYONE.&nbsp; Mira's in Spain, Nidhi's in California, Jacqui's in the Netherlands/galavanting about Europe, Aimee's in Chicago, Lauren's at home.&nbsp; COME BACK!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At least&nbsp;I still have Rod Stewart.&nbsp; </font></strong>"

so its finally friday. i went to hebrew home today to get the letter about how many hours ive been volunteering from ruthann. dammit i hate that lady. shes such a bitch. i was like ""you dont have to do it now...or netime soon...you can take your time."" and shes like ""of course im not gonna do it now. i dont have time!"" uhh she makes me so mad! and there was this guy in her office and like i come in and shes talking to me and he looks back and smiles at me and then he keeps looking about at me while shes on the phone. it was sooo weird, but he seemed nice. i told ruthann about my grandma and he heard and he was like ""sorry for your loss"" it was so embarassing though cuz i almost started crying in front of her. then i went to visit my grandmas friend, lena, and we talked about my grandma and all this other stuff. shes a really nice lady. now theres someone else living in my grandmas room and its just so weird to see someone in it. and i was walking down the hall and like totally expecting my grandma to be sitting there against the wall...it was really hard going back there. i feel like guilty going back there cuz shes not there nemore and i kinda feel like i cant have fun there nemore. i dont know, i just wish thing could be like they were before. i would do nething for that. so many things are taken for granted and then when they are gone, you realize how valuable they really were..."

"event","i remember when my mom my dad and me would go to visit my grandparents every friday. we would ring the doorbell and my grandpa would come running down to welcome us in. we would head up the elevator. i remember walking past this area where you could look down to the main lobby. then we would walk through the dim hallways and open the door to their appartment where my grandma would be sitting in her armchair ready to greet us. we would all sit down and my grandpa would make himself comfortable in his armchair positioned next to my grandmas. we would turn on the tv and watch this stupid game show program that we all loved while i ate my favorite cookies that they always had in their cupboard. we would stay there until night. those were some of the best memories. then, when they moved to hebrew home we would visit them in a new place. it was not as private but i remember sitting down every time with my dad next to me sitting on the bed. my grandpa in his armchair on the other side of me and my grandma next to him and my mom on her special chair that she bought for herself. we would all play this card game and it was always me, my dad, and my grandpa that would always be the last ones left in the game. usually my grandpa would win but sometimes he would let me. those were some of the happiest moments. its those simple things in life that are remembered forever. then when my grandpa passed away i was devastated but i knew that there would be a part of him that would be with my grandma. i remember my dad telling me of his last words: ""how is your mother. make sure shell be okay."" he loved her so much.
i would visit my grandma every friday. i would love to walk down that hallway and turn the corner to see my grandma sitting there in her wheelchair. she looked so vulnerable but i knew that i would be there to protect her now. i would slowly approach her and as soon as she saw me she would spring up from her sleepy mode and grab my hands and kiss them, telling me how she missed me, and she would always tell me how my hair was so long. she would ask about my dad and she would ask whether my mom was at work and how everyone was. she was always so happy to see me. i dont know what im gonna do now. im dreading tomorrow. because once the burial happens its gonna hit me: shes actually gone. and when i walk through that hallway, expecting her to be there, sitting there peacefully, shes not gonna be there. i cant do this. i remember how she was telling me one day that she was in so much pain and that she hoped that she would die soon. i started crying so much and telling her to never say that again. i didnt think it would come this soon. i mean she was fine. i remember visting her last weekend and my dad asked her if she wanted anything to eat. she refused. i asked her if she wanted a hershey kiss. of course she said yes. she loved those. i remember that little black bag that my dad would carry every time we would come to visit her: full with food and candy refills for her nightstand. he threw that bag away and now the candy is just sitting there. and i hate seeing my dad like this. it makes me so sad. hell be sitting there and all of a sudden hell be quiet and ill know what hes thinking about. im having such a hard time going through this. i didnt think it was gonna come so soon. death is such a horrible thing...why does it happen to people we love?"

on sunday i woke up really early and drove to my grandparents to drop off and pick up some stuff for my mom and then i met lexi at starbucks. we had some coffee. mmm i had a chocolate brownie frappaccino soooooooo good! yummay! and then we drove to walgreens, hall, back to walgreens, the kitchen store, and to the center. it was so funny cuz we were like standing there in the parking lot in front of our cars thinking about where else we could possibly go. it was so fun. i love being able to drive. it gives you a totally differnt perspective of the town and its not that boring nemore.
and today was sooooo niiice! so warm and sunny :) so me and amanda drove the center. i was following her cuz we had to look for a parking spot and this stupid guy cut me off and i almost lost her. then a cop was following me. i swear, theyre like always behind me. it scares me so much cuz i get so nervous. i like turned down my music, rolled up my windows, and was going really slow. then we parked at the library and went to get some ice cream at kolidascoops. i got some black raspberry. it was really good. so we were sitting on the bench and observing everyone haha. this one really sketchy guy walked past us like 5 times and right after him came another guy who was probably his friend but they didnt want to be seen together. it was the weirdest thing haha. it was such a fun day today. i cant wait till summer!!!"

i just came home after being stuck in school for like an hour and a half after my midterm ended (which by the way i failed) cuz i didnt have a ride home. so me and amanda roamed around school trying to find a ride and then her teacher offered us one and we ended up waiting for like an hour for her to get ready, it was so annoying. then i finally reached my grandpa and he have me and amanda and then lea came and he gave her a ride home too. okay so lea and amanda were telling me the weirdest story. and i cant get over it haha. okay so this kid in school is so weird, he always wears this firemans jacket and carries around a walkie talkie. and he talks into his walkie talkie and is like ""copy that"" and says all these codes. i just thought that was really strange......."

we said our goodbyes
but i cant go a day without your face

wishing all my feelings was gone

"event","well yesterday i went to the hippodrome. so much fun! i went with lea and hillary and met margarita there. so many random guys were coming up to us and it was so funny because margarita told this guy that he couldnt dance and to stop humping her ass. it was great. it was so much fun at the end cuz i danced with this really cute guy for like an hour and he was so sweet hehe.
but i dunno if im ever gonna be able to go back there again cuz lea and hillary have like made some crazy ass decision that theyre never going back there again cuz they had a bad night. first hillarys cell got stollen and then this ghetto bitch wanted to fight lea for some reason. and leas bro and ilya were like defending her and somehow the ghetto girls friends found their car and smashed all the windows. so now theyre not ever going back there again. well thats just great news for me...ugh now i dont know who to go there with. i mean i dont really wanna be going with katya and her boyfriend. dont get me wrong, i love katya, but having to sit there and look at all there mushy crap. ick...no thanx...ill figure something out...
so today i had a doctors appt. i really hate going to the doctors, it sux so much. so i went there and waited for like an hour in the waiting room and then wait for like another hour in the other room, i was so bored. and then i got my blood test and a hepatitis shot. it hurt sooo much. and both shots were on the same arm so now i cant feel my whole arm and i have a headache. this sux!"

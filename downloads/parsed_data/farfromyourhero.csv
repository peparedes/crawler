you're already thinking 'bout someone else
when he comes home you'll be in his arms
and i'll be gone

i know someday, i'll be the only one

you wait for his spark
you know it'll turn you on
he's gonna make you feel
the way you wanna feel
when he starts to lie,
makes you cry,
you know i'll be there
my day will come
i know someday i'll be the only one

call me selfish
call me what you like
i think its right
to want someone for all your own
and not share her love
and i'll have my way
and you won't have a say
anyway
you don't stand a chance!

you wait for his kiss
you know it'll turn you on
he's gonna make you feel

makes you cry,

i know someday i'll be the only one

you want perfection
see your self-destruction
you don't know what you want
it's gonna take you years to find out!
not giving up
and when you've had enough
you'll take your bruised little head and
you'll come running right back to me!

i will be the only one,
i will be the only fucking one..."

And I knew all your fears
Such joy to hold you in my arms

There's only pain
And nothing I can do
And I don't want to live this life
If I can't live for you

Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (so broken up)
And I give up (I give up) 
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up (breaking up)
I feel like giving up (like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Here I go so dishonestly
Leave a note for you my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
My only one
You are my only, my only one"

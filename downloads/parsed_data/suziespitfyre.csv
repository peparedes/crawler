"event","The more I read, the more I want to write.  Take now for example...I want to write about my life because I'm reading a book where the character (one anyway) is writing a work of fiction based on her own experiences.  The other two characters are involved in the literary world as well, one being an already published author and the other is a literary agent.  This doesn't really matter as it's Gemma who's inspired me a little...or is it Marion Keyes?  Hmmm...

Anyway, I was walking up the stairs to work (it is intirely possible that the impending doom of having to slug it out for 5 hours shelving manky library books has inspired this creative outburst) and wondering if I'd ever been ""ridey.""

Apparently...if you look at my last journal entry, which I was going to erase.  Haha..

Yes, so have I ever been ""ridey"" ? ? ?

Not today, obviously, I'm wearing a pair of flaming bowling shoes, rolled up jeans that I just a bit too tight, a pirate shirt with my signature cut down the front..and pigtails.  More cute, less ridey (I've decided to use the word now with out the "" "" - you do understand what it means, don't you?).

Let's go through my history.

1993 - Ridey, but taken.

1994 - More ridey, but still taken.

1995 - Even more ridey, and enjoying it.

1996 - Ridey, but only for foreigners.

1997 - Agressively ridey, especially in Ireland.

1998 - Ridey, but wanting to find someone to share it with.

1999 - 2003 - Internet ridey.  Then real life ridey for one man.

2003 - Present - Not entirely, but nearly.

Hahahahahahaha...

Ah, shit.  I've got to get to work.  Time to put my nose to the grindstone.

"event","Fat and docile, big and dumb
They look so stupid, they aren't much fun

Cows aren't fun

They eat to grow, grow to die
Die to be ate at the hamburger fry

Cows well done

Nobody thunk it, nobody knew
No one imagined the great cow guru

Cows are one

He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal
He loved Che Guevera, a revolutionary veal

Cow Tse Tung

He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd

Cow doldrums

He mooed we must fight, escape or we'll die
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high

Bad cow pun

But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate

Cows are bummed

He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi

Cows with guns

They came with a needle to stick in his thigh
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye

Cow well hung

Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor

Run cows run!

He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay
We are free roving bovines, we run free today

We will fight for bovine freedom
And hold our large heads high
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

They crashed the gate in a great stampede
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed

Cows have fun

Sixty police cars were piled in a heap
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep

Much cow dung

Black smoke rising, darkening the day
Twelve burning McDonalds, have it your way

We will fight for bovine freedom
And hold our large heads high
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

The President said ""enough is enough
These uppity cattle, its time to get tough""

Cow dung flung

The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef

Cows on buns

The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed
They mooed their last moos, they chewed their last hay

Cows outgunned

The order was given to turn cows to whoppers
Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers

We will fight for bovine freedom
And hold our large heads high
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

Um...I'm busy...very busy at the moment.  I'm moving in with my crazy ass boyfriend and going bonkers in the process. You have no idea how much stuff you have until you move...lemme just say that.

It's weird, I'm upset to move from my lovely apartment in my lovely neighbourhood but I'm excited to move in with my lovely boyfriend into his lovely apartment..so it's strange.

I cry too much lately..at the drop of the hat.  I bailed on Sunday when we were moving things...and I mean SPLAT! out on the porch because it was wet and I went FLYING...and I bawled the whole way back to Westmount.  Oh, it's tough sometimes.

Anyway, I have no time to do this, I have so many other things that I have to do before 6PM tonight..sooo...

I've got to write, go shopping, go to the post office, and get a few things sorted here.  The cleaning never seems to get done, but then again, it's prolly because I'm moving at the end of the month.  I also want to exercise, but I have no idea where to start..I suppose I could go walking today with Pogue Mahone, he's postering the Plateau today fairly early, but then that might compromise the other stuff I wanted to do today.  And Tiki Surfah has demanded (hardly) that I write a page a day, even if it kills me...so I have to do that as well. 

Ah, the joys of being unemployed.

"event","Yes, I love roomies, and this one happens to be my best friend...although she said I wasn't her friend...that we never talked.  But I seem to recall just Wednesday last hanging out with her and then going out to L'80s night.  It was a great night...then I did laundry, I think, the next day...and as I was dying a load of black laundry, I let her put in some of her black clothes..and that makes me evil, and not a good friend, right?

Haha..

Something's afoot in Quebec City.  Or at least that's where I think the bad vibes were caught.  I wasn't there...I woulnd't know...but apparently when my mom was driving my best friend to St. Denis I got very evil and hurtful.  Now, I know that I have a sense of humour...and I know that sometimes I say things quickly...but I never, ever intentionaly try to hurt people's feelings.  I'm not like that, I don't do things like that.  But apparently on this evil car ride from Hell..or too Hell...I'm not sure...I did that.  This is what I was quoted on the phone last night...

Picture it, a lovely car ride filled with hilarity.  My mother was driving a rental car, my boyfriend (who apparently defines my personality according to my roommate) and I were sitting in the back seat...the roomie in the front.  We all piled into the car and chatted...nothing seemed wrong, except that my mother didn't turn where we told her too and we were laughing about it for a while.  The rest of the car ride was joking and whatnot...all except Elizabeth thought things were normal, dare I say it...FUN??? ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!  NO, not that!

*Look of shock and horror*

But I said something I shouldn't have...apparently...told my friend that she was like a mother.  Something that she's been telling me...""I know what it's like to have a teen-age daughter now after having lived with you.""  Well, thanks for the compliment...I had no idea I looked that young!  Haha..oh, and she's obsessed with cleaning the kitty litter.  I mean, that's why she says that, because she has to do my dishes and clean up after me.  Which I admit is somewhat true...but it's hard to do things around here when they're already done.  Anyway, she liked my mom's shoes, and I made a comment..totally innocent..and now I'm evil..and she's moving out.  Sooooooooooooo weird.  I think there might be something else going on.

There is..I'm sure of it."

"event","Daytona Beach was awesome! It was so great to have an actual spring break this year. I hadn't been on a vacation with anyone except my dad since senior beach week & it was a welcome change. The weather was good most days but it's not even summer yet so I didn't think it'd be outrageously hot. I got darker, but as Dallas says, I can never actually be ""tan"" HaHa Yet now I am faced with going back to Jesuit and I am dreading it so much more than I ever thought I would. Maybe it's just all the work I have to do in the next month. I just am surprised I am dreading going back to a place I used to really love. I definitely want to see my friends and all that, but something just isn't the same anymore. I'm excited after this year I will only have one more year left, but it scares me too. Next year will be so different from my previous years....so many people I love will be gone. But many I love will still be here. There's just so much to think about in the next few months and year. 

Well I suppose I need to pack; unpacking to pack again. Lovely.

Back to Jesuit in about 5 hours.....ugh"

"event","I am not very consistant with updating my journal, nor do I use it like I would a normal journal as some people do. But tonight I feel the need to get my feelings out, regardless of whether anyone really reads this thing or could possibly give me a little advice.

<lj-cut text=""My current thoughts"">


I'm not exactly sure what is wrong with me except that I find myself overrun with inner troubles and questions. I am usually very studious and place grades and studies as a top priority but lately it seems that I am putting them aside. This is extremely bad to do right now since now is the time I need to really boost my GPA to impress law schools when I apply in October. I don't know if my education is taking a backseat simply because my mind is flooded with other thoughts or if I am just in some sort of funk. Hopefully spring break will rejuevinate me and I will come back motivated and back up to par. 

I have been off my anti-depressant for 2 years now and am very proud of that fact. I'm also proud that I proved to myself I am able to cope with difficulties without the aid of a pill. However, it sometimes seems that I am too easy going and laid back, thus not worrying about certain issues that Need worried about...like school. My dad says that I am probably just in need of a break but I am afraid it's more than that. So that scares me...

Also I keep thinking about what the future is going to bring. It seems that all I can think about is the future, where I will be for law school, if schools will even accept me, if my LSAT score will be high enough, what next year is going to be like with almost all my friends living off campus, and where Dallas will end up. I keep forcing myself to enjoy the present but the idea of the big changes happening in just a few short months keeps popping up. 

It boggles my mind...I have a boyfriend who loves me deeply, the greatest friends I've ever had in my life, and things are just going so well but inside I don't feel right. I know I have grown a lot the past year and that somewhat contributes to my constant thoughts or worries, but I cannot find the reason or the area which makes me feel so wrong. I feel out of place, discombobulated, all in all out of sorts with myself. So I try to be contemplative & introspective but it only leaves me feeling even more confused. It's fine when I try to push the thoughts to the side, but I know they are there and can see their effects in other areas. The annoying this is I hate that whatever is bothering me is effecting my education. I pride myself on being intelligent and making really good grades (yes I skip occasionally but it seems to have gotten worse recently) and now I am not doing as well as I should. Maybe I am just too critical and too much of a perfectionist and that's why I feel my grades aren't up to par, but they aren't, regardless of why I think so.

I simply hate feeling this way and not knowing the cause. This certinaly isn't all I'm feeling but I doubt I could even begin to explain in words. Maybe this is just me rambling and getting things off my chest or into words, but I think it helped a little."

Then talks about school and how God punishes those who diss Green Tea by hiding its splendor from them. Even more surprising was the hug from Charles before I left. Looks like he may be a better step-father prospect than previously thought. 

Went to WallyWorld with Dad for back to school shopping. Fun to race carts through the parking lot with a grown man~ Very tired but in a good mood. Going back to Jesuit on Saturday, kind of looking forward to but also somewhat dreading. Last semester to spend with some of my favoritest people (favoritest is NOT a word, but these people are so wonderful, they deserve it). 


Anyway....spending qt with Meg t/m after work, vegging out & watching movies. What a great send off."

"event","Rented Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind last night. Absolutely fell in love with it. Some people may disagree, but I think it's magnificent. Jim Carrey is astonishingly good, much more subdued character, but pulls it off.

So glad to be home with my Dad. Getting lots of really good, yummy vegetarian, homecooked dishes. Not so glad that all my friends from home decided to take the one weekend I'm in town, to venture OUT of Princeton. But it worked out, I got a lot of work done & some much needed rest.

School is going well, but I'm glad to be in a different atmosphere for a few days. Shed some tears the night before I came back because my mom resorted back to the inevitable good/bad, good/bad way of our relationship. Then calls this evening to see if I want to have lunch tomorrow. Dallas made quite a brilliant observation as to why she does these things to me, only after meeting her once. Threw me off balance, but made me happy to know it's not just me that thinks this way. 

My Grandma Hazel had a hip replacement Tuesday & has been touch & go since then. She's doing better now but I can't go visit because I have a cold & don't want to make things worse for her.

Back to school though--I can't stand the tedious, unnecessary work of one of my core classes! It's useless information I will forget once I take the test. In my major classes I am doing such intense, philosophical work, am actually learning valuable ideas & the tedious core work takes longer than major papers. Frustrating to say the least. 

The job isn't what I thought it'd be. Nice to make some money, but they haven't paid us yet so I am still waiting to call it nice. I'm wishing I would have stayed a desk worker. Thinking I'll apply again for next semester. At least I have guaranteed hours & get my paychecks on a regular basis. 

I'm getting closer & closer with the girls. So glad to finally have my core group of best friends. Miss, El, Lil Lauren & Sher make life easier. The guys are still just as wonderful as ever...they jump me off guard because they love me! Getting to know Dallas' friends better has been great too--my surrogate boyfriends provide me with much laughter. 

Dallas is fantastic. I'm blessed to have him & couldn't ask for more. He brightens my world more than I thought possible. Never a dull moment with that boy. 

Haven't posted in so long, thought people may want to catch up on my ever so exciting life. Can't complain--life is more than good. Happy to be content."

Living with my Kindred Spirit will be Fantastic!! And VEAL will be back to their old drinking habits! Not to mention, there's this amazing guy I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time with!

"event","This weekend was so much fun. After a hellish week of being sick, terrible migraines, class, and work, I got a pedicure on Thursday & then Dallas came. On Friday we drove down to Kentucky to see his parents. I was quite nervous, but they are so nice & according to Dallas, they absolutely loved me. We watched terribly embarrassing home videos of little Dallas and his brother Daustin. Being an only child, it was the cutest thing to watch their interactions. It was also nice to be around a loving, married couple who has been through a lot but still love one another & let it show. It was a really great trip. 
Then Dallas & I were so wrapped up in talking that we ended up almost running off to Tennessee rather than heading back here to Princeton. After backtracking & then being stuck in construction for an HOUR, not to mention the fact Kentucky trees & grasses despise my body, the trip was long, tiring, full of tissues & sneezing, but it was funny & a great time with a wonderful guy! 
When we finally arrived back here, my dad & Connie had fixed us a fabulous dinner, with tons of wonderful food & even more wonderful dessert. We attempted to watch a movie, but I passed out & woke up to only go to bed.
Sunday, we went to church, then I took him to meet my mom & Charles. Undoubtedly, lit conversation ensued & my mom & Dallas have a few favorite writers in common. Then, follwing in Meg's footsteps, I took Dallas' TropicalSno virginity LoL
TropicalSno is seriously the best SnoCone place ever!! Such yummy flavorful icey goodness!
Of course I was sad when Dallas had to leave, but I will be in Wheeling Friday to help celebrate Sher's birthday (Yay for pre-roomie *kindred spirit* bonding) so I will see him again in only a few days. 
I thought getting to know each other over the summer may pose some difficulties but it has all been truly great & looks to be very promising in the future. 
I'm just happy."

Yesterday proved to be a day full of fun, food, & friends, not to mention Garin's t-shirt depicting ""Fuck you, you fucking fuck"" Now how is that for alliteration?? LoL What a wonderful way to celebrate Meg & Garin's consecutive birthdays!

Ben's apartment always turns out to be a blast! I had such a good time with Meg, Em, Jus, Ben, Choskie, Buford, Tyler, Lindsay, Josh, Garin, Matt, Norm & all the rest! It's great to end up hanging out with the people you used to be friends with growing up, not to mention those you didn't know so well in high school AND being surrounded by some of the absolute best friends in the entire world! Even though it wasn't my birthday, I felt so loved. Yesterday was also great b/c I got to see/talk to my best friend Sheena! Oh how I have missed her. This summer just keeps looking up. I can't wait until 4th of July at the lake...it's going to be fantastic! (All these exclamation points fail to express how happy I am) I thought this summer would just be full of work & internship stuff, but it's turning out to be lots of fun."

I really lucked out on the whole deal: I love it, I get paid, and I get 6 hrs worth of credit for school! This totally reaffirms the fact I want to be a lawyer.

I was somewhat dreading coming back to Princeton due to lack of friends, but I have managed to not be lacking in that department. Meagan of course is my best friend and we can always hang out, but I'm also getting to be close with Ben, Choskie, Garin, & Emily again which is great! We all went dancing this week and although it reminded me why I was glad to get out of this town, I did see a lot of people I haven't seen in a while and had a good time.

The vegetarian thing is much easier to do at home, and I can actually get balanced meals that I like to eat here. But I have been doing well with it & feel better about myself, my body, & my health already. On that note, I also made myself buy a yoga dvd & am going back to the fitness center with Meg, so hopefully the body will be in good shape all around. Plus, we have to look good for 4th of July at Ben's lakehouse! haha

Academically, I was prepared to start my summer class Tuesday, but it was cancelled, so I must try to get into another school's program for the second summer term. I don't want to do it, but with this one I will be able to work more hours at the firm afterwards, so we shall see how hard it is =(

I'm kind of glad to be home now that I've settled in, but I'm looking forward to coming up for Levi's pool party & visiting everyone, probably staying with Beth & Miss for a day or so (I miss the girls) and seeing whoever is around. I just have outgrown this place on so many levels and I'm looking forward to being back in Wheeling. Speaking of outgrowing, I am throwing around ideas for next summer either to stay in Wheeling & work, maybe study abroad in Italy if I can get scholarships & stuff, or maybe head down to the beach and work down there. I'm not sure yet if I will have the monetary means to do so, but this $8/hr at the firm will surely be helpful.

This summer seems to be a continuance of personal growth, rebuilding old friendships, and overall, just a chance to enjoy being the person I have grown into the past year."

the voice of a loved one
the touch of a hand
a good book

receiving a package
an unexpceted visit/phone call
freshly made blueberry muffins
random gifts
salvation army t-shirts

Sure friends should be concerned about others, but going behind someone's back to talk about how they feel I was not dealing/handling certain things in my life correctly or that I cry too much & am too emotional is not friendship:  it's being two-faced. I would like to think my ""friends"" would have the decency and courage to speak to me face-to-face, but since they cannot, I really don't give a damn what they think or say. I do not criticize their life, for they are all adults and have the right and choice to live life the way they choose. Sure I can voice concern, but I do it in a kind manner to their faces; it is up to them to take it or leave it. I am just SICK of ppl thinking they know what my life is like...when in truth half of these ppl don't even know themselves! 

I have been through many hardships in my life, in relationships, with my family, with friends, all of that & each person/experience has taught me to be a better version of myself. I know I have faults but at least I have the courage to recognize them, embrace them, and do my best to change what I can. Other ppl don't even have the balls to see their inadequicies. I used to want everyone to like me but in the past year or so I have gotten to the point where I don't care. People may like who I am, faults & all, and that's great. If they don't, oh well...chances are I don't like them either. Life is too short to worry about the insignifacant ppl who don't matter. I've tried to be nice about these things I'm feeling & just backed off from confiding in certain ppl b/c I refuse to have my life ridden with ppl who act like they care when in truth they have nothing better to do than judge me, point out what I am doing wrong, or should be doing differently. Get a fucking life!! I have many more wonderful ppl and things to fill my life.

As to those wonderful ppl who actually have the courage and compassion to be truthful with me, pointing out how I suck in some areas, forcing me to take a look at my faults, but wishing me to be the best version of myself: I have so much gratitude to you...I love you all & couldn't ask for better ppl to surround myself with. Constructive criticism is what helps friends learn more about themselves while bonding with others who need help as well. It is people like you who make life so great!

I suppose this is enough ranting for now. I have eased myself into straying from these hypocritical ppl & it makes life much more grand. If you think you might be one of these ppl, you probably are, but some will just doubt themselves too much. As for those who are true friends, you have no question as to who you are...I express my love for you all everyday.

People can get mad at me for this, but like I said, I really don't care. This is me, take it or leave it."

"event","Usually Finals Week makes me want to die but this one seems to be going well so far. My aim was being dumb all weekend but right before my first final it signed me, so I took it as a good sign that today would go well. My Shakespeare final wasn't all that bad but I am glad it's over! Then I came down to check my email & had one from my absolute best friend in the world Jon Bailey. He and I have been best friends for 4 yrs now. He was the one person who always stood by me & was there for me during my parents' separation. It's crazy though how times changes b/c last August he got married to the only other girl besides me that he's been in love with.

The summer before I came to WJU was when Jon told me he was in love with me. I was utterly speechless, which never happens to me! LoL I had really liked him my junior year of high school but figured he just saw me as the little sister, best friend type, so I moved on and dated other ppl. So when he began asking me exactly when I had stopped liking him I was a little floored. My family, especially my dad always told me Jon really loved me & that one day he would make his move. I adamantly denied this and told them they were crazy. Jon was not the regular best friend:  he would show up at my door with my favorite blizzard from DQ, make an impromptu dinner & a movie invitation, or just show up b/c he felt I was having a bad day. Now most ppl would see this as he really liked me & was making all these moves, but in all honesty, Jon is just that wonderful of a guy. Senior year he would come around a lot more but I figured that was b/c I was going away to school & he'd miss me HaHa

Well about 2 weeks before I came here, Jon took me to my favorite restaurant and then instead of going home took me to our old elementary/jr. high school parking lot and told me we needed to talk. He told me he knew it was the worst possible timing but he couldn't let me leave without telling me he loved me. I did not know what to say so I told him I needed to think about it. And after a while I realized that Jon was really everything I looked for & actually wanted to be with me so I said yes. It was really hard leaving him but it would get even harder.

Once I came to WJU I realized that I was no longer sure if I was in love with Jon the way he was in love with me. It had turned from a great friendship to an intense love and I wasn't ready to handle that & a new college experience. The hardest thing I ever had to do was tell him when he came up here to visit that I just couldn't do it. I felt awful & wouldn't forgive myself. 

Jump ahead to that spring:  Jon tells me he has begun dating his high school sweetheart again & then one day announces he's going to ask her to marry him. I wanted to die b/c I knew that deep down I felt he was making a mistake. I tried to convince him to wait, to not rush into things, but one day while working at the library, he comes in, drops the ring in my hand & asks me if she'll like it. I bitingly said of course and listened as he told me how he was taking her to MY favorite restaurant, the same one he took me to before he confessed his love, and how he was going to pick her up. I was devastated. I was going to lose my best friend to a girl who despised me & hadn't treated him well 3 years earlier so why would she treat him differently now??

The day I left to come back here for sophomore year was the wedding. I went, I was in tears, & watched as my best friend was stolen away from me. Then I had to hug her and congratulate her, but then I had to hug Jon. He hugged me so tightly I thought I'd break, told me he loved me...I said the same, told him I was happy for him and walked out the door to drive 4 1/2 hrs to Jesuit. Since then we rarely talk as they moved to NC, but it still makes me so happy when I hear from him. He's still my best friend, I will always love him to death, & I just hope that I was wrong in thinking he made a mistake. It has worked out for the best & I am not one to wonder ""what if""...I made my decision almost 2 yrs ago & if I had done it differently, I would have missed out on some other wonderful experiences."

"event","Well this evening was a fun-filled night of writing papers. It involved men, women, murder, ghosts, witches, gender reversals, the want of power, & the horses of the apocalypse all down in Iggy computer lab. It also included an impromtu trip to DQ with my kindred spirit Sherry, who also spent this beautiful evening slaving away in front of a computer. While typing our papers, we immersed ourselves in constant AIM conversations, smoke breaks, death threats to ppl listening to the same awful song over & over & over again, & hysterical laughter ensuing from even the most mundane activities. Luckily my paper is not due until Monday morning, but Sher's is due t/m & she will sadly be typing for the rest of the night. 

I also have come up with a theory: Last week was called Hell Week & this week is called Dead Week. I feel that these two should be switched, for last week everyone had so much work to do they felt as though they were going to die. This week is supposed to be the week without much work, yet everyone is so tired from last week and has even more work to do this week that they feel as though they are burning in Hell. Thus, finals week we are all dead, rotting in Hell together, trying to bribe the Devil with our souls so that we may all get good grades on our finals & the week be over. Now you can dispute this all you like, but I enjoy the mental picture as my body is tired of slaving over numerous papers, spending many late nights in the lab, & being plain tired of it all. I will either stab my eyes out or resort to incurable fits of laughter to deal with the stress. I know I will be fine, but I suppose I somewhat thrive on it, even though I complain. Such is life...

As Sherry so poignantly pointed out, when ppl ask us how we met we will say ""we made the same mistake"" I absolutely love this girl! We are so much alike...as we like to call it, kindred spirits...we like the same kinds of music, that most ppl do not like, we say the same things, we share the same philosophies, we hate ppl who have no better time than to worry about other ppl's lives, we have quite similar sex stories, we eat sprees, & the list goes on & on. Sleep is finally going to take over & I need to retire to my warm bed, resting my hands which are going to start to cramp up on me. 

Until next time my dear..."

"event","With the school year winding down, I've been reminiscing a lot about this past year. It seems like only a little while ago I was packing up to come here as a freshman & now I'm almost ready to leave here, returning as a junior. As I reminisce, I also am looking towards the future, thinking of how in just a year from now some of my absolute best friends at this place are going to be leaving, heading out into the world, going to grad school, & starting new paths for their lives. It makes me so happy for them but also scares me into the reality that only 2 years from now that will be me, heading off to start law school, not knowing where the path will then lead.

I had an amazing year. A year ago, I was dealing with my parents' recent divorce, reeling from a terrible relationship which I never should have put myself through, meeting the absolute best and fun-loving guys I've ever known, and then falling in love with one of the most amazing and fabulous guys I've ever met.
Even though many things have changed since then, it seems as though this year has been full of things that have taught me so much about life, love, friendships, and myself. Not to mention all the crazy & fun times I have experienced and all the fascinating things I have learned through my education.

This year has been a great one & I hope they only continue."

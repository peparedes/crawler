"event","Well I was just came up with this and decided this was probably the best place to put it. 

TEN THINGS I LIKE:
The way that apple juice feels genuinely healing.
the way that bongs taste like rainbows and butterflys.
my bed when its cold and its like a little nest.
nice chunky sandwhiches (not girly ones)
the fact that when you lose mobile phones, you can ring em and they tell you where they are.
that really satisfying noise you get when you hoover something really dirty.
the way my alarm clock wakes me up, it takes 3 hours and involves me listening to as many little snippets of radio as i like.
the way I can stay up till 3 am and no-one cares.
the warmth of my new leather jacket.
lesbians.

TWELVE THINGS I DO:
Drink applejuice and Coca cola like its going out of fashion.
Listen to Alkaline Trio while im falling asleep. (dream music!)
sit in my room on crappy days, smoking a joint, all wrapped up in my duvet
Eat cheese before im going to bed. (I like dreaming...)
sit and lean out my window for hours at night and watch the stars/the moon/the thunderstorm
lay on my bed and play my electric guitar unplugged for hours on end.
Escape to my sisters room to smoke weed and watch films when my mum is on her period.
skate up to the local shop at least once a day, where the crazy shop guy steals my chocolate bars.
think up things that are almost as blatantly homosexual as this.
talk shit.
Laugh like George W Bush at a secret World Destruction meeting
Chase Blue String.

If you read this, you have to take it, put it on your journal and change the answers to suit you. you know how these things go.

real update coming precisely never

Si (AKA Scringe)

(this entry bought to you buy smoking hash in the garden with my sister, not having a job and far too much free time and the mighty apple juice conglomerates of America.
they want your soul.)"

"event","heres a sample of the new short story set im writing. This is just a taster, the finished story will be finished soon. please comment if you read it!

<lj-cut text= The Road >

Two ciggarette butts burn silently in the dust at the side of the road.
The dust is already beginning to settle, as the caddilac speeds through the desert,
red dust projected into the air, a trail visible for miles.
The suns beating down on the car, and the car glistens right back at it, jet black panels gleaming.
Reaching boiling point in the caddilac, the open roof lets the girls breath.
Lilly breaths heavily, because she is sleeping. Her blonde hair streams out behind her.
Shes probably dreaming, but we wont know until she wakes up.
Karen is worried. She's worried because Lily's been asleep for seven hours;
She's worried because Lily hasnt drunk anything for over 8 hours.
But most importantly, shes worried because Lilly fell asleep fried out to the sidelines on acid.
She's also worried because that little white arrow, which has been gnawing away on the edge of her nerves for over three hours,
has just ticked over in to the red.

the hours seem to have been adding up recently, and this infinite stretch of road seems to take the phrase infinite to new bounds.
normally, a road you would call infinite would really only be a few hundred miles long.
But this road....
is INFINITE.
This doesn't mean that theirs no-where to stop. Oh no. technically, an infinite road should in fact roll straight on through
any place which could possibly exist at the side of A road. Keep driving, they say, and you can reach anywhere you want to go.

But, unfortunately for the passengers of the Caddilac, this didn't mean their was a service station anytime soon.
And, Fortunately for the passengers of the aforementioned vehicle, the laws that govern this universe are not always as they seem.
Right on cue, Lilly opens her eyes and stares straight up at the deep blue sky, tinted through her sunglasses.
The colour blue, for her, right now, is a bit trippy. So she sits up slowly, grinning softly and stares at the road ahead of her.
""We gonna stop their?""
Karen snaps out of her philosophising about the road, and acknowledges Lilly's awakening. 
Karen is relieved; for a moment their, just a heartbeat, she was worried. 
Was she going to show it?
Hell no.
""Good fucking morning to you too. Nice to know you could join me.""
Lilly knows she deserves this. Shes also to out of it to care. She smiles, opening and sipping a luke warm bottle of water.
""Don't gulp all that,"" snarled Karen, irritation creeping into her tone, ""It's gotta last us. you fucking waster.""
Lilly knew her to well. She knew she didn't care about the water, Didnt care that Lilly had been sleeping;
Karen was just pissed off because Lilly got to shoot the acid and Karen had to drive, mind numbing driving.
Lilly laughs. 
""Why can't we just get water from their?"" she asks, and points ahead at the empty desert.
""WHERE?"" Karen snaps. She's been keeping her eyes fixed on the road ever since Lill awoke,
avoiding her gaze, acting bitter.
and now she turns to face Lilly, glaring.
""There hasn't been anything on this road for- for forever. No cars, no towns, no landmarks."" 
No fucking gas stations, thats for sure, she worries as the white needle starts to scratch away at her concentration. 
""Look. Nowhere to stop. So shut up. Your tripping, bitch.""
Lilly smiles and nestles her head backagainst the headrest. Some days its not worth trying.
Karen snaps her head back round to face the road, and slams the brakes on as hard as she can. 
""thats fucking wierd,"" She mutters to herself as she lets the caddilac roll gently on to the forecourt of the petrol station.

"event","Self-love and adoration is only an experience open to those not experiencing doubt.
The innards and workings of the human soul are often not a subject taught or sought by many, and often cases the truth is somewhat distorted by the medium of ego, image and conformity.
Conformity is not a issue of a group of people against the mainstream- conformity is an issue of an individual conforming to a group, be it the group of mainstream society or the people that person would like to call their friends, other influentual people in the enviroment around them and the general direction in which a particular group of people is moving. The medium in which this can be transferred is many- the way you dress, how you act, the way you talk, and most importantly the behaviour you experience in a social and external context. 
While many may choose to conform not to the mainstream, those of lower intelligence and those oft of higher intelligence may be dragged down by the activites of a group. for instance, violence in one person spwans violence in another, conscious or unconsciously aware of the vicious circle involved. non-comformity, it would seem, is only a luxury available only to the truly eccentric, the truly willful, the truly true. Non comformity is no longer non comfortity if it is simply conforming to a set of non-mainstream demands made buy a slightly more interesting, maybe more politically/socially aware people. 
Sometimes this is a good thiung0- unfortunately, sometimes it is not.
Some people seem to be under the impression that to be a punk, to be involved in a scene full of punks, going to shows, hanging out, that you must be an arsehole. you must be a violent, stupid idiot who thinks its funny to be violent to his peers and trash the surroundings he is in. For a second i may be tempted to understand a few of these ideologies- trust no-one, live fast, die young. and thats ok, i guess for the people who it works for. But this certainly doesnt make it any more wrongfor someone who is nice to their friends, supports them, sits and listens to their problems, chooses maybe not to be agressive but instead accepting of the people around them. Surely the decision to correct whats wrong in the world around you should not be greeted with crys of ""Fucking Hippy"" and suchlike, but more with praise and mutual approval.

Such is the way of the modern world.
some people refuse to listen to original ideologies- standing for freedom, liberty and a true system of peaceful anarchy. To be honest, ive had enough of listening to what people think when all i have to do is sit around and wait five minutes to wait for them to fucking break their own moral code like the hypocrites they are. if you believe in something, yuo should stand up for it. Which is why i cant call myself an anticapitalist- I may despise and detest the capitalist system, their is nothing personally I can do to change it, especially through agression and violence. I cant say that I believe in animal rights for I still eat meat. (although i do believe in animal rights and see this more as a character flaw than a lack of belief.) However, I decided as i am always thinking these things, its time to put my money where my fucking mouth is and actually go out and make a difference in the way my life is run. For did someone once say, ""an ideology is still alive, although you may be the only one who is still living it like its the real thing. and that doesnt make it dead until you are long buried.""
so -
thought for the day. go out and change the world, dont think, do, and maybe you can make it a better place for the people you care for.

"event","hey!
So last night was my sisters 21st party and she decided to celebrate in ""style"" by inviting all her relatives and friends and colleagues to the tudor and getting everyone drunk.
a townie disco was even hired to make the evening even more annoying for me..
although it would seem that most of Louise's friends are pretty cool. She works at an animla hospital called St Tiggywinkles and most of the people she works with their came along, I didnt know they were all actually relatively cool and some of them were even younger than me, i think the oldest one was like 20 which was pretty cool. I met this guy called No Pants Matt who had stripped to only his boxers by ten past nine and was trying to get with everything in sight, male, female, me, friend or louise relative. but that aside, he was pretty cool and he liked NOFX. I met this other guy called Matt as well who reminded me so much of Andy that it was just scary. unnatural like :p. Also some random 20 year old girl who works with louise tried to get with me and that amused me greatly. Also, I decided to introduce myself to everyone as Wombat and everyone started calling me it. it was funny.
I've decided I dont like Louise's relatives- the uber-chavvy Mark and Tony, smarmy fuckers tried to start a fight with me outside the fucking toilets because of my spiky, spiky hair and then suddenly became all nice and smiley and making racist jokes when they realised i was their cousin. not by blood (or blud) thank fuck.
And i got to meet a lot of Louise's long time friends who she went to school with and who are always at the pub with her although i know half of them already. It's kind of cool to be at the age where you can have a drinking contest with Louise's friends and hang out with them on equal terms rather than when i was younger and they treated me like the little kid i was. I also drunk way too much but wasnt even particularly drunk- 5 pints of Carlsverg, 4 JD and cokes, 3 shots of JD, a Double JD and coke and a double of Vodka. My sister was slaughtered though. she kept hugging me and andrew and going you know, i love you. your the best brothers ever. Then she ran me over to random people and said ""This is my brother, he's a punk!"" that was kinda funny.
I also got to have a really long conversation with my sisters best friend Lindsey about how much pot she smoked, and we were both kind of amused/annoyed that both of us smoked pot and never knew the other one did. she promised me next time she comes round my house shes gonna bring me some! hehe. I also got to talk to the DJ guy from the disco, who is actually pretty cool, he hates the townie music he plays and actually listens to SOAD and other cool stuff i cant remember. he just thinks Discos are a cool hobby- fair enough.
until next time.

I am very sorry to say i think i am developing some sort of syndrome. some kind of fucked up relationship syndrome- it seems the only girls im attracted to at the moment are ones i cant have (and it would seem on my part that would be an excruciatingly large number.) 
I can't br btothered to go into further details here as i havent slept in my oen bed for over 48 hours and have had no sleep at all for as long as i can rememver. i think its time i went to bed.

But it doesnt really bother me that much either way.
I mean, i did have fun, i got some cool presents, and i guess i can grudgingly admit it was kind of nice hanging out with my family. Hell, its only one day a year.
I now have an MP3 player, and a new bowling ball, and some CDs which are pretty cool, oh and i FINALLY got GTA San Andreas (my own copy, woo!)
hmmm....
not really actually that much to say, i think im going to be playing again next thursday at the bandjam so if my many fans want to come along in their 1s and 2s, they can feel free. actually, dont feel free. i might fuck up again. 
HAVE A HARDCORE CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!

"event","excuse the last entry, it has been left in the journal for prosperity, but i thought a proper entry on the happenings of yesterday was in order.
first of all i woke up about half 11 coz my little tiny cousins Ben and Anna were here, im not a big fan of children and their 6 and 9 years old, so i stayed clear of the hyperness. i went for a walk in the park with them about mid day and i saw maxxim and ralph kickin a keg in the wheir down in bourton meadow. james and pickle and heather were their 2, and aaron casme runnin over to me and decided to come back and chill at my house coz they were all drunk coz they were having an all dayer for ralphs birthday and they'd been drunk since bout 8:00 and theyd already gone and trashed burger king. 
so when aaron got back to my house he told me that i was gonna be playin guitar and singin for his new band called The Conformists at the bandjam, i was sposed to be singing god save the queen and paranoid by Black Sabbath, neither of which i knew. so i drove round to aarons in my mums car (with her their of course, coz i havenbt passed my test yet) and went and had a jam with aaron, steph came along and said we should all get wasted and listen to punk and then she went off somewhere, Ralph and pickle turned up and said that pickle and james were bein chased by police coz they went up on the roof of the uni and someone called the cops. but they made it inside safely and the cops arent lookin for them anymore.
so we carried on jammin for ages and pickle was hilarious, then joodle and stibby and andy arrived at random points and we all sat around for a while doin stuff. so then i went home and came bacxk, and me and joodle and aaron walked to the bandjam but we had to walk the long way round coz their were some townies in budgens car park that looked like they were gonna cause trouble and aareon had all his equipment with him so we walked round the back way.
and then when we got their ralph and steph and pickle and james were already their, and james was totally fucked, it was actually embarrasing. then he went home to get more alcohol, but he never came back. hes probly passed out in a gutter somewhere, and to be honest, i feel like going and kicking him.
andy and stibby were their to, and nick turned up, and then frank and ant and dave turned up, and then it was time for us to play so we got up, and i was shitting myself and i messed up the words to everything so badly, cept everyone said i did well and not to worry about it so i was cool.
so i had quite a bit to drink coz people kept buying me beer, and everyone departed evbentually and ant asked if i wanted to come for a joint with them, so we went off to daves house and got in his mini in his garage and hotboxed it, frank and ant were their and it was cool, cept ant started pukin which wasnt cool. i think dave was a bit poissed off with me but i left about half 1 and staggered home to get their about 2:00, and write the previous entry in my LJ.
merry christmas eve everyone !

"event","So today was fairly interesting, as last days of school go. 
The fickle old bitches that compose our key stage management team actually managed to let us go early! a rare kindness... although its ok, they kept half my form behind for skipping a PSHE lesson. ALL WE DID WAS EAT CHOCOLATE. ITS THE LAST DAY OF TERM. Im beginning to really, really hate this school....
Harriet gave me a Jack Daniels Poster, to go with the hip flask and jack Stibby gave me yesterday, which is pretty cool.
also i got 
From poodle:
a leopard print tiny shoe for my keyring, the potato of doom and a peice of toast made of spunge with DO NOT TRUST THE TOAST THAT HAS NO EARS written on it. Thankyou, Edward Monkton and your very interesting thoughts.
From Joodle:
a rubber chicken i named Tony. a small white face with a moveable chain nose. its cool, wlthough it distincyl worries me. a mr GrassHead :D thanks!
From Stibby:
Hip flask, JD and a funnel. WOOT!
From Emma: 
a bottle of archers and some chocolate. thanks :)

apologies that i got no-one presents... i ran out of cash. shit. IOU ALL BIG TIME FOR NEW YEAR, ok?

we went back to poodles for the surprise and everyone congregated at the retaurant, so after a while i bunged a sack on stibbys head, we shoved him in the back of JJs car and drove him the long way round to budgens car park and the eat All You Can Chinese buffet. 
Roofus and JJ got out, blindfolded him and took hgim for a quick walk round the shopping precinct while i went to check they were all up their. they were. it was embarrasing. I ran in, saw a big table full of people then realised it was them. i stopped right in front of the table, out of breath with everyone staring at me, stopped and said
""Oh- ill go and get him them.""
i have no idea what they thought was going on.
so we had a nice meal, including candles and photos. cool. maybe ill do an Ed. later with some picyatures.
so after that, i went back to Planktons house with Kt, Jonny, pete and Jason P. Oh and Andy, but hes annoying, because he got shockingly drunk on very small amounts of wine. and then he went to the pub, and his mum told him to go home. and she told me if he couldnt make it to call him a taxi. embarrasing.... i dont fucking know what he was even talking about. he staggered off home, and me and pete got put off of going to a pub and went back to Planktons work. pete got the bus home, then i walked back after me and pete actually just totally crashing out on a bench at Cromwells for ike an hour. it was insane
pete kept telling me to come for a pint with him, but neither of us could actually be arsed to move.
so i came home, n hear i am. wondering why on the last day of term, everyone is to lame to organize a decent celebration (aside from stibbys birthday, organized by yours truly.) 
frrrun. christmas soon, woo.

"event","ok i just finished off another story- told from faces point of view. it's at cleo's funeral, and involves cheesy rip offs of flogging molly lyrics. and i think i may have unconsciously taken inspiration from one of poodles storys. oh dear. but read it anyway. its called Punk Rock Angel.

<lj-cut>

It was a ""nice service"".
nice was definitely the word for it.
it was a quiet suburban cemetery, and about 40 people showed up.
their was Cleo's family, or what you could call her family. her mum and her sister, and various people who had been somehow 
involved in her home life over the past 18 years.
and everyone else was their. Steve and Liz, Al, Dave, George, Milton, Cheese, Rick, the whole gang. Even Sarah turned up,
out of some kind of mutual respect. for a whole second, she looked genuinely upset. The people who knew the reason she was 
their avoided looking in her direction or directed silent fuming stares at her.
the preist made a quick speech, the general type usually reserved for this kind of occasion.
""Cleo was a friend to some... tragic drug problem... such a shame.... too much too young... will be sorely missed.""
I felt almost sorry for the guy. he was just trying to do his job- he was being religious, trying to be nice, trying to
help, even in the face of all that had happened in his very own town. he was nice, despite everyone's effort to explain that
this is not how she would have wanted it.
The coffin was simple, black oak. their were no wreaths on top, just a single red rose, and a few other things that were 
small in size yet massive in significance.
The tinny church speakers played ""City Of Angels"" by The Distillers. Although the prospect of the song would seem 
innapropriate, it fit in perfectly. It was, for one second, a real moment, a flash to the way she thought.
and a realization that all of that was truly over.
After the ceremony I stepped outside into the late november air and felt the drizzle on my face. It was cold, and it wasnt 
that I didnt care, it wasnt that i didn't notice, it was just truly insignificant. Everything seemed insignificant. I wandered
slowly around the side of the small crematorium, past people crying and people talking. I passed Cheese and Milton and picked
up their conversation. they were both stood up against the wall, Cheese smoking and Milton turned away in disdain.
After a few seconds, Milton spoke to break the cavernous silence.
""That was a......."" he struggled for words like a mouse struggling on a rug thats being pulled from under him- ""nice 
service.""
In a flash of a rage that burnt so bright it seemed to throw the dysmal surrounding emotions into sharp relief and shadow, 
Cheese span around and pinned Milton to the wall. 
""It wasn't a nice service, you cunt. thats the fucking POINT. she told me a million times over this was NOT how she wanted
to go. she didn't want a nice preist. she wanted to pass totally un-noticed- she did NOT want to cause us more pain than
she thought she caused us in life. she certainly wouldn't have wanted this. THIS SUCKS. She didn't want to be buried here, 
around nice people, around nice things. She didn't want a nice feeling. Her whole life was lived on edge. At least pay her 
some respect and shut the fuck up.""
and with an almost visible flicker, as soon as it had come, it was gone. Cheese collapsed to his knees and was violently 
sick into a drain by Milton's feet. Milton stared straight ahead, petrified, mortified, and in slow realisation, what they
were all realising.
She wasn't coming back.
I recognized the anger. That was an anger Cheese had learnt from someone. It was an anger that came when you needed it most.
it burnt, and it flared, and it changed everything in its path with its strange beauty. it was alive, and it could never die.
Deep inside Cheese, Deep inside all of them she'd touched, lived the flare that had been Cleo's life.
Cheese had unwittingly paid the ultimate respect to Cleo, and she had spoken through him exactly what she wanted to say. 
The air felt clear now, although it smelt of vomit. 
It felt oddly satisfying. it seemed a bit more... concluded.
but not wholly.
and then the feeling hit me, the feeling, id been avoiding feeling for days and knew would hit me eventually. It was the
feeling that had been forcing me to live my life in slow motion and forcing all other feelings out of my head, leaving a 
huge empty void into which thoughts were now cascading like a huge dam bursting. Thoughts like
Was it real?
did it really happen?
did it happen, really? 
when's she coming back?
she's coming back, isnt she?
I cant wait to see her again.
i cant wait to tell her how stupid I am. can't wait to tell her how beautiful she is.
how wonderfully bright she shone. how pure. how concentrated.
and, deeper than these thoughts, and most terrible of all, lurked the darkest thought, the truth.
Like a sea monster it came, swallowing all the other thoughts inside itself and telling me
SHE ISNT COMING BACK.
and soon all the other thoughts were gone, and only the truth remained, the whole truth, and the memory of Cleo remained as
just a twinkle in the eye of the beast, a flare in the darkness, a match dropped into the abyss of my mind. And on it burned,
bright and new and wonderful, and a terribly weight descended upon my shoulders. A solitary tear escaped my eye.
My legs started walking, although i felt powerless to control them, they just moved. I left the cemetery without breaking
into a run, without even breaking into a sweat, and avoiding everyone. i avoided them all- I avoided Steve offering me a lift
home, Dave asking me to come back to his for the wake, The crying mother and sister and the unfamiliar faces. 
all that filled my head now was a few song lines;

Her eyes, they close, and her last breath spoke,
she had seen all to be seen.
a life, once full, now an empty vein,
wilt the blossoms on her early grave.
walk away, me boy, walk away, me boy.
wipe that golden tear from your mother, dear
and raise whats left of the flag for me.
Then the Rosary beads, count them 1,2,3
fell apart as they hit the floor.
In our garb of black, we must pay respect 
to the colour we're born to mourn.

Walk away, me boy, walk away, me boy
and by morning, we'll be free.
wipe that golden tear from your mother, dear
raise whats left of the flag for me.

I lost myself in an empty space somewhere between sleep and awake underneath my dirty hoody, on a dirty bench at the bus stop, mind blank, eyes staring straight at my shoes. I wasn't just deep in thought, i was devoid of thought; the only picture in my head now was her face.
The bus came and i piled on. Respectfully, and just for once, the bus driver was kind and refused to accept my bus fare when he asked me if I'd come from the funeral
of ""That nice Atkins girl."" Cleo, who was always broke, was a regular user of the blessed public transport system and so had become a familiar face to them.
I slunk to the back of the bus, wrapped in a cotton sheet, almost tripping over some old woman's shopping and sat at the back, face planted against the window facing the cemetery and staring straight ahead.
Then I saw it, just for a second, but that moment will blaze its way deep into the memories that will last until the day i join her.
The clouds parted, and a flash of blue sky was met by the perfect sillhouette etched on my retina and i saw her for what she truly was.
I knew i wasn't really seeing this, it was just a delusion, and I knew it, and this made it more beautiful. 
She had left this world but in doing this she revealed to me what she'd really been. 
She was an angel, in the purest sense of the world. She knew where she was at all times. she knew where she stood. She helped where needed, not because she was asked, but because she did. she asked no questions and expected no answers. she was sharp, clear and beautiful, and this world was not good enough for her. She was a punk rocker; she would die with the feelings of her friends, The music she lived and breathed, that feeling of injustice, that feeling of total mind numbing clarity and the greatest tragedy, she had never seen this in herself. This world truly did not deserve her.
and as i sat and stared, and a newer brighter day dawned in my mind, I smiled and remembered another line from the song

The dead rise again, you fools.

AUTHORS NOTE: 
the song is an edited version of Flogging Molly's Raise whats left of the flag for me, in my humble opinion one of the saddest songs ever written.

"event","Yesterday started off with the most hilarious thing ever.
I had a driving lesson with my driving instructor, and in my excitement to get out of the house, i locked my shoelace in the door, then realised i hadnt got a key and no-one else was in the house. cue some evry impromptu shoe destruction, then chasing aorund trying to find a key for my house. In the end, i couldnt find one, so my instructor Brian helped me break into my house by giving me a leg up onto the roof and then i scrambled through the window of my parents bedroom, who luckily always leave their windows open to let the smell of all the pot out.
I grabbed my stuff and, realising the time, tried to run to the bus stop but by half way their i was already out of breath because i seem to be getting a really bad cough. So i stopped to catch my breath and ran into pete and dave and maxim going to pauls house. i asked them if they were catchin the bus and they said yeah, theyd skate up in a second. i was like the bus should be their in like 1 minute, fuck you so i sprinted all the way up to the bus coz i could see it coming round the roundabout. then when i got their james and ralph and steph and aaron were they and we got to laugh at pete and dave and maxim tryin to skate as fast as they could up a hill and a cross a roundabout. but they did manage to catch the bus in the end.
so we got off the bus and we split with steph  and ralph, they went off toi get presents for someone, and dave and maxim and pete went off to skate up by the theatre. me and aaron and james went to HMV, then up 2 ottakas (the bookshop in MK)where aaron was to scared to actually ask the staff for stuff. HE DIDNT GET HIS DAD A PRESENT BECAUSE OF THIS. then we went to meet ralph and steph and went to the crazy german fayre thing on by the fountain in the centre. it was all crazy and german, and their were people in the full scottish shit playing bagpipes, they were pretty funny, but i was expecting The Dropkick Murphys to appear at any second. 

So then me and james went off for a joint down by the benches at the back of the church, and their were some BMX guys evilling us for some reason. Then we got followed by a bunch of traffic cops which was a bit scary for a second because i thought they were actually cops. Then we climbed a step of stairs and james said it looked like a mountain. then i said it looked like a pyramid, and i thought that the rabbis must have been religious stoners from history. and that moses was an acid head. ""yo dudes, i went up this hill, and this guy, he gave me some pills...""  sound familiar? hmm.
then we did some other things of generalur activity of which i remember fairly little, but i do remember we ended up going for a joint with dave and maxin and pete as well. so we trecked all the way back up to the benches and pete rolled (much better joints their, then) and we found some art which dave pissed off the top of. FOR AGES.
by this point i was really fucked, so it was only when we got all the way back to the bus stop that i remembered id left all my shoppinh back down at the bench. so we went back to get it, and james grumbled about it. and then when we got back, we hadnt missed the bus and we got to act stoned at the bus stop for a bit. all i really remember of that is dave saying that he hated me. a lot. and that he didnt wanna be their. i dunno whether he was serious, or annoyed, or joking, or just stoned. then we got on the bus and some        guys appeared from the train station and talked at me for a bit.
then i was reading a book on the bus but everytime i read a sentence, i forgot it instantly. this made the book really hard to read. 
when we got back to buckingham i trekked all the way to poodles for the party because i didnt really haver time to go home, so i went straight their.
I don't really remember that much, i know jason filmed everything, i remember sitting on a sofa next to bunty and going ""oggle goggle boggle gobble"" for about ten minutes for no particular reason. um, actually thinking about it i remember the followinbg things:

-what ive just said above
-the cute girl in our school. i remember dave  told her she was cute, and i agreed. we were both very sad when the cute girl left.
-i vaugely rememver something about a booze run. i dont think i was on it, though.
-i do remember pete and harriet repeatedly insisting on smoking my weed. i repeatedly told them i did not in fact have any. they really wouldnt leave me alone!
-i do remember jonny and katie turning up, and then leaving.
-i remember sorting things out with mark and cyd after their party, and much happiness was shared by all.
-pete kept knocking the stair gate over.
- emma and andy had an argument.
-something happened with emma and pete.
-joodle wasnt happy, about something. but i dont think it was my fault...
-i stole a bottle of archers due to know one else wanting it for the walk home.
- i didnt lace my boots up until i got to the bottom of bourton road.
- JJ was drinking/drunk?
- tess kept stealing my food. damn dog
- man, i really don't remember anything else.
so when i got home after the party, my key didnt work, so my mum had to get up and let me in, and she was pissed off coz i made her get out of bed at 12:30 lol.
and so ended my extraordinarily interesting day

"event","Its snowing again.
and yet again im thinking about leaving here.

I just came from parents evening, through the pouring rain.
my shoes filled up with water.
my mum thinks i should put off my driving test until ive done with school.
i think that if i do that i will never be able to escape.
she wants me to work-
i have nothing to work for.
its working at a cross purpose, neither purpose of which is mine.

still snowing, and its getting heavier.
yet another rushed meal, and in silence. seems my family 
wont even talk to these dsays. and their have been better days.
I really hate this situation, especially after recent discussions with people who shall for the now remane nameless.
I hate this- because i feel like what im thinking or whats happening to me isnt important compared to everyone else- everyone seems to be coming trumps up with more huge problems - bigger than mine and making me feel bad and whiney. But im not whining, i just wanna change things, because i dont know how much i can ""politely"" endure this situation without smashing something.
stopped snowing and now its sleeting.
the bitch and roy went bowling, and im hear with andrew. 
I should have gone to the bandjam, but i declined.
joodle intervened.

I think enough has been said.

One was a small red peice, and the second was a fucking huge ceramic bowl peice with a hash leaf painted on, and it looks very cool. But on opening the bag this time, i found that it seems the peices seem to have been having a little fun, and are proud to announce birth to their new son, A smaller red peice which was randoimly filled weith some weed i dont remember buying.

"event","13 November, Mean fiddler, London.
the time is roughly 7:30.
Phinius Gauge have just left the stage after an extremely lukewarm reception.
Solabeat Alliance come on and play Set It Off.
and then they dropped the news- this was their last gig.

This news both shocks and saddens me that we are losing a band as great as this. This band were a huge influence on my life as it is today (lame as that sounds) as they were the first band I ever saw live (Pitz Mk, with spunge and farse). And they were a big name in the scene and had a loyal but underground fanbase, an awesome album under their belts and were well set for some super tropic wildstyle world domination. 
Which makes the blow all the harder to take. and the reasons for it even harder to understand.
I, being the obsessive SBA fan i am, spotted John outside before the show started staring into space. I said hi and he said he vaugely recognized me. I ducked back under the barrier and went inside, where i bumped into TG in the toilets. ""Dude- you rock!""
""We will do very shortly.""

Stibby the twat made the mistake of running up to TG in the bar and shouting ""why, why, WHY???"" at the poor guy, who looked like a total emotional wreck. Tg said that he could carry on doing this forever, but it wasnt his choice. then he wandered off, looking miserable. 
I then spotted him, outside, trying to sell SBA tshirts to people because he really really needed the money. i felt so sorry for the poor guy.

For those of you who don't understand the reasons for my utter devestation, YOU WERENT THEIR. Their was a gig, just one point, a turning point in my life. That band were something else, something not entirely normal and totally special those few times i was lucky enough to see them. For those of you non believers, you poor misguided fools, or those who believe the band were ""OK, average"" or even ""Pretty good"" i hold nothing for you but pity, and a big fat middle finger for not truly understanding.

Thanks For The Ska Guys- wishing all of you the best of luck in whatever you move on to.

I remember when it felt like this could never end.

-Si

(p.s; other things to remember)

- Nosebleed during the Whitmore set AGAIN- fucking hell, no, i didnt get hit in the pit, I JUST GET NOSEBLEEDS!

-their was a random guy in the toilet. he wahsed your hands for you and offered you deoderant. Their was a sign above him exclaiming ""PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS OF BOREDOM""

- one of the bars at the mean fiddler smelt like puke.

- random Italians took photos with me in euston station. on being told to take down their camera tripod by a passing security guard, one of those whiley italians told him to slap his ass. 

- Spunge threw a giant beer bottle at me."

"event","yay! writaged! bonfire night with the gang- cheese. youll see. enjoy :)

<lj-cut>


it was a really cold night, and it was misty, a cold, infiltrating mist. It was mid october, the time of year when you
were just ready to start considering buying a pumpkin for halloween and staring at the fireworks and remembering how much fun
they could be.

None of this applied to Craig, though. Although he knew he was Craig, he also understood that he was no longer a Craig; his
friends, family and pretty much everyone these days new him only as Cheese. He couldn't really remember why; the name had sort of come to him, and stuck to him like a peice of unwanted gum. Not that it was even really unwanted.
The reason none of this applied to Cheese was the fact that he was well aware of the demands on local shops, grocers and vegetable markets for pumpkins at this time of year. He had, therefore, taken it upon his own personal liberty to liberate himself a pumpkin from the clutch of its dastardly allotment-owning owner, and the large, proud, orange vegetable now sat in front of him. The inside was hollowed out, and their was a cardboard toilet-roll tube jammed in the top, rather ungracefully, where the stalk had been removed. the face had been drawn on, to reasonably hilarious effect, with a black marker pen. it vaugely resembled a jack-o-lantern, - vaugely - except where the mouth was, a small wooden pipe stuck out, pointed upwards and smoking smugly to itself. the only other noticably different feature on its face was a small, basically circular hole roughly where its nose would be. 
Anyone who could be bothered to look down the toilet roll tube would have seen the inside of the pumpkin was filled with red martini- the colour of human blood.
Cheese leaned back against the side of the tent he was supposed to be sleeping in and pointed to the pumpkin bong.
""S'your toke, dude."" he swivelled the pumpkin around to George, who slowly leaned over and proceeded to pull through the cardboard tube, before uncovering the nose-hole with his finger and emptying the smoky contents of the chamber deep into his lungs, inhaling.
""nice."" he leaned back, giggled, leaned forward and repeated the motion before passing the bong onto Al. Al stared for a few seconds, then sat up at a speed that surprised all the members of the circle and took a massive toke. then he slowly settled back into his original position, and grinned. seeing this, a mass burst of giggles spread slowly round the circle.
Cheese grinned softly to himself, thinking about the contents of his massive rucksack. about ten cheap, but surprisingly large, fireworks of varying shapes and designs nestled dangerously close to each other. thats gonna be sooo fun later on.
Bringing his attention back to the present, he noticed Face . He was sitting opposite him in the circle, ignoring the bong and fiddling with the settings on his camcorder, cursing under his breath. finally he flicked it on, and focused it on Cheese.
""say something, dude.""
instead, cheese, simply picked up the bong, took a massive toke and made a funny face at the camera. Steve and Face cracked up instantly, While Rich, used to this behaviour, calmly took a shot of whisky. 
Aware that the circular motion of the circle had passed back to him, Cheese took another hit, then leapt up and crossed to the tent entrance. 
""Dude?"" called George after taking his toke, but Cheese was already back. He opened the bag and let the contents spill into the middle of the little circle. Their was complete silence for a few seconds, except for the gentling bubbling noises of Al smoking.
""YES."" Al exclaimed simply after he was finished, and picked up a large blue and red rocket, staring at it transfixed. Rich laughed softly congratulated Cheese with a handshake. Steve nodded silentely and grinned, but Face and George remained silent and slightly pale faced. 
after a couple of uneasy seconds, Face broke the uneasy silence.
""Im not doing it. not tonight.... the place'll be crawling with pigs! count me out."" he picked up his camera and swung it around to face George, who said
""No way. you guys are fucking INSANE. count me out"" after a few seconds though, he looked pleadingly at steve. 
""please dont go? we need a lift home,"" he asked. Steve shrugged, if somewhat grudgingly and accepted.
Cheese flicked an errant dreadlock out of his face and looked at around at his slightly diminished troops. Al and Rich seemed up for it, so he picked up the bag and shoved the fireworks back into it, and stood up. Al and Rich quickly followed. Cheese glared around at the other three, but without any real feeling and shrugged. 
""you guys can finish this off,"" he suggested, prodding the pumpkin with his toe. ""We'll be back soon, but you can go if you want."" and with that, Cheese turned and stepped carefully out of the clearing, Al and Rich in towe. 

After they left the little campsite, they started out into the deeper, darker parts of the wood and all three seemed to reach a unanimous decision to flick their torches on. Of course, the boys knew their was no real danger. Thats what made the danger all the more terrifying.the sounds of their feet were the only sound, made louder by the silence and the soft sounds of breathing. they pressed on quickly though the woods they had trodden through so many times before with a distinct feeling of unease. Cheese chalked it up to the Noids; Al was worried about townies or some other form of human nastiness, while Rich worried about darker things from further away places, Probably best not discussed at a time like this. But Rich was like that'; it was hardly unusual for the man who insisted aliens used to follow him home.

after a few minutes, the now rather cold and inexplicably damp trio reached the plateaux, and remembered why they had come up here. Cheese sat down heavily on a rock and looked out, deep in thought, over the sprawl below him.

The city stretched in all directions, an endless mess of suburbs and housing estates, tiny connecting streets, teaming with people. Cheese loved this place; the pace of life below him seemed irrelevant, and he could stare for hours at the hustle and bustle knowing he didnt miss it and it certainly didnt miss him. If he had known how to meditate, or some other shit like that, this would be where hed choose to do it. If and when they ever got down, he'd have to ask Kat about that.Maybe.

he pulled himself out of his half lame cosmic revery and looked at his friends.
""You guys ready?""
but Rich had already pulled 2 rockets from his bag and placed them in the soft soil in front of them. Al was doing likewise with his hefty blue rocket, which hed shoved inside a half full vodka bottle for maximum explosive effect. Cheese sighed, and started makihng a couple of fuses out of some old, lighter fluid covered shoelaces he'd bought up with him.

After a few minutes, theyd set up some form of rocket firing range, where all the rockets would be launched, one after another in quick succession, by lighting a giant fuse. Rich had suggested they hid up trees in case they got seen, but Al and Cheese had both agreed he was to stoned to make decisions and agreed this was in fact a really crap idea. Instead, they settled on the old tried and tested method of lighting the fuse and Running Like Hell. Cheese could sense the fear coming off the other two, though he knew neither would admit he was scared, just as neither would Cheese. This wasnt because they were trying to show off how hard they were; its because they could all see how fun this could be and didn't want to care about the consequences. Cheese shoved all the stuff back in the bag, lit the fuse and began to Run Like Hell.

"event","Hmmm.. sundays.
sundays always suck for me, because i have to get up early and go to karate, which i never seem to bother with these days, and even though i tried to go today my attempts were thwarted by thew fact they moved the class times. so after that, what else is their to do? all your friends are hungover, lieing in or doing family things. you cant go out in the evening, because youve got school the next day, and its probably cold. so what do you do? fight with Andrew over who gets to use the computer. play PS2. make pointlessly long phone calls to people you don't really want to talk to. try and do family things. sleep. watch tv. get told to get up and do something by your parents. tell em to fuck off.
my parents are kinda hard to deal with, especially when my mums pissed off and bitchy with everyone, including me, roy, my brother, louise and any other random things she sees. and roy is an ignorant dick who wanders around in a dressing gown, wreaking of pot and XXX strong mints, singing badly and shouting at me and my brother. (this isnt some kind of joke entry and id rather you treated it seriously- this is a really fucked up family.)So between the yelling at each other and fucking things up, my mum decides to try and take me for a driving lesson in the dark round tescos car park, to disaster. i nearly hit a supply lorry, got hassled by a security guard and then have my mum that she refused to insure me on her car even though my test is in december. !!! she basically told me she couldnt see the point in me driving, while all i could think was, if i could drive, id be out of this shithole faster than a rat out of a crackhouse. (wow, thats a whole new expression.)

"event","Morning chums,
Was muchly enjoying the show at the Pitz in MK last night with Mercury league (whose frontman is as much of a NOFX fan as me!), The Mingers (with the hottest female singer ever. we considered cloning her- but she hates The Distillers for some reason.), The Filaments, who were expectedly KickAss, and causing the best pit of the night to Bastard Coppers. woo! and Freaks Union just rocked- they have the best atmosphere and their the coolest guys. Although their was only 100 people their, it was a great crowd, full of punks and even a bunch of little kids. Which brings me to the subject of the hilarious old man- mr 77 Revivalism! this guy must have been about 50, wandering around in a stranglers tshirt shouting anarchy! and pushing little kids over. what a twat- way to much to drink and being an old man coupled together didnt really work. Oh well! 

Am off up city now to go and do things... um

schlaters!

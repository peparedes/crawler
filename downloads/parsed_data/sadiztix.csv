Were only making plans for nigel
We only want whats best for him
Were only making plans for nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand
And if young nigel says hes happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work
Were only making plans for nigel
He has his future in a british steel
Were only making plans for nigel
Nigels whole future is as good as sealed
And if young nigel says hes happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work
Nigel is not outspoken
But he likes to speak
And loves to be spoken to
Nigel is happy in his work
Were only making plans for nigel"

"event","okay long life update

so my script for serequel was renwed

anxiety is a little less nowdays
i have to watch my caffine and stress level in accordance

though my dose is very small
so none of the bad side effects are likely to be involved
though i can no longer drink myself stupid though i haven't really done that in years

everything in moderation i guess

i'll hopefully if all goes well will be getting a new vehicle well not new but new to me
and finally get away from THE CAVALIER OF DOOM, to a more fun Pathfinder of doom
though will be nice to have the lugging space if i end up doing shows again like i promised myself

oh yeah i guess more of a band update it looks like we've been granted recording time at creative space studios in windsor
so some new songs might be put down in the near future i'm optimistic about the project again
and i'm also happy that i'll be able to finish the smog eater ep aswell sometime this year

i'll be going to see allisa soon for 5 days and i can't wait
i really miss my wife
she's the best

and MAN DO I NEED SOME SEXINGS


so yeah that's my life work is work
bills are bills

driving back from waterloo this early this afternoon
at around 4pm i was passing through london
driving through the storm

slowed down traffic a little bit
i hit around 80 and kept strolling through

as a semi was passing me and throwing tons of sluge and snow
my right side wheels slipped and spun out
from the far left lane and into oncoming traffic in a 380
needless to say i'm still here
i slid all the way into an offramp exit start
that's probably the only reason the second semi in the far right lane missed me


i started the car again and drove on the off ramp
and sat there in the truck stop around the corner
very shaken"

Detroit Chemical Plant Explosion
Waste
Zug Island
Dirty&Clean  *will probably be re-titled once i think of something better*
The Oceans of Sadness *actually that being a new song is really a big lie, i've had the idea for that one lying around since 97', only things i'm seeing are becoming progressivley worse, and it's now tied to personal/friends/and family life*

""all my friends are dead or dying, slowly in the oceans of sadness, drink the water-breathe in the air, don't start to fret when you lose you're hair, it's a dreadful state of affairs, when the guilty never seem to care, it's in our nature to kill ourselves, it's in our nature to kill ourselves, it's in our nature to kill ourselves, it's in our nature to kill ourselves.

we are the children of the waste
slowly dying in this place
it doesn't matter if they mask the taste
it's in our bodies exterminating our race""


not quite final but it gives you an idea
i'm sure once the music is done it will be much more impacting
it's kinda like tool meets puppy ish sound


not sure if there mi trax or sm trax
it's kinda wierd
stuff i'm doing for smog eater would do well in mainline
and vice versa
i think i'm just becoming more focused on what i'd actually like to rant about
in lyric writing, than just making shit rhyme, fuck that noise

things are going decent at work, gearing up for x-mas shoppers already.

i've been really fucking bored as of late though
now that lise is gone
there's not really anyone close to hang out with and whatnot

aside from adam i don't really have any friends in town
so i'm probably going to be making more windsor day trips

and some rather childish shit resulted from some innapropriate behaviour

1. time, my department just fired 2 people and i had to pickup the sunday morning shift, i.e. could not get drunk and enjoy myself.
2. allisa's younger brother just got dumped by his first serious gf and the kid needed someone to talk to (the kid is already on depression medication and really needed help).
3. allisa's mom was out of town so i had to make sure her sister and brother had rides to work for the weekend.
4. a situation with my mother and sister phone tagging bullshit back and forth to me and stressing me out even futher.
5. all of wich errupted in a few minutes of each other between 7:45 and 9 saturday evening.

now there's some bullshit and issues about loyalty

had anyone had loyalty in windsor
THE BAR WOULD NOT BE CLOSED!

anyways there should be no speculation, when i phoned derek and said i'm not coming i've got too much stuff on my plate, give charlie my best. it wouldn't really merit the 45min drive there and back that eveneing just to have 1 drink,wich would never happen because as everyone knows me + charlie + ouzo = claude's tanked and trying to curse in greek.

regardless bringing in my wife to be wich had nothing to do with me showing up
and belittling her and treating her like that will not be tolerated
grayson i've turned a cheek once again, please don't repeat this unnaceptable behaviour"

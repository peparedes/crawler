"event","So today I actually had an <u>hour</u> long meeting about my supervisor evaluation.<br />Everything was good except they said I needed to be <em>more proactive and assertive</em> about getting things to do.<br />Trust me dudes - I <strong>did</strong> that at the beginning of the term and I never had anything. After a month of asking for work and getting nothing, you kind of get into a habit of just sitting and waiting for somebody to notice you and give you work.<br /><br />They also brought up an <em>interesting point</em> (they added it to my eval too) - Kettering should either make the companies provide a work objective before the student's start their jobs each work term, or we should be hired based on the company's objective for us.<br />I kind of like it. It makes sense to tell students what they are probably going to be doing over the term, since that probably would have not turned me against Keykert so quickly...but I don't know.<br /><br />Once again though, they had all these comments to make about how I should do this and act like that and that this way would be better. They kind of acted like Kettering was a stupid school too. Oh well. <strong>I'm just glad I'm not coming back</strong>. Probably the only people that will semi-miss me will be Joel/Steve/Mike/Chonita in the test lab, and the Prototype guys who like joking around with me.<br />Maybe I'll stop by the Prototype shop for the big potluck lunch on the way back from dropping Lissett off at the airport.<br />If I can get it done, I'm going to write a letter to Mike thanking him for the opportunity and all that jazz...<br /><br />But OH! I forgot to mention yesterday in my first post in awhile...<br /><strong>I got my ears pierced again!</strong> Another hole in each ear...they itch like <em>crazy</em> (I got them done a week ago) but hopefully they are going to heal soon and I'm excited about them. I think this next term I'm going to go to Acidworks and at least get my cartilage done b.c I like cuff earrings. I might get another tattoo also, but getting one done during the winter just doesn't sound very appealing to me.<br /><br />But I thought these next 2 days were going to be <u>relaxing</u> but they found something else annoying and <em>not-needing-brain-usage</em> task for me to do. I get to redo all these graphs and stuff (it'll actually only take me about 2 hours) but I'm sure they're going to complain when they find out I can't export the data points. They'll just have to deal with it. I guess it's an ok thing that I've got this to do though...I was getting <strong>bored</strong> playing the same three games on my Google homepage and reading random things on <a href=""http://www.progressiveu.org/blog/kellyjo8"">Progressive U</a>.<br /><br />OK though, I guess I'll start on those graphs, and finish eating my lunch, and check some e-mail. You know, the same thing I do everyday here.<br /><br />Only <em>12 hours</em> of work left!"

"event","Oh all the things the Firewall blocks at Keykert, blogs aren't one of them. I find that ironic.<br /><br />So I haven't gotten on here for awhile (obviously). <strong>But things sure have changed!&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />As a quick update, <strong>I <em>passed</em> all my classes last term</strong>&nbsp;and am only .02 away from a 3.0/4.0. Which is slightly frustrating since most scholarships want you to have a 3.0, but I'll survive. Hopefully, I'll be able to get it up a little higher after this next school term.<br /><u><strong>Joe &amp; I are doing great</strong></u> :) It's like he's this other part of me that I've been missing. It's kind of odd how much alike we think.<br /><strong>This is my last term at Keykert USA</strong> - <em>I finish on Friday @ 10am</em> (I have to take one of the pledges to the airport) and I've already found another co-op job. The exciting thing is that it's with <u>Pratt &amp; Whitney in Lansing</u>, and that they gave me housing so I'll get to have an apt! woo! That means that I demand all of you who actually read this to come visit once I start there in April. I'll actually get to hang out with my handful of MSU friends too!<br /><strong>Sorority life is moving smoothly</strong> so far...I got a lot of Finance stuff done this work term since I never had a consistent amount of work, and our sisterhood is pretty stable. We are losing a few girls who aren't graduating from KU, but they made smart choices for them, and they'll still be considered sisters with us anyway :) We've only lost one pledge, and I think it was the right choice for her because I don't know if she totally fits in with us. I love her, but I don't think she'd fit in with some of the other sisters. We'll see what she decides to do!<br /><br /><strong>I also found a new blog site.</strong> It's really cool, you can check my part of it here: <a href=""http://www.progressiveu.org/blog/kellyjo8"">http://www.progressiveu.org/blog/kellyjo8</a>. The only complaint I have about it is that you can't do cool colors and stuff like you can on here, but I guess the stuff that's talked about on that blog is a little bit more heady than what I usually post on here.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't know who still reads this, but I think I'm going to make an effort to post at least once a week on this, since I feel like I've been neglecting you guys. If I don't - EMAIL me and demand that I post!<br />"

"event","This week has been hectic to say the least. It's nice to actually be able to breathe.

Monday was about the only day when I didn't have something to do for A Phi...I went to class and work and then I watched FIJI kick ass in football, and then I ran 5 miles. 4th mile my left knee, of course, buckled and luckily that was the side of the sidewalk I was on so I fell on grass. Knocked the wind out of me for a second, but I finished hard and iced my knees and they feel better finally now that it's the end of the week.

Tuesday I had class once again and then I got my pin :-) I'm wearing it right now b.c we dressed up today so that we could wear them. But anyway...during pinning Becky (my big sis) gave me a light brown bear with soccer cleats, a black skirt, and green bows. It was very personalized and creative. We practiced really quick for Preference and then I went down to the green house to watch 'Requiem for a Dream.' I carried my bear <img src=""http://images.neopets.com/items/teddybear_giftshop.gif"" alt=""Teddy Bear"" /> the entire night :-) But that movie is weird and definitely makes you appreciate the life you have and never makes you want to try drugs EVER. Joe grabbed me at a scary part, so I smacked him and gave him the silent treatment for 10 mins b.c I HATE when people do that b.c then everybody else laughs at you. But oh well. He made up for it with cuddling :-)

Wednesday was Junior Halfway (sweet, I'm halfway done!) so I drank during the day after I got up and I have a sweet lime green cup to remember it by...I helped set up the room for Preference for about 30 mins and then I had to go to class...and then after I got out of class we had football <img src=""http://www.diegotorres.com.ar/mensajeitor/foro/caritas/050103ball_prv.gif"" alt=""American Football"" /> practice before our game at 9:30...we played the Freshman and won 7-6. Bullcrap in my opinion. We should have wasted them. I won't say anything about it b.c somebody will get annoyed or hurt by my comments and then I will get 'in trouble.'  Whatever. Mommy came so that was cool.

Thursday I had class (didn't go to SSCI 201). I went to the Up Till Dawn event during lunch. Bought 2 raffle tickets and won 'The Girl Next Door' and a $15 gas card, so that was cool. Then later that night we had our Preference Party for Alpha Phi...all the girls we invited showed up! It was exciting.  Then we cleaned up for that and I went to FIJI to spend the night and cuddle. He's such a great guy. 

Today Tamara and I went to lunch with the ELC and talked about some stuff. I think Tamara was glad to talk to her about what we talked about...and I <img src=""http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/h/heart.gif"" alt=""Heart 2"" /> our ELC...she is so cool! After lunch I finished up with class and then missed seeing Joe b.c I was dumb and forgot that I was supposed to wait for him outside before his Fluids class...then I drove to the bank and post office and when I got back Tamara and I left to go get stuff for Bid Day! We got some really cute things :-) and then we went to dinner at Applebee's with Joe, Lesko, Dave, and Marcin. So I got to see Joe before he left for the weekend for the FIJI retreat. I hope that they have fun and that it doesn't rain.  Then A Phi had our birthday party so we learned sfootbome new songs from the ELC and had fun...then Becca, Jessica, Samantha, and I watched 'The Girl Next Door.' I love that movie! Now I'm going to bed.

peace and love!

Everybody but Becca got naked and were skinny dipping in the Flint River.<br />Then we ran to the green house and all got in the pool and made 2 Eiffel Towers...<br />Then we stopped and did a chinese fire drill with Jon carrying Becca and Michelle and Joe humping a orange barrel with a construction hat on.<br />Then we went back to FIJI and all sat on the toilet and gave each other wet willies...and we went to the kitchen and Jon got naked under an apron and Michelle put her legs behind her head.<br /><br />We ended up with about 15000 points...and second place had 10000 ;-) We rock.<br /><br />Jon was afraid that Joe was going to kill him but it's all good b.c we weren't really kissing. We just made it look super convincing.<br /><br />After all that business, we got ready and had fun at the green house.<br /><br />Now I'm waiting for Mom and Golden Gram to get here for Parent's Day!<br /><br /><em>ps - i'll post pictures when i get them</em>"

I like them a lot :-)<br />Then while we were waiting to go to the drive-in, I walked across to the CC and talked to Kurt, Brent, Katie, Nelson, and Rob...I showed them Angelina...and then we went to the drive-in by my house and saw Pirates of the Caribbean - it was good - and then left b.c that movie was really long and I didn't really want to watch Stick It.<br />So after that, we got ready and walked to the green house to party...Michelle and I decided to get into their pool...I was going to just step in but no, Joe decided it was necessary to pick me up and jump in with me. I wasn't complaining too much ;-) and after being in the pool for awhile Joe and I rinsed off. Then I was tired so Michelle and I walked back with Pokie and Joe and we went to bed.<br /><br />Saturday, Becky, Samantha, Becca, Joe and I got up and ran...it was horrible. I sucked it up big time b.c I was dehydrated and have turned into a weakling since high school...so Becca, Joe and I ran about 4 miles and Becky &amp; Samantha ran 7 miles. After Becky got back, she, Becca and I went to her house to lay out in the pool and try to get tan. Her dog Madison is totally adorable :-) Then we came back and went to the Farmer's Market...I got green beans and cheese and croissants...then we came back &amp; I made my chicken supreme after a few mishaps (like having to get more chicken and not really sure if I was reading the recipe right). We had to wait to eat it though b.c we had to go to practice our thing for Mock Rock and then we had Mock Rock...<br />FIJI's performance was <u><strong>awesome</strong></u> and probably ill become a legend. If I get a video for it I'll post it :-)<br />Then after Mock Rock we ate the most delicious dinner ever and dolled up and then traveled to the Pike house for Fluids Lab...it was ok but the house was really hot.<br />So then we were driven back by Richie and almost died multiple times...and then we walked to the green house and had fun there...flippy cup with half cups is hard but the girls beat the guys each of the 4 games. It was awesome :-)<br />Joe walked me back to the apts and we fell asleep.<br /><br />Now it's today &amp; I have a crap ton of homework to do so I'm going to get on that :-)<br />peace."

It has been so long since I've had a crush that turns out to be a great guy. Most of the time I get a crush and he may look good on the outside, but then he does something stupid or lets his inside thoughts out and it totally disgusts me.

But this time I think it's different.

I just wish I wasn't so shy...I could talk to any other guy on Kettering's campus more easily than I can talk to him...and it's all because I like him a lot and it'd be great if he liked me back...

Plus I am horribly out of practice with the whole flirting thing. 

Oh well. Maybe I'll come up with something.

"event","haha.<br />so yesterday I got nothing done...unless you count having a completely <strong>awesome </strong>fun time :-)<br />First, I ran the Tuuri 5K yesterday at 7:30am and then waited while Becky &amp; Samantha ran the 10K race...<br /><br />I looked at the times yesterday and I ran it in 31:50. Pretty decent if you take into account that I have some kind of sinus infection, was dry heaving the entire race, and can't sleep b.c the bed in my apt is so damn hard.<br /><em>This is the really weird thing:</em><br />I'm in the 16-19 age group, so theoretically b.c I am the oldest out of everybody in that age group and most people who do road races in the younger half of the age group are cross country runners, you would think that with a 31:50 I would have been maybe 6th or 7th, depending on how many runners actually ran the race.<br />Just goes to show you that the one above works in strange ways.<br />I got <u>3rd place</u> in that age division with a 31:50. How crazy is that? So I get a <em>trophy </em>:-)<br /><br />Anyway, after the race, the three of us came back to campus and had to walk over to the rec center to shower b.c the apts didn't have water yesterday due to the bridge construction. So we did that and then we went to our philanthropy event at the <strong>Flint Cultural Center</strong>. I supervised the brain teasers room...some of them were pretty hard but I solved a few :-)<br /><br />After that, Becky, Mellissa, and I were going to go out to the beach with the Pikes but when we called they said they wouldn't have the boat much longer so we decided not to go to that...and then Becca popped her head in and asked if we wanted to go to the beach with Fiji, so we went there b.c it was closer to school and they had only been there an hour. So we made our way there (after much disgruntlement at the vague directions) and played volleyball and water football and both teams I was on won :-)<br /><br />Then we came back and I hung out upstairs b.c nobody was in my apt. We watched 'Rumor Has It' and part of 'The Sixth Sense' and then we got ready and went to the green house to party. There was a party at the GDI house but b.c of certain issues, Becca, Christina and I decided that we didn't want to go.<br /><br />So a big group of us played Kings (which is way fun) and then we had to leave b.c of other circumstances...but over all it was a good night. A <em>little lonely</em> in the end b.c nobody was here when I came back to my room to sleep but no biggie. I was passed out from medicine and my buzz...I didn't even notice that somebody had turned the air conditioning off, so it has a little hot when I got up. Luckily Tamara was up before me and noticed when she came back.<br /><br />That'd be the update in a nutshell. I need to <strong>hardcore </strong>get some homework done and clean my room up a bit and possibly do laundry if there is someplace open.<br /><br />aoe<br /><br />PS - I am in desperate need of some new music so if anybody wants to send me some song files that would be appreciated:-)"

Jackson yelled at me for not writing.
<u>dreadfully sorry old chap.</u> ;)

I have enjoyed my 2 months off immensely.
At the beginning of my last summer vaca, I graciously helped the high school JV team out.
Now, most of you are probably thinking...
<i><b>WHY DID YOU GO BACK?</b></i>
simple answer: b.c I miss being active.
It's all fine & dandy with running (which I sadly say I have taken a break from, if you can notice my ""love handles""), but I miss soccer. IM co-ed just didn't cut it at State. Especially b.c <u>SOMEONE</u> who I won't name (BRICAULT) didn't pick up the finals schedule so we only played maybe 5 games. >:O

Ah well, that time is over.
So anyway, helping the JV team was enlightening, helped me start my tan, & gave me something to DO!
Always a problem for me, b.c if I don;t have an activity, I just sit, ""lose muscle"" & read.
Which I have been doing a lot of...reading.

Read the whole Dragonriders series by Anne McCaffrey, re-read some Mercedes Lackey, re-read Harry Potter (B.C THE 6TH BOOK COMES OUT IN 3 WEEKS!) <--<i><u><b>very excited</b></u></i>

I finally broke into the retail industry with a job at <b>Express</b> in Genesee Valley...so 2 days a week I am occupied. You should all come visit as we are having a <u>HUMONGOUS SALE</u> & in a few weeks we're getting our <i>new jeans in</i> :) I get to see Bridget at the Pretzel Peddler sometimes, too. :)

I start at <b><u>Kettering</u></b> in a sad week...my summer vaca is disappearing. yay for getting a <i>lovely</i> schedule class-wise, even if I am going to HATE having an 8am class! Will is a DTD now & still ""angelic"" even if he does tend to pick me up whenever I decide to beat him up. Yay for 11 months today!

As for today, I started a great purge in life.
<i>NO I DID NOT TURN BULIMIC. disgusting.</I>
<b>I cleaned my room.</b>
yes, I packed all my books in boxes, cleared off the tops of my dressers & desk, hauled everything out except my bed, vacuumed...my mom & I are astonished at what came out. It's incredible.
Let's just say that if anybody in your family is younger & enjoys reading...bring them over b.c <u>I have a good 6 boxes of books to sell. & tons of clothing.</u>

Tis all for now. I expect comments!!!!! :)"

Anyway,
woohoo for 3.5 weeks left!
engineering project is 1/2 way done, last chem test monday, last french test was yesterday.
still finalizing everything for my transfer :\

Will is in OH now, going out of his mind & complaining that he's fat b.c he has nothing to do...
We are going to the Sparty's Spring Party up here on the 16th though. supposed to be good bands :)

Tomorrow I am running in a 5K @ U of M for the ""intercollegiate running clubs.""
I'm pretty sure that I'll be running 10min mile pace b.c I just started running consistently last week.
Although yesterday it was nice at running club b.c I met the grad student & he ran with me even though I'm sure he was like ""dear god, she's slow!""
That's what happens when you run with a marathoner ;)
So, because of this race, I'm staying here for the first time this semester. Not very excited b.c I'm sure that tonight, tomorrow after the race, & sunday I will be bored out of my mind.
It also stinks b.c I need new books but since, I'm not going home, I can't go to the library so I think I'm going to have to <i><b>buy</i></b> them...

getting closer & closer to the $200 mark in my quest to pay my mom back for the tuition deposit...

I need a summer job. desperately. so if you think you can get me in somewhere, please help me.
I would like something that I can feel ""busy"" at, so that I'm not bored out of my mind like I am with reffing up here.
Hopefully someplace that will get me a good discount ;)

Becky woke up this morning & did her Denise Austin: Hips, Thighs, & Buttocks tape...I was sad b.c I couldn't join. Had chemistry.

I am soooooo burned out with school. I think I'll like Kettering a lot, with it being closer to home, smaller, & being able to switch between school & work once I get to the point where I'm getting burned out with one or the other.

I decided that I'm going to make an effort to run everyday this summer, & to take Shadow on a walk everyday too. He's getting old, but I think that exercise will make him a little bit perkier & it will be good for him. It'll be good for me too b.c maybe that way I'll actually be able to do well in the 2 road races I do during the summer, although this year they'll both be during my time @ KU.

mmmmm...can't think of anything else...so peace."

why do people not believe me when I say stuff?

don't they realize how hard it is not to be indignant when people are so <i>excited</i> to go through ""the ghetto"" on the way to a field trip WHEN THEY HAVE NO IDEA?
yea sure, some of you are asking why I think I am the authority on this...& most of my friends think that me living & going to school in Downtown Flint could not have affected me that much...

you try being in kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade...& coming home crying b.c black people made fun of you for being white...& a black lunch lady with long witch fingernails yells at you in front of everyone b.c they moved the spoons & you couldn't find them so you were eating your yogurt with your finger...& having to wait after school to go home b.c some horrible person kidnapped someone & held them hostage with a gun across the street from your school...& being scared for your g-ma b.c they found dead bodies in the backyard of a house a block away...& then coming to Kearsley where it seemed like nobody understood you b.c you were so different b.c you didn't act like a ""normal"" white person...

maybe that gives everyone an idea of why I get so mad about how people think they're ""cool"" when they try & imitate how they think black people are like...& they are so far off...

Most of the people who have that attitude have no idea what it is like...they just assume that what is on TV is reality, when reality is much worse.

I guess I just don't understand how people can think that they are better then someone else because of race...
if you wanna be like Hitler then go for it...I hope when you try & take over the world you suicide too...if you wanna be like the people who started slavery then go for it...I hope the same repercussions happen to you...
If you wanna be in my life & feel the need to purposefully be like that...
then don't try b.c you won't be accepted."

My handsome man is now a member of Delta Tau Delta - Epsilon Iota A,
& I am now about 85% sure that I want to go to Kettering.

So...
Friday I did go to EX...I couldn't stay very long b.c of the co-op conference & my obligation to be there by 8am...& it wasn't very fun while I was there :-\ the foam wasn't working.
On a sadder note, apparently Will was out of i-week at about 9pm Friday, & tried to call my mom's but couldn't get through b.c she was talking to g-ma :-( so I didn't get to see him until Saturday after the conference...
It was a fun weekend b.c I had him all to myself. :-) I can be a selfish person sometimes.

Then Sunday I had to come back here to waste my life away doing pointless things...
I finally got that huge lab report done that is due Thurs, but I still have to find info for the chem group project & my stupid french oral presentation...

but one & a half months till I am out of here.
peace.

Although Sean & Mag made me miss Will more :\

Will...if there is any way that you could be reading this (which is pretty unlikely) I hope that you will remember to ask somebody to accompany me to a water polo game...b.c I really wanna go.
I also hope that you got my letter that I sent you...& I'm mailing another one tomorrow :)

Tomorrow I'm going to Novi (Plato's Closet & Forever 21) & then to Becky's soccer game.
yay for another pretty busy day.

Can't decide if I should go to the Sigma Chi party, since I have to be at Kettering the next morning at 8am...
maybe I'll go for a couple hours just to say hi & stuff...
maybe Will is going...probably not though...it seems like he has shunned Sig Chi...
<font size=""-2"">earlier this week it also felt like he didn't want to s[end time with me this weekend if it was possible but ya never know...he prob. was just trying to not get my hopes up in case I didn't get to see him</font>

The Notebook was ok...didn't really watch it b.c I was doing other things, but the roomie had it on so I caught some glimpses.

Will & I are not talking right now which is sad b.c it's my fault & I'm too damn selfish & I need to talk to him as much as possible since I won't be able to next week.
I accept this.
I need to learn to grow up...

Awesome sale at Target this week...going Friday or Saturday I think...one of the many things I have created to occupy time during Spring Break.
Others include:
 - catching up on sleep, if I can
 - spending a day (or days) @ U of M with Mag & Kari
 - working out with Mag (?)
 - seeing Becky play soccer
 - cleaning my room
 - painting my room
 - running (2x a day possibly)
 - walks with Shadow
 - maybe something with Melanie but not sure yet
 - writing letters to Will if it's allowed
 - going to the Kettering bookstore to spend my $15 Got-Used gift card
 - reading / visiting the library to see if I can find another author I like
 - maybe seeing Will play Water Polo (if one of his future brothers wants to take me)
 - figuring out what the heck to wear for the Co-op Conference @ Kettering 3/12
 - destroying / editing my resume
 - doing my giant lab report, french composition / workbook / presentation, & getting info for my chem group project
 - getting my hair cut / playing with my hair
 - getting sketch pencils for ME180
 - helping Mom with her after school thing
 - finishing the weight machine & using it
those are not necessarily in order of when I'm going to do them...but they're all ideas I have of stuff that I can do...

I know Will is going to have fun with the Delts & get to know them a lot better
he'll probably have so much fun that he won't even miss me that much...which is awesome :)

peace. acceptance.

PS - if somebody can tell me what my ""mood fox"" is supposed to be doing, it would be greatly appreciated"

so I'm very angry at the Delts right now.
Now, I understand why they want the pledges, when they live in house, to spend as much time as possible focusing on the fraternity & their future brothers...
but WHY MAKE IT NEXT WEEK??
a lot of schools are off for Spring Break...INCLUDING MSU...
& now my Spring Break is going to be one of the worst b.c I can't see Will.
There goes...
  1. the double date to the comedy club with Mel & Joel
  2. seeing Becky play soccer together
  3. getting to see Kettering life during the school day
  4. spending lots of time with Will
  5. getting to watch him play Water Polo
  6. one of the funner Spring Breaks I've ever had

Thank you Delta Tau Delta...

Now I just have to figure out why Life has decided to make Spring Break dumb...

PS - Frank, thanks for the offer...but why would I want to come to the house to see you, knowing that Will is there & I can't talk to him?

Happy 7 Months :*"

very ""interesting"" I must say...I think that if the teachers that are requiring you to watch them are falling asleep themselves while watching them - you have a problem.

Sat I was late (sorry) & Will & I ""missed"" the first 2 movies...so we went to GV to get my ring resized...it'll be done next weekend :) & to Sam's Club for groceries...yummy Oreo's & Cheeto's :D

SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY???
Will, Mike, Morgan & I went to Frankenmuth for the Snowfest...it would have been awesome except that for the past 4 days or so it's been about 40 degrees...so there were no cool ice sculptures left & the snow ones were pretty melted...the excursion turned into a shopping trip :)
I bought 3 slices of fudge (mmmmm) <font size=""-2"">they were having a special buy 2 get 1 free</font>
We went into all these stores & they had pretty glass figurines...
however the shop that topped them all was called 'The Horse Crossing'

now, for those of you who have not had witness to my collections...I enjoy everything horses :)
at the shop, I was in heaven...& if ecstasy can be added to that feeling...I felt it.
Because they had MODELS of the PAINTED PONIES.
How many of you remember that big art thing they had at the beginning of high school were they had all these artists take large horse sculptures & make them into art?
I remembered & I have always wanted to go & see them...

Well, now thanks to my fabulous boyfriend :*
I now have one of my own!! :D
no, it's not the life-size ones (dear Lord do you know how much those probably cost?)
I have a model of the ""Heavenly Pony""
it's so pretty...& I have now started a new ""sub""-collection of horses :)

I was convinced that I'd never stay in a relationship that long...
but then I met William :D

well anyway...
I'm horrid at giving him presents b.c I have never had to give a boy a present...
but I told him that his present was going to dinner & that it would be a surprise
I made him dress up too (he was soooo :* cute) The blue shirt really brings out his eyes...
but I decided that we were going to go to Outback Steakhouse, since he loves steak & I think I'm part Australian ;)

Anyways we had to wait an hour b.c we didn't get there until about 8:00pm
we were REALLY hungry!
but we finally got seated...
we ordered the Aussie cheese fries (very good) & the Outback special (also very good)
Then we went back to Kettering & watched a movie & cuddled...e ove im :)

Saturday I did laundry & stuff & then Will came & got me so that we could go to his parent's house in Marlette...
His mommy made a yummy dinner of sloppy joes & that nacho cheese/meat sauce (I LOVE THAT STUFF)
Then we played with the 2 doggies Jewel & Maggie & the monster puppy Reggie (who is 3 months old & almost as big as my dog!)
We rented Friday Night Lights & watched it (kinda) with his parents...it was ok :)

Sunday was his sister's b-day party...mmm venison :D
I really like his family :) I enjoy spending time with them as much his uncle & grandpa tease me :P

We had to leave early b.c Will had to be back for his pledge meeting...& I got to State earlier than I wanted :\
but oh well.

That's about it...
engineering is about the only class that I TRULY enjoy...which may be a good sign :)

oh...the book that was messed up that I had the bookstore order a new one...the new book was messed up the same way...so she ordered another one for me & let me exchange the first book for another book...I hope the next book is a good one!!

Anyway, Will surprised me Friday the 12th with a dozen pink roses & said that he had made a terrible mistake & wanted another chance.
he's so adorable.
We had a great weekend together.
Saturday we went to the MSU/Wisconsin game...it ROCKED!!! It was my first football game & we smashed Wisconsin...& <b>all you Michigan fans out there better appreciate it b.c MSU & Iowa got you to the Rose Bowl.</b> A couple hours after the game we went to Bennigans & I got my Blackout cake...<i>mmmmmmmmmmmm</i>
Sunday we went to my cousin Shae's birthday party...it was enjoyable b.c I beat him in pool & we played Scattergories :P Then he had to leave so that was sad :(

The next week went by pretty fast...the most exciting part was my last day of Chem Lab on Wed...OH FABULOUS DAY!

Then that weekend he came up & we stayed at my dad's...
Saturday we went to UofM Flint with Kari to watch the Michigan/OSU game...*cough* no comment. We also went to the Genesee Fieldhouse (aka the Dome) to watch the Kearsley Varsity Girls play soccer...& we went to SoccerZone to watch Tamryn play soccer...I love her...my Dad's gf is friends with her parents, who came here from South Africa to escape apartheid...
Sunday we lazed around & then he took me back to MSU & left to go back to OH.

This week was filled with insane studying for my calc 2 test Tuesday, which I think wasn't that bed & I'm hoping it will bring my grade up above a 2.0 so I can stop worrying so much...Then Wed sucked cuz I had to go to BOTH my classes, when almost everybody else had gotten them canceled :( I biked back to Holmes through the starting flakes of the snow...it's really pretty out right now but I can just imagine what hell it's going to be like today & tomorrow...

Will came up to see me Halloween weekend *insert humongously insanely large smile here*
<u>FRIDAY</u>
He came up Friday night & we went to the Haunted Union...which was not scary at all...rented Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Jeepers Creepers, & The Sixth Sense to watch.  He bought me ice cream too. :)
We watched Texas Chainsaw before we went to bed...I just don't like that movie, it's creepy...then we slept. 
<u>SATURDAY</u>
We got up & got ready Saturday morning & went to his parent's house for a dinner before his grandparent's left for Texas for the winter...good food!  His grandparent's brought his b-day present & X-mas presents for the family...I wasn't expecting anything but they ended up getting me these cute X-mas cards with kittens on them...it was cool. :) We watched the U of M / MSU game...it went into a third OT (wow) & the only reason MSU lost was b.c Drew Stanton got hurt...then Will & I went down & watched the other 2 movies & went to bed since we had to get up for church the next day.
<u>SUNDAY</u>
We got up early, had pancakes for breakfast, & went to church...haven't been to church in awhile...I dunno. Then we went to his other grandparent's house to celebrate his sister Missy's b-day...we ate some good food there & then we had to leave so we could get back to State before he had to come back to OH...we stopped at my Mom's on the way to grab some stuff & so he could say hi.  Then we got back here & I had to do my lab report so he stayed for that & we enjoyed each other's company for a bit more & then he left me again...
<u>MONDAY</u>
I went to class & then my mom & g-ma came to get me...hung out at home, went to my brother's band banquet...
<u>TUESDAY</u> - <b>ELECTION DAY!!</b>
I got up Tuesday morning & got ready then went & voted FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! I waited in line for 2 hours...& yes, I voted for Kerry...& even though he lost, it's ok...I just hope Bush can lead this country for the next four years...I am mad that Proposal 1 & 2 passed...I don't think it's cool that the Indian casinos now have a possible monopoly on gambling, & that the State has the power to decide where gambling type things can go...& Proposal 2 is just stupid b.c it basically said that the only thing allowed now is marriage b.tw a man & a woman...people were so concerned with being discriminatory & banning gay marriage...well you're all jerks & I hate you for it...<i>who gives you the right to discriminate against your fellow man????</i>
<u>WEDNESDAY</u>
I had an insanely hard math test this morning...pretty sure I failed it.  Started studying for an insanely hard conceptual-only chem test...which I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail too...

damnit all I want to do is pass freakin college & get a job so I can pay for school, & actually LIKE it here...
meh."

"event","so...
stayed at State for the first time since starting college this weekend...figured I might as well see if MSU is all it's cracked up to be.  My ""what I did"" follows.

<u>FRIDAY</u>
Becky (my roommate) & I were very bored all day...I had class until 2:40 & then I couldn't talk to Will b.c he went to Mike's house for the weekend...Kim (one of my suitemates) went home for the weekend so Becky, Tina (the other suitemate) & I went to this comedy thing with a woman from VH1 and the winner & runner-up of Last Spartan Standing (a spinoff of Last Comic Standing).  It was fun...I didn't think I was going to like it initially, but they were funny...lol now every time I hear sports commentary I think sexual things...lol.

<u>SATURDAY</u>
Becky & I had some nasty ass waffles...but the tater tots were good.  We waited till Chad came & then we went to the mall...I got my hair cut really cute & then I bought Will's anniversary present (heehee) & got a Victoria's Secret lil pink doggie...it's cute! Then we came back & wasted time...I called Will b.c I was missing him since Becky had Chad here...but no, he was too busy talking to Mike & whoever else was there, & his ""battery was dying"" again so I called & used minutes for nothing.  So then I felt like I was going to be depressed the rest of the day, but I think Becky & Chad made an effort to make me feel like I was included...lol they got drunk before we went to this skating thing at Munn Ice Arena, it was funny.  When we got there, the line for skates was wrapped halfway around the ice rink.  So I had to wait for an hour or so for skates...& the realized that hey, my knee is a piece of shit & I cant skate for long...we walked all the way back across campus after that & ordered a pizza on the way...then went to bed @ 3.

<u>SUNDAY</u>
Woke up at 12 to Will calling me to say hi...& then preceding to not listen to me & then saying he had to leave b.c him & Mike were going out or whatever.  I had a biscuit with honey (yum) & some of the potatoes like I ate in Australia for my meal...Now I'm just sitting here thinking about going to Meijer's b.c I need a coupe things...then I'm going to the library to get books for my dumbass research paper that my teacher refuses to help me with...ah well.

I'm really not sure that I want to be here anymore...but I don't know where I want to go.  I hate the fact that I can't decide what I want to do...it bothers me that I have no direction or anything.  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!

peace out."

"event","I worked the INSANE lunch shift today (12-4).&nbsp; Normally, we all have a section of 4-6 tables, and we just take the tables in our little sections and hope the hostesses seat people in our sections.&nbsp; Nooooo, the lunch rush is different.&nbsp; The entire restaurant is almost filled, there are only 3 servers, and we take TOTALLY random tables all over the restaurant.&nbsp; The rule of thumb is this: If you see them get seated, you HAVE to be their server, no matter how many tables you are already attending or where they are, you have to help that table.<br /><br />And Josh gets the food up so fast during lunch!&nbsp; By the time I got my drinks and salads out, the food was ready, so trying to coordinate the varying needs of all the tables (drinks, refills, seating, salads, rolls, adding checks, pre-bussing) and still grab my food the second it comes up (which, according to my boss/cook, Josh, is THE most important thing, and he will SCREAM at you if you're not fast enough)... it is pretty hectic.<br /><br />I do it again tomorrow.<br /><br />But after work I went and saw my sister, and we took the kids to the park and went and saw Sheldon at work.&nbsp; He let us see the insides of two of his unfinished houses (Beautiful!), and Talia and Rocky picked out their bedrooms, and Mere and Sheldon chatted about what their house is going to look like when they build it.&nbsp; They have huge dreams.&nbsp; It's so cool to listen to them talk, because they are maritally and financially struggling, but they still talk about their future together, because they both know everything is going to work out.&nbsp; They're going to make it work, because they love each other.<br /><br />Matt came over, and I was so happy to see him.&nbsp; I had really been wanting to talk to him... <br /><br />Meredith and I made dinner (hamburger helper, lol, and I DIDN'T set it on fire!! HOORAY!!), we ate, Meredith and Sheldon went to bed, and so Matt and I sat in his truck for a long time and... talked.&nbsp; ""Talked.""<br /><br />It was a pretty mild day, altogether.&nbsp; The work rush was short, I loved seeing my sis, and I got to get some stuff off of my chest with Matt.&nbsp; Talked to him about the way I was feeling, and he seemed relieved.&nbsp; I think he thought I had like 500 boyfriends, because I talk about a lot of guys, because almost all my friends are guys.&nbsp; It was a very very short explanation, but we understand each other a little better.<br /><br />At the end of the night, I made him/tried to make him promise not to talk about my physical features.&nbsp; I'm having a rough time with that right now.&nbsp; All those memories and feelings that I had when I lived with Jim and Wendy - how they all told me I was ugly, unattractive, worthless, all the time - Those are bothering me.&nbsp; And I have always been intimidated by my BEAUTIFUL sister, and even though I love her, and I'm glad we are close again, I can't help comparing myself to her and feeling... ugly.&nbsp; And chunky.&nbsp; It's a girl thing.&nbsp; We compare ourselves to other girls.<br /><br />But anyway, those two things combined are causing me some insecurity.&nbsp; I'll get over it eventually...<br />.....<br /><em>And if you will,<br />I will try to let it go.<br />And if you'll try, I'll try.<br />Try to let it show us the way.<br />Because love is here to stay.<br />Just look me in the eye.<br />This is do or die.<br />And I will stay in love until you say 'enough'.<br />There is no giving in.<br />There is no giving up in love.</em><br /><br />Jewel - Again and Again<br />"

"event","Two weeks ago, in Beux's dorm, I weighed 103 pounds.&nbsp; Today, I weigh 89 pounds.<br /><br />So, yes... I am very stressed.<br /><br />And what is the cause of all this stress?&nbsp; You got it: The move.&nbsp; The lyrics come to mind ""Girl, I really need to know, do I stay or do I go?""<br /><br />See... I've been thinking a LOT lately.&nbsp; I mean, a LOT.&nbsp; And I'm worried that my stubbornness and disappointment are driving me back home to Orem just because I feel like a failure.&nbsp; I'm afraid I might not me making the right decision.&nbsp; Maybe... Maybe I am supposed to learn something here is Vernal?&nbsp; Why else would I end up here?<br /><br />After a ton of thought, I decided that Salt Lake maybe isn't the best place for me.&nbsp; I think I would have a TON of fun, but I'd have access to WAY too much trouble.. and since I am a trouble-maker-with-bad-luck anyway... well... maybe SLC is not my best option.&nbsp; It would take me further down a path I'll just end up turning around on anyway - I want to straighten out my life and be a good wife and have a family.&nbsp; Maybe partying all the time is not going to get me closer to that goal.<br /><br />My old friend, Doug, got engaged.&nbsp; I told my dad, and he scolded me.&nbsp; He said that Doug was another ""good one"" that I could have had, but I let him slip away.&nbsp; Well, yeah, that's true, a little bit.&nbsp; I waited for Doug and wrote him on his mission, and we shared some very close secrets and an amazing bond.&nbsp; But it didn't work out, and I regret it a tiny bit, now that he's ""tied down"".&nbsp; <strong>Well... it's not actually a regret that I'm not with Doug.&nbsp; It's a regret that I'm not worthy of the life that Doug is going to have - </strong>sealed in the temple for eternity, with god's blessing, close to his family, with a loving, totally comitted spouse... I won't have that reassurance.&nbsp; And Doug's engagement kinda drove that in, and it was a pretty sharp little pang.<br /><br />Dumb, I know.&nbsp; Mom and Dad really want the best for me.&nbsp; They thinkit's time for me to settle down.&nbsp; Technically, I AM twenty-one.&nbsp; In Mormon-world, I am getting <u><strong>old</strong></u>.&nbsp; My biological clock is ticking... I should at<em> <u>least </u></em>be dating or engaged by now... <strong>And instead, I'm a single sinner.&nbsp; This does not bode well.<br /><br /></strong>I got COMPLETELY off the subject there... Okay... so the move is stresing me.&nbsp; JUST LIKE LAST TIME, suddenly this two-day trip had become really really important to me.&nbsp; This trip is going to determine whether I move or stay in Vernal.<br /><br />I'm going to follow my gut instinct.&nbsp; If Orem feels right, I'm going to continue with my plan and just MOVE.&nbsp; But if it feels neutral... then I need to rethink my situation and try to figure out why the hell I'm supposed to be in Vernal.<br /><br />I HATE Vernal.&nbsp; I just can't overlook the possibility that this is where I am supposed to be.&nbsp; All&nbsp; can do is HOPE that I'll ""sense"" that Orem is right... lol.<br /><br />I'm trying to open my eyes to ALL the options I have, instead of just being stubborn about ONE option.&nbsp; This requires a lot of <strong>thought and soul-searching and stress.<br /></strong><br />So I'm losing weight.<br /><br />And yes... I'll admit that a major concern is that there are more people in Vernal that NEED me than there are in Orem or Salt Lake.&nbsp; There are people here that need to be <strong>protected, taken care of, and loved</strong>.&nbsp; Like my sister, my niece and nephew, my family, Matt, Nate, Cass... the list goes on... Why do I feel this need to nurture all the time?&nbsp; WHY?<br /><br />Too much thought going on.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; My car desperately needs an oil change, and that tail light has gotten a warrant out for my arrest...<br /><br />Oh - and I hit $50 at work, even though it was slower than dirt.&nbsp; Ha.<br />.....<br /><br /><em>""The poverty we must fight is the poverty of unwanted humanity, a spiritual poverty that develops when no one cares... It can only be cured by love.""</em><br /><br />- Mother Theresa"

"event","I've had a lot to think about today.  I learned a lot about myself and my life, and I'm trying to gather all my thoughts, even if it is 1:02 am and I just got home.  I need to organize my thoughts before I'll be able to sleep.<br /><br />I decided to clean out my car, because it was almost overflowing with junk.  In the process of doing this, I opened my trunk, and it was still filled with boxes I had never even unpacked when I'd moved, because I just assumed I'd be moving back in four weeks anyway.  There was a ton of trash in there too, from before the wreck.  My room looks the same way.  You can't even walk in there, because it is just piled high with boxes everywhere.  Some things are half-opened to get to things I needed, and stuff is strewn across what floor space there is.  Someone once told me that the state of your bedroom is a symbol of the state of your life... and so is your car.  Well, I have ket my car and my room in a state of perpetual chaos.  That was really eye-opening to see the mess I've created for myself in my stubbornness against 'adjusting' to Vernal.<br /><br />So I cleaned out my car, and I'll vacuum tomorrow.  I was promising Jake all day long to go see him, but all kinds of stuff kept coming up.  Finally, I ended up going to work, but when I got there, the entire restaurant was closed down.  Apparently, the owner's wife has been a complete bitch to all the employees for a long long time, and today she started screaming at a waitress n the middle of the lunch rush, and the waittress walked out.  Well, then the boss/cook walked out and told everyone else to walk out, too.  So Stockman's went on strike.  There is a moutain of dishes still in there, the ovens and burners are all still on, the food is all sitting out, going to waste.  The whole kitchen is just sitting there... And they had to go out and tell all the loyal lunch-rush customers that they had to leave because the cooks left.  How unprofessional...<br /><br />Well, I was going to go party with the crew, but my sister called and asked me to help her, so I went shopping with her and the kids.  Sheldon was in a better mood tonight, so he and Matt came and started watching Indiana Jones with me and Meredith... but fifteen minutes into the movie, Sheldon was asleep on Meredith, and Matt was asleep on me, so Meredith and I went outside for a smoke and talked until Matt woke up and came and found us.  Then my sister went to bed, and Matt and I sat out and talked for a few more minutes.<br /><br />All day long, I've been thinking about my stubbornness.  It's obvious, even to me, that I won't be moving out to Salt Lake on the 16th.  Realistically, it will be much longer than that... And that breaks my heart.  I have been counting days until I could move again, and now I have to face the fact that I won't be going anywhere anytime soon... So all day long today, these thoughts have been pouring through my head - 'What do I do now?' 'Why is this happening?' 'What's my best option?'  And I had been talking to Matt yesterday, and I said something offhand that just kept coming back to me over and over, so now I'm trying to work it out in my head and make sure it's as right as it feels.<br /><br />My aunt, who is my favorite relative, by far (and who Meredith says I am just like, lol), called me on the phone a few days ago and talked to me for a long time about how bad things happen in life sometimes, and sometimes people scam you, and you have to learn from your mistakes and not become bitter.  I love my Aunt Debbie, and she has been through so much that I have already been through, so it was a really great talk, and very very soothing to me.  Well, a few days after she talked with me, she sent my parents a massive check to get me out of debt and get my on my way back to school... I didn't know what to do or how to thank her.  It was so amazing.  Like getting another chance!  And I am going to make her proud.<br /><br />Here in Vernal, there is an applied technology college with tons of scholarship money.  Literally anyone who applies can have their whole career education completely paid for.  I'm living with my parents, so I don't have to pay rent, and I only work at nights.  Why shouldn't I go back to school until I get enough money saved up?  That would give me something to focus on, maybe I'd make some friends, and I'd be making real, significant progress that other people could be proud of me for.  And I could be proud of myself and maybe not feel like I'm such a failure.  We have the USU extension here, too.  I could take classes there.  Why not?  And why haven't I realized all this before?  My mom's been telling me this for weeks, but I've been avoiding the subject, because I was so determined to move immediately.<br /><br />The nights are chilly now.  We're entering Autumn - my favorite season.  But there's something else going on.  I can feel changes happening in me.  I know the time is right to MAKE something out of myself and really progress.  I'd been slowly moving forward and becoming better while in Orem, and I thought Vernal was a speedbump.  Well, it's not.  It's part of the journey.  Here I am.  A new season is starting in my life, and I am going to embrace it.  I'm growing close to my sister and already forming a dear friendship with Matt.  I have some other friends scattered around this town, too.  Maybe there's no reason to feel so lonely.  I'm getting ready for Autumn, and this Autumn is going to be beautiful.<br />.....<br /><em>There is something in the autumn that is native to my blood-<br />Touch of manner, hint of mood;<br />And my heart is like a rhyme,<br />With the yellow and the purple and the crimsom keeping time.<br />There is something in October sets the gypsy blood astir;<br />We must rise and follow here,<br />When from every hill of flame<br />She calls and calls each vagabond by name.</em><br /><br />Bliss Carlman - ""A Vagabond Song"""

<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal"">Jake says he sprained his ankle stepping off of a ladder, but it looks broken to me.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It's so swollen - one side of it has a lump the size of like two eggs - it looks terrible, but he didn't go to the doctor.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>He ordered pizza, and we watched ""That 70's Show"" and drank.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>He pretended no to be in pain, but I am really worried about him.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I'll go see him tomorrow, and if the swelling isn't better...

<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal"">Well, Meredith called me back over (to set me up wth Matt, lol, of course), but when I got there, Meredith and Sheldon were in an awful row.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>After a few minutes, Matt pulled up, so I went and hugged him and climbed up into his truck so we could let Meredith and Sheldon work it out alone.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was a while before we went to go get drinks from the grocery store, and by the time we got back, we were chatting away (about our plan to go hunt bears and make a big ol' rug for a fireplace, ha ha ha), and Meredith came out and told us that Sheldon was too tired for company.</p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal"">That was fine.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Sheldon works hard, he has been stressed, and he hasn't been able to smoke anything for several days becuase of a pending drug test, and he had previously smoked several times a day every day for years andyears... so the withdrawals are hard on him.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>So Matt and I sat on the trunk of my car and watched the clouds going over the bright white moon, and we talked until 1:00 in the morning, and now I am home.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It ended up being a very relaxing evening.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There's something beautiful about a good conversation outside on a chilly evening, when there's nothing to prove and no one to impress.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Something very honest.</p>

"event","God... I love those lyrics.  I think ""Stairway to Heaven"" is a<strong> masterpiece</strong>.  I got home from work (12:45 - it was an early night), and sat down and started trying to unravel some of the weirdest parts of my twisted mind...<br /><br />And somehow, for some unknown reason, I started reading the lyrics to ""Stairway to Heaven"", and I just <strong>broke down and cried </strong>and cried and cried.  It feels like the write for Led Zeppelin peered into the future and saw me and wrote the song just to soothe me... and when I looked up a little bit about the song... it looks like millions of people have felt the same way I feel right now about this one piece of indescribable writing.<br /><br /><em>And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune<br />Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br />And a new day will dawn for those who stand long<br />And the forests will echo with laughter. </em><br /><br />Have you ever heard anything that offers more sympathy and hope??  EVER??<br /><br />I have gotten some e-mails from a friend who wants me to figure out my brain, throw off my load of bullshit, get my act together, and start a relationship.  Do I love this person?<u><strong>  Yes.</strong></u>  Do I want to try a relationship?  Of course.  So why the hell do I feel so absolutely terrified every time I even think about it.  Every time the thoguht crosses my mind, my heart starts pounding, and I start hyperventilating.  <strong>WHY??</strong>  How can I be so messed up and confused?<br /><br />Bad things have happened to me in the past... horrible relationships and even worse break-ups, people messing with my head and abusing my body and destroying my privacy... people who hurt me or lied to me, or made me cut, or proposed marriage and abandoned me.  Rape, attempted rape, peeping toms, people who told me every day that I was ugly and worthless... people who took every moment to degrade me and drag me down...<br /><br />And now, I hvae this chance, this hope, this opportunity... and I am too frightened to just DO it.  WHY??<br /><br />I was thinking... I know, since I started cutting... I have been dependent.  I<strong> have based my identity off of whomever I was dating at the time</strong>, and I was never without a boyfriend.  I relied on my boyfriend, not just to be my ""other half"" but to be ME - at least, to tell me what I was.  And today, I know nothing about myself.  I have <u><strong>NO IDEA who I am</strong></u> (and living in Vernal is making it so much worse...)<br /><br />The last time I cut deeply, it was a suicide attempt.  A boy I really loved dumped me flat on my ass, and I was DONE.  I QUIT.  I remember waking up in a pool of blood, blood sprayed and smeared everywhere... and having a sudden sense of the damage I had done... and how low I really was.  <strong>It was like waking up from a long, long nightmare</strong>...  There's no other way to describe it.  A little bit like being reborn...<br /><br />And I thought to myself... <strong>""How did I get here?"" ""What kind of person am I?"" ... but I had no answer. </strong><br /><br />I don't want to go there again.  I don't know who the hell I am yet, but I am terrified to rely on anyone, and I have put up all these horrible, thick, steel walls around myself now.  I feel like I can't trust anyone, I can't be ""with"" anyone - I have to do it all myself.  I have to do everything by myself.<br /><br />But shutting people out and <strong>denying</strong> myself happiness... How can that be the answer?  <strong>THere's no way</strong> that's the answer.<br /><br />I want to be firm.  That's what I <strong>truly, deeply desire</strong> in every way.  I want to know who I am and ALWAYS ALWAYS be able to have that knowledge and base my decisions off of my OWN JUDGEMENT and my OWN personality.  <strong>I'm so tired of this flip-flopping.</strong>.. I don't want to not be able to give an answer to any question.  I want to be mentally STABLE.  I don't want to cut, or rely on other people to take care of me.  <br /><strong><br />I want to know what I want.  </strong>And I want to have the firmness to get what I want.<br /><br /><em>Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br />There's still time to change the road you're on. </em><br /><br /><u><strong>But I don't know how.</strong></u><br /><strong><em><br />To be a rock and not to roll.</em></strong>  That's what I want.  That's all.<br /><br />.....<br /><em>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br />And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br />In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br />And the voices of those who stand looking. </em><br /><br />Stairway To Heaven, Led Zeppelin"

"event","God... it feels like work is never going to end.  I get home at 1 or 1:30 in the morning, sleep LATE, and then I barely have time to get anything done before I am at work again.<br /><br />Tonight was Friday, and I was in extras, which means I went up and down the stairs about one million times.  We close an hour later on weekends, so I was just about to kill over.  PLus, it was my night to do the mopping.  Thank God I've made some friends there, or else it would have really been hell.  Caleb and Wes are really great about cheering me up and keeping me going (they like to talk about 'doing' one another... it's a little dirty, lol), and I had a few pretty nice tables.<br /><br />I'm so glad everyone has been patient with me.  My largest table has been a four-top.  If I tried to take 8 or 10 at a time, plus all my other tables (like all the other servers) there would be a disaster.  Really.<br /><br />And I'm still sick.  It's been months, and it is kicking my ass.  I'm really sick of being sick.  I swear, if this doesn't get better soon, I'm going BACK to the doctor, and I'm gonna have some ""investigative surgery"" done, because this is ridiculous, and I get sooooo tired at night.  Especially since my damn medication shuts my body off at about 9:00.  And when I still have 4 more hours of work ahead of me... it's exhausting.<br /><br />We had a staff meeting tonight, and Amber said that the next person to talk shit about someone else is going to get a write-up, and then get fired.  I guess that was a good thing, because the crew was way better, but I don't want anyone to get written up over something as small as that.  Yesterday, I just got my feelings hurt really bad...<br /><br />Next week, I close every night except Wednesday night.  I'm stressing on that, but maybe it will mean more moeny... even though I am making way less than anyone else.  I know part of it is because I have such small tables, but I really just want to be making money so I can get out of this ""village"".  And I know it's because I suck, and I am always forgetting things.<br /><br />Maybe I will go to the doctor next week... because with the way my body feels right now... getting a second job is out of the question.<br /><br />Meh.  There's something to be said for getting married young, that's for sure... **groan**<br /><br />.....<br /><em>Tomorrow we'll get up;<br />drive to work single file;<br />with every day just like the last.<br />Waiting for life to start.<br />Is it always... just always ahead of the curve?<br />Save our ship!<br />The anchor is part of the desk.<br />We can't cut free!<br />The water is flooding the decks!<br /></em><br />Thursday - ""For The Workforce, Drowning"""

"event","<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Today was another long and eventful day here in the tiny town of Vernal.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>By some weird set of circumstances, my best friend, soul mate, and very dear ninja, Brian (aka: Muffin) was in town, and he called me around noon.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>We decided that it would be absolutely imperative for us to hang out today, so I hopped in the shower to get ready to go see him.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>That's when Cassidy called, and he had really bad news... His dad had been life-flighted to Salt Lake City because of a major heart attack - This is the third one he has had.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Today, he went in for a triple bypass surgery, which is a really long and stressful procedure.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Cassidy is so strong and good-hearted, that he was still being really calm and cheerful, but I could tell he was stressed, so I told him we'd all go do something together.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, when hard thngs happen, all you can do is wait.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But you should never EVER be left alone during the really hard times, and Cass needed his friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">So I went to get Brian, and there he was like an angel, seated under a tree and dressed completely in white, reading a book.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I took some quality time to get cradled in his lap and THAT was the most relaxing time I have had in soooo long.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I love Brian.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>He's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It is such a healing experience to be close to the someone you love so much - and who loves you in return - I felt like a whole Being again.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was nice to sit under that tree like we were kids again, and just chat and enjoy each other's company...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">We went and picked up Cass, and he let me see his amazing guitars.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One is this gorgeous, classic white bass - this thing is like a vintage 1969 guitar - and then he has this black warlock guitar with these awesome spikey-things... It's like Heaven and Hell, lol.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>And an aquamarine bass that was really awesome, too.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Cassidy got everyone drinks and ice cream, and we met Dee and Dawn Rae and headed up to the lake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">The lake was really fun.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Brian returned my earlier ""favor"" and let me watch him change into his swimsuit... lol... (We have an odd relationship, and yes, I am just kidding...) and Dawn Rae challenged all to swim this HUGE distance out to the buoy.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Well, Cass, Dee, Dawn Rae, and I all made it, but I only got back to the shore by spluttering and half-drowning.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>(Brian had to come out and save me.) <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>My legs are so sore now.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Then we took some more pictures.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Cass seemed pretty bummed out, even though he was trying so hard not to show it.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>We were all really worried about him, but we were trying to decide to let him be alone with his thoughts or try to cheer him up... I ended up cheering him up a little by taking photos where I am climbing on top of him... or shall I say... ""mounting"" him.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It reminded me so much of when we were all young, and Cass, Brian, Corey, and I would all just hang out in Amy's backyard or Corey's basement and be absolute little perverts and tease each other and make ""insinuating"" comments and actions.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was all in fun, and it was because we were so close, and we all understood each other on such a personal level... LOL... I remember when they dubbed me the ""Alpha Male"" of the group.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I REALLY MISS BEING ""ONE OF THE GUYS""!!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I miss that so much...&nbsp; (Work is really great, because I fit in there as ""one of the guys"" - in a less extreme way... there's a lot of butt-slapping and mock-humping and other weird stuff that goes on.&nbsp; Short version: The crew is WILD.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Well, we headed home, and I had about two minutes to get ready to go to work.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I followed Doug around all night long, learning how to wait on tables and what my duties will be.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It's not too bad until the restaurant closes... then it's insane!!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>We took two-and-a-half hours to get out of there, after we closed, working our BUTTS OFF.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was hard work, and I am so tired now.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Between all the swimming and the running around on the restaurant floor, and the closing work... I am just tired.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I can't believe Cass came into work today, after everything he has gone through.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I'm so glad he did though.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want him to be alone, and I really hope I can spend some time with him tomorrow.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>More than anything, I hope his dad is okay...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Brian just came to my window, and it was really bizarre.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was just like being in Junior High School again, when Bri used to sneak to my window in the middle of the night, and we'd whisper back and forth until I heard my dad wake up upstairs, and then Brian would have to run away as fast as he could... It was kind of bittersweet.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It reminded me of how deeply and how long I have loved Brian... how much we have gone through since those days of our youth.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But it was hard, because it felt like being in prison.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Even at 21 years old, I am still trapped within the confines of my parent's house...<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Well, I am going to have an extra day off this weekend, so maybe I will go visit Brian during my trip home.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I hope so...</span></p>

"event","<em>""It is a far, far better thing to have a firm anchor in nonsense than to put out on the troubled seas of thought.""</em><br />J.K. Galbraith, The Affluent Society<br /><br />Mormons believe that Sunday should be a day of rest.  So today, I rested.  My sister and I went to church with my family, then we went to Meredith's house.  We had her two kids, Talia (3) and Rocky (1) - and those two are little hellions!!  I love them!  We goofed off all day long - it was so nice to see my sister... and it was SUCH a relief to be in a miniskirt again!!  I miss my minis so bad!!<br /><br />Well, Sheldon, and his friend, Matt, came home (they were hill-climbing at the sand dunes with a dune buggy and Sheldon's truck), and Meredith and Sheldon were sooo obviously trying to hook up me and Matt, that we were forced to oblige, and we went to go get movies.  Matt's a quiet guy with these downcast, shy blue eyes.  It was really fascinating to see a grown man be so demure.  We rented ""Tommy Boy"" and went back to Meredith and Sheldon's, and we watched the movie together. (They kept making excuses to leave me and Matt ""alone"" together.  It was pretty funny.  Meredith thinks if she hooks me up, I'll stay in Vernal...)<br /><br />I have to say this... These people smoke a LOT. lol.  How can I keep up??  So, Matt took me home, and we talked about ahnging out sometime, and... it really made me miss Beux.<br /><br />I'm naturally a really rowdy person, and I am always fighting to keep myself quiet, but sometimes I just crack jokes and stupid puns, or I tease, and I can't help it!  One of the great things about Beux is that he gets my jokes, and he laughs with me.  He's so relaxed and fun!&nbsp; He doesn't seem to care if I make an idiot out of myself, and he has enough confidence to not always be second-guessing himself, too.&nbsp; I know Matt is really shy and reserved, and that makes it harder for him to be goofy, but... I don't think he understood any of my jokes.  It was hard to make him smile.  A lot like Chris, except not so intense - Matt was really chill.<br /><br />Not to say I didn't like him.  He is GREAT with kids.  I mean... he is the best guy I have ever seen interact with kids, and that's so important to me.  Weid to say, considering the fact that about two months ago, the mere sight of children could send me into a full-blown panic attack... I don't know what happened that changed my mind and my heart with that, but man... It's times like these that I feel like I am sooo ready to have my own family... **sigh**<br /><br />And I want to talk to Beux... I hate being so far away.<br /><br />So... Last night I had this crazy dream, and I have to record it, because it was so odd, and there were so many people in it... It just proves how homesick I am!!<br /><br />So there's this prom, and I'm supposed to go with Chris, but he disappears somewhere.  Well, Beux decides to be my date, but he is (for some reason) smoking a big fat roach, so I tell him not to worry about it, and he goes and eat Cheetos with Kelsi (from Convergys).  Then, I see Cynthia, and she and I go out to this dry riverbed and start taking pictures, but then the riverbed starts slowly filling with water, so we follow the flow of the water to this open place on a lake that's covered with all these rickety bridges and docks, going this way nd that way, and most of them are falling apart or tilted.<br /><br />We have to be careful, because the water is filled with sharks, and there is a heavy gray fog everywhere, so you can only kinda see sillhouettes, but I start taking these really cool pictures of Cynthia, (and Mike is there, and he is carrying a pet monkey around all over the docks) and then Cynthia's dad comes and says he wants to talk to me.  So Jean-Louis and I go sit on a dock in the mist, and we're smoking, and I'm eating tortilla chips, and he is telling me not to give up hope on his son, and how Chris is going to come around and take me to the dance, and I suddenly get REALLY depressed,  I want SO BAD to tell him that I am too tired and hurt, and I want to just give up, but my mouth is FULL of tortilla chips!!  They're like a gag, because no matter how hard I try to swallow them, I can't swallow!  So I can't talk.<br /><br />Then, I'm at the prom with this other guy, who is talking about 'Legos'.  I see Adrienne there, and she is in this gorgeous white dress, and she tells me that I need to go get Beux under control.  Well, this prom is being held in a mall, and in the mall, I spot Beux, and he's still stoned, so I run over and try to calm him down, because he's acting all crazy, and I'm laughing, and it's weird... and then I finally get him calmed down, and we cuddle for a while, and he falls asleep on a couch in this mall.  Well, then Chris shows up, and he says he's sorry he got disracted, and Chris and I go and dance, but then we decide to go make out behind a couch, and we do, but then his mom starts yelling at us from a balcony that everyone can see us, and she is laughing really hard.  So Chris and I start laughing, and then he has to go to work in one of the upstairs stores in the mall... and then I wake up...<br /><br />Weird, huh?  Kimmie was in the dream too, but I don't remember where...<br /><br />.....<br /><em>""Sometimes I ain't so sho who's got ere a right to say when a man is crazy and when he ain't.  Sometimes I think it ain't none of us pure crazy and ain't none of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him that-a-way.  It's like it ain't so much what a fellow does, but it's the way the majority of folks is looking at him when he does it... ...But I ain't so sho that ere a man has the right to say what is crazy and what ain't.  It's like there was a fellow in every man that done a-past the sanity or the insanity, that watches the sane and the insane doings with the same horror and the the same astonishment.""</em><br /><br />William Faulkner, ""As I Lay Dying"""

"event","<em>Don't wait. <br />Don't wait. <br />The lights will flash and fade away. <br />The days will pass you by. <br />Don't wait to lay your armor down...</em> <br /><br />A little self-doubt and regret today... <br /><br />What is there, lurking deep in human nature, that has the capacity to inflict such a wound on a loyal friend? Have I not been his friend? Wasn't I supportive? <br /><br />And when he chose to go another path, did I not stand beside him and encourage him, even when my own heart was breaking? Didn't I jump at his call and run to the rescue as often as he'd let me? How long did I wait for him? <br /><br />And now... in the hour of my need, he turns from me. He lets me fend for myself. Where is the instinct to protect the women who love you? <br /><br />What monster dwells in the human soul? What beast is there, that it can swallow love like a piece of candy... and regurgitate it whenever it pleases? <br /><br />And how can a dear friend injure me so badly? How could he have the GUTS to treat me the way he has? After what he has put me through and the love I have given him? <br /><br />All I wanted was to say goodbye. I said I expected nothing of him. Just goodbye.<br /><br />... Today I hung out with my sister and her kids. Sheldon was bow-hunting for deer (he got a buck today), so we had the house to ourselves. It was really fun... and strange to see how similar our lives have actually been. We haven't spent much time together in years, and today was really a healing experience for us. We became sisters again. <br /><br />And she is trying to hook me up with her and Sheldon's friend, Matt... Yeah... That's my sister...<br /><br />..... <br /><em>If thro' the sea of night which <br />here surrounds me, <br />I could swim out beyond the <br />farthest star, <br />Break every barrier of circumstance <br />that bounds me, <br />and greet the Sun of sweeter <br />life afar, <br /><br />Tho' near you there is passion, <br />grief, and sorrow, <br />And out there rest and joy and <br />peace and all, <br />I should renounce that beckoning <br />for to-morrow, <br /><strong>I could not choose to go beyond <br />your call.</strong> <br /></em><br />""Anchored"" - Paul Laurence Dunbar <br />"

"event","Stockman's is a restaurant within a hotel, and the food is heavenly. It's dining for the GODS, and that's the truth. It's really casual - the servers even wear jeans - so I like it quite a bit so far (I recommend the chicken penne... delicious...). <br /><br />My crew is awesome. All I did tonight was learn some of the kitchen and learn how to make salads, prepare potatoes, etc. The cooks were so nice to me! Nick took me under his wing, and John was a little gruff at first, but ended up calling me ""Darlin'"" every time he talked to me. Jeremy and the others were nice, too, and all the waittresses were really sweet. There's a very healthy, if not rigorous, amount of name-calling and butt-slapping going on, too... so I guess I fit in pretty well. Ha Ha Ha. I'm kidding. <br /><br />On Monday and Tuesday, I get to train as a waittress, then I'll waittress Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday... so Saturday and Sunday I will be able to come home. I'LL SEE YOU IN ONE WEEK, SATAN!!!<br /><br />I started preparing my ""Book of Bohemian Knowledge"" today, lol. I have all kinds of odd interests that I am going to study and learn more about: palmistry, auras, buddhism, tantra, reflexology, energy work, chromotherapy, etc etc etc. There is so much alternative knowledge to gain in the world, and I figure if I focus on the things that make me really unique from my family... maybe I won't lose my mind.<br /><br />I hope they don't take it as open rebellion. I am still being respectful. And I'll go to church. I just NEED things that are mine, that are different - things that make me feel like, in some small way, I can be myself.<br /><br />Man, I feel so useless. I feel like there is this huge purpose that I'm just not fulfilling. I think it's going to be necessary for me to move back sooner than expected. I can already feel myself brinking on the edge of a major breakdown...

"event","Man... Depression is settling in now. It feels like every cell in my body has doubled its weight. The realization of this task is suddenly in front of me, and it seems like too much to bear.<br /><br />I love my family. They are wonderful people with tons of affection. But my siblings - and especially our family dog - seem to have no sense of privacy. There are no moments that someone isn't talking to me, or asking questions, or asserting needs. I'm so amazed by my mom. How does she not feel utterly overwhelmed by these constant demands?<br /><br />I need time to breathe, to calm down, to confront and accept my fate. Everything happened so fast! It was like: ""Go! Go! Go!"" and suddenly I'm in Vernal, and I'm so tired and miserable that I can't keep up. And with 4 boys, a dog, a parakeet, video games, tv, and music everywhere, there is no quiet place anywhere. Life has created a continual, pounding migraine.<br /><br />Three days ago, I was completely free. The house was quiet, I could do whatever I wanted, come and go as I pleased, use my phone, watch whatever I wanted, drink whatever I wanted, use my computer, wear the cothes I like, see my friends, sit around and read, or go play with someone... I had time to think and be myself. Now I am walking on ice EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY, and everything about my life has completely flipped around so that I have zero independence, and I have to report everything I do...<br /><br />I'm a free spirit. I have my own standards of right and wrong, and my own methods of doing things. I know they're not the same as my family or my religion, but I believe that everyone has to find their own place. I do what I am comfortable with doing, and I let my conscience and my instinct guide me.<br /><br />It feels like I am being smothered to death right now - watching what I say, what I wear, what I eat - It's frustrating. I think, right now, as soon as I get home, I'm going to be tattoed, pierced, and drunk close to death, just to assert my identity again.<br /><br />Today, my old friend, Cassidy, took me to Stockman's and introduced me to the head waittress. Because of Cass' recommendation, I got the job there, and I start tomorrow. I'm excited to work with the crew, and I really hope having a job will help me feel some kind of sense of accomplishment. Maybe I can come home sooner. At least, it will get me out of the house. Cassidy is so great!<br /><br />I don't want to be ungrateful to my family. They are amazing, and they've welcomed me back with open arms. And no, they've never made an open demands... it's the ""silent expectation"" that's killing me. They know I know what they want me to be, and they expect me to be respectful and be that person under their roof. It's just... I am too used to being alone and being my own person. <strong>I can't function in a unit again. I don't fit in here.</strong> I feel like the funky puzzle piece, and I am soooo, so depressed and discouraged. I miss Beux. He must think it's bizarre that I'm so attached to him, but I admire him beyond words. He's completely unafraid of being himself. I miss Chris and Adrienne and Cynthia. <br /><br />I miss myself.<br /><br />.....<br /><em>After the teacher asked if anyone had <br />a sacred place<br />and the students fidgeted and shrank<br />in their chairs, the most serious of them all<br />said it was his car,<br />being in it alone, his tape deck playing<br />things he'd chosen, and others knew the truth<br />had been spoken<br />and began speaking about their rooms,<br />their hiding places, but the car kept coming up,<br />the car in motion,<br />music filling it, and sometimes one other person<br />who understood the bright alter of the dashboard<br />and how far away<br />a car could take him from the need<br />to speak, or to answer, the key<br />in having a key,<br />and putting it in, and going.<br /><br />-""The Sacred"" - Stephen Dunn</em>"

"event","Wednesday<br /><br />I'm a little shell-shocked, but at least I stopped crying for a little while.  Everything feels like a dream, even though I slept for most of the day and read an entire book: ""The Red badge of Courage.""  It's only 100 pages, I know, but it was enough to keep me occupied in this surreal world...<br /><br />I unloaded a few boxes, but it made everything seem too close to reality.  I kept wanting to wake up.  The house is so loud.  There is always commotion.  I wish I was home, alone, or with a friend.<br /><br />.....<br /><em>""The youth perceived that the time had come.  He was about to be measured.  For a moment he felt in the face of his trial like a babe, and the flesh over his heart seemed very thin.  He seized time to look about him calculatingly.""<br />- Stephen Crane, ""The Red Badge of Courage""</em>"

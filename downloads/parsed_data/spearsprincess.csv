the following day, i used the same stall and i saw a piece of toilet paper in the bowl. i thought nothing of it but i had a subconcious feeling the toilet wasnt working proper but i ignored it and used it anyway. (i was on my period by the way) 

i finished and the thing flush, but instead of water going down, the water was rising, do not panic i told myself, lets try and make it flush again...

the water started overflowing onto the floor and i was like OH MY GODDDDDD!!! i ran out of the bathroom after i washed my hands. thank god no one saw me, how i wouldve been so humilated

"event","melissa and i went to niagara falls on tues and we had lotsa fun buying candy apples and indulging in 4 chocolate covered strawberries from the Hersey store. It was so yum that by the time we got back to our meeting place, the bus had left us and we were stranded for another 2 hrs. going back in the end of june. going to walk over to buffalo and get some planterns.

"event","i get more rejection letters than i do job interviews.

its down to the wire, and we find out either this week or next if work is gonna keep us. and chances are slim cause they dont need that much ppl. i think he might hire at least 2 and ihave as good a chance as the next guy but i have prepared myself to be rejected.

im gonna be disappointed, not b/c i love the job b/c i dont, but i dont mind it, its just that im gonna have to go back to the start after working so hard these 3 months.

i told myself that no matter what happens, im leaving my retail job in july. i have taken my 2 month sick leave ppl have been saying im on vacation. go to hell bastards!"

"event","and johnny. had to change my shift to the 8-4 so i was assuming, i could at least make it at the back of the radio station before 6:30. i get out and long behold the line up was CRAZY. 

i thought, ""what a complete WASTE!!"" but then i remembered they were at much music so i sprinted over there and the crowd was complete mayhem but later, i managed to squeeze my itty bitty self up to 3rd row. i just held on my coldplay cd cover, i didnt think i would get chris to sign it, but he saw me standing all quietly, while these monsters next to me were screaming their heads off and he took it and signed it and went back inside.

took pics, cant wait. he looked pretty hot.

went to wonderland on sunday. i rode the tomb raider ride, which was actually pretty cool. i got lots of bruises though cause the ride is very bumpy"

"event","everyone has just been pissing me off lately (mostly at work) i had to suck everything up. this girl pissing me off giving me all these shitty orders when there are tons of ppl to give it to, and of course i cant be giving attitude since i am in a temp to permanent position. i dont mind getting the orders, just dont give it all to me just because u are too lazy to walk to give it to other ppl. i have never seen a bunch of lazy asses in my life. 

this other temp girl annoys me cause she's such a kiss ass. even my boss, what a pansy. i mean he's nice but when it comes down to it, he wont talk to you face to face with a problem, he will email the problem he has with you and address it to everyone. grow some balls!

p.s shirley thanked me for the gift i gave her. she looked right at me and said thank u. SWEEEEEET! i gave butch a gift and i said it was for the 3 boys and he's like, ""r u sure this isnt for shirley? cause she gets all the gifts."""

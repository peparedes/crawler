"event","i havent written in here in so long. but i figure no one reads this anymore so im going to write in it. josh broke up with me yesterday at like 12 am in the morning. he did it for ""both"" of us. yea i do understand where he was coming from and why he did it. its just... if he really did love me like he said he did than he would have stayed with me. love endures ALL. even the worst of times and seperation. i was going to go to PHS anyways! but not anymore. i feel like he doesnt love me anymore. he said he does but he wont actually say it to me. its awkward. i feel so alone. i wont give up on him, though. i never will. people ask me if im crazy to fall in love at 14. well its not. depends on your belief in love. and your belief influences your mind to make it as what you think... will really happen. we all are brainwashing ourselves. if we say that you cant fall in love this early you wont. but if you believe you can. you might. im not saying that one belief is right and the other is wrong. im just saying whatever we believe defines who and what we are. and for one... i believe i love him. and even if he never loves me back... ill love him for the rest of my life. I love Joshua Keith Mendenhall."

""everything you do! and i know you do it on purpose! like today!"" i was like OK?!?! i havent done anything to you! even the people around us say so! so i decided it was for the best, if i broke up with him. esecially after what happened this past break. so after school i found him and tried to break up with him but he kept saying no no, plz, why? and then he said wed talk later tonight. so he called. and we are still going out. i just cant say no.

"event","last night was kara's birthday party. for her b-day we went to the House Of Torment! ahhh! lol. well it wasnt as scary as i thought it was gonna be. it was funny though. carly kept screaming and half of the time i was guiding her because she wouldnt open her eyes! we went in 2 groups of 6. i was stuck with mel mel, denise, britt, my bro ronnie, and carly. it was fun toward the end. it was waay shorter then i expected. we got to this room with clowns and i was like ""get brittney! she is soooo scared of clowns!"" so they went after her! then we went into this butcher room with chains and meat hangin from the ceiling and the butcher had this real metal pipe. i was the last one out of that room and the butcher threw the pipe and it hit me!!! i know it wsas an accident but it kinda hurt! toward the end we entered a school room and there was this guy in an orge jumpsuit. carly still had her eyes closed so to try and make her look i was like ""carly look at his eyes! they are all white!!!"" she looked but the the guy was all like "" you think im cool? you know that rule where the actors cant touch you? well too bad i dont work here!!"" lmao it was soo funny. but at the very end there was this devil thingy that was really tall and wouldnt let you get to the exit. he would always reach for you so it took a while. but anywayz that was the end of the house. we went back to kara's house and just hung out in the game room for a while, then ate pizza, then just hung in her room. evan invited me into kara's closet and i went with him. lmao. im not tellin what went on! but after that nothing really happened except denise got pushed into the pool and britt, shey, evan, cord, nathan jumped in. we just gave a few messages and went home. i went home with carly, spent the night, woke up early, and went to my 2 hour saturday. im still at school but im gonna go before i piss my pants!"

"event","this is my first entry. im siting in a small hotel room at the comfort suites in san antonio. mel mel and britt are still asleep in the bed. i just set this thing up even though it took me foreveer to figure out how to do the stupid thing. lol. yesterday was fun. we went to fright fest at fiesta texas. we didnt get home till 10, then the hotel pool was closed so we asked them to keep it open for another hour so they did just for us. we ate in the hot tub then jumped in the pool which was <EM>freezing</EM>! then these two guys came and asked us if we wanted somethin to drink and my mom was there and she was like ""no the're under age"" and turns out so were they. they were really ugly and annoying. they wouldnt leave my mom alone. after the pool britt took a shower while melissa did who knows what and i went down to the office in the lobby to get on the internet. this person had their password saved so i got on it and had a little fun. but then melissa and britt came and took both the computer and the laptop which made me kinda mad because i was the one who wanted to get on the internet and they just took it away. so i left back up to the room and slept. im gonna go walk around and wait for the girls to wake up so we can go shopping. l8r."

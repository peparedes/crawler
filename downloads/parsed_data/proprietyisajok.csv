Born on the 7th day of month gives you a tendency to be something of a perfectionist and makes you more individualistic in many ways. 

Your mind is good at deep mental analysis and complicated reasoning. 

You are very psychic and sensitive, and you should usually follow your hunches. 



You may not take orders too well, so you may want to work alone or in a situation where you can be the boss. 

This birthday gives a tendency to be somewhat self-centered and a little stubborn.</td>

"event","cking suicidal thoughts have come back into my mind. Everything is starting to turn back into what it was. I feel like a huge fuck-up in everything. Even though I catch my self laughing for some reason these thoughts still come back. Today my grandma was supposed to come back to the house to get some of her things that she left. but really she came to check on the house, and I took care of it but.. she doesn't know that I live alone. and yeah.. my mom is gonna move back in here next weekend... I know she has the right to and it should be great to actually see her but.. we can barely stand each other for an hour let alone her trying to get back into the routine of controlling my life, of which was going somewhat fine at least better than before she mentioned that she would be coming back. I won't be able to do all the things I really want to do. Things with Daniel haven't really been going too well either. Yeah we get to occasionally spend time together but thats only when he can fit me into his schedual. I never really feel like he tries to see me.. I always have to ask him to come over to see him, and he rarely spends the night anymore. I don't know what happened he still says he loves me, but I don't always feel it when he says things like that to me. We have to always ask for hugs and kisses rather just giving them freely. We always end up argeing whic I feel is my fault cause I think I might be getting a little paranoid. which is the stupidest shit. and the sad thing is that I don't have any real best friends. I have friends that I hangout with at school and thats awesome cause thats basically the only times I ever catch me smiling and laughing. but I never really hangout with anyone. Everyone has grown apart, and it sucks. all this stress and depression makes me sick, and I just want to end it all. god, i hate sounding so fucking Emo. But Damit. Life has yet to fuckign prove to me that it sucks yet again. and i swear this is not the last time. oh no, its not the last time."

go!
I was at the beach
sitting on the sand
when I saw this girl
dark brown eys and a dark olive tan
she was watching the sets
with a surfboard underneath her arm
The first moment I saw her
why didn't she do me some harm?
( so good )
she came out of the water
the best action I'd seen
man, she had the biggest chi-chis
I had ever seen
she put down her board
and sat down next to me
played a soft ad lonely tune
on a yukaleylee(????)

well, I don't know what happened
but I'd fallen asleep
the next morning I woke up 
she was sleeping next to me
***(ahhhhhhhh,I fell in love with her
I'm so in love wih her
I fell in love with her
my little surfer girl)

she got out of bed 
and waxed both our boards
grabbed me byt hte hand 
and took me out the door
we surfed all that day long
atleast an hour straight
man, I knew she was the one 
and damn it I couldn't wait

well, I asked if she loved me
she said( yeah I guess)
so I asked her to marry me
damn it you know she said yes
(***)
I was at the alter
in my tuxedo
waiting for my surfer girl
never did she go
later on that day
a friend of me did tell
that she went to mexico 
to catch a ten foot swell
That Bitch!
(***)
My surfer girl...                 -HOME GROWN (SADLY!!!) sorry guys"

(September 23 - October 22)
As this is the sign that rules marriage, Librans are definitely cut out for it. They're capable of making the associated adjustments, and of sacrificing some of their own desires to accommodate their beloved. They're also very romantic! Librans tend to define themselves by their relationships, and thus they don't feel complete without one."

*is awkward silence
*your eyelids close
*when your around me
*to shut me out
-So I'll go walkin in the streets 
till my heels bleed
and I'll sing out my song
case the birds wish to sing along
and I'll dig a tunnel 
to the center of the universe

beyond the blank horizon

we're yellin through the streets
and I'm out of my fuckin mind

legs to beat the ground 
and our hearts to beat the bend
skys on firework and
run down this sappy way
lightning bolts again
we've become fire flies 
just flashing at the end
battle of these cans
We've got to
be raptures
by all us brooting men
the five we've become
and I know your under me

For the light bulb breaks sometimes
and the tender warmth inside
has released into my life

better turn that thing down
turn it around

It wasn't me said the boy with the gun
sure I pulled the trigger 
but it needed to be done
becasue lifes been killin me ever since it begun
you can't blame me cause I'm too young

you can't blame me shug
the killer was my son
but I didn't teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
its the killin on his Tv screen
you can't blame me its those energies he's seen

Well,you can't blame me says the media man 
well, I wasn't the one who came up with the plan
its not just for my camera what the people want to see
man its a two way mirror and you can't blame me

you can't blame me says the singer of the song
or the maker of the movie which he basedhis life on
its only entertainment and as anyone can see
smoke machines are maker men you can't fool me

it was you it was me it was every man
we've all got the blood on our hands
we'll only see what we demand
and if we want hell then hells what we'll have

and I would turn ont he TV
but its so embarassing
to see all the other people
don't even know what they mean
and it was magic at first
but let everyone down
and this world is gonna hurt
you better turn it around
turn it around.

Well, It started off this morning I slept over at Daniels house I first woke uparound 6:30 am and his alarm clock went off but he didn't wae up so I ended up somehow sleeping through the alarm an waking up a half an hour later and told him to shut it off and that it was time to get up well, sorry I'm taking so long but we ended up waking up around 8am or 8:10 am anyways we got up he called in cause he needed to go to the doctor. then he ended up taking his sister to work and dropping me off at school but not leaving till after he talks to his old friends. then I went to school dressed in his etallica shirt that he gave to me the night before. I went into class and started to dress out for Dance then all the sudden I heard brit say something like someone go hit, it ended up being a phyk.(badspelling!) patient from up stairs who was running away and ran into the road and got hit she was still alive and yeah everything was all as well as it could have been. then we wet over our Dance which took a litte ime cause wen had to incorperate Carli into the dance then... after that then went to adv. bio./chem. of which I didn't have my stuff for cause I slept a daniels. then after school Daniel came to pick me up and we went to his siter's work cause she needed lunch. We went and got lunch ( of which tader tots are the best) then he took me home where I ate more.( god, I really am gonna become a fat ass,just sooner than I thought.)well, anyways I tookanap and woke up arund 7:30pm and I got calls from Daniel, and then  got online and I saw that my mom's GF sent me an E-mail telling me that there were these two cats looking for a home!!!! I automatically got offline and called Kath and yay! I get to hve two cats. Yay!I'm so excited( sorry I made you go through my whole ay and I'm sorythat Idon't write things well, caue really it wasn't that boring of a day) but yeah anyways. One is a boy and his name is fearless, and they said hes more of a people person and, the other one is a girl and her name is Tannah, and she likes to hide. but they're around 9 years old and they've lived together for just about hat long so thay don't want to seperate them, and the only people that have responded is no kill shelters and a woman who has a child , but she only want one of them, and then Me. Yay! I'm so excited. I used to have a cat his name was Chaos but my brothers girlfriend took it. and now its living with them up in flagstaff where its freezing its ass off, and now its not a people cat anymore. it stays up stairs and last time I visited I only got to see it for like 10 seconds. but yeah.. chaos was born on my back poarch and he had a bad eye so... I took him in and plnned to only have him till his eye was better but that all of his seven brothers and sisters showed up and they were all so cute. I wanted to keep all of them, but my mom didn't like the Idea. but they kept coming to my front poarch and I fed them and I would take chaos outside and let him play with his bros and sistahs but then one day they all never came back.I got so sad. but.. Chaos's eye got better and him and Padre kept each other company and they liked toplay around. it was so cute. but yeah...Omg I'm so excited. If any of you have a cat that you can't have or you're moving and can't take with you. seriously I'll take it in I love cats.

Not only that.. one of my boss's osthe ten year old daughter last night due to a drunken driver. I don't really know how to react. I started crying earlier when I was looking at artwork made by kath's student in tribute to Olive. it was just soo sweet. and I really want to make my boss a card not that it'll help but..I want her to know that she has support. 

  I keep hearing weird noises arond my house. I kinda feel tht its because one of my neighbors moved away. They always brought me comfort being in the house alone. Living alone is starting to get to me. Everyone has someone to look foreward to or not look foreward to when they come home. I have nothing.

"event","Life. 
What is it?

Last night I had his weird dream that someone let me drive their car and I was driving it like I was in Grand theft Auto. ust like I could do anything. It's amazing how much that game is like actual life. 

Why is it that people make things life-like while being in life themselfs?
Why does life have to be this unsloved mystery?
Why does life have to be a mystery?

So many questions I'd like to ask. yet to some people they'd be meaningless.

Well anyway... Today was pretty cool I got to be with Daniel most of the day. We stopped by a few different places and chilled. 

I actually got to talk and chill wit my bro John today. We went to Sweet Tomatoes. John invited one of his room mates along. I thought we had a good time but.. I guess thats just me. 

but yeah.. I'm sorry I didn't go into great detail of the day.... tired yet restless."

"event","last night I could berely sleep. I would literaly wake up every 20 min. Eventually it lengthened out to every hour but the last dream that I had freaked me out and made me not want to go back to sleep. 
It started out with My dad his girlfriend and her two kids went to a party at one of my mom's either brother or sister's house, which was really weird cause why would they invite dad along?but anyways... we went to the party and everyone was chatting all the little kids were running around, and every once in a while you'd hear one of them screaming because they raninto a wall or something. My dad was in the corner( being bored) and picking out blue candies out of the candy jar. there was also an insanely large bowl of gummy Life Savers( of which I used to love ) so.. when I first went over there I took only a few and sat down and just as I got back up to get more one of my aunts or uncles(is that how you spell it?)anyways... shouted out to the kids that there were goodies on the table. and at first it didn't strike me that it was the gummy life savers that I was going for. So like a stampede they trampled me at first but then I funght back to get the last three gummy Life savers. and to savor the life savers I went outside only to find chester.(I wasn't too dreake out but I now cue as to how she found out where one of my family members lives.) we talked for a little bit ony to settle on the Idea that she was going tospend te night that night. so I went back in to tell my dad that I was going to the house cause chester wanted to come over.( and Chester was stil ot side waiting for me.) and probably less than 5 secs. of walking inside the front door my uncle David told me that none of my family members liked me, and wanted me to leave.(!!!!!!!) WHAT KIND OF A FAMILY DO I HAVE HERE? and what knd of a family would say that to someone? anyways... I could see that my dad was still sitting in the chair in the corner next to the jar of candies and empty bowl which used to hold Lifesavers.but he did nothin. He didn't say anything he just sat there and continually sorted the blue candies out of the jar. and his girlfriend Tammy was on the floor playing with all the kids( cause thats her profession, shes a professional babysitter) and she didn't even realize what was just said.  So.. of course I was pissed. So... I yelled out to my family"" Is this ow everyone feels?"" and I got one of the worst responses in my whoe entire life. They kinda had this order of coming to me from where ever they were in the house and told me to leave. and make it easier on everybody. Well why the hell should I make it easier on you when you are all ganging up on me?(deep breath) then I made a statement about one of my aunts of which I was told that she would not be at the party and I got the feeling that she would never give up on me. Even if she wasn't of actual blood realation. I said something along the lines of"" If she were her she would help me."" and I looked down and she was sitting right there and she basically just rolled her eyesin away I'v never imagined that eyes can be rolled. So I said F* this and stormed out to find Chester right there. She saw that something was wrong but she didn't want to ask.I realized that I had no shoes on so... I walked back inside to get my sandals and for some reason I wore socks with them cause when I tryed to turn my sock right side out a shit load of gummy life savers fell out and after that a shit load of blue candies came after. My dad started laughing. Everyone else looked at me like What the F*. so I threw the sock grabbed my sandals and slamed the door only to find my mom right in my face and she tryed grabbing me. Kinda like the grabbing where people grabb you on the arms and you have no control. and told her to let me go causeI waspissed off that she wasn't there for me. No one was. Chester wasn't even outside anymore. So... yeah.. I guess my body couldn't take any more pressure from the dream or from the fact that I'm/soon not going to be, severely sick. but yeah I woke up in a sweat. I haven't sweat for a dream in a long time.

"event","So... I actually went to school today. YAY! I was so happy and so excited. I saw old teachers new kids, old friends and everyone was so happy and cheery. Then I saw an old friend from Central that I used to party with and she told me on how she had seen my recent ex and yeah ...that just brought the whole day down. There is just some ties between me and him and I'm so ready to get on with my life but I know I won't be able to do that untill I've talked to him. But I'm not sure if I'm ready to confront him, face-to-face. At the time being at school I didn't feel it was right to talk about it cause I felt that if I did then I would burst into tears and I really don't want to be remembered for that.

But yeah after school Alex, and I went to the Willow House and got some Pita and hummus. WOW! I was so happy. That was the best meal I've had in a long time. We were sitting there for a while and just talking and a discussion about him came up. We sat there for a while and I can't beleive how long we talking about this subject. I was astounded that she would let me talk about it. With alot of other people its kinda a touchy subject like some I know don't want to hear anything about this guy ad in a major way I can totally understand but I needed to get this out of me. It wasn't any better of a place but it was more comfortable( somehow). We ended up swapping stories which made it easier for me to bare and not pour my eyes out. but after leaving the Willow house we ended up going to Metro mall, to look for a back pack for alex, we ended up finding her lik 4 pairs of pants andtwo shirts and a small bag.

After a couple of hours at the mall with Alex spending more on clothes in one day than I could spend in one year. I ended up going home to find that I saw a familiar name on the callerID and It was Nicole Staron, but it wasn't actually her who called, But ""HE"". So.. She told me all this crap that he and his little buddy were doin. and it seems like he really wants to get a hold of me. For what I don't know but.. I don't know how this is gonna end start or even happen. I have no clue of where he is gonna pop out of and I'm scared to go anywhere that we went together which is kinda like everywhere. 

But yeah I just want to thank Jeremy, and Alex for both bein there to talk to. Hope to see you guys tommorow.  Yay! yoga tommorow!"

I don' t know if I want him to be there or if I'm afraid. The last time I saw him was on the bus. I felt like I was gonna throw up when I saw him get on. I didn't want him to see me cause I didn't expect to see him. I felt as if I was ready for it. So many things were goin on wit us it was unreal. 

Well yeah...school starts tommorow. I'm so nervous. I hope everything goes well.

"event","Damn Emotion! Why does it have to strike you so hard. I miss the days when it was alright ot be careless about anything. Last night was hard. I fell asleep crying, I have these two different people stuck in my head and what they did to me. They've both hurt me, and I don't even see them anymore but I guess thats part of the reason it hurts. 

Its all a triangle, My own flesh and blood won't get over the fact that I went out with one of his old friends that he now hates, Even though he went out with now three people of my relation, two of with I have been close with, and the other not as much. He thinks that I shouldn't use that as an excuse, but now that the two that I was close with no longer talk to me and he dosen't want me to say it was him. He dosen't want me to be able to fight back with truthful facts that he can no longer fight against.

The other is just the one my brother hates. In a way I hate him my self, but then for some stupid reason I still have feelings for him. I don't even know if I should feel anything. Technically, we're not boken up, but we might as well be. Hes sleeping around with other little girls, of whom of which I feel extremly sorry for. I feel bad that I wasn't there to warn them about him. His actions. His Drugs. His Abuse. Why did I let him do that to me? Why did I defend him and push precious friends away? Why do I still care? Why should I care?

Why is it when little girls get told to not get into trouble, they go looking for it?"

Why can't it just be us and nothing else? We had our bad times just everyone else but.. still you give up. I never see you any more. Although sometimes I feel as if I hate you. You for being stupid enough to not regain the balls to talk to me. Why? whay can't you just grow up. I hope we can put things behind us. Because we're family, and at least we could have been, in a way we still could be. I hope you turn up back in my life. I miss you alot, and everyone asks about you. But thats besides the point. I miss you and we used to be cool. but now there is no trust no blood, no true and honest feelings, my mind deceives me. I wish I knew exactly how to feel about this with out my mind splitting. But for now I miss you."

No offence to some other kids at work but... yeah your not as fun to work with. but yay. beside that, Boston Market sucks for cutting back my hours just because I have a second job now. You Bastards. The only way I actually got hours is because of Abby going out of town.  

But yeah.. Over at Bank One Ballpark(B.O.B)things are starting to settle down. I'm starting to get comfortable with the surroundings. I got some kids to chill with, and I might end up being a lead of my own stand sooner than I thought. Yay, raise! but yeah... There is kinda this thing that could be a problem. I Like this person but... As people should know you shouldn'tdate someone from work, and I'm not sure that me and this person would be good together. I might be repeating bad things from previous relationships. 

but yeah... soon enough I'll be on my break from both jobs. Then I'll actually get a chance to chill with people. and actually go out. Yay!

I have neve had a relationship, that I was truly happy in.

I mean I've had good ones, but they always ended bad, or was just bad to begin with. I... just don't know how that could come to be. I'veput effort into some relationships. and others I kinda just let things roll. but never have I been TRULY happy. 

I don't know why... But I guess this is what I am/should be looking for. 

but I hate the term"" MR.RIGHT"".

Why does it have to be ""MR.RIGHT""?

I am now back on my vegetarian track again.I know it sounds stupid but I some times feel it right... and hopefully this time I'll be able to stick it out.

Oh wow... I got stocked by this guy today, not a bad looker but... I first saw him on the red line bus going west at Central and Cambelback and he got on the same bus as I did. but at the bus stop he would not stop STARRING. Of all things guys, I'm sorry but the least you can do is try to not stare and make it obvious.but not only did he get off at the same stop as I did but he followed me into where I was cashing my check. So, I rushed my ass out of there to where I found one of my old  Girlscout leaders(not that this has anything to do with the stalker) and we chatted for a while at the stop and I got on the wrong bus just so I wouldn't have to see that guy again. I could've sworn that I saw him come out of the store and looking around just as the bus was coming. Thank you Mr. J.

"event","It started with me wakin up one to many times in one too many places scattered around the house in miscelaneous places. Alone in the house only with my furry companion Padre. Who would wake up to continually to lick him self for hours. But I love him none the less. Hes always there when no one else isn't...and then some. I ended up spending more than half the day trying to equip my full eight hours of sleep, which I doubt that I did. Only to fully awake to go online and check meaningless e-mail, and to attempt to write in this jouranl only to cower away. I really don't knw why I'm writing in this but... I hope soon to find out if it will affect anything. I ended up talkingt a friend that Has gotten p'd off that I haven't IMed him in a while. I appologize to him. I regretably cut ourconversaion short only to wait 50 minutes for te bus to catch to work. Only to spend another Half an hour on the bus with ""who knows who"".(later story will explain quotations).  I ended up getting to work early, well just early enough to wait on a stair surrounded by co-workers but not knowing any of them.( you could say sometimes I have a problem making friends,unless forced).  I ended up working in a stand with a girl I thought that would drown the mood of working with people period, but she ended up being pretty nice. My first and only day that I had worked with her before I found her to be a very, very and I do mean VERY controlling person. But on the side of that she didn't bring down the game. I am used to having actual customers to sell to rather than Imaginary ones with imaginary situations.(probabl did't make sence there but... oh well). The night didn't end up too bad. I got a $1.50 in tips which I am proud of cause for the first time a customer actually asked if we take tips rather than just throwing money at my face.( sounds weird ) but I would just like to thank that guy for his gaditude. Even though He only wanted half of an actual small cup of yogurt. Which, I'm sorry to say, A weird thing for a guy his size. but yeah... the day was ruined I didn'tdo anything really constructive. ...I hope tommorow is better."

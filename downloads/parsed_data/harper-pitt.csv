Happy bday, hun! I hope you have a great day today! It's saturday, so I hope you have fun... go out, get drunk! It's not everyday that we turn 21!!!

I wish you all the happiness in the world, you really deserve it. You are a great, sweet person and I love being able to talk to you, even if it's not that often, it's really an honour.

Love ya!"

"event","So I decided to make a different friends cut!

I created a new LJ, because even though I still love Harper, I'm sick of the name! I'm adding to my new LJ the people that I feel closer to, the people I talk more to... 

If I didn't add you to my new LJ and you feel like you really want me to friend you, add me and we'll see what happens! I know nobody will want that, but whatever! lol!

Here's my new LJ: <lj user=colourless_aura>

PS: I'll start posting on my new LJ on Monday, June 19th."

I can't wait for Tuesday!!!! My friends and I are going to this bar to watch the game, it'll be so much fun! I'll definitely have pics of all the Brazilian people watching the game... we're not as much fun as the English people but I think we'll do ok!

I'm trying to convince my mom to go to an Irish Pub - O'Malley's - to watch England X Trinidad and Tobago on thursday. There are plenty of English there watching the games and I want to meet one!

If there's anyone online, please talk to me! I still have to be here for 1 more hour! Urgh! 
It's ok, though. When I get home I'll sleep through the afternoon and only wake up to watch SNL! lol! What a way to waste a day, huh?

OMG! I was watching the episode of <i>The Soup</i> that I had taped and they were snarking on those entertainment shows and I couldn't believe what I saw! This woman from ET, I think, was interviwing Jennifer Aniston at the premiere of <i>The Breakup</i>... can you believe that she asked JA what was her worst breakup ever? I mean... WTF? She must have reported JA's worst breakup at least 200 times last year! How clueless is this woman? I laughed so much at this absurd! Seriously, fire this bitch!

Friday, June 9th, my BFF Mauricio is going to play at <i>Outs</i>. Whoever wants to come will be welcome! Do you want to come, Cris? We can get drunk!!!!!! I don't even know if you like the kind of music they play there... lol! It's on Augusta Street and women don't have to pay. It's his biggest show ever! It'll be so much fun!

This week I took my 1st English class ever! I gotta admit it was kind of fun.

My mom is out of town in a business trip and I'm all alone... I'm so bored! Who wants to come over and party? I know my mom asked me not to throw parties, but she's not going to find out anyway! lol I'm just kidding, I don't think I'm in that age anymore.

Oh, it's almost certain that my University will go on strike next week. Fun, huh? Not really, but I'm kinda glad, because I haven't really been a good student this semester, so maybe this break will be good for me.

Does anyone here ever had Kidney stones? Nope? I wish you never feel this pain, it's the mother of all pains! It's worse than labor... at least that's what I was told ;). Anyway, because of this damned pain, I had to spend the night in the hospital, with people sticking me with needles... urgh! What a nightmare! I hate hospitals! The worst part? I might need surgery..."

"event","there's a civil war happening in my state right now. It's such a huge chaos and I'm so afraid of leaving home. There are gangs killing cops on the streets (one of them was killed on my street) and setting bus on fire. I couldn't even go to college today, my mom took the car to go to work and I was afraid she wouldn't make it home. She did, and she's ok.

I'm still having problems with my internet (I'm at a neighbour's house rigth now), so I won't be able to post for one more week. If in one week you guys don't hear (or read) of me, is because I'm one of the victims of this shitty ""war"".

Bye, guys! Love you!

"event","... of how greatly I blew my Latin exam today! Go, me! That exam was ridiculously easy, but I just forgot all the cases and all the declinations. Seriously, I spent hours yesterday memorizing those things and translating texts, but when I was supposed to do that in my test, I just couldn't remember anything! Oh, well! My final test can save me, so I'm not desperate yet!

<lj-cut text=""Reasons why I had a good week"">1- this week Laura, Ju and I stayed a few days at the Uni in the afternoon so we could study together and help each other... but you know what are the chances of 3 friends getting together to study and actually get any studying done? Well, with my friends and I the chances are really slim! So, we tried to study for like half hour and did soemthing else: we wandered around the campus taking random pics and shooting stupid videos. It was so funny! The really put me in a great mood!
<a href=http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/?action=view&current=USP133.flv>First we try</a>
<a href=http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/?action=view&current=USP132.flv>Then we learn</a>
<a href=http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/USP093.jpg>Ju, me and all that Jazz</a>
<a href=http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/USP094.jpg>Laura humping a tree</a>
<a href=http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/USP121.jpg>This was supposed to be a Charlie's Angels kinda pic...</a>

2- I found out a friend who used to like me is dating! I'm so glad he's moved on... one of the reasons I was so depressed was that I couldn't turn him down because I didn't want him to be sad and hate me. What I did was worse, I just didn't give him an answer and now he probably hates me anyway, but at least he's happy. I'm sure now he believes every word I said about my being scum.

3- Today I bought tickets to see the Sao Paulo game tomorrow! It's going to be great, there's going to be an homage to a former coach who died last week. And it's the first time ever I go to the stadium watch a football game! I'm so excited! 

4- Laura gave me her <i>Everybody Says I Love You</i> DVD!</lj-cut>

PS: I'm in love with <b>Jenny Lewis with the Watson Twins, Ivy and Sufjan Stevens.</b> All highly recomended!"

We don't actually like her, because she's really boring, but we wouldn't ignore her, right? Anyway, she came to ask us if we had written our essays. We were like ""WTF?""! Apparently, there was an essay due today and Julie and I had absolutely no idea! lol! This paper is 20% of our final grade! I talked to my professor and she'll let me present it on Tuesday. *Phew*

<b>Not so funny</b> was what the directors of the students centre - they are all members of the Comunist Party - did to the part of our building that is supposed to be the place where we (students) hang out. It's also the place where we xerox texts and stuff. 
<a href=http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/cysvital/USP071.jpg>Here's what they did.</a> Where I come from, this is called vandalism. And apparently I'm a fascist because I want the people who did it to be held responsible and because I want them to be punished."

Usually, i hate going to the park, because it's always crowded and usually, we have to go there walking, because we live like 15 minutes (walking) away. But today my mom was nice enough to suggest that we should go by car.
Even though, I hate going to the park (because I hate execizing), there are 2 things I absolutely love about it: the babies and the dogs! Seriously, people who see me at the park must think I'm retarded or something... I just can't see a baby or a dog without going ""awwww"" and making weird noises... Yeah, I know! 
Anyway, of course it was sunny and I left the park with my t-shirt marked on my body... I look so sexy!</lj-cut>

"event","First of all: Thank you all for supporting my previous entry.

Now to my entry:

I was coming here to tell you about my great weekend and how great my day was, up until the time I got home, here's what happened:

<b>Friday:</b> Adan, Bruna and I ditched school and went to Laura's house to surprise her for her bday. It was great! Thursday, Adan called Laura's mom to tell her about the party and she told Laura that we wouldn't have classes Friday. Laura loved the surprised, because she had been really sad... thankfully, we achieved our goal and the surprise cheered her up!

<b>Saturday:</b> I finally talked to Candy <lj user=candy06>!!!!!! I had missed her so much! We had a great talk, it was great!

<b>Sunday:</b> Sarah <lj user=ame_infidele> commented on my LJ for the 1st time evah! lol! And I went to a Italian restaurant! yum! 

<b>Today:</b> I went to the bank cash my salary, then I went to the mall with a friend, cuz we were going to watch <i>Inside Man</i> there. While we were waiting for the movie, we went to this book store that also sells CD's and DVD's. We were cheking them out and I found this pack which contained <i>Melinda and Melinda</b> and <i>The Purple Rose of Cairo</i>... I had money with me, so I had to buy it. Money well spent, I know! 

When I was coming home, I noticed that someone from work had called me, so I called back to see what they wanted. I was on the bus, so I didn't hear very well, but when I got home and checked my emails, I found out what happened. This guy, emailed the school where I work saying he was from England, living in Brazil, and he was interested in teaching English in our school. My boss replied the email and the freak replied back in Portuguese saying that I liked to suck big dicks! It was so weird, I wasn't even working! How did that person found out where I worked? Who the fuck was that? I don't even know what to think about it... I think I'm still in shock! I mean, I'll never find out who that fuck was!"

"event","There's a topic over at goldderbyforums where they are discussing the ""Best Actress in a Comedy Series"" category and even though most of the people there are predicting that Marcia probably will be nominated, they are all saying she doesn't stand a chance at winning. They're saying she hasn't done much this season. I'm sorry, but I don't think we are watching the same show. Marcia was the best thing about the show this season (IMHO) and has put everyone else to shame. 
I think Felicity a great actress and all, but her storylines have sucked and if it was up to me she wouldn't even be nominated (I won't mind if she is). Same about Teri's SL this season, plus, I don't think she's all that great so she would be even less deserving of a nomination. Then there's Eva, who had a huge help from the writers and (maybe because of that) improved this season, but still, she's nowhere near Marcia or Felicity talent-wise, sorry. And then we have Marcia who had a really interesting SL and brilliant acting throughout the whole season. Ok, I give you that most of her stories were really dramatic, but she had a few comedic moments and she was great in those too. But to say that she has done nothing this season is just ridiculous. One thing is not having too many comedic moments, another is to do nothing. 

I don't know it just really pissed me off. 
<b>So, am I the only one who think Marcia is the best thing about DH this season?</b> Seriously, if it weren't for her and her SL's, I'd have stopped watching a long time ago, since almost nothing else really interests me in the show anymore."

<i>nowadays is very difficult to find people your age being as responsible, discrete and a good person such as you are. So, when I congratulated your mom I was really being sincere.</i>

Isn't he sweet? Well, even though that helped me regain part of my self-steem... I still have one dark cloud hanging over my head. I just have to solve this problem and I simply can't find the strength or the courage to do it. I'm such a coward!</lj-cut>

"event","So much has happened lately, but I'm only going to tell the least boring parts... 

I got the temporary job I told you guys about. It's an easy job, not exactly stressful, not too many hours... it's good, but when I get home I'm so tired. I don't have the energy to do anything. (yeah, today is my second day at work! lol!) Oh, I'm at work right now, there's nobody here, almost nothing to do and I have to stay here until 9 pm.

Milena, one of my best friends, moved to London Saturday. I went with her family to the airport to say goodbye... it was so sad. I felt so bad and out of place for being there, you know? They were all crying and the stone-hearted bitch - aka me - didn't shed a tear. Yeah, I save them for really stupid ocasions... aparently, one of my best friends is not wothy of them. I feel so bad... ARGH!!!!!!!!!!

Today was an interesting day. I had 2 really boring Litetature classes... ok, the Brazilian Lit class was cool, because the professor was talking about Modern Art and the Modern Art Week here in Sao Paulo, in 1922, and it was really interesting. But the Portuguese Lit class was a big bore. I'm going to quit this class... the woman asked a thousand papers and essays for the semester and I won't have time to do them. She's really good, but I don't want to write so many papers in one semester. Plus I'd have to present a seminary... really not in the mood.
Anyway, after the classes Juliana and I were hanging out, waiting for the time when we would meet a friend for lunch. We were talking with Adan and Marina and this American guy I had never seen before came to talk to us. 
Here's what we found out:
There a group of American students (from University of Minesotta) in my Uni - they are here during their Spring Break to visit one of their friends who is studying here - and they decided to form a group of Americans and Brazilians so we could talk about what we knew about the US and what they knew about Brazil, the impression we had about both countries... it was so nice! Too bad it was so short. We only spoke in English... when I had to introducing muself to everybody I got so nervous I started shaking... really pathetic, but they were all so nice. They'll be there tomorrow too and we'll be out for pizza on Friday... for those of you who know about the chocolate pizza we have here... they LOVED IT! LOL how could they not? It's soooo good!

I'm out!"

"event","This morning was kind of hell-ish.

I left home at 7:15 am to go to school, but all the bus in my city had stopped working this morning, for some political reason. I got at school at 8:45 am, when I usually take half an hour to get there. That wasn't fun... at all

Even less fun was getting there to find out that the professor of the 1st period had dismissed the class early, so when I got there the class was over. When I was preparing for the 2nd period, I found out my teacher didn't go to school because she caught conjunctivites. So, I basicly went to school for nothing today. I did have conditioning workout there at 5pm, but I wasn't willing to stay there the whole day. I was so irritated.

Then Bruna, Laura and I decided to but our Latin books, but there wasn't any books in English, so we had to buy in Spanish. I know absolutely nothing in Spanish. I don't even like the language... it'll make learning Latin a lot harder.

When I got home, I got online and a friend of mine came to talk to me and she said that the place where she used to work was in need of a person to be recepcionist there for 2 weeks, while the other girl was on vacation. I called there and got an interview for tomorrow. It's an English school. I hope I get it.

With the money I get from this job, I'll either buy rollerblades (I know, it's my eraly quarter-life crisis) or a mp3 player. I'm not sure which one... probably the mp3 player... it's less ridiculous..."

"event","First and most important: <b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CANDY!!!!!!!</B> You old thing! j/k

<b>About the Oscars</b>

- I went to bed at 3 am, because of the Oscar. I was so excited after <i>Crash</i> won. Not because I was happy for the movie - I liked it, but I don't think it was worthy of Best Picture... I liked it better than <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, but I think BM has more of a Best Pic quality to it - but because I was so surprised! I had to comment on it with everyone online! I know I'm a dork.

- Didn't like that Crash won Best Original Screenplay over Woody Allen's brilliant Match Point. I think I said I wouldn't mind if Crash won, but when it happened, I didn't like. I knew it was going to happen, so I should be prepared, but aparently I wasn't. Oh, well.

- Loved that Rachel Weisz won! She was really good in TCG! But I was talking with a friend about it and we came to the conclusion that anyone who played that part and didn't embarass themselves would've won. I think they awarded more the character than the actress, but Rachel was amazing as Tessa, so I'm really happy!

- Even though I wasn't exactly excited about any of the nominees, besides Match Point, Rachel Weisz and Sophie Scholl (for best foreign film), I thought the cerimony was rather enjoyable. They could have had less montages, though. It was a pain in the ass, but Jon Stwart was great and I especially loved the parts with Tom Hanks, Ben Stiller and that ""FYC"" Campaign.

<b>My day after the Oscar</b>

- I overslept (go, me!)... my alarm didn't go off. Not my fault! The wrost part is that when I woke up it was raining and I almost didn't go to school... again! I'm glad I did, though, because I found out that I already missed 3 German classes and I can only miss 7 in the semester.

- After the classes, I had to witness one more fight between Bruna and Bruno... I missed them, but I surely didn't miss their sick relationship. I really don't understand how they can keep doing it with themselves.

- Bruna came home with me because she had asked me to tape an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 and she wanted to watch (she doesn't have a VCR). After she watched it, we had the brilliant idea to get my guitar (which I can't play, but she can) and record us singing... it was so awful! You guys have no iadea! It was so funny! My voice is really awful and I simply can't sing in tune!

- I got my Lehrbuch today!!!!!!!!!!! Finally!

I just can't believe a word she says (Candy, I need to send you the latest gem!). I know I shouldn't worry about it, but it just bothers me more than I thought it would!

I have to go to work tomorrow! *pukes* I don't want to!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","There were so many updates today! Unfortunately, I took this cold medication that makes me really sleepy, so I won't be able to read all the entries, but I'll do it as soon as I feel better!

Today I didn't go to school, cuz I could barely get off my bed in the morning. I couldn't go to school, but I menaged to go to the movies (if my mom finds out, I'm dead!). I watched <i>Sophie Scholl</i> and it was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I saw this year! Really good. The lead actress did such a great job! I loved her performance... the whole movie is amazing! I was so proud of myself! I understood a line of the movie. The guy said: <i>Ich bin der Vater</i>, which means <i>I'm the father</i>. Yay! The only thing that sucked was that I have to get out of the theatre in the middle of the movie because I had used all the tissues I had and my nose just wouldn't stop! I kept sneezing throughout the whole movie. I feel bad for the people who were watching the movie with me!

After the movie, I went to my dad's, because I hadn't seen him in a while. I didn't stay there for too long, because I was feeling really, really lousy! But I did get to take pics with him and my brother. But the pics I really want to show you are Meg's!

Isn't <a href=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/cecezelly/Cynthia005.jpg>she</a> <a href=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/cecezelly/Cynthia002.jpg>cute</a>? I know she's kinda dirty, but she so cute! My brother and my father were telling me that they think she's pregnant. If she is, I'll definitely take pics of the puppies! I love puppies!

One last thing before I go. I can't say that to my friends, because I know they'll say it's not true, but it is: <b>I don't deserve the friends I have.</b> They're all too wonderful for me. Seriously."

I'm bored... Carnaval bores me! Seeing half-naked women is not something that excites me, unless, of course, they are set on fire during the parade. Man, I wish I had seen this live, but unfotunately I have patience for such thing. Seriously, any person who can listen to the same song over and over gain for 1 1/2 hour has some kind of problem... 

Yesterday I had a good talk with Lauren <lj user=untoldsarcasm>. She's one of the coolest girls I've met through DH, seriously, you all should talk with her sometime!

Dear lord, Milena is desperate! On March 11th she's moving to London and she's sending me hundreds of messages with the address of the place her ""going away party"" will be. I'll miss her so much! I've known her for 6 years... wow! I had no idea it was that long! I'll definitely go to the party, the only problem is that Mauricio's show will be on the same day at the same time!

"event","Boredom is taking over... To prevent it to happen, I'm downloading the <i>Walk the Line</i> Soundtrack. It's weird, because I didn't like the movie, I didn't think Reese was as great as people say and I don't like country music. I have to admit, though, that I did like the songs played in the movie and I did like Reese's voice.

"event","Today was being a very cool day! I chatted with Leila <lj user=leil_friends>, Candy <lj user=candy06> and Emma <lj user=paper_hearts_x> and it was very cool! Then I went back to work, which I thought would suck, but it was actually cool! My friends went to see me! Ok, Carol went to see me, Diego and Feba went there to get free movies and to use the internet for free. They stayed there until we closed, so time really flew! I was really glad that Carol loved <i>Match Point</i> as well! I knew she would because we're both Woody Allen fanatics. We were supposed to watch the movie together, but miscomunication is a bitch.

I was all excited cuz I was going to watch Sophie Scholl this week and guess what happened? I lost the money I got at work! Can you believe that? I can't believe how stupid I am! I had plans for that money! I was really devastated, I know it wasn't much, but damn! I spent 7 hours of my day in that hellhole, I should get that money! The best part was when I got home, realized I had lost the money and started to cry... my mom, who is as tactful as Lynette, came to me and said: ""You had your wallet with you, you had your bag with you and you put your money in your pocket? Of course you lost it!"" I was so mad! I mean, I know I'm a stupid ass, she didn't have to rub it in my face. I just told her to fuck off (my Andrew moment of the week) and cried more. I think she felt bad for me, because she gave me the same amount I had lost. I still feel bad! I hate asking my mom for money... she said I should quit my stupid job, and I want to quit, but I have nothing else... so I'll stay there until I find something better. 

What made my night a little better was Marcia interview on Ellen. By that you can just see how pathetic I am..."

- What does it mean when you dream you're in a threesome with Marcia Cross and George Clooney? Besides that you have a really good taste, of course!

- I need you people's opinion on what I should do <a href=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/cecezelly/USP027.jpg>about</a> <a href=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/cecezelly/USP022.jpg>my</a> <a href=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/cecezelly/USP032.jpg>hair</a>. I loove that it's so long, but it's a big pain in the ass to wash it... I'm thinking of getting it cut short. I'm not sure... what do you guys think I should do? I'm not saying I'll do it, I just need an opinion.

- I'm feeling so unhappy today... I don't know why. I have no reason to feel like that. Not that I have reason to be happy. I should be just numb, like I always am. To feel nothing is a bless. I think I'll move to Antartica, just like Harper... how long does numbness last there?

- I saw Julianne Moore on The Daily Show - Global Edition last week! Julianne Moore is love! Unfotunately, I couldn't watch the whole interview, because I had people over and.. you know!

- I'm going to drop Yidish... I found out that I just can't stay the whole afternoon in college! I have absolutely no patience to do that. If the classes were in the afternoon, I'd gladly take them, but at night? No way!"

Anyway, how is everybody? 

This week I went to my gradparent's. I hadn't seen them since Xmas... long time, huh? I missed them! My grandma spoils me so much! Whenever I go and visit her, she always does everything I want! She cooks whatever I want too... I'm pretty sure that's why I gain a few pounds every time I go there.

I came back Friday and went straight to the movies! Match Point is awesome! I really loved it! I love Woody, so I was sure I was going to love the movie. Yesterday I <b>FINALLY</b> watched <i>Crash</i>. I loved it! It's such a good movie! I almost cried several times during the movie. I just thought they weren't subtle at all in the way they approached the subject. It's too out there, you know? 

Speaking of yesterday, it was a great day! Milena visited me at work and convinced me to buy a camera just like hers. I think I'll go there with her buy my camera tomorrow! Finally! It not the one I really wanted, but it's a good one.
Then, after I got out, I came home, went online and who was online? The one and only Candylicious <lj user=candy06>! We had a great talk (at least I thought so), even though we didn't talk for too long. I had to leave to go to the movies. It sucks, you know, I never see her online, and when I do, I can't talk to her! Blah! 
Before I went to the movies, I passed by the store [where I work] to talk to Mauricio and and we decided that after Diego and I came back from the theatre, the 3 of us would come home and watch the Rolling Stones show together. When we got back, Mauricio told us that he had a date and wouldn't go with us. I was like: ""Come on! Did you forget that you kinda had plans with... I don't know... <b>US</b>!"" you know what he told me? ""Oh, come on Cynthia, it's a date! What would you have done in my place?"" can you believe that? I have to admit I was kinda mad. I certainly wouldn't have done that! He could have gone out with Stella any other day! Men!

That's it, I guess!"

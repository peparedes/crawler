"event","<table width=""100%"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""4"" border=""0"" class=""blogbody snap_preview""><tbody><tr><span></span><td width=""5%"">&nbsp;</td><td valign=""top""><div style=""text-align: center;"">I have just finished with the seventh and final installment of Harry Potter. I have been reading Harry Potter since i was in third grade, my teacher Mrs. Thomas introduced Book 1 to us by reading aloud when we were all done with our work. Instantly, I was hooked, and knew I must have a copy for myself. Over the next week or two, I begged and begged for a copy of The Sorcerers Stone. My brother, Richie, finally took me. I have since then been following the series with fervid impatience and excitement.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""its long, and has a subtle spoilers"">Today, August 8th, marks the day that I finish that obsession started so long ago.<br /><br />To read and re-read every single book before the next one comes out has been my own tradition, and I can say that I have followed it nicely. Before the second, I would re-read the first. Before the third, I would re-read the first and second. So forth. Therefore, my reading the seventh and final book was slightly delayed, for I had read the first and second books so many times, they were now falling apart, and I had to buy more. I ended up buying them a week after the 7th book was mysteriously delivered to my house. And I say mysteriously, because it actually was a mystery. Nobody I know fessed up to paying for not only Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but also paying for ""Urgent Saturday Delivery,"" the day that it was released.<br /><br />I am extremely emotional at the moment, and I don't think anybody can understand what I am going through, unless they too have held Harry Potter dear to their hearts from day one. He was not only a character in a book, no, that is insulting to him. He is a best friend, somebody you can visit anytime you want, and he will gladly recall any of his adventures for you on the spot. Sort of like the Diary of Tom Riddle, the first horcrux that Harry Potter encountered.<br /><br />It was with great despondency that I set the final book down tonight, at near 2 a.m. My eyes bloodshot, and the book efficiently tear marked on every page since Ron walked out on Harry and Hermione, I shut it and returned it to my bookcase. It felt like a part of me died, and trust me, that is no exaggeration. I was extremely crestfallen when I looked around the room after the last page, surprised to see that I was not accompanying Harry and Ginny to Kings Cross to drop off Albus and James. I put the book down and sighed, remembering then that I had a summer reading report for English to do, and as you know, school is stealthily sneaking up on us. For a moment, I was rendered speechless, staring at the wall as reality flooded in. I have a life. I have responsibilities. I can no longer go looking for solace in a new Harry Potter adventure, because he is done. His adventures are done, and I was with him all the way. Mine, and a couple million other supporters' tears splashing on the pages were Harry's encouragement to go on, they were the warning not to walk into that Forbidden Forest, the hatred of Bellatrix (Sirius) and Severus (Albus).<br /><br />This might sound extremely wrong and a bit insane to you, but gut-wrenching to me. It is with great unhappiness that I close this chapter in my life, knowing that nothing new will come from it. I, for years, have allowed myself to become completely immersed into the life of Harry Potter, that I have forgotten I have my own life, I have many years ahead of me. And I look upon it with great distaste, because this is not what I have been taught. For years, I have been able to forget my own, stay up for days on end, just to find another copyright page at the back of the book, desperately thumbing for more of the story. But now, I cannot eagerly await the next installment, since Miss Joan Rowlings has made it crystal clear since the beginning that there will only be seven books.<br /><br />There will be no more flobberworms, Mr. Flitwick getting knocked off his stool, no more Quidditch, no more detention, Blast-Ended Skrewts, the Pensieve, no more Dungbombs, Stink-Pellets, and Mr. Filch running after the culprit while wheezing. No more portkeys and chocolate frogs and Bertie Botts Every Flavoured Beans. Most importantly, no more Invisibility Cloak, Marauders Map or riveting stories that have you turning pages like you're insane.<br /><br />It is with this, that I regretfully and officially say Rest in Peace to Lily and James Potter, Sirius Black, Albus Dumbledore, Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, Nymphadora Tonks-Lupin, Remus Lupin, and Fred Weasley. Lastly, Rest in peace to Dobby, the Free Elf.<br /><br />And then, my farewell to Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, The Burrow, Privet Drive, Grimmauld Place, Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasley, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Remus, Fred and George, Bill, Charlie, Fleur, Dobby, Kreacher, Kingsley, Aberforth, Neville, Luna, Draco, Oliver Wood, Buckbeak aka Witherwings. To every character in that book, I express my extreme gratitude that you have forever changed my life.<br />Last, but not least,<br />To Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you Peeves.<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">""We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one,</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Now Voldy's gone moldy, so let's have some fun!""</span></div><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></div></td></tr></tbody></table>"

"event","today, was hilarious. not really. i didn't go to sleep last night, so i got up at 5:30 a.m. and took a shower.
then at 8:30, i proceeded to drivers ed.i took my pre-test and got %88, which you only need a %75 to pass. :] :] :]
then i got out to the point...
needless to say i was extremely tired... i basically passed through the day zoning in and out. it was like i was drunk, i barely remember anything.
then around 8 or 9 we got to harolds house.. me and rocko jumped on this huge chair with a million pillows and i instantly fell asleep.
then i woke up, and noticed that the couch was empty, so i jumped on that. within like two seconds, i was dead to the world.
then i wake up again, and now i'm cuddling with rocko on the couch. i think he was asleep too, but when i moved, so did he. it was grand.
i got picked up at like 10, but i'm serious, those little cat-naps made the day :P


tomorrow, i have MY FINAL TEST of drivers ed :] :] :] :] :] :] :] :] :] :] i have 4 essay questions, and 80 regular questions. i only need a %75 to pass.
WISH ME LUCK!
then afterwards, i think i might be going to meijer to get all my stuff, i really hope so, ya know.

it was boring, so alex decided that we should leave and play volleyball, and we did! it was just alex, danielle and i for awhile, but then everybody else finally showed up.
alex served twice, and each of his serves, he got like 4 points.
so we pretty much whooped ass.
on our team, team jimmy, was alex, anthony, jimmy white, me, and elijah.
on the opposing team, also team jimmy, was parker, jimmy cribbs, jake, harold, and danielle
we kinda beasted it BECAUSE we had alex and anthony.
=]
then we went to harolds for a little bit.
alex, elijah, harold and me all talked about how we met each other, and how funny it was that we're now actually friends. like i thought alex was the biggest meanie head when i was a freshman, but he's really one of the nicest people i've known. not really saying a lot, because most of the people i know are dickheads. =P
anyway, i talked to rocko for a little bit when i got home, but i basically passed out since i didn't sleep the other night, and i was running around yesterday.

"event","Today, I went to Point Place. I got at Harold's house and everything was fine. Then, Rocko and I started to argue. I went out to the deck, we argued some more. I started crying my eyes out. Already an emotional day, and the boyfriend just made it ten times worse. He leaves, then comes back out and sits down, pulls me in his lap.
He says something about all the Monarch Butterflies on the rocks.
I instantly started crying more, and couldn't stop. I didn't want to explain why, for fear of sounding stupid. I couldn't even speak. He kept asking me to, and asking me to, and all I could do was open my mouth. I think he understood though. After a few minutes of this, I finally managed to get out, ""Today is the 6 year anniversary of..."" and more tears. I couldn't get it out. Finally, he said something along the lines of ""Your grandma dying?"" I nodded, and I think he started beating himself up then, for being such a meanie earlier.



I believe it was directly the day after Mamaw .. passed away, that I was standing outside at the Monte Carlo, waiting for my mom to come out. We were going somewhere, and as usual, I was out at the car before her. That's when a Monarch Butterfly started circling around the car. It landed on the hood, right next to me, facing me. I put out my hand, and it literally landed on my finger. I've always taken that as a sign that.. it was my Mamaw.

So today, when I seen three of them circling the rocks, unafraid of us, merely two feet away, and then Rocko bringing them up..
I hadn't even really put any thought into what they actually were until he said the word ""butterfly""

My phone kept ringing.. ""Hello Darlin`"", my dads' ringtone. And there was absolutely no reason for him to be calling. Just stupid stuff. My phone rang as I was by myself at the deck, staring at two of these butterflies. It was our song. Mamaw and I. More tears.


Jesus, I cry a lot.

Rocko is adorable. I think he would be great with Demitrius and Isabella. He loves them, and hasn't even met them. He wanted so badly to go to Metri's birthday party, but of course, that isn't allowed. Like today, he asked me to change the wallpaper on my cell phone, because it was Alli and I, and he's not too fond of Alli. So I was going through my pictures, and as the wallpaper, I put up Demitrius. I showed him, and he actually smiled and said, ""Now that's adorable."" I don't know the last time I seen him smile like that. It actually made me really happy.

But today is over... one great thing.


I love you Mamaw."

Ummm, of course, what other do I make but fanart??<br />Well anyway, as monotonous as it may be, I love drawing, and I love Gakuen Heaven,&nbsp; and I love originality, so here's what I come up with...a very odd combination. I will start out with the following.</font><br /></font><br />This is Keita and Kazuki at a bubblegum store. Keita got more then he bargained for when he wanted to pop Kazuki's bubbles, as&nbsp;Kazuki alledgly mistook the action and thought Keita wanted to kiss. Well, it worked out well in the end, and they had the best time they ever had at the bubblegum store just talking to eachother and reminiscing about the days at Bell Liberty school.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000h84c/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""315"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000h84c/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<br />I never made these two before. I only drew Iwai once before, in a pic that is not in my journal, so it's fairly new to me. The position was kind of tricky, but I got over my frustrations and figured it out. Well...sort of. Ladies, (and gents), I present to you ""Shinomiya Kouji doing his best at stabalizing Iwai's wobbly hands to help him arch."" XD<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000qxx8/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""183"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000qxx8/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p><p>I...um...well you see....O_O<br />Nakajima is asleep in this picture, but he was awake just a few minutes ago. I suppose he got tired...<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000p64t/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""318"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000p64t/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<br />We all know that Omi likes sweet stuff, and undoubtably he occasionally makes the mistake of assuming that the world shares his passion. Well, in this scene he will find out he is mistaken when Kaoru wonders how he will finish the quadruptal icecream sundae.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000rry6/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""184"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000rry6/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<br />I have come up with multiple scenarios for this picture. Possibly, this:<br />Saionji is enjoying his evening relaxing in the water. Suddenly Niwa sneaks up and pushes him in. What happens next is irreversable, and bound to be somewhat regretted in the future.<br />Scenario 2:<br />Saionji is enjoying his evening relaxing in the water. Suddenly Niwa sneaks up behind him and yells ""Boo!"" to the top of his lungs.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens next is irreversable, and bound to be somewhat regretted in the future.<br />Scenario 3:<br />Saionji is enjoying his evening relaxing in the water. Suddenly Niwa sneaks up behind him and pulls him into his lap, showering him with kisses.&nbsp; What happens next is irreversable, and bound to be somewhat regretted in the future.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000kwtr/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""186"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000kwtr/s320x240"" /></a><br />Okay...well, that is it for this group. Of course, definately not forever! I am always thinking of ways that I can improve and do better on my pictures.&nbsp; That is why I highly encourage your constructive critism and critique!<br /><br /></p><p>Don't forget folks, I am still taking requests right now. I could always use help with ideas. You can find the entry in my LJ...;)</p>"

This time, I just let my mind run wild and I drew whatever I felt like. Basically, that means Nakajima, Keita, Nakajima, and Keita.

I can't to this minute understand why I drew him in pants playing basketball, but I guess it's just one of his secrets. Maybe that explains why Niwa is giving him that look...</font><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000e5sg/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000e5sg/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<br />Being the NakajimaxKeita lover that I am, I could not let this fantasy slip undrawn.

What happens after that? Well, that's my business.</font><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000d2p3/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""219"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bunnyhop777/pic/0000d2p3/s320x240"" /></a><br /><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=""#ff6ab5""><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=""#ff6ab5"">I never drew Naruse before, but I decided that he was long due to be in my picture library, so I decided to go for it.

They are sitting together in a flowered feild reminiscing on past school days, and confiding in eachother. Keita is glad to have someone to share his worries with. And Naruse?

He turned and found himself face to face with the Student Council Vice.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Nakajima-san!!"" he yelled instinctively, knowing that&nbsp;Kazuki had forbade him to go near Nakajima. Now, with&nbsp;Kazuki gone on his chairman business trip and&nbsp;Keita alone, it was only expected that&nbsp;Nakajima would use this as his opportunity...<em>to trap him.</em></font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;took the headphones from&nbsp;Keita's head and tucked them in his own pocket.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Surely you aren't scared of me?"" </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">This saying threatened&nbsp;Keita more than maddened him. He did nothing but stare at the glowing dark eyes that peirced him above his glasses.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">A&nbsp;low, distinct&nbsp;laugh escaped&nbsp;the older man's&nbsp;throat, and his eyes were staring tentatively at the boy.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I want you to go out with me,""&nbsp;Nakajima remarked simply.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;gasped.

Just like Saionji Kaoru, he wanted to be hard to get.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""No,""he said firmly. ""I will not.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">But&nbsp;Nakajima was unaffected. As&nbsp;Keita rose to go, he grabbed the boy's wrist and pulled him back down.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""You<em> will</em> go out with me,"" he restated. Then he changed his tactic.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;""I'm bored today...and I need a change of pace.

""But I can't be gone too long. Kazuki said...""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Never mind all that, Keita. That sounds wonderful.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita was bothered by the lustful sound of the emerging voice. It was as if the older boy was saying ""I got what I wanted.""&nbsp;The boy &nbsp;shuddered uneasily, wishing he never made the committment.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Predator</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Unfortunately,&nbsp;Nakajima Hideaki&nbsp;held&nbsp;Keita painfully to it. He insisted they go to a semi-formal jazz resturaunt, and dressed in suits.&nbsp;Keita felt very uneasy by his presence. Why didn't he just listen to Kazuki.<em>&nbsp;Kazuki knew best,</em> he thought bitterly. <em>He was right in saying that Nakajima-san was sneaky. I should have obeyed!</em></font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;vowed in his heart to go no further.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">But by the look in the eyes of the young man sitting across the table from him, much more was in store. A certain stirring was whirling in&nbsp;Nakajima's eyes as he tossed&nbsp;Keita his ghoulish grin.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Such a dark, disturbing face! Everything; the eyes, the mouth, the pose (long slender fingers curled under the pointed chin, head cocked to the side)&nbsp;spoke much more to&nbsp;Keita then friendship. He wanted to run from the table immediently. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Suddenly, a hand seized his.&nbsp;The boy&nbsp;yelped and stared in dismay at the predator, who was staring at him pinpointedly.&nbsp;Keita tried to tear his wrist from the tight hand, but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;of no use.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bony fingers were clenched unmercifully around it.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""S-stop!"" he cried in dismay.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;snickered.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Why should I? You agreed to come here. You should have known what you were getting yourself into.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""What!?""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;let go of&nbsp;Keita's wrist. Obviously this misdeamor was performed to instill fear in the boy.&nbsp;Nakajima then&nbsp;leaned back in his seat and cut a large peice of steak, ignoring what had just happened, pretending everything was fine. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;thought Nakajima Hideaki&nbsp;so strange. He was constantly doing things like that with underlined meanings, just to drive a point across. Was the point of this one that Keita should have listened to Kazuki?&nbsp; Whatever the reason,&nbsp; Keita&nbsp;rubbed his red wrist to relieve the pressure, making sure he kept his eyes down.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;for one did not cease to stare at the wide-eyed boy across from him He ate each peice of juicy steak while staring at the boy, enjoying the worried, painful look on his face. He couldn't wait to go back to the academy...and have dessert.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Threat</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">""I&nbsp;think you need to&nbsp;stay away from Keita, Hide,""&nbsp;Niwa Tetsuya&nbsp;remarked simply at the scowl-faced young man standing in his doorway. He stopped to tap his papers against the hard wood desk and then set them down.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I don't know what is going on between you two, but ever since this afternoon&nbsp;Keita has resisted you like the devil. He is afraid of you, and I&nbsp;think you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to stay away from him.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;Nakajima's eyes were shaded by thick clouds of evil, masked by the lens flare on his glasses. The President of the student council&nbsp;could order him to stay away, but could not force him. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Niwa looked out the window,&nbsp;and paused to think for a moment. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Keita likes me,"" Nakajima remarked simply. ""He is just resisting me because he fears what Kazuki will think. Kazuki knows I am out for him."" He smiled wryly</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;Niwa shook his head.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Hide, you really are an idiot. You're always after someone&nbsp;new.&nbsp;Oh well, I guess I'm stuck with you anyway. You might as well make yourself of use by doing some of this paperwork for me.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;ignored the suggestion and turned to leave. A small smile captured his face once again. He knew exactly where he was heading.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ""And one more thing."" A low voice pulled&nbsp;Nakajima back to the doorway, where he turned back and met the President's eyes. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Hm?""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""If I find you have harrassed&nbsp;Keita in any way, you are going to be in for it.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;lowered his eyebrows and glared at Niwa.&nbsp;The&nbsp;President&nbsp;had so little faith in him.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Of course not, Niwa.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Moonlight</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">The President's threat meant little to fearless Nakajima. He had recieved these threats several times in the past, and now he treated them as no more then threats. He stood bravely and unaffected in front of Keita's bedroom door. Then, with no further ado, burst the door open.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">There was Keita, asleep, laying across his sheets quietly, the moonbeam&nbsp;dancing across&nbsp;his sweet face. He looked very was rested, very peaceable, and for a moment&nbsp;Nakajima wondered if he should disturb the sleeping boy.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Very carefully, and very quietly,&nbsp;Nakajima snuck like a cat to&nbsp;Keita's bedside.&nbsp;The boy's&nbsp;covers were pulled to his naval, the whole of his bare chest&nbsp;exposed in the warm air.&nbsp;Nakajima looked at&nbsp;Keita carefully, a little more&nbsp;than lust clouding his eyes,&nbsp;and carefully brushed the thick sweep of bangs from his smooth forehead.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; <em>""Pretty boy,""</em> he muttered to himself, rubbing the small but strong chest in circular motion.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;stirred.&nbsp; Nakajima&nbsp;did not use this as an opportunity to stop. He continued on, smiling at Keita's disturbed face.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Kazuki,""&nbsp;Keita whimpered, in a voice that alarmed the older boy.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Sh--shhh,""&nbsp;Nakajima whispered, drawing&nbsp;Keita closer and rubbing his back. ""I am here.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;was too asleep to realize the very obvious difference between the voice of&nbsp;Nakajima and his own boyfriend. He settled deep into Nakajima's lap and fell into a heavy slumber.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Bad Dream</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">For once&nbsp;Nakajima felt more then lust for someone.&nbsp;Keita for some reason meant a little more to him, and he discovered this when he woke up in the morning collapsed on the floor beside the boy's bed.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">He sat up immediently, relieved that he was up before Keita. He moaned slightly at the painful red&nbsp;indentions that the stems of his glasses left on the side of his face. It was not like Nakajima&nbsp;to fall asleep without realizing it. He looked over at the perfect boy sleeping in bed, having rolled over in his sleep. Brown hair layered his sweet face, while the blanket had fallen quite below his chest.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima, grinning at the opportunity to see such a rare sight, embraced the moment.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">He sat beside&nbsp;Keita and continually stoked him, enjoying the sounds of soft moans escaping the boy's lips.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Poor boy,"" he muttered softly. Then, he bent down so his mouth was level with Keita's ear.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;""You must be having a bad dream, Keita baby.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;squirmed, half-asleep, unaware of the whispers and the whisperer.&nbsp;He curled&nbsp;into a ball and resumed his heavy breaths.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;smiled in spite of himself. He liked when Keita was in a sleeping state. He&nbsp;was much more submissive and relentful then when awake. He continued stroking the boy's hair, taking in every ounce of the half-uncovered body. He wished he could stay forever.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Trust me!</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">The sun set over the academy.&nbsp;Beautiful shades of dark orange and pink penetrated the sky overhead Bell Liberty academy.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""><em>&nbsp;End of a fitting day</em>, thought Nakajima, though not yet satisfied.<em> I must see Keita. Niwa was right; he<strong> is</strong> avoiding me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Angered at the thought, though aware he could reverse the situation,&nbsp;Nakajima plodded across the campus lawn,&nbsp;turning his wandering eyes everywhere he could think to look.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Then, he saw&nbsp;the boy. On the hill several&nbsp;feet away; there he sat.&nbsp;Nakajima knew this was one of Keita's&nbsp;favorite thinking spots.&nbsp;He often resided here when he had alot on his mind.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""><em>He&nbsp;will have alot more on his mind when I&nbsp;join him,</em>&nbsp;Nakajima thought saucily, nearing his prey like a savage beast. He drew near&nbsp;Keita and sat beside him casually, ignoring the surprised expression on the boy's face. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Beautiful sunset,"" he remarked simply, aware that&nbsp;Keita was staring at his handsome profile. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Y-yes,"" the boy stammered.&nbsp;Nakajima was pleased at the reverence...or fear. Whatever it was, he could not yet tell. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Not as beautiful as you,""&nbsp;the older boy&nbsp;added, tossing a wild lustful glance at the startled Keita, who could do nothing but gasp.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Suddenly&nbsp;Nakajima was overcome. He grabbed&nbsp;Keita and pulled him close, locking lips with his.&nbsp;Keita was so startled he didn't move, but instead gagged on the dueling toungue entering his mouth.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""><em>Hack! hack!</em>&nbsp;the boy&nbsp;pulled away from&nbsp;Keita and&nbsp;jumped up. He could not stay a moment longer; he had to run. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">But he should have known it would be impossible.&nbsp;His wrist harshly seized&nbsp;and pulled down. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Where are you going? It was just getting good.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Let me go!""&nbsp;Keita&nbsp;screamed. ""I don't want to be here anymore!"" </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima's&nbsp;forcefulness overwhelmed him, and tears began streaming down Keita's&nbsp;face.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""L-let me g-go-o-o!""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Aw, don't cry, pretty boy. You should be happy.""&nbsp;Nakajima pulled Keita into his lap and wiped his tears away.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Why do you resist?"" he asked gently.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I have to go,"" Keita insisted, overwhelmed by his actions. ""I'm not allowed to be here.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;&nbsp;""Not allowed? By who?""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Kazuki...""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;pushed his glasses up and rubbed Keita's shoulders in several smooth, sweeping motions.&nbsp;Nakajima was an expert massager, partly because he practiced on people all the time. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Kazuki doesn't know who I really am,"" he defended himself. ""If&nbsp;he did, they would allow you to see me.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp;Keita, however, remained unconvinced. Instead, he focused on the strong hands squeezing his shoulders. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I really am quite fond of you, Keita,""&nbsp;Nakajima continued. ""And not just for your looks.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;swallowed hard and stared at the grass.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I wish you would have more faith in me. I know I come across as forceful sometimes. Just give me a chance. Trust me!""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">The move was completely out of Nakajima's character. Nakajima rarely actually liked people for more then their looks or body. Those two physical attributes were usually the deciding factors for who he would choose next to be his.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;stopped rubbing&nbsp;Keita's shoulders and put his head over the boy's shoulder, holding his chest tightly and rocking him. </font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""You are very quiet tonight,"" he whispered.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""O-oh...sorry.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Mmm,""&nbsp;Nakajima turned his head and planted soft kisses on&nbsp;Keita's neck.&nbsp;Keita shuddered.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Are you cold?"" a low whisper hit&nbsp;his ear.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""N-no.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Scared?""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""I'm fine.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">&nbsp; ""Good.""</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Nakajima&nbsp;continued to rock Keita slowly, carefully, surprised by his cooperation. He heard Keita's breathing slow into sleep, and he&nbsp;scooped him up into his arms&nbsp;and took him to his room.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""></font>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><u><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Epilogue</font></u></strong></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Laying&nbsp;Keita down into bed,&nbsp;Nakajima crawled beside him, not bothering to remove his suit. He held the boy close and rocked him into a heavier sleep, smiling at&nbsp;his peaceful face.&nbsp;At last&nbsp;Keita had trusted him; fallen asleep in his arms. This was a great accomplishment for Nakajima, who never deemed Keita's trust in him possible. He stroked the smooth, round face and planted a&nbsp;soft kiss on his&nbsp;lips.&nbsp;At last he himself rolled over and settled into sleep.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style"">Keita&nbsp;knew that no matter how much he tried to resist, he never would or&nbsp;could escape Nakajima Hideaki.</font></div><div><font face=""Bookman Old Style""><br /><br />The End</font></div></div>"

However, his confrontation turns into a little more then expected when business turns to love with none other then his past fiend...the Queen.<br /><br /></p><div><strong><font size=""3""></font></strong>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><font size=""3"">It <em>Must</em> Be Love</font></strong></div><div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; <div>&nbsp; <div><strong><font size=""5"">N</font></strong>iwa sat absentmindedly in his hard leather seat, staring into space.</div><div>He didn't even notice the increasing pace of Nakajima's fingers as they raced across the computer keyboard.</div><div>He had been sitting in the exact same spot for the past fifteen minutes, spacing out more and more until nearly in another world. </div><div>&nbsp; ""Ah, that treasury's dumb dog has done it again!"" cursed Nikajima in his lowest, most disgusted tone. ""Trying to proceed another battle, I see?"" he continued, evidently getting some humor out of the situation. ""Well then, let it begin. Here is my answer to you, dog!""</div><div>It was then that Niwa awoke from his trance, and glanced over at Nakajima obliviously.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""What are you doing over there, Hide?"" he asked, yawning.</div><div>Nakajima cursed. ""Security! High security. He is sheilding my breakthough. I should have known that flunky would pull a stunt like this. Tetsuya! Hand me my coffee!""</div><div>Niwa laughed, beside himself at Nakajima's lack of success. He knew his right-hand man well enough to realize that he would be the one to eventually give up in the game. It was always Omi who ultimately won the hacking attacks.</div><div>Niwa fancied the thought of pouring the hot, rich coffee on Nakajima's head for a brief second, but fear prohibited him and his good-nature encouraged him to hand his friend the coffee instead.</div><div>Nakajima grabbed it, as if it were a threat, and guzzled the steaming liquid down like beer.</div><div>Niwa hung over Nakajima's shoulder and watched curiously as he sent and recieved data from the other's computer, his master mind digging through files like a pro.</div><div>&nbsp; ""Ahh, a breakthrough,"" Niwa purred in pure success. ""Looks like our enemy has gotten a cheap security system, eh, Tetsuya?""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Gah, whatever, Hide...! I just am hoping the two of you grow out of this someday. All Summer long your mind has been on hacking and frying Omi's computer...wouldn't you rather be in the gym lifting weights?""</div><div>Niwa took this opportunity to flex his enourmous muscles, which were bared through his fitted sleeveless shirt.</div><div>Nakajima ignored the comment and untempting gesture--he was almost equal in strength afterall--and waved Niwa off with his one free hand.</div><div>&nbsp; ""Maybe I can help you resolve this,"" Niwa said in more of a statement than an offer.</div><div>&nbsp; ""No offence, but we don't want your help,"" came the unappreciative reply.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;""No sweat, I'm helping out anyway.""</div><div>The King was out the door.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In the treasury room, Kaoru paced back and forth in the most irritable manner, stopping occasionally to watch Omi's progress, before proceeding again.</div><div>Omi, as if automatic, noticed Kaoru's currently upset state and looked back at him, concerned.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Is something wrong, Kaoru?"" he asked in his meekest manner.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Omi, enough of this!"" Kaoru cried suddenly, stopping in his footsteps and glaring&nbsp;at the silver top who stared back at him.</div><div>""Enough of this hacking. You are bringing folly upon the treasury. We are now the laughingstock of the entire academy. All the students can think of anymore when they here or see the Treasury is you two's illegal computer games--and I have had enough! Stop it already!""</div><div>Kaoru punctuated the speech with a slight stomp of his foot.</div><div>Omi stared in bewilderment at his childhood friend, having known him long enough to understand that this was a frim command that he would not retract. Omi stood from the computer seat and took his friend's hand, who was thus far turned away coldly.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Sorry, Kaoru,"" Omi spoke in his most contrite manner. ""But Hideaki cannot be given the liberty to take advantage of us. If I permit him once, he will take it as a lisence to lauch more counter-attacks until I do fight back.</div><div>Kaoru remained turned from Omi, who spotted a slight flush of anger on the Queen's face. He endeavored further to win Kaoru's favor.</div><div>&nbsp; ""Do you understand, Kaoru? I would never do anything with the intent of displeasing you. As for bringing folly on the Treasury I cannot stand accountable to. I have never stated a word to anyone other than you concerning Hideaki and my computer affairs.</div><div>Omi brushed his thumb over Kaoru's palm, who quickly pulled it away and turned to Omi, his peircing emerald eyes burning holes through him.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You are still not pleased, Kaoru. What is wrong?""</div><div>Suddenly a loud knocking---rather banging--at the door interrupted the moment of truth, and a slightly disturbed Omi went to answer it.</div><div>As soon as he did, the King burst through the door, his usual happy grin vacant from his handsome face.</div><div>&nbsp; ""Omi!"" he said firmly. ""Where's Kaoru-chan?""</div><div>Omi didn't answer, rather he turned his head toward Kaoru, who looked up at the King with blaring green eyes.</div><div>&nbsp; ""Niwa...I will assist you in nothing until you address me properly.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Fine. Kaoru. I have some serious business to attend with you...and Omi.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Very well, then. Sit down if you like.""</div><div>Kaoru took the single leather seat and crossed his legs. Omi poured him a cup of apple tea and served it to him on a porcelain platter.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Thank you, Omi.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Always welcome, Kaoru,"" Omi replied, still trying to redeem himself from his friend's anger.</div><div>Niwa stood stubbornly in his place, looking down at Kaoru with eyes full of fury.</div><div>It took some time, but eventually the queen was situated for the confrontation. </div><div>His eyes met Niwa's, obviously unthreatened.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""What can I do for you, Niwa?""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I am here to talk about this hacking business. It is really getting on my nerves.""</div><div>Kaoru gave Niwa his most threatening glare.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I am not fond of the whole scheme myself, Niwa, but it so happens that your assistant has been the one to make all the first moves. You might want ot think about speaking to him first, then.""</div><div>Kaoru took an affirming sip of apple tea and closed his eyes. All the while, Omi stood beside Kaoru, ready to defend him.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Kaoru did nothing,"" Omi said in his soft, serene voice. ""I have been the one responding to all of Nakajima's attacks.""</div><div>The King shook his head in disbelief.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I guess I will have to get all three of you guys together then. Sheez, what an ordeal.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""It is,"" Kaoru insisted firmly. ""Because you are giving us a bad name with all your worthless computer attacks.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Hey, slow down, Kaoru-chan,"" Niwa cooed affectionately. ""I'm not in on this either.""</div><div>Kaoru opened his eyes, and his eyebrows lowered almost instinctively.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Niwa, if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times--STOP calling me KAORU-CHAN!!""</div><div>The King had to choke on his laugh.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Sorry, really, but what else am I going to call you?""</div><div>At this, he broke out laughing hysterically, throwing his head high, his whole body shaking.</div><div>He only stopped when he caught&nbsp;the Queen's&nbsp;hurt expression.</div><div>Kaoru did not like being referred to as a child. Even with as much as he disregarded his rival's opinion, it hurt him when Niwa spoke of him in such a manner.</div><div>Surprisingly, his pained expression did not resolve to anger.He turned his head from Niwa.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Please leave, Niwa,"" he said softly, a startling contrast with his commanding voice he had been using a moment ago.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""K-Kaoru?"" Niwa offered nervously.</div><div>Omi stood in front of the Queen, and looked Niwa in the eye.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He said 'Leave' if I am not mistaken.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Yeah, I know--look, let me talk to him for a minute."" Niwa tried to shove Omi aside, but the Knight remained standing like a wooden board.</div><div>Kaoru rose from his leather seat and went to the window, from whence he looked at the campus overview contemplatively. </div><div>He took small sips of tea from there, keeping his back turned to both Niwa and Omi.</div><div>Niwa was shocked. He had never <em>hurt </em>Kaoru before...only made him angry or worked up.</div><div>&nbsp; <em>Or maybe he has been hurt before...I just didn't see it. Maybe this name thing is more important to him then I thought.</em></div><div>Niwa didn't now quite what to do. With Omi blocking his way like a feirce lion, and Kaoru mourning by the window, he felt like the complete enemy.</div><div>But something...<em>something</em> kept him from leaving the room.</div><div>It was a strange feeling in his chest--a feeling he felt for Kaoru.</div><div>Niwa was startled at the sudden churning deep within his heart. He wanted so bad to make the Queen feel better.</div><div>But first he had to deal with the Queen's knight.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Omi, please let me resolve this,"" Niwa begged to the young man whos eyes were closed, standing in unfailing loyalty to Kaoru.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Only if he does not object,"" came the reply.</div><div>Niwa's heart burned inside of him. He could&nbsp;wait no longer. Tearing past Omi, he clamored to the window beside Kaoru.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""P-please,"" he begged. ""Please don't be sad, Kaoru."" He grasped Kaoru's waist and pulled him close.</div><div>""I'm sorry...I will never call you Kaoru-chan again. I know better than that. Forgive me.""</div><div>Kaoru was obviously flustered in this position, drawn so close to Niwa, and had a hard time meeting the compassionate, lowcast eyes.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I can't stand seeing you so sad,"" the King continued in bewilderment. ""I---I feel my heart breaking. I never knew how much you joy meant to me.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""N-Niwa!"" Kaoru gasped, trying to pull away from the strong arms that bound him. ""Release me at once! We can resolve this just as well at arms length.""</div><div>Niwa did not agree. His strong arms remained firmly about Kaoru's slender frame.</div><div>Niwa&nbsp;could not lift his eyes from Kaoru's beautiful face...beautiful beyond words...his golden curls framing his face and shoulders. His bright green eyes were curiously drawn towards Niwa's. </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You...are so beautiful!"" Niwa gasped, letting his arms drop from Kaoru's back.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Niwa Tetsuya!""</div><div>Omi rushed to the crime scene at once.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Kaoru, is it your desire that he leave?""<br />Kaoru was too startled to answer.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Please do not fluster him,"" Omi commanded Niwa pinpointedly. ""Kaoru does not like being handled too much. It makes him uneasy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""That will be all, Omi,"" Kaoru rebuked him, embarressed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Yes, Kaoru,"" Omi gave a slight bow and stepped away from the Queen, though close enough to rescue him in case of an emergency.&nbsp;<br />Kaoru let his authoritive gaze rest on Niwa.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Niwa, is that all you had to say?""&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""No, Kaoru, it's not.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Well then?!""<br />Niwa said nothing. Instead, he very gently slipped his hand beside Kaoru's cheek through a veil of hair and stroked it. Kaoru's stomach jumped, but his demeanor did not change significantly, albeit his eyes widened into a startled glare.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I want to get to know you better, Kaoru. I don't want to be in a snit with you anymore. I feel...I feel new feelings for you.""<br />Kaoru was unbelievably alarmed, but could not make himself rebuttle or rebuke tha tall, handsome young man who looked upon him with love.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Niwa, I...""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Sh, Shh...it's alright, Kaoru. Just say you wish to get along with me as well and I'll be satisfied.""<br />Kaory felt his face burn into a blush under the tender hand that stroked it. He wished he could tell Niwa how he felt about him--he didn't actually hate him and he had never wanted to be in constant contention with him--and get this resolved.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I--want to get along with you, too, Niwa,"" Kaoru confessed, at first not believing these words had come from his own lips.<br />Omi all the while watched with the slightest dissapproval. He was definately overly-protective of Kaoru, and the sight of Niwa so close to him bothered Omi significantly. He had never seen Kaoru get so close to someone on campus before, except himself, and was curious if Kaoru was forming feelings for the King.<br />At such an inconvenient time as this, Omi's computer began to make strange gurgling noises. Omi turned away from the Queen and stared at his computer in bewilderment. Nakajima has stolen some of his files and had sent him a virus.<br />Omi ran to his chair and glared at the messages on his screen.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Oh...no,"" he said under his breath.<br />Kaoru turned from Niwa and his warm gesture in a moment to face his friend.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""What is it, Omi?""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""My computer,"" Omi remarked sadly. ""Nakajima ruined it.""<br />Kaoru clenched his teeth in utter dismay and disgust.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Omi! Surely you can fix it, somehow.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will try,"" Omi replied, ""But it is highly unlikely.""<br />Kaoru cast his glance to Niwa, who stood staring, looking more like something hewn from stone then a man.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Niwa...""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will talk to him, Kaoru,"" Niwa interuppted.&nbsp; ""I am very sorry about this.""<br />Kaoru nodded, and Niwa wasn't sure if it was a nod of approval or agreement that he should be sorry.<br />But whatever the case, Niwa dashed toward the door to talk to his right-hand man---or for the moment his foe---about the ordeal.<br />He stopped in his tracks suddenly and looked at Kaoru, who's beautiful eyes were following him the whole way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Kaoru..."" he began.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mm?""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "" I wanted to meet you tonight dinner. Is that alright with you?""<br />Kaoru's expression warmed.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Certainly, Niwa. I look forward to seeing you.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Six o' clock....at the Beef &amp; Liver Diner?""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""B.L Diner...? Sounds fine to me.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""See you then."" Niwa winked at him<br />He was out the door.<br /></div><div><br />&nbsp;</div><div>Later that night as Kaoru got ready for bed (tying his red yukata around his waist and pinning up his blonde curls), Omi approached him in his usual serene way.</div></div></div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""How was dinner tonight, Kaoru?"" </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""It was alright.""</div><div>Omi waited around for more details.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The food Niwa ordered us was a bit strange, but other then that everything went fine.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Did you enjoy your conversation?""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mm? What question is that, Omi?""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Forgive me, Kaoru. I just sence that you are growing fond of Niwa.""</div><div>Kaoru looked up at Omi with&nbsp;rebuking eyes, while holding his hair back with one hand, reaching for a couple bobbypins with the next. ""Fond! Of Niwa? Nonsence! Niwa is the same rascal he always was.""</div><div>Omi smiled in spite of himself. Dispite Kaoru's claims, he knew all too well that he was starting to get attached to Niwa. Omi knew everything about Kaoru...he could see right through Kaoru...he could tell how he felt through his eyes, his lips, his hands...everything. </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Very well, Kaoru. Good night.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Goodnight, Omi.""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Anything I can assist you with before bed?""</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""No, Omi. You have done everything I need. Thank you.""</div><div>Omi nodded and headed out of the room, closing the door behind him.</div><div>Kaoru smiled to himself and huddled deep into bed, under his&nbsp;piles of blankets and sheets.</div><div>He decided he would never tell Omi about his new feelings for the King. Afterall, he was bound to find out at some point. Kaoru rehearsed the night's event's in his head...the dinner...the conversation...the moonlight...the soft embrace of the King...and fell into a heavy sleep.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>[Fin]<br /><br /></div><div>&nbsp;</div>"

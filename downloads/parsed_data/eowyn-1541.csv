When my parents went to Alaska two summers ago and I stayed here alone, it was nice not to have anyone to deal with. But for some reason this time has been really hard. Ive been very lonely...Maybe its because I know this is how its going to be next year. I'm also becoming very nervous about next year...I hope i dont flunk out...college drop-out...ew.

What else...? Um, some things arent going as well as I wish they would. It'll work itself out though, no matter what happens.

Tomorrow is We The People State Competition in Montgomery! I hope we do well. I know everyone has put a ton of work into it, and I hope it pays off! :P okay, bye bye"

Like usual, its been a long time since I've posted. But that's the beauty of Erin posts, they're few and far between. Not much has been happening. School sucks more than ever. I think the only classes that are worth any time are WTP and Spanish. DEATH to all the other ones. (I dislike Mrs. Chappell very very much...for the record.)

Fernando is coming home on Wednesday.(*beams*) And Katie, Nando and I challenge you and Twats to a cuddling competition. And if Nando won't do it, then my cardboard Legolas (courtesy of KPB)will take his place and we will own. Although cardboard isn't very cudly...

Hmmm...so yeah, I'm afraid I haven't got much more to say.

"event","<P>Hey! Its been super long since I've posted! Sawwy. I went to Houston this weekend to visit Ferdus! It was&nbsp;really fun. I was&nbsp;very glad to get to see where he lives and what it's like. I went to some of his classes with him. If&nbsp;his teachers&nbsp;were MY teachers they'd definately get made fun of A LOT. We watched Mean Girls one night (so hey guys! I could've been at the Mean Girls party in spirit!) and had good chinese food in a restaraunt where mostly Mexicans worked, not Chinese people. We had some nice breakfasts...or I liked them, today I got a waffle and Fernando got a bagel..NOW who's the food loser?? (Deb got eggs benedict, go deb). I met FatCarl, (the roommate) who isn't fat, I just call him that. He actually reminds me a lot of my cousin, Logan, bc they are both really smart and into computers. So YEAH! It was very fun, I was very glad to see Fernando bc I miss him sooooooooooo much. But he's coming home in 12 days so its not too bad that I had to come back home. But now I have to make up the work I missed.</P>

<BR><BR>Last night was fun. Went out with Katis, Anna, Erin, and Amanda and sat at Shogun for the majority of the time listening to Erin read from her 8th grade journal. ""Erin (G.), you had your month and a half of love, now its my turn."" haha...


So then we went to Patrick Hoke's appartment... That was interesting. Erin and I just sat huddled on the couch..lol But then Katie and I had to leave. So we did. And then I came home. It was fun. :)

Running in circles, coming in tails

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart.
Questions of science, science and progress
Don't speak as loud as my heart.
Tell me you love me, and come back and haunt me, 
Oh, when I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing tails
coming back as we are.

<P>It's been a few days since I've posted, and I just got an order from Anna to do so. So I shall. Well....Yesterday I just sat around my house and was bored. Then Fresco came over and then Anna came over and we had a Pearl Harbor Party (until Anna and I got tired of it and turned it off) and we cooked pizza and cookies..mmmm. Then we were chilling in the kitchen when Anna busted my little squishy blue thing that wiggles out of your hands and has sparkle water inside...I don't know if anyone knows what I'm talking about... okay! SO It busted and sparkle water flew everywhere and onto my face and for the rest of the night I had a sparkle face. SOO then we went outside and sat on the swing and Ferdus sneaked up behind us and scared us! AHH. hmmm then Anna went to check on her kitties...THE END</P>
<P>Today&nbsp;I spent with Ferdinand. We went shopping and then went to Costco..and then went to rent a movie, and went shopping again then went to see the Bourne Supremacy (I recomend it) so now I'm home. :) home sweet home! THE END ...AGAIN</P>
<P>To whom it may concern: Please, would all parties note that any name starting with the letter ""F"" is a nother name for Fernando. Thank You.</P>"

   I wish that you didn't break when I dropped you. I wish that you had brains and could tell when you were falling and could let out some parachute thing so that you wouldn't land hard on the stone floor of PF Changs. Or at least throw your invisible hands out to break your fall. I think that before I dropped you, you should've invested in some sort of inflatable cusion thing that would puff out like an airbag before you hit the ground. I wish you didn't plummet to your death. I miss you. Bye Didge."

After checking the entire house, I couldn't go to sleep again - so I watched E True Hollywood Story on Baywatch. Am I the only person that liked that show? I was a huge fan of Baywatch Hawaii...Jason was a hottie. Then I got ready and visited Fresco at the Galleria and he bought me&nbsp;a shirt. :) Then I had to drive Rachael around (my cousin) and now I'm back here and I just ORDERED MOON CHILD !! AHH </P>

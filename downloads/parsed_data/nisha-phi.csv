I was in a threesome w/ Loki and a horse???? also i had a huge dick and was plowing Loki's hermaphrodite vagina, loki was fingering my ass, and somewhere there was a giant horse cock and handjobs?? WTFU why did my subconscious decide to have this dream, like WHAT. well i got to do loki that is pretty cool. not sure about the horse though

and brain, what are you doing. STOP trying to be depressed and anxious STOP IT i dont appreciate having no motivation and not enjoying things, and my stomach feeling weird, and feeling like im on some other foggy plane of existence from the rest of the world and how do i get out of this because last time i took medicine and im still taking that? why isnt it working? now 1 month and its only getting worse. ughhhh"

"event","so apparently september means time for my brain to flip out and try to become anxious and depressed and dissociative and everything. but then I'm like WAIT A MINUTE, YOURE NOT GOING BACK TO MCGILL, FALSE ALARM. but my brain is like PUCK THAT I DO WHAT I WANT. OK brain, this is not the optimal setting, wtf

anyways, so along with this comes school stress dreams, and mental health stress dreams, which ive never had that before, but OK: in the dream, i was becoming depressed again, and it was making me unable to see - sort of like it looks when i stand up too fast - my visual field was filled with grey specks and clouds. Upon reflection, this connection is pretty accurate, because that IS what it feels like - everything I experience while depressed is masked by these clouds, everything seems cloudy and foggy and I can objectively see, but i cant SEE. and that was the first thing i noticed when my medication started to work: how CLEAR and CRISP everything was. and it is, it is more foggy now than it was then.

2nd dream: last night I dreamt that i was receiving top surgery But it was for dream logic reasons in my abdomen - my chest was as it always is in my dreams, already flat. But OK. The anaesthesia didnt put me to sleep, and i was aware and could feel everything, but like the egg donation, i didnt care. It had the weird side effect that i was able to induce an out-of-body experience. I lifted out of my body and floated around for the duration of the procedure. both of my parents were there watching, and my dad, as usual, was very concerned that they were cutting into my liver (which i saw the surgeon hold up pieces of, they were oval-shaped and the size of quarters.) IDK man.

anyways there was something after this but i dont remember. I was extremely disappointed to have woken up. 

additionally, i'm experiencing empathy more and more and i really don't know how to deal with it. how do people do this on a regular basis and with everyone? like how is my mom even alive? i dont get it. Why is this good? I was perfectly fine before. sympathy works for me quite fine, sympathy i can control."

"event","aw yea back from mtl apparently me and kee are so codependent now we had to spend the whole day together after, so we took photoshoot pics in the bathtub like hiddles, on the porch, and falling off the bike. then went to class, finished exam in like 10 min, even though it was supposed to be 30 min, so i had to sit there for another 10 so the prof wouldn't think i cheated, but it was SO EASY man i've never had such an easy test in my life. anyways, kee came to my super boring fluffy child development class, blah blah, OH but on the way there, we saw business man dean o'gorman, this dude was totally his business AU clone. he even had a badonkadonk according to kee, but it was hidden behind his suit jacket. then came back and watched star trek. oh yeah, we even had a ""fili! kili! grab my hand!"" moment on the shuttle back to jfk/umass. hahahaaa

anyways, the egg donation was pretty cool. I got to prepare my own hcg injection - had to dilute it myself, used a syringe, stab myself in the abdomen. it was soo exciting. THEN for the actual collection, i went in, waited around for super long falling asleep on the chair with IV saline. finally they called me in, and gave me some anti-anxiety IV, which then i became super relaxed - so i was aware for the whole thing and could feel everything, but i just didn't care. it was really weird. I could feel the thing poking out my abdomen from the inside, and it kind of felt like i was on some sci fi alien abduction scene or something. also apparently i have an endometrial cyst which probably explains why i have such painful cramps. They tried to give me a tylenol suppository but i was too relaxed and it just fell out. hahaha

well so then they sucked out all the eggs and brought them to the lab, which i could see through the door in the operating room. I sat down in the recovery room and felt kind of nauseous, which may have been from fasting because i had some water and cookie and felt better. Then the mom came in and gave me some chocolates and thanked me. I had IV antibiotics. then the nurses were all sad that i was leaving montreal and one gave me a hug. the nurses there are so nice! and the family took me out to lunch at dim sum. I really hope everything goes well and she has another kid! They're going to keep in touch and let me know."

"event","i totally had something i was going to say last night/this morning on the bus but now i forget.

montreal x2 for the egg donation. this is it, in the next few days i will have about 8 eggs sucked out of me and fertilized in a petri dish, after which they'll be implanted in the mother. Super awesome, i'm so excited.

for the past week i've been injecting myself with puregon. it comes in a pen needle which is pretty cool and easy to use, you just turn the dial for your dose. I am really strange, right? who enjoys stabbing themselves in the stomach, but I love it and i'm sad i'm done with them. I don't even know, there is something wrong with me.

Montreal is really beautiful in the early morning because it's so quiet and deserted. But would it be worth waking up early??? probably not xD

oh let me tell you my adventures going off and back on venlafaxine. So i ran out, as usual, i procrastinate and also don't realize how many pills are left. so there was none left. then my doctor annoyingly was like ""oh i can't prescribe that unless i see you, oh the earliest is next week."" so i was screwed. But here is the interesting part: venlafaxine has awful withdrawal. It has a really short half-life so you start experiencing symptoms immediately after missing a dose, which had happened to me many times before, usually starting with lightheadedness. BUT then it escalates after a few days to full on drunken spins. It is a lot like being drunk: I felt like I was spinning head-over-heels most of the time, making me quite nauseous, and impairing my coordination (drunken stumbling everywhere.)

The weirdest was the brain zaps. I would get these pulsating electric shock sensations in my head, which did not help with the nausea at all. I'd be really curious as to what causes these. The psychological symptoms were interesting, I became more angry, irritable, and anxious. My normal state of suicidal ideation became slightly more intense (basically a change from ""wouldn't it be nice?"" to ""you should do this"" plus more frequent.) I started to every so often get very anxious and out of breath for a few minutes, that was weird, and one night I had a panic attack or night terror while awake, i'm not sure? I didn't have any chest pain like I have before, but this is probably the most terrified I've been in my life, all the same, I didn't think I was dying like I did before either. Weird hypnagogic episode, maybe. Lastly, I'm back to my dysthymic state of not wanting to do anything and taking forever to make transitions. It's really the most frustrating of them all because I can't get anything done and I'm always late. Also much much more tired all the time.

So those are my observations. It was pretty miserable, but now that it's mostly over it's quite interesting, especially because my last two medications (buproprion and citalopram) I stopped without weaning and nothing really happened other than mild lightheadedness. Is it the norepinephrine aspect?"

"event","aw man i totally forgot about LJ again.

BUT SO apparently my OTP is filikili, and this was discovered by me talking in my drunken passed out state last night, when i would only respond to things related to that. OK but I wish i could remember this, but i pretty much blacked out after the second time i laid down on the bed. man.

OK i think the one thing i cannot stand in people is low openness to experience. Which is kinda weird I think most people don't particularly care about this trait but really, even any behaviour that would fall under low openness (closedness???) to experience really irritates me. Why? I don't really know. or maybe it's just related to my considering caring about reality to be of moral importance. But no, that can't be it, because even people saying stuff like they hate art irritates me, and there shouldn't be reason for that, because people can have whatever likes and dislikes they have. though i realize more and more how easy it is to change those. Maybe it's just the correlation of one with the other. HMMMMM no it's the irrationality of those statements that i find irresponsible, because you shouldn't have such strongly negative feelings about something unless it poses some danger, it causes really irritatingly irrational decisions that also affect other people including me to be made. that isn't cool.

but really, my family is extremely high on openness and i score higher than 99% of the population. and it is this trait where I really relate to the rest of them but it is also here that i feel far from them because i'm even more open than any of them! i'd say it's nicer to be open because random unharmful things bother you less, and isn't it nice to not be bothered by things. but maybe the annoyance i feel for closed behaviors makes up for it so we're even. bah."

So yeah, we did her math homework which was about angles. The thing is she is not bad at math, i think she's just not motivated, and makes mistakes just writing the answers down. The rest of the time was just getting to know each other really.

Then I went to the apple store thingy. Apparently there was some other kid there who goes to WPI in robotics, so i asked him if he knew lltt, which yes, he did, and apparently he went to mhs also, and they were both on the robotics team. haha. SO anyways they had us watch videos about apple and did a powerpoint, we had to answer interviewwy questions and questions about apple. BUT I really want to be hired there, it seems super exciting, and i'd get to go to a secret apple training session, and if i was ever later promoted to genius level, i'd get to go to a secret genius training session in CA. YEAH wouldn't that be awesome. but i would be great working for apple. 

SOSO on sat. night since kee graduated, we partied w btrz at her house, w/ tons of alcohol AS USUAL. idk man, kee was flipping out bc i was eating all the chicken, i tried to make tacos w/ cole slaw and hot sauce, watched hemlock grove, got breast exams and had women's health 101, apparently btrz took pics of us all on the bed, but they're mysteriously missing, tetris-arranged ourselves to all sleep on the bed. somehow we all fit. AS USUAL we were all naked, kee 1st so i win that bet that we never made. but what i can't figure out is how kee had my shirt half the night? bc i remember that but I dont remember taking it off, or what i was wearing instead?

we totally forgot to write drunk hemlock grove fanfic but kee wrote something about stomas or something in my notebook. it's quite illegible."

THEN we made smoothies w/ malibu and watched crappy movies: dark harbor, blue lagoon, and blue lagoon 2. OK BLUE LAGOON is hilarious and should be played in health class to show the consequences of never having sex ed. +Kee had a dream about magnex blue lagoon, then i thought of durincest blue lagoon, where kili is the girl, and thorin is the alcoholic old man uncle who dies. mchll would SO love blue lagoon if it weren't for the wincest. ALSO dark harbor is probably mlss's fav movie since she loves snape and ~controversial topics~ such as homosexuality and large age differences. TOTALLY hits all of her kinks. ANYWAYS so THIS MORNING i was looking up richard armitage's age (41 so i remember) AND W T FUUU HE PLAYS THE CELLO. I CANT HANDLE THIS. also he plays the flute?! AND PLAYED in his SCHOOL ORCHESTRA. i'm going to die. HOWWWWWW WHAT HOW i was flipping out when i found this. i cant handle this man.

I was in a study the other day about trans discrimination at mcgill. it was pretty interesting, it was a focus group so basically they recorded us answering questions and sort of having a conversation. i got to complain about mcgill's shitty treatment of trans people, which was nice. then we got free pizza and drinks and $20. Also one of the people running it was also the person who ran the social anxiety group therapy i was in last year, apparently she's a counseling psyc phd. She told me to consider counseling psyc for grad school, since all the queers are there and there's none of ""oh we only study white heterosexual cisgender men and women, anything other than that is only for special studies on those topics"" crap that we get in every other class. hmmmmm well maybe.

then this morning i did a study where i had to listen to sequences of different timbres and tell if they were same or different. Some were very easy and some were very hard. study being done by my TA from music perception.

I'm so sad this morning i had my last music theory class, possibly the last ever, by my favorite prof. and it's likely the last time i will ever see her, so now i'm just going to have to stalk her through scholarly articles. we analyzed this awesome schubert piece. it was hilarious. schubert is always trolling you, and it's so obvious."

"event","my mind works so much better at night this is why i never want to go to sleep

but what was my point here? oh yeah, so today at cbt i had to call restaurants again, only this time make like a 5 item order for delivery, give them the address and everything, then cancel the order saying ""Please cancel my order, i'm not hungry,"" (those exact words, no apologies or other explanations to try and make it nicer.) Oh man, the first one I did suddenly after this huge wave of embarrassment came over me, ah it was just so uncomfortable, and now i was thinking about it, it was so pink, but since when do emotions have colors? i don't even know, maybe i'm just tired or something. But yeah, idk, this seems not so bad of a task compared to the one before, but it was WAY WORSE. ugh, man, but i did it, and I didn't have as much of a reduction in the anxiety, though i was a lot less embarrassed the next few times after the 1st. but well I did do it, which means i can do things, even if it's really painful. Which gives me some hope for things like getting a job. Actually though the embarrassment paradoxically while feeling really horrible kind of felt good. oh my god i am such a masochist. wtf.

besides this, it's the weird little small things that i am suddenly seeing a huge difference, for example, i am less scared just walking down the street, of things like people talking to me / asking for money / those charity people, and i would never have known how much of a difference just that makes on how you feel, but to not think about having to avoid that, to not be afraid of some unknown consequence, to know that i can just refuse and go on, smile and not feel bad. the thing is, it affects the rest of your life, that small thing, because your feelings aren't left to just the one situation, they bleed in an out of how you feel about everything else, emotions don't add up, they interact and produce something else entirely. the whole is not the sum of its parts. and i can see how people who were just afraid of their presentation can wonder how on earth i wasn't able to just do it like they did, why couldn't i just do all these things? but how could they know

i guess what i mean to say is, the world is less horrible when you have even just slightly less anxiety. That should have been obvious, but I was surprised."

woke up at 9 by alarm, WHUT THE FUU- angrily turned it off, also I was having some weird dream about hosting a party with rando people from high school, like Pt??!?! wtf. and mchll was there going to sleep over but i wanted to kick everyone else out because really, why were they even there? Lx also had a buch of her friends there from german club or something.

So anyways then i actually woke up for real at 3 and went to therapy where my therapist was like ""surprise! lets do some exposures right now!"" and I was like ""WHHAAA"" but ok, she made me call chinese restaurants to order pizza, and it was actually way not as terrible as I thought it would be, and people were mostly confused or like ""wrong number"", though one guy did flip out like ""PIZZZZAAA?!?!?!"" but that was even not as bad as I imagined, pretty hilarious actually. I did it like 10x and even with an added ""but why don't you have pizza?"" to one of them and no avoidance. I was so happy when I left.

AND now I've been procrastinating on my homework for several hours, i read like 2 pages of an article and scrolled at the file for my paper. uh, what are you even doing. spent the rest of the time eating lunch, tumblring, and coloring a pic of me and kee dressed as dwarves of course. I'm so unproductive, last night i was supposed to do work and i spent the whole time reading fanfic and talking to kee. i did find a really good fic thou

also i'm taking care of the ferrets - rory has now TWICE managed to escape into the hallway, how, I have no idea, somehow she gets into the radiator and through the wall and I couldn't find any holes in the hallway, so I think she goes through the apt next door somehow w/o anyone noticing, and under their door. but then at least she always comes scratching at my door.

fandom update: as you can tell by my tumblr, now obsessed with aidan turner's beautiful face, like how is someone even that pretty, he looks even better whilst crying, wtf. but kind of also obsessed with thorin aka richard armitage, prob. because i had a dream i was married to him with 5 dwarf children, and also he's like super cute and that fic from last night and THAT OTHER fic from last night >.> uhhh yeah obv. my new otp is fili/kili, but also bilbo/thorin, it's also my headcanon that like half of the dwarves are secretly female, also you can't separate fili&kili, if they're paired with someone else they go together

My parents are always telling me ""you need to play the game,"" but I don't want to play the game. I don't like it, I don't agree with it, I didn't consent to it, and it's not worth it. What would I get out of it anyways. 

lx loves playing the game, but you know what, it's easier for her, and maybe it is actually fun when it's just at that right level. Or maybe the rewards are more appealing to her, I always did have a hard time being motivated by things.

but yeah, fuck the game. i will go on resisting it because I don't know what else to do.

anyways I was reminded of my VICIOUS HATRED for it because of a sort of tangent related to my personality class today. In which we learned about two different mindsets:
1. Abilities are innate and fixed
2. Abilities are learned and malleable

For obvious reasons, the 2nd is more adaptive and leads to better success. But I just kept thinking of how, at least in the US and my school here, the way things are set up in public education and academia really pushes #1 on you. This seems totally counter to the point, since it is EDUCATION and you're supposed to be LEARNING, seemingly supporting #2, but you know what, that is the biggest lie ever and it is really one of the most upsetting, depressing, tragic things I've realized about the world. And that's where we get to the beginning.

Grsnd is writing an article about it since she was in the class and we talked about it after.

it's not real. it isn't real.

I'm just trapped here. how the shit does anyone have an internal locus of control anyways (and someone should bring that in on all the privilege discussions because it's totally relevant.)

angst angst angst 

other than this, i was also having a weirdly creative day and i really want to create an art form based entirely on tactile sense.  I know it sort of exists, but i still find it struggling to leave vision away. Some comes closer than others, but what I'm imagining would leave vision in the dust. I think it hasn't become as popular as art for the other senses has because people find touch threatening, which it is, because once something is touching you it could hurt you. This is very enticing to me. it could be so powerful.

++yes i changed my theme, also you may have noticed i am now referring to people by their names with no vowels because I'm tired of the nicknames, these will be easier for you to figure out anyways"

"event","I'm at the stage of CBT where I start doing exposures, which means I deliberately place myself in situations that cause anxiety so that I gradually become less anxious. I've created an exposure hierarchy listing 10 situations causing low anxiety to causing high anxiety and I'm already anxious about the top of the list because I will eventually have to do those things. But I'm trying not to think about that and focus on my first task, which is saying hi to a random person sitting near me in class, something seemingly harmless, causing 20/100 anxiety with the goal to get it to 10/100 anxiety after doing it multiple times. Then I have to document my before and after experience in detail each time and do a sort of ""risk assessment"", which is basically really over thinking the situation in a very emotionally detached way.

aggh and apparently I also have generalized anxiety disorder. I can't believe I missed that one, but I totally missed it. I always thought everything was from the social anxiety.

there is really something wrong with my brain. ah."

"event","I totally had a dream the other night that I was going to work in tom hiddleston's lab. Wtf. I have no idea why my brain thought hiddles was a scientist with a lab instead of say, Tony Stark RDJ, or sherlock, or someone but oh whatever, at least my brain has moved on to the right fandoms.

uhhh yeah I've been hanging out with balto, we went to the garment district with her boyfriend and although i didn't find any clothes that fit i got a mjolnir prop! hahahahahahhaha it's hilarious and apparently was supposed to be $70 because it's one of those serious nice props or something (still made of plastic though but the handle is nice.) everything was super on sale there though so it was instead $17 or something like that. We also had sushi and ice cream from the awesome ice cream place.

Then i also went to her boyfriend's party thing where a bunch of people somehow ended up reading the drunk fanfics russian and i wrote. also i taught everyone how to play hearts. and people argued over comic book movies and also i read a thing of the avengers and actually really liked it. Also all this hanging out with balto now I totally ship superhusbands. but that comic helped. because ok if they are together every time one of them is genderbent, that is just heteronormativity getting in the way. it's canon.

then what else? oh yeah i did an mri study! it was super exciting as i thought it would be. and supposedly they will email me a picture of my brain. I had a 3T scan and a 7T ooh fancy scan. And they did everything, MRI, fMRI, DTI, images of blood vessels. I totally want a bed in the shape of an MRI. It was so cozy and comfy inside, there was padding all around my head, with like a helmet over my eyes, and a leg rest, and then I was all enclosed in a tube. and it made really strange loud noises like dubstep without a beat, or weird ambient music. And for some cycles the entire thing vibrated. I could sleep in there. it was very relaxing. but then right after the second scan I had to do neurocognitive testing with memory tasks and stroop tasks.

then the other night russian, qu, and i went to the bookstore after failing at remembering which mall is the good one, and flipped out in front of the magazine section because they had all the fandoms on the covers. hahahahhaha the spn magazine was the best so russian and i split it. plus i got a thor comic because it had pretty pictures."

"event","Olympics! Friday night we had the best olympics party ever. it was pretty awesome, russian and i made nachos with delicious layered dip plus a broccoli calzone, balto and i made candy from a harry potter candy making set she gave me for my birthday, but kind of failed on a bunch of them because we didn't have a candy thermometer and i guess estimating isn't very reliable. Mimichan brought cupcakes and bottle coke, zarja and reina made smore brownies and serri also came. We found some party lights and russian and i made scorpion bowls with the remainder of our vodka since we didn't have any of the other alcohol required, but it was still delicious. we had four of those watching the opening ceremonies, it was pretty exciting. The best part was the queen jumping out of the helicopter with james bond, also the independent athletes. We hilariously watched say yes to the dress after the ceremonies ended, with balto this was even more funny. russian went to sleep and balto and i discussed superheroes and if there was a comic about superhero olympics who would be doing what events and how they would be different with superpowers. also, fanfic, we need to trade fanfic.<lj-cut text=""longish post"">

Last weekend we went to visit mimichan at her school and go to six flags. somehow we went on the merri-go-round like 5 times and named our horses and took tons of pictures. somehow that was like the only time i was with russian besides eating in the parking lot. lines were painfully long for everything else but we eventually went on the bizarro roller coaster which was actually pretty cool. I wish you could go at night because everything looks awesome lit up in the dark. Oh yeah we saw the Flash and Green Lantern who were really cool and excitedly took pictures with us in superhero poses. Then we got chinese food and ate and slept in the common room but unfortunately i had dreams of missing class and failing exams and missing assignments all night. But the night before that! we slept over at qu's house, and watched the lady in black and this super cute korean movie about schizophrenics falling in love.

SO other than that, I have become a professional lab rat but not a very good one, I guess, since I've only qualified for one study so far. Hopefully this MRI one works out. The first was investigating the effect of a certain medication on bone density in cystic fibrosis. I got to do a blood draw, nutrition profile (of mostly calcium), and CT scans (i got to wear a paper gown) and this fancy special CT scan of my wrist and leg. It was pretty cool, and they're going to mail me the results of my stuff (hopefully that means the pictures of my bones too.)

The second was about social anxiety, and they did a psychological exam that was like an hour or two long and recorded. But I screened out of the rest of the study because I met the diagnostic criteria for depression (I also met it for social anxiety, but that's pretty obvious.) I sort of knew that was going to happen, but I wasn't sure whether I was going to be truthful when I went in, in the end, I couldn't screw up their data. It was kind of weird, to actually receive an official diagnosis. I've known that I probably had depression since I was in middle school but i've been avoiding acknowledging it since I don't like telling people I'm unhappy. People take offense when you're unhappy, but they don't when you're scared or anxious. That's interesting, I did not think of that until just now, but it's odd. Well so I screened out of that but they had another study I could do involving a blood draw and a questionnaire, so I did that.

The third study was on gum aging but I screened out of that because they had too many people in my age bracket. I'm not sure why they didn't ask my age before I came in. At least the other one paid me for the screening.

Other than that, I've been helping Mormor move her stuff out. she has so much stuff, and she doesn't want to throw anything away.

Is it a vast difference in perspective? People seem to think it isn't disrespectful, or don't care whether they are disrespectful, or want to be disrespectful. I don't bother with mormor, maybe I would if I didn't have social anxiety, maybe I would if she wouldn't give my dad a hard time about it, but I don't think she means to be disrespectful when she blatantly refuses to use my real name. Then I get other shit about pronouns from other people, the way people talk about it is a bit disturbing. It's just that they really must be not considering any perspective but their own (i know this is a general issue with mormor, she's a bit narcissistic,) but that makes me worry about my thinking. I don't want to be unknowingly biased in that way. At least I am aware of it in other people. I think some people aren't even aware of that. That is also disturbing.

The psychologist at the second study thought that the depression would go away when the social anxiety was better, but I'm not so sure, because I think the trans issues are also a large contributor (to both depression and social anxiety.) It is a problem because I have a lot less control over that. I also worry what depression would be like without social anxiety. I also can't imagine what I would even be like without social anxiety since I don't remember ever not having it. But it's apparently easy to cure.

wait did i talk about the first scorpion bowl? I don't think i ever did. Well before, on the same day i was diagnosed with depression by study #2, we went and got scorpion bowl, also, I got my permit. i was feeling kind of weird after the study (it was a long long psychological assessment) so i went to chinatown and did the permit test, which was exceptionally easy, and the person processing my stuff was laughing at me because it was my first time ever getting a permit and i am 21. then scorpion bowl (with russian, reina, and starmie weird combo), the first place wouldn't let us in because they only take drivers' licences or liquor licences. -_- so harvard square, the place there didn't even check ids, so they're obviously way cooler. and we got two bowls since the first was so delicious. It was very exciting."

I'm sad I can't fix the big computer though, since my dad said he'd forgive me for not having a job if I could. well, i tried.

I tested out the area at the front that's nearly enclosed - shallow enough to stand, deep enough to swim! so we went swimming and I was the only one with a real swimsuit, underwear for everyone else. But you can't see that area from the rock unless you're really looking so it is perfect for skinny dipping. Then it was like mini wavepool fun times (not too rough that we would get smashed on a rock, well rough enough that we all managed to get cut on something, probably zebra mussels or barnacles.

"event","Russian and I have the best bromance now. We had a sleepover and watched extreme bromance movie El Dorado (of course, my favorite movie as a kid.) Then devised a plan to sell the disgusting blue and green crap to high schoolers. And drew pictures of Superhusbands for Balto whose birthday it was. Totally copied from other fanart, I at least changed the pose so I could draw RDJ's insanely hilarious anime eyes with hilarious bottom eyelashes. You can just draw his eyelashes and you know who it is. 

Then saturday it was Balto's hot pot party thingy, with her boyfriend and school friend. Ice cream cake, japanese supermarket with 50 cent books! I got the most depressing japanese children's book about a cute dog. It goes something like this:<lj-cut text=""continue..."">

Hi I'm Shiro the dog.
I love my owner, Mikki-chan
We like to play together
We like to eat together
Mikki-chan died!
Where did she go?
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?
Mikki-chan is dead.
I'm so sad and lonely.
I have no one to play with or eat with.
I go to sleep and see Mikki-chan in my dreams.
then she's an angel or something.

THE END! WTF!

anyways, then we went to the drive-in which was a huge drama! wooo. Brave was better than I had been expecting, also I want Merida's hair. Then snow white and the huntsman, just because THOR. and we (ie, me and russian) weren't all that interested in anything but thor, so we got drunk sort of or placebo drunk in my case because I ate too much food, and made up our own story. Drunk movies are basically fanfics in my mind. So THOR and LOKI (snow white) on an adventure battle medieval times crossover with Princess Mononoke because the forest spirit was there randomly (i have no IDEA what that was there for in the real movie.) And apparently the little faerie weird thingies were me, also there was a white haired priest guy that was clearly one of those creepy magic multipliers from game of thrones and he wouldn't die. Somehow the queen became tony stark? at least in my mini fanfic she did. I think Balto and her boyfriend were actually paying attention, her school friend was reading, Mimichan left with Qu who wanted to go home early. So we lost our radio, I'm sure that helped encourage us to narrate the entire film in our version. We could only really hear every third word - at one time I swear I heard ""wincest""

but yeah, once more, fanfics! Russian's was an alpha/omega (loki was in jotunn heat) and mine was necrophilia because of snow white and Balto's bf's comment (which became the epilogue) that ""one time I kissed a girl and she came to life"" would make a good/creepy pick up line.

AND discovered that I have a misfits-level power of being anxious on command. I suppose it's like crying on command (which is something I cannot do.) But yes, I had to look like sherlock since I had my orange blanket shock blanket, so what better way to do so than psychomotor agitation. When I control it like this, it's kind of nice, unlike all the rest of the time.

also I am making dream progress, this time, my dream, GAME OF THRONES fuck yeah, hanging out with Arya, Danaerys's dragons flying to us, we were about to get to ride on them when I woke up! but, hey at least we are moving to the right fandoms. Just ... almost ...

Today went to see Reina in boston, found that me and russian read all the same fanfic without conference, qdoba, blick, avengers bracelet making at blick + reina's rainbow bracelet, random walking everywhere, the navy was invading every street of boston people in sailor uniforms, mini shopping spree at h&m because we got intercepted by the jewelry section being next to the underwear section, bromance matching blue underwear! It's also becoming the 90's again by the looks of it.

now the days of the week named:
Mcfassy Monday
Tuesgay
Wincest Wednesday
Thor's Day
Fassbender/Fanfic Friday
Science Bros Saturday
Supervengelock Sunday

For this wincest wednesday we will celebrate by watching the episode of wincest canon where sam and dean learn that they are soul mates. FOR REAL this is in the actual show O___O.
Then we will paint! since Russian got a new canvas, and I need to start my painting again.
Also I need to start my comic.

Then my dad was pleased because i am fixing the computer, and he made me a manhattan and didn't care that i don't have a real job for once. Or he was just enjoying <i>his</i> manhattan ...
I was trained to like these, because it still tastes like cherries to me, or rather, cherries taste like manhattans, or I think they should taste like manhattans. My dad used to feed lex and I manhattan cherries as kids. GREAT PARENTING! ahhahaha so I am trained to like bourbon."

A in my bio class! Too bad it doesn't count for my GPA. I suppose i could have done no work and come out with a C and it wouldn't have made a difference. but I like bio and the rest of my class was the anti-intellectual type so it would have been against my principles.

Sadly, I think I do better in this type of environment for some reason. If everyone else is stupid, I have no doubt in my abilities, plus I'm highly motivated to do well because I don't want people to think I'm actually stupid or don't value learning or knowledge. It's like high school. It was like high school. But with a good teacher. When I'm with people who may or may not be as smart as me, or smarter, then I become very intimidated and have some sort of inferiority complex. Except for at splash, what was OK about splash? That everyone there is really nerdy? Maybe I should have gone to MIT.

But I should have gone to Salem State for my first few years then transfered to McGill to get my degree. I would have been in much better shape financially and academically. Plus I could have been hanging out with Russian.

ALSO why does no one teach you the method of loci? This should be taught in kindergarten. All that wasted time memorizing whatever for school with a much lower success rate. Plus it certainly increases creativity.


    went to castle rock last night with russian & qu, with pizza! picnic on castle rock at night with the ocean. It was pretty awesome and should become a tradition. AND we had sparklers. I love castle rock, I hope we get to see another thunderstorm from there. It's the best thunderstorm watching spot. We did get to see stars: the big dipper, summer triangle, venus (notastar,) and probably cassiopeia but I couldn't remember where it is. AND A MOONBOW! I had never seen one before but there it was, around the moon. And some really cool clouds.

Also we came to the sad realization that there will be no new fandom materials for a year. AHHH WHAT WILL WE DO!? We're already very anxious and don't know what to do with ourselves. pretty much the last thing was the avengers, now, NOTHING. as it was before, we had fandom. then we were given anime, which was like codeine. Then last year, we were given heroin! Now we can never go back to codeine it just doesn't compare. and the heroin is gone. So now we are starting withdrawal. Ah! Last summer was so good! Russian and had this conversation after flipping out and rolling around on my porch when we found out that the Avengers was leaving the drive-in before we could go see it again.

Plus anxiety is such that I block my mind from thinking of anything i could do, it is too much. But that is bad because the more time passes the more anxious I become. Time is the worst. So I'm pretty much immobilized. eugh. and bored bored, you know, so is lex, we just have opposite coping strategies, at least hers is productive, but then I live my life in my mind so maybe it's not so different.

But you know, I think I do better when I perceive myself to be a lot more intelligent than the rest of the class. I even have a huge amount less fear when participating in class. I participate?! what is this. Well hey, it's like my violin studio class with all the little kids. Minimal performance anxiety, even in a solo performance. oh.

Loki I was grabbing and pulling, moving him around, not being gentle in the slightest, did he care? no, he was perfectly happy. I'm surprised he's not bald the amount of fur I got off him.

The weird thing is that my parents are not like us in that way. it must be the shared environment that our parent's didn't share with us.

agghhh what to do. I don't even remember my dreams now. sleeping is even boring now."

"event","OH I am dying of music. OK I've been sitting here for a few hours. It started with putting music on my dad's ipod, then fixing some tags, now WOAH. I have been neglecting my awesome stuff, which I forgot just HOW awesome it is. Right now, I am in love with Schubert, or more specifically, his Op. 161 the best use of tremolos ever.

I wish I could go into some music dreamworld music-coma of some sort and drown in the waters of music. But I guess that's what I'm doing now. In my vision, it would be 10000000x more intense. I think I would implode.

Did I write about this before? It's usually the fantasia. oh the fantasia ... 

in other news, I am home, yes, mostly hanging out with Russian, or doing nothing all day, or taking the dogs for a walk. I still haven't unpacked, at least I emailed that email to the mgh people. I did figure how to get to my class at salem state. My prof is british, I am mildly excited for the lab. I do miss labs.

also I might <i>actually</i> be asexual. It's broader than I had thought. but then again, there are a lot of variables, then again, my childhood self could have predicted this so it's probably actually true.

oh yeah, A- in cogsci. that's a relief. But wtf A in music history. I didn't like that class at all. I wish it would switch with my favorite class dev. psychopathology B+. aggghhhhhhhhh. Was it worth it?? I'm not sure. No, probably not. I had better grades last semester anyways, when I was less insane.

**need to call studies, do it.
I have to stop waking up at 1:30pm. A few days ago I actually woke up at 4pm. That is really depressing. But I also keep staying up later and later. Last night it was 5am. But first of all I get distracted by the internet, second, when I actually lay down, I can't fall asleep. And not just because it starts getting light at 4:30am (though that does have an effect,) because when I've tried before then, I still take forever. I think it's because I was taking diphenhydramine for so long and stopped. Allergies are not as bad here, so I don't need it anymore. Not sure the rebound insomnia would last this long, but I normally fall asleep really fast.

OH yeah you know what was awesome about last summer? fandom explosion was so good it lasted until this summer. Still feeling the effects, has this happened since FMA? I don't think so! speaking of fandom, I found russian sherlock, it is hilarious. From the 70s, watson meets sherlock in a scene a lot like the bbc one, there are a zillion scenes of watson eating fancy breakfast alone with like 5000 plates yet only a bit of food, sherlock says ""VATSON!"", there is hilarious fluffy baroque opera overture soundtrack, also at the end sherlock asks watson on a date to see the magic flute and then THEY START SINGING IT! not the words, but the orchestral part! O_______O like me and zarja in high school.

but good news, my hands seem to be looking a bit better."

"event","LAST NIGHT I had crazy dreams of which I only remember a few bits. First I was in the hunger games or something like that, then my cognitive science teacher was a serial killer (I forget how he killed people but it was something weird and involved space?) This is not a good omen for my final exam in that class ...

I seem to have developed this disturbing compulsion to pick at the skin on my fingertips until it comes up and then bite it off. Well, except on one finger I progressed to the knuckle which now has a hole in it, also the back of my hand. And I do this until it's bleeding. I know before I would bite off my hangnails but now I peel off skin that hasn't come up yet. I do this automatically when I'm bored or something, but I really do it maniacally in my seminar class. As in, I do it with some purpose (of what, I don't know, but that's what it feels like.) Then I leave class with torn up fingers. Well my advisor also noticed me doing this when I went to see her, since she told me to stop. I hadn't even noticed it. It's most definitely related to anxiety since when I was writing my paper the other day and nearing the deadline, and going past the deadline, I was uncontrollable and finished with my hands all cut up. Definitely going insane.

1 exam done, 2 more on monday. Psychopathology, I wrote it with the OSD and I'm not sure if it did anything. I was a lot less prepared for this one than the midterm but I did really well on the midterm. OK my teacher from this class looks exactly like Moriarty on BBC Sherlock, only girl version. I should have got a picture of her before the class ended."

"event","savoy + music history paper does not mix. I write abysmally slow so having all my nights taken over by rehearsals (and cue-to-cues, since when does the orchestra need to be there for those?) is not good. Well I spent last night trying to finish this paper on Alessandro and the Beggar's Opera until 7 am, where I went to bed until 8 am, when I got up to go to my 8:30am class where we pass this in and have a debate about it. The weird thing is, I am awesome at speaking in this tutorial, and I don't know if it's because it's a tiny group, or because of the subject, or because I'm too tired to be afraid of speaking so early in the morning. I don't know. But my debating was awesome, paper was terrible. I wish we had debated beforehand, because it really helped me organize my thoughts. Oh well, btw, my paper was written to you, Lauren, because it was supposed to be in letter form, and you like heroes and ancient history topics that are in opera seria.

In other subjects, I cannot speak in class at all, and writing things to be posted on discussion boards is even worse. I can't even think about webct without this shock of fear coming over me. I don't understand why i can be so calm in one class (well, that's a relative term), and completely immobilized by anxiety in the other. I spent a week fretting over my oral presentation for cognitive science with the very real fear that when I would have to speak, I wouldn't be able to say anything. Maybe it's because I was visibly shaking through the entire class period but I was left for last and in the end, didn't have time to present. So I had to post a written presentation on the discussion boards and that was even worse, maybe, because writing is permanent. So now my thing is there forever, and I'm going to have to do another one next week. so somehow, I need to figure out what it is about music history tutorial that is ok.

Probably because they're arts students, you don't have to be right, even ridiculous things are valid interpretations. Yet the people in this psyc class say the most ridiculous things, and don't understand anything, but that scares me, because what if I'm the one who is really not understanding? I don't even know. 

But the most disturbing thing has come to my attention and it is that I can know that something is completely true, see all of the evidence for it, and all of the evidence against the other, and I still believe something wrong. How can I know the truth and still believe the non-truth? I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never experienced it firsthand and it is the most disturbing thing ever. I feel like I am insane. Yet on the other hand, this completely explains how people are religious or believe in unicorns and such. But maybe not, because people say it's nice, but this is the opposite of comforting. It is not nice at all to be delusional. I know that you need the knowledge but also the feeling of knowing, and these are supposed to coincide, but they don't always, and it is highly disturbing when they do not.

Anyways, being sleep deprived is really strange. I haven't stayed up all night in so long I forgot what it was like. Well, I feel all tingly and shaky and nauseous, and like my eyes work but I can't really see anything. It's really not pleasant, and I need to sleep before the Gondoliers premieres tonight or I most definitely will not be able to play all those warp speed passages. Maybe real food would be good too, I had nutella and mozzarella last night for dinner ...

Reading week is coming at the right time I think. Might have been better next week but I can accept a week later.

my other thoughts: people in savoy are really attractive, well, but I think I have really strange taste, also our conductor is really awesome, also, you should watch the IT crowd because it's hilarious, and have I totally forgotten about anime? yes I have. I am always reminded of this because I'm in anime club"

"event","So I never posted about last semester, oh well, maybe I will eventually. but I should have because last semester was pretty cool, this semester ... ehhhhh Even though I possibly have a really awesome class, nothing can match psyc 410, really. But why am I not excited anyways? Because the most exciting thing ever is happening: Tallis fantasia

I meant to join the med students' orchestra in first year but was intimidated by their online application. But then I found out that they were playing the Tallis Fantasia in March and had to apply for audition. And as it turns out, I don't have to audition anyways. I went to a rehearsal and sat in, the conductor put me in the front of the seconds. This probably helped more than it was scary, actually, somehow this is one of the very few situations when anxiety improves my performance rather than demolishing it. Anyways so I played very well and the conductor told me I don't need an audition because I was awesome up front :D

And now I am in the process of fulfilling a life goal! I was not expecting this so soon!

Though ... I do kind of wish I was playing the first violin part. With the exception of one section, I prefer the first. Oh I wish I was playing the solo. more life goals

My awesome class this year will be cognitive science. My prof is this skinny Hungarian dude who's really intelligent. Also, only 30 people since it's 500 level. I know this dude is awesome because this is what he said:

philosophy student: ""What's the difference between this course and the philosophy equivalent?""
prof: ""In my class I only teach you things that are true.""

Music history prof is kind of scary. Also the syllabus is 5 pages long :/ and she wouldn't let me in the class, even though I'm supposed to be let in since it's a program requirement, but a space opened up. At least my TA is pretty nice.

Developmental psychopathology, list B course (all of the courses I don't want to take: health, developmental, and social psychology) but the prof is rather enthusiastic so it seems ok. I like her because she thinks people who think psychology isn't a science and people who think science isn't a valid method (or that it's some body of knowledge) are dumb. this was pretty much our first lecture. I love when professors rant about things. I don't actually have the prerequisites for this course, but I've heard abnormal psyc is bad here, and I don't care about developmental. Also, they keep explaining everything, and I enjoyed reading everything about abnormal in high school.

Our last lecture of that class, peer victimization, was like high/middle school flashback time! and more evidence MHS was really weird, apparently usually boys have physical fights, not girls? We had girls fighting pretty much every month. Also more evidence that Scandinavia is awesome, lowest peer victimization rates, I can't even imagine. I think the US was more than 10x higher o_o

and BBC SHERLOCK!"

"event","1. Hear Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis in concert.
2. Play Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis in concert.

If I can do these two things, my life will be complete. Technically I did the 2nd, but we didn't play the whole piece, so it doesn't count. Unfortunately, I don't see having another chance at playing the solo violin part ... damn, maybe I should be getting a performance degree. Of course, if I saw it in concert, I would probably want to see it again, so maybe my life wouldn't be complete.

I was just listening to this and having an experience.

So I feel music in my stomach flowing out to my extremities, head, and mouth, and I was wondering, where do you feel music?

-------

So besides that, I started classes, well, except I'm shuffling through courses. My add/drop period is usually very uneventful, actually, I think I haven't ever changed courses that I originally registered for. Now for whatever reason Japanese is conflicting with everything, both sections, and I really need to get on my music minor because I already have to take summer courses to finish in time. But I really want to keep taking Japanese, also I'm pretty sure I will forget most everything if I don't take it for a year (like how I forgot French and German.)

Other than that, my two psychology classes are really really awesome. Special Topics in Neuropsychology - my prof used to be a professional magician, now studies attention (the psychology behind magic,) wants you to learn the big picture instead of memorize this list of things, likes to know your name (and apparently random info like where you live?), and likes to make sexual references so you remember things. Also the TA reminds me of Allegretto.

Then there's Genes and Behaviour which is totally a combination of two things that I really love: genetics and psychology YES augh plus I miss all this biology. Plus today was all about mutations, which now my fandom infected mind keeps supplementing with, ""groovy!"" =_=' 

oh yes and I finally got my A in stats. And I finally passed chemistry, except not enough for a science major agh x_x This makes me sad. Chemistry is actually really cool, like really really awesome even, but I am forever scared of ever taking another chemistry course again.  The weird thing is that for some reason first year courses are really difficult but the higher level courses seem to get easier and easier. I would rather not ruin my gpa by taking piles of first year courses. I apparently have two choices left: the non-molecular bio course or physics 102. I think the choice there is pretty clear. But I'm really terrified of taking another first year course. I did so well the semester I wasn't taking any!

And wow I just came back from my music history class and wow. I'm having an academic culture shock, what is this non-science course? The way the students speak is even different. ""What is music?"" in all my other classes has been clearly defined on the slide. Here we have a little discussion and talk about how the Greeks thought about that and are left to ponder it ourselves. O_O oh man. 

Also, I can not handle my academic advisor. Every time I go there I have this very unsettled feeling for the rest of the day. I think it's because she tries to be very comforting, but I don't think I like to be comforted very much, not by authority figures at least. So it is very awkward, then I can't remember my questions because I'm feeling anxious. Also then I can't help remembering that study about telling sick people that you will pray for them. Yes, comforting definitely makes me feel worse, I think this is also why I feel weird comforting other people because I really dislike being comforted myself. No, I come to you because I actually want to know what to do next!

"event","So I am now back in montreal, the rest of nova scotia was pretty awesome. 

went to cafe and jammed with countryish musicians! it was really awesome!

sailed to an island towing the whaler, holding the stays and pretending to fly. Then we backwinded the jib while trying to tack and the boat went sideways and I almost fell off, my legs were hanging in the water, and my hand got cut up by the stays. 4 lines across my fingers and palm. Then we got to the island and had an adventure trying to anchor the boat because the anchor wasn't heavy enough. I took a bath in the ocean!

Then we had a lobster cookout. yum :)

did some more jamming and gave some concerts of improv. We might have a band name, possibly A Minor Wave (1st cd - A Relatively Minor Wave)

Oh and we finally got wine and drank it on the boat, with pipes. The water was really creepy and still.

Then we drove back into and through the hurricane! exciting! it was pretty crazy. water everywhere, rain, wind shaking the car. OH yeah but before that we went to peggy's cove, which really looks like Ireland, there was also a bagpiper playing scottish tunes.


~~~ and now I have some things for lauren:

"event","So i am in the internet cafe again! Today we went out on the boat and it was pretty awesome. There was lots of wind and splashing waves as we all laid on the deck. This morning we went swimming and had delicious breakfast and the best banana bread ever. mmm goat cheese banana red pepper omelet, orange raisin toast, and chai.

Last night it was really clear and we could see the milky way, so we went stargazing in the whaler. Then we accidentally drove onto a sand shoal. ahaha But earlier we sailed the bluenose. very exciting

Now there might be a hurricane!



Oh lauren, so apparently the crossdressing scene is now online? In the japanese trailer! look it up.


Ooh and I went to a laundromat which I have not been to since I was like 4. It was an adventure!"

"event","SO I am in nova scotia right now, in a free wifi zone, and we're living on a sailboat! in the ocean! with two dogs and two guitars and a violin. It's pretty awesome. 

The drive was like 14 hours long and there's even a time difference of an hour. And overnight so I never actually slept because there was no room and dogs kept trying to sit on me. So far we've had one jam session on the boat. And we went to an island for breakfast but it was too wet to make a fire. Speaking of wet, it was pouring buckets of rain soon after we first got on the boat. Somewhere there's a hilarious picture of that. The water is actually not that cold though. We did go swimming in the rain.

But before that, otakuthon!

OMG. IT WAS AMAZING.

Mostly because of the amazing awesome panels. So I was on the train even before the con, reading the list of panels, and FIRST CLASS SLASH appeared. !!! Then I freaked out on the train. Then there were more, like FANDOM AND KINK by the same people. Who were really amazing and awesome, and we've read the same fics, since we obviously read the same kink meme and it was super awesome. And I got a charles/erik print and excitedly discussed how perfectly slashy the movie was, then apparently people I know also had a charles/erik summer of fandom explosion and also went to fandom and kink, so we had an OMG discussion outside that panel. There was also a bad fanfiction panel run by people we know with dramatic readings of My Immortal and the like. Then I never even watched/read any Sherlock Holmes before but I went to the panel anyways (because the first class / fandom kink people were running it and OH I was missing out, so I came out shipping things I have never seen before, well now I have seen the BBC version, which is pretty awesome, and has a delightful amount of subtext but of course I would like it because I do like these sorts of characters.

BUT LAUREN. You must watch the Korean BBC Sherlock trailer. it's hilarious. Clearly, they know their audience. OH GOD. Oh yeah also the jizz in my pants sherlock video is also hilarious.
Actually all over the convention, it was like ""where is lauren?!"" There were many things for you there. Except in the HP slash panel (also hilarious), that was a ""where is michaela?!"" hour.

There was also a hilarious yaoi that we watched part of, I think it was called Fake? about some police dudes, very stereotypical, including the ambiguously gendered shota, weird super flamboyant guy, scary dude that probably will rape the uke, protective jealous seme, not sure if want uke, and random girl hanging out with them totally supporting the seme/uke romance. As for the other screenings, some painfully bad yuri clearly made by people who have never even kissed someone because tongues do not do that! and wtf pops classical music during the sex scenes with really bad anatomy. Then there was a super cutesy one and then the alternative hentai screening of Bible Black which was mostly hilarious because it had the english voices. oh man. And tentacles of course.

Hmmmm I think I covered everything. Oh yeah! Lavender Ice was there! woo so I got a commission from her (of zahrah and scarfman this time) and this other 
person, whose friends I will apparently make happy since they have also been asking for charles/erik fanart from her .... >.>

First class slash was pretty awesome, we went through all of the charles/erik moments of the movie, talked about the possibilities of mutant sex and how people could get together after the movie ended, also showed the havoc/darwin moments (that I never knew existed), and showed some fanart. Then fandom and kink was about kinks and how they worked so well in some fandoms or for some characters, and kink memes and discovering new kinks, and they kept bringing up first class which was awesome (but yes it does have many kink possibilities.) Also some hilariously bad drawings on the white board trying to explain things. 

comparison: otakuthon vs anime boston
Anime boston is weird, because the US is weird, there is less gay, also fewer male crossplayers randomly
otakuthon: better panels, more awesome people, anime boston: more organized and obviously larger, better bands, better dance (or so I hear)

then in between, exams!!! !!! ahhgh. chem 120 round three, not sure. still did not finish in time, but at least I had fewer left than last time ... stats deferred exam, surprise! not multiple choice like the midterm, but actually I think I did fine anyways. stats is very easy. except I put far to many assumptions for one of them. oh well. I still got everything else right, but I'm never sure what or how much they want you to write on open answers. At least the good thing about supplemental and deferred exams is: fewer prowling exam invigilators! those guys freak me out far too much, and I can't write when someone is looking over my shoulder. So, nice."

"event","So yes as russian posted, we watched the movie that all the gifs were from to see that dancing outside the car scene and OH GOD fassbender, wtf. We just knew from the beginning where the girl was 15 that this was not going to be good. 

middle school girl "">.> <.<""

checking out ""suspicious""

taking off her pants ""no! no! don't do it! oh, ok, just tucking her in.""

girl creeping watching mom doing fassbender and secretly videotaping ""ok, slightly creepy, ok ...""

fassbender carries her around and stuff ""yeah, he's good with kids, yes.""

leans in to kiss ""DON'T DO IT!""

sex scene ""NOOOOOOOOO""

Then tried to replace that image with band of brothers, but that was as bad as it was in gibonbon's class. Also he wasn't even in the half of the episode we watched.

Should have stopped at the car scene. there wasn't even an ending of the movie. Oh yeah she kidnaps his child and pees on his floor, then runs away to Cardiff!

ANYWAYS what I came to post was this hilariously awesome link for russian:

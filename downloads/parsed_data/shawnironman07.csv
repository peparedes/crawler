"event","<font size=""3"">Well, being a single parent of three and training on your own for an ironman is a challenge in itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Man, kids can drive you crazy!<br /><br />Finally, onto some training!&nbsp; This morning I headed out around 5:15AM to the gym to do my scheduled run.&nbsp; The ride on the bike was cold as!&nbsp; Normally on Wednesday I do a ride in the morning and a run in the evening but due to weather as of late (rain), I've decided to swap them around.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you ever tried to source a treadmill at the gym with 20 minute time slots?&nbsp; Well, my gym doesn't allow people to book multiple slots on the same treadmill; what they do allow is that you book multiple treadmills.&nbsp; Now how silly is that, you're using a resource whether you move from one treadmill or stay on the same one.&nbsp; So, here is my trick - but I'm sure they've caught on and just let me get away with it now....&nbsp; What I do is put all my kids names in each time slot, so, I get a total of 120 minutes in one round.&nbsp; Whoo hoo!<br /><br />Tonight I arrived home at around 6:30PM and did the normal parental duties - cooking, uniform washing, yelling at the kids, getting them to do their chores, and etc.&nbsp; After all was well, I headed upstairs to setup for the wind trainer.&nbsp; Normally I like to listen to music or watch a movie while riding; tonight I decided to watch some TV.&nbsp; Helpful hint, always keep a remote in your back shirt pocket, powerbar, and water.&nbsp; So, I was watching Cops and then a movie ""The Terminal"" came on.&nbsp; Another helpful hint is to have two wireless computers, I used a normal computer up front while training and I use a cheapo on my back wheel for the wind trainer; this basically helps me know how far I've traveled and my average.&nbsp; Now, to go with this, you need a training program.&nbsp; Normal stuff is like a 15 minute warm-up at high revs and then get into it.&nbsp; My training was something like 15 minute warm-up, 15 flat, 15 hill, 30 flat, 30 hill, 5 sprint, 5 up, 5 down, 5 sprint, 5 up, 5 down, and finally 15 minute warm down.&nbsp; How, 5 up means out of the seat while 5 down means five minutes on the seat grinding it at the hardest.&nbsp; Well, it was now 11:30 PM, headed to the shower for a nice hot shower - make sure you stretch in the shower - awesome for stretching and music density - relaxation of muscles.<br /><br />Good Night</font>"

"event","<font color=""#ff6600""><font size=""3"">This December I'll be on my way to doing my first ironman; this past May was my first Half-Ironman - Busselton Half Ironman.&nbsp; This race was difficult and challenging given that five weeks before the race I had a slipped disc l5 s1;&nbsp; My running suffered but I did manage to record a 5hr and 30 minute.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've decided I'm going to write a book on the events of my first year and all the tips and tricks I've learned along the way - I've decided on the title of the book to be ""6 words of an Ironman"".<br /><br />Like most of you I have started my training and have slacked and reorganized as well.  My Journey hasn't just started but I thought this would be a good source in documenting all my daily training, up's, down's, tricks, and tips.<br /><br />My next race is in Singapore for the Ironman http://www.ironman703singapore.com/   This race will give me a true gauge on my conditioning and strength, as well as my weaknesses.  <br /><br />Hope you guys enjoy my blog, give me some feedback (love) and any suggestions along the way!<br /><br />Shawn</font></font>"

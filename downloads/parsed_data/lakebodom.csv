"event","<p align=""justify"">Alright, time for a new post. In this post, I have a base of Dani Filth, bases of Dimmu Borgir, a random banner of Angela Gossow of Arch Enemy, and some Harry Potter stuff. These banners have text on them, but it's not specific as to what it has to be used for.. so you can use them for basically anything you want.

"event","<p align=""justify"">Welcome to the new graphics journal for <lj user=""shinku"">. The old icon journal didn't seem to fit me anymore, and so I have created a new one. In fact, I rarely even updated it anymore, and I am determined to update this one more often. For now, it shall remain public. Anyone can friend it, but the very first time I catch someone using my things without credit, then it shall instantly go friends only! So be careful, and please use respect when taking my work.

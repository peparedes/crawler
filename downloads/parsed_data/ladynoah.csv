"event","What else could bring me to post but the news that there's finally going to be some balance in the government?  It's been such a long imprisonment under the reactionary right-wing rule, I can literally feel some weight lift off of my shoulders.  Can sanity actually be close at hand?  Can I finally hope to see things coming out of Washington that doesn't embarass me as an American?  Goddess, please let it be so.  One of the most thankful events?  Rumsfield stepped down.  The man responsible for thousands of American deaths - the man responsible for thousands of Iraqi deaths........is gone.  Years late, but I'll take the victory for what it's worth.

Of course, the morons of the State of Texas re-elected Perry...but I'll take the small hit here at home in light of the nationwide blessings.  A million thanks to all who voted to bring these events to be."

"event","I've been reading with interest the comments on <lj user=""telaryn"">'s journal entry regarding religion in today's society and the assumption of anyone outside of Abrahamic faiths being labeled ""nonreligious"".  Considering the current White House administration and it's obvious influence by and preference for Christianity, I don't think it's surprising that the mood of our country has continued to swing towards the ""us versus them"" mentality.  Turn on any tv, listen to any radio, read a column or a book, and the ""it"" thing today in the political world is to wear your religion like a badge of honor.  Every aspect of American life today and the rights that we were granted have become religious fodder:  the abortion debate, gay marriage, privacy issues, even the war currently being waged in Iraq have become innundated by terms like Biblical, moral, Divine punishment, and Godless.  Was this always there?  Or did it begin to insiduously creep across our country like a poison weed when Bush took office?  

I don't remember religion growing up.  We moved from post to post and life simply was people and places, not churches and religious mantles.  I don't know what religion our neighbors were - I didn't care.  They were just there, good and bad, living and working and being.  After reading the original entry and considering my own memories, I brought it up to my mom, thinking that perhaps it had been a child's blindness to the adult world that explained my lack of knowledge.  But, like me, Mom had no recollection of anyone's religion, except those who were close friends of theirs.  So when did it become acceptable to question someone on their religious beliefs?  When did it become normal for us to recite what church we attend and what God we believe in?

Personally, I have no religious belief, no Divine being that I worship.  I've explored many and found myself fascinated by each, with their complexities and rituals, their understanding and vision of the Divine: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Paganism, and more.  Each so beautiful and diverse, like beautiful quilts with each square containing a pattern that it would take a lifetime and more to explore.  But I don't identify with any and I don't know if I ever will.  Perhaps I haven't learned enough, opened myself enough, to let one immerse me in it's mysteries and capture my heart and spirit.  And despite the current societal beliefs, that doesn't bother me one bit.  As I grow older, I find that in my mind, one of my most valuable rights is the right to have, or not have, a religious belief.  It is a decision that is made with a person's mind, and heart, and soul, and that makes it infinitely precious."

"event","So, I once again fell behind on updating this sucker.  I refuse to feel badly about it anymore.  I just have no desire to put out anything that's going on in my life lately.  Work seriously sucks, and it's depressing as hell - maybe that's why I've been feeling so blah lately.  Satisfaction at work really can influence how your life, and you, feel.  Let's just hope that it gets better soon.

The one bright spot in the last couple of months was the short family vacation we took last weekend to Albuquerque.  It was wonderful - no family, no one we know, just me, the Cop, and the Angel.  We visited the zoo (twice, we're all animal freaks), the aquarium, the Natural History Museum, and Old Town.  We woke up Sunday to find about an inch and a half of snow on the ground, which sent the Angel into ecstacy.  Living in the desert, we don't get to see the white stuff very often, so I think that was the highlight of the trip for the little one.  He had me out in our hotel courtyard at 7:00 a.m. in my pajamas while he ran wild and pitched snowballs at anything and everything - including his poor mother.

We bought a couple of things that caught our eye:  a handmade wall tile for Dia de los Muertos, with two skeletons playing cards, a small brass statue of Bast for me, and a gorgeous piece of Navajo sand art.  That one made my day, it was the only thing I promised myself I would finally buy.  I'm going to try to put a picture of it here, along with one of me and the Angel.  Ignore my hair by the way, the wind was a bitch.

Guess that's it for now.  I'm reading everyone's LJ's and Blogs, by the way, and know that I'm sending vibes, wishes, and whatever else is asked for even if I don't say anything.  Later!

"event","As usual, I was trying to figure out what to post about.  I had an uneventful day, so that's a no go.  Then I caught the last bit of a movie the Cop was watching about Flight 93 from September 11th.  I don't watch shows about 9/11 anymore - I overdosed when it happened, glued to the television like everyone else in the country.  I just can't take seeing it again.

I never thought I'd live to see what I call a truly ""historical event"".  I wasn't alive for the first astronauts or the walk on the moon; I wasn't here for JFK's assassignation or Vietnam; D-Day and Pearl Harbor are events that I read about but I don't have the memories of seeing them happen.  The Twin Towers and all the events of that day, though, they live in my mind and have taken root.

I can remember where I was when I heard the reports, about 30 minutes after it began: in my car, on the way to work.  I remember that nothing got done that day as we all huddled around the tvs set up on various floors of the Department, watching everything unfold like it was a bad dream. I cried alot that day, and the days that followed, and I still have a difficult time grasping what a huge impact seeing it all made on me.  I was amazed to see how this entire country became united in a way I had not experienced in my lifetime.

Maybe that's why I have such an emotional reaction to the things that have come out of that terrible day.  The slow deterioration of our rights and liberties, the casual acceptance of harrasment and imprisonment of so many Muslims in our country, the war in Iraq, and even the ridiculous spending by some of the survivors of 9/11 victims.  Our internal government and many of our own countrymen have done more to damage this country than the terrorists could have ever aspired to do.  It breaks my heart and makes me furious at the same time.

It will be a day and a time that I will talk about with my grandchildren someday.  And I know that, like my grandparents and parents before me, I will never be able to fully convey this time.  Words, and stories, and pictures can tell the tale - but sometimes only through living it can you truly understand.  I just hope that when I do tell my story, I'm able to talk about it all in the past tense.  I want what I tell them to be incomprehensible, not something that they are living with.  That, in my mind, would make the whole tragedy something I can live with."

"event","I may be in the right frame of mind to discuss my sister-in-law
tonight. Though, if I notice I'm deteriorating into lengthy,
nonsensical ramblings punctuated by curse words, I'm going to cut the
post short. That's not out of the realm of possibility, believe me.
I love her, I really do, but she is one of the most selfish, clueless,
and laziest women I have ever met. <br>
<br>
Since I met her (which was 13 years ago) she has never held a job. She
lives in my mother-in-law's house. My mother-in-law pays most of the
bills. And she has sworn up and down that once the littlest of her
brood began school she would find a job to ""help out"". Well, R is in
school and sis-in-law is now finding every excuse in the book why she
can't even <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">look </span>for a job, let alone get one.  

<br>
<br>
Part of the blame I know belongs to my MIL. She has never forced the
issue, she has never made demands. Until now. Unfortunately, now is a
little too late. SIL is set in her ways, and damned if she's going to
change. I can understand MIL's instincts to help her daughter, and even
more to make sure her grandchildren are well taken care of. But the
woman is 65 years old and should be retired and enjoying her life.
Instead, she's back working with CPS, 6 days a week, and busting her
ass to make the money she needs to support so many people. My FIL is
pissed, and is getting to the point that even hearing SIL's name makes
him start cursing up a storm. And he's the most laid-back, easygoing
man I've ever met. I think he hit the breaking point when SIL called
the house last Saturday morning and, on hearing my MIL was at work,
said an offhand ""Poor lady."" and promptly hung up. Completely clueless,
I tell you.
<br>
<br>
I and the Cop hit our limit when one of the Cop's counsins called and
said SIL had been asking him for money all day to pay the Electric
Bill. Keep in mind, this is 3 weeks after the bill is due. She says MIL
told her ""Tough shit"" and she needs the money. So, I go up to MIL's
office so she can talk to the Cop. Turns out, SIL called MIL that
morning and said that the electricity had been turned off, her new
boyfriend was going to pay with a check, but they wouldn't take a
check. MIL tells her to have the boyfriend cash the check, and problem
solved. This was first thing in the a.m. SIL then calls MIL at 4:00 in
the afternoon to say she needs the money. MIL indeed tells her too bad,
she's at work, can't leave until 5:00, what the hell is she supposed to
do about it? A bit different than SIL's ""poor, poor, pitiful me"" story
to the cousin. MIL was so upset to hear what SIL was doing that she was
almost in tears. Add in that we find out from 2nd SIL that 1st SIL had
a damn <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">party </span>3 days before that phone call, and that was enough for the Cop and I.

<br>
<br>
How do you deal with someone like this? It's not like we can cut ties.
She's family, she's the somewhat mother to our nieces and nephews. But
she lies so much and causes such stress in the family I'd like to kick
her ass. That's not really conductive to tranquil family relations.
She's 43 years old and seems convinced that everyone owes her something
because she was able to spread her legs so many more times than the
rest of us.&nbsp; Hmm, did I mention she had 13 children?&nbsp; And
that if she doesn't get what she thinks she deserves she doesn't let
the kids come visit any of us?&nbsp; That's our punishment.<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp; </span>So how do you untangle those family ties without giving them enough time to eventually choke the life out of you?"

"event","So, since I have been shamelessly requesting book recommendations, I thought it might be a good idea to post up what I already have in my little, tiny library.  I did some scouting last year when I started stepping away from the RC and hit all the used bookstores for books that caught my eye.  I think I read 2 of them and then wandered away from it when the imbeded RC guilt caught me in a stranglehold.  Luckily, I didn't feel guilty enough to get rid of them (perish the thought!) and maybe they'll be worth a look.  So, my current list:

1.  Drawing Down the Moon - Margot Adler
2.  Witchcraft From the Inside - Raymond Buckland
3.  The God of the Witches - Margaret A. Murray
4.  Wicca - Vivianne Crowley
5.  Keepers of the Flame - Morganna Davies and Aradia Lynch
6.  Spiral Dance - Starhawk
7.  Maiden, Mother, Crone - D.J. Conway
8.  Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner - Scott Cunningham

The two I got through were Witchcraft from the Inside and Keepers of the Flame, which I really enjoyed.  But, like I mentioned before, most, if not all, focus on Wicca.  I really, really want more general Paganism, and I'll definitely look up Hutton (thanks, Sarff!).  But I can always use more... :::shameless hinting:::"

You wouldn't believe how long it took me to make just those few adjustments to this sucker.&nbsp; I have <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">got </span>to
spend some time online learning how to do this stuff.&nbsp; Everyone
makes it look so easy and it's sooooo not.&nbsp; I'm not even going to

on and on and on.&nbsp; I'll get there, it's just going to take me

You'll notice I haven't been updating like I'm supposed to ::slaps own

nothing exciting going on, but that's the way I like it.&nbsp; I did
spend a good amount of time going through Barnes and Nobles to figure
out where to spend my Christmas giftcard.&nbsp; I did get the book
suggested by Laura ::waves:: and then bought a couple of general books
on Paganism.&nbsp; I've given up on trying to fit myself into
Catholicism, and since I've been drawn towards Pagan paths, I'm going
to do some serious reading.&nbsp; I'm also going to spend some time
concentrating on myself and letting my guilt over cutting myself off
from the RC go.&nbsp; Maybe then I'll be able to hear Someone else
calling me.&nbsp; We'll see.<br>
<br>
In other news, my sister-in-law is a worthless bitch.&nbsp; I've got
plenty to say on that subject, but I don't feel like getting into it
tonight.&nbsp; Maybe later - it's better if I don't go to sleep with
that subject on my mind.&nbsp; Night!<br>

Man, I need to go spend my B&N gift card!!  Just 3 more days and I'll have some new, glorious books."

"event","Back to work I went.  The Cop and I played alarm clock ring-around-the-rosie this morning for 30 minutes before we finally hauled ourselves out of bed.  The Angel (who was wandering the halls at 12:30 last night) took some coaxing, but woke up fairly well, considering our wake-up time was around 10 a.m. the last 3 weeks.

I met my new boss this morning, something I've been ambivilant about.  I've been doing her position as well as my own for over 4 years, yet didn't rate an interview when the position came open.  You could have found my picture in the dictionary under ""motherfuckingpissed"" in December because of that little maneuver, but I've moved past it and into the ""what-the-hell-it-means-less-work-for-me"" stage.

She's very nice, and seems very competent and eager to help out however she can.  I could use the help, without a doubt, but it'll always grate a bit.  Added to that our Regional Director and the Higher Ups want her to shadow me until April, so she can learn her new position.  Can you hear my eyes rolling out of my head at that one?  Yeah.  

The one surprise was the rave reviews I've evidently gotten from all the Higher Ups and caseworkers - color me astonished.  Most of the time all I hear are the complaints, so I appreciate the compliments, even if they are secondhand.  I'll take what I can get.

All in all, not a bad start back.  Now, I just have to get back into the swing."

"event","We had a great time last night.  There were 7 of us playing poker all night, finally breaking up at 5:30 this morning.  Gah.  By the time we picked up and went to sleep it was just after 6 a.m.  We started playing around 10 p.m. with the $10 buy-in and at cash out time we were only out about $3, so not bad for a nights entertainment.

Unfortunately, I woke up feeling like hell this afternoon.  Considering I didn't drink that much I'm rather ticked.  The Cop gave me some asprin before he left to pick up the Angel, and a nap and a shower helped some.  My sinuses are going nuts and my throat is sore, so I'm guessing I've managed to pick up something.  I've got to get back into the office tomorrow, so I'll take some Nyquil tonight and hope that knocks most of it out.

I'm definitely feeling the blahs (vacation ending letdown and this bug), so I'm going to cuddle up with some movies and zone out for my last day of freedom.  Later!"

"event","We've restarted our normal routine today.  The Angel went back to Catechism this morning, which we were about 6 minutes late for, and I think Monday is going to be a horror.  None of us are used to getting up early anymore and having to be back on a time schedule is a bitch.

I admit I'm getting annoyed with having to get up on my Saturdays to take the boy to the Church.  Considering I've basically dropped all Catholic beliefs that I once held, I feel a bit hypocritical having him attend.  But, he enjoys it, he has an amazing faith in God, and I use that to comfort myself with him learning a belief that I want no part in.  Plus, it's generated some great discussions between us regarding other faiths (my deepest appreciation, RI Ladies) and I think it's giving him a more balanced view of religion.  

It's a bit disconcerting to tell him about other Gods/Goddesses/beliefs and have him accept what I say without a qualm.  I'm so glad that he trusts me that much, but it's given me a greater understanding of how children can get so completely screwed up by their parents' beliefs.  I just hope that I'm leading him in the right direction.  I think I am:  he considers school supported prayer ""stupid"" and calls Bush ""that idiot"".  ::snort::  I just want him to keep asking for more information when he hears things, rather than accepting that first idea as the whole picture.

Anyway, we've got a card party tonight - $10.00 buy in which usually lasts us for 5 hours or so.  I'll have a house full of people, a ton of booze, and non-stop laughter.  I'm really looking forward to it - I even cleaned my house!  Speaking of which, it's time to start getting ready.  Later!"

"event","Question:  How the hell does everyone think of something to write everyday?  I get online a couple of times a day to check in on all my favorites, and I'm lucky enough that no one lets me down.  Day in and day out, I can find posts to laugh at, cry over, ponder, or enjoy - I take it for granted, I know.  Everytime I log in, I tell myself I'm going to write something and yet I rarely do.  I can't think of anything interesting enough to put in here!  I feel like I'm taking without giving back, and that's really beginning to bother me.  So, my ONLY new year's resolution will be to post an entry when I come online.  Even if it's just a one-line wonder.  I still have to work out the logistics of whether it'll be here or on my Blog, but I'll worry about that later.

I'm on the last days of my 3 week vacation and for the first time, I'm going to return to work feeling like I actually accomplished something.  The house is almost recovered from Christmas (the interior is done but the outside isn't - the Cops domain, Lady don't do heights), I've finished most of the inside projects I was aiming for, and tomorrow I'll finish the garage.  I'm so sick of all the STUFF in my house - it was taking over and I'm determined to have some space back.

My house, despite my boys, has been lonely lately.  Two days before Christmas my baby, Licorice, my 1 year old cat, got out of the house and disappeared.  We spent over 4 hours that night looking for her and despite calls to Animal Control and signs in the neighborhood, we haven't found her.  We know someone has her, she's an indoor cat and the one other time she got out we found her in the backyard with the dogs.  If she'd been picked up by Animal Control she's microchiped with our information and we'd have been contacted.  I'm sick about it.  Despite the fact we got her and her sister (who died at only 4 months old) for the Angel, Licorice was mine.  She followed me around the house, she came to find me when she was hungry, and she slept on my head - I'm still having a hard time sleeping without that weight on me.  I just hope that whoever has her is taking good care of her.  Everyone keeps asking if I'm getting another cat, but I just can't think about it yet.  I'm still waiting to have her come home - a hopeless wish, maybe, but I can't bring another cat in here yet.  I still have her food dish full and I started to wash her window bed, but I couldn't do it.

To occupy myself, I'm teaching myself to crochet.  Strangely enough, I'm really enjoying it.  I've got many of the basic stitches down, so I'm making the Angel a small throw.  Wine colored chenille yarn with black chenille tril between each panel and bordering the edges.  I've got about a 1/4 of it finished and it's not bad.  I'm screwing up a bit on the counting (who can keep track of that!?) but not enough to be hugely noticable.  That's why I gave the Angel first choice - he won't be picky.  Maybe by the time I'm finished I'll have a way to post a pic.

Hmm, I had more to say than I thought.  Guess that's it for today, I'm going to hit the sheets.  Night!"

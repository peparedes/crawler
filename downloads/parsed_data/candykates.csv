I hate.... running out of weed

I never want to ... be lonely

I think the current President is ... a complete fool

My past is full of incredible... amazing memories and hard times

I get annoyed when... people are inconsiderate

Parties are for... blowing off steam and getting crazy!

I love it when someone... is happy to see me

I wish... i made more money

My most embarassing moment was... bleh

My fantasy is ... winning a mega lotto

..lets go to the punk rock show..

dropkick murphy's show last thursday night was awesome. i had a great time getting wastered with louie, stacy and barry. the first few bands were boring us so we basically lived at the bar. the band just before dropkicks was pretty good, i enjoyed them, and i loved their singer- he reminded me of timmy. he was bouncing around and jumping all over, totally energetic and i could tell he loved what he did, like timmy - plus, he was wearing camo pants... :)

anyways, when dropkicks came on the place was jumpin. i was getting tossed around down front like a ragdoll. ah, memories of my teenage years. im all bruised up! i think i took an elbow to the nose too, but i was so wasted i didnt notice how banged up i was till the next morning! i was really happy they played barroom heros. i love that song! after their set, louie and i went backstage and i got to meet al and the rest of the band. louie is friends with al from way back in the day (before he was in dropkicks) and he was really surprised to see louie cause he hasnt seen or heard from him in years. that was fun. and we got free beer. woot! 



 1 more day of work.
then its thanksgiving, new england stylee

:D

i am super excited.

we get to stay at louie's mom & sister's house in kittery, maine. louie's mom makes the *best* stuffing. i cant wait to stuff my face with yummy food. then relax on the couch with my new book, some movies, and a slice of pumpkin pie.

i am so looking forward to relaxation. sometimes its everything to be doing nothing."

(!) we made smores. yuMM! the J4U crew DJs rocked the hell out of that apple orchard! what great munchie food - apples, as far as the eye can see. i had one, it was delicious! jill's parent's land is awesome. very fun night.

as im coming back to theater 10 from the restroom, i notice a security guard standing there. so i hold my stub out slightly to indicate that i did indeed purchase my ticket and am allowed to re-enter the theater. he stops me and demands my ID. im kinda high still from the weed i smoked a while before we got there, and i kinda laughed at him and stared at him with that, ""OMFG are you serious?"" look on my face. aparantly he didnt think i was that funny cause he yelled at me to stop laughing at him, show him some respect cause aparantly hes an ""officer of the law"" and to show him my ID. realizing that he was serious, i told him that my ID was in the car with my purse. (they dont allow oversized bags in the theater, so i usually keep my bag in the car as to avoid situations just like this, i forgot that louie had it my ID tho..urgh) so he tells me that he cant let me in the theater without proper ID and that i need to go to my car to get my ID. of course, louie has my keys too, and at that point i also realize that he is actually holding my ID as well. so im starting to get an attitude with him because, DUDE, im *22* years old, and i do NOT appreciate being treated like a juvinelle deliquent. i paid for this movie and louie was already in the theater. hes like, ""quick, whats your date of birth?"" 
i look at him and say, ""i was born on april 28th 1982. i am *22* years old!"" i then tell him that if he really wants to make this a huge deal, that he could escourt me into the theater, find louie and he would show him my ID. hes all, ""dont get an attitude with me!!"" i told him i couldnt believe he actually thought i was too young to see this movie. after a few words, he finally says its ok, that i can go in, and he actually tells me not to be irritated and not to get an attitude cause it was merely a COMPLIMENT that he thought i was so young.

went and applied for the daycare job (see entry below for more on that) then stopped by 712 to visit :) smoked a spliff and chatted with derk and barry and then ian came home from school and we chilled for a while between his classes.
hulla early bird tickets are already sold out, which is crazy... i dont care about the price, i just hope to get them cause i have a feeling this party (and all remaining hullas to follow) will sell out. this hulla is on louie's birthday so we have to go :)

i applied at a child care center called, ""care-a-lot child care"" and after completing the application and answering some questions, i got set up with a 9:30am interview/observation on friday:) this means i'll go in and chat with the director for about a half hour and then she'll place me in a classroom and observe how i interact and work with the children. this will be so easy. i can carry on a conversation about the topic of children with anyone for hours, and ive worked as a teacher in child care facilities before and i know exactly what to do in a classroom with kids... it'll be so much fun to be back in a school setting again, ive missed it. i really hope i get hired there, we really need the money... but more importantly, i need to *do* something with myself... and i know that working with kids again will make me a lot happier. :)"

"event","President Bush was visiting an elementary school. One of the classes was in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asked the president if he would like to lead the discussion on the word ""tragedy.""

So the illustrious leader asked the class for an example of a ""tragedy.""

One little boy stood up and offered, ""If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy."" ""No,"" said Bush, ""that would be an accident.""

A little girl raised her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""

""I'm afraid not."" explained the president. ""That's what we would call a great loss.""

The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Bush searched the room. ""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of
tragedy?""

Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand. In a quiet voice he said: ""If Air Force One carrying Mr. Bush was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" exclaimed Bush. ""That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?"" ""Well,"" says the boy, ""it has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either."""

our house is awesome, its huge and we have a backyard, front porch, basement (with beer a pong table!!) and an attic space that im thinking of converting into a chill out spot to sit and smoke in. 
louie's DJing is doing well; hes playing a party called, ""native, please!"" in buffalo this friday, so if youre in the area, come check it out, hes on at 11:00. its at the 658 bar. 
um what else... been hanging out with ian a lot lately, hes so amazing... we were just in PA for the weekend, i got to meet his family... his mom dyed my hair a dark auburn (I HAVE RED HAIR!!) for free casue she runs a beauty salon in their basement. 
we've been partying a lot... J4U's party, ""STOMP!"" was a blast... and we went to the GXF party for all the bday ravers a few weekends ago, which was an absolute drunken blast :) we missed hulla... which saddens me, but its ok, we'll catch the next one... and goodfellaz 2 year is very soon which will be epiC!

"event","ok. wow. i havent updated this journal in like, 2 months!!
lots going on.

louie and i are moving to rochester, NY in 5 days. YaY! we are giving up the trailer out here in NH and moving in with 2 of our guy friends in a house in ra-cha-cha ;) 
the reason for the move is simple. we travel to t-dOT sooooo much and its simply a hard trip. its 11+ hours of driving time, a lot of wear and tear on our cars, and very expensive (factoring in gas and lodging). 
also, rochester is where the scene is. on this side of the border anyways. with the just 4 you crew throwing hardcore parties on the off months of goodfellaz & hullabaloo, we have all 3 bases covered. and its only a 2.5 hour drive or a 2 hour ferry ride to toronto, so thats sooooo much better than 11+. 
louie is starting to get really good, and moving to where the scene is will do wonders for his DJing. he can do club nights in buffalo and do parties in rochester, buffalo and toronto.
also, rochester is half way between MI & NH so we can visit MI much more often AND come back to visit louie's family. its the perfect place for us at this moment. 
weve been really isolated out here, and we miss our friends. i hate leaving them after a party and only seeing them once every few months. now ill have them in town and only a small drive away.
and all you MI kids, i havent forgotten about you. i miss you guys too. sarah, this means you most of all cause i still need to meet your bundle of joy. i cant wait to come out there. i miss you. 
so yeah.
things are on the up & up :D"

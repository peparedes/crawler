"event","So it's been a while since I've been here. New job and all that life stuff kinda gettin in the way. So yeah. Back again feeling a little left behind. Almost all my mates are either getting married or in longterm relationships, having kids or the kids they hav are turning 1 and 2 years old. Some are even putting down deposit's on their first houses.All I do now is work I'm too tired to see me mates in my spare time... what little there is of it.I've almost forgotten what erin looks like its been that long since I've seen her. The more I struggle to make something of my life the more I seem to slip backwards.
I just cant win."

"event","For all those people in my life that cant use a phone and use the net to tell if I'm still alive or not this is jus a short message to say that Yes I am still kicking, it's just that the new job is a little full on so I dont get to surf the net as often. But if you'd like to talk to me you could always send me a text."

"event","Get a picture in your head of yourself now. Then try to think what you looked like as a child. Now think about how it is that you've come to where you are now in your life. We all make choices every day. Some good, some bad. But what drives us to make certain choices instead of others?
Simply put.Demons. We all have our own little demons, those little things that drive our lives ahead of us. Something we want but cant have or maybe someone. The only thing we can do is identify our demons and deal with them. There is no script for how to do this. Which to me suggests that life is just one huge joke but in the event that its not perhaps we should play by the rules for now. But a time will come when the rules can be broken and then the fun will start.

"event","The first day of the new month and I'm sad to say it starts off on a sad note for me. I've just learned that I am now the last member of a group of three mates that used to work together.
Both Nate and myself knew that Dion was unhappy with his life long before ""IT"" happened. But we were unable to do anything about it.As it turns out some people just don't want any help. So when we got the call telling us that he'd taken one too many drugs on the weekend and as a result died, we were not all that surprised.
And now I'm sad to say that my good friend Nate has gone to join Dion where ever that might be. It's a shame to think that a man who spends a large amount of his life working on cars will wind up dying behind the wheel of one.
And then there was one! What to do now?"

"event","So as it turns out people do really read some of the shit I write in here. So this leads me to believe that maybe I'd better take a little more care about what it is that comes out of my funny little head.
It's funny to think that even when your surrounded by close friends how so very alone you can still feel.When I was younger I never gave much thought as to just how powerful a hug froma friend can be.But then when you dont get them as often you start to miss them,it kinda goes down hill from there.
So to my friends who do read this""you know very well who you are"" thanks for the concern? Or maybe Sorry to cause you stress?I dunno. Life is all too hard just at presant."

"event","Oh well such is life.We spend a large part of our lives running around looking for something or someone.Just to give our crappy little lives some sort of meaning.But as it turns out only about half of us will ever find what it is that we are looking for.As for the rest of us we are doomed to walk this earth alone and unloved.Its a sad little life we live, but it's not like we have a choice.Sure one could look at it in the light that if worse comes to worse we can always end our own lives.But really when it comes down to it there's always something to stop us.Most of the time it is as simple as a small feeling of guilt about the people or ""friends"" we will leave behind."

"event","Now I will not pretend to know the first thing about computers. I can turn them on and off. that's about it really. So today after getting the shits with my computer and after hitting it once or twice,(cos' this always works on cars)I had to go out and do some work on a mates car just so I didnt feel so dumb. I like cars, if theres a problem you can pull it apart and find said problem and fix it. But bloody computers, pull one of these buggers apart and you run the risk of it never running again. So today when mine started to make a funny ticking noise I pulled it apart. I took one look inside,felt a sudden burst of dumb coming on and put it back together. I'm just hoping if I ignore it for long enough it'll go away."

Leaving behind only the broken shell of a pathetic creature who never tired hard enough, never gave enough or een cared enough. Mortality is a strange and puzzling thing to behold. The question should not be What is the meaning of life? But instead What is the meaning of my life? Simple....there is none."

"event","Jack of all trades, master of none.This has become a sad reality for me as apposed to just a clever saying.Life's constant struggle to find some meaning evades me no matter how hard I battle for it.There's something to be said about a person who has only death as a constant reminder of his humanity. As for me it is safe to say that even death is something that I will no doubt be no good at. The mind boggles at the thought of the cowardly acts I've performed in my life.All the missed oppertunities for the sake of fear of living.Is it possible for ones personality to melt away just as an ice cube does in the sun??"

"event","So here we are at 1am and yet again my day is just starting. The doctor did warn me that this altering of my sleeping patterns would be a bit of a head fuck but I had no idea how bad it would be. I'm really starting to miss day light.
Its strange to think that I'm the only person I know whos awake right now. Then again everyone I know has a job and or a life so I guess its not all that strange really. Still when you live outside the normal realm of humanity you get to see a whole new side to people you never knew was there."

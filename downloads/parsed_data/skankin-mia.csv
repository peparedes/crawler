"event","How did Camus really die that night?
Were they right?
When he died was it really his time?
Or was it suicide?


and I find, It gets harder every time

Back Off!

Hemingway never seemed to mind the banality of a normal life
and I find it, It gets harder every time
So he aimed the shotgun into the blue
Placed his face in between the two 
and sighed, ""Here's To Life!""

Hey there Salinger, What did you do?
Just when the world was looking at you
To write anything, that meant anything
You told us you were through

And it's been years since you passed away
but I see no plaque, and I see no grave.
And I can't help believing, you wanted it that way.


And I don't know much, but I do know this
With a golden heart, comes a rebel fist
But I can't help agreeing with those that would not quit.

And it makes me sick when I think of it
All my heroes could not live with this
and I hope you rest in peace 
Because with us, You never did!
And K.D.C., you were much too young!
And you changed my life!
But I draw the line at suicide!
Here's To Life!!"

nah ah, id do it again
the rascal king behind the bars
or the one in front of them

what we need now is love

We've had enough
We've had enough

Darling you can bet our moon is quite the opposite
So baby take a axe to your makeup kit
Set ablaze the billboards and their advertisements
Love with all your hearts and never forget
How good it feels to be alive
And strive for your desire
Just cause you can't see
Your cage doesn't mean that you are free
When there are laws against nature
But its ok for you to be
Addicted to over the counter prescriptions
And magazines dictate all our human relations
I'm not buying, no I'm not giving in
To a culture that objectifies all of our women
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming
The apathetic dribble on the news media's chin
I'm not buying, no I'm not giving in
The lies that are sold through textbooks to children
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming
Cause the positive will
Always overcome the negative right
And we stay inside, its right outside,
We stand in line
We all enjoy the fences to keep it at bay
But I'm not giving in

fuckin.... 7 months....i can do this
7 months and im fucking free

"event","so yesterday was a fuckin bust, got up at 7:20, rolled outta bed literally fuckin and just went to school....did math, made my stupid math stocking with the glitter and  the glue, mr. germans boowhack....2nd study hall slept with my headphones and listened to kellythegothgirl tell the preppy kids dead baby jokes....shes such a charachter.... 3rd and 4th slept in teh nurses, was in criminal justice for a bit but blancos like, Maria can you read? no! you cant! cuz your not paying attention! and i was like meh nurse? n shjes like ok sunshine girl....cuz i had my dreads in yesterday and i coincidentally wore a tye died shirt so I looked like quite the hippy....and thats funny cuz Dan's hippy name for me was like sunshine somethinorother.... but anyway then I had lunch, which I went to carvel...

Now, carvel opens at 11. It was 11:15. The girl who works there was just shootin the breeze and like not open. So I knocked, and she gave me the hand! and im like you did not just give me, the fucking consumer, the hand when you were supposed to be oipen 15 minutes ago. You didnt graduate high school, your 26 years old, and your working the morning shift at carvel. My friends your age are in grad school. Get the fuck over yourself! So I left, went back to the school, and bitched to chris and mr t about it. Im gonan fucking grind on the man! fuck you tom carvel! fuck you and your employees that have no work ethic! from now on im gona go to sip n soda. And it blows cuz I raelly really really want ice cream! But I'm on a diet and my mom announced this morning that I was not aloud to consume any sugar. Boy this christmas break is gonna be fun! 

Gym was actually okay, we played like dragon dag and pac man tag, and it was alot of fun. wow ok. Gym was fun. Moving on.....

Some bitchass girl ripped my Chorus test in half. The test consisted of me labeling note names, time signatures, and drawing treble and bass clefs. Mr T wants me to retake it. Now, I went to band camp for a summer, ive been playing since 4th grade, Im in jazz band, im a ska freak, and I took fucking music theory! I THINK I CAN READ MUSIC! its not fair that when someoen ripped my test I have to retake it. Becuase like some on the shits micky mouse, i DEFEINTLY know it and he KNOWS I know the shit....lol.....geez....cuz like I dont have time to go 10th and take it......boowhack! tara agrees with me! and if hannah w. were there m sure shed cause a stink about it lolololol 

So then I go home, and when I leave I accidentally backed up into Dani H's car cuz, well, I couldnt see the tiny thing! but luckly there was NO damage. I hope noone saw/remembers cuz I just dont wanna deal with the comments. Shit happens. Oh well! I told her that if ANYTHING what so ever was wrong with it to let me know and I'd pay for it. Just dont let my insurance company find out....lolol....

After I got home Geoff IM's me and hes like MIA LETS HANG OUT! So I was like OK! so...Geoff's this kid whos the straight male version of like tina kibler, only hes kinda cute. We went to the library lmfao and found books on penguins for this project I have to do for grillo....he was happy cuz He got stickers that said like wonderful reader or some shit.... then We sat in his car and he smoked and I was reading him the penguin books and like....I swear the penguins had subcultures....like there was one all by himself on a block of ice so he was Emo, he even had the hair! And there were like the hardcore penguins and the ska penguins in their suits.... but then I hadda go so I left, went to beths and she lent me some perfume so I didnt go home smelling like an ash tray.... went to go pick up snowball and snowstorm from the groomers, awww there so adorable, when my camera decides to stop pulling a MTA thing I'll take a pic....=) 

So then I go home and fell asleep till like 10, woke up and was fuckin CRANKY! bitched to like various people, but then I just layed in bed.....Steve called me and we talked till like 2 in the morning and then I fell asleep...i love that kid....and then this morning I was like BAAAHHHH NOT GOING TO SCHOOL!

and now here I am!

food? yes.

Love,

~!MiA

PS- Pray that steve's sister annie's gallbladder surgery goes well, I get ice cream at some point this week, voice of dissension gets to play that show at the donkey in march, my diet goes well, and that everyone has a safe, happy and warm christmas!"

"event","1) Yesterday I realized that I hadnt showered in like 3 days. Not cuz im gross or crusty or anything, it just happend.....wow it was actually more than that...cuz like ok I showered Wedensday, then Thursday I had the concert, Friday went to go get jim.....Saturday I finally showered. Yeah so like 3 days. So I felt GROSS so I was all yo <b>jim</b> I gotta get a shower I havent showered in 3 days, cuz he was screwin with me and I couldnt get in teh shower...and hes like GROSS DUDE and my <b>mom</b> goes ""yaeh, she does that"". 

2) I think I've become a little girly over the past couple weeks. I took a personality test online and it showed me how Vain I am...whatever haha its not my fault im rediculously good looking! Idk I'm on a diet now, but <b>Kris</b> informed me that I'm doing it all wrong, and hes a pharmacist so he'd know....apparently if I stop drinking I'm gonna loose mad weight, so <b>dave'll</b> be happy that I dont IM him anymore going DAVE I THIK YOUR SOOOOOO AWESOME! last nite my bro IM'd him and his away was I LOVE <b>AMANDA!</b> and my brother, not knowing what went on in the lives of dave and I, messages dave and goes my names not fucking amanda! and i was like JIM NO! so I felt bad about that...but I think hes not mad at me hahah at least I hope not! But yeah, I realized that I care way too much about matching and how my makeup looks and what earings to wear...IDK man! whatever. 

3) So on January 7th im seeing <b>The Vagabonds, World Inferno, Malibu Boy Scouts, Spider Nick, </b>and<b> Homecoming Queens</b>...and someone else that I'm forgetting....oh well! But its gonna be sick cuz I'm goin with<b> Jim, Joey and Steph</b>...and I'm gonna see <b>Dan, Jake</b>, and mad other people there! I love Jake, hes my little jew show buddy...hes like 15 from huntington, and one of the grooviest people ever! and his <b>girlfriends</b> going whos more band geeky than I am so I'm excited to get to meet her!  awwwww sophomore love..... 

4) <i>lately I've been hating people. I'm sick of the bullshit and I'm sick of the drama. I'm sick of people having to start shit for attention and becuase their lives are boring, and they need to make it intresting for themselves. they think there better than everyone else when in reality their ugly and spoiled and they suck. get over yourselves maaaan! seriously, were all drowned rats of the system, were all stuck here together, lets just try to play nice and get along. dont start shit and talk shit. its a waste of time and a waste of emotion. plus, you could loose an eye. or your heart.</i> 

5) <b>God</b> is fucking kick ass awesome. Love ya! 

6) I have a really big crush on someone that I like a real whole lot. His name's steve. I always thought he was cool, but lately, IDK, it was just like THUD! like! I dont know, were diffrent in so many ways.... <b>Steve</b>'s a pothead who's in a metal band called voice of dissension, he lives waaay in the 516, almost the 718, and idk, im straight edge and I want to start a christian ska band, and im from the hamptons. But like I don tknow, hes such a sweet kid....he loves his mommy and he belives in god, and hes just an all around nice guy. I think I trust him but I'm not sure. He wants to take me out for sushi...the only sushi I ever had was from King Kullen and it was Mad gross, but I'll try it again anyway! Hopefully were gonna hang out soon, I keep putting it off becuase....

7) I dont trust guys anymore so I'm mad nervous. Between <b>Caito</b> and Me and other girls I know, Im sick of guys telling us what we want to hear and end up hurting us in the end. So how do I know that this guy's not full of shit? becuase I want to trust so bad, I really do, but its just so hard for me. Like that one guy from this town east of me ive been talking to lately just totally screwed me over friday nite....he told me he did something with someone he swore not to do, and hes not in love with her, and as much as I hate the girl, that was wrong of him and shes gonna be really hurt in the end, and thats not cool. I dont care who you are, you dont hurt anyone. Its not nice. 

8) <b>Dave</b>'s birthday's coming up on Jan 10th, and then <b>Tom</b>'s on the 14th. Must get to hallmark......

17) Be honest, do you play the ""game"" when you are dating someone? dont hate the playa, hate the game! Whats the game? 

19) Do you believe love at first sight exists? Lust! thats all the story of romeo and juliet is! lust lust lust! they were blinded by their hormones and infatuation! 

20) Are you a romantic? I love romance 

21) If money wasn't an object, what would you do on your next date with someone you like? Go dancin at a show, and like IDK, get food, and then just chill out I guess.... 

22) Outdoor date or indoor? a little of both =) 

How important is..

23) Money? absolutely not important. He's just got to have a little money to be able to go do stuff with me, like grab dinner. But besides that, money doesn't count, he doesn't need to get me anything. Words are enough, just as long as they're not lies. (I agree with caito!) 

24) Physical attraction? it helps, ya know. i mean i'm not gonna lie, i'm a little shallow, but if hes fucking amazing its not gonna matter. but if he wants me to go out with him and hes a total ass AND hes ugly, im gonna be like hell no. If hes a really hot guy but hes a bit of a dick, I MIGHT go once just to see what happens. But all the hot guys ive been with end up being cocky self absorbed dicks. And if your ugly and a self absorbed dick...dude, get over yourself! 

25) Body type? Dosen't matter at all 

26) Brains? I have to be able to carry on a decent conversation with them obviously lol 

27) Animal lover? They dont have to LOVE animals but they have to be able to deal with Jeremy =)

28) Good sex? um....thats another thing. He's got to not want to go out with me for sex, cuz thats not the kind of relationship I'm looking for. But he's gotta be a good kisser. ;) ( i agree with cait. and what I'm about to say applies to me cait AND addie). We are fucking golden. were awesome girls. We three are the fucking cream of the crop. We're beautiful and special and awesome. If you think your gonna try to get with us to get ass, youve got another thing coming. youve got to EARN our love. If you use us, cheat on us, or hurt us in any other way, or force us to do things, you are going to get a huge fuckin slice of Pwncake. I'm not kidding. 

30) Race? WHOLELOTTA MULLATO! unity! it dosent matter at all. 

31) Do you believe that you can change someone? No. You are what you are and thats all that you are. =) 

32) If you could get married anywhere? I have no idea lol....

33) Sleep with friends? see #28

34) Do you easily give in when you are fighting? HECK NO! ask cait hahha.... RUN LIKE A BITCH!

"event","so yesterday was actually pretty swell, that guy's legit and hes nice and im not sure if hes full of shit or not but he seems like a genuinly nice person. the only thing is, i dont really want to be in anything serious right now. if i found someone mad special id totally go for it, but idk, hes not special enough to me to like, stick around. he was nice, and alot of fun, and i have no reason NOT to like him...however, there werent really any sparks. So I'm gonna tell him that...that i like him and hes a nice guy but I really dont want anything serious right now...girls just wanna have fun! i do like having someone tho...but hes gotta be special, ya know? but no worries, i know itll happen when its supposed to! hes probably right under my nose and I dont even realize it...isnt that the way it always is in the movies? 

""someday my prince will come""

but anyway, went with scavs paulie and newfriendcasey who is really fucking cool to mcdonalds, me and dom left them and went to ben's, where ben was in teh hot tub (rock out with your cock out? i dont know...lol)...annnnnnd then we had to go pick up sam from the macys parking lot, and after that we watched ella enchanted, bruce allmighty, and legally blonde.....that was fun! and I got in fights with dom becuase he took my keys so i had to get them back lol, and then he kept trying to tickle me, and as we all know i am mad violent when im tickled...so we got in like a fist fight which was fun.... um yeah, i guess thats about it, and then crazy driving in teh north sea/bridgehampton back roads, thats always a fab time! and then back to mcdonalds cuz thats what happend. I'm diggin that casey chick, shes mad chill, im gonna like find out her screen name and make friends! she dosent get along with girls at all but well see....lol...i need to make some more girl friends. 

ummmmmm I'm gonna write more later cuz my moms yellin at me lol...wish me the luck! i guess lol

oh! daves mad at me becuase of the whole drinking thing. he says ""ill never understand""...but whatever. Im not hurting anyone and im not really hurting myself all that much, so whatever. I think hes pissed becuase caito wants to now too but shes edge, and i dont know, its really not a big deal but i can see how it would upset him and how he sees its a big deal. I just wish he wasnt mad at me over that! its not really a problem, and its not anything anyone can change. and I do it like what, once a month? whatever...gotta get my kicks somehow. And I know its not good, but it makes me feel better. If im pissed off and I do it, I just forget everything thats bothering me and I just have fun and im fine....and I know thats not good....but damnit, what else am I supposed to do? who genuinly gives a shit when I'm in a bad mood? whos genuinly there for me? who can I always call no matter what time it is and tell whats wrong?

"event","so thursday night was jazz band, it was actually really swell...we sounded pretty good I must say, were definetly improving! we figured out where were going on the trip (DC and Virginia, ooo touring!) and were gonna play both places and go to some amusment park and not get enough sleep and eat too much crap and have the time of our lives BIOTCH! 

friday was crazy! woke up late, got a ride from Dave becuase it was too nasty out so I didnt wanna drive....well i WANTED to but my mom talked me out of it. did the school thing, then went to bridgehampton with amy and did some christmas shopping....I got for everyone cept my mom, no idea what to get her and I dont have any money so I have to figure shit out =\ after that we went to amy's, and I had mushroom pizza for the first time, it was from pauls...and I liked it alot! it was so good.... and then Ava picked us up and we went to max's house (turnbulls house! weird) and hung there for a bit, then went over to EH to see Rent...it was soo fucking good, it changed my life....you all need to see it! On the ride home this guy Dom called me...he got my number from steph scavs apparently, and I know him actually from greekfest 05...weird! its a small world. But anyway, were hanging out tonight...hopefully itll be good! were gonna go to bens and sams to my moms much...anti wanting us to go! and i might have to bring him back to bridgehampton but thats allright! should be good should be good

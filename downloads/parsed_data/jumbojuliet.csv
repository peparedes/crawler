"event","here is a copy of the email I sent to esther regarding my first 2 weeks in scotland!

DEAR ESTHER,
HI, PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO ALL OUR FRIENDS SINCE I CANT REMEMBER THE CORRECT SPELLING OF MOST OF THEIR SCREEN NAMES AS I AM VERY TIRED DUE TO LACK OF SLEEP/FOOD/WARM CLOTHING/SEX.

ALL THE MEN IN THIS DAMN COUNTRY ARE BASICALLY SHORT, DRUNK, AND IN SERIOUS NEED OF DENTAL CARE.  IT RAINS ALMOST EVERYDAY AND MY COSTUMES SMELL OF MOLD.  I HAD MY FIRST TASTE OF BOOZE (FIRST CIDER WITH SOMETHING MIXED IN IT, AND THEN WINE.... LOTS OF WINE) IT IS NO WONDER THAT YOU PEOPLE DRINK SO GODDAMN MUCH, GETTING TIPSY IS FUN FUN FUN..... I'M TERRIBLY HORNY SINCE I STARTED BIRTHCONTROL TO  REGULATE MY ESTRAGEN LEVEL, BUT I AM HARD PRESSED TO FIND A GENTLEMEN TO PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.  I HAVE 2 REALLY SWEET ROOMATES, BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS THEATRE GROUP ARE NEW YORKERS..(YUCK) AND I MISS MY CATS.  

THE DIRECTOR IS OFTEN AT TIMES LIKE A GAY MALE CARLA, HE MADE ME CRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET OUTSIDE THE LOCAL PUB AFTER HE SCREAMED AT ME BECAUSE HE FELT I USED THE BUS TOMUCH INSTEAD OF WALKING EVERYWHERE, WHICH WAS NONE OF HIS DAMN BUSINESS.  I'LL TELL YOU MORE LATER WHEN I GET BACK, BUT YET ME JUST SAY IF HE DIED AND WENT TO  HELL I WOULDNT MIND..


DINA, I MISS YOU A LOT, MEN IN KILTS ARE SOOO OVER RATED.
ALANNA, WELL, I MISS YOU TO, AND ESTHER AND TIFF AND NICO AND EVERYONE, BUT WHAT I MISS THE MOST IS 'I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER' AND FOOD THAT ISNT FRIED.  THEY HAVE DEEP FRIEND TWINKIES HERE!!!!! LOVE U LOTS,
P.S. IF U  DIDNT SEND ME AND ADDRESS TO SEND POSTCARDS TO, I AM EITHER NOT GOING TO SEND U ONE OR I AM GOING TO SEND IT TO ALANNA BYE"

"event","Hello,
I doubt any will ever read this other then Tiffany Bevins who made me create this livejournal.  I generally think that livejournals are retarded and don't like reading them, except to find out when one of my friends losses his/her virginity.

Anyhow,TWO DAYS TILL SCOTLAND!  DON'T KNOW ALL MY LINES FOR MACBETH! Will study tonight!

Cheerio,
Asmori"

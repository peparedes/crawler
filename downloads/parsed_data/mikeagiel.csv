"event","yesterday, wednesday, known as ""hump day"" in factory rat circles, saw rich and i writing a song, start to finish, in one evening. hours were 3:30 to 11:00. it is written in movements- the keys revolve around a pentagram of obtuse little-used's. it is formulaic yet formless. it is 7-8 minutes long, straight thru to a metronome at 130 bpm. D, Ab/G#, F#, Eb/D#, and B, a seemingly NEVER used key. next step is rote learning and vocalizations?"

"event","sifting through the dead- a timeless tale of murder, blasphemy, and, of course, categorization. so many unknowns. does a chainsaw-induced death earn you a spot at the ""stabwound"" table, or the ""bled out"" table? does one distiguish by color (blue gray drownings vs tar black immolated ones...) does all this talk of death and de-appetizing colors mean something? by odin's beard, of course it does! categorization. putting ""its"" where they go, putting things with like things. all objects are objects, and as such, go well together, but its sometimes easier to put them in piles. ideas go in stacks of smoke, objects go in heaps of ash. 
trying to group things together, make them GO. blst thm t f hr. ngsk blst thm th fck t f hr. in the background, hansi yells ""its my last sunrise, in fear. dont wait for me on the other side."" its as if no one sees anything. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . its as if everyone hears nothing. 
blackroof country, no gold pavements, restless deisels, silver horses, tired starlings."

"event","Hellish greetings, my foul endangered compatriots/komraden. heil unit blastenkruxen. tomorrow, the next day, is friday. this is, quite obviously, my first post. Primacy. I only got a live journal because JAMES doesnt allow anonymous posting. smart move and check-mate, you sneaky goader. so this is to be the diagram of those idea-zygotes i vomit out at random? what now? who is this now? excuse me? 
whoever is reading this only thinks they want a peek into my brain. oh boy, oh bot. robot."

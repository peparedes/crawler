"event","I haven't been looking at this thing in a while, I've been soooo busy with work, and a bunch of new people have shown up! Hi new people! Hi other people I've already met but haven't been paying enough attention to! Hi Kei, sorry about spilling the cereal <i>again</i>, I'll clean it up when I get off work!

I thought of my room at the hotel as home, then got pissed off at myself and blew up something in the park. I'm fairly sure it was a tree, there'd be bits left over if it had been a person or animal. I <i>will</i> get back to Garden.

I have a day off tomorrow, anyone wanna hang out? :D Ooh, or does anyone wanna spar? Preferably someone who can use magic!"

"event","I have never, ever seen or heard of a monster like the one Kei was talking about last night. I don't know to be worried that I've never heard of it, or excited that I might finally have a chance to kill something. I haven't seen any of the black things though, but hopefully they'll come back! Huh, I guess I'm just excited after all.

I had a super mega busy day yesterday at work, running around town and being late and then meeting Gaara and having to buy new clothes and then going to Obscuro! It was really tiring, but the good kind of tiring. I saw Demyx, and I met a guy named Lloyd and one of Demyx's friends, Larxene. Hopefully I'll get to see Demyx again today. Everyone should go watch him perform, he's really good!

Today is due to be slow at work. It'll be busy again tomorrow during auditions, then I get a day off while they decide who gets hired, then it should be a regular schedule from there on. My boss Ben reminds me a little of Sir Laguna, in the way he's good at taking charge but he's super nice about everything. I probably shouldn't think about him though, it'll just make me more homesick and I still haven't figured a way out...

I wish I at least saw more of Squall, but he's just... I never see him, not since I had him help me go job-hunting. Knowing he's here was a huge comfort at first, a sense of security, but... I've never had to be on my own, never. I don't remember it, but Edea says that I was placed in Trabia Garden when it was established, and they hung around long enough to make sure I'd do alright. It's weird having to start from scratch. 

I'll miss a few people when I'm gone, but I want to go <i>home</i>."

"event","Things I wish Faciatta had:

- My friends (more of them, anyway)
- Some kind of brochure for newcomers. Maybe with some lists. ""Been kidnapped and dragged to a strange place? Have no idea what to do next? Here are ten things to get you started!""
- A festival!
- A tournament, but I'm totally going to get started on fixing that if I can't get out/once I settle in.
- A training center. With grats and T-rexaurs and <i>everything</i>.
- Rocket launchers. Everything's better with rocket launchers!
- A train, just because.

In other news, I GOT A JOB!!! Hooray for me!! I was over by the Falsais Theatre because I was sick of looking for a job I might like and I felt like seeing what they were doing, and I went inside and heard this huge commotion. Turns out their stage manager went crazy or something, so I told them that if they didn't mind training me a bit, I could do it! They were so relieved to have someone that they said yes right away, sent the currently rehearsing actors home for the day (they apparently have several groups of actors so that they can have some people performing a play and some people rehearsing for the next at the same time), and told me to come in tomorrow. 

So no more looking for a job for me! I'm going to Regal Bistro to get something yummy and celebrate."

"event","Still haven't found a job. I mean, I think I could if I really wanted to, a lot of the chain stores and things are hiring, but... I want to do something special. There's no point in having a job unless I get a chance to use my talents. The problem is, my talents pretty much run down to kicking ass, organizing the Garden Festival, and some decent computer skills. Not much call for that here, as far as I can see. And I don't really have too much money because even though my rank and pay skyrocketed after the whole sorceress mess was over, I'd been sending most of it to Trabia. I just really hope I can find a job I like before my preservation instinct kicks its way past my pride and I end up waitressing somewhere.

<lj-cut text=""Private"">Private - I have <i>got</i> to stop talking so much. Being nervous about being in a new place is absolutely no excuse to go blabbering on to anyone who'll listen. The fact is that I have to accept that Squall is not going to take charge and save the day this time. He <i>likes</i> it here, and I have no right to ask him for anything major after all the crap he had to go through over the last year. 

Maybe it would help if I made actual friends, instead of just trying to learn everyone's names and introduce myself all over the place.

I miss Garden.</lj-cut>"

"event","Hi everyone! Sorry to be a bother, but I've only got so much money in my account right now so I'd really like to split a room with someone. I got a double at the Illumine, one of the Dusk hotels (thanks, Demyx!), and I'm willing to wait for a share of rent until whoever wants to room with me can get a job. It's pretty inexpensive if the cost is being split, actually.

I'm a really good roommate, too! I'm clean and I do tend to talk a lot but I'm a very reliable and responsible person. I have an in-town reference who can tell you how awesome I am (in very few words) if I asked him to, but then I'd probably owe him a big favor and he'd be annoyed with me, so please don't ask for a reference unless you're desperate to make sure I'm not a crazy and I'm still desperate for a roommate. :D

I don't care about gender either, as long as you understand that I have no problems with burning or electricuting you if you don't keep your hands and eyes to yourself.

Thanks!"

"event","So apparently these things have journals too, neat! Well, I don't know how long I'm going to be here, but it can't hurt to write in it.

Hi to anyone reading, I'm Selphie! I'm writing this in between messaging a boy named Sora. Geez, this Sidekick thing is really handy. It's almost enough to make me not want to firaga whoever brought me here. Getting knocked out from behind and kidnapped is <i>so lame</i>. I wouldn't be surprised if my rank goes down for this. (Paycuts are lame too.)

As the saying goes, the first priority of a prisoner is to escape! And regardless of having a huge area to walk around in, I'm here against my will, so I'm definitely a prisoner. Does anyone know where the nearest Garden is?"

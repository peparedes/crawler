While it may not have been up as some were thinking it would, it was definately up.  It seems that 18-29 year old participation was up about as much as most other age groups.

There are some interesting omissions on both sides.  See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/10/31/111452/80 for more info.  I think I mentioned this in class, but K5 was down at the time."

"event","Energy concerns have been an issue in this year's election as oil prices have risen to their highest absolute levels in history (gas went up by over 30 cents per gallon overnight in the Haute about a week ago, though it quickly went down some again).  However, is this a good thing?

A person over at K5 has done a fairly insightful analysis into the situation, citing lots of sources and bringing up many issues.  It's at http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/10/25/223237/26

So, how do we want to handle this?  Has either candidate adequately addressed the issue of energy and oil prices during their campaign?  Does the government need to fund research into alternate energy sources, or is the world market going to compel private interests to do so anyway (go Libertarians!)?"

He hints at a dislike for our favorite ignorer of the bill of rights Ashcroft.  However, the image Kerry presents on his views of civil rights aren't really in line with his past actions.

"event","Prescription drug coverage has been a hot topic this election, both at the presidential and the Indiana gubernatorial level.  In my mind, the question we should be asking is not ""What can we do to help people pay for their drugs?"" but rather ""Why are drugs so expensive?"".

So, why are prescription drugs so expensive in the US?

Is it FDA regulation, where the long and involved approval process costs a lot of money?  If this is the reason, is this a consequence we're willing to live with for the supposed assurance of safer drugs that this regulation and approval brings?

Is it drug patents?  There's no doubt that drug patents make drugs more expensive when they are new, but is that temporary price increase worth the cost to help the drug companies develop new products?  Remember, without drug patents, there wouldn't be nearly the incentive to develop new drugs as there would be little to no money to be made from the drug itself, while the research to make a new drug costs a lot of money.  Drug research would be relegated to the academic type of research, where the only reason research happens is for the betterment of society and personal fame.  If we were to eliminate or reduce the time of drug patents, would the reduction in costs justify the slowdown in development of new drugs that would likely follow?

Is it greed of the drug companies?  The Eli Lilly CEO worked the entire year for a salary of $1 a couple years back.  Are these companies just trying to get rich quick, or does it really cost this much to develop, approve, produce, and distribute a prescription drug?

Is this ""just the way things are""?  Shall we say that this is just the way things have to be and totally ignore the issue?  I don't think that will work.

So, this brings us to the question of a solution.  We all know that price controls don't work very well in a capitalist market like we enjoy in the US, and nobody wants to raise taxes excessively.  So, what exactly should be done?"

"event","I just got done watching the last presidential debate, and I realized something: most of what they debate over are things they don't actually have direct control over!  The president doesn't go to war, congress says the nation goes to war.  The president doesn't control the economy, the people, the Fed, and Congress (though tax policy) do that.  About the only thing the president actually has fairly direct control over that really gets discussed is diplomatic relations, and Pres. Bush seems to like to shy away from that sometimes.

Don't get me wrong, the president has some influence.  If the president walks into congress and says ""I will veto any budget that..."", congress will probably listen unless there's enough dissentment that everyone knows they can get the magic 2/3 majority (which is REALLY hard to do when both the house and the senate are so evenly split between the two major parties).  If the president walks up to Mr. Greenspan and says something, he'll probably at least listen (which is better than he'd do if I walked up and said something), though he may not act on it.

A lot of what the candidates are campaigning on are actually issues people should be electing their congressmen (representatives and senators both) on.  Those are the people with direct control over these issues.  The president is the commander in chief of the armed services, not tax policy jockey.

I'm not really a history buff, but has it always been this way, or when did this start?  It seems that, while it's good to know the president's position on the issues (as he gets to check/balance the congresscritters' actions), the president isn't exactly in the position to implement all this stuff they campaign on."

"event","Well, I thought the in-class debate went pretty well.  I will agree that Deaton probably won the debate, though it was probably fairly close.  I'd like to congratulate everyone involved: The candidates, their campaign staff, the media members, and Dr. Watt for helping to pull the whole thing off.  I heard that part of the debate was televised on the evening news.  I recorded it but didn't see anything when I flipped through it.  Does anyone have a tape or something of the segment?

Some other things regarding debates:  Did anyone happen to tape the debate for IN governor?  I was home by the time I learned the libertarian candidate would be included and couldn't set my PVR at school to record it.  I think it would be insteresting to see how the 3rd party candidate affects the already more focused issues in a more local campaign (like that for governor).

Yeah, I'm going to be watching way too much taped stuff, especially since I haven't yet seen the last Presidential debate (though I do have it recorded)."

"event","Apparently some third party candidates (specifically Cobb and Badnarik) actually have participated in a couple of debates.  Of course, the two frontrunners (our friendly sleezeballs, I mean upstanding citizens, Bush and Kerry) weren't in attendance as they have explicitly agreed to only debate each other in the CPD run debates.

CSPAN does have a <a href=""rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/c04/c04090604_third.rm"">steamable version</a> of the Sept. 6 debate between these two candidates.  Apparently Badnark does prefer the emphasis on the ""nar"" of his name (all my Libertarian associates have been putting the emphasis on the ""Bad"").  You learn something new every day.

"event","Libertarian party candidate Michael Badnarik and Green party David Cobb were apparently arrested for trying to enter the presidential debate in St. Louis.  See <a href=""http://badnarik.org/newsfromthetrail.php?p=1346"">Badnarik's news page</a> for some additional (if biased) information.

While I admire the candidates' desire to ""break the two party system"" by getting a third party in on the election, I see Badnarik's actions as almost hypocritcal.  As a Libertarian, he should be all for allowing independent organizations (such as the Commission on Presidential Debates) to set their own rules and exclude whomever they please from their essentially private functions.  Then again, maybe this just prooves that such a system works: the private organization set their rules, and those rules were enforced."

"event","The ever-continuing rivalry between science, government, and religion continues with Bush, and likely will with Kerry.  It's something people have to deal with.  There's simply too many people in the US who are very religious to discount religious implications of new scientific developments: doing so would be policital suicide.  However, public officials must also be careful not to alienate the scientific community, to which is owed nearly every facet of modern civilization, while doing so.

"event","This seems to have been slow to hit the news, and you possibly haven't heard about it.  In fact, when I first read it, I wasn't skeptical since it hadn't hit any major news sites.  The New York Times seems to have picked it up now though, and others are starting to as well.

Of course, if this does turn out to be nuclear in nature (many things can create mushroom clouds, from forest fires to exploding tankers to nuclear detonations), it could have a SERIOUS impact on the election since, of course, our president has to deal with issues like this.

I found <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/13/politics/campaign/13korea.html"">an article in NYT</a> (<a href=""http://news.google.com/news?as_q=mushroom+cloud&svnum=10&as_scoring=r&hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nsrc=New+York+Times&as_nloc=&as_occt=any&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=&as_mind=13&as_minm=8&as_maxd=12&as_maxm=9"">Google Link</a>) that's currently only a few hours old on Kerry's stance.  He indicates (correctly, in my view) that Bush's obsession with Iraq and Sadaam has led him to forget about the other ""problem nations"" out there.  North Korea, being run by a person who would probably be legally insane in the US, is one such nation.

The current official line from US government sources is that the explosion was not nuclear in nature, and may have been the result of a forest fire.  If that's the case, all is fine, though I do agree: Bush needs to pay attention to other things.  Bush isn't the only one at fault here of course, but the fact that there's speculation of a nuclear detonation and we don't immediately know what it is raises concern in my mind.  There were reports recently that US intelligence believed NK to be working on nuclear weapons.

I certainly don't support rash behavior like invading North Korea (we alrealy look bad enough with all of our dictator removals), though we certainly need to pay attention to our other problems.  Remember, terrorism is NOT the only threat to ""national security"" we face, though it's one our friends in the White House like to play up because it's convenient and fresh in everyone's mind (especially with this weekend being the rememberence of 9/11)."

I'll also take the opportunity to gripe a bit.
I told myself I'd never make a LiveJournal account.  Well, I guess I finally had to.  Don't expect to find anything other than RH399 stuff on here.

On the subject of secure passwords: Yes, the password I use for BS sites like this is based on a word (though it's a name, not a dictionary word).  There's a reason for that: I don't really care about how secure my account on LiveJournal or SlashDot is.  It's really rather unimportant.  So thanks for making me create a new password that can never be used for anything actually secure...

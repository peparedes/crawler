Your favorite place to have sex is the pitcher's mound of a ball stadium, under the arena lights. You are extremely loud when having sex. You don't mind people watching, taking pictures or videotaping you no matter what you're doing. Your motto is It's all about ME!

It makes me sound like Atobe... o_O;;"

"event","Okay...so this isn't exactly my first day on the job.

Still, introductions first, no? Kirihara Akaya, researcher for Crack Corporation. <strike>Not so</strike> Looking forward to working with you guys. *grins*

First, I'd like to say that...well...I LOVE my room. Really.
Because there are really cool guys all living around me. Take Momoshiro for example. Boy, he's such a friendly guy <strike>with a very big appetite</strike>.
Then, there's Yagyuu. He's a researcher as well. Just don't get this guy made at you.
Oh, can't forget Niou as well. So cool, sexy even! X3 Another one of my fellow researchers. 
And Saeki? Haven't met him yet. Wonder how HE would be like...

Second, I haven't really been doing anything... X3 I wonder what that fortune-telling guy said was true...
Well, it'd better be. Or else he's gonna end up with a very bloody nose.

Yeah, that's all I need to say. See ya.

ooc: first post. ooc Kirihara Akaya. endof."

"event","As many of us were, I was shocked with my mouth wide open as I watched the video clip on TV with Michael Richards and his very racial tirade. We don't know him as 'Michael Richards' - but as Kramer from ""Seinfeld"". He was the funny, lovable, eccentric neighbor of Seinfeld's and was one of my favorite characters on the show. Now I can't watch the show the same way again..... in fact I don't think I want to watch the show. 

He ""apologized"" on David Letterman and stated that he wasn't sure if this show was an appropriate place. I agree with that - who goes on David Letterman to make an apology for racial slurs? There is nothing serious about that show..... in fact people were actually laughing in the audience!! Jerry Seinfeld and Richards both told the audience to basically shut up and that this wasn't funny.

His apology is bull to me. It would be a BIT understandable if he let the N word slip out (the N word is unfortunately being used more in this society because of Rap music, Boondocks, and Dave Chappelle) but the N word didn't slip out - it ""slipped out"" 6-7 times plus he used a disturbing reference to blacks being lynched.

It is human nature for your true feeling to come out when you are angry and passionate about something...... this incident is an example of that. How can you apology if you are a racist? Being called a racist is a very strong term in this country because no one wants to be labeled a racist. However a lot of people don't know that they are. Richards had said, "".... and I am not a racist! That what's so insane about this!"" - oh yes you are. It doesn't take a sociology class to decipher that video clip and apology - it was all very obvious."

Well the summer was a blur, so I am not even sure myself. I simply just forgot about this old journal. I saw that my past entry was back in may - that is quite sad! Needless to say A LOT has happened since that - and it is November now!

One thing that I haven't talked about at all (and I am doing nothing but talking about it) is that I've been diagnosed with depression. I am being treated for it now but looking back at how I was earlier this year and particuarly this summer, I was at my lowest point. During the summer it had gotten so bad I was considering suicide. I never want to get to that point again. Being sad constantly is no way to live life. My main problem was I just wasn't talking about stuff - and keeping everything bottled up inside. I have learned not to do that anymore (which is why I am freely talking about this on livejournalm I need an outlet of some sort). I've also learned that Zoloft can be your best friend! My God what a drug! Zoloft really does help but opening up more and counseling has help a lot as well. The shock of me going to the hospital for depression back in september changed my mother - she did a complete 360 and our relationship is a lot better. So I think that everyone goes through very difficult times - I just wish that I had treated my depression a lot sooner instead of letting it interfere with my life.

Well because of paperwork complications, I am out of school for the semester. I didn't want that since I am trying to get things back on track - but I also see this as a much needed break. I am still working at the Ralph Bunche International Affairs center and I also have a lot more time to work on HU STAND related stuff............

Speaking of STAND, things are going VERY well with that, which makes me happy. 

STAND = Students take action now Darfur

I think being the president of STAND got me a position on the Sterling committee of Africa Action (YES!!). I've been trying to become a committee member for the longest time but I was finally accepted! I love Africa Action, those are some cool people

Anyway, November 6th and 7th STAND is having a film series to promote awareness about Sudan/Darfur through film. Monday's film  ""Darur Diaries"" was very successful. A lot of people came by and we had food. Today we are going to show out second film, ""Lost Boys of Sudan"".... so I hope that turns out okay.

STAND has also raised over $300 in donations and we are getting the word out on campus. We are going to have a meeting next monday and I am going to discuss becoming more political with this crisis. Things are turning out well.

Too much typing my hands hurt. More updates will be released later.

This is from MSN  entertainment news..... these stories are hilarious to me:


************************

<b>Lance and Reichen on the Rocks?</b><p>

 
Looks like Lance Bass' coming out has been given the unofficial tabloid seal of approval. Just days after the erstwhile 'NSYNC-er revealed his ""very stable"" relationship with reality show winner-cum-model-actor Reichen Lehmkuhl in his People cover story, the breakup rumors have begun, courtesy of the New York Post, which predicts they won't ""be together much longer."" 

""Reichen forced Lance to come out just at the same time he has a book coming out so he could ride the publicity wave,"" a mole alleges to the paper. ""He is a big gay activist and very controlling. He wants Lance to give up his straight friends and do whatever he tells him to."" 

Reichen, whose upcoming memoir is titled, ""Here's What We'll Say: A Memoir of Growing Up, Coming Out, and the U.S. Air Force,"" has been making the media rounds to talk about Bass, whom he's been dating for a few months. 

""I will say that Lance is happier than he has ever been,"" he tells ""Access Hollywood. ""It has been a long ride and it's a huge relief and I couldn't be happier for him and I couldn't be more proud of him."" 

He adds to ""The Insider,"" ""I'm happy it's shocking people ... I couldn't be more proud of Lance. It's definitely a sense of relief. There are a lot more smiles. We are so happy about it."" 

And in still another sit-down, this one with ""Entertainment Tonight,"" he gushes, ""I support Lance wholeheartedly. I couldn't be more proud of what he's doing."" 

Bass' overworked rep is sidestepping the split chatter, telling the Post, ""Lance couldn't be happier with the overwhelming reaction he's getting from all over the world."""

<b>'Survivor' Richard Hatch Sent to Prison<br>
Jul 24, 9:15 AM EST<br>


The Associated Press</b><p>

PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Richard Hatch has been sent to a federal prison in Oklahoma as he serves a 51-month sentence for failing to pay taxes on the $1 million he won on the debut season of ""Survivor.""

Hatch, 45, of Newport, arrived last week at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. It wasn't immediately clear why Hatch was moved or whether he will serve out his prison sentence at the facility, which is a hub for prisoners transferring through the federal system.

A federal jury convicted Hatch in January of failing to pay taxes on the ""Survivor"" prize and other income. He was sentenced in May to 51 months in prison by a judge who said the reality TV star had lied repeatedly on the witness stand.

Hatch had previously been held at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts.

He would prefer to serve his sentence near family in Rhode Island or in Florida, said his lawyer, Michael Minns.

""He should be in a camp,"" Minns said. ""The camps are the most comfortable of the uncomfortable. They are still jails, but they get to see the sky and be outside. It's bad for Richard, who is an outdoor person.""

Hatch became known on the CBS show as the ""fat naked guy"" for refusing to wear clothes."

"event","Altogether I have 8 body piercing: 1 tongue barbell, 3 on each ear, and 1 upper cartledge. I used to have my eyebrow pierced but I took that out to much dismay (I loved that thing but it was beginning to reject).

On Friday, after helping my mom as a volunteer for Howard University's graduation ceremonies, I was starving and went to Wendy's for a junior bacon cheeseburger plain. I inhaled that thing.......... and I also inhaled my tongue barbell. Yes you read that correctly! I actually ate the ball off the end of my tongue barbell. When I finished eating my sandwich I was like, ""hmmm, my tongue feels weird.... feels more.... light?!"". This is not like losing the back to an earring. Basically if you lose the ball to the barbell you are screwed because you have to buy another one. It was my fault really - I should have periodically tightened the ball (sometimes you just forget to do that). (((sigh...)))

I went for 2 days without that thing in my mouth and I was missing it. I love my tongue barbell! It's apart of me! My mom went to Hot Topic for me and bought one - a 14g (hehehe) - without knowing that it's LARGER than the one I had! So I am even more pleased. My mom's BF would just prefer that she not buy it and let the ""damn thing"" close up. He's country and old-fashion.... 

I am a fan of body piercing, I just luv em and hope to get more in the future!

"event","<center><font size=""4"">FROM BBC WORLD NEWS WEBSITE - 'Melting pot' America</font><p>

<b>Melting pot</b></center> 

Americans take pride in their ""melting pot"" society (a term coined by an immigrant, Israel Zangwill) that encourages newcomers to assimilate into the American culture. 

But the melting pot imagery has been contested by the idea of multiculturalism, the ""salad bowl theory"", or as it is known in Canada, the ""cultural mosaic"", whereby the immigrants retain their own national characteristics while integrating into a new society. 

Some go further. Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington says that large-scale Latino immigration poses a threat to American identity. 

According to Professor Huntington the reality of American history is best described as tomato soup: the blending of new ingredients adds spice without compromising the essential character of tomato. 

""Contributions from immigrant cultures modified and enriched Anglo-Protestant culture of founding settlers. 

""Contributions from immigrant cultures modified and enriched Anglo-Protestant culture of founding settlers. 

""The essentials of that founding culture remained the bedrock of the US identity, however, at least until the last decades of the 20th Century,"" Mr Huntington writes in his controversial 2004 book Who Are We. The Challenges to America's National Identity. 

He sees the gravest threat to American identity in Mexican immigration which, according to him, is splitting America in two. 

""As their numbers increase, Mexican Americans feel increasingly comfortable with their own culture and often contemptuous of American culture"", he says. 

<center><b>Sense of history</b></center><P>

But are the Mexican-dominant areas of the US really consolidating themselves into a culturally and linguistically distinct and economically self-reliant bloc within the US, as Professor Huntington states? 

Douglas Rivelin from the National Immigration Forum contests Mr Huntington's view of Latinos as different from other immigrant groups. 

""I was astounded that someone so smart could write such a book,"" he says. 

""He is totally missing what is going on in the US. The same thing could have been written in 1924 about Irish or other immigrants, and it would have been equally wrong."" 

""Bagels and pizzas and spaghetti were new things at one time... immigrants come and change America and are changed by America."""

"event","On Monday and Tuesday of this week I start Bikram yoga - and I love it! It is SOOOOOOOO intense, yet fun. I like doing unusual things, and this is definitely out of the ordinary. The shop is called ""Bikram Yoga, College of India"" and is located in TenleyTown, a rich part of Washington, DC and pretty far from Howard Univ..... buuuut if you wanna do things like this you have to leave the ghetto (sarcasm).

It's a small shop and the room is heated to over 100F, mostly dry heat. I bought my $20 unlimited weekly class card and got a free yoga mat. 

A NOTE ON YOGA MATS: Why in the hell are they so expensive?! They are a piece of thin, cheap, plastic rubber.... why or why are they $20 or more....... even on Ebay!

Anyway, the combination of the 26 poses and the heat make for a great workout, even if it doesn't feel like a workout. It's weird but you get used to the heat. The heat also makes you sweat buckets..... which is a good thing. It is very detoxifying. 

After you leave class you feel SO good! I've even noticed a difference in myself after just one class. Because you are doing stretches in extreme heat, it loosens your muscles and you can do things that you can't normally do. Wednesday I couldn't go because my job was hosting a lecture by a very important Ambassador from the State Dept., and that lasted a long time and today (Thursday) I don't think I can go because I have to go to see ........... Dorris

**********************************************************

Now, Dorris is this Nigerian woman who did my kinky twist braids. Yes I have braids, or well they are called ""the two strand twist"" and are done with kinky hair. I've decided to go natural back in Jan so while I am waiting to let my hair grow out I went to go get this

Kaosy has had these twists since the beginning of school and they've lasted such a long time on her I asked ""who did your hair?"" and she told me about Dorris, who lives out in New Carlton, MD. About 2 weeks ago and I went to go get my hair done by her and it called $120 all together = $100 for the service and $20 for the hair I had to buy hahahahaha

AMERICAN VS AFRICAN HAIR BRAIDING:

I miss Ghana...... first of all you had like 5 people doing your hair at the same time, so it didn't take that long. I had gotten micros in Ghana and it took 6 hours. 6 hours!! Secondly, it cost all together $10 in their currency.

America? The 2 strand twist by one person cost $120 and took from 11 am to 7 pm - in one chair - the whole time - with CNN news on.......

Anyway, I got this done about 1 1/2 - 2 weeks ago and a lot have already fallen out. I've talked with a lot of people and EVERYONE agrees that this isnt right. She just didnt do my hair right. And I am pissed because I am not rich and I am a college student and $100 up front is a lot. I expect my hair to last at least a month, come on

I called Dorris up last time and I told her about it and she got very defensive with an attitude. I dont appreciate that Dorris, you know! You know that if my hair wasnt compatible with kinky twist than you should have said so BEFORE doing it. She just wanted that cash money. But after 1/2 hour of fussing with her she agreed to redo it and she is going to do it today. 

Thank God because the front of my head was looking a mess............"

"event","I am sitting here in the computer lab at my school doing this entry after leaving a very nice event I was invited to. The Bunche Center (were I work at) has some awsome perks! The druration of your time working at the Bunche center you WILL get invited to at least one cultural event, academic lecture, or something at the Statre Dept. I love this place

I was invited to the 14th Annual Cultural Awareness dinner, hosted at the Blackburn center. Each year they have a theme and this year is was India. They served Indian food, Indian dancers performed, and they did free henna. Henna is were they paint your hands in a red dye - sort of like a temporary tattoo, but more classy. I am sitting here writting this entry with dry henna on my hands! hahahaha

The food was good, I love Indian food however it was watered down for American tastes. I've been to a real Indian resturant before and the food is so spicy it can make your eyes water. I like that! But this food wasn't spicy at all. The dancers were very good, I enjoyed it a lot.

The dress code was casual dress - which means DRESSY at Howard. Black folks like to show off there clothes (ha ha). I wore a skirt I got made in Ghana and a black dress shirt with my braids pulled up and earrings. I looked HOT in my honest opinion! LOL. I wanted to wear something cultural since this was a cultural event.....

At the event I ran into Angela, a girl that I met during the New Orleans trip and Alex Blackshire. It was cool chatting with the both of them. Angela and I worked together in New Orleans and Alex and I went to the Student Leadership conference back in October. Alex is also president of the Graduate Student Association - or something like that. I know he's president of something. They are two very special people and very accomplished! YOU GO GUYS!

....... I am going to go and chip off my henna paint so I can see what it looks like!!"

I have been thinking about starting Bikram Yoga. This is a form of yoga were the room is heated to 100 F and it focuses on flexiblity and movements. I've always heard about it and it peaked my interest..... but it wasn't until about 2 weeks ago were Brenda, my mom's co worker, said she does Bikram yoga at a studio on the other side of town. I thought that was SOOOOO awsome and it got me thinking - if she can do it, I can too! I was at my mom's office near the end of the work day and at 5 pm Brenda went into the bathroom and changed into her yoga clothes and left the office. I was SOOOO impressed!

Here is the website to Bikram yoga in Washington, DC: http://www.dcbikramyoga.com

I am really excited about this - I might even start this weekend! I've even started looking at yoga mats on Ebay, LOL. Pricing is rather reasonable. For beginners they have this special were it's $20 for one week of unlimited classes - and they have classes 3-4 times a day, everyday. In addition to that, it's 20% off for students. They also have Unlimted monthly fees for $150 ($120 for students). I think that is a very good price - given the fact that this is a specialty exercise AND the studio is located in a very expensive part of town.

<font size=""4"">THE CORRELATION BETWEEN BEING IN LOVE AND HAVING A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna</font>

The song ""Like a prayer"" came out in 1990 and back then it created insane controversy - the song itself wasn't controversial, it was the msuic video. When it first came out I was too young to understand or care but now that I am older and have seen the video I AM BLOWN AWAY BY IT. It is the most ingenius and creative music video I have ever seen. 

You have to use both the song and the video hand-in-hand to understand the message that Madonna is trying to convey. After seeing the video it is totally understandable why it was SO controversial back then (and even now) - it was banned and wouldn't play on TV. 

<font size=""3"">
REASONS WHY THIS VIDEO IS CONTROVERSIAL:</font>

1. Madonna gets intimate with a black Jesus
2. There's a black Jesus!
3. Madonna shows stigmata signs on her hands
4. Interracial love
5. A slight hint at race relations
6. Madonna dances in a field of burning crosses

.... so you see what I mean. I said above ""a slight hint at race relations"" I wasn't refering to the interracial relationship but something else that happens in the video. What I like about the video is how it's done - your focus when watching it is not the interracial relationship but the religious factors - and that was VERY smart of her. The man that played Jesus was the PERFECT Jesus, you can't deny that -  but it's still a shocker that he's black to most people. 

The video is very symbolic and I think most people interpretated it incorrectly. You also have to listen carefully to the lyrics too. It took me a couple of viewings of the video to get it, and even then I went on the internet to see some other people's interpretations

<img src=""http://www.beautifulmadonna.com/videostill/likeaprayer/048.jpg""><img src=""http://www.beautifulmadonna.com/videostill/likeaprayer/087.jpg"">

<img src=""http://www.beautifulmadonna.com/videostill/likeaprayer/209.jpg""><img src=""http://www.beautifulmadonna.com/videostill/likeaprayer/059.jpg"">

Here are 2 song interpretations from www.lyricinterpretations.com:

1. This song is about the correlation between being in love and having a relgious experience. Let me break it down.

""Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home""

Ok, here she is saying that she loves this person so much that when she hears him call her name she feels safe and secure kind of like someone who has been saved feels safe in the home of God's kingdom.


""When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there""

Again, its like prayer has been answered that she has fallen so madly in love. Also, some religons are known for late night masses such as Catholics and their midnight masses where the ""power"" of the Lord is felt.

""I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me""

When she hears his voice, its melodic and soothing like an angel singing and being in love with him is like walking on air. Falling out of the sky refers to the intensity that she is falling for me and ""Heaven help me"" is saying she is out of control with her feeling.

""Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing""

This refers to being love just like being a child with not a care in the world.In other words, her love is a dream, something she hopes to never wakes up from. 

The on my knees bit symbolizes prayer in relgion and in love which she is praying to. This song shows how we as people tend to put more faith in the ones we ""love"" than the ones that created us.


AND HERE IS NUMBER 2:


I think it's about having a deep and overpowering love for someone, intertwined with the religion concept and, well, sex. 

""When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there""

A couple often call out each other's name whilst making love. This makes her feel a heavenly sensation, like god is touching her. When she's down on her knees, she's firstly in the position for praying, but at the same time being submissive to her lover, so her love and her prayer for god trancesend each other. She wants her lover to feel the same way, to feel touched by god just as she does when they make love. She feels both her lover's and god's power, the midnight hour may be referred to as something evil and distressing in her life, that she copes with, due to her love. For the final line of the chorus, she once again, describes her love for this man (the black jesus, maybe?) and again, tells him that she's willing to 'take him there'. 'There' seems to be the a spiritual place, that Madonna is taken to my her love, a heavenly place that she wants both her and her lover to be there. 

Summed up, my interpretation is this song is pretty much about sex, but not in a filthy, porn kind of way. But in a powerful, passionate way. Making love can be such a heavenly thing, that it can only be compared with a 'prayer' communicating with god, the sensation you feel whilst making love."

"event","I call it ""Inside Out Man"" but it's really Inside Man, and in the words of the comic book guy from the Simpsons: BEST.MOVIE.EVER

I went to go see that movie on Sunday with Jessie and Koasy without knowing anything about it before hand - except for Lashondra telling me that it's awsome and that it's a Spike Lee joint. I cringed when she said Spike Lee joint because I don't care for the man (and neither does she) but she told me not to worry about the fact that he made the movie.

*** REASOSN FOR NOT LIKING SPIKE LEE:

1. Very arrogant and embarrasses himself on national TV
2. Makes movies that have superb issues on race relations and black issues, but does't make them or market them so that mainstream America will pay attention to it. (Crash was a movie on race relations - a bad movie - but it was mainstream...... Spike! you could have made Crash!)
3. In politcal debates he yells and throws out conspiracy theories - adding on to more reasons for people not to listen to him


............ this is why I was shocked at how good Inside Man was. It hasn't been marketed very well (maybe because Spike Lee made it) and for some unknown reason Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs down!! But support this movie and go and see it..... seeing this movie will set a good example to Spike to make more movies like this

He is one of my favorite authors...... and the 2 guys that wrote ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"".....come on, they knew Dan Brown wrote the Da Vinci Code - they appeared in just about every Dan Brown documentary.

Anyway, ASB had anothe meeting today discussing another ASB during the summer months. The details aren't there yet but this should be interesting. I am trying to go to Ghana this summer so I really need to know the dates of ASB summer so I can sign up for that too. We'll see......."

"event","I keep complaining that things are sooooo buys in my life - but maybe that's the way it is. I am 21 and I can't even imagine having a child - there are girls out there in a situation like that. Am I undisciplined? Do I have a poor work ethic? I really don't know.

I currently have a part time job everyday in the mornings, then class - this semester I have 21 credits (dropped 2 courses), became president of an organizations were we have event planning and meetins a lot, and studying and cleaning somewhere in the middle of all of that. Now if I had a child that would DOUBLE my work. 

I might be undisciplined and have a low work ethic. I guess it's something that I have to work on. I don't know what is considered a ""normal"" work load for a 21 year old college kid. 

Which brings me to HU STAND - this club is getting busier by the minute. I am partly to blame, I am creating all these things. But in order to educate the general public about Sudan, an ongoing effort needs to happen. I called a meeting for tonight and I just got back from it. The main discussion was about a lecture that is going to be held at Howard Univ. main auditorium - Cramton. Holds roughly 800 people. The problemsssssss:

1. it is going to look PITIFUL if less than 200 people show up. Cramton is a massive building
2. Spring break is next week and that cuts off an entire week of working on this
3. there may be lack of advertising time
4. the event is march 29th!!!
5. is 7pm too late?

I just want to scream. This is a huge event and the first time Mr. Simon Deng has come to Howard. This man is a former sudanese slave who escaped and came to the USA and is walking from New York to Washingotn, DC and along the way gathering walkers and stopping for various events - such as this one. 

This has to go well, otherwise it will reflect poorly on Howard. I am sure sure we can pull off bring over 200 people. We'll see.

Oh and not to mention I am leaving this friday for ALTERNATIVE SPRING BREAK 2006!!!! NEW ORLEANS! YAHHH VOLUNTEER WORK! YESSSSSSS

"event","I just got back from a 2 1/2 hour orientation for ASB 2006 (Alternative Spring Break 2006).
I can't remember if I mentioned this or not but the chapel and 2 other Howard groups are going to New Orleans, Louisiana for 1 week to perform volunteer work and community outreach --- ALL.EXPENSES.PAID.

I heard 400 people applied but that might just be an exaggeration or rumor but there was a selection committee and my 2 friends and I got chosen - me, jessie, and kaosy. I am so glad they are coming

We've had a series of orientations and today was the last one - and the longest. I know I am going to sound like a horrible person for saying this but this meeting was pure crap. 2 1/2 hours of crappiness. it was mostly speakers or inspiration and whatnot, and that was nice but I thought this was going to be a SERIOUS orientation to give us info as to what we are getting ourselves into. there was a little of that but not 2 1/2 hours worth. Plus they didn't feed us, hehehe. I had to sneak to McDeath to get some ""food"", that gave me indigestion.

The other meetings were a lot more informative and aside from this one I am very happy and excited that I am going to provide work were there is work needed...... because our government if definately not doing it and as citizens we need to take matters into our own hands!!

P.S. - I just drank a carmel macchiato soy with whip cream! lol, i love my starbucks drinks, they are addictive..... so that's why I am ""awake"" as my mood"

"event","Dang this was a busy week - youhave no idea. 

MONDAY: My club, HU STAND had a 2 day exhibit featuring club information and a exhibit called, ""The Children of Darfur"". These are 8 drawings that refugee children drew in the Darfur region of Sudan. A doctor from France asked the children to draw these picture of what they've experienced and seen - needless to say the pics are very disturbing and violent (and these were 5,6,7 year olds). It puts into perspective what's going on over there through a child's eyes. I won't go into the politics of Sudan - because it's mind boggling - but HU STAND chapters at different universities were formed out of concern of what's going on over there. The exhibit lasted all day and me and other club members were very proud of it - it was the best looking exhibit there. Everyone worked hard and I am proud of them. Also a reporter from a newspaper came to our table and wants to do a story on it!

This was also a day I had 2 midterms to take............ since last friday I was surviving off of a few hours of sleep and coffee, coffee, coffee

TUESDAY: day 2 of the HU STAND exhibit. It was a little less stessful that day - but the most successful day since we got lots of recongition from organization leaders on campus who wanna work with us. There was also a lecture on the Sudan at 4 pm from Dr. Robert Bechold - an expert on the Sudan and Middle Eastern studies. Brilliant man however it was hard to tell what side he was on. He discussed in detial the historical factors involved in the Sudan conflict but then..... stopped. He didn't discussed ANYTHING about what is happening now..... interesting. 

It was also interesting that a rep from the Sudanese Embassy and a random man from the State Department were sitting in the audience. Hmmmm..... 

WEDNESDAY: Catch-up day for classes because I've missed a few and had to sort out all the HU STAND stuff. We normally have HU STAND meetings on wednesdays but I was like..... HELL TO THE NO. Next wednesday, shoot. 

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY: catch up days. Friday is pay day and my university's Convocation day. Honestly I don't really care. I am going back to my room to sleep. The charter day speaking is some woman named Suzanne de Passe and no one knows who she is. This is really hilarious - pics of this woman were distributed throughout campus and the pics are airbrushed and look like her 20 year old counterpart. A REAL pic of her was published in the school newspaper and she looks like a train wreck. The the words of my Co-worker..... ""She looks like 20 miles of bad road""!!!!

And I will end there on that note!"

"event","""I need to talk to myself"" = meaning that I need to write in my blog. I feel like I'm talking to myself in this thing!

I need to because the past several days have been kinda stressful. As of right now I am not validated as a student (that's nothing knew at Howard University.... EVERYONE goes through this), had a fight with my friend Lashondra, was made president of HU STAND, and I am behind in all of my classes. 

HU STAND = Howard University Students take action now, darfur. It's a student-run organization that promotes awareness of the genocide that is occuring in the Sudan. They made me president, which is awsome but A LOT of work in involved in that. I've become VERY busy with it and it's already making my hair fall out (literarlly)

I gave my copy of ""the Divinci code"" to my friend Lashondra who read it and started freakin' out about it. The book scared her silly and I am not joking. She came to my room at 3 am in the morning and plopped herself in my beanbag chair saying she's not going anywhere. And I'm sitting there thinking - uh I have WORK at 8am! I kicked her out (which is something i hate doing) and she got upset and went to the lobby of the dorm hall and sat there until 7 am that morning to finish the book. You see she was too scared to read the book in her room by herself. Let me repeat myself - this book is ""The Di Vinci Code""

I felt bad at first but but she's mad at me because she says I am being insensitive about her feelings. And she probably is right. I generally look at things logically and I try to understand people through this means......... this situation defies logic to me. One night I became very frustrated with her and we are not talking right now. 

At this point I don't feel sorry because I think this situation is ridiculous - but then again, may I really don't understand her feelings. 

No more fun and games for awhile - I think I need time off for myself....."

BEST movie I've seen in a LONG time!! I am dead serious (and I am hard to please when it comes to movies 'cause I'm a little cynical)

When I first heard about this film, I could care less - I thought it was just some Hollywood artsy film that always comes out before Oscar time and takes all the awards home.... and we all know that nobody sees those types of movies. We all just sit at home watching the Oscars wondering why this preppy, abstract, unknown movie just won. I remember watching the commericals that came out last year about it.... 25 nominees, blah blah blah. When televison started labeling the movie ""controversial"" I started to listen in. Couldn't figure out why though. 

Then that wierd film critic with the Fro and mustache (I think he comes on Good Morning America) Gene something, anyway he labled the movie ""gay"". I was thinking, GAY??! Brokeback Mountain is a gay movie? A gay movie with cowboys?!

This film just got a WHOLE lot more interesting!

After that I wanted to see it. I'm not gay but I am an anime fan and we japanese anime fans love our shounen ai and yaoi! hehehehehe
(Shounen ai and yaoi both mean ""boy love"" but shounen ai is romantic-love and yaoi is sex-love).....<p>

<img src=""http://entimg.msn.com/i/gal/BrokebackMountain/BM_Cast_400.jpg""><p>

Anyway about 2 weeks ago I went to go see it with my Friend Kaosy (my ONLY friend who wanted to see it. I swear mentioning Brokeback Mountain let's you see which friends are homophobic are not!). On our way we ran into a guy on the school shuttle who was going to see Big Mama's House at the same theater as us. Me and Kaosy were like, NO and invited him to come with us. He knew about Brokeback and didn't care. That's a REAL man! Secure in his own masculinity to go see that with us! hahahaha

The movie lives up to all the hype. It's an EXCELLENT movie. I rarely become emotional or cry in movies..... this movie made me hold back my tears (mainly my ego). Beautiful story, the actors are amazing, the scenery of Wyoming is gorgeous, twists in the plotline and shockers, the ending is totally NOT predicable. I couldn't find a flaw.....

Ahem...... there is a yaoi scene near the beginning. (refer to above for translation of what yaoi means!). I wasn't expecting that, but it was cool. hehehehe, kinda graphic though

I HIGHLY reconmend that you go and see this film. If you're homophobic - well, you're missing out. My stand on gay coupling..... I don't care about it. Everyone has the right to be with who they love. I just HATE ""down-low"" gay men. That pisses me off. Even though the guys in this movie were down-low I can excuse it because there is a good reason as to why they did that. See the movie to see what I mean<p>

<img src=""http://entimg.msn.com/i/gal/BrokebackMountain/236-17_400.jpg""><p>

Jake Gyllenhaal.... wow what can I say. It was him and Keith Ledger that were the couple. PERFECT coupling.... it was very believable. Jake was the ""bitch"" in this relationship. Ouch - I didn't mean that as offensive!

Jake was awsome in this film..... it's just weird seeing him since I saw him in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and well, it's just weird seeing him in this film gettin' in on with a man. 

I am counting down the days until this comes out on DVD"

Had work this morning at 8 am but had to rush to go to the African panel discussion at 10am that ended at 1:30pm - Ariel (a group member from my club HU STAND) invited me to another meeting at 3pm about the African Union - had to cancel that because I had to get ready to meet in front of the Administration building to go to Capital Hill for the Congressional Black Caucus event that last until 7:30pm - get back home around 8:30pm to find out there is a ResFest meeting at 9pm!

AAAAAAAAAHHHH

Notice how I didn't mention CLASS anywhere in that summary. Yup, couldn't do class today. Really, it's not as bad as it sounds. I only have 3 classes today: the 2 that are at 11am and 5 pm were canceled (pure luck) but I had to skip the one at 12 noon to participate in the African panel discussion.

I figure sometimes you have to skip a class if an awsome opportunity pops up. That panel discussion, although LONG, was all about international development and there were some BIG power players there. It was SOOOOOO worth it - I mean, international development is my career goal

Some of the people that spoke at the panel:

1. British Ambassador to the US
2. Nigerian Ambassador to the US
3. Ambassador Ruth Davis (former Amb. to Benin and works at my job!)
4. Dr. Cummings, director of the African Studies department (brilliant man, i swear)
5. Dr. Morris, director of the Political Science department (another Brilliant man) - also came with me to the Black caucus event
6. ....... and may other experts in various fields of international development: economist from the United Nations, trade and globalization experts, climate, health policy, cultural, finance experts!

Needless to say I've learned a lot today. I felt my brain expanding slightly!"

Really, I am not bitter I just find Val's Day to be the most annoying day of the year. The principle behind Val's Day is sweet and a good idea. But here in this country it has become WAY too commerical. It's not about how much $$$ you should spend. Expensive ass flowers that'll die in a few days, chocolate that gives you cavities, cheesy teddy bears - NO. Your love interest should give you V Day everyday. (actually the chocolate gift is fine! hahaha..... I like Godiva)

With the above comments you are probably thinking that this girl is single. HA! I am not single - I am just in a long distance relationship (....which is actually considered single during Feb 14th). We suffer too during this day. I don't feel neglected or anything, I just can't stand the fake chessiness that everyone exhibits on V day because they think they should. Just be nice to me all year long! (and gimme some chocolate if ya want)

Now with that rambling out the way...........

This is going to be a very busy day for me today. I have 2 major events that I am going to:

1. An African symposium: 10am-1:30pm

2. Congressional Black caucus event in downtown Washington, DC: 5-7pm

Both events are for extra credit but I still would have gone anyway. Supposedly George W Bush is going to be at the Black caucus event, but we'll see. The African Symposium is being hosted by (my job) Bunche International Affairs center and the British Embassy. It starts at 10am so I have to find someone to fill my spot in since I am supposed to be at work at that time, hehehehe"

"event","Consider These 3 Thoughts !  



(1) Zero Gravity
When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity.  To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside-down, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C. The Russians used a pencil.  Your taxes are due again--enjoy paying them.



(2) Our Constitution  
""They keep talking about drafting a Constitution for Iraq. Why don't we just give them ours?   It was written by a lot of really smart guys, it's worked for over 200 years and hell, we're not using it anymore.""



(3) Ten Commandments  
The real reason that we can't have the Ten Commandments in a Courthouse is that you cannot post ""Thou Shalt Not Steal,"" ""Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery"" and ""Thou Shall Not Lie"" in a building full of lawyers, judges and politicians!   It creates a hostile work environment."

"event","Bought Alice 19th - volume 6 not to long ago, and finished it recently. Let me just put this out there: Alice 19th is wierd. Weird in a good way though.<p>

<img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591162432.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg""><p>

I wasn't too crazy about this volume - it was backstory galore. And backstory is fine, that is, if the characters are good. The only developed characters in Alice 19th are Frey and Kyo so naturally their backstory would be interesting. Kyo's story was explained a little but still the bulk of it is to come. I have a feeling it's going to be good. 

I feel that things havent been explained, that should have been explained. Like Nyozeka..... what.the.heck.is.it!? We still don't know. Billy and Mei ling whatever - they suck. They are boring and underdeveloped. They are the Mitsukake's of Alice 19th. (Fushigi Yuugi reference).

I don't totally dislike this volume. I think given the amount of action this volume would be awsome as a TV show episode. Plus there is a huge twist at the end, what I liked a lot and I totally didn't guess it. 

I give this volume 3 1/2 stars (***1/2)"

"event","YEESSSSSSSSS!

I signed up for ASB - Alternative Spring Break, which is hosted by the Rankin Chapel on my campus. It's in partnership with some other organization that I can't think of at the moment (a humanitarian group) and it's going to be during mid-March. They are sending Howard Univ students to New Orleans to perform volunteer development work and communtity outreach. 

Now why did I just, and I quote me, ""YEESSSSSSSSS!"" ?? Well I just found out that they are accepting EVERYONE that applyed. Ya see, it was originally a competative thing - they weren't accepting everyone who applied for this. (I think it was over 100 students).... they were only going to accept 30. Rumor has it that the chapel was pushing to get more sponsors to allow them to accept everyone.

So, now I am going to New Orleans. I really wanted to do this. I enjoy doing charity and volunteer work. I am also a political science major and we discuss all the factors of Hurricane Katrina and I would like to see them in person. What is real and what is twisted in the media"

"event","Well it's about time Lauren - I think it's been, what, 5 months?! Well maybe not that long.

I tend to do this - I find a really cool hobby, lose interest for awhile, and then come right back to it and stick with it. This time I am sticking with live journal and I will update it on a regular basis. Trust me, I don't have ADD (hahaha) this is just my habbit.

SO MUCH has happened since I've updated that I'm not going to even attempt to write it all here. I think I'll just sum up my day today (Sunday, Feb. 12th):

1. Woke up LATE (because I went to bed around 4am watching ""Bourne Identity"" and half of ""Super Size me"" with friends)
2. Cleaned alittle
3. Left my dorm and went up to campus to the Carnagie (sp?) Building. On the door was a post to let people know if they have been accepted to ASB (I'll explain later) - I find out they are postponing the announcement :(
4. Came back, updating live journal after what seems like a year of inactivity and waiting on my friend Cece to come by to play Howard-opoly.

..... and that's it. Oh wait, shouldn't homework and studying fit into this somewhere? hahaha, I know I know I am a slacker. Don't worry I will try and fit it in somewhere tonight (I hope, hell with 18 credits I NEED to fit it in)

Was listening to ""Independent Woman"" from my Ipod shuffle and now the song is stuck in my head. Very uplifting song :)"

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You're secretly hoping your partner will change for you.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>

"event","TODAY I and many other people just found out that Laura Bush and her cowboy husband are coming to our campus roughly 11:30 the next day (Thursday). Can you believe how quiet they kept it?! I found out about it from a little tiny block of text on the back of my college newspaper (the hilltop) that says:

""Laura Bush is coming Thursday. Get Ready""

I was like, huh what?! The ""get ready"" of course means protest. An E-mail was being circulated about a possible protest. My concern is that they are closing down our entire yard and all the buildings surrounding it during the times when they're here. 

What I don't like is how they are changing and twisting everything around for these two people that no one on this campus likes anyway. It just isn't fair - they even closed down the main cafeteria that is located in the same building were the husband and wife are having their event. Our Cafe is HUGE and they are going to try and squeeze all those students into the other cafe (bethune annex cafe) that is 1/3 the size of the original one.

Needless to say, tomorrow is going to be interesting. Let's see how things go........."

"event","I sometimes write reviews on amazon..... here is one i did on the ever so popular Fahrenheit 9/11. 
in my honeest opinion mike moore is not a radical, he is sarcastic and realistic. i don't get why he is made out to be a radical. anyway, here is my review.......

The ignorant side of America
                 
The re-election of Bush proves that there's an ignorant side to America. But, I suppose if I voice my opinion and state something negative about my country that makes me a bad guy. Sounds more like Communism than Democracy. Michael Moore is voicing his opinion, backed with facts, on his country. A country that he's proud of and wants to make better. I congratulate him on his work and release of Fahrenheit 9/11. 

Now for the 1 star reviews from republican conservatives who most likely haven't seen the movie........ It's a shame how most republicans follow and support other republicans when you should be supporting and following principles. Think about that."

"event","How nice, it's a cold and rainy day (grrrrrrrr.....)
Unfortunately I woke up super late and missed my class so I am going to use this day as a ""catch up day"". I will feel a lot better about myself if I spend the majority of my day in the library.

actually, I am not a slacker (i really do like school) it's just that this semester I have been and I am mad at myself. Oh man, I really hope I do well this semester and somehow catch up.

On a lighter note I am watching ""People's Court"" and, in the words of my friend Shannon, this show is on point! It puts your faith back in daytime TV. People's Court, Divorce Court, and The Price is Right are like that. 

Remember Jerry Springer? I do and I remember when it wasn't as trashy as it is now (is that possible?!)
For the hell of it, I watched it the other day. I swear the producers aren't even trying anymore. I honestly think they don't care. Basically the episode started out with a straight up guy in a dress stumble out and go, ""yup I'm cheating"". Come on....

Let me just randomly put this here.......

"event","Wendy Williams TELLS ALL!!!
$$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$

Hold on to your seats everyone, Wendy has released the names of the Gay & Bi Celebs.. and lots more juice!


This is in the industry....(Gay and Bi)


Rappers who are bi or gay (lets go with the men because the women are obvious):


Busta, Redman, Method Man, Q-Tip, Puffy (does it for control I think). Dr. Dre is straight up living a big lie. Tyrese hit Sisqo for coming on to him in a studio. I think McLyte is still with Pam from Martin. Russell Simmons throws gay parties. I heard things about LL too, Marlon Wayans (not Shawn), of course Will Smith, Tyson Beckford. 


NBA Players: 

Chris Webber..Steve Frances..Mobley guy from Houston...Damion from Portland And I'm sure there are a lot more, and they all date woman or are married..... (groupies beware !!! )


There is a crew of bisexual actresses that hang out together and most of them are married. They include Jada Pinkett, Jasmine Guy, Cree Summer, Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell, Debbie Allen (who apparently turned out the whole cast of A Different World).


Beyonce is NOT the only one with a bad breath problem, Juvenile's breath is WORST. Larenze Tate is FINE but he is an arrogant a$$hole. 


Alicia Keys DOES I repeat DOES have a boyfriend, whether or not it's a cover-up, I don't know but the both of them seem really serious about each other, so I doubt it..By the way she is NOT 22, she's 26...


Kelis is NOT 23 she's 28...You can even look it up yourselves, she graduated from her high school class of '92


Nas is one of the coolest mofo's in the industry. He doesn't socialize with everybody (which I can 't blame him for) but he has to be one of thee most laid back people I know. One problem though, he 's just a weed and dust addict.


Kelly Rowland is a nice person, but I think she's a lesbian. Michelle Williams is extremely skinny and she has serious self-esteem problems. 


Mark Wahlberg aka Marky Mark has a huge d *ck for a white boy..I've seen it. I also heard that Brandy has a funky cooch..don't know how true this is.


Also...


Serena has dated Keyshawn Johnson, Corey Maggette and a couple of other no name athletes....word on the street is they all talk about how fine she is, but how bad she smells during sex .


Beyonce is not innocent - she had an abortion at age 18. She was pregnant by her ex, Lindell who resides in Houston, TX. Laker player, Rick Fox and wife, Vanessa Williams are both infected with herpes .. She contracted it from her ex-hubby which was one of the reasons they split. Somehow Rick didn't care and married her for love anyway. They have one child named Sasha together, who she delivered through c-section..


Shhhhhh..........Halle's no good in bed. She refuses to give ""brain"" and when she does she's lousy. Ms. Berry acts too good now, but back in her Jungle Fever days she was boning both Wesley and Spike...........Wesley beat her when he found out(not Christopher Williams folks) and she is deaf in her left ear because of the beating. 


Loon has a male lover. Yes. Mr. Loon prefers to be on the bottom and hopes this secret never gets out.


The same goes for Farnsworth Bentley, but you already knew that...


Mya gets around. Ever wonder why such a pretty girl is single in the industry...well hold on to your hats for this cause here's her ""hit"" list...Jay-Z, Damon Dash, Sisqo, 50 Cent, Just Blaze, Silk tha Shocker, and Lil X (the video director)....I hear she stooped even lower and has added Lil' John to the list.


Wingo from Jagged Edge is a weed addict, he loves strip joints and taking exstacy. His shower has hair all in it and he is having sex with his cleaning lady/interior decorator, who is 40 years old.


Alot of them Lakers are cheats I know first hand. I'll tell you a secret Iknow....Shaq has a mistress in Dallas, TX. He bought her a house and he spends his time with her when he is in town. He called up one of the stations one time and asked if he could dedicate ""Piece Of My Love"" by Guy to her. (off air, of course).


Allen Iverson is rude.....he told ""us"" he hated white girls and refused to tip one at the strip club one night hanging. Tyrese has white bumps on his d*ck. A female voluntarily told me she had sex with him and saw it.


DMX isn't the only one smoking crack rock .....(drum roll) his wife does it too....


Mr. Irv Gotti was caught by his wife at a hotel a couple years ago with a groupie. She banged on the door and beat him down and was arrested for it, but her dumb butt went back to him anyway . He is still with the groupie till this day."

"event","I have a small manga collection, compared to most anime fans but it's growing. I currently have on my shelf:
1. Ranma 1/2 (volumes 1-13)
2. Chobits (Volume 1)
3. Gundam Wing (volumes 1-2)
4. Evil's Return (volume 1)
5. Alice 19th (volume 1-5)
6. Mermaid's Saga (volume 1-3)
7. aaaaaaaaand...... Imadoki! Nowadays (volume 1-2 and growing)


<img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591164699.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg"">

Imadoki (in english it means ""nowadays"") is a cute little school drama by Yuu Watase (she made the famous Fushigi Yuugi). It's in no way fantasy like her other mangas which makes it more interesting and it shows how talented she is that she can create more diverse mangas. 

Anyway, Imadoki is about a girl named Tanpopo (weird) from Hokkaido who gets accepted to an elite, rich school filled with snobby preps. She's one of few who got in because of good grades - the others used influence and money. She developes a love interest early in the story and it just so happens to be the riches and most popular guy in school, Koki. The story goes on from there and it's Tanpopo's mission to make friends in a school full of losers and get the cute guy to notice her.

Yea, it sounds VERY basic and uninteresting doesn't it. But that is how a lot of anime/manga are. When you try and explain it to someone else it always sounds that way. You just have to take there word for it and try it. Imadoki reminds me a little like Napoleon Dynamite - where the ""nerd"" is made the hero while the ""popular"" people are made the dorks. 

I have 2 complaints though: Character development is not that strong (except for Tanpopo, her character is excellent). Yuu Watse is known for making strong side characters and I was looking forward to that. The other reason is that there are a lot of cultural jokes and unless you are japanese you are not gonna understand them. And that's fine, I like culture joke so long as there is a ""cultural jokes"" section in the manga somewhere explaining them -  but there isn't any.

I give the manga * * * * stars (so far, it might get better)"

Wow, no wonder everyone is like, ""blog this"" and ""blog that"". I can sense a new addiction coming along.
Here is a little about me before I get started:

My name is Lauren Edwards (Full name: Lauren Catherine Edwards-Johnson.... divorce is a biotch)
I'm a fabulous 21 (legal, yes!)
College Student - Howard University (changed my major 3 times.... I've NEVER gettin' outta here)
I like Tira Misu (and chocolate)
An Otaku (anime fan)
Sarcastic
I like piercings
Not single (I have a future husband, even though he hasn't proposed yet, hehehe)

$$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$     $$$$$

Most of my blogging will be about three things: School, Anime, and any current project to change my mind body and soul (piercings, hair color, travel, etc.....)
I don't talk about my love life - it's personal to me. There are few friends I talk about that to. Everything else you may find on here. Politics may even creep its way on this blog (I'm a political science major AND a liberal - dangerous mix)

Well this just about ends my first blog enter. Blogging is weird -  I feel like I am talking to myself. No wonder I never kept a diary. Let me get back to work - or find a quiz to post here, whichever comes first!

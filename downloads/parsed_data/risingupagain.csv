Here I am sitting in my cousin's apartment,&nbsp;enjoying some bread and excessively salty cheeze, chilling in my new exotic designer jeans, waiting for his coworke'rs niece to pick me up for more shopping and sightseeing.&nbsp; Today I attempted to do some laundry: what a mistake. to begin with, it took me 45 minutes and two dictionaries to figure out that I'm supposed to set the damn machine to ""Sensitive"" and then hope it wont fuck up my brights with hot water. What else... aone I've successfully bought bread, crossed the Marmara sea twice on ferries, and&nbsp; taken a dolmush down to Taksim square. Looks like i'm getting a little better at being turkish. and I've only got three weeks left here..."

A little voice inside my head said, ""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but-

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
And I cant tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


ahhh i love that song more than...... more than pie!!!!!!! and i loove pie!!!! the 4th was sweeet, some friends and i went paintballing out in mission viejo in the middle of the night, so sweet. I of course had the badass gun with not one, but two types of laser sights and an enormous 200 round hopper yessss... now i need to get caught back up on work! yikes! too much play not enough work, also i havent been around a computer for a long time so i havent updated this journal for dayyyyys... hmm what happened in the time that has passed? i dont know... you cant look back you can never look back ;) i think i've just been working nonstop and being busy with stupid crap, like listening to my dad insisting that there is no way I can change my brake rotors and pads and i'll HAVE to take it to a ""professional mechanic"" to get that done. i want to see the look on his face when he sees my new performance rotors and pads hehehe. they told me that i was snoring last night! and that they could hear it from the street! ak, i let them know about the monster who follows me when i sleep and growls and stuff while i'm asleep... they think its snoring... *sigh* feels like life is boring again. theres nothing driving me... i want a dog.

yeah umm.. the concert was FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!! oh oh oh, there were like 10 people at the whole concert wearing straw hats, and during the Foo Fighter's set one of the hats got up on the stage. Dave Grohl picked it up and was like ""Whoever wore this hat here is a loser!!"" and of course that made us laugh hysterically... yeah all of steve's directions were wrong. he gave us the wrong directions to the airport, then when we got there, he gave us the wrong directions to the hotel, then he told us it would take about 2 hours to get to the concert grounds with traffic. it took 15 minutes so we got there hella early, but we convinced the security that we were with the foo fighters so we hung out in the back in the shade with all the security peeps. yeah the show kicked ass, other than the near-panic attack i had when Davey's voice gave out on him during Totalimmortal (sooo funny...) and i thought that they may end the set early. nope didnt happen, Davey is a tough mother f-cker!!! even in vinyl pants... and YES they played This Time Imperfect!!! like for the first time ever live!!! *kicks so much a$$* it was a fine moment. Then Foo Fighters just rocked everything, and at the end Dave Grohl gave props to Havok, and all was well. 

the weekend was bueno on the whole... the 114 degree weather on sunday didnt exactly feel good, but all the bands kinda made up for that. and all the flashing. [hillbilly voice] yup they do things a little differntly in Tucson [/hillbilly voice] lotta titty bein flashed. it was interestin, i swear some of those girls were like 14 and other ones were like 40. there were some not-so-pretty sights. Dave Grohl even started making fun of em :D *he is SO the man!!!* 

but umm yeah i've decided that i dislike Hicks even more than i dislike Hippies. at least hippies are nice to you, hicks gotta drink beer and bump into ya and think that fat chicks can crowd-surf...

hotel room was kick ass though... yes... kick ass. 

now on to the important stuff: Band practice tomorrow with the best band ever!!!! Scott Yanc and his Popular Friends!!! *winks at adam and kellie* okay okay we'll consider another name....

well kids, thats it for now, i've got a dentist appointment bright and early tomorrow.... late!"

prom was a blast!!! ashlie was there and..... goddamn. if i didnt have a prom date i think we should have 'dissapeared.' hmmmm who else was there, Taryn who was a 'little' drunk and stepped on my feet *owwwch* but i promised not to tell. and a buncha other los al peeps. Mandi was there hahahaha oh yeah, and Chelsea and Nicole *bad acting dart* and a fight broke out right infront of me! it was great, a big ol' catfight, two girls, flowers in hand and everything it was hilarious. they were full on on the ground brawling and wrestling and punching eachother. I gotta ask Brandon (who convieniently works at the chevron right next to my mommies' place) what that fight was about, i saw him pull one of the girls off the other...

as the way we left
i can hear you call
from so far away






""You should know that I love you.
We should love like lovers do
And I can't help but fall for you.
Ah honey I'm just a fool,
Now you know""

""Darling, I'll never be true
You see, for so long I was blue""

""(I'm not the only one)""

""And if I hurt, then you will, too.
Ah honey I always lose,
Now you know.""

""Lover, when will you?""

""I'm so afraid that no one cares""

""Lover, can't find you""

""I swear to God don't leave me here""
Now you know
Oh, you know that it can't be
But no one else here really means

(Anything to me)

""If you hurt inside
If you confide in me again""

""Since you ran away
Hold me now, tell me how...""
Love is ours





~.. for this guilt."

I was just home for all of an hour (or maybe less) to clean my room really quick and get going again, and still as always, show up <I> sorta</I> late to shane's show. Twas still a good show, good energy n' sound mixin n' stuff. sorta motivates me to *thinking* oh thats right, maybe have a complete song! our song kicks soooo much ass, the hardcore song... yes i MUST remember the chorus we came up with D, *thinking* umm... 8? 10? whatever i'll figure it out... 

yeah im at kellies right now *shout out yo! kellie!* because.... i feel like i've neglected this journal. I spent the night out at friends' houses since....i think wednesday. yeah wednesday. *yess* its time to go home tonight.... hopefully... anyways 

our song is so damn catchy! i cant get it out of my head...

ohhhhh almost completely forgot, I'm now a vandal. guilty of breaking *snicker* and entering. yeah... and stealing from old dead people. last night was cool, but scary as f-ck at the same time, we broke into some old abandoned ghost house in seal and freeek looted and pillaged the place looking for money. hilarious, he found like $5 in change and went nuts ""look guys! money! weeeee!!!!"" *shakes head* and then i used my awesome skills of destroying stuff to break locked doors and get us a <I> pad </I> so yes, bed at 6am, getup call at 10am *smacks head on desk* i'm soooooooo tired!

and i'm kinda shocked, i got a sunburn today... bad. I cant belive it, i <I> never </I> burn!!!!!! i tan!!!! well not today, Jeff and I rode bicycles to the beach (yes a long f-cking way!!!) and now my legs are dead, i weigh a little bit less, i'm burnt... but i'm looking <I> much </I> better ;).

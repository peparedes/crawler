"event","Have you ever gotten that feeling where u know that someone or something is right?  That feeling brings butterflies into my stomach.  Wow...where to begin...mike (lil mike), he is nothing people say he is! If people only got to know the real him, his goals and dreams, none of the other stuff would matter.  It still hasn't hit me...I'm talking to mike, the mike I never even thought I would have a chance with!  It's different with mike...whenever I see him, I get this weird feeling in the pitt of my stomach...its hard to explain, but I can say that I can't tell myself what or how to feel.  I don't know where or how far this thing with mike will go, but it doesn't matter because, no matter what happens...whether we're together or not, I can talk to him about anything. He already knows how I feel about him, and he's not gonna ""TOY"" with my feelings. Whatever happens happens...right mike.  I Love you too! *muah* Love Always, Drea
P.S. Drake726: i love you andrea
Drake726: everything about you
Drake726: really...I just cant explain ""that feeling"""

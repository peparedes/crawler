     yea, I wish a certain guy still did those things. *sigh* Lifes mean. Loves the meanest though. Grr..... You know what really sucks, is being in love with someone, STILL, even after they break your heart and treat you like shit, and knowing that you'll probably never be as happy with anyone else as you were with that one person. Even when you were unhappy, and wanted to kill them, through it all, you still loved them, and stuck by their side. And what do they do to you? Break your heart. Make you feel even more like shit than you already did before. Rub it in your face that they are happier with some bimbo than with you. Why? Because they will never, ever truely understand what it means to be in love and to love someone. Real love, now thats a very rare thing. And not too many people are lucky enough to find it. But you know what, real love is what I feel for him. And he might not realize this now, but one day, he'll figure it out. He'll realize that no one, NO ONE could EVER love him as much as I do. And truely mean it with all their heart and soul. Because no one will ever love him for who he is. Love him for just being himself. I mean, I know people make mistakes. But is anyone else going to actually forgive him for those mistakes? No. I think not. If you truely love someone, you can forgive them for anything and everything they've ever done to hurt you. Then, once its all over with, you'll look them in the eyes and still be able to say ""I love you"". Now its great that HE has someone who feels that way about him. But this is what sucks ass. He doesnt feel that way about me. Atleast I dont think he does. Hes probably far past being over me. And thats fine. If thats what he wants, thats fine. He's the dumbass here. Not me. I realized along tiem ago what I had, and eventually he will aswell. Only I have a feeling he's going to realize it a little bit too late. Because you see, theres this other guy, he's been like head over heels in love with me since the 5th grade. We dated for awhile, but he blew it. I believe in second chances, so lately Ive been talking to him, and Ive thought about giving him another chance simple because I know how he feels. He feels the way about me, as I do towards jesse. Now its unfortunate that two people cant just feel the same way about eachother but lifes not fair. So Im wondering if maybe I should just give up on jesse because we all know hes moved on and I should to whether I want to or not. Because I know, if I were this ""other guy"" I'd want a second chance. And he keeps bugging me about it but I dont think it'd be fair to be with him when Im still very much in love with someone else. No one could ever guess who that someone else is though lmao.This one will throw you for a loop. But those of you who knew me last year should know exactly what Im talking about here. Anywho... tomorrows the big day at the doctors. I feel ashamed of myself. Im doing this for jesse. Not for me. Because I know he wants nothing to do with me or a baby. But, after all Ive already done for him, and he still went and broke my heart. So Im wondering if maybe I shouldnt do it. I mean, maybe everyones right. Maybe jesse doesnt deserve for me to do such a horrible thing just because I love him. He doesnt love me. So why should I go against my own morals for him right? I mean. We're talking about another human life here. One of God's creations. Thats a sin. Its a sin and its just plain wrong. I mean, I was ready to have sex with him so I mean, I should own up to this mistake. I dont know. We'll see how things go at the doctors tomorrow morning. ugh..  *screams* I hate my life and I hate guys.

I cant believe HIM. what an asshole. after all the shit he's put me through, all I put up with, all those times I WAS there for HIM. and this is what I get. he needs to pull his head outa his ass, and start caring about someone besides himself.  Im soooo sick and tired of being treated like shit... I was there for him when he went through that whole court thing and everything else he's ever needed me for and the one, the ONE fucking time I need him to be here for me and no...he's to busy with his new girlfriend and fucking around with his friends to give a shit.  so fuck him and his egotistical self.

"event","yea...so Ive come to the conclusion that I suck at life... Jesse and I broke up. I still cant look at him without having to hold back tears... I really do love him. I wish he'd realize that. I wish we were still together, but no. I suck at life. I miss him..... uhg..... and right now, Im sitting here, fucking drunk off my ass at tinas house, Im surprised I can still type.. why I decided to drink tonight, I dunno. I dont know what the fucks going on anymore, I lost the love of my life, my brothers all fucked over, my dads being an asshole, my sister might be getting my neice taking away..... life sucks...and the fact that I cant even get drunk enough to keep myself from thinking about jesse is fucking sad.... just..plain pathetic. everyone keeps saying ""just get over him, move on, he was just using you, he never loved you"" blah blah blah... and hes probably out there with all these other chicks, flirting around and having fun while Im sitting here typing this bullshit fucking drunk out of my mind.... 2 dozen things of smirnoff, 5 shots of tequilla, 7 white russians, 2 bloddy marys, and I can still type. damn Im good. Havent even puked yet. house full of guys that I could easily have, but no... I keep turning people down b/c I want jesse... even though he doesnt want me and is probably way over me and is already thinking of dating someone else, which sucks ass... I hate my life right now....  I cant believe Im even typing all this.. and the suckiest part is that with jesse, yea..might be a problem considering Ive been puking evry morning and craving foods I never eat, and Ive gained 15 pnds in the past two weeks...doesnt seem good. but Im going to see the gyno next week so we'll see..... she said that its possible to have your period atleast once the first month of pregnacy depending on the woman, watch, my luck, I'll be pregnant with his kid, after we broke up and all. ugh... shoot me now... oh shit,,,he's probaly going to read this, if he evern still readys thsi anymore, oops,. theres goes my typing, alvohol kicking in...motherfucker... I should go out there and socialize and be my normal happy self now I guess...someones calling my name... I thinks its either keller or andrew,,ugh...people...sfhfsdx cf skc fuck me... *bang* Im dead.... shot in the head, heart bleeding chest open on the floor... fuck, I have to work tomorrow morning...fucking, sundays... ugh.... hangovers....Im screwed... fucking...fhaeihfai.sf  .... I hate guys... they all lie...fucking... I should have never started drinking tonight..I was doing so good... almost 7 months without it..... kinda... damn. I suck.../ I guess I understand why we broke up... Im ""clingy"". fuck that. godforbid if I love someone and want to be with them all the time... thats love for ya.. fucking a man... I hate being drunk...what was I thinking... Im slowly losing it... not good.. and Im about to go drink more.. but I guess just this one night isnt that bad after going so long without it. I needed it... after this month of hell,, and then the jesse thing...jesus christ shoot me know... I mean... jc ...fuck... Im gone...I wish I didnt love him though,, maybe it wouldnt hurt as bad....i hate guys..i hate my liuck and my choice of guys, its like i attract the heartbreakers..fucking grr...Im out..."

"event","I FINALLY GOT MY MSI TICKET TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! iM JUST A TAD BIT EXCITED, CAN YA TELL? lol. so I'll be at the concert sunday, with steph and whoever else is going. I know of some other people who are also going and I want to see while we are all there.. like scott, kristina, michael, travis, andy, ashland, TJ,billy, and chris (who needs to stop callng me when he KNOWS Im somewhere with JESSE). 

Today was an alright day. I never did get to see Jillian b/c her mom STILL isnt home. But, I got to spend some tiem with my love. and then chris stopepd by my house once I was back home, he just left. I know I probably shouldnt be hanging out with him and all. And being as close of friends as we are.. because he hates Jesse, and Jesse hates him. and they both feel the same way about me, but, Im only dating one of them. the only difference with chris and I is that we never argue,. but, I def. DONT feel the same way about him as I used to. so... that part doesnt matter. Im not sure what Im rambling on and on about here exactly, but the point is. Im with Jesse now, so I should stop hanging out with chris b/c if I keep this up Im afraid something might happen. especially since I know he doesnt want to JUSt be friends..b/c guys are pigs. but still, I lovers him to death, hes a sweet guy. and some other stuff but yea..hes goign to get me in trouble with jesse soon so I should stop hanging out with him, alone anyways. b/c things only happen when ppl are alone in situations like that. so yea.. no more alone time with him. def not. 

tomorrow is adrians last day at the church, I hope I get the job. But for some reason I have a really bad feeling about that. which means I probably wont get it. that sucks. ALOT! I really do need a job, of any sort.. and that way I wont be at my dads every other weekend anymore. THANK GOD! BUT, thats only if I can get a job.

oh yeah, and ahm...still not bleeding..getting worried. damn my vagina and its stubborness to bleed for me. only a real woman PRAYS TO GOD that she starts her period soon lol, as my phyc. says. 

people are A-holes. why cant ppl just be nice and cheerful>? oh fuck me, who am I to ask that LOL, I fucking hate almost everybody. so if I dont hate you, you BEST for EXTREMELY loved. 

school tomorrow, eh.... so much credit to finish making up before this school year ends. AHH! sooooooo much work to do.... ugh.....fucking hate the school board..lost all my fucking credit over the summer that I made up . had to start ALLLLLLL over. fuck them!

MSI ON THE 24th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh I cant wait. havent been to a concert since well....hmm... over the summer? yea.. YAY! I get to dress up and look all sexy and goth like, even though Im not goth lol. but, w/e I get to be sexy for once and act fucking retarded. YAY! 

soooo...anywho, yea. life is silly. I dont know why but Im in a really good mood right now, Im sure that will all change when I call jesse later tonight, how much you wanna bet we argue some more? I bet we will, over something stupid probably, ugh..*sigh* I hate arguing. I try to avoid it but Im so fucking stubborn sometimes, and so is he. damn us both. two stubborn people should NOT be dating. but it works. I lvoe him, so eh..w/e

I hate when shit like this happens. she better pay me back damnt. grr... *angry eyebrows*

yesertday was fun. went and saw Amityville Horror with Jesse. It was our 4 month thingy . how exciting. he was a jerk most of the time, up until we got back to his house. but, w/e. he's just PMSing.. b/c I know Im not. Although I should be. But no. No period in how long now? hmm..... 3 months. YEA. 3 months and still no period. starting to freak. I mean, mine are usually irregular anyways, but Im still worried. Even though its gone 3 1/2 months without it before... with all thats been going on, and my sucky luck, Im getting worried. But I dont want to tell Jesse that b/c I dont want him freaking out. He doesnt need that right now. So someoen, please...AFTER the MSI show, shoot me. lol. Im ALMOST positive that I have nothing to worry about..but I want to know for a fact. which is why I need to either start bleeding right fucking now, OR, I need to see my doctor and have them check things out. wow, that was probably alot of shit none of you needed to read about lol. 

ahmm... other news... we sold another puppy. 5 down and 2 to go. *tear* I want to keep one. But if anyone wants one, clal me. PLEASE! Im tired of them being in my bathroom lol. I think my moms selling them for like $300 or something liek that. We have two boys left. they are so cute I want one so bad...but we already have one of those dogs, being the mother ofcourse...

so ahm..err...yea.. I need to call Ty and make his ass bring meh back my guitar.. I miss it. Although I think Ty left it at Nicks house, buttface.. grr...on Nick. Not Ty. I miss him, what a sweetie, I should call him later and see if he wants to hang out.. He keeps bugging meh about it and I keep forgetting. grr...

I need new friends. And a new personality, b/c mine sucks ass. And by new friends, I mean, other than people like Jill, Erika, Jodi, Shannon, Jenni, Ty, Nick H., Nick,Jesse, Ashland, Matt, David, James,Scott, Chris, Steph, and Nikki. All my other so-called ""friends"", yea... *cough*...they need to go. Like, now.  Dear lord do I need new friends... eh.. *spits at those non-friendly people*

I hate boys.....and boy problems.. Jesse and I are still arguing. But not as much. His wishes were to not see meh as much as he has been. What the fuck kind of bf tells you that? Jesse, thats who. He's lucky I love him, anyother guy I would have dumped by now. Along time ago. But he's pissing meh off. He just doesnt get it. ANY OF IT! The whole point of a relationship. He doesnt get it. I mean, fuck, Danney..the first thing he complains about to meh is that he never gets to see sarah. He said he would KILL to see her and spend as much time with her, as Jesse does with meh. But no. Jesse doesnt care. Who teh fuck gets tired of being abe to spend time with their gf or bf? Thats just fucked up. He's lucky no one better has come along, YET! And if that opportunity comes along, I will tell him ""c-ya later buck-o, YOU are the one who fucked up and decided to be a jerk"". ugh..boy problems. I feel like such a bicth complaining about this shit. But allswell... who cares... Im not forcing any of you to read this. So if you dont like hearing about it.. you can fuck off! (unless you are loved by meh, than just skip this part lol)

I finally made an appointment to go get my drivers license. YAY! Although my appointment isnt until May 27th. How lame. Too long to wait. I BETTER pass it the first time for that long ass of a wait damnt. And I hope I'll have a car to use for the test by then b/c I cant use my moms or my step dads truck. Maybe my father will let me have his car that weekend b/c I drive his car ALL the time. Back and forth to and form Orlando.. so much fun. God I love driving. Im such a loser. 

Our church is going to a concert at Cornerstone in Orlando or w/e May 13th-14th. As I lay dying will be there, and all those other bands. YIPEE KI YAY MOTHAFUCKA! I BETTER be able to go. And if not with the church, I still better be able to go damnt. ugh... I'll be so pissed off if I cant. 

Jobs...work....eh..the horror... I still need a job! HELP MEH OUT HERE PPL!!!! I hope I get that job at the church, but then again, I dont..b/c I dont think I'll get it anyways, AND! I want more of like a normal average job, like at a store or something. The job Id have at the church isnt that. Its more liek, me doing everything alone..all the time. By myself.BORING! And lonely. I wouldnt like that. Eh... but then again, I dont always like people, so it might work out. Who knows..Im so fucking picky I hate it. SOmeoen just fucking shoot meh in the ehad, please. right fucking now. just BANG! Im dead. DO IT! NOW! I order you to do it!

JESSE. if you dont wanna hear this bullshit skip reading this next paragraph lol... I dont think he also realizes that once I have a job, AND a car, and I start hanging out with more of my friends and not spending time wiht him all the time (like he wants) that he will never see me. outside of school. like, thats it. once I start hanging out with my friends again like I used to, it'll just get to the point that I will stop making time for him..not on purpose though, thats just what happens, doesnt mater who the guy is Im dating. it always happens. but if thats what he wants then fine. but that, plus me working, and me having a car. Im never going to be home, and never going to be ""not busy"". So, hes just turning our relationship into shit by dong this. but whatever, aslong as HE is happy, then...whatfuckingever. right?

wow, all together this entry is like a fucking essay. lol. how silly of meh. I should stop bitching about everything and just write entries like ""omfg i lvoe meh life, and friends and family and everything and everyone and oh yea... i love you...bye"" I should make entries like that. informing you all of the same fucking thing, over and over and over again. or maybe not. maybe I'll stick to normal long ass drawn out entries informing you all of my everyday sucky ass life. that is SOMETIMES wonderful. very rarely though. but it does happen. hmm.... tired of typing now...go figure..

friends. lately, all of mine are not being too good of friends.but I still love them.

boyfriends. well, at the moment, mines acting strange. I seriously think that he's either not telling meh something, cheating on meh, or just seriously up to something. I dont know. maybe its just meh. but I know one thing for a fact. he's lost his mind. he's acting like, well... kinda selfish in the relationship I guess you could say. its like he thinks no matter what he does, that I'll never leave him. well, *cough* he should know that if he keeps this whole thing up... and that if he EVER crosses the line, I will dump his ass in a heartbeat. not to sound heartless, but its true. I will not tolerate certain things. and HE KNOWS THAT! So why is he acting like he is?  he must not care anymore. which, if he doesnt, and if he IS losing feelings for meh, I think I have the right to know. I feel horrible for saying thsi all... but everytime I try to say it to him on the phone or to his face, he pulls that whole guilt trip thing and I cant really explain things. but from now on, thigns WILL change. I will hang up on him if he pisses me off...and I WONT call back. Or answer the phone. I refuse to feel bad about being treated like shit. its like he expects ME to ALWAYS satisfy him, which is fine, I live for that, but umm...eh hmm... when do I get my satisfaction guarenteed part of the deal here? I live to please him, yet, he thinks that theres just no need to please me? am I being selfish about that? I mean, I dont ask for much. Im just one of those g/f's who alwyas needs LOTS of attention from her b/f, and lots of lovings... its not liek I want him to buy me the world..I dont want anything or anyoen , JUST HIM! Is that soo much to ask for? Because if he cant handle this, I know of alot of guys who would LOVE to be a replacement...not saying anything really.. but, i just wish he'd put moe effort into this. i dont know how else to explain all of this. and Im tired of arguing, and tired of being made to feel like shit over some of the things he says and does. And Ive jsut about had it. I mean COME ON! oh wow... Ive posted a huge paragraph on this issue...I think thats enough for tonight.. 

new topic... I get to see Tina on Friday! yay! I havent seen her in forever. I miss her. *sigh* good times..good times... I hope she doesnt cancel on me...

"event","oh my frik'n God. I just showed my family here at my fathers house a buncha Happy Tree Friends episodes and now they all think I need serious mental help. My dads like, ""OH MY GOD! how could you watch that crap, and laugh about it while your watching it, and sing along?"" lol. I was like,""umm...well... its funny."" So then I showed them Foamy the Squirrel. lol, that went over well. See, now, my mom would love both of them. She would laugh her ass off, almost literally. But my father...oh noooo. He flipps out. lol. oh no! they're killing eachother and showing blood and guts, ON A CARTOON! I seriously am starting to think that they got me mixed up. Like my mother had a sperm doner. Because the only thing mm father and I have in common is our DNA and the fact that we have a similar resemblence to one another. THATS IT! Now, my mother and I look NOTHING alike, but have WAY MORE in common. Although sometimes its hard to tell when we're always arguing and bickering over nothing. But still. You get the point. 

Other news... I completely forgot about daylight savings. SO instead of waking up at 10:30 like I thought I was, I was waking up at 11:30. But thank God for my cell phone setting the time on its own, otherwise Id still be behind. God I love technology. Id be lost without it. 

I get to come back to Merritt Island tonight. YAY! And then go back to school tomorrow. How exciting.. but atleast I get to see JESSE. 

I'm a horrible girlfriend. Ive come to realize that. I feel horrible. Ive made JESSE cry over something Ive said more times than Ive cried in the past year almost. He's made me cry ONCE. And thats only because I was so worried about him and his whole court thing. Not really his fault. So there ya go. Im a horrible girlfriend and JESSE deserves much MUCH better. I only wish I could give him the best. Like I told JESSE lastnight, things would be so much better if I were like the perfect girlfriend, the perfect daughter, the perfect student, the perfect sister, the perfect friend, the perfect..everything. But no. Im the complete opposite when it comes to all of those things. Which sucks major ass. I wish so badly that I could give JESSE the world. Give him my everything. And so much more. Because he deserves so much more than I have to offer. And Im sorry for that. But theres not much I can do about it. Im working on changing what I can about myself though. So hopefully that will work.

"event","I cant believe this, I think JESSE and I are losing are whole like ""lust"" thing for eachother. I know it sounds crazy, but thats all Ive been able to think  about. I mean..even after we...ya know.. earlier today, I couldnt stop thinking about it. I mean..we used to like always talk about everything, literaly, even the stupid shit. And we'd laugh about every stupid thing we said. Now its like we never really talk at all. When we're with eachother we're either having sex or too tired to do anything at all, unless its the mall. Which is getting so lame. I hate it. And then, on the phone, the only things said are me-""So...yea."" Jesse- ""yea... sooo..."". Me- ""well..umm... hmm..."" Jesse- ""yea...well, Im tired babe so Im going to bed alright?"" me- ""alright..well..*sigh*"" Jesse- ""goodnight..I lvoe you.."" me- ""Night, *deeeeep sigh* I love you too.. mer... "" and thats it. thats our entire convo. How sad is that. Its like, I dont even feel all ""butterflies in teh tummy"" whenever he touches me, or calls, or says I love you anymore. And I dont like it. It feels like the excitement is all gone and now it feels like hes only with me because he's being forced into somehow. I dont know how to explain it. But it sucks major donkey shit. I hate ti sooo much. I even staretd crying after we got off the phoen earlier too. Yea...me. Crying. Over a boy. Go figure.. Whatever has changed between him and I needs to stop changing and go back to the way things were before. *sigh* I love him so much.. I dont want to do something stupid liek ""take a break"" and risk the chance of losing him forever. And he always seems so unhappy when we're together.. its odd. But then he seems just fine around everyone else. If hes so unhappy, why doesnt he just leave me. I mean...its that simple. Not happy..leave. Problem solved. Right? Unless its me thats unhappy. Maybe its just because of the way things have been lately, and not being able to see him as much, and having to leave AGAIN this weekend. I fucking hate my father. ..... well.... I gues sthe only good news I have tonight is that Jesse and I finally picked out a song for us. Its Atreyu's ""This Flesh A Tomb"".. read the lyrics...

Atreyu-This Flesh A Tomb

I feel eyelashes on my cheek
And they lacerate my flesh
A pain so good
Put your hand in mine
Never let go
Never wake up 'cause I'm done with promises
I'm taking blood oaths
Feels likes you could kiss my imperfections
My imperfections away
And I would stand
Stand by your side until the sun turns the sky
All the colors I see in your eyes

I'll never need to see the sun again
There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world
So take me, take my away
Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

I swear to you, on everything I am
And I dedicare to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side
Forever and always until the day I die

The bite marks on my neck never felt so good
I'm losing control and it's all that I can do
Not to blackout and fall into lust with you
Your kisses infect me
The dark gift is loving you

And I feel immortal and I want to make you feel the same
So stand by me as we immulate
We can burn in each other's arms

exciting huh/......yea...'nite kids.

~peace"

"event","well, so far spring break has been sucky and relaxing, the only NON sucky parts have been when I get to see JESSE, my love. But, its still all good. I need some relaxing anyways. One of the puppies got hurt yesterday and had to go to the vet. I was so upset and nervous about its poor health I literally threw up in the vets office. Our other dog attacked the por little thing over a fucking biscuit. How dumb. It ended up with a scratch on its eyeball and the left side of its jaw broken. Its horrible. SO now its all on meds and in its own little pin. I feel so bad for it. *tear* I hate when animals get hurt. I hate seeing them hurt. Thats why I can never be a vet, Id love to help them, but itd break my heart too much to see it. But besides THAT puppy, we sold my favorite one of them all today, my little Buttercup. She was sooo adorable. She always just sat there and stared at everyone. Never payed with her brothers and sisters. Just sat ther, like me. It was great. And she didnt shit everywhere. lol. 

Besides all of that, my hosue phone is fucked up, so if you need me, call my cell. I just paid off the minutes so its all gravy baby! Today I was watching Just Married and it reminded me of JESSE and myself for some reason. Like if we ever were to get married (which I would love because Im so deeply in love with him I could just cry right now) but if we ever were to marry, I could see us doing all of that. Us both fucking up. Trying to have sex in the air plane bathroom and shit. lol, hhis foot getting stuck in teh toilet from it LOL. Us arguing over nothing, and then apologizing instantly for it . Our my family and our friends trying to fuck things up for us. Kinda. The whole thing with Ashton K. telling the guy off and getting them kicked out of the 5 star hotel. Us getting into a huge fight and going off on our own during the honey moon, and then something happenign to where I think he cheated on me and him thinking stuff about me and another guy and getting all paranoid and shit. And just, the whole movie would be us if we got married. Because after all of that shit, in the end, they stay together forever and longer and still lvoe eachother just as much as they did when they first set eyes on eachother. Now I know that all sounds very mooshy, but ya know what. For once, I dont care about being TOO mooshy. I love him, so, whatev- lol, and JESSE, if you're reading this, dont get freaked out by this alright. Im not saying LETS GO GET MARRIED or anything lol, Im just saying, I could see myself spending the rest of my life with you, and loving every minute of it. No matter what happens or what stupid arguments we have. We'l get through it. Just liek this whole spring break thing. We'll get through it. And Im sure the time will come for us when we get to spend just as much time together as we would be right now. So, no worries. And yes, my mother did tell me you said I was ""bitching"" at you b/c of you working so much this week. And Im sorry if I have, I dont mean to. I just cant stand beign away from you like this, and only getting to see you for liek 5 mins in the mornign, 30 at noonish, and then until 7 once you're off work. But its alright, its better than nothing. I'll deal with it. Because I love you. So dont stress about it babe. Its all gravy right? So you better be smiling while you're reading this.. SMILE!!! I bet you are right now. lol. 

Alright, well...anywho, tomorrows a new day, and I'll get to see JESSE, not for long, but its still nice. And more relaxing, hopefully I'll get out of the house for once... finally. I hope... *sigh* 

I love you Buttercup!!! <3 <3 <3 <3

"event","It easter sunday. how fucking exciting is that?! *cough* NOT! I seriously fucking hate this day. It revolves around a fucking bunny. what sense does that make. I think the person that came up with this fucking thing needs to be resurected and fucking kileld again. just shot dead certain in the face. chopped into pieces, and then put into little easter eggs and hidden for the little children to find. now THAT my friend, is what I call a holiday worth celebrating!!!! 

my so-called father type person is making me celebrate today. soo... heres my celebration for all *says ""hurray"" in a low monotone voice* .... yup, there ya go.. *raises bottle of vodka to concur with self in this celebration of retardedness*

soo...my ""dad"" will be dragging me off to have brunch with a buncha people I hate and whom half of I have never met before in my life...then we're having a huge dinner here at the house... the only exciting part about THAT is that I get to eat.... alot...... and then eat dessert. yummy-goodness style baby! but its nothing special, I just ate a huge slice of red velvet cake for breakfast so...eh... so long as Im home tonight by like 8, I'll be happy.


but to all of you who DO love easter and celebrate it, happy fucking bunny day to you!

"event","well.... today has been blah as usual. my dad didnt end up picking me up until like almost noon. then we went to lunch with chris, adam, and sam. It was nice. Ive missed  Sam soooo much.. *sigh* He couldnt believe that I was 17 now. I havent seen him in like, a decade. God I love him. He's awesome. Now... now Im sitting here at my dads house, doing nothing. I think they are wanting to go shopping later on. Or see a movie or something. Exciting? I think not. 

Other than that... I miss JESSE. He's off at the mall, having fun without me. I mean, Im glad he's having fun. But I wish I were there. And I hate to say this but, after his first strike..and the whole, staring at his EX GIRLFRIEND Nikki's boobs, I dont have THAT much trust in him. I mean, I want to trust him with everything I have, but I just cant. I dont know why. I have like this gut feeling that he's going to do something to hurt me. And I hate it. Because I know he'd never hurt me, on purpose. But, shit happens. So he cant say that he wont. I mean hell theres always a chance of me hurting him by cheating on him, or just like up and breaking up with him. But it doesnt meaqn Im going to. And I dont want to. Im not planning on it, EVER! But, shit DOES happen, so...eh.. 

Easter. I fucking HATE easter. with more than JUST a passion. like, seriously. All it reminds me of is two people who are no longer able to spend easter with us. Every easter we used to go visit my grandmother. Itd be me, my dad, my lil'sister, and my brother Darryl all in the car. My Grandmother used to call me her little angel baby. And Darryl used to call me chikaboosha. Or chikaboo for short. (chik-a-boo-sha) No. Its not Portuguesse. Just a random thing he used to call me. Long story. But, I now fucking hate easter because my Grandmother died of lung cancer from smoking for so many years when I was only in like 5th or 6th grade. And then my brother Darryl killed himself when I was in 8th grade. So yea... easter sucks. It used to be the only holiday that our family never argued during.  *deeeeeep sigh* I hate people. My dads trying to make me celebrate easter this year (tomorrow) by going to some fucking family lunch/dinner tradition he seems to have started a few years ago. This is the first year Ive ever been with my father for easter since Darryls funeral. So its kinda awkward. My dads pretends all year long that he never had a son. As if Darryl just never existed. And my mom, well, the only time I can tell shes thinking about him is when the holidays come around. And this is the first year she'll be without me for easter, so..I hope shes alright tomorrow. 

I'm hungry. I just ate a shit load of food at lunch and Im STILL hungry. I need to stop eating so much. Im going to turn into a sumo or something. My stomaches chubby enough as it is. Fucking food. Why does food have to be so addicting and taste oh-so-very-good? *sad face* And yes, its the first thing I go for when Im depressed lol. Food and candy...lots of candy. Usually white chocolate or something like that. lol. well... now that Ive become even more hungry, I think I shall go stuff my face now..

So he better hope he doesnt fuck up because Im not kidding about this shit. I will leave him if he gets three strikes. Just like that. Up and leave, with no goodbye kiss. No nothing. And sorries wont cut it. So... I hope he knows that. 


Other news.. my so-called father person is picking me up tomorrow morning, at eleven A.M. exactly, as he stated in his voicemail. lol. what a fuck-tard-muffin. I hate him oh-so-very-much, like, with a fucking passion, taped to a brick, stapled to dynamite, after being pushed off of a 500 story building. Yea... I hate him that much. I'd keep going, but that would take forever.. like, eternity. So anywho, this weekend is going to suck major ass crack. God I hate going to visit on the weekends. I'd much , MUCH, rather be HERE, with JESSE. Even if we're jsut sitting there, doing absolutely nothing. At all. I'd love to do that. I wouldnt trade that for the world. But no..ooohhhh NO! I have to go spend time with the fuck face who calls himself a ""father"". Father my ass! And he can kiss my fucking fat ass. *tilts fat ass towards his mouth while grinning*

I got to see my Buttercup today!!!!!!! It was fantastic. Im gonna miss him sooo much this weekend. *sad face* we wnet to the mall, had ""fun"" at my house, lol, played in the rain, went to his house, watched happy tree friends and faomy the squirrel. ate, and now Im home. greatest day ever. *sigh* God I love him.... its sickening. PICAWW!!!! PICAWW MOTHER FUCKERS!!! sorry, random outburst of energy, although Im really fucking tired... *yawn*

*stares at phone* maybe I should call him now....... dot dot dot

*ringing.............. still ringing....* *sad face* my house phones being fucking retarded as cheese. And he's making me wait for him to finish something before he can call me back. how gay. allswell, he's worth the wait... *yawn* ... *stares at phone...*

"event","I fucking HATE guys!!!! They're pigs, if your boyfriend decides to completely check out your BEST FRIEND and EX GIRLFRIEND, he might aswell just fuck her right? I mean, what else would someone be thinking about while checking out their girlfriends best friend? You dont see me going around checking out all of Jesse's friends or anything. But yet, he says ""I dont want to be with anyone else, I just want you Shaunna"" blah blah blah...BULLSHIT! Then why the fuck would he be checking out my best friend? And always making comments about wanting to see her and I ""doing stuff"", because shes MY ex girlfriend. And always making comments about wanting to join in... but only when its with HER! Not a different girl that Ive dated, JUST Suzie. Go figure. I'm not surprised. This is the reason I usually NEVER introduce her to my boyfriends. But, I thought Jesse would be different. I thought I could trust him enough NOT to do this and NOT be like all the other guys Ive dated. But I guess I was wrong. Honestly,. I'd break up with him, but theres no point if all guys are the same right? So I might aswell just accept the fact that he's a pig, like all the others, and that there really never was anything special between us. But as soon as he fucks up and actually DOES what the others did, its over. And by that I mean, in the past, EVERY guy that ended up ""checking out"" one of my best friends, ALWAYS ended up cheating on me with her. So they basically did more than a check out, more like  a full body exam, inside and out. And people wonder why Im so insecure. I dont know, maybe its because almost ALL of the guys Ive dated have cheated on me with one of my best friends. So apparentlty Im just not good enough, or pretty enough, or EASY enough for everyone. And this is why I'm down to only FOUR female friends, and the rest are ALL guys. So.... now that this has happend, I guess I'm just waiting for jesse to cheat on me.. and then it will really be like good ol' times eh? The only part of all of this that sucks is that well..... Im in love with him. And always will be. So either way, Im gonna get hurt. Again. I hope I see him today, but then again, I hope he fucking burns in hell. The fact that I stopped taking my medication really doesnt help him out any lol. I think alot differently, and care alot less, about everything. So right now Im thinking, fuck him, fuck this, and fuck you. Im out~"

well, guess that answers my question about where Im going when I die. lol. Interesting test there guys, you should all try it. But anywho, two bomb threats in one week. FUN! Not.. It was hot out, and I was hungry. But atleast this time I got to sit with JESSE the whole time. AND, Jillian, Erika, and my Nicky Slippy.  Then, get into 6th period and, I get kicked out of class pretty much. The whole class ended up leaving lol. It was great. Right now JESSE's at work, we're talking again. YAY! No more break. That was a stupid idea. I hate myself. I dont know why the fuck I decided to take a ""break"". Thats not what I need, what I need is to know FOR SURE that JESSE and I will be together for forever and longer. I was thinking about that during the bomb threat and kinda freaked myself out with what I came up with as a way to make sure we stay together. Because I dont want to lose him. EVER! He's my everything...and more. *deep sigh* God I love him oh-so-very-much.... 

other news...my mother and Gary might be getting jail time because my dad found out some things and told the judge, which means I can either live with my dad then, or have my mom sign the papers to be amancepaded (spelling? lol).  But then where would I stay? And I'd have to drop out in order to work full time so I could support myself. *sigh* I hate people. Fucking people. They all deserve to be tortured and sent to the 7th level of Hell. lol. But I dont want to spend eternity with them so nevermind. The can just go to Heaven. So long as I dont have to be with them. 

My dads picking me up Saturday morning. I hope I get to spend a shit load of time with my Buttercup tonight and tomorrow. ::sad face:: I'm hoping.... well... anywho, Im out of things to update on I think.. hmm.. so yea, lat~

I love you Buttercup <3 <3 <3 <3

"event","well.... here we are. I havent updated in awhile. Alot of stuff has happend since my last entry. Too much to write though. So in short..here we go

Friday JESSE came over, we snuggled, it was cute. He also went to court earlier that day. He ended up with 40 hours community service, $115
to pay or something like that, and an apology letter to the  bitch. So its not that bad. I was so nervous...all day, until I saw him during 4th period when he got dropped off at school. I was so happy I started crying when he walked away. Steph said I was being a ""girly girl"" lol. Which explains why I have a vagina, right? Thought so. 

Saturday JESSE came over again...duh. We hung out around my house for awhile, then went and saw The Ring Two. It wasnt as good as I thought it'd be. I'm disappointed. Later that night JESSE and I went back to his house. It was such a blast. I've never been such a goofball around a guy before. I love it. I feel so comfortable around him now, its wonderful. We got into a bit of a wrestling thing once all those Santas White Christmas' kicked in that we had at the mall lol. We watched Ace Ventura, and the rest of his baby videos. His parents edittd out the part about his mom asking his dad if he wants a blow job. lol. I love his family. They are such great people. And his mothers the biggest sweetheart ever!!! God I love him... *sigh* 

Sunday JESSE and I hung out, like always. YAY! He's my favorite hobby. lol... We did a whole lot of nothing. Just sat around my house, goofed off. Acted like dorks. Wrestled. I lost. lol. I LET him win though. *snickers* y-e-a.. then later that night his dad picked us up and we went out to dinner with his parents, his brother Jaret, his sister in-law Shawna (she stole my fucking name, but mines spelt cooler lol), and his neice Brianna. It was nice. We went to Olive Garden. We got free desert because one of the waiters dropped our plates when they were bringing us our food. lol. So it worked out. His neice was soooo incrediby adorable. And he looked so happy when he got to hold her. He's such a pansy, I love him oh-so-very-much!!!!! *teehee* After dinner we all went back to their house, his brother and Shawna and the baby left after saying goodbye to evryone. Then JESSE and I ate our deserts, wrestled, and watched a Slipknot DVD. His parents gave him his new PS2. The new like reallllllly thing one. Its not JUST thin, its like fucking tiny as fuck. Its so cute I want one. lol. Then we watched a little tele and then him and his dad drove me home. It was a fanfuckingtastic weekend. 

Monday, yesterday...JESSE's 17th birthday! He wasnt very excited but I was. They were all singing to him at church that night, it was sweet. He made a comment though that changed the rest of this week, and it caused me to think about alot of things. Too many things. But after church I got to play air hockey!!!!!!!!! And I beat JESSE a few times, I dont care what he says, I won! lol. But yea, all that thinking lead into today...soo....

Today, we had a bomb threat at school. Four fucking hours outside in the bleachers. So exciting. I sat with JESSE, Erika, Shannon, Nikki and Jamie the whole time. We had a huge water fight, cheesecake fight, ate two giant bags of chips, and played cards. Well, we played Bullshit. Because we all suck at cards, except for JESSE ofcourse. He rules at everything as usual, and I love it. lol. But, then JESSE came to my house when he got off work and I decided that he and I need to take a break away from eachother so that he can gather his thoughts and everything else, and take the time to appreciate all that he has, talk to some friends he's abandoned, spend time with his family. Something, anything, stop and smell the roses, whatever it takes. I almost thought breaking up would be better because he said theres an empty spot inside of him that just isnt getting filled. And after everything Ive done, I cant do anything else besides love him with all my heart, and if I cant fill the emtiness inside of him than I just dont know what to do. Maybe Im not what he needs right now. So, we're taking a break as of now. Until his emptiness is filled. And if this ""break"" doesnt work, than we'll try something else. But no matter what, I love him, and Im not going anywhere, EVER! I hope he knows that. After he left tonight I did nothing but cry for the longest time until I ran out of tears. Because this break is torture to me aswell. But he needs it. We both do in our own little ways. And he knows it, even if he doesnt want it, he knows he needs it. He's been beyond stressed out. And we've been arguing, and I dont like it. A break will do us some good, ugh... crying again, guess Im done now. I love him sooo much... ugh...I hate myself for doing this... Im gonna miss him so much during this break... grr.... ::deep sigh::

I love you Buttercup <3 <3

"event","well, yesterday was amazing. for many many reasons, some of which lasted longer than others, lol. I got to see my love, alllll day. He came over in the morning, we stayed at my house until about 12 I guess maybe a little later just fucking around and having fun. lol. then we walked up to the mall. that was great. we saw our first movie together (Constantine). great movie by the way! We werent the first ones into the movie so I made sure we were the last ones to leave. Only this couple in the last row just sat there until they turned the lights on so we had to wait for them to leave first, and JESSE wouldnt let me throw my keys, cell phone, or flip-flop at them to make them leave sooner. *teehee*. but thats okay, I still love him, ofcourse, lol. then we did more of that walking around thing. and like every saturday , before the movie, we hung out in journeys and talked to gayland (however you spell his name), and then I saw nikki, she forgot our penguine b/c shes dumb like that. then we went and saw some other people and what not. Erin was stupid and gave JESSE a knife to play with while I was in Barneys. But I made sure he didnt get it again for the rest of the day lol. I had like 2 santas white x-mas's, and a strawberry banana smoothie, lots of sugar. and then.... *deep breath* JESSE's dad picked us up and we went back to his house. We started listenign to music, then watching movies, and somehow ended up watching home videos of JESSE in diapers (soooooo fucking adorable OMFG!) while we were all cuddled up in his bed. it was great. then we had dinner with his parents, his mommy made salmon for me *teehee*, which was really good by the way. I love his mom to death, like seriously, shes so adorable.  And then we were watching part of the hoem video and in it you hear his mom asking his dad while hes video taping if he wants a blow job LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!! He told his parents and showed them the part in the video, omg, you should have seen the look on his mothers face. but shes only human, nothing to be embarressed about. although JESSE freaked out when he first saw it on the tape and had to rewind it and watch it like a trillion times before it realllly sunk in I guess. But atleast he didnt catch his mother and step father having sex, totally naked ofcourse, in the hot tub, when you and your friend erika walk outside... I threw up about five times that night. erika thought i was gonna have a heartattacke and die lol. I almost did. nastiest thing Ive ever seen. worse than davids porn collection. but yea, then we staretd watchign ace ventura (retarded happy dance) and around 10:30 ish his dad took me home. then JESSE called, talked for like 10 mins. and then I went to bed. so yea, that was my excitement for saturday. I loved it. *sigh* god I love that guy.. (JESSE ofcourse), lol.........

but today, today is sunday. boring. so very boring. which is why Im typing so much lol. I wake up at 9:30, walk out in the kitchen, no ""goodmorning sweetie"" from my mom. just a ""bye, we're leaving on your uncle todds boat, be back...whenever....have fun being bored today"". lol. so I made some chocolate milk, turned on the tele out in the FL room and watched my movie, Grind. hehe, makes me want to go skateboard, but Im still not dressed and Im in my lazy mode right now. and probably will be alll day unless I get to see my darling JESSE today. which is doubt I will b/c he has to mow the lawn and clean his room... might take him all day to clean the bathroom lol. eww... gotta love him, such a slob. but anywho... its like  a quarter to 11 and still no call from JESSE. so Im wondering if I should either find something to do with like matt or chris or someone, or just be lazy and sit at home all day. hmm.... maybe I'll wait until 12 and just play on the comp until then. yea.... until noon it is then.... oohh! I found a question thingy on someones lj entry, I have something to do now, Im so incredibly bored out of my mind its sick. very sick.

"event","so yea, bad news. I might have to move in with my dad after I finish the school year. I dont want to say alot about it because its a long story and its depressing.

so anyways, todays friday, finally, YAY! *retarded happy dance with tu-tu on* (spelling?) I get to see JESSE, he gets off of work in about 30 mins. yay! *you know what Im doing lol* , *a happy dance of course, you  pervs!* lol yea today was alright actually, not a whole lot happend, classes, JESSE, classes, JESSE, drama with people and their prob;ems, more JESSE, more classes... that was about it. And now Im home. 

My moms first words to me when I walked in the door today were, ""shaunna! I have a surprise for you and JESSE!"", me-""umm...okay, what?"", mom- ""here, take it."", me- ""mom, you do realize these are condoms right?"", mom- ""yes.. I know. "", me-""and you know his parents have no idea and cant knwo until JESSE is ready to tell them right?"", mom-"" yup, no worries, I just wanted to make sure you guys are safe, because I know you are going to be alone this weekend."", me- ""mom,I love you!!!!!!"". that was our convo, then I went and hid the condoms in my room. lol. that made my day, and saves JESSE some money. she only got us a 12 pack though, so we'll see how long that last. *teehee*

Besides all that, tomorrow is the first saturday Ive been here in merritt island for awhile. I cant wait. see JESSE, go to the mall and see a movie, hopefully, then go back to his house later that night and cuddle in his big comfy water bed... yey!

true fact, more than 55% of mankinds poulation REALLY IS as fucking stupid as people say they are. If not dumber. I find that hilarious. 

the cat ate a bird who climbed up a tree that fell on the man who was feeding the monkey then bled to death while hugging the cat. the end.

squirrel is a tricky word to spell for alot of people apparently. so youre not alone. i took a servay, out of 46 people, 34 of them didnt know how to spell it. thats more than half. funny thing is, I spent an entire class period the other day with the whole class trying to figure out how to spell it. turns out I was spelling it right, but it didnt look like it was. but for those of you who didnt already know how to spell it, its spelt S-Q-U-I-R-R-E-L

JESSE is on his way over from work, he just got off, hes glad he doesnt have to go to the store anymore, lol. i love my mommy. now she just needs to leave the house for the night..lol..but no. *sad face* they are staying home to watch movies tonight. damn them. thats okay. theres always tomorrow. so yea, I'm out~ PEACE

"event","well, umm, yea. my mother came up to me and said that she missed our ""mother-daughter talks"", and so we began talking about how much we hate stupid people and how boring school/work is. and then we stopped for awhile and she went in the computer room to check her mail. so i went in there and sat down next to her and told her that I needed to have a talk with her. i asked her to buy me condoms. lol. I was like, ""you dont want to be a grandmother NOW do you?"" of course she said no, and I was like ""well, birth control doesnt always work by itself so Im going to need them because JESSE and I want to start having sex without having to hide the condoms."" lol. and so she was like, well, thats fine with me, but only if I can talk to one of his parents, either his mom, or dad, or both. I was like , ""NOOOO, NOT his mom. that'll break her heart."". And his dead will end up hating me. So now Im sad because I dont want to have to keep hiding it completely from my mother, but I dont want her to talk to his parents about it either. I wish life were easier. But allswell, he's worth the frustration. My mother started crying. She's like, ""omg, you're actually wanting to have sex. you wouldnt even consider the thought of it with travis last year and you two were engaged. you must be head over heels for JESSE"". I was like ""well, duh! captain obvious. just because we're not engaged doesnt mean that I dont love him more than I loved travis. "" I had no fucking clue what I was doing or what I wanted last year when I was with him. And him in itself just didnt help. I wasnt meant to be with travis. obviously. and I never want to be. but i find it funny how i said yes to marrying him, and no to having sex with him like ever. Maybe JESSE just turns me on more or something lol. I dont know. All I know is I dont want my mom talking to his parents, but I also dont want to hide it any longer. My mom thinks that by at least ONE of his parents knowing it would make things easier, safer, and bring us all closer together as a family. God, shes acting like JESSE and I are planning on getting married, like its a forever thing for sure. No one knows how long this is going to last. I hope its forever, but who knows what might happen. I wish there were like a surefire way to make sure we'd be together forever and always but Im out of ideas lol. I know alot of girls are stupid and think that getting pregnant will make them theirs forever, but thats stupid and Im not crazy enough to do that. I dont want kids until Im like atleast mid 20's at the youngest lol. If that. There's gotta be a way. I just know it. Just like there has to be a way I can show him  JUSt how much I really do love him, but words cant even describe. SO what makes me think ""showing"" him will even come close to making him realize how much I love him. Its like,gr.... its killing me. I want to make him realize it but I cant. I thought that losing my virginity to him showed it but I dont think he gets it. I mean I know he knows I love him, he just doesnt know how much. And its killing me. 

yay! he called! sweet! *retarded happy dance* God I love him. 

yup, my mom still thinks Im a virgin, but knows that Im gonna lose it soon, lol...again. 

and apparently JESSE hasnt masterbated yet lol. *so proud of him*

I want a lollipop

Fight Clubs on, YAY!!!!!!!!! *BIG retarded happy dance*

....out of things to type....

g'night kids..

"event","I woke up with a knot in my stomache this morning. that always means its going to be a horrible day....I was right. 

At exactly 3:30 this afternoon my Aunt ELENORE was pronounced dead. She's been in the hospital for a few months now. We were going to leave the house around 4 to go visit her too. Odd how things happen like that. My dads cell phone started ringing while he was outside, I saw the number on the caller ID and noticed it was the hospital... I grabbed it and ran outside to give it to him, as soon as he answered, I saw the look on his face and just knew what had already happend. He's been crying for awhile now. I'm too pissed off to cry. I swear to God if one more person I love fucking dies I will kill myself. Im tired of crying..... 

I was watching The Crow earlier, which also made em cry. Always does. Theres so much meaning behind the movie itself. I love it. But there are two quotes in the movie that always catch my attention. I absolutley love them. The main one is ""It cant rain all the time."" I'm sure you guys can figure out the meaning behind that one. BUt then at the end of the movie, the little girl from the movie is speaking while they are doing an overlook of the city after all that has happend in the movie and she says this ... "" Sometimes the people you love get stolen away from you. BUt the best way to keep them around is to never stop loving them. Bridges burn, people die. But real love is forever."" And thats what I live by. I think that quote by itself explains more than enough questions in this whole entire world of ours. So in regards to my lost... I will never shed a tear, because Kevin and my Aunt Elenore will always be in my heart. And thats what matters. 

The only sad thing is that my fathers crying. He hasnt cried, or atleast I havent seen him cry since my brother Darryls funeral back when I was in 8th grade after he killed himself in our bathroom at my moms house. My phys. thinks that he might be the reason I am the way I am. Because I'm the one that found his bloody mess in the bathroom. .................... great, now I'm crying. This is depressing me. I'm going to bed until we have to leave for that fucking ""family dinner"" thing tonight. that ought to be interesting. 

and sorry if this is a majorly depressing entry guys.. but what can I say? actually no, Im not sorry. it wa syour choice to read this.

"event","I dont really have naything to say. Ive been kinda ify about alot of things lately. Today i smy dads 41st birthday and my brother Jasons 22nd birhday or whatever. theres so many birthdays in february and march, too many people were fucking at the same time... whores need to keep their legs closed. fish smells bad.

Im at my dads this weekend of course. I'll be at ym mothers for the following two weekends to be with JESSE the weekend before his birthday (march 21st)... he and I got inot a really bad fight lastnight. I didnt like it. it gave me thoughts of us breaking up and me wanting to take a break. I almost told him we should, but stopped short of breath before saying it because I realized thats a mistake, simply because I love him like theres no tomorrow or rainfall, and taking a break is just a sign of weakness because you are running away from the problems in your relationship with whomever it is you're having problems with. and I dont do that. if you love the person enough, you should be strong willed enough to stay on track in your relationship and fight it out and solve the problems calmly. although sometimes I do understand that they cant always be resolved calmly. sometimes screaming at eachother is the best way to let it out. so long as you are careful and dont fuck yourself over. like I usually do. hopefully I wont in this relationship, which is why Im hoping JESSE and I dont argue like that again. God I love him... *sigh* its sickening, really, it is. I feel powerless..

I miss Kevin... and my brother. I hate life.

Mankinds stupidity worries me. Especially when they are the docters prescribing my medications. And saying I need surgery. oh yea....

I have another meeting with my phys. on monday, I'll be gettig chekced out of school, yey! I wonder which paraent is going to bitch about taking me this time... DUN DUN DUN

and then there was jell-o ..... how exciting it was, all jiggly in its little bowl... and disgustingly filled with yuckiness and disturbing images that make you want to dip your family in hot boiling wax after hog tying them all together... dear lord, I do need help...lol

I love oyu buttercup! <3

"event","well this weekend was pretty good. the best part about my brthday was getting to spend it with JESSE. yey! I saw Scott at Disney Quest, unexpected.. that was nice. Havent seen him in a long while, I MISS YOU SCOTT! ..call me damnt! (407-497-6955 or 452-5910) even though you already know that. I miss PJ too, havent talked to him since a little while before my brithday. *sad face* 

well,yesterday I had school of  course, which sucked. I would have gone to church but JESSE got sent home from work because he was too sick to work. But instead of going home he came here because he's stubborn. He wasnt feeling up to church so his parents picked him up around 7:20-7:30'ish. And I didnt go to church because it just wouldnt feel the same without him and plus the whole day just wasnt a good one at that. So I stayed home and laid in bed. I cried a little, not sure why. Well actually I believe I do know why but eh... lets not get into that Im actually cheering up.

Today, being Tuesday, I shouldve gone to school but I didnt. I needed a day alone, all to myself. Which was nice. I slept for most of the day, called JESSE to see how he was feeling because he was home sick. And NO, he's not the reason I stayed home. I just needed to gather my thoughts and what not. They are still not completely gathered but I think I'm getting there. Few more days maybe. I'll be fine. I hope JESSE feels better soon though. Poor buttercup.

Saturday I went to the docters. They think I'm critically depressed. My doc said that she believes I had some kind of mental break down before over a major event in my life but I've completely blocked it out, thats why I dont remember what it is. She kept asking me if Ive ever been raped or abused and crap. I said no, I obviously didnt remember anyways so whats the point in asking right? well, they put me on a shit load of meds. yipee! more pills to pop. I hate meds. But this new stuff is supposed to really help with the whole depression thing and my moods of course.  She said that at first, for the first few weeks, maybe a month or so, I'll be kinda bi-polar and have alot of mood swings. So fair warning to you all. If I snap at you, please forgive me and just forget about it. Okay? She also said I have a cronic liver disease...more meds. It was caused by some sort of HP-V Virus. But the thing is, the virus can only be either sexually transmitted or come from the mother during birth. So yea, Im hoping its the mother thing becuase that would mean that she was right about something happening that I dont remember, or dont want to remember obviously. She asked me one last time if I have ever been beaten or raped, I replied with ""Define beaten."". That was the end of that appointment. I have to go back in a month. How exciting. The bad news is though, that I still have the virus somehow, and it can still be sexually transmitted, its extremely rare for the female to transmit it to a male but it could still happen. So I guess JESSE and I need to talk about that. They said the virus just mainly eats away at your liver, pankreas, and other such organs in that area. She was all like ""right now you have the liver of a 50 year old woman, you're only 17. so if you dont take the meds and get rid of the virus, theres a 80/20 chance you'll live to see your 18th birthday."" I was like, oh great. Nice way to start the day off. YOURE GONNA DIE! HAVE A NICE DAY!. the thing is though, that i hate meds, im against all the shit, and Im stubborn, so knowing me I wont take any of them and I'll die before Im frik'N 18 lol. I dont think I should be laughing but it sounds too depressing not to. Sorry guys. I really dont want to take the meds though. But its all gravy baby!

I love you buttercup! Twinkle Twinkle Baby! <3 SMILE!

"event","well, today is going to be long and boring. started out with me beating my little brother up over the head with the remote for jumping on my bed and waking me up this morning. exciting news there!

tomorrow is my birthday, hurray for getting older! such excitment. Im overjoyed, lemme tell ya. the only good thing about tomorrow is that I get to spend it with JESSE, as well as the other people. but who cares about that part. I see them all the time. just ebcause I see JESSE everyday doesnt mean it counts as us spending time together. 

sad news, I cant go to megacon today. *tear* . today just sucks. I have to go to the docters today aswell and get some tests done. they're experimenting on me... oh joyious is me. I get to sit in a chair for over an hour staring at a blank wall for some reason. not sure what that tests but whatever. needles, probing, the whole bit. lol. 

I mis JESSE, I hope he's feeling better. I told him to stay in bed today and get well for tomorrow but I doubt he's going to listen to me. He ussually never does. But I still love him so its all good.

I finally started posting things on my DA site. any DA's wanna check it out my usernames XautumnsXgloomX , go figure. I also started messing with myspace finally. Im so lazy. I can barely keep up with my lj. geez.

Im going car hunting later today. I decided I dont want daddy to pay for my car. which is also why Im now paying for my cell phone (which is working again), Im  soon to be paying for my own medication, not all of it because Im not rich, but most of it. And then I shall be buying my car and paying the insurance and such nonsense that involves my car. Aswell as any other bills that come along between now and whenever. All of that, and I still need a job, lol. Atleast I have use of the money in my account now. yay for that! no more of having daddy's name on everything. its all mine, and I earned every bit of it. simply because I saved every single paycheck from when I worked with my brother out in cocoa doing piercings. I pulled a smart one!

well, Im out of things to update you all on... life still sucks and I still hate people. nothings changed.. but things should..

I think JESSE and i fixed things lastnight. he told me he took some pills and that got me so worried I threw up and then went to bed eventually. not sure what time it was. but i think everythings fine now so yey!.

today is sunday... lazy day, boring. but im laying in bed with the love of my lfe so im happy. things are great when he's around. SMILE!

"event","well well well. I hate people! thats for sure. everyone is being such a monkeys asshole right now. I hate it. So I finally got the ticket from Erika for the military ball. that ought to be exciting! me..all dressed up? yea.... great. and, I'll actually have to stand for the pledge, otherwise I'll get jumped by a buncha patriotic people lol. but allswell. its just one night. I had to cancel going to my fathers house for that weekend so that I could be here for the ball. yay! that means I'll be in M.I. for two weekends in a row! yay! more time to spend with JESSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only thing is that I'll end up with ym father the weekend of my birthday.... so if anyone would like to celebrate it early, please join me in the celebration of saying ""yes! shaunna's finally 17!!! one more year of this hell hole!"" lol. I miss JESSE. He got checked out today at like 1:30 to go see his probation officer. I hope everything went alright... ::icky feeling in stomache:: and then he goes to court in the morning on valentines day. the worst day of my life and he ends up in court that day. go figure. should that be a bad sign or something? eh.. I have a pretty good feeling about this so I'm sure everything will be alright. So long as they dont send him away. But even if they do, I'll still be here waiting for him because Im a dedicated girlfriend who loves him just that much *teehee* so SMILE if you're reading this JESSE! I love you babe! anywho... Erika proposed to me today in history. and theres a rumor going around that Im pregnant with either erikas baby, or jesses lol. funny ha ha. Im a pregnant virgin who is apparently a whore as some people seem to think. how wonderful is that? geez.. I just love the way people think nowadays. lol. people make me laugh so fucking much.... *laughing away*...... *rolls on floor*.... fuck, I forgot to call Travis. damnt. I want some brownies. I made a thingy on www.myspace.com its interesting. no clue what the fuck Im doing on there but eh...what the hell right? lol its either under autumns_gloom or just shaunna. not sure. anywho... my doggy had her puppies yesterday . All seven of them. they are so adorable and tiny and like bleach white. they have little pink ears. they are so small they fit like two of them in the palm of my hand. it was gross watching them coem out though. eww... Im glad I wont have to see how gross its gonna be if I ever have kids. It was bad enough seeing my sister give birth, oh god was that gross. Ive decided I want kids, in like 10 years, but still. I want them lol. I want a little boy. Im not sure why I all of a sudden changed my mind about the whole kid thing but eh...whatever. I have a feeling it'll happen whether I want it to or not. Theres no way Im dying a virgin lol. Especially if JESSE and I stay together long enough, because wow, have you guys seen him? damn... sooo hot. yummy goodness. lol. gots to love'em. hehe well, I have to go check on the puppies and do some other stuff so yea.... valentines day is going to suck b/c of the court thing, Im gonna die of paranoia. I'll worry myself to death. lol, I have to get a dress for the ball this weekend so Erika and I are goign shopping sunday mornign until about 1 or so. and friday i'll see JESSE after he gets off work, then saturday I have a saturday school (again..I know), and after that ends at like 10 I'll coem home and see JESSE around like 10:30-11, then spend the day with him until he has to be home at 7 and I'll just go back to his house with him, YAY! I love his mother, shes so adorable. And he looks just like her, only not so feminine lol. plus, she doesnt hate me, I dont think. Unlike everyone elses mothers, just ebcause they see the eyebrow piercing and the dark hair, the makeup (sometiems) and the clothes, they automatically think ""omg, devil woman, stay away from my son"". Its sad really. ok now that Im done typing a buncha shit to update everyone, Im gonna go so, SMILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *kisses*"

"event","well... this weekend hsa been sucky so far. It will most likely end sucky. My father has officially disowned the rest of my older siblings. My brother James, because he moved out, my brother Jason because he just got put in prison (which really upsets me but I dont want to talk  about it too much), my sister Khrissy because shes doing photo shoots for Victoria Secrets so shes not daddys little girl anymore, and my other sister Noelle because she got an abortion (which was understandable by the way). So hes goen completely crazy. He took down all of their pictures and put them in a box in the attic. I cant spell.... I dont care about any of them except Jason. SO none of this really bothers me. It just means that I'm next on the list of children to disown in this family. Almost happend last year so Im kinda worried. He's already planning on me moving in with him after I graduate so that I can go to college out here. Yea,,,,,right. I mean, I cant live with my mom while in college because thats too far away from where I want to go. But I dont want to live with my fathe either although its closer and free of charge, but, no. Because he'll disown me when I leave for good. And plus, he'd spoil me rotten and I'd feel like a cheap whore who is daddys' little girl. Not going to happen. I'd rather be a bum on the street while in college than use his money. I hate using his money as it is now. but anywho... yea, Jillian got drunk lastnight and was throwing up this morning!!!!!!!! Im so proud of her! My little Jillian is growing up so fast. Even though she gave Danney my Atreyu poster (bastard), I still lovers her. But she better buy me a new one. So besides all that, I started talking with Lina again lastnight. That was pleasant. I miss her. I dont know why she thought I hated her. Silly girl, trix are for kids!Oh and another thing! My father just found out alstnight that my mothers been taking me to the gynocologist or however its spelt, for the past five years now. lol. he never knew. so yea, now he thinks Im not a virgin, and that JESSE and I are having sex. I'm telling ya, this whole sex issue just keeps popping up everywhere. Its kinda funny. So I am a whore until proven otherwise according to my father. Lovely family huh? yea, I know...  well, I should be coming back to merritt island in about 3-4 hours form now (yay, private celebration) I miss JESSE... its sad. Im like all eh when Im not with him. I hate it. I should really stop that. I should stop all of it, just stop caring and putting any effort into this whatsoever. And, I was right! He didnt update his journal sat. like he said he would! Go me! I knew he wouldnt. Bastard. He should listen to me more often. Allswell, I'll just delete his account and leave it alone. If he doesnt want a journal than whatever. His choice, his life. Im just going to start planning everything around my friends from now on, I havent actually hung out with any of them for awhile now that JESSE and I have been kinda getting to that so-called ""serious"" point in our ""so-called"" relationship. Im still fucking pissed off at david though. I cant believe hes fucking blowing off ALL of his friends for that fucking cunt ass 13 year old. She s gonna break up with him soon anyways. But noo...he doesnt listen me. Like everyone else. But thats ok. I'll still be here for him when he needs me. No matter how pissed off I might be. And I still dont understand why everyone is blaming ME and Justin for Matts new ""attitude"". He's acting different I will admit, but Justin and I have nothing to do with it. Matt didnt start smoking because of me, he started because of david and emily. I didnt even smoke then so you guys dont knw what the fuck you're talking about. I fucking hate all of this bullshit. None of the people in the ""group"" are even true friends to anyone anywyas. Im davids only true friend but he blew that off. Im matts, but he doesnt really care about anyone but himself when he gets all depressed. But Im still here for him. the rest of the people can go to hell. no need for names, you know who you are. and if you dont then you might want to think about it. the only people i dont hate at the moment are matt, david, jill, lina, scott, pj, robert, danney, nick, ty, and suzie. the rest of you can fucking go to hell! have a nice day! remember to SMILE!"

"event","yea..so. hmm... there's alot to update on but I'm not sure how to say it all exactly. Uh... alex (his name doesnt deserve to be capitalized) decied to start his whole evil weird thingy again. So now he's leaving messages on my phone saying that I'm a *deep breath* useless worthless piece-of-shit cunt ass whore who nobody cares about or loves and no one wants around because I'm ""heartless"". Yes. Me. Heartless. Funny huh? I'm like the sweetest person ever until you cross that line, which he DID cross. But yet he says ""what the fuck did I ever do to you?"". Yea, OKAY! Mmmm Buddy! Fucking cunt mother fucker. I hate him. Always have.,Always will. I thought that MAYBE just MAYBE he had changed over the past year but no. I was wrong. AGAIN! So thats it. Im over it. Im tired of his little twisted mind games. Its sick. He's sick. And he sucks dick. HA, it rhymes! *teehee*.... I miss JESSE (deserves very much so to be in all caps.) On Tuesday, the first of my favorite month, being February of course, lol. He told me those three ENORMOUS words that I was completely afraid of hearing. And I ALWAYS freak out and break up with the guy when I hear them but for once, I didn't. I guess that's a good sign eh? heh. I hope it is. The only thing that bothers me is that well... the whole ""sex"" thing kinda came up. And anyone who knows me knows I'm a virgin and knows how I feel about that whole thing so yea.... the fact that he's not a virgin and the number of girls he's slept with bothers me. Greatly. It's just... I don't want to lose it to him and then become like attached to him completely by it because ya know, you always remember your first, so I mean if we ever broke up I would be crushed. I'd like almost never get ovr him which is no good if we're not together lol. I mean I didn't even have sex with Travis and it took me until just now to get over him. And thats because eh was the first guy I ever ""did"" anything with, besides making out. SO yea.... It was hard to get over that. So I mean, just imagine me if I lost it to JESSE and then later on we broke up for some reason. There's no way I could get over it. I'd like, die. But you see.... if I don't lose it, EVER (lol) then I'll be able to get over anybody I want. The horrible thing is that, I want to lose it. And I want it to mean something, but I'm scared of the whole getting attached thign and then breaking up. And as much as JESSE says he doesn't care about the whole ""sex"" thing, I know he still wants it. I mean, he does have a penis, and he's not a virgin so, think about it. grr.... ::sigh:: I dont know what to do. Somebody please help me!!!????!!! Well, besides all that, I went to the dentist yesterday with my father and I should be getting braces on in a while, they just have to fix some teeth and shit. I have a feeling I won't get my braces on for a long ass time because my father likes to procrastinate (hope thats spelt right otherwise I feel dumb). I have an appointment for the whole liver thing with Dr.Weis on Tuesday next week. My mothers friend has to take me to that one though because both of my parents are lazy irresponsible fucks. But, I gotta love... my mom. Dad can go to hell. Well, actually they both can and most likely will but at least my mom DOES TRY. She does her best for being an alcoholic pothead. Which, I understand because I used to be so lol I cant really say anything. So anyways, I have an appointment with my ""crazy"" docter on the 17th. JESSEs lawyer is going to court for him on teh 7th, and he might have to go himself on the 14th. Valentines Day. I hate V-Day. Worst day ever. Always has been. Bad things alllwwwaayyss seem to happen. Last year was the first year I actually enjoyed it, and of course I was with Travis then so yea.. that explains it. I dont think JESSE celebrates V-Day, which sucks, so I'm guessing this year will suck just as much as the others always did. *sad face*... allswell. I swear, if anyone buys me anything (besides Jill b/c shes my Valentine) I'll kill them! But just remember everyone, its the day to show the people you LOVE and CARE ABOUT how much you love and care about them, so its not just a ""couples"" day, its for friends too. And family. ::sigh yet again:: I miss JESSE already, even though he just left my house before I started writing this lol. I cant help it. And I wish I didnt have to go to my dads anymore, I wish I could just go when I WANT to see him. Instead of being FORCED to go. That way I could see JESSE more. I'd love that. I also need a job. But then if and when I do get one I wont be able to go to my dads as much (yay! secret celebration) but I might also not get to see JESSE as much aswell. Which pisses me off. I hate this. Its so weird. Only being able to see Travis every other weekend once he moved never bothered me. So why does this? I think its because I let myself fall for JESSE. ::sigh:: thats alright though, he's worth the frustration and wanting. God I really do hope this last, like.. a REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY long time, like, not to freak anyone out or anything but I definetly dont think I'd even mind being highschool sweethearts. omfg! did I just say that? SEE! This is what happens when you let yourself fall for people and then fall in love with them. grr... now he'll probably read this and get all freaked out. He might not say hes freaked but he will be. I hope Im wrong about that. Better yet, I hope he doesnt read this lol. ever! I'd delete what I just typed up there so he cant read it but thats going against my whole thing for having this journal. I write what I think and feel, no matter what it is, no matter who might read it. This is me. SO DEAL WITH IT! Eventually someones bound to NOT freak out about the whole ""together forever"" thing or ""highschool sweeteharts"" as others put it sometimes. And the person who doesnt freak out will end up being my ""forever"" person. If and when they find me, or I find them. If we havent found eachother already. So yea... wow, anywho, look at the time!? !!!! I should uh.. go... so yea.... lat~

I <3 You All

So SMILE! (that means you JESSE)

And by the way, the little thing at the top that says what ""mood"" Im in, yea, its supposed to be SATURATION but it wouldnt let me add the ""n"" the end of it lol, fucking computers

"event","yup today definetly sucks... its Travis' 17th birthday. *tear* I don't know why this bothers me so much... my friend thinks its because this time last year on his birthdya was the first time he and I ever...like.... did, anything..... and alot of it. I want to call and say happy birthday but then again I dont. I kow he'd end up saying something, and it'll end with me crying for no reason. He always gets me so choked up over nothing, I hate it. And I hate the fact that today is that ""day"". I wish I could just like forget that anything ever happend and foget that he even exist but I cant.  Today just completely sucks. And I know Im gonna end up getting all bitchy and probably getting pissed off at someone for no reaosn JUST because of the whole thing about today. I have a feeling it'll be Jesse, lol. I'll probably snap at him for something and hang up on him or whatever... grr... I hate this. I hate it sooo much. And I miss Jesse. But even though Im going back to M.I. around 5 today I wont see him until school tomrrow, which sucks. So anyways, for anyone who reads this, if I get pissy wiht you today, I apologize in advance, just whatever you guys do, try to keep my mind off of things, so if I do hang up on anyone, just call back. Whatever you do, DO NOT leave me alone because I'll start thinking and thinking on days like today leads to trouble. Lots of it. ::sigh:: well.... Im about out of things to say. My phones working again so call if you need me.. <3"

before I leave you in the gutter.
that's where I found you dead. yeah.

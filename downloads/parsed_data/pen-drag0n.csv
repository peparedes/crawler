"event","MMos i play them i love them, while i am a bit burnt out from wow i still enjoy it and plan on playing the xpack when it comes out. i Picked up warhammer to me it has everything wow was missing when it comes to pvp and leveling in general there is no grind you get xp for regular mission running you get xp for doig PQ's (public Quests) and you get Xp for pvping, All made of win and if you dont like pvp you dont have to its easy to avoid like wow. But there is one other MMO i play that cant be put in the same zone as wow orwarhammer its EVE online.

Eve Online is a player-driven persistent-world MMO game set in a science fiction space setting. Players pilot customizable ships through a universe comprising over five thousand solar systems.Most solar systems are connected to one or more other solar systems by means of jump gates. The solar systems can contain several entities including but not limited to: moons, planets, stations, asteroid belts and complexes.

Players of Eve Online are able to participate in any number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, manufacturing, trade and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The range of activities available to the player is facilitated by a character advancement system based upon training skills in real time, even while not logged in to the game. You can even go so far as paying for the game with in game money. There is even a player run Government ""Council of Stellar Management""  who interacts with the devs and acts as a voice of what people want changed in game etc etc.

One thing that keeps eve on the top of the games list for me is there are always events going on every time you log in you see new news stories and you can track them down if you wish see them unfold or see whats left.  And every 6 months or so they bring out a new xpack free to players the latest is Quantum Rise and the last was Empyrean Age the following trailer is from Emp age ( all video is done in game btw)

<lj-embed id=""21""/>

I flew to the station in this report and there was ship debris and the station was half destroyed it was the coolest thing ever and now the next Xapc is coming out Quantum Rise

<lj-embed id=""22""/>

I am currently looking for this battleground, but WOW and WAR could learn a thing just from the way EVE keeps its community involved with the game and the real time events that  happen all over the universe.

and for the hell of it another trailer i found that really shows off EVE

"event","Today as i headed off to the training site i turn on the zune and low and behold it tells me a error has occurred and needs to erase my zune and reinstall software as i think to myself great too bad i am already on the road ass hat. I get home plug it into my comp and reformat it etc etc just to give me the same error again and again look like the hd got damaged, to top it off  a replacement HD plus repair cost is the same as a new player wtf is up with that. so im Sol on music in the jeep for a while. 

Todays drive home from the training site was just crazy what the hell is with the weather.  They sent us home early cause the wind was just insane dirt flying everywhere and had a couple small showers nothing spectacular, then on my way home right around the 15 and 210 it started pouring it would  lighten up and clear then start all over again. By the time i hit the 57 freeway it was hailing marble size hail stones and rain drops just as big then it turned back in to rain but the drops sizes the same. This continued all the way to the 605 interchange were about 1 mile before i got to the 605 it was snowing turned back into hail and was rain again by the time i was on the 605. Lighting thunder the whole works till about whitter and it was all sunny and warm it added about an hour to my drive but i enjoyed every minute of it."

"event","10 Ways to Please a Woman

1. Lick It as much as possible without expecting nothing in return.
2. Dont get caught! If you are gonna cheat have a plan. Or let her know so that she too can play.
3. Want and Give it no mater what time off the month it is.
4. Experiment. Use blindfolds, whips, toys, ect. Give and be willing to receive. 5. Talk dirty, say freaky things, but watch the B word too much of that can kill mood.
6. Give her sexy thoughts. Act as if she was a stranger you wanted to do and describe it.
7. Holidays, Birthdays, Anniversaries dont change. Remember them.
8. Massage the body and booty, take your time.
9. Let her hold the remote for more than one minute.
10. Have and keep a job, cook, clean, listen, take direction and she is always right. Learn it, Live it, Love it.

10 Ways to Please a Man

1. Shut up, no nagging, no questions and no looks. Just sit there.
2. Get him a drink. Liquor will help him put up with the woman that wont follow rule 1.
3. Leggo the remote. His show comes first.
4. Have dinner ready when he gets home.
5. Dont question just give it up.
6. If you want something ask for it. Men dont get hints, tell him the color, size, make and place where to buy it. Or, you buy it and then charge him.
7. Dont expect men to notice things. Point them out.
8. Dont ask him if you look fat in anything. Besides you dont want an honest answer, remember its not the clothes that make you look fat its the fat that makes you look fat.
9. Dont analyze him, men are what they are. Deal with it.
10. When in doubt, go naked."

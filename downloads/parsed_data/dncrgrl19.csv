my cell literally rang as soon as I read
the last word of this email!!!!!





















I am taking the bait -
what do I have to lose right?



























Hope it works!



























Supposedly The Phone Will Ring
Right After You Do This.



























Just read the little stories and
think of a wish as you scroll all
the way to the bottom. There is
a message there - then make your
wish.

I'm 13 years old, and I wished
that my dad would come home from
the army, because he'd been having
problems with his heart and right
leg. It was 2:53 p.m . When I made
my wish. At 3:07 p.m. (14 minutes
later), the doorbell rang, and
there my Dad was, luggage and all!!









I'm Katie and I'm 20 and I've been
having trouble in my job and on the
verge of quitting. I made a simple
wish that my boss would get a new
job. That was at 1:35 and at 2:55
there was an announcement that he
was promoted and was leaving for
another city. Believe me...this
really works!!!















My name is Ann and I am 45 years
of age. I had always been single
and had been hoping to get into a
nice, loving relationship for many
years. While kind of daydreaming
(and right after receiving this email)
I wished that a quality person would
finally come into my life. That was at
9:10 AM on a Tuesday. At 9:55 AM
a FedEx delivery man came into my
office.He was cute, polite and
could not stop smiling at me. He
started coming back almost everyday
(even without packages) and asked me
out a week later. We married 6
months later and now have been
happily married for 2 years.



What a great email it was!!



























Just scroll down to the end, but
while you do, think of a wish.
Make your wish when you have completed
scrolling. Whatever age you are, is the
number of minutes it will take for your
wish to come true. ex.you are 25 years
old, it will take 25 minutes for your wish
to come true).



























However, if you don't send this to
people in 5 minutes, you will have bad
luck for years!!



Go for it!!!















SCROLL DOWN!!!!

"event","Friday- went to school then to get gas and my hair cut, then to eddies to get him and alex to go to ambers dance competition in southfield. (ooo...and I made poms again lol :-D)

Saturday- woke up went to work came home and ate dinner then went over to walters for the night...that was fun then i got a call from him and i didn't even recognise his voice but i hung up on him. Then made walter call the number back to see if it was really him and they answered hello this is officer then sum name hahaha! ut ohh! It made me think a lot but i know i cant go back to that!

Sunday- woke up went to work then at 2:30 my boss said i could leave and come  back at 5 so i went home and took a nap and got paid. I got two calls from you today and i didn't answer even though maybe i should have but i think its better that i didnt!

Anyways this weekend was fun..but im unhappy about him. I guess i just need to have no contact what so ever w/ him because its just killing me and im trying to move on so hopefully i will keep being over you!

"event","So im really upset...so my mom found out about adam which most of you all know what im talking about! I would think that people wouldn't think about saying things in front of my mom but some people just don't know when to stop. So anyways my mom hasn't confronted me about it yet so i think i am going to talk to her tonite. I'm soo scared i just want things to go back to the way they were! I just want them to give him another chance.  He deserves it and no one could ever treat me as well as he does and they just dont' see that. Last night i watched the notebook for the first time and it made me so upset. Its exactly how me and him are. The girls parents don't like him and the guys parents like her and they get split apart for a while. I just wish we could end up like them and have my parents tell me its my choice and for me to do whats best for me...and not what my parents think is best for me! uhhh... i just hope things work out. well im done complaining...wish me luck w/ talking to them!!! I'm Out!

I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back



CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS


Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know its best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn



yea so it was a crazy weekend w/ recitals and hangin out w/ katlyn and stuff but it was a lotta fun...but im out bye xoxo!

i'll build your dreams with these two hands
we'll hang some memories on the wall
and when (and when) just the two of us are there
you won't have to ask if i still care
'cause as the time changes the page
my love won't ever age at all

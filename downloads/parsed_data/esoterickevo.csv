"event","I had this dream that i had dug up a frozen yeti sort of like incenio man with pauly shore. after i dug him up he started yelling at me in english about ""what if ____ happened since i have been frozen!!!?"" 
so i built a machine that would show you these hypotheticals. i realized after i woke up that this is stolen right from futurama. also the yeti talked like Morbo, the alien newscaster. 

So i plugged him into the machine and he yelled at it ""show me what would happen if i were a giant and was sent to destroy george bush!!!"" so the machine does that and shows him like 30 feet tall parachuting into a military base and just starts beating ass on these soldiers assigned to protect the presidential bunker. he's flicking them out of the way with his big harry fingers and then he goes ""how would you like a little King Haidron's hot sauce left overs?!"" and he shits in his hand and throws it like a grenade by a bunch of soldiers and it blows up in a big stinking cloud and all the soldiers start throwing up. the yeti starts trumping into the bunker laughing his ass off. 

then the yeti back in real life goes ""AWESOME!!!! now show me what would happen if i ate a sandwich with too much dijon mustard on it!!!"" (as if that's really what a yeti would b curious about after being frozen for ages) and the machine whirls up and the dreams cuts to him sitting on a bench in a park during the spring and it's really hot for him because ya know, he's a yeti built for the arctic and all. then he takes a big bite out of this sandwich and all this dijon mustard comes spilling out of his mouth and is left on his chest and he has this mustard up around his lips and he's just chewing away. but a close up of a yeti's lips covered in excess mustard was way more gross than i thought it would be. he just says ""that's a well made sammich..."" 

at this point i woke up laughing my ass off. i was laughing so hard i woke up my girlfriend and she was all pissed off because i couldnt explain what i was laughing about."

"event","the onion had this stock report for ""that's what she said inc."" saying something about how the employees were all odly excited when they heard the news that their stock went down quickly.

today this girl came in to rent a camera and she got a super8 camera after having just been in the 16mm class. anyways i handed her the film and she held it and kind of limp wristedly shook it around in her hand and said ""awww, it's all small again""... and the combination of her hand motion and the fact that we had just talked about that onion thing just before she walked in resulted in everyone there cracking up laughing for like 3 straight minutes.

"event","I've been sick now for three weeks. Pretty typical of me around this time of year. Which means that I have barely been able to keep up on school work and my social life has gone straight to crap. I've been frantically working on my final film lately trying to get it salvaged from the disaster it was turning into. So far I've made one of the most depressing things ever. I set out to make something heavy but with a sense of understanding for how things are- kind of like how Ozu always did that mono-no-aware thing. It's kind of hard to explain, I'm sure wikipedia has some junk on it though if you really care to look it up. Anyways, I've made something that I find really depressing, so maybe that's really just how things are. I dont know. I'm going to try and add some star wipes and some boingy spring sounds and shit like that to see if it will lighten up the mood a bit.

In another depressing note- I was thinking the other day about how much I hate the idea of walking in on a dead body. Every time I go into the dark room to develop film I think about that. I get into the room through the light tight tube door and then i fumble around looking for the light switch and every time, right before i flip on the lights, I hesitate thinking about how freaked out I would be if the lights revealed a body hanging by a rope from the pipes along the ceiling. I think that what bothers me most is that the idea of seeing some one in the act of dying is less troubling to me than seeing the end result when I wasnt expecting it. I'm ok with the idea of morgues and all that, dead bodies are expected there. But they certainly are not expected in the darkroom or in a basement or anything like that. I am weird.

and just so you dont think I'm a total freak, here's some youtube shit:

this is a music video from a band called We Are Wolves. they are three hilarious and very nice guys from french canadia land. they have a pretty good sense of humor about themselves and the hipster scene and their music and all that which I think is nicely reflected in this video

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mH2ZIlTRsQ&rel=1]

and also, defgrip has the new shook trailer up:

http://blog.defgrip.net/archives/1869#more-1869

pretty sweet blocky font... i wonder who had that for their cover art first? maybe a shitty little bike video called polyester fashion. and also, in a grand coincidence that wraps up today's post so neatly is that for my next (ex-next) video Hometown Heroes, i was going to have the intro sequence be a motion graphics montage of video game looking stuff for the titles and it was going to be cut to a we are wolves song which fit it perfectly. but now i guess i cant do that or people will just say i'm biting shook's stuff. whatever. at least i know my ideas are cool."

i'm not sure why i suddenly thought of this today but for whatever reason, i did and laughed about it to myself in class. then i remembered this kid from elementary school named tom dewey. im pretty sure he was like the great nephew or something like that to the Dewey of decimal invention fame. anyways, i thought about this kid and how weird he was. he was totally into the civil war... like had all the ken burns stuff on 12 volume vhs and had replica uniforms from both sides and all kinds of stuff. he was waaaay into it. and i remember thinking that was weird- for a 4th grader. but maybe im weird for thinking that was weird AS a 4th grader. 

and then class was over and i packed up my shit and got on with life.

thank all the gods ever for azure ray right now calming me down with their sweet words and sounds.

and here's some photos of kailee i just finished working on:

"event","Take your X-TREME marketing and shove it.


I was in a gas station the other day doing my part to fight terrorism by filling my sedan with regular unleaded, when I decided to go inside and get a snack . When I walked down the aisle I noticed that the snack I usually get, Corn Nuts, was missing, and in its place were CORN NUTS: CORN GONE WRONG. 


 
Corn gone wrong is also known as rotten. 
I was confused. It looked like my regular Corn Nuts, but the packaging had X-TREME attitude, it was more OUTRAGEOUS and/or TOTALLY AWESOME. There was even a new mascot: a corn on the cob with a fist clenched in defiance, which I can relate to because I too am rebellious and angst-filled. Marketing this powerful grabs me by the dick and forces me to buy this product. On the back of the package you might expect to find a product description, but no. You get more BAD ATTITUDE: 


 
The packaging asks a simple rhetorical question: ""THINK THIS IS JUST SOME ORDINARY CORN SNACK?"" Before you can even say ""yes"" to yourself, you get slammed with: ""WRONG!"" In your face! Corn Nuts marketing: 1, your judgement: 0. I can't argue with the packaging, Corn Nuts are indeed hardcore--as hardcore as fried vegetables can be. This package was so inspiring that I decided to create my own packaging for a fictitious brand of banana chips using the same formula: 



Little by little, advertisers are moving towards the ""X-TREME"" marketing school of thought (or lack of thought, as the case may be). Everything from Jello to health bars are being plastered with the ""X-TREME"" eye sore: 





I bought the X-TREME Soynut bar and took it home to try it out, because I bet people who snowboard and bungee jump live off of X-TREME Soynut bars and Mountain Dew (Mountain Dew is by far the most X-TREME brand of sugar water). When I got home, I anxiously opened the package, stepped back a few feet, and waited for the bar to back flip off of the table and jump into my mouth. The bar just sat there. I couldn't understand: the packaging said ""X-TREME"" but the Soynut bar seemed incapable of mountain biking. Thinking that I got a defective bar, I moved onto the Jello. I opened the package and waited for the jello to kick me in the face and force its way down my throat. Alas, nothing. It just sat there, almost as if I bought a non-X-TREME brand of product: the plain old nerdy kind of food that you can eat without cruising on a skateboard. Damndest thing, because the package clearly indicates a significant amount of TOTALLY AWESOME attitude. 

I felt ripped off, so in an effort to salvage the money I wasted on this bullshit, I ate six cups of jello, one bag of corn nuts, a Soynut bar, and a bag of jelly beans for dinner. The only thing X-TREME about this experience was the X-TREME dump I took later that night: 



I finally realized that the real spirit of X-TREME sports lies not in the food you eat, but in the shit you take afterwards. I learned a valuable lesson: X-TREME marketing isn't just a ploy to get gullible teens to waste their money on crappy products, but it's a way of life that rewards patient and faithful consumers with diarrhea that contains magical X-TREME Sports fairies who can grant you wishes. Either that, or stomach cancer and high blood pressure. 



Wake up you lardasses."

"event","Jackass: Finally a show named after
its target audience. 

MTV sucks. The other day one of my friends (who is no longer my friend because I upper-cut his head off--Mortal Kombat style) came up to me and said ""Hey, have you seen Jackass?"" Yeah, I've seen jackass. What the hell is wrong with people? 
MTV is making millions of dollars for what? For having some guy marinate himself in pig shit and running around harassing people? Turn it off. Who the hell cares, really? What people don't realize is that they're not watching jackass; they are the jackass. 

MTV is not funny. It's not cutting-edge, original or interesting. It's not rebellious or anti-censorship. What it is: shit. Plain and simple. They might as well have some guy taking a dump on TV for 24 hours a day. Hell, I'd watch that. At least then I'm not being fooled into thinking I'm watching anything more. 

I have a great idea for a new MTV show. It's called ""Dumbass."" The premise is simple. I'd go door-to-door where people are watching MTV and I'd just sit there and record the glazed-over expressions on their faces. Then I'd market it to all you dumbass ""EXTREME SPORTS"" idiots and make millions. Man, I hate people"

"event","Here's a thought:
TURN OFF YOUR DAMN CELL PHONE. 



I was at a theater the other day when suddenly some asshole's cell phone went off right in the middle of the movie! AAAAGGGHHH. Since when did everyone in the universe need to be contacted at any given moment and anywhere in the world?! You'd think that turning a cellular phone off during a movie would be standard procedure out of courtesy and consideration of others, but apparently four people thought otherwise. 

The first three interruptions weren't that bad, as they quickly turned off their phones (after fumbling for 5 minutes, looking for the damn thing). The last one, however, was a complete DIPSHIT. This chick gets a phone call in the middle of a movie.. so what does she do? She takes the call of course. Not only that, but she sits there and talks to the caller!! Right in the middle of the movie, this jackass is exchanging phone numbers, addresses, greetings.. hell, they probably even had high school flash backs. AAGGHHH. 

You know.. it's bad enough that these dipshits are stupid enough to bring a cell phone to a movie, but then to top it off, they have a musical ringer! Nothing says ""I'm an asshole"" like your cell phone going off to ""Phantom of the Opera"" in a theater. Man, I hate people. 

It's not like going to the theater isn't bad enough to begin with; having to watch some jackass try to impress his date in front of you is enough to make me PUKE. Now give that jackass a cellular phone, and presto. Instant asshole. Damn. At least if you're going to bring a phone to a theater, have the decency to put it on silent mode. Anyone with me on this?"

"event","Reasons to Cry During Titanic:


1. You just realized that you wasted $6.50 to piss away three hours of your life to watch a movie that you knew the outcome of. ""Hmm.. a movie about the Titanic. I wonder how it's going to end."" 

2. You realize five minutes into the movie that James Cameron raped you and all the other suckers in the theater out of $6.50, and that he's laughing his ass off at you for being such a susceptable dumbass. 

3. After the movie is over, you notice all the other wimps in the theater that cried during the movie, and you realize that we have a long way to go as a society. 

4. You used too much paint thinner on your eyes when you were trying to cleanse them of the bullshit they just saw. 

5. You remember that you pissed away three hours of your life. 

6. You realize that if 10 million people saw the movie once, each wasting 3 hours of their lives, that 30 million hours have been wasted, and that if each person lived an average of 70 years, 3,424 years, or 49 lives will have been wasted watching the Titanic. James Cameron has effectively murdered 49 people. (Not necessarily a reason to cry, but it is to a sap that saw Titanic in the first place). 

7. You realize that you don't give a rat's ass about the Titanic and all the people who died on it, and that you can't get a refund for your ticket. 

8. You realize that the movie made enough money to actually raise the Titanic, and that you would have rather spent your money to see the real thing. 

9. You know that everyone in the theater will die someday, and seeing a bunch of losers get sunk on a ship puts your own impending doom into perspective. 

10. You're a dumbass for seeing Titanic, and you know it."

"event","I rule.
You know, I've been thinking recently about how much I rule. I'm really a great guy. If I weren't me, I'd wish I was. Why am I so great? I ask myself that question sometimes: 


1. First of all, I'm a pirate. That alone makes me rule over everyone. Pirates by definition rule because they're so mean.


2. Next, I'm a robot. 





3. I'm too tired to be up working on my web page.


4. I should be writing my research paper for history.


5. History sucks.


6. Who cares about the ""inherent conflict between freedom and equality"" anyway? What a stupid topic to write a paper about. Writing blows.


7. 


8. HEY. this web page sucks.


9. 


10. I wonder if I ate some green jello right now, and I barfed, if my barf would be green. Mmm.. green. Green is my favorite flavor.


11. Everything green tastes good, I decided. (don't ask me about green boogers, and other such nonsense, because I'd only eat green things that were reasonably edible).


12. Why don't people just leave me alone?


13. go away.


14. I wish I had some more money.. I'd buy a llama or something.


15. What kind of name is llama anyway? Who thought of that one? What a stupid name.


16. I kind of like it.


17. 


18. I wish I were an ASTROnaut. Instead, I'm a crummy pilgrim with a giant cyst on my face. no-wait. that's my nose. hHAHAH

<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Friday</FONT></STRONG>-stared after with audro til the games and before them we walked with monica to mcdonalds. it was cute reminscing about last year's crew season haha good times. good times.&nbsp; then i sat with a bunch of people during the jv boys game and then with martha, mer, brehm, max, alyssa and other people during the varsity. it was sweet although my ass started to hurt major.&nbsp; after it audo, max and me went to &nbsp;the mall for like an hour and saw some kids. audos mom picked us up and dropped me and max off at her house. then max's mom drove us to larristers and naters to chill..we watched that stupid ""cinderella story"" movie which everyone adores..but i dont see anything really good about it. i think its terribly dumb. max and larrister fell asleep while me and nater watched it and realized how dumb it was. then larrister drove us home around 130ish..</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#66ff99 size=4>Saturday</FONT></STRONG>-went home from max's and slept. then hadda clean the house b/c people were coming over before <FONT color=#ff99ff>semi</FONT>. audo and i got ready here then me,audo, and gret went to max's for pix. her mom dropped us off here and tami, dayve, mark, tini, adam and dan came here for pix. we left for semi and i danced the night away! i looked madd cool in the shades and hat and dancing around with my buds! hahah i must say that probably was the best dance i've been to. i had a pretty damn good time. after it all of us with maxine and larrister went to max's to chill. audo fell asleep b/c she wasnt feeling well and we watched some&nbsp;beat movie that some dorkwad made us watch and then we chilled. everyone left basically by 3 and gret fell asleep..except for larry who we drove home around 4 o clock int he morning lol. </P>

"event","<P>okay.. i really don't feel like writing about my weekend..i mean it was awesome i'm just really not in the mood. i'm so friggin drained. i hate it. i mean if you really care that much which i know you don't..just go to greta's lj. i mean we hung out so basically hers would be sorta like mine except for my whole blabbering entry the whole time and hers is sweet and simple.</P>
<P>yea so i was sick yesterday and on tuesday i didn't feel so well either.&nbsp;teetee said for the past 3 days i've been looking flushed..i thought i was too. i haven't been in the greatest of moods..i've been terribly out of it and now i'm mentally, physically and emotionally drained. i have major headaches/migraines, stomache hurts like no other, and i feel like im gonna puke all the time. (gross i know but o well). i feel terribly flushed and i'm pale&nbsp;(well duh already) but&nbsp;like&nbsp;im terribly red in the cheeks. i feel terrible and just like crap.&nbsp;i&nbsp;did sleep for 16 hours from tuesday-wednesday (1130-330) or however many hours that is..but i'd think i'd feel refreshed wouldnt you? wrong! i feel like shit!&nbsp;i mean i sorta have a lotta stress and shit going on i guess but i mean its not so terrible i mean i could usually deal with this shit.</P>
<P>today i was just in a bleh mood. i tried to appear happy b/c i hate when people ask me whats wrong. i feel like i shouldn't make them deal with what i have to or bring them into it. because i feel bad that they hafta listen to me complain sometimes. they shouldn't have to listen to me complain and whine when they have their own life to worry about. but tonight i just like i dunno.</P>
<P>anyway..i guess im sorta stressed because of my grampop. i mean as some of you know he got in a motorcycle accident on friday night. some dickhead piece of shit ran into him//ran him over and speed away. what a fucking asshole how the hell could you do that to someone? ughh! that pisses me off so much. that shows how screwed up this hellhole world is..well at least some parts of it. so yea thank god there was an off duty cop near by that saw it happened and the car. but yea my grampop didn't have a helmet or leather or w/e on because he was only taking a quick little stroll around town. as some of you know or don't most of my dad's side of the family lives in philly/roxborough and some he was on hm..ridge &amp; umbria sorta i guess. but yea so the asshole drove away and my grampop was on a ventilator, with tubes, his arms with the first layer of the epidermis torn off, 3 broken ribs, and a punctured lung. he went to temple which is odd b/c his hospital is roxborough but they dont have an emergency unit there anymore or he would go to hahnemahn in center city because he went there for his pneumonia, and past surgeries and all. but he went to temple hospital in north philly (where my mom works) b/c i guess that's the only one with open area. yea but i found this out on my way home on crew practice b/c it happened at like 530 and we got out around then. my mom dropped me off at the house and met my dad, and my sister drove home from work although she was onlyt here for liek&nbsp;5 minutes. but yea i basically broke down when i got home and my brother hugged me and started crying to..it felt like a kodak moment sorta..except for we both felt like shti and were crying and well yea.. that night i went out feeling like shit b/c if i stayed home i probably woulda done stupid shit or just been in the worse of moods.</P>
<P>i mean i guess he's okay now hes off the ventilator and all but he still has chest tubes, and he needs therapy. ..i guess going to church every sunday and praying does pay off...i mean wat are the odds of getting a hit and run with no helmet or leather&nbsp;and having absolutely nothing wrong with your brain or him not dying. i swear..my aunt debbie musta been watching over him. with his upper layer of epidermis torn off his arms, a punctured lung, and 3 broken rebs and chest problems i must say hes pretty damn lucky. and the funny thing is my pop pop says "" i don't think my bikes so bad...i'll be riding that thing again soon! don't you worry!"" i love him.</P>
<P>there's one thing i just don't understand. how can the world have so much assholes in it to fucking hit a 70 year old dude and drive away. its not like you can't notice hitting a fucking dude on a motorcycle. i hope they find the bastard and sew his ass (what im pissed and sad not a good mixed) because it could be considered attempted murder with all the other shit of hit and runs, speeding, etc.&nbsp; but yea i basically useda live at my grams for 10 years when i lived in roxborough b/c i went there everyday after school and sat and watched tv with my pop pop. hah he always made me watch jaws, and his stupid fishing and hunting shows. but i loved every moment. he always had in stash swedish fish and gold fish for us. and we just sat together. i miss it.</P>
<P>well i mean i guess i should stop talking because he's alive and everything's gonna be okay they say but i mean ive been so drained, sick, tired, and just disgusted. i've been in the worst moods and today has just been horrible i guess. okay you really shouldn't have read my dull stupid time b/c there's about 100,000 people that died in the tsunami and they have families but no homes anymore. well i just felt like i could complain to my journal and know that i am don't have the worst off which i already know. i'm gonna stop complaining and go watch the news and think of how to change this screwed up world although nothing can change it. i can't imagine what those people who were affected by this calamity (nice vocab) felt...= /</P>
<P>sorry bout the long entry..i felt like complaining and writing although i shouldn't have</P>
<P>_*jen</P>
<P>ps. you don't have to comment or sympathize. just think of all those people who lost lives and others and homes... and do something about it..or try&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i know i'm gonna think of something somehow</P>"

"event","<P>Hey dudes! Okay so nothing's really happen i guess important lately but today was a good day man lol. Today we had a 1/2 day b/c of Thanksgiving tomorrow. I'm going to my aunt's house with the whole kerp family lol. hopefully it'll be good and I'll probably just end up playing with my little 4 yr old cousin Dan and my 1 yr old cousin Taylor and my sister and Heather (16). Today I had school and well it was just shortened periods in which we did absolutely nothing. haha although it was pretty fun. One thing I must comment on: We watched some random ass movie in Science Fiction about how a meteor striked earth and these two people became magnetic.. I was like WTF mate?! and then in spanish we watched part of a spanish music video. hah Bourbon (katie) was gettin excited b/c she thought Mr. Watt was gettin happy and she's like ""jen keep dancing!!!!!"" haha. So after school, Audo, Max, Emma, and me drove to Angelo's and ate there. At 130 we drove over to CADCOM in Norristown b/c we were supposed to serve in a soup kitchen but it just all screwed up and we only stayed for like an hour and half and then Varga drove us back to Audos and we met Brehm's car there. hah It was funny reminiscing our NJSP weeks. hah And we had like six people on Audrey's one chair squished on it: me, Brehm, Max, Mer, Mart Mart, and Alyssa hah but we were still comfortable. Then after the meeting larry and nate picked me and Max up and we drove Emma home. We ended up staying at Emma's til like ehh 930ish i guess or 10. I don't really remember but we ordered food, sat around, and just talked and messed around. It was really interesting and fun. Oh yea then Dreweroo came at like 7 I think or something. Drew drove us back to Max's and sat on her new couch in her redone room. It's very lovely. We were just being stupid, and it was full of tickles, stupidity, crossdressing, barbie girl, techno music, dancing, and well stupidity and funniness. I must admit although it was an extremely odd day it was way interesting and fun if you think back on it!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Since tomorrow's Thanksgiving I'd figured I'd do that Fourteen Friends crap to say I'm thankful for them I guess &lt;3""> </P>
<P>I know I'm a little late but I'm doing that Fourteen Friends crap...yea i join trends/fads late.. what now bitches.</P>
<P>one]-Oh goodness. We've been together since well we were <STRONG>born</STRONG> ((that obviously gives it away but oh well)). Through skinned knees, being teased, friends problems, boy problems, and every other fault and problems <EM>kids</EM> and <EM>teenagers</EM> have, you've been there.&nbsp; We pretended we were the spice girls, had fashion shows, played on my swingset, played at the corner church and just had so many childhood memories together. I really would not be anything of what I am today without you. So many memories in which we continue to live on and sleepovers. You're always there for me and though I moved away from you in <U>Roxborough</U> I know you're just a phone call away and you still visit me all the time. I love you to death and would do absolutely anything for you.&nbsp; Although you anger me sometimes because of the decisions you make, we always get through things together.&nbsp; You probably won't read this b/c you don't really have online or w/e but you'll see it some day and you know I love you.<BR><BR>[two] - Oh goodness. So ever since I moved in <STRONG>5th grade</STRONG> we've been best friends. About 6 years later, we've had our stupid little fights for like a day but gave up because we love hanging out with each other and being with each other.&nbsp;<STRONG><U> Florida,</U></STRONG> <EM>sleepovers every weekend basically</EM>, birthdays, football games, mall, movies, and just all the memories we've had..well yea I would never replace them for anything in the world. You're always there for me when I'm in a bad mood and you always&nbsp; give me aplace to stay when i need it. No matter what we have fun with each other and I can trust you with all my heart. I love you and we've been through a lot with each other and I'm glad we have been together because I wouldn't be able to do it without you. Omg wait!! Look a dear! ::kisses:: hah<BR><BR>[three] - Oh my. Well where should i start? Although I didn't like you when I first met you, we soon became best friends.&nbsp; Ever since <STRONG>8th grade,</STRONG> you've been there for me nonstop and help me through everything. Although we get in petty fights over things like whether a <EM>teacher is hot or not</EM> ((and no he doesn't look like him)) and how you can predict who I think is hott ((Which I must admit you're very good at)), we always kid around ((as shown lol)) and have fun.&nbsp; This summer we spent every weekend and every other day together.&nbsp; The shore, camping, birthdays&nbsp;and Knoebel's ((im giving this way away but just not saying their name)) were amazing and man, I miss those places!&nbsp; No matter what I'll always be there for you and I'll be there to lie to your sister so she can think I'm lindsey lohan, the chick from play, and a model. haha. You always give me great advice and help me out.. and I seriously do appreciate and love you! </P>
<P><BR>[four] - Okay although she's not gonna read this b/c<EM> she's never on when I'm on,</EM> I'd still like to say her b/c obviously I love her with all my heart. From the <STRONG>first day I was born</STRONG> you were always there for me.&nbsp; We always useda fight about stupid things and now we just fight about s<U>tealing each others clothes</U>, cleaning, etc.&nbsp; You are always there for me to talk to and help me out with advice.&nbsp; I think you're <STRONG><U>one of the best ones</U></STRONG> out there and I love you. You take me to concerts, out to eat, places you go, to Roxborough, and do so much for me.&nbsp; I know this is really corny and all since well yea, but you are one of my best friends. There's not memories to name b/c the only memory I can think of is my whole life. Every day you either call me or are here.&nbsp; I love you and always will be here for&nbsp;you. ((if anyone knows who this is, you can just say it when you comment lol..its not hard at all))</P>

"event","Man..last night was one of the best nights I've had in a while! No drama, no confusion no nothing but fun! Lemme tell you.
But yea CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UPPER MERION VIKINGS FOR WINNING DISTRICT CHAMPIONSHIPS! WOOHOO! YOU GUYS ROCKED!

So yea it started off with me picking up Audo and Dan S called asked if he could have a ride. So I gave him one although we almost missed the bus and I almost killed him =D. On the way there, me and Audo were just discussing our lives and talking about stupid crap and being our stupid selves. Me and Audro find seats when we got there, got food and just chilled. I sat with different people throughout it and talked to different people and just messed around. hah Audie made me fall b/c we were jumping around on the stands and she pushed me and fell and then she grabbed me and I fell on top of her. we were layin there laughin so hard for like 10 minutes while people just stared at us. hah At the end of the game, Me and Kotie were like holdin each others hands at the top of hte stands while everyone was at the bottom but we had a better view! muaha! But yea me and Kotie were sooooo nervous and holding each other! and we won and were like OMG OMG OMG! WHAT NOW BITCHES! WHAT NOW! and we hugged each other. Then, everyone jumped the fence and me, Gret and Kotie did and we ran out ont he field. Me and Audie jumped on top of each other and I ran around with Kotie on my back screaming! I ran up to all different people screaming and jumping on top of them because it was UM's first time winning District Championships. 
Then, we left and I was being a total jackass with people and me and Gret with a group of people were searching for the buses. and some cheerleader from GV was like ""You guys better be quiet b/c some GV kids might like jump you."" and I'm like ""Bitch please yea right they'll kick our ass! You're just bitter honey!""
So then me and Audo find each other and our bus. We got on the bus and had a fun ride home. Dee and Abe were rappin and me and Audie were back ups. The whole ride home our bus was so loud and we had like no one on it. Then i sang the ""wheels on the bus"" and got everyone into it. There was not one silent moment on our bus man! We hung out the windows, banging, screaming and yea it was fun! Woohoo! 
When we got back escorted by firetrucks and all I just danced around with Gret, Audie, Kotie, Maria, and Krista and a bunch of others. It was so fun I was crackin up man. 
So finally we left and me, Elyse, Ali, and Audo went to Audro's and hung out there piggin out. Elyse and I started dressing up in these costumes and then Audrey joined us! haha Me and Elyse walked out when Mark and Troy got there. And they were like ""holy shit..wtf!?"" hah We looked like such jackasses they thought we were drunk. Then I made up some dance thinga nd me and Elyse started doing it. so then, Audie, elyse and me just kept dressing up and like none of the outfits fit us. Ridgeway came while we were being stupid too. Then, me, ali, elyse, and audrey played Mall Madness Baby! Audrey gave up. And I was so lost because they kept having sales at different stores. so then I flicked ali's and elyse's pieces everywhere and im like ""Warning Warning! A Hurricane and Tornado is heading straight for the mall!"" And then i just flicked and through the game everywhere. hahahahaha and Elyse and Ali were cracking up while Ali kept saying ""JEN YOU'RE SUCH AN ASSHOLE!"" hahah so then I kept making fun of Ali. 
We put on the Spice Girls Movie and I never realized how such of a no plot it had and point. Oh well I still loved it! and all of us girls were singing it while troy, mark and ridgeway were just staring at the girls. twas very funny i must admit. We basically just sat around doing nothing and relaxing and being crazy at the same time b/c we just..well were i guess. ali and elyse left and then ridgeway and mark. me and audro talked to troy before his dad came. then me and audro headed for a lovely walk at 2 in the morning for a lovely 30 minute walk to my house. hah it was an interesting time talking, telling stories, huddling b/c we were freezing sorta and it was raining. walking through the woods we screamed the spice girls to not be scared and then we saw like 40 yr olds making out at 200 in the morning! WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT?!?! So Audie pointed the umbrella at them and we tried to be so quiet so they couldnt see us although i was gonna gag. I know its weird but yea it seems so like wrong for 40 yr olds//older people to do it. blehh! We got to my house, ate food like usual and just chilled and went to sleep around 330ish.

So yea Audrey left at like 1 and I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT I'M DOING FOR MY CHEMISTRY PROJECT. I was sooo stressed and all and now I'm just like relaxed a bit since I know what I'm doing.
Although I'm still sick and i have no voice b/c i screamed so much last night, I have work tonight 5-10. PPLLLEEEAAAAASSSSEEE VISIT ME BECAUSE I'M GONNA FEEL TERRIBLE, BORED AND JUST BLEH! you'll make my day =D. Call my cell if you wanna hang out after work or go to the movies or something!

Later

"event","Hi. So as always I update like once a week and sometimes skip a few. but hey I'm still updating. I hate updating school days because I never remember what happens so as always I'll just do the weekends.

so um..last weekend o god man i can't think back that far. gosh why do i have such a terrible memory! o wait okay i think i remember!!! 
Friday-went to larrister/nater's house with max and chilled there. justin m came over and we just played cards. me and max won but jutt wouldn't play by the right rules..sheesh. we left around um.. 1ish im guessing.
Saturday-i had work and i totally forget who i worked with. i think it was like me, jaz, um..gret maybe i totally forget but it's all good. that night me and max basically went to the movies but ended up not staying. then kenny came and we just walked around kop and looked at the pathetically t-ped bushes that weren't even t-ped it was like basically a napkin on top of a bush or like one piece thrown over a tree. what is that nonsense! then we met up with kevin, bill and brian. we all walked to wendys and me and max went through the drive thru in our invisible car. we got food but it looked like we were dealing drugs b/c the lady didn't want her manager to see. we sat at blockbuster and just messed around and went home around um..im guessing 1ish? then i slept over max's.

!!!Halloween!!!-okay i love halloween. i swear man i don't wanna grow up b/c halloween is the shit! anyway so i went to ctina divas and met elyse there we all got ready and then maxine came over. me and ctina were kitty cats ((ow ow)) and elyse and max were bunnies ((sluts..ugh kidding lol)). so then kyle z called and asked if we wanted to hang out so we met kyle, eric k, jonny l, and jutt m around 7 at 6-11.  We walked to sweetbriar and just chilled there for like ehh about a half an hour and then we walked around kop for like 2 hours or so. we visited emily, tini and i saw chris tini!! ahha the man of my dreams. haha man that kid thinks i'm in love with him. i mean..i am of course. anyway so we went back to tees and just chilled for a while. the guys left and me and max left around i think it was like 1030 maybe.

so yea that was last weekend. this weekend pretty much sucked although it did have its fun moments.
friday-went to the game and was freezing. me, ctina diva, and max walked to elyses and we stole her handwarmers..okay so she gave them to us but still. we walked back and chilled there for a while until it was over in which um kicked methacton's ass! what now lupinacci!?! lol. later we went to tees and pigged out and took pictures and i drew on tees face with cheese whiz haha.
saturday-i woke up at 5 ((yea i know doesnt that suck)) and i went to new york city with my mom and sis. i saw the christmas special of the rockettes. it was really well done and pretty. i can't believe miss gail useda be one b/c shes the shit and well yea she rocks but she's one cool cat..and yea i dunno. so yea then after it we walked around, went to times square, shopped, went to toys r us and saw the carousel =D, went to central park and rode in a horse and carriage ((cute huh)), and to rockafeller center. it was a cute family get together for the girls. what can i say my mom and sis rock. ((loser)). so yea i got home around 9 and just was tired as shit and went home.

tomorrow i may go on the toys for tots motorcyle run on my dad's bike b/c my mom's taking hers. i dont know if i wanna go or not but i'll probably end up going b/c i have nothing else better to do on a sunday and i don't feel like finding shit to do.

Friday-was the pep rally bitches =D. I was spirited out like a loser and I did the tug-a-war with mike r, gary r, joel c, elyse and maxine. we won against the freshmen and juniors but we knew we were gonna lose against the seniors. so our plan was to let go after like 10 seconds of pulling. but it didnt really work out well due to the fact that whoever yelled go for us yelled go right after larkin did haha so elyse was like still holding on and she was embarrassed although no one noticed it and she continues to remind me about it. she cracks me up.
*night*-it was the bonfire and dance. i went with max, gret, and dan and like usual the bonfire is beat and u just sit there watching a fire and it sucked b/c it was really muddy. the dance was overly beat than normal and the dj sucked personally. i mean it was fun gang banging people with max and ctina but man i think we did it to everyone there basically! sheesh lol. hah me, katie, elyse and audro also did the ""el baile del queso"" for the remembrance of the spanish class...yea we were cool? not hah o well. me and tam tam also did our slow dancing dance and me and jenna lewkowicz who came back reminesced and did our dance//handshake. then after it me and max went to larristers and naters with drew. and just sat around being dookies and playing on the piano. me and max went home around 130ish and i slept over.

Saturday-woke up and walked home b/c max had work. it was a very lovely 30ish minute walk b/c of a very nice autumn day haha wat a loser i am. then i basically slept and then got ready for the game that i went with max. we basically watched and met up around with a few people. i watched the halftime shit with the love my life ms. jenna lewkowicz.  and dan. me and max walked around finding stuff to do at night and we ended up going to larrister and nater's house again with drew, eric, jimmy, jerry, kyle z, nicki, brian, and ryan and thas all i remember. tiff and katie visited as soon as we got there for like 5 minutes and then left but tiff later visited again. haha basically everyone was being dumbasses the whole time and played on the guitar, silly stuff int eh basement, and messing around with the strobe light.. haha that thing is crazy man but they scare me especially with the scare hand puppet =x.  me and max also discussed degrassi of course and watched parts of the new episode and tried to explain it. then later brian drove me and max to her house after dropping off eric and jimbo. we just chilled and talked a bit.

Sunday-woke up at like 8 and had church then work. i forget who i worked with but i remember it was pretty busy o yea! i worked with jazmine, diana, char char, amanda and gret! it was pretty fun though. i later came home and slept as i always do.

"event","heyy buddies..yea long time no write huh?  so i've been a little bit busy forgive me.

uh i guess ill start with rachael coming up. she came up on tuesday and met me at the mall after work. i think tini and adam came over and we just chilled here, walked to the park and watched them be stupid. the next day tori came from s. jersey and we went to the mall and met up with greta. we walked around a bit and thas about it. we stayed up til about 530 and woke up at like 2 and rob, adam and tini came over and we played pool, sat outside and played with chalk on my driveway =D ((all the cool kids do it)). we went to bed around ehh 4 maybe and i had work 12-5 so they stayed here and swam and all. that night we went to upper merions first football game against norristown. they had lots of fun obsessing over the many hott guys at our school ((somehow i just don't see how they find so many b/c i only saw like a 10..but yea..odd)) and staring at guys butts. o well gosh i swear u woulda thought they never seen a guy before b/c it felt like 9/10 guys were hot.. haha funny anyway. we stayed up til about ehh i think 3 again and i had work 12-5 yet again b/c i switched with tom. sean, tiki man, and jordan were spose to come over but they couldnt so adam and tini did and we just chilled here, looked at the yearbook, watched my brother and his friends catch bugs and put them in a huge spider web while spider attacked it and played pool/texas hold em. me and tor watched 10 things i hate about you after they left and rache went home earlier that day. today tori left and i went to dave and busters with the lovely c*tina toscani! i love her. we had tons of fun telling the people it was her birthday, driving cars, playing skeeball/arcade games, looking at the hott guy in the yellow shirt, and scouting out for boys. oh and of course getting all that candy which went to waste lol. good times! i missed hanging out with my loviee! it was a great day to spend the last night of summer ((bleh dont remind me)).

so basically this whole week since rache came and tori left was guys, guy's butts, baking brownies, eating chicken//french fries at 3 in the morning, ordering food, playing pool, making up our own game of pool, gettin tori scared, watchin mothman prophesies, and having tons of fun!

well im out i didnt feel like detailing the entry b/c no1 is really gonna read it anyway. o yea did anyone noticed i changed my lj icon and font. woohoo! yea im cool you  know it. credit to tor for helping me figure out how. hah. 

_-jen-_

PS Tara couldnt come which made me and Tor really depressed but its okay shes gonna visit during winter and maybe Thanksgiving Break. Can't wait to see Tor and the rest of the Cruisers again <33

PPS I just remembered c*tinas mom and boyfriend swore that they took a picture of the hott boy in the yellow striped shirt..i wonder if they really did. hmm..o yea and c*tina adores men in striped shirts haha.

PPPS. ((if thas one)) i usually wanna go back to school like a week before school starts, but this year i'm definitely not looking forward to it. you know how people sometimes cry on the last day of school? well yea i'm probably gonna cry on the first day. this was the best summer yet and thanks to all those who contributed to it:: njspers, admiral ts 2004, fabb fourr, my family, friends from um, philly people, and shore kids and everyone else who i forgot =x . love yas thanks again."

"event","hey guys.
lemme tell you about the shore and new brunswick//princton.

so on i think monday, greta, max and i left with gret's family to the shore of wildwood. fifi and jane of the vandergeese's came with us. we basically through the whole week til friday night hung out, met kids, messsed around, went to the boardwalk, went to the beach, messed around on the beach//boardwalk, babysat, and had a bunch of fun. that includes making pictures on the beach, writing things on the beach, doing cheer stunts, max and i singin random songs on our chairs, licking//humping the monsters from that zombie world thing, make out boy, max and i getting married to brian, charlies angels, jippin the pizza lady and coming out of the bathroom us 3 with a chic staring at us oddly, and so much more crap that was wayy fun. i left on friday with the vandergeese's and packed friday night to leave saturday for another adventure.

on saturday, my dad took me and audro to north brunswick, nj  (near princeton) which took about 1 1/2 hour to kelly s.'s house! we had a fun time talking and reminiscing about njsp and looking at pictures. then we left for church and then to bennigans for the big suprise which was me and audro. about only 7 people showed up b/c many people were unavailable with a few going to the wrong bennigans ((cough cough kristin lol)) but it was way fun. kelly, me, audro, quinn, lauren, jeff, matt, lynn, and sara had such a great time in cvs, singin happy bday to kelly's brother, messing with the waiter and just having fun and again reminscing. that night, audro, quinn and i slept over kel's and we watched movies, played extreme ping pong with her brother, made her brother a special bday surprise, did the cheer/dance vids, and a bunch of other funness stuff!

on sunday, we all went over quinn's and cynthia came over and we just danced around, listened to music and talked while we got ready for kelly d's and moe's sweet 16. varga and adam came over for some pizza and it was great seeing the 2 greatest counselors in the worlddd!! varga loved visiting us with the spider and girly party! we wrote adam a note since hes leaving for a year to nc for habitat for humanity. he loved it and he knows it! that night we went to kelly/moes sweet 16 and the royce brooks gulph club! it was really fun and pretty there! i saw tim, alyssa, emily, spence, amanda, annie, kristin, and meaghan there!! it was so great to sing elias with them again and just to see them. me and audro left at 11 to go back to our gay homes in gulph mills =/. but i had so much fun at the party! happy sweet 16 to kelly and maureen again!!! 

i didn't notice how much i really missed those kids til now. they are the greatest group of people i've ever met and we've had so many great times in that week. and we have more to had after this weekend. it was so refreshing to see you guys and during spring break or next summer you guys must visit us for a week. whenever you guys are in the kop area give me a call!! call me anytime! i love you guys so much and i cant wait to see you guys again!!!!!!! <33njsp week 2 rocks out <33

so i think i may go to bed soon due to the fact that i hafta wake up at 7 for a doctors. i probably will go to the mall at night since i have an interview thingy at coldstone. i can go from 2-close so yea.. so yes i may be joining the coldstone cult. haha niceee. its either that or joining maxine at the golf course..not sure yet. im out later days

i guess ill just tell you the time campin with g-unit and her family.  on thursday night, me and audro went to the mall and met up with tini. at around 10, we met gret at her work and then walked up to the movies to see ""harold & kumar go to whitecastle"". some funny shit if ya ask me..pretty stupid yet funny. haha i was laughin..alot. it put me in the mood for white castle excluding the fact i never went there. my dad owns a business in cherry hill so the next time i go to work with him ill make him go. but yea if you're in for a laugh over a stupid movie then go hah.

we woke up on friday and drove abou 2 1/2 hours to uhh i dont even know wat its called but ""Yogi Campsite"" near Knoebels ((about 20 minutes away if even)). It was based on Yogi the bear and so when we got there we set up the campsite and our tent..which took a while haha but was funn.  so later me gret and her little cousin, katie, took a walk around the camp. we saw some funny signs ((""yogi loves your kids"" and ""buts"")) hah, stole some corn from a cornfield and got stalked by a fat old man in a golfcart that we swore was gonna rape us.  it started pouring and thundering and lightening and our tent was drenched with all our stuff. we hadda somehow dry it which didnt work and everyone slept in cars or in the popup tent thing;however, me and gret dealt with it and braved by ourselves in the huge tent on our blow up mattress. were such true campers!! grr. lol

we woke up the next day and hadda clean out the whole tent and hang everyhing on a line to dry. her family and i went to knoebels that night. we went on a few rides, played a few games, got food, and searched for boys. theres so many hawt guys that work there =X. ""guys what are u doing"" ""mom were busy okay!? well meet up with you laer"" ""are u lookin at those girls"" ""uh no mom were uhh looking for something okay!"" haha silly silly silly. after we left we hung out with her cousin katie and chilled at the tent.

saturday we chilled out and left at night because a hurricane was supposed to come. tonight i have no idea what were doing except for packing and maybe going out. tomorrow they're leaving for the shore and i hope my sister goes down and comes up before next saturday b/c i cant go unless i get home by friday/saturday because im leaving again for more vacation. yay. ill write more about that later when i come back. soon tara & tori are coming up too and maybe rache. yay!
later days.

anywayy, so on saturday me and rae played sonic and then went to maxine's. gret, adam, ryan, kevin, chris, and brian showed up and we just watched malibu's most wanted, went to the park until ryan and adam decide to try and light a bonfire and got yelled at by random people, and then watched sixth sense and just chilled. later kev, chris, brian and bill slept over but it didn't really work out so me and max only got like 3 hours of sleep which sorta sucked b/c we were goin to six flags on sunday.

well at around 10 me and max picked up audro to go to six flags! it was wayy mucho funno. we went on the great american scream machine, batman & robin ((in which me and max banged heads and laughed so hard)), freefall, nitro ((where we met these kids from montgomery that knew spencer and tim from njsp!)), watched the dolphin/SEA LION!!! show, superman and i forget the rest. but yea it was fun! we got hennas and we also went bungee jumping on the lying down one like the one they have down the shore were u sorta bungee/swing. it was 18 bucks each for 3 people. haha it was so funny maxine couldnt find the pulley thing she was like panicking, then audro was like raping my arm and wouldnt let go when we could, then we sang on it, did my calling people thing, and it was scary but really fun! we got keychains too although me and max look like we were posing//smiling for it but we didnt even know and audros like haha o god! hah then before we left we rode the log flume like 4 times and met this random little kid named joey at like 930 at night. then maxine ran off to get a towel adn audro drug me onto the bridge in which i gave up and we hugged each other when we got splashed by 50,000 gallons of water which was really cold! anyway fun times! whew

this is basically what i did..stayed up all night, hung out with friends, watch my sis/bro/friends get drunk and make fun of them, swim, snorkel at coral reefs, snorkel at a shipwreck, went glassbottom boat thingy, kayaked in the ocean, went to 2 beaches, explored the beaches//caves, went in the clear water, danced, sang, texas hold 'em & egyptian ratscrew, ate at buffet and formal dinners, went to the shows at night, played bingo, did karaoke, did an allnighter, made up dances, did impressions of people, ordered room service at 3 o clock in the morning, met many people, explored bermuda, took pictures, played extreme ping pong, rat raced so many flights of stairs, road the elevators, had wayy too much fun, relaxed, watched clouds//made pictures out of them, played dare or..well dare, ran around with alien penises (hah tara), danced with the sisters (tori), talked about nakedness (cody), broke things hah no comment, listened to people play the guitar (matt and christian), laughed a whole damn lot that i lost my voice (matt//joe), learned about bermuda, went kayaking in caves, and well yea alot more i just can't really think of. it seriously was so much fun with my family and the new friends i made. we've all became so close and its amazing how much i miss them.

this cruise (celebrity cruiseline's boat ""horizon"") was amazing..i had so much fun and imiss everyone so much i can't stand it. every little thing i do reminds me of them. oh yea alright uh huh nakedd. jim carey movies, jack black movies, nakedness, butterfly effect, beyonce, catwoman, indiana jones, green day, wonderwall, heres to the night, singing, dancing, running, ping pong, cards, every little thing does. i miss you guys so much and it was such a great experience.

i miss bermuda the country too..they officially have the worse drivers in world history and you have no idea. theres only like 4 different kind of cars ont he island and everything else is mopeds/scooters. one car per family and everyone has a damn scooter. hah with their narrow streets and crazy drivers they must have a high automobile accident rate. me and my sister sorta bonded..okay i lied we always been close but we just hung out a lot since we went to lunch everyday since we never made breakfast in time ((overslept)), went swimming together, shopping together, same room, and everything else..well okay maybe we didnt bond i lied b/c we always been pretty close so screw what i said.

but yea overall i had a great time and i wouldnt really wanna give you a day to day thing of what happened b/c then id just get into detail..become majorly depressed..then majorly pissed and delete this wholet hing since i wrote it..and then then get pissed that i deleted it. plus everything is just like mixed together in my head to like a whole big mish mosh mess. but its a damn rockin mess!! 

i cant wait to get my pix developed.. i think thursday im goin to a carnival/fair with sean (butterfly/malvern one) and then taras comin up from spet 3rd-6th to stay with me and maybe even tiffany and tori lives near cherry hill so it should work out well! and were tryin to get cody/sean to stay at seans(butterfly). somehow we'll work it!

so yea on friday night i went to greta's and we drove down the shore to wildwood. when we got there we had an american pie marathon hah and matched some of the guys that reminded us of our guy friends which made us crack up hah. shermanator=hah no names.

on saturday greta, her mom, brother, and sister and well i went to the waterpark. that australian man loved to sing to us!! then we watched the christmas in july parade with jack sparrow! the man of my dreams! =D around 9 we went to the boardwalk with lou (which i knew from st. johns and met again..also joe (greta's mom's boyfriend's nephew hah)) and his friends matt (knows my cousin), tom, pat (knows one of my best friend rachael), sean and rocky. first, they went on the log flumes and then we all walked around. hah then they all got their palms read and their outcomes were so funny. lou married 3 times, matt not getting married and being successful//or going to jail hah, and rocko with being very sensitive hah. how cutee! we walked back to lou's house around 11 i guess and he made us mixed drinks. greta on the way home swore that we were gonna get caught past curfew and then caught drinking while we walked to wawa. hahah then at the same time matt screamed OMG!! and im like WEED! hahahah it was so friggin weird and hes like i smell that too!!! hahaha anywayyyyy but yea so lou made us mixed drinks while we watched snl even though grezta didnt have one but o well next time. we walked home and watched americn pie 2 again even though it kept screwing up.

on sunday, gret and i walked to the marina and she went jet skiing with sean but i just stayed back and talked with rocko and tom even though i got asked by lou and matt 2983749 times. but hey it looked like it was gonna rain and i didnt feel like being wet even though in the end i got screwed. ask why? yea b/c when we went back to the house; lou, tom, matt, and sean locked me outside for like 20 minutes and drenched me with soapy water (hot and cold) and matt tried throwing eggs at me but i caught the one so it didnt break. then i got a shower while greta got whipped. hah o well. after talking about corny pick up lines and destroying joe's house they left and me and gret cleaned up. later we went to joe's mom's house to eat dinner and talked to lou. we rented bad santa and hated it except for the adorable chubby kid haha and its sorta okay ending..although i didnt understand half of it. we then watched phone booth and like 4 episodes of degrassi =D. 

today we left and cleaned, etc. i came home and went to crew..rowed and well thas basically it. but yea my birthday is on friday. yay i guess? o well.. ill write again later before i go on the cruise to bermuda on saturday..later days

Well now since I actually feel like writing..well I don't really but I know if I don't do it now I never will, but anyway I'll tell you, you lucky person you, about the wonderful amazing week of Summer of Service. My week was June 27th to July 3rd! 

For all of you who doesn't know what summer of service/njsp ((new jersey service projects)), it is basically a group of about thirty kids from different schools/churches that stay at st. joseph's seminary in princeton, nj for a week and get split up into work groups and go to activity sites in which they help out the community.  I worked at TASK (Trenton Area Soup Kitchen) with Kelly, Tim, Matt, Emily and Tara with Mrs. Sanford as our counselor.  We woke up at 7 and had to go up to our dorms at 12 in which we didn't fall asleep at all right away (obviously lol). We worked from 9 to about 4ish and from then on you did activities like dodgeball, volleyball, badminton, ultimate frisbee, soccer, etc. or just hung out. There was no form of media (radio, tv, etc.) for a week which I didn't even notice because there was always stuff to do but yea.  Every 31 of us bonded so well it was amazing and unbelievable and the counselors rocked! It was great to see Varga!

You raise your head, beneath the sun
But your boys they lie so close to you
Do you dare get up and wake the two?
Oh Elias, I see you there, at work in the daytime.
Do you think you could answer 
All the questions in the world in just one word? 
I think you could.

Chorus: If you die will I get word that you're gone?
will I hear it in passing conversation?
will I stop short and fall to the ground?
Distance is short when your hand carries what your eye found.
Hold my hand just one more time,
to see if you're really gonna need me.
Hold my hand just one more time,

Honest and Manuel, well you know, they're at school now
Given the chance that their father's never seen
see whats beyond Section 17.
And in ten years, when you look back at your boys,
well you know they've grown way taller
than the tallest sugar cane in the field.

Chorus

I see your wife, She stands stooped over by the fire outside.
And I see your boys and when they look up,
you know i think they got their mother's eyes.
'Cause she looks so proud. She looks so happy.
She looks so proud. She looks so happy. Yeah!

I miss you guys from NJSP way too much. I have a totally new outlook on life. Either tomorrow or Monday, I'll write about my times and what we did and about everyone. I have never met so many amazing people in my life! I love you guys and I will never forget you!

"event","so yea i haven't wrote in a while so i figured why not do some catchin up..this will be a long entry.

[[friday]]-after school, i went to greta's with michelle and people came over and hung out there. first there was craig and his 3 friends who i dont know ((sorry)) and then they left around 830ish i guess and dan, joe, ryan, victor, and chris came over and messed around. it was fun i guess..very strange and disturbing and well interesting..

[[saturday]] woke up at 6ish for sat 2 bio which i don't know how i did on it. i then went to dorney and hung out with audie, greta, ed, dan, tj and andrew basically the whole time. it was reallly cold but fun at the same time. stupid bitches bullshitted and made us leave even though more than about 3/4 of the class or more wanted to stay til 730 instead of 530. but i still had fun.  when i got home i got packed to go to rache's in roxborough to meet my sister there. then my mom drove me down even though rache wasnt there b/c she didnt know i was coming down. she didnt even come home that night..ugh that dumbass is ruining her life but lets not get into that. so i hung out with my sister's friends who i've known for about my whole life and we went to some college kids party at about 1ish after the naked bike race ((which was funny and somewhat crowded for soem odd reason)). we got back at like 3 and i couldnt fall asleep til about 430.

[[sunday]]-i woke up at 930 due to sirens in my ear wondering why are there sirens at my house. then i had no idea where i was and then remembered i slept there. the sirens were from teh first round of the bike race and i knew that another 9 laps were coming of it so i figured i had to stay awake even though i got only about 5 hours of horrible sleeping.  i hung out with my sister's friends the whole day and we just chilled and drank a bit. amanda (rache's sis) was convinced that i was drunk off my ass even though i wasnt silly her. so at 630 we took the 9 (septa) down to 4th and walnut and walked to the ferry. we took across teh delaware and walked to the tweeter for my blink 182/no doubt concert.  i went with meg (my sis), liz and amanda. when i got there, the living end was already playing and i found ctina t and dayve p there and we hung out the whole time. we missed one song by blink and we went onto the lawn. it was fun as shit!!! grand poppyappa was dancin the night away!! and the boy at the rock show! <3 hahaha dayve dayve dayve. so then i found my sister and her friends and we went to take the ferry across around 1 when the concert got over. after waiting at 4th & walnut for til about 145 we called septa and they wouldnt answer. finally we got the answer machine saying that the next 9 was at 545 in the morning and the next 27 was at 653. so yea we had no money and no ride home in the middle of center city. so we walked to broad and chestnut and about 15 blocks until we had enough moeny to barely get us too amandas. the taxidriver got lost and we arrived at amandas at 4ish and i got home by 430. 

[[monday,tuesday, wednesday]]-on monday i went to school extremely tired for my wc and spanish final. then on tuesday greta, kevin k, and i walked to mcds for period 1 then i had my english final. wednesday, the last day, i went to my bio final and then walked to michaels with kendra, ctina, greta, and jon. twas funny.

[[and finally now]]on the last day of school we should be happy right? wrong..well at least for me. im not sad that schools over..i love it. but ive just become really depressed all of a sudden and no, its not well what you may think hah. but yea i dunno maybe im just being a silly billy goose drops or something.. i hate being sad (so does everyone but still) well im out because yea.."

so yea no more crew..im sorta happy yet sad because i know i will miss it but then we have the fun clinic/camp thing with jamie in the summer..so that'll be fun.  good luck to the jv girls 4 and jv girls double at nationals in florida this week! im sure u guys will do great! so i think this week my cousins from south carolina are coming up but im not sure but still.

audies dad picked us up and we dropped off necoli and me nd audie went to genuardis. we saw brian and he screamed heyyy really loud and it was odd but funny hah. then i saved her but with my genuardi's card ..okay my parents. then we picked up necoli and helped audie clean her pool area. i went home and cleaned my room and went to church.
then dave (dayna) picked me up and we went to roberts and swung on the swings, went to audies. tami and dayna slept over. and well now its today and im gonna go help my mom clean the pool.

  So i just got back from audies with a crapload of crew people and other people which i am so corny that i will name..audie (obviously), dayna, tam tam, jenna, necoli, kevin k, dave, jim, jerry, ale, juan, bill, kevin w, kyle, steph m, whitney, and i think thas it..i hope so. but yea it was fun singing the spice girls at first, then being the judge of the rolldown the hill races, messing with audies computer, etc.  twas fun though.
   We had the Upper Merion Invitational Regatta which you shoulda came to because i love you and it would have been extremely nice and supportive. We got first in our heat by stupid Belleville ran into Nutley and they clashed oars so we had to restart, but o well because well we got first in the heat. we were so happy and we were gonna scream/cry except for the fact that we were all dry heaving and i can barely speak now anyway. then on our final at 4, we received 2nd b/c Belleville's stupid ass ran into our boat in the middle of the race that so close that my oar was scraping their boat and i hope they have a huge ass dent.  yea i mean but i swear we coulda got first b/c at the end it was pretty close and the clash due to the jackasses made us screw up at 10 strokes of a power. i was so pissed at the end i didnt want to dock b/c i wanted to call the officials but of course we didnt b/c no1 ever listens to jen anyway b/c jens stupid.
  well gooses, im leaving you now b/c im overwhelmingly tired and still a tiny bit angry. grr we could have corny medals right now. later days.

"event","So yea, I haven't written in a while do to the fact of my boring, lame, stupid, ""crew-filled"", pointless life.  every single day this week (except for monday at which i did not feel so well) I have had lame school, stupid crew practice, and then sometimes dance.  nothing really happened this week due to the fact that it sucked majorly and it was extremely well again lame.
I hate girls and their stupid petty problems and drama; however, i always still help them out.  O well, I guess I sometimes go through those stupid pieces of crap, too. Screw it..I know this is not true but it feels like they think that they have the worse life in which they don't. ((definitely not saying that i do b/c i have an okay life, but yea compared to the 24,000 people dying a day of starvation..yea i think have a bit more problems bud)).
I wanted to cry yesterday;however, well i didnt because i hate crying. This was because the loving, great Mr.Varga (who now wants us to call him Matt because he's not a student teacher anymore)left us.  I told him there is no such thing as ""goodbyes"" and that he shouldn't leave but he had to! bleh it was sad but we had a party anyway.  He gave us packets with a note to each of us, a cd, quotes,etc.  Varga rocked, but i get to see him during the summer of service.
i just got back from the corny crew dance that wasn't so bad except for some stupid crap like always that seems to go on during social events/gatherings. but overall it was okay/fun hanging out with all different people and the band wasn't bad at all.
im leaving you now because i am a bit tired and my bed is calling me soon and i have crew practice and a spaghetti dinner for it. later. -jen-"

"event","Whoa! I'm so proud and happy of my boat! We got first out of six boats on our Manny Flick today in Philly at Boathouse Row.  We were screaming at the end and on the verge of like crying because we were so happy. I think it's because we had Jamie as a coach yesterday.  So good job to our boat of Audrey, me, Becky M., Steph M, and Gab Toto! We rocked!

Also good job to Tori and Shannon on their first place of sculling, Gracja's Boys Novice Boat, and Bill's Boys Novice Boat. You guys did great!  Great job to all other boats who raced today.

well just got back from crew practice with 7 new blisters..whoa this rocks :/  yesterday was fun b/c i hung out with christina t, katie b, lisa h and some others yesterday at different time for diversity day.  i was trying to fall asleep with ash s and ali k during the 2 hour friggin assembly on sleep. gosh i swear thas so pointless, i didn't learn one new thing. i felt bad for the lady though, i know she tried to keep us interested. after that, the ""i chose to stay"" guy came in about teaching in philly. HE ROCKED! he was a cool dude! then we went around to different places and me & katie sang with mr. varga where i was going to shoot myself b/c i have no balls. but it wasnt that bad after i did although i felt like well really retarded and well dumb. ((big vocabulary huh)). then at the end of the day i wasnt in any pictures..but jenna was! so i screamed yea jenna..but then everyone looked back at me and i acted clueless and looked around.

at crew yesterday, we had sculling championships ((just in our school/team)) it was fun.  then i went to my dads suprise party and it was wonderful.  rachael came and slept over. haha my sister was dead drunk last night and i thought i was gonna cry laughing so hard. today at practice jamie coached us and it was a pretty hard practice but i liked it.

"event","Hey..sorry I haven't written in here for about 3-4 days, i was a tid bit busy.  So let's see what i've done in the past days.

Monday-Nothing really at school, it felt boring to be back. I feel asleep in WC and took a vertebrate id test for bio. i think i did okay in that.  at crew, it rained so we hadda do 3 9:00 minute pieces on the ergs, rigoring the boats, and bench pulls, i did 1-2 b/c i told them that i was gonna finish on tuesday w/ the rest of my boat b/c most of them were missing. at dance, i had ballet and pointe with miss becky and after pointe, my toes hurt horribly. i hate my dance for that class there always so formal i guess.

Tuesday-Another long day at school and again fell asleep in WC during Ghandhi.  in english we were told that we have a random presentation for romeo and juliet and in bio we played classroom casino. at crew, it rained again and we did an indian run (last person runs in front, then the next goes up front,etc.) and it wasnt that bad at all b/c there was 8 ppl in my group. then we erged for either 20 minutes.

Wednesday- fell asleep in wc, took the at pac during spanish, prepared for the r&j presentation in english and bio test. i think i did good on that and the atpac i got one right hah. o well im dumb.  at crew, we went swimming and played water polo for 30 minutes..that was fun! at ballet with tim, we finished our dance and boy, is it pretty! i love his dances..they're o so pretty.

Thursday-today! spanish ms. satterfield made us do worksheets b/c she hates me..not really but she thinks i talk alot so i drew on her board instead with katie t! wc-finished ghandhi movie i fell alssep for i think 5 minutes. computer apps- o goodness boring class. english- we did our r&j presentation and i was juliet..bleh i hadda wear my sister's renaissancish jr. prom dress. then at bio/lab we played dance dance karoake! that was funny. in algebra, mr funsten moved our test to today so i took that and finished early so me, alyssa and jenn went to mr. werners to watch them do karoake.
at crew, me audie and steph d. took a 30 minute run and when we got back we sculled(2 oars instead of one). i dont really like it though, i think its really hard and complicated. bleh..o well. 

at crew today, monica saw a duck and she said it was swimming oddly and sinking. so i look back and i swore it only had one leg! so i started fake crying and screaming at george(coach) to save it because it was going to drown. but then i saw another ducky, johnny, and i told him to go save the other one. so then i started pouting and like screaming and my whole boat was cracking up and george told me to quiet down. so i asked him ""how would you like it if you were getting raped and no one was there to save you?!"" and he just looked at me and laughed..hah it was funny.


whoa..tomorrow i don't have any classes b/c of diversity day! this rocks. i think i'm hanging out with christina t. and were meeting up with people later. hopefully i have fun though. it sucks tomrorow is my friend elyse's party but i can't go b/c i have to go down philly to a hall for my dad's suprise party. hopefully it will be fun b/c rachael is going and i havent seen her since september!! well im leavin you. later

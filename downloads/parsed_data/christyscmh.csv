"event","Is it just me, or is Ishmael absolutely hilarious!  He's quirky and he has sarcasm that would make him my best friend if he were a real person.  He's making this story for me.  My favorite, still has to be when he was describing Queequeg and referred to him as ""George Washington, cannibalistically developed.""

Then of course, during Queequeg's Ramadan, Ishmael is respectful but still thinking in the back of his head ""As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards the nightfall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants workshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.""

Then he starts freaking out thinking that Queequeg has been killed or something because he's been in one position all day long and at nightfall he's still just sitting there.  He has an Alice moment from The Last of the Mohicans, ""For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.""  Then Queequeg turns comical himself in this chapter once his Ramadan is over, ""But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.""  You'd think he'd say a little more after all the freaking out that Ishmael did the night before.

Eh, I didn't really have anything puzzling that was bothering me about the book just yet, so I figured I'd comment on how amusing it is for me so far.  Nothing spectacular or incredibly studious, I'm just really enjoying the book so far.  How about you guys?"

"event","There are references throughout the novel that are subtle but hold a more obvious meaning.  One in particular is the terribly long description of the chickens in Chapter X starting on page 107.

""...that feathered society the hens, a breed of whome, as we have already said, was an immemorial heirloom in the Pyncheon family.""

I took this as of course, being representative of the family legend altogether.  Apparently there is a curse on the house and so far this curse had touched every member of the family to follow Colonel Pyncheon.

""They had been set at liberty, and now roamed at will about the garden; doing some little mischief, but hindered from espace by buildings, on three sides, and the difficult peaks of a wooden fence, on the other.""

Obviously this is a clear resemblance of the House and those who reside in it.  Hepzibah and Clifford of course, can never leave and the peaks of the wooden fence are symbolistic of the gables of the house.

""...but by no possibility can there have been other fowls, of such odd appearance and deportment as these ancestral ones.""  

The first few chapters already tell us that the neighbors and the people living in the town already think that Hepzibah has the worst scowl ever.  Despite them being unaware as to why she looks that way, it just strikes them as odd and she's outcasted because of this.

No lesser sense of the infant fowl's importance could have justified, even in a mother's eyes, the perserverance with which she watched over its safetly, ruffling her small person to twice it's proper size, and flying in everybody's face that so much as looked towards her hopeful progeny.""

Here again we have another reference to Hepzibah.  She cares for Clifford as though she were his mother.  It's apparent that this is her sole purpose in life, and for the most part it makes her happy, or so at least she was incredibly excited upon his arrival to the house anyways.  She also ruffled her feathers quite a bit when the Judge was insistent upon seeing Clifford after manipulating his way pasy Pheobe in Chapter VIII.

""No lower estimate could have vindicated the indefatigable zeal with which she scratched, and her unscrupulousness in digging up the choicest flower or vegetable, for the sake of the fat earth-worm at its root.""

Here we have Pheobe, with her sunny disposition and zealous lifestyle.  She's always being referred to something having to do with sunshine and flowers and for this ""hen"" to be digging up the choicest flower is representative of her picking the perfect rose from the garden.

""Phoebe, after getting acquainted with the old hen, was sometimes permitted to take the chicken in her hand, which was quite capable of grasping its cubic inch or two of body.""

This of course marks when Phoebe shows up on Hepzibah's doorstep and once she agrees to let her stay, allows Phoebe to start warming up to her.  She gets so entirely comfortable with her that she eventually allows Phoebe to care for Clifford as well.

""Thus unscrupulously did the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance, perhaps, of an ancient feathered race, with no better end than to supply her brother with a dainty that hardly filled the bowl of a teaspoon."" 

This statement was where Hepzibah took that last egg and made Clifford breakfast with it.  This passage says to me that Hepzibah wanted to end the generation of hends, in otherwards the Pyncheon's because although her family was ancient, it has brought nothing but curses and possibly she was channeling her feelings about her own family through that of the ""ancient feathered race.""

And finally, not such a great ending but I was trying keep the quotes in consecutive order as they appeared in the text, we have this last passage:

""Hereupon, the offended fowl stalked away on his long stilts, and utterly withdrerw his notice from Phoebe and the rest of human nature; until she made her peace with an offering of spice-cake, which, next to snails, was the delicacy most in favor with his aristocratic taste.""

This of course being Judge of the novel. Getting offended because perhaps, Hepzibah wouldn't accept his help and strutting with that stupid grin on his face and not wanting to make amends unless the situation suited him.  Acting as though he's better than everyone else when we all clearly see him for what he really is, a big jackass."

"event","I have made little notes here and there and also have done a little research regarding several of the main characters that have made the most appearances so far in the book.  I was reading a little about Phoebe whose name is apparently derived (not the character herself, just the name in general) from a Greek word called ""phoibos"" which means shining.  I found this extremely relevant and interesting as the author typically refers to Phoebe alongside of rays of sunshine and flowers.

""She was very pretty; as graceful as a bird, and graceful much in the same way; as pleasant, about the house, as a gleam of sunshine falling on the floor through a shadow of twinkling leaves, or as a ray of firelight that dances on the wall while the evening is drawing night."" page 59

""Here's a girl that will never end her days at my farm!  Bless my eyes, what a brisk little soul!""  (Uncle Venner) page 60 

Phoebe also reminds me a bit of Cora.  She's a very good natured girl and thinks positively in most situations.  She's so far been the most admirable character in the novel.

Here I was thinking what a cute old couple Hepzibah and Clifford will turn out to be only to find out that they are in fact, brother and sister.  I'm ashamed at my original thoughts on what might be their outcome in the book!  The author really did a good job in making me think that I was about to read on about a regular Romeo and Juliet.

""She watched the fish with as much care, and minuteness of attention, as if- we know not how to express it otherwise- as if her own heart were on the gridiron, and her immortal happiness were involved in it's being done precisely to a turn!""  page 72

""...Clifford fell asleep...Hepzibah siezed the opportunity to preuse his face, more attentively than she had yet dared to do.  Her heart melted away in tears; her profoundest spirit sent forth a moaning voice, low, gentle, but inexressively sad.  In this depth of gried and pity, she felt that there was no irreverence in gazing at his altered, aged, faded, ruined face.""  page 83

I'm curious as to if that was really Hawthorne's intentions, to surprise the reader or was I the only one who was not expecting that?  Any thoughts?

Of course, I haven't held back my thoughts on what people may deem as ""poor Hepzibah"" however I must note here that even the author has called her so several times throughout the book.  

""Poor Hepzibah knew this truth, or, at least, acted on the instinct of it.""  page 79

""And yet there was nothing fierce in Hepzibah's poor old heart; nor had she. at the moment, a single bitter thought against the world at large, or one individual man or woman.""  page 33

Then there's Clifford.  He's not really demonstrating much of a different demeanor than ""poor Hepzibah.""  Prior to discovering their relation, I was thinking, wow, these guys are perfect for each other, they're both pretty miserable and because they are so emotional, they should be perfect for consoling one another all the time.  

""And then the unnerved man- he that had been born for enjoyment, but had met a doom so very wretched- burst into a woman's passion of tears.""  page 82

I know, I know, I'm being too hard on them..."

"event","Ok, I'm officially depressed.  How dreadfully oppressive Hepzibah's character is in this novel.  And I've only gotten through the first few chapters.  She's incredibly negative and horribly unstable.  She is also very emotional and for a sixty year old woman kind of has the emotional stability, or instability rather, of a teenager.  She's dreading the opening of the shop and panics at the last minute prior:

""The moment had arrived.  To delay longer, would be only to lengthen out her misery...This last act Hepzibah now performed, letting the bar fall, with what smote upon her excited her nerves as a most astounding clatter.  Then- as if the only barrier betwixt herself and the world had been thrown down, and a flood of evil consequences would come tumbling through the gap- she fled into the inner parlor, threw herself into the ancestral elbow-chair, and wept.""

Did I mention Hepzibah is also extremely dramatic and reminds me a little bit of Alice from the Last of the Mohicans!

Ahh...speaking of drama queen, I believe this is where I first was thinking, Alice, as I was reading:

""Success? Preposterous!  She would never think of it again!  The house might just as well be buried in an eternal fog, while all other houses had the sunshine on them; for not a foot would cross the threshold, nor a hand so much as try the door!""

In my reference to Hepzibah acting like a teenager, this was the perfect line that made me think of her as such:

""She was doubly tortured; - in part, with a sense of overwhelming shame, that strange and unloving eyes should have the privilege of gazing; - and, partly, becaise the idea occurred to her, with ridiculous importunity, that the window was not arranged so skillfully, nor nearly to so much advantage, as it might have been.  It seemed as if the whole fortune or failure of her shop might depend on the display of a different set of articles, or substituting a fairer apple for one which appeared to be speckled.""

She is taking the smallest thing, people passing by her shop and simply window shopping, as her having screwed up the window display and will ultimately be the reason behind her shop being doomed to failure.  This is a little ridiculous which is ironic because that exact word is used in this crazy little thought of hers.  Aside from that, she also resembles how teenagers think because she is taking the smallest thing, take a young female experiencing puppy love for example, and she's needlessly analyzing the hell out of it.  Let's add to the list of reasons why Hepzibah has managed to depress me in less than five chapters, that she lacks any sort of self-confidence whatsoever.

""But, at this instant, the shop-bell, right over her head, tinkled as if it were bewitched.  The old gentlewoman's heart seemed to be attached to the same steel-spring; for it went through a series of sharp jerks, in unison with the sound.""

This one is perfect.  How many of us as teenagers did this exact same thing when someone we were interested in or better yet, had a crush on, called us?  I certainly did. This is a great analogy for that instant where you were anticipating if it was really them calling.  Hepzibah was probably thinking, do I really have a customer???  They have yet to comment further on this mystery man that Hepzibah has supposedly waited all this time for.  I'm curious to see if perhaps, her reason behind acting this way is somehow tied to her feelings for him. 

To elaborate on her negativity, as if I really have to, when the window shoppers passed, they also made comments about her shop as well as the Pyncheon legend or what have you as to the generations that have lived in the house.  Of course, Hepzibah overhearing this falls apart, yet again:

""Success presented itself as an impossibility, and the hope of it as a wild hallucination.  Some malevolent spirit, doing his utmost to drive Hepzibah mad, unrolled before her imagination a kind of panorama, representing  the great thoroughfate of a city, all astir with customers.""

And where exactly is this woman's backbone?  How about telling these people exactly what they can go do? 

I don't know, but I'm already wanting to slap this woman through the pages of the book!  Perhaps its just me and I'm feeling a bit fiesty this evening...I'm not quite sure.  Either way, I'll respect my elders on this one and continue reading.  Stay tuned."

"event","I was extremely curious about the film, having never seen it, once I finished reading this book.  I've heard various reviews and opinions on it, however I had to see for myself what all the fuss was about.  I was surprised at how many things were changed from the original book.  I know there is a huge Hollywood reputation to uphold to capture the viewing audience, however I believe this movie differs from the book more than any other book to film comparison I have ever seen.  The characters also each take on entirely different personalities and storylines, and this is what I'd like to elaborate on first.

Alice Munro.  She's incredibly helpless and annoying and plays the role of the damsel in distress all to well in the book.  She's the perfect example of why men have a tendency to think of women as they do nails scratching down a blackboard.  

""Leave us not Duncan,"" said Alice; ""we cannot sleep in such a place as this, with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears!"" page 60

""We are lost!"" exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of Cora. page 84

There is another great instance of Alice acting as she usually does, overly dramatic and always requiring the spotlight to be on herself.  It is where Gamut is speaking about having visited Munro and how the Colonel was mentioning Cora.  Alice cannot resist and pipes in asking if her father said anything about her.  I couldn't find the exact quote but it's around the time where they first meet David Gamut.

Alice isn't portrayed nearly as dramatically in the film as she is in the book.  She basically remains fairly quiet throughout the movie unless there is fighting going on and undertandably she and Cora are frightened and huddled together during these scenes.  

Alice ends up falling for Uncas in the movie and vice versa.  While in the novel Cora is the one who is linked to Uncas and ultimately faces death with him, it is Alice who takes on this role in the film.  She has been captured by Magua and Uncas makes an unsuccessful attempt to save her.  He is killed and dropped off of a cliff by Magua and then Alice, who witnesses this, sees that her only way out of captivity, or perhaps the only way to be with Uncas is to throw herself off of the cliff as well, which she does.  An interesting note at this point in the movie, is Magua making a motion with his hand to try to get Alice to come down from the rock.  This demonstrated that not only had Alice taken on a different role with Uncas, but that Magua had also come to feel for Alice what he had felt for Cora in the novel and would ultimately never hurt her.

David Gamut is omitted entirely from the film.

Major Duncan Heyward is quite different in the film as well.  In my opinion, he is an arrogant bastard who plays off of his hurt ego when Cora rejects him.  This is another one of the storylines that is in huge contrast to the book.  I was reading an analysis of the characters in the novel from the Sparknotes.com website and it states that in the novel ""Heyward plays a slightly foolish man"", this is the understatement of the century regarding his demeanor in the movie.  Heywards interest lies with Cora and he's very persistent and open about that.  The story in the book as we all know is that Heyward shows interest in Alice and she does him as well.

""Ay-Cora!"" we are talking of your pretensions to Miss Munro, are we not, sir?""

""I-I-I, was not conscious of having mentioned her name,"" said Duncan, stammering.

""And to marry whome, then, did you wish my consent, Major Heyward,"" demanded the old soldier, erecting himself in the dignity of offended feeling.

""You have another, and not less lovely child.""

""Alice!"" exclaimed the father, in an astonishment equal to that with which Duncan had just repeated the name of her sister.

""Such was the direction of my wishes sir.""  page 158

This of course is where Munro discovers that Heyward is interested in Alice and not Cora in the book.  The film takes an entirely different approach.  Heyward also meets a different fate in the film.  He offers to take the place of Cora after she is captured by the Hurons in the movie.  They eventually accept and Heyward is burned alive in their village.  Hawk-eye takes mercy upon him similarly as he does in the movie with the enemy, and shoots him to end his life quickly.

""The lightening is not quicker than was the flame from the rifle of Hawk-eye; the limbs of the victim trembled and contracted, the head fell to the bosom, and the body parted the foaming waters, like lead, when the element closed above it, in its ceaseless velocity, and every vestige of the unhappy Huron was lost for ever.
No should of triumph succeeded this important advantage, but even the Mohicans gazed at each other in silent horror.  A single yell burst from the woods, and all was again still.  Hawk-eye, who alone apppeared to reason on the occasion, shook his head, at his own momentary weakness, even uttering his self-disapprobation aloud.""  page 75

Chingachgook is depicted in the novel as an exceptionally savage-like indian.  

""It is true, there were short and fleeting moments, when the fiery eyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the basilisk, through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he read by those short and deadly glances, the fate of the combat in the presence of his enemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on his devoted heard, its place was filled by the scowling visage of Chingachgook.""  page 114

""It was met by Chigachgook; whose knife passed across its throat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motion of the struggling victin, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it glided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life.  This deed of apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon the spirits of the travellers, like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood, heightened as it was, by the calm through steady resolution of the actors in the scene.""  page 47

In the film however, Chingachgook takes on a more strong but silent type of role.  He almost never speaks and when he does he's very gentle and is never really shown doing anything that could be considered incredibly savage in the movie.

Hawk-eye remains similar to his character in the novel.  He is not as savage or as harsh when speaking in the book for the exception of when Hawk-eye initially get to For William Henry and is speaking to a hard-headed Munro regarding the militia.  Still, there isn't a huge change in Hawk-eye in the film from that of the novel.

Cora, other than whom she becomes involved with, also stays pretty much the same in both forms of the story.  She is a very level-headed woman with a strong opinion and she is portrayed in both the novel and movie as admirable and mature.  

""Should we distrust this man, because his manners are not our manners, and that his skin is dark!"" coldly asked Cora.  page 22

""Cora regarded him not; but dropping on her knees; she raised her eyes and stretched her arms towards Heaven, saying, in a meek and yet confiding voice-
   ""I am thine! do with me as thou seest best!""  page 337

In the film, Cora falls for Hawk-eye and vice versa.  Because Alice is the one who is killed in her place as opposed to the novel, it is Cora and Hawk-eye experience a happily ever after ending in the movie.  The character analysis that I've been studying also mentioned something interesting that caught my eye especially after having watched the movie.  An analysis of Hawk-eye stated ""Hawk-eye demonstrated an almost obsessive investment in his own ""genuine"" whiteness.  Also, while Hawk-eye supports interracial friendship between men, he objects to interracial sexual desire between men and women.""  It's fascinating to see that the entire basis of Hawk-eye's character in the novel was changed for the film.  Of course, I have to repeat myself and say that this was clearly for Hollywood purposes, but I found that to be a really interesting change.

Overall I enjoyed the movie, although throughout the entire film I was literally commenting aloud about what was wrong, or out of order in comparison with the novel.  I, of course, enjoyed the book immeasurably more than the film.

Aside from that I believe the movie could have easily been made into a 4 hour film as opposed to it's 2 to 2 and a half hours which could have been a major improvement as to the quality.  I felt that it was tremendously rushed and I believe it would have been just as entertaining had they slowed down a bit and included more of the story as well as does it in the proper order."

"event","I've thought long and hard about this and I don't think that there is really a right answer to the question of whether it's a good thing or not to be civilized.  Sure there are benefits and downfalls to each which I will note in a minute, but just when I think that it might be a bad thing to be civilized, something else makes me think otherwise.  Let's weigh the pro's and con's shall we.

To be civilized in terms of urban comfort, technology and food production/distribution can all be considered good things, they only make life better right?  However, I wonder how many of these things have contributed to perhaps making us less civilized psychologically.  These are all things of leisure and I say this even including the food production because there are those who lack the privilege of having an adequate source of this, or even any at all.  These things have spoiled us.  They have made us wasteful. They have made us idolize material things and take everything and everyone for granted.  Family and friends are no longer the apple of everyone's eye because they have their huge flat screen TV, IPODS, computers and all else that can be considered hi-tech or urbanly comfortable to keep them occupied and ""fulfilled"" at least for the time being. While these things are a huge convenience and pleasing, don't they make us depreciate the things that really matter in life?  So in this instance, I would say civilization may not be such a great thing.  Con.

In terms of religion I believe that civilization can only be a good thing.  Most people who are spiritual and/or are actively involved in their religious services or what have you are pretty content in doing so.  Most religions, teach you how to better yourself and help others.  This can only be a good thing for the most part.  There are, of course, your twisted religions, take David Koresh for example, that have less than appealing things in mind for their members and specifically those who are not.  However, for most people religion is usually a good things.  Pro.

Ahh...sweet media.  I believe the news as a media source is good but does have an impact on people because they get their local, national and international information from this source on a regular basis, and usually it is their only source for such news.  The impact being that the news is where they hear and tend to believe things from whether or not it's the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  However, I don't believe that advertising and other things that are media related can really be to blame for people becoming as ""civilized"" as they are regarding materialistic things.  I mean there may be some great advertisements out there, but honestly did the man on the Best Buy commercial jump through the television set and hold a gun to your head demanding that you drive to their store and load up on all the latest technology?  I highly doubt it.  People have a choice in what they do.  This can't be considered a factor in exactly why we are as ""civilized"" or better yet, materialistic, as we are today.  But it's interesting how convenient the media has become to use as a reason why people have lost sight of the more important things in life.  It's not our fault...we are all helpless...let's simply justify it by blaming the media.  That's sounds good...yeah, we'll go with that!  Pro and Con?

There were other topics we covered in class that are considered elements of civilization including medicine, art, economy and agriculture.  None of these strike me as being things that could ever really be a bad thing, of course unless they're lacking.  I suppose that would mean that I consider these to be another good thing about civilization.  Pro.

Last but not least, the stable government.  I think we can all agree that there are a plethera of views as to exactly what this means.  Not only within the world, but within our own country.  No matter how stable one person sees our government, the next person could see the political wreck of the century.  Therefore to put having a stable government into the civilization catagory would really be impossible.  It's been proven that no matter what, never will there be a time where everyone is happy with the way they are being governed.  The cat gets this one.

So that's 3 for Pro and 2 for Con.  You do the math.  Although I do have to leave you with this.  While I may have weighed the issue with a final result of pro's taking the lead, I believe that the con's mentioned all have to do with the more valuable things in life, and no I'm not talking about that expensive digital camera you saw in last Sunday's sale paper.  The quality of life lies in how valuable it is to you. When you're on your deathbed and ready to leave this world, I guarantee that it is not how many toys and gadgets you have stuffed in that room, it's how many people you have surrounding you that are telling you what an impact you made on their lives and how much you mean to them that is going to make a difference and have you departing with a priceless amount of accomplishment and peace."

"event","I just viewed the powerpoint presentation on The Course of the Empire and found it spectacular!  The paintings themselves without any meaning behind them are extraordinary but coupled with the story behind them, I thought it was really powerful.  I especially liked the Savage State and the Descruction State.

The first painting which depicted The Savage State where everything is just overall dark and carries almost a feeling of death with all of the sinister colors and clouds.  When I look at this painting I immediately think of the various battles in Cooper's novel.  It really does focus on the savagery that is associated with these people.  In the far left corner you see what appears to be a sunset, a sneak peak of clear skies and what could be called as the greener grass on the other side.  I took this as the civilization that the indians were soon to be overtaken with.  It was almost as if it was a warning for them as well as for the person viewing the painting of what was to come in the near future.

The Destruction State in particular was my favorite.  In the intro to this presentation it says that there is a symbol here to the ""higher force of God"" which I find apparent in this painting although how I come to realizing it might not be what was originally intended.  The sky in this painting is the element that stands out the most.  What I got from this was sort of a Moses parts the red sea sort of thing, only with the clouds as opposed to the water.  The clouds also might stand for the indians as a race.  As the clouds are being driven from the sky during this stage, so are the indians being driven from their lands.  The intro is also very true naming this the ""apocolyptic fall"".  Seeing this painting makes me think this would be similar to what we would witness if ever there was the end of the world. The third definition in the Mirriam-Webster dictionary for apocalyptic reads ""foreboding imminent disaster or final doom"".  This painting does just that."

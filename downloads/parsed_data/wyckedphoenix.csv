I registered for my classes last week.. My schedule is insane! I have 16.5 units... I'm there all day on Monday and Wednesday's and 1 class on Tuesday and Thursdays. My classes are B&W Photography ( need the darkroom time to work on portfolio), History of Women in Rock Music, Art Appreciation and Color Pohoto.. that my M&W's.. T&TH I have Design and Color.. so ,like I said.. insane.

Today is finally the day that Andy has waited years for. HIS GUITAR IS COMING TODAY!!! He got a call from UPS and it is deffinatly on the way. Good thing we didn't have plans tonight, he's not going to want to put it down, LoL.

I can't wait till Friday!! I'm the biggest geek in the world. If it wasn't bad enough that I went to the midnight release of the new Harry Potter movie, I am going to be at the midnight release party for the new book on Friday! YEAH! So I'm a geek, so what.. there are millions of us. I am dying to read the new book though. I'm hoping to have it finished in a week so Andy then his mom can read it.. haha."

"event","I just feel like babling.. 

So, I'm kinda excited cause I have some paid work comming my way. I have two weddings lined up, a sweet sixteen photoshoot, two concerts and possibly a quincinera.. Not all in June though. It's all spread out between now and September, then one next year. I'm just excited to have things to do!

So, it took Andy two and a half days to read the new Anita book! So I started it last night! I like it way better than the last one already, it's more like an Anita book. I won't say to much though incase Summer reads this journal.. I don't want to ruin it for her, LoL.

Other than that... things are pretty much the same.. 

Oh yeah, I get to go to Vegas in July too! Andy's cousin is getting married but we were not going to go cause it's on a Friday and Andy could not get the day off.. Well, I found out that Andy's dad didn't want to go either so his mom was going to go alone.. she made a joke about kidnapping me but I said I would go if she wanted company. So I'm going to go with her! It should be fun.

Okay.. I think that's about it.."

"event","I had a really long period of not having any inspiration when it came to taking photos.. so I didn't do anything. Now.. I am finally excited about picking up my camera again. I started by taking shots in my photo class last night, I got a really good one of DJ that I had pictured in my head all day..

Speaking of DJ.. I absolutly love his work and am really excited cause he has agree to photo me. It's going to be him, Pati and possibly Kilolo doing shots for me! I need to get new images of myself to use and I hate all the ones that I take.. Hopefully we can get something good out.

I'm also going to be doing a shoot with DJ and a model friend of his next week. I'm really excited cause it gives me good practice. I want to do more work with people, and I can only take so many shots of Andy.. LOL

So, things are looking up."

"event","Okay, not really.. but it sounded good..
Here it is, 12:19am... and I sit here awake. I really should be sleeping or at least finishing my math homework so I know what to do for the test tomorrow.. but I'm not.
My lower back is absolutly KILLING me and I didn't even do anything.. It suck cause it is one of those things that, you never really know how often you move a certain part of your body till it hurts. Yeah, it's like that..

I have so many things on my mind.. it's lke spinning in circles and all you see are colorful blurs. I guess I'll just start.

My photography teacher is in the hospital. I have been told he is doing okay and not to tell anyone cause he doesn't want people to make a big deal (okay Rab).. but I am still worried. Most people that are in that class are like family, I hope he gets better soon.

I feel the need to say... people are stupid sometimes. I got nosey and wanted to know how many other people have commented on a certain blog that I posted about before.. well, the newest comment is kinda stupid to me.. it said how the person knew from experience how hard it was to raise a child under finacial stress but not to let what other people say get to the other person.. it then says, perhaps your friends are just worried cause you are in a financial situation where it is hard to feed yourself let alone a child, but don't listen to anyone who has never raised a child!
That is the exact thing WE all said and none of us have raised kids! That's a retarded comment. We didn't have to have kids to know that this is going to be really herd for them.. *BLAH!*

I can't take it anymore.. I can't get away from the drama cause I worry about my friends but at the same time it is driving me nuts.. I went looking for it!! I need to get away. This weekend with just Andy might be nice for me.. I'm not saying I don't love my friends but I need to be alone with my husband. I need to stop worrying about things that have no impact on me.. I need to clear my mind of all the crap that has nothing to do with me.. I need a break."

"event","Only a few friends know I have this and will read it and I don't care if they do.. I trust them..

I'm done trying.. I'm tired of being the good friend that people turn to, talk to cause they know they can... and then I get shit on. Why ask for my honest opinion and then make me look like an evil person cause I gave you an opinion that you don't like? I guess I should just lie to make you feel better, say what you really want to hear not what I really believe..

Anyone who read this would know who I am talking about.. and I am about to get mean... I don't do that often.

Why do people think that TRUE friends are not going to tell the truth? Why am I not going to say ""You made a mistake"" when that is how I feel.. I understand wanting to take your relationship further.. fine, protect yourself. Condoms bug you? Guess what, they bug me too. But I still use them!!

Okay.. I'm done.. this journal can come back to bite me in the ass and I am not sure if I care or not right now.. I'll will say this though.. the next time someone askes me for my opinion I am damn sure going to ask right back.. ""Do you want my opinion or yours?"""

You are bright, bold, energetic, and intense.
Your upbeat, zany energy inspires those who are down.
Spontaneous and playful, you also have a courageous and fearless side.

When you are too red: you are angry, overprotective, and truly scary.

When you don't have enough red: you are depleted and lifeless.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatcolorisyourpsychequiz/"">What Color Is Your Psyche?</a></div>"

""after the love was gone, how could you lead me on, and not let me stay around?

ooooh ooooh oh.

after the love was gone, what used to be right is wrong. Can love that's lost be found?"""

"event","okay... I was mostly kidding about seeing the Passion Of The Christ in my last entry...  but sweet jesus...... (no pun intended)

to quote Roger Ebert ""The movie is 126 minutes long, and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus. This is the most violent film I have ever seen.""

hmm... my interest has been sparked ;-)

"event","Oh yeah... and if anyone is interested in seeing ""The Passion of the Christ"", let me know. im down for 2 hours of jesus torturing any day :-)

""The story of the film basically follows the last hours of Christ, from his betrayal by Judas to his condemnation by a reluctant Pontius Pilate. As such, the bulk of the film focuses on the passion (literal translation being ""suffering"") that Christ is succumbed to during his final day on this mortal coil. Said passion included violent and extended scenes of torture and a long, laborious and bloody crawl through Jerusalem up to the craggy mountaintop where he was crucified.""

""let's face it, the film is roughly 120 minutes that focuses on the torture and humiliation of Jesus Christ, first at the hands of his disciples, then at the hands of the people of Galilee, and finally at the hands of the Roman soldiers. Even folks with a high tolerance for gore will find this film unsettling as Jim Caviezel/Jesus Christ endures beating after beating in a relentless display of masochism""

"event","probably my favorite poem of all time... and it has more meaning for me now then ever before. 

weighing the dog

It is awkward for me and bewildering for him
as I hold him in my arms in the small bathroom,
balancing our weight on the shaky blue scale,

but this is the way to weigh a dog and easier
than training him to sit obediently on one spot
with his tongue out, waiting for a cookie.

With pencil and paper I subtract my weight
from our total to find out the remainder that is his,
and I start to wonder if there is an analogy here.

It could not have to do with my leaving you
though I never figured out what you amounted to
until I subtracted myself from our combination.

You held me in your arms more than I held you
through all those awkward and bewildering months
and now we are both lost in strange and distant neighborhoods.

The big bang... the universe expands from an infinitesimally small singularity and superheated matter is tossed to the far corners. Atoms combine and mutate in the heat forming elements. elements group together in clouds which begin swirling and swirling spinning into tight super dense hot balls that explode into stars and send heavier elements out which crash together and become planets. in our solar system the third planet from the sun is a ball of molten iron. less dense elements rise to the surface of the planet where they cool harden, and then sink back down into the planet. hundreds of millions of years pass, the planet cools down. a radioactive element on the planet is at just the right temperature to create  a small strand of protein that mutates into a single celled organism that develops photosynthesis to survive. as a part of photosynthesis the organism absorbs carbon and produces oxygen. hundreds of millions of years pass. the planet has cooled, oxygen and nitrogen released from the planet have formed an atmosphere. there is rain. the rain collects in large pools. lighting strikes these pools and creates new protein. hundreds of millions of years pass, trilobites, hundreds of millions of years pass, fish, hundreds of millions of years pass, creatures take to land, millions of years pass, the planet experiences a boom of life. millions and millions and millions of years pass, dinosaurs come and go, millions of years pass, man sets foot on the planet, with his brain developed as the ultimate tool for survival. man names the planet earth. man does not understand earth so man creates god. men create war. men create beauty. men create philosophy and truly begin to think. men create science. science slowly reveals to men the way the world works. men become afraid when they realize that there is no god. men begin to discover that existence is pointless. science shows men that the universe will eventually collapse upon itself. men realize there is no such thing as free will because there is only one future, non existence. science reveals there is no such thing as free thought because all thoughts are chemical reactions in the brain that are part of a chain reaction that started with the big bang. All thought, every thought every man has ever had was meant to happen and had to happen. why? because of chaos. because of a random series of events. a random series of events that all men are trapped in. men call these random events ""lives"". god promises men an afterlife. god lies. god is a lie.there is no afterlife. there is only nothing-chaos-then nothing. and because everything will end, because everything will cease to exist, men accepted the fact that life is pointless, and that everything they do was simply contributing to the chaos and there was no way to escape it because everything that has happened and everything that will happen is chaos. philosophers gave up the pursuit for truth when they realized truth is chaos. they reasoned... ""EVERYTHING IS CHAOS AND EVERYTHING IS FUCKED UP AND EVERYONE IS FUCKED UP AND EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"". 
                     then man created love. and love worked for a while.
 
the end.

I need change. 

something drastic...


The Art Of Drowning

I wonder how it all got started, this business
about seeing your life flash before your eyes
while you drown, as if panic, or the act of submergence,
could startle time into such compression, crushing
decades in the vice of your desperate, final seconds.

After falling off a steamship or being swept away
in a rush of floodwaters, wouldn't you hope
for a more leisurely review, an invisible hand
turning the pages of an album of photographs-
you up on a pony or blowing out candles in a conic hat.

How about a short animated film, a slide presentation?
Your life expressed in an essay, or in one model photograph?
Wouldn't any form be better than this sudden flash?
Your whole existence going off in your face
in an eyebrow-singeing explosion of biography-
nothing like the three large volumes you envisioned.

Survivors would have us believe in a brilliance
here, some bolt of truth forking across the water,
an ultimate Light before all the lights go out,
dawning on you with all its megalithic tonnage.
But if something does flash before your eyes
as you go under, it will probably be a fish,

a quick blur of curved silver darting away,
having nothing to do with your life or your death.
The tide will take you, or the lake will accept it all
as you sink toward the weedy disarray of the bottom,
leaving behind what you have already forgotten,
the surface, now overrun with the high travel of clouds.

                                          -Billy Collins

Random Bible Quote: Issac begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his brothers. Judah begat Perez and Zerah. Perez begat Hezrong. Hezrong begat Ram. Ram begat Amminadab. Amminadab begat Nashon....

Matthew 1, 3-5

I wish my name was Hezrong... :-P

The Second Coming

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight:  somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
                         -W.B. Yeats
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone else feel like things are falling apart?

Epitaph On A Pessimist

I'm Smith of Stoke aged sixty odd
I've lived without a dame all my life
And wish to God
My dad had done the same.

-Thomas Hardy

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the record! my epitaph should read : Pepperoni and cheese. 

and lie in my obituary. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was very tense walking into my interview today. But the guy was friendly, and the nerves passed as we began talking. With in a few minutes things were very buddy-buddy! We connected with every issue he brought up, and the times I listed were PERFECT. Soon after we got through laughing over a particularly funny episode of ""Family Guy"" I had recalled, he leaned in and told me I was the front runner for the position. Then we hugged. After the interview we stepped out for a late lunch together. We were working on some of his bio homework, at Carls Junior, over a big greasy burger, when we accidently stumbled across the cure for cancer. Right after we got back from fighting crimes in NYC with our superpowers we agreed to be best friends forever. 

""never underestimate the power of denial""

Yeah... the interview was terrible. You should have applied Anna!

Today a really hot guy kept looking over at me in my Ethics discussion. I swear over a period of ten minutes we must have made eye contact at least thirty times. He has a soft roman face, short brown hair, full magenta lips, and well tailored sideburns. At first I wasn't sure if I had met the guy before... so I politely smiled, and he smiled back. At that point I knew I hadn't met him before, because I would have remembered such a beautiful smile. tragically, I'll have to wait another week before I can see the guy again. I'll definitely sit closer :-D 

Person of the moment: Tha Cousin', Who somehow managed to master Castlevania within moments of picking up the game. Video games must be in our blood ;-) 

Obscure Fact: Today I walked into a door infront of a large crowd of people. 

I'll leave you with a lovely little poem entitled ""The Popes Penis""

It hangs deep in his robes, a delicate
clapper at the center of a bell.
It moves when he moves, a ghostly fish in a
halo of silver sweaweed, the hair
swaying in the dark and the heat -- and at night
while his eyes sleep, it stands up
in praise of God.

When You Are Old
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
-William Butler Yeats

I'm SOOOOO over it. 



Good food and hot scenesters always make for a good night. Thanks Ruth!!"

"event","So it has been over 5 years since I have posted in this thing. I feel like I am different person from 5 years ago and Im not sure how I feel about it. Alot has happened and I feel like I dont have anyone to talk to about these things, I dont feel like anyone would truly understand my feelings, thats why I have to write this. Things have been crazy lately and its still hard to comprehend what has happened. I have never felt more betrayed or hurt in my entire life. No one has ever hurt me this way and Im not sure how to deal with it. Somedays I dont even want to get out of bed, I dont want to remember anything or think about it, yet its ALL I think about, every day.....hoping it was a mistake, wishing it was a dream. I just feel numb...numb to happiness, numb to the life going on around me. I thought I had this part of my life figured out, I was happy knowing that I knew who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but it just goes to show that nothing is promised, definatly not love. I know I have bitched and griped about love throughout this journal, but I can honestly say that this time its different. This time it goes deeper, to a place that has never been touched before. I dont hate him, I just hate what he did to me. He destroyed me. How can I ever let anyone get close again? How am I ever supposed to be the same? How do I move on? I just have so much anger towards him, im just SO angry. It has only been about 2 months, but I am SICK of feeling this way, SICK of thinking about him, SICK of crying, SICK of remembering what we had, SICK of thinking about him in some way everytime someone mentions something that reminds me of him, SICK of feeling numb. How could he do this to me? How do you do this to someone you ""apparently"" loved? Everyone tells me that everything happens for a reason...what the hell was the reason? I would like to know. He couldnt even talk to me about it face to face. After 2 years all I get is one freaking phone call and thats it, I never hear from him again. I feel like a fool. I should have known this would happen, I should have known he would do this. Do I not deserve a real explanation? Do I not deserve that? Instead I get a bunch of BS about how he needs to be on his own. Well, i gave you exactly what you wanted, I just hope you can live with yourself. I could never do this to someone I loved, NEVER. So maybe he never really loved me, ill probably never know. Dont you men understand that us women just want to be let down easy in an appropriate way with a reasonable explanation? We need an explanation! I just hope you get everything you want in life, I really do. Im sorry that I wanted something good for my life and future and Im sorry I was working hard to make that a reality, but you didnt have to use that against me and make me feel guilty. You didnt have to take that happiness from me. You obviously have commitment issues, but I dont want to be alone for the rest of my life like you. Dont turn your issues into my issues, and you know deep down that you screwed up and that you got scared and couldnt commit. I honestly feel that for once in my life I did nothing to deserve this. I loved you with all of my heart and thats why this hurts so much. Just know, I will never be the same because of this."

"event","wow, it has been forever since I have written in this thing. So, I have a bf now, his name is Cole. We have been going out for about a month and a half, and I guess things are going ok. He says that he loves me, but for some reason I still doubt him, I dont know why, but thats just what I do. We got in one big fight and ever since then I just feel like things have changed between us, I cant really put my finger on it, but he just seems more distant. I want us to be ok, but it just seems like something inside of me has burned out when it comes to him. I do love him and want to be with him, but at the same time I keep doubting that this is going to work. I dont know, i guess we will see that happens."

Watching someone else walk away with your dog knowing that you will never see it alive again. It had cancer, but that doesnt stop the feeling that I had that I was killing him. I felt so guilty, i felt like a murderer. I just kept picturing his face, so pure so innocent....just staring back at me with those eyes. I cried the entire day. Do you think that wherever he is he forgives me?"

"event","So Joey left today to go back to New York, and im not quite sure how I feel. I think that more then anything my feelings were hurt. But i guess in the end I kind of expected it. Its kind of like I knew it all along, but its kind of like i didnt want to believe it or I just shrugged it off. Maybe in the end we were both with eachother for the same reason...it was convienient, but I think that I just put a little more heart into it. But thats the thing with me, i tend to put my heart into most everything that I do. I just put it out thereI guess I just wanted to believe that it was true and that he really did like me. All I know is that you cant go through life thinking that your some hot shot and use people, cause one day I promise that your going to wake up and life is going to surprise you. Its just one of those things that is inevitable. And maybe you will get past that moment, but life will always seem a little less ""grand"" to you. But then again life always has a way of making things seem a little less grand."

"event","so my date went pretty well, we just went to dinner and then came back to my house and watched batman begins and then he had to leave at like 10 cause he had to work early in the morning. But he said he had a good time and that i was a ""nice sweet girl"". lol. I am hanging out with him again tonight, him and some of his friends and i think my sis are going to go down to to 4th ave. or university, im not sure yet, but its funny cause hes not 21 yet but he has a fake ID, hopefully it will work for him tonight. I like him though, hes really nice and he opens doors for me! lol, its been awhile since a guy has opened a door for me. So im really looking forward for tonight, i hope its fun. Elisa sent me a message on myspace saying that she was sorry about how things ended so shitty between us and that she would like it if we could hang out or go to dinner sometime. I told her that i guess we could, although i dont know if that was the best idea. i just dont want things to go back to the way that they were between us, i dont know if i really want to be friends again, but i guess we will see what happens. Well, off to go get ready for tonight!"

"event","so ive pretty much come to the conclusion that everybody has somebody but me. I just dont understand why everybody gets to meet this person that they fall in love with and that they cant get enough of, but here i am, a jerk magnet getting trampled on. Its not that ive totally given up on love, but its just so hard to stay positive when all you ever get is dissapointment.......im just so tired of being dissapointed, im tired of feeling like im never good enough and that i want to be somebody else with a different personality or a different face, because i think if I could be anyone but me I would not be treated the way that I am and I wouldn't have some huge stamp that says ""pushover"" on my forehead. Its just that so many people have dissapointed me lately and I cant help but wonder why. I know that human nature has something to do with it, but that cant be everything. I want to like who I am but when everybody around you constantly lets you down and the people that you care about walk alover you, you really begin to notice your flaws and compare yourself to other people, thinking if you could just be like them life would be bliss. I know that is an illusion, perfection really does not exist, but if perfection does not exist how are you supposed to find the person who is perfect for you and who thinks you are perfect for them? It just doesnt help when your old friends from highschool come over with their new husband and they cant stop touching eachother or smiling and you have nothing to show for yourself because your not seeing anyone. It just makes you feel a little more insignificant. And you think how did they do it? How did they meet them? What did they do? It cant just be luck, i refuse to believe that, it has to be something more. I find myself constantly looking for that, something I could have done differently or something I should do, but then i find myslef saying I just need to be me because there has to be someone out there who will love a shy girl who constantly doubts who she is and what she does because she has scars. And maybe shes not the smartest or prettiest girl in the world, but someone can still love and respect her right? That cant be asking too much. So i went to my dad's work BBQ and met this guy....he just started talking to me and hes so nice and hes cute, but of course there has to be some sort of catch...hes only here for the summer as a summer intern from cornell. Just my luck right? So we ended up talking the entire night and before he leaves he asks for my number, saying we could hang out again this summer. The BBQ was on saturday and now its monday and i cant stop thinking about him and i dont know why. He hasnt called me yet so im constantly worried that he wont, but i mean maybe he just believes in that whole waiting 3 days before you call thing, I dont know. But the is what if he does call and we hang out and then I end up falling for him? Hes only here until the end of the summer and then he goes back to new york? What am i supposed to do then? I really dont need someone else to miss....and I dont want to miss someone who lives on the other side of the united states cause im pretty damn sure i will end up never seeing them again. So then I tell myself, we'll just hang out and have fun and that will be it, we will just be friends. But i cant tell myself how im going to feel later on down the road, so i feel stuck. But i guess i just need to stop worrying and wait for him to call me first. Heres to more worrying until he does...."

"event","so i lost it the other night.....just completely lost it. I went to my ex bf's house because i had to give him something and i just sat down in the middle of his floor and started crying uncontrollably. Its just like the weight of the world and the weight of my life became too much. It was just the weight of people not caring.....not giving a shit about how they treat me or how i feel about anything. When someone says to you,""you are so pathetic you could make me sick"" you tend to wonder why you are even really alive. Its just that people depend on me, they depend on me to show them a little bit of light in their dark worlds and i always find myself trying to save them, but really im tired of it, i cant be that happy person all the time even though I do a good job walking around with a smile on my face. Who is going to save me? I just always find people to drag me down and i somehow become a part of their complicated lives. All the little things just added up and i just felt like i was drowning and everyone kept pushing my head under, not letting me come up. But at the same time i thought, maybe it is better down here, where i dont have to breathe the ruined air that is the world, that is our lives. I dont want to let myself slip down there, i dont want to drown. I dont want to be like them, i just want to be the person that is inside me, the person that people see in me that is good. I wont go down with them, i just wont."

Stephanie ended up getting trashed and started flipping out so elisa and i had to kick everyone out of the house. She basically got alcohol poisoning so elisa and i had to stay with her and take care of her. It was kinda scary though cause she was acting like she was having seizures. I have never seen someone act like that or be that drunk.  Brad was supposed to come over to stephanies to see elisa and then i was going to leave, but elisa and i fell asleep on the couch at 4am so she missed brad's call, so i ended staying the night over there.  Stephanie was fine in the morning though. Well, im supposed to eat with steve today....who knows if that will work out ;c) I just really hope that things will work out for him cause i care so much about him and i hate to see him hurting.

I didnt think that you were supposed to feel this way when you supposedly love someone, but yet i still cant bring myself to say those words...but there is just this emptiness....and i dont know why i feel this way, i mean, im not supposed to,am i? For some reason its just so hard for me to say it....maybe because everytime that i have they end up leaving me. I want to be with him so bad, yet i still dont believe that he loves me and that he really wants me, and i dont know why i cant bring myself to believe him or myself about how i feel about him. I keep trying to convince myself that this is not love, but then i ask myself why do i cry over someone that i dont love? Why did i almost lose it when i thought i lost him that one day? Why is he always in my thoughts and dreams? Why is that when he kisses me i melt inside? Why do i feel an aching pain when im not with him or when i know i wont get to see him or talk to him? I keep wanting this to be love.....but maybe it already is, but for some reason i keep telling myself its not. Im just a mix of emotions, especially after last night. I couldnt help but feel that i was just another girl to him and that this was just another night in his life. I went home not knowing who i was to him and i hate that feeling. Im just going to let time solve this one and hope that i can bring myself to feel whatever it is im supposed to. I know things will work out the way they are supposed to, this i leave to fate."

"event","blah, so ok today before i went to class at 5 kenneth imed me and we were talking and he told me that hes coming back to tucson for a few months from vegas so he wants to hang out. He said he might even be here as early as thursday. I havent seen him in forever, so i need to think of something for me and him to do...maybe ill take him to famous daves, lol, some more free food from mike!  I also found out some interesting stuff from him....im not quite sure how i feel about it....first of all because i had no idea how he felt, but its ok cause me and him are friends and we can still hang out. I have also really been feeling like shit about this whole thing that happend last weekend with brian and corey....i still think about it all the time, i cant get it out of my head. I guess i thought that they just had a little more respect for elisa and I then that, but i guess they dont. I know i just need to let it go, but for some reason i cant....its like burning up inside of me and i just want to punch one of them in the face, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i hate them. And need i mention i am so fucking sick of school!!?? I cant wait until its over!!! Oh and i found out that aaron lives like right down the street from me, i havent seen him in forever and we need to hang out.  Chris called me sunday night and asked me to go to a movie with him, aaron, and this girl maggie, i wanted to go but i had hw to do, boo. But i told him i would go another time. Well, off to bed i go."

Everytime I talk to you,
Everytime I see you,
Everytime you hug me,
I get really happy.
When I think about it,
I get really sad because
I dont see you everyday.

I dont know what it is but 
I think im starting to love you
More and more everytime
I talk to you on the phone,
When I see you once in a while,
And when I do get a hug.

Its frustrating for me 
Because im afraid youll 
Probably never be with me
And if your not, I just want
You to know, I will still love you

"event","I dont know what im going to do. How am i supposed to be with someone that i cant really be with? Its like im a little kid and ive been given a toy and i can see it and touch it and feel it, but i can only have it for a certain amount of time each day, and i can only play with it at the toy store, cant take it home with me, i have to leave it there, i cant have it whenever i want it.  And no matter how bad I want it it will never be truly mine. Do you know how hard that is? To have someone right in front of you but not be able to be with them because the world won't let you? The only reason i look forward to going to school is to see him, but thats the only place i can see him, its the only place im allowed to see him.  Sometimes life is just so unfair. Sometimes I just want to hate him, i want to hate him for even getting involved with me when he knew his situation, but deep down inside I cant hate him, i cant hate him for something that happened to him. And sometimes i want to hate him because he is so much like my ex, and that kinda scares me.  But the only thing that i am truly scared of is what i might do.

Close your eyes and I'll hold you here 
It's all right if you're feelin' scared 
It's just the sound of your aching heart 
You've hurt for so long inside the dark 
Now you can cry for the world out there 
Come inside and I'll kiss your tears 
It's still the sound tearing you apart 
Loving out loud with only half a heart 

I'll stay with you 
I'll stay with you 
I won't leave you alone 
I'll stay with you yes I want to 

Make your pain my own 
And if you need me all night or until I grow old 
No you don't have to ask me to 
I'm gonna take good care of you 
Yes I'm gonna stay with you 
I'll be right at your fingertips 
Hold on tight and we'll get through this 
Angels are calling from all around 
Lifting what's broken comforting what is bound 
Now you can rest in your time of need 
I am here when it's hard to breathe 
If you can't remember what is good anymore 
I will surrender and kick down heaven's door"

"event","A little boy asked his mother, ""Why are you crying?""
""Because I'm a woman, "" she told him.

""I don't understand, "" he said.

His Mom just hugged him and said, ""And you never will.""

Later the little boy asked his father, ""Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?""
""All women cry for no reason, "" was all his dad could say.

The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.

Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, ""God, why do women cry so easily?""

God said ""When I made the woman she had to be special.I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet gentle enough to give comfort.

I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.

I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect her heart.

I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly. And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed.""

""You see my son, "" said God, ""the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides."

"event","so steve and i have been seeing quite alot of eachother, mostly at school, but i went into his work a few times and ate with him.  I surprised him once and he couldn't stop smiling, it made me feel so good to be able to make someone smile like that.  He told me that he doenst want anyone but me and he would wait for me, however long that takes.  The thing is hes 26, so hes done playing games in relationships, which is a good thing, but hes also alot older then me, so i dont know if im really ready to bukle down in a serious relationship and get rid of me ""singleness"" for good.  Im just so used to being single i dont even know if i remember how to be in a relationship or how to be a girlfriend for that matter.  I want to be in a relationship and then i don't because im not even 21 yet, and i still think i have alot of life to live, and i dont know if he will put up with me after im 21 cause i want to go out and have fun just like everyone else, so i dont want to hurt him in that respect, but i believe that if we are meant to be togehter then we will be togehter.  He is dealing with alot right now....alot of things happened to him in his past that he is still dealing with and they are things that i have to accept and in someways become a part of.  I dont know if i can deal with these things or not,  because its kind of asking alot of me, but i keep thinking that i have to give him a fair chance because there are things that happen to us in our lives that we cannot control, but we have to live with them and we want people to see the best in us and give us a fair chance based on who we are, not on what happened in the past.  I just know that if i was him i would want people to give me a fair chance, not be afraid of what they might have to accept or deal with.  I want to be there for him in every way that i can, especially since the death of his mother, who i found out is buried by my grandma, its a small world after all.  I believe i met him for a reason, and he seems to have it all figured out why he met me, but im just so afriad to fall in love again, im so afriad of being hurt again.  I know i cant let this fear stop me from feeling, but i dont know if i want to fall in love again.  I dont know if we will love eachother, but it could happen.  Well, who knows if things will work out or not, but im not giving up on this one quite yet and im definatly following my heart."

Tomorrow is Elisa's b-day so me and some peeps are going out to dinner and then probably to some parties, probably hang out with dave or corey, maybe andy too cause he said he was having a party. Had a work meeting tonight...boring, but fun talking with everyone. Justin came drunk which was hilarious and ended up getting my number cause some people from work were gonna go out and drink so he was gonna call me, but they ended up going to Chuy's and drinking so i didnt go.  Kamron and Dave wanted to hang out too, but i was too tired, but i will def see Dave tomorrow.  Went to a Frat party last weekend, it was alright, but it was great cause this guy got us 2 bottles of champagne, so good. So me and Ricci are totally done with our little thing....whatever it was...but it was so wrong so its over. So today at school this guy steve in my human sexuality class asked for my number cause we ended up talking after class for about half an hour, and he seems nice, so who knows where this is going to go...guess ill find out sooner or later. Well, tomorrow should be fun as long as it doesnt end in any real drama.

Elisa's friend Emily from Connecticut was here this past week, the one that i met when i was in CT in december and who i went to NYC with. We got along fine this time and shes a cool person, shes going to school in Boston and wants Elisa and i to come see her during spring break or something. We mostly just hung out at Corey and Brian's house and drank, it was alright. So me and Ricci are pretty much over, even though i was never his gf i told him we should just be friends cause i know for a fact that it would never work out for us cause i know whats best for me. He got pretty upset with me and said some really mean things, but then he called me up and apologized later, but whatever, it doesnt really phase me, i just need to find someone my own age. Kamron was promoted to assistant manager at work now, so its kinda weird, but i think he deserved the position. He hasnt really been talking to me much, but he called me last night and we talked for over an hour about things and he just told me that hes still trying to get over me and he is going through some other difficult things right now. I think we might hang out tonight and go see the movie Red Eye or something, i dont know. The University of Arizona started today, but since im not going there anymore, i dont start at Pima until wednesday. Im kinda sad that im not going to the U of A anymore, but i might be going there for pharmacy school if i get in. But today is Elisa's first day of college so im excited for her, even though her and Corey just broke up yesterday, so shes going through a tough time. Apparently mike's roomate matt likes me which is kinda weird cause ive always been over at their house and he doesnt act like it but taya told me he always asks about me. He was having people over to drink the other night and so i went, i always have a blast when i go over there and he is just freaking hilarious when hes drunk. So my sister hasnt been feeling all that well lately so she went back to the doctor and had to get a scope done where they stick that tube down your throat and look around, but she just got it done today so they dont have the results yet. My mom just got back from New York City cause my dad had to go there for a business trip so he got an extra ticket for my mom to go. It must be nice there during the summer, all i know is that i froze my ass off when i was there. My mom got back last night but  my dad isnt coming back until next week.  I think my tattoo is pretty much almost healed, yay, but i think i am going to get it refilled in. Well, today is cleaning day so i got to get back to it. And oh, i forgot to say this earlier, but happy 21st b-day matt, hope you got my card...."

It was alot of fun and i am officially in love with it there and want to move there soooo bad! i stayed in elisa's grandma's condo in La Jolla, it was really nice. We went to the beach everyday, it was perfect weather, its too bad i had to come back to this shit hole. I spent way too much money while i was there though.....and yea.....i kinda did something while i was there with elisa....i got a TATTOO!!!!!!!! Its cute, its a heart that says ""true love"" around it, i like it, it kinda hurt though, so im pretty sure i wont be getting another one. I dont know whether or not im going to tell my parents....still thinking about that one. But i called my mom on thursday while i was there but she wasnt home, but she called me back on saturday and told me that my dad was in the hospital.  I guess he got really sick when my parents were coming back from our cabin in the mountains so they had to stop at the ranger station and call an ambulance. He got a CAT scan today and one of his intestines is inflamed, his colon i guess. Anyways, it looks like he is going to be ok and will probably get out of the hospital tomorrow. AHHH, it was a good week and i dont want to go back to work and then school starts the 24th i think, not looking forward to that. Well, gonna go get something to eat and then its time to unpack!!"

I am really looking forward to it, it should be fun, one last trip before school starts, its hard to believe that the summer is almost over. I really dont want to go back to school. Not alot has been going on...just pretty much working everyday. Ricci and i are getting alot closer and im not too sure how i feel about that yet. We have been talking alot, almost every night. Im attracted to him and i do like him and hes made it very clear that he likes me and wants to be with me, but the whole age thing is still really getting to me and holding me back. I know that no one would ever accept us, and i hate that, but i mean, i can see why, it doenst exactly seem natural for a 37 year old guy to go for a 20 year old girl....but thats really not the point....what if they both like eachother? What should they do? I have never been in this situation before....but i want to follow my heart...even though im not exactly sure what its telling me right now, but my head is still telling me its wrong to get involved with him. Oh well, i think i am going to hang out with him tonight after dinner with my family. I just cant wait to get to the ocean....i miss it.  Went to dinner with taya and mike and his roommate at on the border a few nights ago, it was fun, then went back to mikes house and watched his roommates music videos that he made, they were so hilarious! Then we went to pets mart and bought some fish for mikes pond that he just put in in his backyard. i feel bad for my sis cause since mike has become one of the managers where she works she has to quit because they wont let her work for his cause she is his gf, so now shes out of a job. Believe me, i know how unfair that shit is. Well, gonna go find something to do until dinner."

Saturday i went to a b-day party for this guy Alex's kid, brian and corey and elisa were there and elisa and i danced with eachother...so much fun. I think we might go to coconuts this thursday. Then after the party brian, corey, elisa and i went swiming at the pool where i live...that was interesting...lol. Brian and i had an ineresting conversation where he basically told me that i lead guys on, including him...i seriousoly dont know what i do to get these guys to like me cause when i was out with my dad on saturday this guy ricci, this guy that i work with, calls me up cause he got my number from work and i guess he likes me which would be all fine and dandy if he wasnt 37 YEARS OLD...like he could be my father! I REALLY dont know what i do to get these guys to like me. He wants to go out and stuff but im just like hi...your 17 years older then me! I dont know whats going on anymore, and it doesnt  help when i have to work with him everyday. Then kamron told me that this guy chris that i work with thinks i like him and this other guy john i work with thinks i like him too. WHAT IN THE HELL IS HAPPENING!!!??? maybe i just need to quit talking to guys period. Sunday night elisa and i went to Andy's b-day party cause rey called me up and invited us, but that turned into a HUGE disaster so we ended up leaving after like 10 minutes and went to corey's for awhile. Today i worked from 11-3. Then Drew from my work calls me up and asks if ill work a double for him tomorrow cause its his b-day. And i have this problem saying no, but i dont really have anything else to do, so of course i say yes. So then he tells me that he really owes me and that he will hook me up with all the alcohol i want at his party tomorrow night cause he invited people from work, so thats kinda cool i guess, but tomorrow i get to work from 11-8, its gonna be fun times. Oh and im going to california from august 1-9th, La Jolla to be exact cause elisa'a grandma has a condo there almost right on the beach, its gonna be fun. Ew, school starts August and im not looking forward to it.  I have to take 12 credits even though i dont need that much cause otherwise i wont have insurance and then when i have to have surgery ill have to pay a shit load that i wont be able to afford, so that sucks. i cant believe the summer is almost over.

Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we,ve found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come.
   When I look at you, I see your beauty and grace and know they have grown stronger with every life you have lived. And I know I have spent every life before this one searching for you.

   I would love to tell you that everything will work out for us, and I promise to do all I can to make sure it does. But if we never meet again and this is truly goodbye, I know we will see each other again in another life. We will find eachother again, and maybe the stars will have changed, and we will not only love each other in that time, but for all the times we've had before."""

"event","So hard to know the reasons
It's hard to know the truth
When it's all over
Every time I look back
I just get more confused
So I replay every kiss and
Every clue I might have missed

Didn't I make you happy?
Didn't I get inside your heart?
Didn't I make you love me?
Didn't I, didn't I now baby
I turn my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
But I still lost you
Didn't I didn't I 

Why do I keep believing? 
What am I hoping for?
Why can't I let you go?
I did all I could do 
Why do I think there's something more?
I just don't understand
How love slipped right through our hands

Didn't I make you happy?
Didn't I get inside your heart?
Didn't I make you love me?
Didn't I, didn't I now baby
I turn my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
But I still lost you
Didn't I 

Why do I think the fault is mine?
Was it me at the wrong time?
Maybe I could move on 
If I knew the reason why

I turned my world upside down
I turned myself inside out
And I still lost you 
Didn't I, didn't I"

"event","What's the way of love? 
Tell me your fiction 
Tell me your lies 
Say to me now, you'll never forget this night 
I'm feeling emotionless 
My head's so clear 
My enemies aren't, the ones I fear 
You know your kiss confuses 
This troubling soul 
And I found out 
That we're all breaking hearts 
That we're all broken hearts 

If only love could find us all
If only hearts didn't have to fall 
We can't mislead to make things right 
So instead we'll sleep alone tonight 

What's the way of love? 
You are thinking I'm crazy 
But you're blushing of lust 
I've heard a lot of nice things, 
but tell me which ones I'm to trust? 
These walls we made are glass 
And they have been known to crack 
But until then 
You'll keep pushing my way 
And I'll keep pushing you away 

Well, if you want to take a chance 
And try to make things right 
You better have a reason to be loved 
We all want something more 
And it is worth fighting for... 

And if somehow fate were in my hands 
Would it be enough to understand 
Why we feel lost in a world so small 
If only love could find us all..."

Elisa and i got drunk one night with him and corey and all i can say is that brian started it. But corey warned me that he was just a big girl and that is exactly what he turned out to be. He got all pisses one night about something about me and started punching shit and then just stormed off without telling me anything after he just gets done telling me that he hates it when girls get mad at him and dont tell him why and then just leave cause all his ex gf's did it to him. Such a hypocrite. Fourth of july went to a BBQ at corey's house. I made cupcakes, they were really good and everybody liked them. Invited Kamron to go cause i felt bad cause he didnt have anything to do, but his presence just irritates the shit out of me, i dont really know why, maybe just cause i know how he feels about me and thats annoying. After the fireworks too elisa to get her spare key to her car cause she locked her keys in the car at my house. When i got back brian was at the BBQ and he wouldnt talk to me so finally i went up to him and we talked, but i think kamron might have heard cause he was sitting really close, but u know what? I DONT CARE!! So i guess me and brian are ok, but i dont think anything is going to happen between us, but thats ok cause hes too big of a girl for me. Matt, the one that works for my dad, call me from cali and kamron heard that too. The next day he starts lecturing me about how brian is just like every other guy and hes going to hurt me and that it hurts him to see me with other people and blah blah blah. I am so fucking sick of him! I just cant deal with him anymore!! AHHH!! I need to find a new job to get away from him. And then he told me at the BBQ that he wasnt going to school next semester so i got kind of mad cause that is just such a stupid decision, but i didnt say anything about it. Then this morning he told me was going to go to school because of me. i HATE when he does that shit, says that he does all this shit because of me. I dont know what to do about it cuase he will NEVER be together and he cant understand that! Other then that i have been doing a whole lot of nothing...just working and sitting on my ass. My parent are at our cabin for like a week and a half, for once no bitching or them just randomly showing up at my house. well, i have to go watch the real world."

"event","ok, so one of my friends wrote this in his away message. It kind of resurfaced some memories and things that i had been thinking about. Its funny how the moment i dont think about something it shows itself once again: ""So theres this giant morale dilemma I have going on in my head? Now regardless of a certain situation im still worried about only myself not the second party. Now please people answer me this. Is it better to wait for something far away that you really really want or is it better to take something really close just because its easy?"""

"event","ok, so it has been forever since i have updated. My sister is the only one that has internet in the house cause we are having problems setting up the wireless network in the house and my computer is once again being the biggest piece of shit, so i have to use her computer. Well lets see....not too much has been going on, pretty much just working. Oh yea, i took my P-CAT yesterday but i didn't finish the test cause i started feeling really sick so i had to get up and leave before the test was over. I was really pissed about that cause i at least wanted to finish the damn thing, but its not i studied for it anyways and im taking it again so it doesnt really matter. All i know is that i have alot of studying to do. So, yesterday was not the best day, but then i went to see Bewitched with kamron and elisa, it was cute, but we went at 11pm so we were all falling asleep. Today i have a work BBQ from 6-10 but elisa isnt going and kamron doenst get off work until 8:30 so it looks like i dont really have anyone to go with cause im not really friends with anyone else who works there, so it looks like im waiting for kamron to get off work, but i dont know. There is supposed to be live music and everything, so it sounds like it will be cool. Oh, and my dad decided to give my number to that guy matt who was at my dad's work BBQ, the one that my parents were trying to set me up with, so matt calls me and asks me on a date so we went cosmic bowling and then back to his house and watched anchorman. He kept looking at my all funny so i asked him what his looks were for and he told me that he really wanted to kiss me. I just kinda ignored the whole comment and didnt kiss him cause first of all i dont want to fuck things up cause it seems that everytime after i kiss a guy they get all weird on me. and second of all i just didnt feel like it cause i dont even know him. But we went out again and saw batman begins, it was good. Then he came back to my house and we were going to go in the hot tub but we watched tv instead. He kissed me goodnight but it was just one of those weird awkward kisses, and plus he asked for a kiss which i hate, i hate it when people ask for a kiss, just do it, dont ask. So im undecided about him, i dont really know how i feel about him, i mean hes nice and funny and everything, but something is still missing. Hes been calling me but i havent called him back yet...i know, im mean. Kamron found out we were ""dating"" and got all mad at me cause i didnt tell him. Whatever. I dont know, i guess im still waiting for prince charming to show up on my doorstep....if only that was case....."

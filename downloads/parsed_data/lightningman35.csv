This Welsh band is almost unknown here in the States, but are one the the biggest bands of all time in the UK and abroad.  This song rocks, and it (and everything else about this band, and especially frontman James Dean Bradfield), reminds me of my good friend angry_biscuit. . .I am thinking about him as I post this."

This is glam at its finest. . .without bands like this, there would have been no punk, no sex pistols, no clash. . .I have to admit, that I'm a fanatic for british music, and that my first punk bands emulated this by donning kilts. . .check out the getup of the guitar player with the top hat and the biker-spiked guitar strap. . .FANTASTIC. . ."

Some folks say there aint no bears in arkansas
Some folks never seen a bear at all
Some folks say that bears go around eating babies raw
Some folks got a bear across the hall

Some folks say that bears go around smelling bad
Others say that a bear is honey sweet
Some folks say this bears the best I ever had
Some folks got a bear beneath their feet

Some folks drive the bears out of the wilderness
Some to see a bear would pay a fee
Me I just bear up to bewildered best
And some folks even see the bear in me

So meet a bear and take him out to lunch with you
And even though your friends may stop and stare
Just remember thats a bear there in the bunch with you
And they just dont come no better than a bear"

Now this is incredible. . . insanely so.  What a bizarre, but interesting idea.  Nothing in my foreign policy courses prepared me for this. . ."

I will need a pretty good, if not perfect, cleaning--you know, just to keep it barefoot friendly for me and my kids.  Cleaning is just one thing that I won't be doing more of than I have to in my wild, natural, unmarried state. . . ."

Enjoy this most mystical of songs. . .It came on during my lift tonight, and flooded me with good feeling.  I've always been struck by the amazing guitar stylings of David Gilmour in this song, which remind me so much of Charlie Burchill of Simple Minds.  Maybe that's no accident, since John Giblin, formerly of Simple Minds, is the bass player. . .

I sang this loudly on my way out of work tonight, and it echoed just right in the empty halls. . ."

Between
""Will be"" and ""Was""
Waiting for things to change
But nothing ever does

The dust will mount forever.

Rain?  Unlikely.
Thunder, perhaps,
But not here,
Not precisely.

"event",". . .Just learned to hit the hockey puck (or whatever object is handy) correctly.

After months of insisting on using the wrong end of the stick, the stick inverted, etc., he just ""got"" it.  Now he is zinging dominoes, blocks, toys of all sorts, pens, markers and cups all over the place.  And for a two-and-a-half year old, he's got a pretty good idea of what using your wrist will do.  He is delighted seeing that things he shoots can go for 6- 12 feet easily.  He was frantically searching for his mini ""Capitals"" stick tonight, and when I handed it to him, I gave him the usual fatherly advice of how to use the stick.  Then he just did his thing, out of nowhere.

Hell, I am so happy about this, I don't care if he breaks anything.  It was one of the greatest things to experience in an otherwise bleak period in my life.

[Thank you, God. . .]"

Free my heart to feel again
Free my mind to understand
To run undeterred
Pull the blinders from my eyes
Let me see the endless skies
And drown here where I stand
In the beauty of the land

And all my life
It lay inside
For all my life

Tear this anger from my soul
Wash me clean and leave me whole
Leave me higher
Work my hands to make them strong
Lift my arms to carry on
That anywhere I go
To never be alone

And all my life
It lay inside
For all my life

We were always leaving
Since we started breathing
And running back no wonder
We are torn asunder

To give me life. . ."

Hit me back if you are interested and if you have any suggestions of where to meet before hand.  (Preferably somewhere near the club, like Alero (Mexican).  All are welcome.

Might be some military friends coming along. . .lol"

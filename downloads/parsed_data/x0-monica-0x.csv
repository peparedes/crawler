It made me miss my grandmom. It hits me from time to time that shes really gone. In the movie Mia and her grandmom spend a lot of time together and it made me want to go see my grandmom but then I realized that thats impossible. But thats enough about that.-Summer is finally over and school is unfortunately here on Thursday. I guess my summer was okay. I didn't really go on a vacation but I did have a fun summer. Well im gonna go. Bye.

well the past few days [with the exception of last night]have been pretty tough, most of you know why though so I ain't going to get into it. 

But I just wanted to thank Steph, Alex, Lisa and Sharon again for being there for me. You are my good friends and it meant a lot that you came. And know that I am there for you guys whenever and whatever time it is. We might go through some pretty rough times but hopefully we'll be friends for along time.

Well, I think last night was pretty fun :)
It helped me a lot.

Anyway though, some people are just not meant to be friends, or close friends. You can try so hard to be someones friend and if they don't want it than its not going to happen. So the best thing to do is just be laid back and let things happen I guess.
But in the past week I have found out quite a few things bout people, who I had no idea had things like this going on and im glad SOME people are opening up to me.
Well, tom. is finally Friday, I think I'm hanging out with Kim and whoever.--Kim, thanks for looking for songs.--Then, we'll see what im doing the rest of the weekend. Well I'm going to go, bye.

I haven't written in a while. I've been alright. Christmas was alright. And me and Kim decided that we were going to make some changes and make the new year better than the year we're in now. And so far our ""change"" has been okay. We decided to make the best of every opportunity..and well I guess you can say we have, last night I had some opportunities and i took them..and our plans for New Years Eve might be getting changed because of someone's circumstance (haha Kim)..but whatever happens im going to make the best of it. This upcommig year is an opportunity to make some changes and thats exactly what I plan on doing.(hopefully they'll be good changes)

"event","hey,
everything is blah lately...school especially makes me so upset; well not even school..its more like all my friends from school..everyone is always upset and doing stupid things..im not really anyones close friend in school besides kim and ashley, so i dunno half the stuff thats going on but i hear bits and pieces and it is just so upsetting being there..and i cant say things to people anymore like i wish i could because it would just be hypocritical..so i dunno..

but on a happier note we did good in bowing today..we won 3/4.. and it was on horrible lanes that were so dry and you had to keep your own score..then came dance..we didn't have a class because it was only me lisa and trish who decided to show up but i picked my costume for the solo.. but i still have no song...i thought i did but it is already being used (thanks anyway kim).

And lastly, i hope everyone else is doing okay..i know there are so many people who are in worst situations than me.. and i just want to say hold on..everything will be okay in time..just count on friends..and never feel like hurting yourself is the answer to any problem..there are so many other ways to deal with things..after hurting yourself the problem is still there and you have a scar(internal or external) to remind you of all your probems.

And to all my friends who have been there for me for so long..thank you so much..i may not show it all that well, but all of my friends mean so much to me..and i told many of you before, if you ever need a friend to talk to anytime,you know where to come.
Im going to go..bye.

Today had its good and bad points so far..School was okay.. i feel bad for some people though..rumors can really hurt someone..and some people need to grow up(you put it well there ashley)..anyway i try to stay out of it for the most part.
We got our champion shirts today for flag football for the after school league..and then tonight we have a game..its gonna be o0 so much fun..(sarcastic).
Yea and tom. when almost the whole school has off, i have to go in just because i couldnt pay for the fund raiser...yea so i have to go in and do work straight through from 8 till 12..and then what dont get done in school i have to do for homework caz it counts as a grade. Yea.. well to me it seems that all the people who couldnt pay are gettin punished for not being as wealthy as others..So I wanted to let them know that i think its unfair so I wrote a letter stating the predicament im in and letting them know my opinion on the whole thing and i took it to the activities office today after school. Well he said the letter was well written and he shook my hand and talked to me for a few minutes..but i still have to go in..but i think im going to go in tom. with my head held a little higher than i would have before just because i wrote that letter..o0k well im gonna go get ready for tonight..bye bye.

Today...Well of course no matter where you go theres going to be drama..esp. at an all girls school, since girls are the ones who start the drama most of the time. Although i've managed to stay out of it for the most part..a few of my friends were hurt today which means i was drug in it a little..but everyone is okay now..well mostly.
Then after school was bowling tryouts..and i made the team! haha i couldnt of done it without kate!
Then i came home and of course i hate being home so i was anxious to go to dance at 7. And at dance we looked at our costumes for the dance and what we picked out our teacher said she has to think about weather we can have it or not caz she said it might be to short..but it goes with the theme of our dance so i hope we can have that costume. Oo and then i had to get asked if i was doing the solo or not..i REALLY want to..but of course money is a barrier to happiness right now so i have to talk to my mom about that to see if we can get the money for it. 
And then i came home and things around the house got to me again..but on the plus side me and steph are okay again!! love ya steph!!!!!!!! haha...and steph you really have to eat ice cream and nerds.. its gooood! but you can only eat it if you are a ""cheeseball""..haha..good times man.

I've been doing alright i guess. Last week i didnt do much at all but go out like one day. Me and Mare took a walk around..it kinda made us both feel bad though talking about old times..and even talking about the present made me feel kinda upset caz everyone is changing and moving on..
Then Friday me kim and heather were walking around with tom andrew tim zack and dave. And we seen sean who is really cute..haha kim..but then he left. And me and kim slept over heathers..we haven't done that in a while so we got to talking..And saturday morning heather had to go to the eye doctors but she let me and kim sleep..when we got up we watched grind and made mac and cheese and pizza bites haha. then heather came home and we were all extra hyper so we were dancing..HAHA KIM..heather, wasnt she too funny.
Then later on was the lock in..it started out HORRIBLE caz i was in such a bad mood..but then it got better. After our awkward talk with Marie me kelly sharon lisa jess and steph kinda got to talking..and i think we are all okay now..thats what it seemed like that night anyway..and im okay with everyone now. Then sunday i basically slept all day and talked on the phone. 
Then today i went to kims grandmoms after school till like 5.then i came home and eventually got ready for dance.
So thats basically it besides..you know the feeling where you want to hug someone special who will make it seem like everything is okay, and u just want to stay in their arms..well that feeling has been around a lot lately..but i have been doing a pretty good job ignoring it.i guess..
Well im gonna go..Bye ByeZ.

My weekend was pretty fun.
On Friday i went to the mall,it was pretty fun..these two kids started talkin to me and Mare..then she left me with them haha..but she came back. 
Saturday was Kates party, i was a naughty school girl again. The party was fun.. besides a few times when people were actin weird.
Then on Sunday Me Kate and Ashley went to the Avril Lavigne concert..that was a lot of fun and then i slept over ashleys.
Then Monday we had off and me Ashley took a trip to dunkin donuts EXTRA EARLY! lol (well for me anyway) and we see her friend Brian so we hang out wit him for a while, caz he kinda made us lol..till i had to leave to go to the dentist..then later on i had dance.
So all in all my weekend was pretty exciting.
Oo and I also managed to get someone mad at me. I guess they had it commin though, although I am sorry. Well im gonna go bye byeZ.

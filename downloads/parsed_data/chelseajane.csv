I finished up school at Orono.
That sucked.
I hated it there.

Came back to work.

Over spring break I had met a Fabulous Boy... 

He's moved in with me now.
Yay! 

This means I spend all my time either, sleeping, cuddling, eating or working.

I start working overnights (mostly) again in a few weeks so we'll see how that goes.

The next sunny day I wanna go to the beach (If you wanna go call me!) And have a picnic and get a suburn and actually ENJOY summer."

I got home from class and just felt disgusted with myself.
I have a psych test. 
And I dont feel like I KNOW anything.
I'm so afraid of him pullng questions just out of his ass
And. And. I Just hate it.
Its such bullshit that the FIRST test we have (out of 3, the only grades we have in that class) 
Is over 4 chapters or 5 weeks of material. 
I sane person would have made it like. 3.
Seeing as the first one is bullshit.
But. Just to get a feel for the test?

Ugh. I just wanna scream.
I get so frustrated with myself when I have work to do.
I have to read a book and write a paper on it.
ANd have a meeting tomorrow with my english teacher.
Which I'm dreading.
UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My theatre class makes me wanna write beautiful poetry.
Which I've never ever been able to do.
But. I want pretty words to fill somepages. 

My mom and I got in a fight last night.
Online.
I felt like she was just being a hag to me 
AN dI was not in the mood to be called a spoiled little ungrateful bitch who's insecure.
Because if I wanted to know that i'd just look in the mirror thank you very much.
And especially coming from you fucking mother. 


Now I'm all In a Tizzy.

I dont wanna study. 
I dont wanna read.
I just want to eat pizza which makes me fat.
Which makes me depressed.
Which is unattrctive.
Which means I could quite possibly be alone forever. 

Do not eat cake for breakfast."

And watched some stupid video about everest.
And she yelled at us to come to class more.

Grar!

Character analysis.

I'm not really happy here. 

I'm shy.
And I dont know where to go to meet people.
I'm not the type to just sit my ass down with someone at lunch.

The few people I've met only want to hang out with me when they want something.
And then I'm done. 

I'm tired of being tossed away.

I'm not sure if I'll be back next year.
Right now it's not looking too bright. 

I feel totally dependant on shawn.
Even though we're technically broken up at the moment.
Its a weird weird complicated situation. 
But I hate it.
I hate feeling depednant on anyone.
I've always thought of myself as being able to do a lot on my own. 

I guess a lot of my loneliness here is just amplifying a lot of my already all over the place emotions. 

I hate feeling like everyone else has so much to offer and I have nothing to give.
And its everywhere.
In classes.
With friends.

I used to be smart and cool.
And now I just feel like I'm run over and passed by.

I dont know what I need. 
Or what my problem is.
But last night was a horrible night.
I have no one here that I can really vent to.
Which makes me always boohooing on the phone to shawn.
And there's only so much of that a boy can take. 
There's only so much crying that *I* can take.

I hope this is just an adjustment.

I totally need to get my shit together though.

Last night I stole some quarters out of my car and *gasp*
Did more laundry!

I ended up taking my english book down with me and reading it for the 1. 70 hours I was down there. 
And I barely made it through the 3 chapters. 
But I say this is b/c I was taking notes on it. 
So I can look smart in class in regards to discussion
Because my writing sucks. 

I assume. 

So. I fold my laundry up real quick.
And head for the elevator.
My head is kinda dizzy from the fucked up lighting in the basement.
And all the reading. 

I step on to the elevator.
Press 4.
Start rubbing my eyes and stretching and just spacing out.

""Ding"" 
I'm kinda startled.
There's a girl standing in the door of the elevator waiting to get on.
I step off. 

Walk down the hall. 
To the very end.
Becuase thats where my room is.

When I left My roomate was watching MTV and just lounging.
With her little lamp on.

I push the door open and its dark.
""Damn, she went to bed."" 
I push it open a little more.
There's light coming form the corner of the room I can't see
Which is my corner.
And I know I turned off my lights and shut my computer off. 


Then! 
I notice that... well there isn't even a BED on her side of the room.

What. 
The.
Fuck.

I think. 

I felt like I was in some kind of fucked up dream

Then. 

I looked at the door. 
It was room 130.
Not 430.

The girl that got onto the elevator had hit the button to go up too.
And I was all confuddled.

Thank GOD no one was in room 130
*That I know of*
Or around watching me.
Because thats the BOYS floor.

Nevermind that today is christmas.
December 25th hasn't been christmas for a while now.
But its ok to go through the motions and eat lots of food.
And exchange gifts.

My mom got me a comforter set for my room.
Its green and its that silky fuzzy stuff.
I can't tell if I like it or not.
We shall see. 

I got the Jesse McCartney Cd.
Which I asked for.
*sigh*
He sounds like a one man Nsync.

Oh well. I'll just give it  back to my mom and she'll love it.

I got some jammie pants too.
they're cute.

And then mostly just not so fancy stuff for school.
Like... gladware.
Wrinkle Releaser.
Laundry Basket.
Cups.
Cute sheets.

Blah.
I'm glad christmas is over.
Now we can put our little table top christmas tree back into its garbage bag.
And back into the basement.
Predecorated (At least we premanufactured it ourselves a few years ago instead of at walmart)
Ick.

I got my mom some PJ pants.
ANd a shirt.
ANd a gift certificate to a store.

I dont mean to sound bitter.

I'm just upset that its christmas and I feel entirely alone.

I can't wait for school to start so i can be around REAL people.


Last night we went to my aunts house.
She made homemade Bailey's.
And gave two bottles to my grandpa.
They taste like shit.

But I got to see my cool cousin.
And his baby.
He's so fucking cute.

I want to babysit one.

lol 

My aunt made some nasty ass popcorn cake.
Its like... a rice kripsy treat with popcorn 
And m&ms And peanuts.
And stuff.
Which my mom hated.
ANd spit out.
And threw away. 
My aunts boyfriend assisted the throw out.
Entertaining.
Then my aunt turns around and was like Isn't it GOOOOD??
My moms laughing and saying Yup! Its awesome! 
Tims laughing.
I'm laughing.
My aunt goes ""Yeah, well, I didnd't know if I'd like it. 
I didn't realize my Nuts were so sweet!""
Meaning. She got honey roasted peanuts.

Soda threw the nose.

Mmm.. babies.

Its 2 something.
I guess I'm gonna go nap.
I have to work tomorrow morning. 
8am-1pm.
Joyous joyous.

College Comp 11-12:15 TTh
Fundamentals of Acting 6-9:30 M
Sociology 1:10-2 MWF

More than a lot of things on this earth.

The other night at work
I was watching something
About the bible
And matrixing it
To get other meanings.
How it ""predicted"" certain events.
*confused face*
I didn't really catch a lot of it.
It was the last 15 mins that I got.
but It was talking about how theres two things that say
the worlds gonna end in 2012.
And I'm just such a pansy for stuff like that.

I think the mayan had something about that... same year...
Which... freaks me out... 

But then it ended saying that it can't really predict the future because you don tknow what to look for...??

Got up at 5, 
realized my grandparents were MIA.
(they went to... old navy? wtf?)
they came home after I raided the fridge 
With no results
and ordered a pizza instead.

I get paid tomorrow.
A sad check.
Compared to what I've been making lately.
Which is pooey seeing as I have 8 billion things to pay for.
Car Payment
Car registration
And a mondo Cell Phone Bill

*sigh*

I've had to pay them for liek 2 weeks.
But. Blah.

Tomorrow I'm going to the movies with nick.
Not really sure details on that.
But I need human contact.
I just about orgasmed all day long when Iw as hanging out with Rose.
Thats dangerous.

Watched the new John mayer show.
called ""John mayer has a tv show""
So fucking funny.
Its like... tom green but cleaner.
But not really tom green?
Just the sarcastic crap.
I love it.
God he's hott.

I'm itching to read a good book.
I need to go to Barnes and nobel this week.

I also need to lay off the HOT ASS SHOWERS.
Its drying out my skin way too much.

I get to find out if I'm getting the fuckers ripped out.
On one hand, its gonna suck ass.
On the other... I'm really tired of getting strep all the time.
And now, it feels like food get caught on them.
Gross!! 
I keep having to gargle water to feel ""clean"" 

I keep sneezing.
Wouldn't that suck to get a cold and have your tonsils out
AND be on your period?

Oh yes. It would.

I'm just thinking of worst case scenarios.
I guess if you added the runs to that,
You'd really be in for it.

Ok. Enough gross things.

GOOOOOOO MEE!! 

*sigh*

So I was all excited that I FINALLY got some mail from school.
About course registration.

So... 
First I find out
I can't take any science classes...
Because they all START in the fall.

Meaning i'd have level 2 classes availbale only and that just isn't gonna work.

So I'm like ok...
And she says I can take English, Psych, Sociology and something else.
And I'm like ok.

So we figure shit out. 


English: TTH 9:30-10:45
Psych: TTH 9:30-10:45 only. Or MWF at some weirdass time.

So English Becomes 11-12:15

Sociology: MWF 1:10 -2... ok...

Then we have the joy of finding an extra class.

When everything is full.
And I have like TWO options
Of Artsy fartsy classes,
Or Cultural Diversity shit.

BLAH!

So She says there's a theatre class online.
Online? Wtf is the point of /that/?

Then there's a Fundamentals of Acting on Monday.
6-9;30.

Dont ask but I thought she said MWF.
I'm all ""Whoo! Acting"" For like 3 mins.

ANd Then im thinking holay fuck.
Way to take up a lot of time.

So I'm like no,
I really need to be flexible so I can get a job.
(Which, I really dont NEED a job. 
I could SURVIVE not working.
And just use the Benefit $$.
But I'm dumb)

So she's like ok... 
And puts me in some Art of Listening to Music class.
Which is where my English WAS.

So that go pushed back to 8am.

So. Not only are my classes earlier.
But. I'm taking some class I don't even really wanna take.
And sounds like a bunch of FLUFF.

Plus, don't take something you love and chop it up into a million bits and analyze it.
Or it will suck.

So then she has to call Immunizations 
b/c I didn't send my proof of being poked in the ass.
Or arm. whevever they poke me. i dunno.

So she lets me go to do that.

In the mean time.

I find out by looking online that the music class is gonna blow.

And that the acting class is only monday nights.

So I call her back.

Leave a message.

Call her back a few minutes later.

Now, Its not snowing here.

I feel bad.
because apparently it is there.

Dont know if ppl are trying to get out early.

So. When i call her back a few minutes later.
And tell her, I didn't realize it was just Monday,
I'd like to take the Acting class.
She's all:

""*sigh* Alright. I'll see what I can do. Good bye.""

So now I feel like a total bitch.

But you know.
It sucks.
That I dont have ANY real choices on what I'm taking here.
That NEXT semester, I'm gonna be all fucked up 
Because I'm taking classes from the usual 3 semesters.
In one semester.
And the prerequisites are all jumbled.

Ugh.

So now I'm worried I'm gonna get fucked over.
And that she's gonna hate me forever.
And that.

I suck.

 

I hate college!"

It took me an hour to get home.
There was stand still traffuck on the highway.
There were like 4 cars in a row off the road.

When I was almost to my exit some asshole in a SAAB
BLEW past me.
Going at least 70.
I and everyone else were going like 40.
Fucker.

Anyway!

I have two days off from work! 

Hurrraaaah!! 

I need to find something fun to do.
If I sit at home on my ass I'm gonna be pissed. 

Hopefully Ill be getting a laptop soon.
A kick ass one.

That can play the sims2.
Holay.

I'm so excited for school.
I hope they send me housing stuff today.

I actually was occupied on the phone for most of it.

"event","That nature rains on flames we made 
Should tell you everything is not broken 
No everything is not broken 
If everythings not fine 
If everythings not fine 

And I will find the colours in my life 
The places and times it was now 

And I will walk outside on my own into the light 
The kind of clarity that only comes to me on Sunday's shine 
~Everything Is Not Broken 

over you 
I'm never over 
over you 
something about you 
It's just the way you move 
the way you move me 
I'm so good at forgetting 
and I quit every game I've played 
but forgive me love 
I can't turn and walk away 

back to you 
it always comes around 
back to you 
I walk with your shadow 
I'm sleeping in my bed 
with your silhouette 

should have smiled in that picture 
if it's the last that I'll see of you 
it's the least that you could not do 

oh I will 
leave the light on 
I'll never give up on you 
leave the light on 
for me too 
~Back to you

the day she called up and came to me 
covered in rain 
dinnertime shadowing 
and as the clothes spun 
we spooned and I knew I was through 
when I said, ""I love you"" 
~Covered In Rain

did you expect to kiss me one time 
while looking at me with the same eyes ever again? 
so come on and face it 
so come on and face it 
it's time that we say it 

you can cross the line whenever you want to 
I'm calling it love soon 
close your mind and waste some time if you have to 
I'm calling it love soon 
it's not about you now 
it's what we are 
~Love Soon

I'm walking a straight line 
stepped on all of the cracks this time 
I don't care I'm not moving aside 
for anyone 

outside in the underground 
proud in the rain 
outside in the underground 
there's no way out of here today 

I raise my head up to the sky again 
and make my way alone 
I'm never home 
but I've stopped searching 
cause the city told me so 
it all comes down 
down to me 
~Outside In The Underground

I know it's early 
And you hardly even know me but 
I want your love so bad 
So bad I'm bout to fuck it up 

Could you tell me what to say? 

You must have heard that line 
About your eyes a million times 
And now you're holding out to hear about your chin 
I bet that that could get me in, let me in 

Could you tell me what to say? 
Tell me what to say.. 
~Tell Me What To Say

This coulda been a slow song 
A laundry list of all my wrongs 
But at the end of the day 
This is my beautiful disaster piece I've made 
Gonna laugh I know the pain is here 

This will all make perfect sense someday 
I'll be A-Okay 
There's got to be a reason for the rain 

I don't understand the numbers 
But my faith is in the math 
And come someday these twisted ties will tangle 
And we'll look back and laugh 

And to all the hearts I've broken 
And the ones that once broke mine 
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time 
Gonna look you in the eye and say 

This will all make perfect sense someday 
I'll be A-Okay 
There's got to be a reason for the rain 
~Perfect Sense

Do you ever get the feeling 
that we started in the middle 
or have you ever had the sense 
that we've been lying just a little 
i mean come on 
its not like we've known ourselves that long 

and i cant say i really blame you 
for being bored with the beginning 
always staring at the score 
just to figure out whos barely winning 
but dont you know 
there is a reason strong,move slow 

and im okay 
if you're okay with 
wasting time 
but when we trace 
you always see the bottom line 

we are tracing 
i hope you know 
we are tracing 

and if you want to know the moment 
i knew that i was still alone 
i found i never learned your number 
i only stored it in my phone 
you'd think by now 
id know the shape of calling home 

and im okay 
if you're okay with 
wasting time 
but when we trace 
you'll always see the bottom line 

we are tracing 
i hope you know 
we are tracing 
we're both alone 
we are tracing 
we are tracing 

did you ever get the feeling 
that we started in the middle 
or have you ever have the sense 
that we were lying just a little 
i mean come on 
its not like we knew ourselves that long 
~Tracing

now everything inside me tells me that I should run to you and throw my arms around you. 
Hold your steaming crying cheek against my own and 
tell you nothing's wrong 
but wrong was what you were 
when you forgot that we were going on, we were going on 
We were going strong 
~Why Did You Mess With Forever

The last three kinda hit me...
I've been cool most of the day actually... 
But.. now... 
I'm alright. 

*sigh* 
I know a few people think I'm stupid.
For having been so upset...

I didn't have to work overnight.
But I had CPR/First Aid class at the center.
At 9am.
I went to bed at 8pm because I was exhausted.

I got some really good sleep.

Then went to my class.
Got gushed over in the room.
Because my mom tells everyone 
About my going to school.
And being a nurse (maybe)
And my boss tells ppl I'm awesome too.

So that was cool.

Then I found out I didn't really didn't have First aid.
B/c someone cancelled.

So I got out at 11:35.
(I really hope I passed my CPR test)
I had planned on not being home until 4:30 anyway.
And I thought my boss might be working at the house alone.

I called in and asked if they needed anyone.
There were a few hours in between when the double coverage was coming in.
So I stopped by.

We made lunch.
And I got to hang out with my boss.
Who's fucking awesome.
And just generally apprecited how damn cute those girls are.
Despite the moments when I want to tear my hair out when they're not cooperating.

One girl was making all these awesome silly faces.
And just being cool.
And I had a really good time.
being able to just hang out.
And watch GREASE! 
And dance around.
And not have to stress out about getting someone ready in two hours.

Plus my favorite co-worker (other than my boss) was there.
And I just had a nice time being social.

Then i left there.
Stopped at wendy's and had fabulous fries.
omgdelicious.
lol

and came home.
and now Im being all mushy over ben.

We get to hang out tonite!
And watch nemo!
And be cuddly.
And sleep.
and and and and
He's making my bed up all cool.
Cuz.
Well.

Then we went to eat at Bugaboo Creek.
Holay orgasmicness. 
I love Snowbird Chicken.

Then we walked around the Boulevard for.... 2.5 hours.
Or 3.5 miles. Or osmething. 
With breaks on park benches here and there.
It was nice.
I felt lovey.
And we talked mucho grande.

I can't say enough that I love that he lets me talk things out.
And listens to me.
And lets me just ramble.
And then makes me feel all better about it.

But. Mmm... sexy military haircuts and uniforms.

I am smitten like you wouldn't believe.

It's funny. 
Alot of people I've dated have had great qualities,

Ben apparently just ""ran away with the good stuff...""


I wanna see the incredibles.

I totally made it through my 6 day consecutive work week.
Yayness.
I was scared.
I even did it on very little sleep.

I have 106.5 hours on my time card this week.
$$$.
Which is good beacuse.
Well. Eating at applebees and gerards and movies all the time.
Tends to be a little expensive.

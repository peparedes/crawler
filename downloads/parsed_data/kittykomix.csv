"event","Well hi there :3 Been a while since I've posted here. I was talking to Neesan about how I should pick this thing back up. My journal turned 2 the other day o: It has the same birthday as Oka-chan.

Anyway lots and lots to ramble about but there's no humanly possible way I could get into all of that right now. Im more or less posting this right now because if I don't know I wont later =w=' You know how it is..

Anyway.. I'll randomly throw crap in here o.o; I should really use it more often. I kinda wanted to go and use my dA journal. but Eh. I kinda need to sort other things out before I can pick up my internet life up in other areas again. I can't wait to get back to it though.. Internet may not be a ""life"" as far as many people are concerned.. But it's a big part of mine /: and I need to get back to it. I've been borderline insane lately.. not because of withdrawal. But eh. That's all for another time. SO yeah.
Laik.. Hai again."

Eh... I'm so short on time nowadays o_o  I dont get to work on my art as much as I'd like or do Gaia or talk with people as much as I want to. But I guess there is always a good thing in every bad situation... I mean.. with time passing faster than I can think, I guess I'll be 18 sooner. *le sigh*

I hope everything is okay with Clara ._. I know she snapped the laptop or something like that, but Im just hoping shes okay, calm wise x.x; I know its a big thing.. but... I dont want her to be a nervous wreck like I can get to be sometimes D:

._. I really have no use of this LJ to be honest. Not anymore really. I made it last year to rant out some things  that were going on. I've deleted those entries since. But well,  Sometimes it seems so much more consoling when you actaully express it to someone, when they're there rather. And more so not minding the ranting. So masybe I'll keep it around for those times.. I guess. o.o

"event","HAHAHAHAHAHA. Lets see. I must rant at you inimaginable people who I have to tell myself actaully read my blog to prevent going insane.
Okay. First of all.
My job. Quite complicated really. I have a feeling that they're not entirely satisfied with my work quality. Im tryng hard. But. Its a lot more complicated than  I let lead on....
Id like to work at walmart. Eh. This is so stupid.. What am I doing? For one, I wouldn't get taxes taken out, being a minor. I don't mind social security getting taken out really. I don't see why people make a big deal about it...
They would also pay quite a bit more. They also hire a bunch of braindead teenagers to push carts (I actaully wouldn't mind that)...so it couldn't be too bad.... Plus its probably burning good calories....

Neighbors gave me some CD's to make copies of. Ah.. I was bored. Sure why not...
WELL.
Dad is such a moron... He always goes in my room and moves things around.. its so stupidly annoying.. I mean... -stupid-
He now blames me though.
He does this.. all the time really.. I was reading a book. I placed a bookmark in my book, sat it down on my desk and left to go get food. I come back, my book is thrown on the floor, with the bookmark tossed someplace out. He claimed that I needed to put it away... 
Huh..
To my standards... a desk is far more ""put away"" than the floor

Oye.. whatever... She now needs the disks back by morning because shes going to a concert to get them autographed. I fail. I completely fail living here. I cant wait for November... I'm either moving to Cleveland or Cincinatti, depending on how things turn out.. This is so ridiculous..

OH YEAH.. and.. I've got laryngitis now, probably from screaming and begging for dad to leave me alone......

Eh. Im done. Ja."

The thing we're wanting to do, as inexpensive as it may seem, there's actually a whole nother part to it.. Okay like 20 other parts to it.. It just all adds up and has like a domino effect on the main picture.

"event","Hmm... I havnt been here in literally months. Like half a year. Kay I guess it's only fair if I fill you in. Gosh I feel like I'm talking to myself o.o; (Not that its anytihng new XP) I doubt anyone comes here. Hee >w< Hm This could be fun.

I always wonder.. If  Earth and the internet still exist 200 or something years from now, what will it be like- as far as the internet goes I mean to say.. Will there be people.. like people today who have hobbies of collecting old strange artifacts and collecting information, or study up on random historical figures? I mean.. Is everything we do online just entertainment, perhaps amusement for people hundreds of years from now to mock and laugh upon when we currently think is   normal (for internet standards, of course) and all that.. Does that make sense? o.O I wonder what people would say when they randomly come across abandoned 400 year old forums. What are they gonna think when they come acrossed old profiles, of people who'se age counter is 475, but have been ""Offline for 364 Years, and 37 minutes"" ..Would they be creeped out by it? You know that feeling you get when you're near a dead body.. not that it can suddenly lash out and attack you with a jar of mayonnaise or something..its just that level of eeriness. What I'm saying is, will that sensation of eeriness come acrossed them, or will it be something so common that they just hit the back button.. I think there will be different people, even more different types of people then there are today, since times change and new personalities constantly emerge. So there may be some sicko's out there who stalk the dead. AKA us now. Nice to know we wont be completely forgotten though. Guess it depends on how you look at it. EH, I could ramble about that forever,since possiblities are just insane and endless. What I was originally planning to do is fill you in on the past half year. By the way, if anyone IS happening to read this, hundreds of years from now... ..... ....Kay I got nothin.. But hi. How ya doin?


,>.> Okay shut up, it didnt happen <.<
But.
Let me get back to what I was trying to say
Okay let me BRIEFLY, then in detailed explain the last halfyearthingie
1.whee
2. Two anime conventions
3. Job
4. New outlooks
5. New peoples
6. Old peoples who are back
7. Ats and stories and whatnot
8. Plans and crap
9. aetargsgsasvfs
10.. um.. Kura XD?
11. home businesensses?


Okay.. Lets see.
As you know when I lasted talked to you, I was planning and awaiting my first ever anime con, the 2007 Ohayocon. That went awesomely. Some plans about it changed though. Drift and I met up for the second time. Unfortunately Gaa and Chibi we'rent there, since college kinda sucks. I suppose. I didnt know where Clara was gonna be and things were hectic so we coudlnt contact each other. Well. I think I saw her but didnt know what she was wearing till I asked her later..  I think she was actaully someone who I said ""I like your hat"" too XD
I got some nifty things from there, now that I think back, I did ramble about it in my DA blog. So.. if you like me enough , just go over there.. you 47th century stalkers.. xO
EH, fine I'll explain it XD. I got some pictures.. I'll one day put online. Some people even took my pictures but Im yet to find them online anywhere. Maybe thats another thiongs people in the future wont have to worry about. Picture searching on dialup will be a term of gibberish.

We didnt get to do everything we wanted to do ceertain things.. but eh.. That will change soon.

We also went to Anime Punch for March/April.So well. It was different so...

I wore the Ouran suit again, I couldnt bother with a wig..

Forgive me, my attention span is randomly deciding to drain.

Eh......

Screw it, I'll just get the important crap xP

I lost contact with a LOT of people.. But Im trying to get back to talk ing with them again. Cause yeah o.o
Though, I've met a few people as well. Some of them are decent people.. some of them... well... eh >_>

ANYWAAAyyyyy

I got a job, thanks to one of the new peoples.  Its at a petstore. Nothin fancy but its interesting. When I was first visiting and applying they had a few kittens, all looked the same. By the time I was working there was one kitten who stayed for a while, and was just sold recently. SO now Im waiting for the next litter of kittens to be dropped off XD

There's a huge turtle that walks around the place, named Bumper I believe. Hes like 8. Strange thing that makes me think is they live like 150 years, so I've been told. So. That means they would out live the owners childrens' children, ..no? ..Or maybe I suck at math. So it only makes me think of that whole internet thing all over again. Well lets not backtrack here, eh? Whats interesting is, he eats dog biscuits. He must be a freaking smart turtle.. Cause I havn't been around him too much yet. But, I mean He must h\ ave saw that I was feeding the hamsters and everything cause he came up to me and nudged my on multiple occasions. I figured he was just pushing me out of the way cause right after wards.. He would put his face up to the glass and just ... stare...at.. those hamsters. Cause yeah XD. I dunno. But then bosslady explained that he eats dog bisquits so hes probably just waiting to be given one. SO she when to get some outta the little.. place thingies.. and... I didn't know turtles that big could run.. but.. yeah XD And I thought I was special or something cause he was following me around XD Hah. He just wanted dog biscuits xO He was chasing the little kitten around...Yeah so kitten must have gotten the impression that they were freinsd.. well..not only do they give him the dog treats, they also give him a giant thing of lettuce..Little kitten was coming up to him to investigate, and... the turtle.. hissed... at the cat o.O ""MAH LETTUCE D<""

EHh >.>

I'd love to ramble about the rats and tarantulas.. but.. remember that whole thing about my attention span declining? XD Yeah."

I'm not extremly worried about it anymore. Cuase whatever happens, happens, eh? Though, I still -am- going to try to do whatever means nessesary to graduate early. Not extremely frantic about getting emancipated anymore. I mean, it would be nice - if i do in fact graudate early, that is. So it's either move out in November, or move out when and if I do finish school before I'm supposed to..?
It's confusing xD; Oh well..
Probably gonna stay there a year at the least.

Oh, oh oh. I've almost completed my costume for the con. I just ordered my patch. The only things that i need now are the undershirt and tie.. but techincally, i have replica's that arent exactly the sa,e. but are -passible- at the least. Mannn I can't wait til con time.

I put in a job application tomorrow. Kinda freaked though cause its like.. right after you get home, you realize more things you could have said on your ap. Meh. Whatever.

"event","Wow. Havn't been here in a bit I suppose. Alright here's the jist.

What you should know:
I am over any and all emo-ness
I no longer really care if this thing works out. Whatever happens, happens. I'll deal. And make the best out of it.
Of course, I do hope things play out how I have previously planned... however, I'm not going to whine and complain about it. Sheesh, I was starting to even annoy myself. Also, I've learned to tell people sorry I just can't right now. So. I'm not racked up to my neck in tasks anymore. THAT, amazing and almost unbelievably is is one of the most peaceful things imagable -.o Alright, so no more questionable emoness from now on. =3 Kay? alrighty then.

Okay, lately Khaos hasn't been able to be on aim. Sad.. very sad. We got this anime club thing that is pretty amusing. They're planning a skate party of things. I'm thinking about using my florida visit to catch the last meeting before winter break and the skate party. Also, I""m trying to reestablish a ""irl""

things that would be involved:
getting a job to-
   a - attend ohayocon (more info on that in a moment)
   b - donate to anime club
   c - spoil friends
   d - begin saving for car
   e - begin saving for house
   f - kitty wants anime and manga
   g - upgrade comp
   h - ....dsl....

Also, one of my limited to half a hand numbered irl friends may be moving. So I need to get her something awesome. And be able to somehow visit her. I think. I think she will be moving withen the same area though..? who knows.. I dont really know -.-

Okay. Ohayocon. I have been trying to attend this convention for four years. FOUR .. YEARS... And this January. .I will attend my very first anime convention, as Hikaru Hitachiin. <3 For those of you who watch Ouran Koukou Host Club, you better be able to tell the twins apart. For those of you who dont watch it.. get on youtube this very instant or I will be forced to spork you. As for my partner. My dear friend kura will be taking the part of Kaoru Hitachiin. And.. we're going to be on stage :3 And have the awesomest skit, like ever.

Note to self: You need
Suit - 3 pieces
Patch
Watch
Shoes  - done
Wig - reddish brow
Wig - Pink
Beezleneef doll (?)
Tie

... ductape.. lots of it..

:ahem: thank you :3


ahhh ... i must get on gaia and start bumping for a new totally awesome RP. -^o^-"

When I was 8, I wrote this ona scrap piece of paper, folded it up, ,and hit it inbetwen a board on the medicine cabinate part of teh bookcase. Okay. Dad  found it like an hour later. I told him I was just goofing off, but whatever.

I half-conciously wrote myself a note to my alter-ego, aka me now. The message, short and sweet. Dont get disctracted. Dont let some guy sweep you off your feet. Dont let some one screw you over. Dont forget your ambitions. Dont betray your friends, your family, or yourself. Dont let someone change you. Dont let someone live for you. The list could go on..

Well.. I've just about (<i>about</i>) broken every promise to myself. o.O; Irony? I THINK NOT! Er. Well, you pretty much know why, if you've been brave enough to actually read my rantings. Need I go on. I just wanted to  not the message I *attempted* to send in time to myself.. But some how, well, it worked.. and failed on various levels. But I guess I can at least try to work with what I have from here out with an 8 year olds morals. SURE WHY NOT ... o_o;????"

Don't get me wrong, I'm not all into that fortune telling thing, but I do think  dreams can link to irl things. I've had dreams, and have them come true the next day. I see that as a message.. not really a fortune telling thing.
Well, the first one was about this place I used to go to a lot. Kinda like an indoor mall, fused with Parrott Middle School, which SOMEHOW I remember the layout to, and I only went there for like a month. Well, it's sort of like, the main selection of movies is out front, I pace around, trying to decide what I want to see, and somehow find a (very huge) passage way, that no one knows about for some reason. I take it, and I find this huge room with hall ways to different rooms with even more auditoriums to see movies in. It's sort of weird. Somehow theres another guy there, and he doesnt want any part of it.. it says its stupid and someone could die. Huh?? Okay.. >> So I go in and watch the opening theme of the Digimon Movie. (idk XD.. I used to obsess over that movie) This is about where it cuts off.
This next one is cut into two parts. The first one, therse this movie house, with like 92 rooms. and even more hidden ones).. I drive by, wander around.. find out the ladies who work there are IN FACT vampires, and the leader is a zombie. So Yeah.. No movie thank you. I was looking around ,jsut making sure ""no one would die"". The next part, includes two of my old childhood friends Tomtom and Faith. For some reason, were hanging out by the woods. Faith has some strange idea to try and set traps for the cars on the street nearby. Not even, thinking - I say how about we set some sort of road block, ie - turtle - make cars ,go by onto the weak part of the road, and fall through directly into the hole of lava or whatever.  Tom does this, Faith follows.. Then I'm all - dude, thats mean how can you (wasnt it my idea??) For some reason my name is like Tojo in all of this. Okay, so after a weird series of bad timed events, we end up in that 92Galore Cinema. The leader zombie had been busy killing his own minions, (the vampires) and stuff, so theres only like 3 or 4 of them.  I'm about to make a running kick at one of them, before Tom/faiths family knows whats going on. Alright. FOR SOME REASON THEY HAVE ICECREAM - and this is the zombies undiscovered weakness..  THATS why the zombies arent attacking THEM.. >> okay. Before I can use this tactic, the dream cuts off. And now for the final, and utmost freakist part. I'm walking out of this ve~ry fancey movie theater, and as I turn the corner to head for the main door, theres this doctor guy,... with his head... in a wall.. >> I ask if hes okay, and he yells at me not to leave. I tell him hes on crack or something, and then he like literally throws me back in the main hall./gathery-ishtype room Okay, that was uncalled for - so im about to go  knock his face in,  and I turn the corner, and the vampires already got him o.O SOOO yeah. I take off, and the exit disapears..  So this means only one thing, I have to go and kill the evergrowing army of vampires, and the zombie leader, Merrs. However - this is whre I wake up. If theres ever another sequel, I'll let you know.



ALSO !! I dont have any school work for the next week. My list of things I have to do, has shribvled up to about 5 things.. And it rocks.."

Finally.. Found my old deivantart not too long ago. Dude.. I'm almost ashamed of it.. My art style keeps constantly changing. RIght now my current obsession is like a very creepy combination of chibi mixed with a dash of like esome sort of flaming noodle thing.

Blah.. now I want chow mein, but we only have shrimp flavor. I'm not quite in the raman mood, it's more of a wet noodle.. Chow Mein is dry.. And I have no udon.. Man, I never have Udon.. It's sad, is what it is. BUt then again, how many people keep pencil sized noodles around  their house. Raman - eaten by college people ... Chow mein - eaten by people who have the extra 50 cents.. poor udon is merely a victum of circumstance (lawl - theres that word again) .. doesnt anyone love mr udon? Well, I do!! Okay.. I'm talking about noodles again. Thank you lyssa..


Okay, sorry about my previous questionable emo rants. Yeah.. I'm back to normal.. If there is such a state. Hah.. Alright...Do you ever have one of those days.. Where you just wish you could just like .. idk.. work .. like all the stuff you have to do.. and just work your face off?? Idk.. It's weird.. It'sa bit scary, actaully..






YES!!! Okay. I'm gathering more and more cosplay materials for my future  cosplay site mo-bob..
Trying to buy this one blue ""go go"" wig, which should be perfect for Sailor Mercury in the cosplay set me and khoas.. maybe lyssa .. and .. ohcrapmayberobert?? are going to do..  It's to poke fun at our very strange Parody fan dub we made .... more on that in a moment..

I'm trying to see if anyone will also want to make a WhoGIrl cosplay set, maybe a samurai chapmloo, caboy bebop, trigun, hunter x hunter, battle angel alita, and the list could go on and on... but you get the idea.. I want to cosplay... bad.. and with sets...

OKay, the fandub..
Basically.. My friends... as awesome as they are, somehow  - i dont even remember how - talked me into this fandubbing thing. Which, hey! That's awesome, considering I WANNA BE A V/A ~~

New outlook on life chapter 57partBsequence92q


Actually, no. It's not that simple. I'm sure to any other person its just. ""Girl.. you need to quit getting wrapped up in things. Lately I've been back to my childish constantly-optomistic, theres a bright side to everything fantasy world. I like being optomistic. It keeps me from being one of those people who explode on a pin drop.. I fear becoming that. Maybe that is the root of my problems. Fear of becmoing my parents. Hah.. I need to visit a phycologist to explain my childhood now?

No no.

See, I like to have a serious outlook. For if I am serious, I will be taken seriously. Sometimes people take me as a joke. This is fine when I am joking. But lately.. dude.. It's like when the jokes stop, the whole conversation dies. I'm sick of it man, and I need to get a grip of myself. I'm not emo, I say again and again. But really.. What the heck do I got to do to just be Optomistic, but serious..I used to be able to read people so easily. And lately, since getting up to my neck, I havnt been on the constant updating worl of what is what.. Does that make sense? Well if you understand it, please simplify it for me. Any psycologists in the audiance care to help for the  declining sane pocky sucker?

Sorry to ramble.. It's helping

I guess what I mean to say is. I just need everything to stop. I'm going to be 17 soon. But I feel 47.. Why do I have to work so much? Is it because I was a slacker when I was younger and now I'm carrying the weight of my own chains? Is it because I'm going to excel and probably be richer than all the other people who dont quite seem to have as much work? Or am I just one of those people who are doomed to work in a cubical for all their life.. And have no life.. I want to be a voice actress. I want to write stories, and illustrate comics. Maybe work for pixar.. Or Studio Ghibli.. Why must I have to do things like Professional Assorted Toothpick Couting if im going to be an actress/artist??


Its a stupid waste of my precious time which is constantly being sucked down the drain.. Dude.. I want to live my life for the moment, but why do I feel like I fricking and living it for everyone else too?
Why do i feel like im being leeched off of?? Am I being selfish..

I dont think so..


I'm probably just being a baby, and need to suck it up. Tomorrow is a new day.. A new opportunity to get as far away as possible from a direct train ride to the cubicals as possible..


AH..I want cake.. An exact 5 inch slice, yellow cake layerd with chocolate icing..


Yes.."

alright. I've decided what my blahg must be used for. MY DREAM LOG. >>
ya.. A couple years back I wanted to use the settings in my dreams for webcomics. If i keep note of them somewhere, maybe I wont forget them so easily.

Alright. Me and a few freinds are walking in what I believe to be town square.. I've never been to NY, put I plan on it some day. This freaky business Mr. Rockafeller man approaches and some sort of milisecond sequence occured. He's mad that I don't use his shampoo or something like that. He threatens me that he's going to ""get me"" and hes going to send King Kong on me. My friends start laughing and shoo him off, and I'm standing there like an idiot trying to remember if King Kong is the monkey or the FishSquid/Turtle guy in the far realms of my mind. Anyhow. He tells me that he's going to get me. So I'm thinking I need to stay out of a public place to keep other people out of danger. It's frickin NY, right? Yeahy. That doesnt last for long.SooOOo theres this weird tall building. Its lie a mall/movie theater/ library/ casino thing of some sorts. The first floor is like a small lounge area, below that is like a basement parking place. For some reason thats the entracnce, but thew main doors are on the first floor. Above that i the casino, then the movie theater, then the library. ((II have no idea.. I got bored in my dream and I couldnt pick which would be more fun to have king kong rampange through? Dont as me.. As the keeper of dreams. He visits every second thursday of october.)) Anyway. So my friends some how get me convienced to go in here. We start watchign a movie, but im not like paying attention, cause i realize this is where its all goin down. One of the rooms is playing the recent version of King Kong (how original?) and the other room is playing like some  21st edition of Titanic.  I realize whats going on, but my friends hacve all gone nuts having thwir fun in different parts of this weird building. I see a guy over by the staircase, looks like hes having a heart attack - and right away i know hes stunned at the sight of a giant ape trying crawling around on the street. (Btw.. its no long NY now... some how its just a busy city street). .. I know everything in my dreams, when I choose to..RIGHT..OKAY so, I use the c-stick to get a full view of everything (shut up ...) It turns out Rockafeller has the police blocking off the main way. Yeeah lotta good thatd do. Theyre *evil* police man in this dream, guys. Okay so, King Kong is like on his knees looin through the door at the people, snagging everyoen who makes a run for the elevator.. (I'm on the stair well, out of reach) Okay now, I run down the stair well to get a good look at hte first floor, without being in reach. See, usually in my dreams i automatically know the layout. This time I decided to ""learn"" the lay out. After doign that for no apprant reason, I ran back upstairs and got mobbed for blocking the movie. I run into the library part, yelling for alanna.. Amanda's having her baby .. hah.. okay.. wheres alanna?? Im screamin for her, and shes yelling back at me CONVERSATIONALLY.... okay.. um GET OVER HERE ALANNA D< .. She frollocks over.. King Kong tears down the wall.. I wake up.. I was a bit freaked for a second , thinking I landed outside on a matress in a dumpster..

Okay thats enough for now, ne?"

"event","..but here I am! Okay. I have so much crap going on in the bowling ball attached to my neck, that I must type it and see if it sounds sane. Not that I need to prove that.. I jus twant to se ewhat it looks like and then laugh at it.
Here goes.
It's mom's birthday. Yeah. I forgot to put the card in the mail a few days ago on account of I didnt retirence the address in time. I kinda did, but I forgot I had it kinda.  Blargh. At the same time i DIDNT forget I just didnt feel like remembering because this week has been so chaotic. Like Wednesday or Thursday, I got over stressed and litereally passed out. Good thing I was sitting in bed. So I was out for a couple hours, so say my friends. Alrigtht, I'm in this RP, okay? And my character is another whackjob, nothing new. But i've been sooo ooc lately, I'm gradually losing interest. I'm sure that will be gone and I'll be addictwed to it once the weekend passes and everyone who has the time is back in school again. Funny how those thigns work out. I started a secondish RP, which I admit I am probably a bit too pre-occupied to handle. But I really want to, so I'm having an argument with myself. Yeah. I'll tell you who wins. Alright so, where was I? Okay. School. SCHOOL... SUCKS.... Okay, I am homeschooled. But let me fill you in on something. NEVER... EVER... do the online school thing. I did it have way into 8th grade. Now let me explain. I finshed that by the end of the summer, a little late because my teachers took a while to reply to my emails, and by ther time I did - I had kidna lost all will to do whatever it was. Now Im in this ritzy homeschool with books and pamplets and stuff. It's fairly tolerable. But now .. okay, it's like because the one school raelly screwed me over, I got bhehind a year because it took forever for thigns to go over right. This school year that just ended was supposed to be my Sophmore year, however I just finisehd the Freshman work on account of having been screwed over by the awful net school. So i SORT of am a year behind, not that I flunked. I'm a victum of cicumstance.. (haha... circumstance... thats a funny word) So now, I have to do my sophmore AND my Jr work in one year. Which believe me. Im so ticked offat this whole thing Ive got the drive to have it done by the end of the first semester. See, this work is a bit different. I have the same amount of studyin as a public school thing , ya know. But its less work overall. Theres about 3 - 6 ( 9 in math's case) assignments per subject per year. ANd each one is give or take 4 pages. So I'm getting on teh ball. I am freaking getting this over with. AND on top of that I am commiting myself to even go the extra mile and get 12th done. I am sick of this stupid homeschool nerd sterotype. Im a nerd yes. But that has NOTHING to do with my education plan. Yes . Because if it did, I would friggin prolly be outta college now. Thats another thing. See. Ive been asking around THis is very confusing to me. I havnt had a teacher explain it to me really. I want to go to college, okay?  And youre supposed to take the SAT or some kinda yearly high school test or something liek that. Yeah yeah. Blaaah. Okay. Now. As FAR as I know... I might take the first test for 9th (1 / 4 ???) now that that is finally settled. BUT  ...  ijust dont know for sure. I really ... really .have  no idea. Im sure its all going to play out okay. But its just frustrating you know? Well. whatever. Now I can see what my thoughts look liek and Ive decided not to laugh at this time. I'm not emo.. I'm just feeling a bit ....hungry... i guess.."

As often and as interesting as possible. I don't promise any happy 5 paragraph daily entrees. But i won't leave ya with a  boring ""I tripped over a pen cap today"". I might just use this blog as a small badnwidth thing. Or something to log stories. Or.. Who knows. Lets see how it goes. / ramble about blahg

"event","Hey Sorry I haven't updated. I am suprised of all the emails I recieved from people reading my LJ agreeing with me how adults on the internet pretty much harrass little kids for enjoyment. LOL the other day one was kicked from a chat because ""they were too young and their parents shouldn't let them online"" err...The person who said this is as mature as my 7 year old niece. Sad I know, BTW you're-a-hoe episode 4 was great! it's getting so mysterious :P"

"event","While I am not being harrassed and stalked by adults twice my age on IRC and LiveJournal (you know who you are, pedo's!), I go to school. SCHOOL ended for 10 very awesome days, but today is that tenth awesome day. I don't want it to endddddd so I tried my hardest to think that i went to school Friday, when actually i spent 9 hours with friends that day, crap! My mom bought me a cell because she wants to know where I am. HELLO! I am upstairs getting harrassed by adults twice my age on IRC and Livejournal, duh! I guess i will pretend to use it and add grandma's phone number in it. GAH!"

I'm timing NGSM acte 2 (thats NGSM not pgsm, D***) to finish because saku is waiting for it (it's so much more fun to collect data on PGSM than time anything). I gotta get that over with!"

"event","Some idiot is going around saying ""#smlive and #mishicorp are joining to make DVD subs of pgsm"" well obviously its a retarded thing because 

1. I know personally #smlive isn't interested in that

2. Mishicorp and Smlive have no connections besides the few people in both

3. Only ONE person has said this

My friend said that someone went in tv-nihon and said all this ""dekamercury"" I believe it was, and some tv-nihon people got pissed. (and no i wasn't pasted shit, only told from a view"" so stop your ""haha violating ToS"" because I know a lot of you who do -_- well thats the truth"

"event","Act Zero is finally done ripping. I want to redo act zero to get rid of the lines, because originally ""poor quality might make people buy the dvd"" was the idea, but it won't work so why not a HQ, possibly with shingetsu subs? (they do allow it) I'm just glad right now its over

Anyway I am fixing up NGSM Acte 3 script and it should be out soon"

"event","Act Zero is finally complete online. I want to thank everyone who helped in its release and it IS one of my favorite acts. But I do not recommend new fans starting with act zero, so please people, convince them to watch act 1-49 then special or zero next, doesn't really matter, zero has a lot of references people won't get until they watch it first. Thank you!"

"event","Well Act Zero goodbye's part is being finished, I've still been sick so it's hard to encode those 14 some people's crying over pgsm ending. People can try to be so mean sometimes, but its hilarious how they do it. And I am sure if other people read this, they will assume I am talking about them, its not always about you :)"

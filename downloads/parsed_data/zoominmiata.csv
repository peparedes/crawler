"event","I finally have a real weekend to enjoy, and it's my b-day on saturday as well.  I haven't had two days off in a row since I started my Tech job.  Carrie got mift at me yesterday because I tld her I had found an excellent condition  8-6 with only 50k on it (for Cheap!), owned by a little old lady none the less.   I also found an MR2 turbo and a really nice, late model 240sx.  Neither were as good of a steal as the 86 though.  Carrie said that she wants a house.  Oh well, so much for that idea  =/

I dunno what my obsession is with cars.  I really suck at working on them, but I try to anyways (I am getting better!).  I kinda did the same thing when I was first working with computer hardware.  I had some old systems, and I just kept tinkering with them until I understood everything I needed to know.  Now, a lot of people, including other techs here at work, come to me for hardware advice. Maybe when I get a regular position here at the college I can use my free class to take some automotive courses.  They have a really nice facility here at the college, and they have a dynojet =)"

"event","Ok, I have all the brochures for the 1997, 98 and 99 Eclipse and I looked up the weight for each year:

1997  3130
1998  3157
1999  3270

Uhhhhh...as far as I know, these cars should be <b>exactly</b> the same (except the '99 has white gauges).    There is a 140 lb difference between the 97 and 99 model, and that's a lot of weight when talking about a sports car.  Now I am confuzzled."

"event","I got my new Optima R51 battery for the Miata today.  Hopefuly it shoud last longer than the West Co battery.  A year and a half is not enough life for an expensive Miata battery, but hopefully I shouldn't have to worry with that anymore.  I had to buy a new J-hook at Autozone to install it (all of $2), and it was almost a perfect fit using all stock hardware, but was very snug.  It is probably 2"" taller than the original battery, and that's a lot considering there's not a whole lot of realestae in a Miatas trunk to start with.

It's been over a year (I think) since I last drove the Miata, so I took it to work today.  I forgot how scary it is to be next to a semi on the highway  =P  It needs a good warshin', I think I'll do that tomorrow morning.  Driving it today made me realize that it wil need some work to do solo comp in the SCCA next year.  A nice set of suspension should do wonders when compared to the now 14 year old suspension currently on the car.

Poor Mitsu, it needs a lot of TLC.  It will be sitting in the garage until Sunday, when I go down to Odessa to get help with replacing the belts.  Carries Uncle owns a hot rod shop down there and he has a lift that we can use. 

I got a new Best Motoring International DVD featuring the Skyline GT-R.  It's pretty spiffo and I know a whole lot more about the GT-R than I did before  =)  Also has Petter Solberg racing the WRC Subaru on their closed track, and some other goodies as well like the 2003 Tokyo auto salon.  It was well worth it."

"event","It's been a very busy few weeks.  I am making a decent dent on the work in the basement.  As soon as I buy a new sheetrock saw I can run my new Cat5e and RG6.  It'll be nice to have a professional looking network instead of the globby mess of wires I had before.

Work is going ok.  There has been weird karama since one of the supervisors died of a heart attack last week.  It's weird to see a guy perfectly fine one day, and then the next day he is in the hospital and a week later he is dead.  Makes you realize Death can come knocking at anyones door at any time he wishes.  Another sup has gone into the hospital to have a brain tumor removed.  So for most of my shifts there is no sup at all, which is kind of weird.  A lot of times we don't even see the sup anyway, unless we need help with something, so it's not like they are always watching over our shoulders (which is nice).

And on to my car, oh where should I begin.  Lets start with what I have fixed.  I replaced the oxygen sensor last week, so it is not eating as much gas as it was before.  YaY!  SO what else could be wrong?  Well here's a list:

Belts desperately need to be replaced (doing this weekend)
Clutch master cylinder (to fix shifting problems??)
Plug wires (eazzzzzzzzy as eatin' pancakes..., but still costs $$)
Funky jerking while accelerating before car is warm (possibly turbo problem?   Geeeezzz.....)
New suspension
Tires (once suspension is replaced)
Did I mention my NEW clutch is slipping (I haven't even driven it hard...)

Anyways....I like my car so I am going to try an fix these problems soon, but this thing is putting me into the poor house.  

An interesting note I recently found out is that my car weighs less than the EVO VIII and STi by over 100 lbs!

Evo VIII          3263
WRX STi         3263
Eclipse GSX    3157
VR-4              3760 (ouch!)

I thought my car was heavier, but I was wrong.  I also recently figured the front/rear weight ratio.  I don't remember the exact %; it's not too bad but not 50-50.  I think it is something I will work on once the repairs are complete.  Oh yeah, I find it odd that the EVO and STi and the exact same weight.  I smell some number subbing there."

"event","Well, lots of stuff going on and nothing at the same time.  The basement flooded over a week ago and it is still in shambles, and will be for a long time.  I lost my Mac, and some other computers as well.  I also lost most of my artwork from college.  On the positive side, the basement will be fresh and new by the time it is finished.  New paint, carpet, some funrnture, and my own personal addition, network cables run through the walls instaed of the crappy way I had it before where everything is out of order.  

The Mitsu is back from the shop and it seems to be ok, there was no frame damage.  Still needs the 60k work done though.  My friend Josh let me borrow his Japanese PS2 and his preview copy of Gran Tourismo 4...YAY!!  McLaren F1, baby.  It's my new crack and a pleasant distraction from the work I have to do in the basement.  It's only a 'Prologue', but gets an A+ in my book.  Oh, speaking of A+, I am now fully certified in A+.  Now I am working on Network+, weeeee!

So anyway, the house is trashed, dishwasher is broke, car eats gas and I am tired as hell.

That's all fine and good, but it takes about 25 min. for me to GET to work.  Amazingly enough I was only 8 minutes late which isn't enough to deduct from my paycheck =P

It's gonna be a long 10 hour shift.  I slammed down some lunch meat and a hard boiled egg for breakfast, and have already gone through my 'emergency' supply of food stuffs here, which consisted of a nutri-grain bar and a can of diet cream soda.  I even tried the pack of buttered popcorn given to me by the network guru.  It was some freebie at the last Novell convention he went to.  Lets just say that I have never had popcorn that tasted like pepper.  It was promptly filed under 'rubbish'.

Wheel of morality turn, turn, turn.  Show us the lesson that we should learn.  
And the moral of todays story is:

Never buy buttered popcorn from the lowest bidder...YUCK!"

"event","I went to the auto show on Sunday and it was well worth getting up early for.  I hadn't been for a year or two, so there were a lot of new cars I was excited to see.  My favs of the show had to be the Impreza STi, Golf R32 and Ford GT.  Other notables were the Mazdaspeed RX8, Touring 350Z (with NISMO badging) and the Saturn (yes, Saturn) ION Rally Concept.

Unsung car of the show:  Volks Golf R32.  V6-AWD-turbo.  Limited production run of 4,000 units, this is the first year it's here in the states and is unknown if it will be here next year.

One car to keep an eye on is the Mazda 3.  From what I have heard, it shares a new platform with the Volvo S20 (I think that's the #...) and a new version of the Focus.  The Mazda 3 may even be getting an AWD version, YAY!  *visions of a rally 323 GTX dancing in my head*

While I was there I snapped 118 pics, I will post some of my favs later.

ARGH... I just found on the KC region SCCA page that the high performance car control clinic is at the beginning of April.  There's no way I will have the money to be a member by then  =(  *sniff*"

<A href=""http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=dev&aid=3024"">EA to close ORIGIN Systems</A>

For those of you who know me, I had an interview with ORIGIN last year and almost a job as a level designer.  After a few other disapointments while trying to get into the game industry, I decided to do the IT thing.  Probably a better choice, now that I think about it.  The game industry seems to be getting volitle and too many companies are being consolidated into large corporations like EA.  I have seen this prolem looming on the horizon for a long time, but chose to ignore it because I wanted into the industry so bad.  Now I am glad I took a different path.

But...it sill kind of makes you wonder.  All signs pointed to me getting that job last year, and yet I didn't get it.  For a while I though it might have been me, maybe I had done something wrong in that and subsequent interviews for other jobs.  But if that were the case, it does't explain why I have excelled at such a rapid pace here at the college, all positions that I had to interview for.  Makes you wonder if there really is something that influences things.  Call it what you will...karma, the Illuminati, the force, my cat or -insert name of religion or belief here-.

"event","Wow, it's been a bit over a month since I last posted and a lot has happened since then.  First off, in the past month I have been promoted twice at work and am an honest-to-god tech for the college now (with a pager, desk, business cards and everything!); which includes a substantial pay raise.  I have a feeling this will be my ceiling for a while, at least until I get more certifications under my belt.  Speaking of which, I passed my A+ core hardware exam and am ready for the A+ OS exam next week; then on to Network+ and beyond!

I am getting married!  Yup, after 6 years to the day I finally poped the big question.  No final date yet, but probably in January of next year.

I still need to get my car repaired from the accident.  I am still ticked off about that whole situation...there is no real excuse to rear-end someone in perfect weather, it was just his lack of awareness that caused the accident.  I am stil going to the back doctor for treatment.  The only good thing to come out of the situation is that the medical bills has surpassed the pain and suffering minimum, so I will be getting a check from the other insyrance comapny once the treatment is complete.  A good chunk of it will probably be going into my car since it is in major need of the 60k servicing.  A broken timing belt is not a good thing on the 4G63 engine.

I went to the World of Wheels car show a few weeks ago and met a local guy there who races his Miata in the SCCA.  He had his Miata in the show, along with a MR2, CRX and a few others.  He invited me to come out and compete in the Solo comp.  I want to, but I still need to get the $$ for the SCCA membership fee.  The first comp is in March, so I don't think I will be able to get the $$ by then because my Miata needs a new battery on top of the membership fee....oh-well, maybe I can watch for free.  :/

I have a pseudo-new computer as well now.  A friend thought he had fried his mobo when he flashed the BIOS, so he gave it to me (along with a bunch of other parts as well).  After about five hours of work, I finally had the thing reflashed and stable.  It was no simple task though...it was very unstable, had BIOS checksum errors and sometimes didn't boot at all.  But it's all fixed and has been working flawlessly for several days now.

The neck pain is the worst.  I slept most of the day today, except for an interview I had this afternoon (BTW, I got the position).  I don't know why I have been so tired, the Doctor said I was fine (except the neck and back stuff, of course).

Yesterday I was feeling ok, so I crawled under my car to check out the damage, and it does not look too serious.  Just a new bumper, muffler and mounting hardware for the lot.  But it will need to be checked for frame damage.  It is also not aligned like it was before the accident, so hopefully nothing serious is out of whack."

"event","It was hell getting to work today.  Personally, I think the campus should have been closed, but then again, most people don't drive 25 miles to get here.  When I was on the highway (doing about 30-35 mph) I was sliding more than I was in control, but I always managed to keep it moving forward.  I don't know if my new tires were the cause or if it was really that slick.  But I made it here in one piece and I guess that's all that matters, but man was I shaking when I finally got to stop.  The campus is SO dead.  The only people I have seen are staff and even they are sparse.  I am still a bit out of it...probably from the 1 hour adrenaline rush I had from driving here.  

I found someone who should get the stoopid driver of the month award(if there were such a thing)

Ok, you've heard me rant about how bad the roads are...so I am on Hwy 435 doing about 35 mph, probably about 1-2 lanes over from the fast lane (I couldn't see the lines).  So a semi, with a trailer, barrels past me doing at least 55 mph and probably less that 2' from my car.  I could have rolled the window down and touched his truck he was so close.  Not to mention the snow and smush he threw on my car, and the mush he threw in front of my car (and on my little cleared path) which made me slide.  Stoopid-ass truck driver, get a ticket for the f'in clue bus..."

"event","One of the good things about working at a college is that when there is really bad weather, you get to stay home =)  We had a pretty nasty little winter storm last night that dumped some ice before it started snowing, so the roads are pretty bad.  I was on my way to work when I found out it was canceled, guess I should have checked beforehand but it has been a long time since I had a snow day.  That was after the hour my girlfriend and I spent trying to get her Elantra GT over the snow hump at the end of the driveway  =/

Yesterday we treated ourselves to some sushi at Jins.  Nothing like some hot miso soup, edamame and squid to make you feel all fuzzy inside  =P  He told us a funny story about a chef he met who was from california and trying to make biscuts.  He said they guy made tiny little hard biscuts and Jin said ""...you are in midwest, people want BIG, FLUUUFFY.""  He said he then showed the guy how to make a biscut and he got all pissed off because Jins were perfect  *lol*  The rest of the day was pretty well a waste, until I tried to save what was left of the pool when the storm hit.  The wind eventually poped off the top thingers I was using to support it and keep it down, so since there was nothing left to tie or use to keep it from blowing around I just gave up (I HATE giving up...).  It's still there today, so I guess the bracing that held, did it's job.

Oh well,  off to do what ever people do on snowdays!!"

"event","So...to say that my Saturday sucked is an understatement.  I had taken an extra morning shift at the lab, so I had to get up early.  Nothing wrong with that, until I stopped to get gas and noticed my front tire was really low.  Once I was done pumping gas, I drove it over to the air pump, by then it was so flat it was useless to try and fix it.  So I decide to change it to contine on to work for the day.  But the problem came in when I went to change the tire.  I have wheel locks and apparently the last mechanic to take off the wheeles BROKE my lock socket (the inner portion was completely gone).  Arhg.  So I call my grilfriend and she is on her way to pick me up.  While I am waiting, I call my road side assistance which is part of my extended contract (not through Mitsubishi).  They didn't have a lock socket for my car, nor could they find my information in their databse.  Argh II.  So my gf picks me up a few minutes later and we head to the dealership.  To make a long story short they told mt to BREAK off the wheel stud to remove the lock.  Argh III.  So we head back home and my gf has to get ready for work (she should have been there a few hours ago).  On the way to her work, I made an impression of the lock on my car (hoping the dealer could tell which lock it was).  So I wen tot he dealership next to my gf's work, and they said to BREAK off the wheel stud.  So I call my Dad (who happens to be my insurance guy).  He sid I have tow in and that will pay for the tow.  So I get back to my car and call a tow truck.  While getting the car on the truck he scraped the hell out of the bottom of the front bumper.  You can't see anything from the front, but the bottom is all scratched up now (and I am hoping there is no other damage).  Argh IV.  

SO we get to the dealership and the first master set of locks is missing the ONE socket my car uses; luckily they have a second set and are able to remove it, and they even put the doughnut on for me.  Since I drove my gf's car there I put my car in the employee parking and drive her car home.

A bit later I pick her up at work and we drive to pick up my car.  When I get out I noticed the d-nut was a bit flat.  Driving it out of the lot was enough for me to know it had a problem, so i pull into the nearest gas station.  The d-nut said it should be inflated to 60 psi, but when I checed, the psi didn't even register on my gauge.  This is probably my fault for never checking my spare, but I was hoping that was the cause and that I hadn't run over something to make my spare flat.  So we filled the tire to 60 psi and I listened for any hissing, but didn't hear any so we headed for home (SLOWLY).  My gf followed me to make sure a problem could be spotted if something happened.  My car pulls really bad and is basically not happy with the d-nut (my stock wheels are 17"").  Finally, after 12 1/2 hours since I had left home that morning, my car was back in the garage.

So I get home and head downstairs, only to find that my pet lizard has died.  She was really old for her breed and hadn't been doing too well lately, so it wasn't an extreme surprise or anything; just ironic that it added to a really bad (and frustrating) day."

I think this is about as close to having a midlife crisis at the age of 26 as you can get.  I am completely switching gears as far as my short-term career choice is concerned.  Tomorrow I am enrolling in a one year certification program.  I can get certified in an unlimited number of courses for up to one year.  I think I will do very good at this type of work, and the pay ain't half bad either (about $65-80k starting).  Here's what I should be certfied in when I am done:

A+
i-Net+
Master CIW Designer
Network+
Linux+
Security+
CCNA (Cisco)
MCSE Windows 2003

I was told that most courses take about 45 hours to complete (except the MCSE, which takes about 225).  I imagine some will take more and some will take less, since I already know a lot about hardware and OSs, but nothing about 2003 or Cisco.  They also have job placement assistance, which would almost be worth the cost alone.  Wish me luck!!

I almost have my new portfolio up and running.  About 90% of the photoshop work is done, then I just have to make image maps and rollover stuff.  It would have been much simpler to make it in Flash MX, but I think the HTML/Java is a much better method since it requires no special plug-ins.  I'll post the URL when it's ready.  Hopefully it will help me land a good job.  I've been trying to get into the game industry for so long it's getting very discouraging.  I keep applying for jobs, but I rarely hear anything back.

"event","I think I am going to scrape up the $80 and join the <A><HREF=""www.sccca.org"">SCCA</A> next year; maybe do some solo/autocross comp or road rally.  I would LOVE to do some real rally racing in the SCCA, but that takes some serious $$ to compete. Probably be around $5-10k for a safe setup that would be mildly competitive.  Then I have to find someone crazy enough to be my navigator.  Maybe some day when I am rich...

Anyways, I can't decide which car I should run if I decide to solo comp next year.  To use the Miata I am required to have a roll bar (which I don't have...), and also I think I am too tall to meet regulations for that car since the top of your helmet needs to be 1"" from the roof of your car.  I can take away a few inches by removing some padding from the seat, then I might meet the height regulation.  On the other hand, the Mitsubishi doesn't need any mods to compete, but it is my daily driver and I do not really want to push my 'going to work' car too hard.  The Mitsu is also very heavy and while it is very tossable on the street, it is a very different situation when navigating through narrow pylon courses.  But even then, the power and AWD just about make up for that.

So I paid a transfer fee, authorized the transfer and in a few days the site was on a new server.  So about two weeks ago I get an e-mail from my old domain host, saying they have automatically renewed my domain.  Eh?  Did I miss something?  I no longer wanted to do business with these people and expected a renewal notice BEFORE charging me.  They said I set it up that way, but I don't even have my cell phone bill automatically deducted from my account, why the hell would I have them auto renew anything??  So now my site was back on the old crappy servers.  SO after 2 nice e-mail and one really pissed off e-mail they have cancelled my account, but refuse to transfer my domain back to the other company.  They said '...we have done nothing wrong.'  What?  They stole business form another company and have done nothing wrong??  I want to move to that country!  So anyways, I checked with the BBB, but they are not listed (probably for obvious reasons).  So I contacted my other domain host.  They replied and said the domain is now LOCKED and I have to call the domain registrar and have them unlock the domain before it can be transferred back.  On the positive side, it sounds like the company I want to host the site will transfer it again without charging me (they have really good CS  =P)  But on the bad side, it will be next week before I can make the call.   Grrrrr......

Well, the clutch in my Eclipse is almost completely gone (from picking on too many Hondas and SUVs, I guess  ;P).  I hit high RPM (and hitting boost) while slowly accelerating on the highway (yikes!).  The boost makes it even worse, so I have to accelerate REALLY slow (to stay off the boost) or else my clutch won't grab.  Luckily, it gets replaced on Thursday with a Centerforce Dual Friction, lighted aluminum flywheel (under 9lb instead of +19!) and a braided steel clutch line from Road Race Engineering.  Aaawwwwwww, yeah....now that's the good stuff.  Now if I could only find someone who will replace the belts for less than $500  =(  I think the cost of ownership for this car is very high (as with a lot of high perofrmance cars) because I need new tires, suspension, belts, plugs and wires as well!  Surprisingly, my brakes are doing extremely well, considering how many times I have had to slam on the brakes (and whoa do they stop fast!).  Not as fast as Brembo brakes, but kudos to Mitsubishi anyways.  

I think I should make a web page for my cars...yeah, I'll post the URL here when it's done.

History: Originally, the entity known as the<br>Beyonder comprised all of the otherdimensional<br>universe, called the ""Beyond-Realm,""<br>in which he existed. The entity was entirely<br>unaware of the existence of other beings until,<br>several years ago, the atomic accident that<br>transformed laboratory worker Owen Reece into<br>the superhuman Molecule Man opened an<br>interdimensional ""pinhole"" between<br>the Beyond-Realm and the multiverse in which<br>Earth exists. Through this gap the Beyonder<br>observed the Earth for a number of years. The<br>Beyonder was fascinated, since he himself was<br>his entire reality, but each denizen of Earth<br>was but a single entity that was part of the<br>greater whole that was the multiverse. Hence,<br>each sentient being on Earth, in the Beyonder's<br>point of view was ""incomplete,"" and<br>strove to remedy its incompleteness. Hence, the<br>Beyonder believed, the driving force of the<br>minds of all sentient beings was desire; in<br>other words, wanting to have or become<br>something one is not. Indeed, now that the<br>Beyonder realized that he himself was not all<br>that existed, he saw himself as incomplete and<br>felt desire. <br><br>

To investigate the nature of desire, the Beyonder<br>undertook an experiment. Various adventurers<br>based on Earth, most of them possessing<br>superhuman powers, including the Hulk, Spider-<br>Man, and members of the Avengers, Fantastic<br>Four, and X-Men, went to New York City's<br>Central Park to investigate an enormous<br>circular construct which had materialized in<br>the park's Sheep Meadow. Entering the<br>construct, the adventurers and the construct<br>were teleported to an area of outer space near<br>a galaxy far from Earth's. Similarly, a large<br>number of costumed criminals, including the<br>Absorbing Man, Doctor Doom, Doctor Octopus, the<br>Enchantress, Kang, the Lizard, the Molecule<br>Man, Ultron, the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew,<br>as well as the planet-devourer Galactus, found<br>themselves in another construct in the same<br>area of space. Aboard the constructs the<br>passengers watched in awe as the galaxy nearest<br>to them was annihilated by an unseen force,<br>except for a single star. Then, before their<br>eyes, a planet, which became known as<br>Battleworld, was created to orbit that star.<br>Finally, a rift opened in space, from which a<br>blinding light poured, and the passengers on<br>the constructs heard a voice that told them,<br>""I am from beyond! Stay your enemies and<br>all you desire shall be yours! Nothing you<br>dream of is impossible for me to<br>accomplish!"" The passengers on the<br>constructs were then sent down to Battleworld.<br>There, over the next several days, they engaged<br>in a ""secret war"" among themselves;<br>most of the criminals sought to destroy the<br>heroic adventurers in order to gain the prize<br>that the Beyonder had promised. <br><br>

In the course of the ""secret war,"" Doctor<br>Doom used technological means to steal the<br>Beyonder's apparently unlimited power and<br>absorb it into himself. Too weakened to strike<br>back against Doom, the Beyonder secretly took<br>possession of the body of Klaw, who had been<br>resurrected on Battleworld after his seeming<br>destruction by the Dazzler. The Beyonder took<br>control of Klaw's subconscious mind and thus<br>motivated him to encourage Doom's fears of his<br>superhuman opponents in the ""secret<br>war"" and Doom's doubts over his own<br>ability to control his newly gained power. The<br>Beyonder also had Klaw persuade Doom to grant<br>him some of his new power. Then, when Doom was<br>struggling to control his power while in battle<br>with Captain America, the Beyonder left Klaw's<br>body and reclaimed his full power. The Beyonder<br>then vanished, and the participants in the<br>""secret war"" returned to the places<br>from which they had come. <br><br>

Months later, the Beyonder arrived on Earth to<br>continue his study of humanity and of desire.<br>He had never possessed a true form of his own<br>before, but now he created for himself a<br>physical form that resembled a composite of the<br>bodies of various participants in the<br>""secret war,"" in order that he could<br>walk among humanity and fulfill his desire for<br>experience in this world. Next he gave himself<br>a body identical to that of the Molecule Man.<br>To study the effects of enabling someone to<br>fulfill his fantasies, the Beyonder transformed<br>television writer Stewart Cadwall into the<br>armored Thundersword. Cadwall ran amok in his<br>new identity, and was opposed and defeated by<br>various costumed adventurers. <br><br>

Subsequently, the Beyonder gave himself a body<br>identical to that of Captain America. The<br>Beyonder encountered a number of costumed<br>adventurers, but found it difficult to<br>understand the counsel about the nature of life<br>that he received from some of them and other<br>human beings. The Beyonder then met an<br>underworld figure named Vinnie, who, seeking to<br>make use of the Beyonder's superhuman powers,<br>became his guide to the world. Under Vinnie's<br>influence the Beyonder sought wealth, pleasure,<br>and power over others. The Beyonder further<br>altered his physical appearance, giving himself<br>black, curly hair; he maintained the form he<br>now had for most of the rest of his existence<br>on Earth. <br><br>

The Beyonder finally parted company with Vinnie,<br>and used his powers to take complete control of<br>every mind, and, in fact, every atom of matter<br>on Earth. But the Beyonder found himself<br>dissatisfied: he took no pleasure in having<br>everyone serve him if they were compelled to do<br>so as if they were automatons. Hence, the<br>Beyonder released everyone and everything on<br>Earth from his control, and also wiped out<br>everyone's memories of his conquest of Earth,<br>although he allowed some people to retain a<br>vague reminiscence of it. <br><br>

The Beyonder continued to experiment with<br>experiencing love affairs with human beings. On<br>a journey to the Andromeda Galaxy to locate the<br>Avengers, he was responsible for the escape of<br>their foe Nebula. To study the effects of the<br>desire for revenge, the Beyonder transtormed<br>Thor's enemy, the Dark Elf Algrim, into the<br>powerful menace Kurse. The Beyonder also saved<br>Kathryn Twoyoungmen, then known as Talisman,<br>from entrapment in an otherdimensional world.<br>The Beyonder sought to make Alison Blaire, the<br>Dazzler, his lover, and even went so far as to<br>bestow half of his power upon her so that they<br>would be equals. However, she was not in love<br>with him, and the disappointed Beyonder, once<br>mom in possession of his full power, parted<br>from her. <br><br>

Now the Beyonder's mood began too change. He found<br>desire a nuisance, and wondered whether he<br>should continue to study it or just return to<br>the Beyond-Realm, where he would feel complete<br>unto himself. He briefly had the young<br>superhuman mutant called Boom-Boom as a<br>companion, and terrified her when he threatened<br>to destroy the entire universe on a whim. She<br>alerted the Avengers to his threat, and they in<br>turn informed other superhuman champions.<br><br><br>

Deciding he could not simply return to the Beyond-<br>Realm and forget he had ever experienced<br>desire, the Beyonder remained on Earth, but<br>fell into despair. The sorcerer Doctor Strange<br>advised him to find a purpose in life, and so<br>the Beyonder decided to become a champion of<br>life like Strange himself. He acted as a<br>""super hero"" both on Earth and on<br>other planets, but still seemed uncertain of<br>his role in the universe, especially after<br>Captain America and Mister Fantastic advised<br>him of their fears that humanity would become<br>overly dependent on the Beyonder to solve their<br>problems for them. Encouraged by his aide, a<br>journalist named Dave, the Beyonder overcame<br>his own doubts. The Beyonder then obliterated<br>Death itself from the universe, thus earning<br>the wrath of Mephisto, the satanic ruler of an<br>otherdimensional realm of the dead. The<br>Molecule Man, however, convinced the Beyonder<br>that existence was meaningless without death,<br>and so the Beyonder brought Death back into<br>existence by using his power to kill the<br>reporter Dave, who willingly sacrificed his<br>life. <br><br>

The Beyonder went to a South Seas island to<br>contemplate. There an army of superhuman<br>criminals assembled by Mephisto attacked him,<br>but he was saved by the. Inspired by the<br>Thing's heroism, the Beyonder decided to<br>inspire others in turn to find their true role<br>in life. But, again, the Beyonder used his<br>powers to control the minds of others to do so.<br>After the Puma failed to kill him, the Beyonder<br>became convinced that he was wasting his time<br>in trying to enlighten others. <br><br>

Furious, the Beyonder now believed he had no role<br>in the universe, and decided he would be<br>happier if he destroyed the multiverse so he<br>would be alone once more. He slaughtered most<br>of the New Mutants and did battle with the<br>Avengers and Rachel Summers, alias Phoenix.<br><br><br>

Finally, many of Earth's costumed champions joined<br>forces to stop the Beyonder once and for all,<br>lest he obliterate the multiverse. In an<br>underground sanctum deep beneath the Colorado<br>Rocky Mountains, the Beyonder decided that<br>perhaps he would find the contentment he sought<br>if he became a mortal being. The Beyonder<br>created a vast machine to bring about the<br>transformation, and tested it by resurrecting<br>the New Mutants he had killed. The Beyonder<br>then used the machine to turn himself into a<br>mortal being with no superhuman powers, but was<br>then confronted by the vengeful Mephisto. The<br>Beyonder then reclaimed his tremendous power<br>and immortality, and decided, in order to<br>protect himself from his foes; he would use the<br>machine to transform himself into a mortal<br>being who still retained his full power. The<br>Molecule Man and the assembled costumed heroes<br>attacked the Beyonder in his sanctum, but, the<br>Beyonder defeated them all. Then the Beyonder<br>entered the machine once more, and was<br>transformed into a mortal infant into whom the<br>machine began feeding the Beyonder's vast<br>power. The machine would soon rapidly age the<br>infant into an adult and release him. Believing<br>he must take what he thought might be the only<br>chance to save the multiverse from someday<br>being destroyed by the Beyonder, the Molecule<br>Man destroyed the machine, killing the infant<br>within, The machine's destruction unleashed the<br>Beyonder's titanic energy, which the Molecule<br>Man projected into another dimension. There the<br>Beyonder's energy caused the creation of a new<br>universe. <br><br>

Strength Level: The Beyonder's strength in the<br>human form described under Physical<br>Characteristics was potentially unlimited.<br><br><br>

Known Superhuman Powers: The Beyonder was<br>apparently the most powerful being ever to<br>exist in this universe (although he was not<br>native to this universe), and hence could do<br>virtually anything, The Beyonder could<br>manipulate incalculable amounts of energy and<br>create and rearrange matter on a planetary<br>scale. He proved capable of obliterating an<br>entire galaxy.<br><br><font face=""Georgia""<br>size=""+1"">

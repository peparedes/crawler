"event","Listen... If ONE more BAD thing happens to me this week, I SWEAR that I'm gonna dig a hole and jump right into it.  Actually, I dont think that I could take being dirty, so maybe I'll just lock myself in my room for a month or so.  My therapy will consist of nothing but Jo... Think it'll work?  Probably so... Jo always works!

Ok... so your probably wondering 'Oh Lord, after the whole plane incidentS - what else could have happened?' ~ Well, I'll tell you!  Wait... it gets 'better'!

Thursday, my friend Nikki came to visit me here in Louisiana, which is awesome, cause I know how bad she's been wanting to come, and I wanted her to come too.  So her plane landed at 3:00 p.m. or a little after, and I didnt even get off work until 3:30.  So I'm already feeling bad that she had to sit and wait at the airport while I tried my hardest to get there in record time.  Well firstly, I got stuck in traffic (for construction on the interstate) for about five minutes (which wasnt so bad, considering... but that was five minutes that I could have gotten there faster) ~ THEN I had to stop for gas cause when I left home I didnt realize that I was so low on fuel, so that took a little while too.  So finally I get to the airport at about 5:30 and I cant figure out how the hell to get into the parking lot because there are road blocks up at all the entrances! So I had to circle the damn thing about three times, then I finally asked a cop how to get in and he informed me that I had to go into the 'long term parking' lot.  So I went and parked, then IN HEALED BOOTS did a little jog across the parking lot toward the airport entrance.  So there is poor Nikki just chillin out with her feet all propped up on her luggage lol.  Before we could leave I had to make a trip to the ladies' room.  Finally we were on our way and I was gonna bring Nikki to McDonalds to get something to eat cause all she'd had all day was some prezels... how about make me feel worse why dont ya! LOL JK ~ So I'm driving along, and the traffic is pretty heavy.  I'm on a three-lane street in the left lane and I needed to get into the middle lane.  So I check my mirrors and then twist my head around JUST to make sure, cause my daddy always taught me NEVER to JUST rely on your mirrors.  So I see that nothing is coming, then Nikki looks too, and she's like ""You can go"" ~ So... I went... ~ Well... I'm like HALF WAY into the lane... and BAM! My passenger-side door comes in contact with the tire and front bumper of a semi!!!!!! I WAS HIT! Or... I hit something... whatever... IT WAS SO CRAZY! THAT FUCKER JUST CAME OUT OT NOWHERE!!!! I SWEAR!

Well naturally I start freaking out, because I wasnt even IN MY CAR. I was in Dette's car (Mandy's mom) ~ So I hurry and pull off of the road into this little parking lot thingy not far from a Burger King.  So the fucking black guy in the truck is like hanging out the window looking at me and he kinda puts up his hand like 'Wait, I'm coming back' - While all this is going on I'm FREAKING out. I was just looking at the car and screaming 'OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! THIS IS SO BAD! THIS IS SOOO SOOO BAD! I'M IN SUCH BIG TROUBLE! THIS IS SO BAD!' - I had to ask Nikki to use her phone cause mine was out of airtime (I suck... I know...) So I'm calling at my house a billion times but NOBODY will fucking pick up, and I know it's because somebody is on the phone because we have an answering machine that picks up after four rings, and the phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing. Finally the fucker in the truck pulls up on the side of the parking lot that I was in (cause there was no way he was getting that thing into that little parking lot, then back out again) So he gets out of his truck, comes over to me (I'm still on the phone trying to get someone to pick up) and DOESNT ASK 'are you ok'... he says 'Did you call the cops yet?' So I look at him like he's fucking stupid and say 'No!' ~ So he goes to get on his phone and call his company then call the cops and I'm still trying to get in touch with SOMEBODY.  Then the fucker is all looking at his front bumper to make sure there is no damage... ON A FUCKING SEMI!!! Finally Dette picks up the phone and I tell her 'I just got hit by a big truck' ~ Naturally she freaks out, asks if we're ok and stuff, and I'm not even caring if we're ok, I'm more concerned about the car cause IT'S HERS! She's like ""It's just  car, all I care about is that your ok and your friend is ok"" But I still felt horrible. All I could say over and over was ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry"" and just CRY.   Then a cop shows up, asks questions, dah dah dah, I had to FIND Dette's registry and insurance card, which took a little while cause I've never had to use them before... then the cop tended to the black guy first and let him go, and I was freaking out cause I KNEW that I wasnt on Dette's insurance, and I thought that I was so going to jail... I was just waiting for him to cuff me and stick me in the back of his car.  He filled out alot of paper work and asked me alot of questions for the forms and then gave me a ticket for careless driving because apparently... the fucking truck was 'in my blind spot...'... HOW IS A FUCKING SEMI IN YOUR BLIND SPOT!?? ~ There is no way that he was already in that fucking middle lane... He HAD to be in the right lane and we BOTH had to be getting into the middle lane at the same time! There is no other explaination! Un-fucking-believable... Why is everything happening to me?

Well... I guess for my first wreck it wasnt so bad... coulda been worse, ya know.  At least I didnt end up in the hospital, or jail.  The cop was actually nice too. He said ""It was just an accident, dont beat yourself up about it"" - Oh crap, that reminds me, I have to call the fucking court house. I dont want to... I dont wanna go to court... This is so fucked...

"event","In all tragicness, I traveled all the way from Louisiana, up to Wisconsin to stay with Jessica (Jess) - I was late to the airport on Friday morning when I was supposed to get ON my plane BY 6:00 a.m. - I didnt arive at the airport until 6:15 (or so) because I took the WRONG exit and went down about 10 minutes IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!  I didn't end up getting to Wisconsin until almost 5:00 p.m. (opposed to the actual time I was supposed to get there *12:20 p.m.*) I had 2 hour layovers between every flight... which actually wasnt so bad, cause I had a good book to read at least ~ Once I finally did get there, Jess took me to her house, which was like nothing I'd ever seen before (cause the kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a livingroom were upstairs, and a living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a laundry room were downstairs, it was really cool lol) ~ After I dropped off all my crap, Jess rounded up some friends and we went to 'NIGHTMARE' ~ which is kinda like a religious thing... ok MORE than kind of. It's like this warehouse where they put together these 'skits' that are like real life situations, like domestic violence, suicide, drugs, car crashes, pergitory, hell, and then at the end Jesus dying on the cross ~ So Friday night was 'eventful'

Saturday was filled with shopping, and sign making, but I'm not like a hundred percent on what the hell else happened LOL we were kinda on the go alot, and I got to see her parents' bar that they just bought and are fixing up. It's nice ~ I wish my parents would have bought a bar! lol We didnt end up going to sleep until after midnit, so we only got like 6 hours of sleep!

Sunday.... me and Jess were up at 6:00 a.m., both getting ready and all that good junk.  We were on the road by 8:00 or so... maybe 9:00... We got lost a few times, and had to drive through DOWNTOWN CHICAGO!!! Took pics of the city, and I was like ""Oh my God, I'm in Chicago!"" LOL  ~ When we finally DID get to Joliet, we found the theatre, then we went to track down a store that was open on a Sunday that actually sold flowers! ~ We did find a place, and got Jo two different kinds... pink roses, and purple ""crazy dazies"" ~ It was cool, and I had this little teddy bear that was white, with purple wings, and a yellow and pink striped belly, and the arms velcrowed, so we put the bear's arms around the purple crazy dazies and wrote a little note that said ""would you be my wings"" so we could give it to her while she sang that song, BUT SHE DIDNT SING IT!!! SAAAD! 

Once they finally opened the doors to the theatre we went to the box office and Jess asked for the tickets, so I gave them to her, and she asked the woman at the box office something about them... where the seats were or something... and come to find out... THE STUPID PEOPLE AT TICKETMASTER SENT ME THE WRONG TICKETS!!! or just flat out LIED about where they were! I was TOLD that I had 2 seats ON THE FLOOR in the seventh row! Well... come to find out... they were IN THE BACONY in the seventh row... but it actually wasnt so bad, cause the place was pretty small... So I sucked it up and got over it and enjoyed it.

Meet and Greet: 

When I finally got into the dressing room where Jo was holding the meet and greet, my ARMS were about to FALL OFF cause the bag with the big jar of dubble bubble WAS HEAVY, plus I was holding 'Stevie' *my huge steve madden jacket*, and my JDM quilt.  So I'm like DRAGGING the bag on the floor, and Jo looks at me funny, so I put it down in front of her and she is like ""You guys have alot of stuff"" and Jess says ""Yea, most of its for you!"" and then Jo was like ""Well I hope it's nothing edible."" and we kinda laughed, then she looked at me and asked ""Do you want me to open it now, or later?"" So I was like ""Uuummm.. now!"" so she picks it up and puts it on the little table and opens it up and she's like ""Oh my dentist is going to love you"" and I laughed; I was like ""You told me that last time..."" she goes ""OH!"" like she remembered some crazy girl giving her a big jar of dubble bubble once before, and then she says ""You have no idea how many caps I've had to get since the last time I saw you!"" I was like ""oops"" - Then she pulled out the 'Miss B. Haven' shirt from American Eagle that I bought her, and she like unfolded it and read it, then she laughed, she was like ""Ha! Miss B. Haven... I love that!"" I was like ""You really like it?"" she goes ""Yea!"" and laughed again. So then I gave her my quilt, and I was like ""Um... could you sign 'I'm just downloding these clothes'?"" and she looked at me really weird, and she was like "" 'I'm just downloading these clothes'? What does that mean?"" LOL I was like ""You said it at the fan club party"" so she's still looking at me weird, she's like ""I did??"", I was like ""Uh huh"" and Jess says ""You were making fun of Wynona Rider"", so Jo kinda laughs and says ""Oh shh**t"" LOL And I wanted to laugh really bad... So she signs 'I'm just downloading these clothes' and the whole time she's like ""Iiii'mmm... juuuuusssttt... downloading?? (and she looked up at me to make sure, and I was like 'yea') doooowwnnlllooooaaaadddiiinngg... thheeeessseeee... cloooothheeess."" LOL - Then I took my M&G pic with her, and I like kinda tripped over my pants cause they were too long... sad stories... so I just kinda leaned into her and then pulled myself back up straight really fast, and so I kinda wasnt ready when the picture was taken... bah... Then with my second camera I let Jess get in with me, and they were kinda like rushing us... lol which was understandable LOL After we took the picture together we left the room and went to find our seats.  The opener was Rachel Proctor, but I didnt get to see her cause she was on while I was standing in the M&G line.  While walking to our seats I realized that Jo had also put 'BUY the record' with 'buy' underlined - as an emphasis! LOL SHE'S SO F-IN CUTE!

The show was good, and Jo was really cute and funny. She sounded really good despite the fact that she was sick.  I'll try to remeber all the funny stuff that she said/did... ok here goes:
I'm not like a hundred percent on the song list IN ORDER exactly, but these are the songs I REMEMBER ~ Dare To Dream, I'm Alright, Lesson In Leavin, Bye Bye (and we did the contest... I think the girls won... lol), That's The Way, I Wish, Because You Love Me, Get Up And Dance, Don't Stop Believing, Bring On The Rain... I don't remember if she did Downtime... Anything is possible lol.  Sadly the show only lasted a little over an hour, and there was an intermission where this little girl came on and did two songs (I could not ask for more, and Burn) - The little girl was very good. I forgot what her name was... bah

Funny stuff:

Ok, like she's walking around the stage and talking and stuff... not uncommon... and she sees this woman with a cell phone, and she's like ""Oh God! With the phones!"" so she makes a face like 'why are you on the phone in the middle of my show?' then she's like ""Give me that!"" so she reaches out and the woman gets up and gives her the phone. So Jo is standing there staring at it, and she starts counting down the minutes... ""four-thirty-four... four-thirty-five... four-thirty-six... four-thirty-seven... four-thirty-eight..."" then she laughs and then she puts the phone to her ear and says ""Can you hear me now?"" LMAO!!! so then she asks ""Who is this?"" and I *think* his name was Bryan... but even if it wasnt - leats just say it WAS. So the guy says ""Bryan"" so Jo says ""Hey Bryan, what are you doing?"" then she says ""Lets see if this works?"" and puts the ear piece to the mic and the guy says ""I'm just sitting at home watching TV"" so Jo says ""Why arent you here?"" and everybody laughs LOL (SHE'S SO CUTE!!) so the guy said something.. i dont know what, everybody was laughing so I didnt really hear. Then Jo asks ""What are you watching?"" and he says some game... so Jo is like ""Well what's the score?"" and he says something... but once again everybody was laughing at Jo so i didnt catch what he said. IT WAS SO FUNNY!!!

When Jo did That's The Way, confetti shot out when she said 'Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin' '  ~ After the song was over, she was walking around and talking to Johnny, and then I guess somebody up front was laughing, so she was like looking at the back of her pants, and she said ""What? What's going on? Do I have toilet paper on my shoe?... Listen I know these pants have holes in them... what's going on!?"" then she gave up on trying to find out exactly what WAS so funny, then she says ""You know how when you go to the bathroom and you get toilet paper stuck on your shoe... you want someone to tell you right?"" everybody says 'yea!' so she's like ""ok, just making sure..."" then she points to somebody close to the stage and she's like ""I just wanted to let you know you have some confetti in your hair..."" then she laughs, and everybody laughs, then she's like ""but now that I'm looking around, everybody has confetti in their hair!"" and laughs again.

At some point she was telling a story about getting a letter right after she finished her workout at like... ""The World Gym"" or something like that, and alot of people cheered at the mention of it lol, then she was like ""Yea, so *somebody (I forgot who she said)* gave me the letter, and I handed it to my trainer and I said 'Here, you open it' cause I was so tired"" then she went on to explain that it was this really sweet letter from this woman who wanted to tell her about her husband, who had bought her tickets to see Jo's show, although it was on HIS birthday, and Jo pulls out the letter, and she's like ""Cough once if I can read this out loud"" so the woman coughs twice LOL, then Jo is like ""Well I'll just read parts of it, because it's kinda personal, and it's really sweet... ok here goes..."" so she reads bits and pieces of it, and the woman asked her in the letter if she would either sing her husband 'Happy Birthday' or 'Because You Love Me' - so Jo read the letter and then she was like ""So-and-so, I want to meet you"" so he went up to the stage and she got down on her knees and hugged him and it was really sweet, then she was like ""You smell really good! Your gonna have to send me some of that cologne!"" LOL so she went back to her mic and sang 'Because You Love Me'

Then she told this joke *LMAO* - She kinda intro-ed it, something like ""My band hates me because I always ask them to tell me jokes, but they have to be clean. So the other day *so-and-so (dont remember who she said)* told me a joke, and it goes like this... This guy walks into a bar and says 'OUCH!'... ya get it?? He WALKS into a bar! (and she smacked her forehead with her hand) LOL It was so corny! LOL it made it really funny that SHE thought it was funny LOL.

After that joke, she was standing there trying to think of what else to say cause she wanted to tell more stories, so she's like ""I thought of this other story, but I forgot..."" LOL and THAT is so WEIRD, because I JUST bought this keychain that says 'I just thought of something, but I forgot' !!

Then toward the end of the show, me and Jess yelled out 'WE LOVE YOU JO DEE!' and Jo was like 'Aw thanks, I love you too' then some other girls to the right of us were like 'WE LOVE YOU TOO JO DEE!' so she was like 'I love you too' and giggled, so me and Jess were like 'WE LOVE YOU MORE!!' and Jo laughed then said 'Alright well when you guys are finished with the contest over who loves me more let me know' LOL SO F-IN CUTE!! AH! I LOVE HER!! MORE!! LOL

AND I CANT BELIEVE JO SAID 'GOOBER' !!!! AH! That was the most funny/ironic thing i've ever heard her say. I say it all the time LOL. She's walking around and talking... duh... And says something like; 'Yea, usually I do something really stupid which gets me the 'goober of the day award' but today... today somebody else got it. Then proceeds to tell us about this crew guy who said something really stupid. It was hilarious because the guy who got the 'goober of the day award' was talking to her after she was doing a little rehearsal (singing Burn) and he asks ""Hey... did you do that song?"" and she's like ""Um... yea... I had an album named after it and everything!"" LOL

OH MY GOD!! then she was about to do ""Where were you"" and she was doing a little intro for it, and telling that story she ALWAYS tells about how for two days NOBODY called her. Anyway, and the story went something like... ""Yea, usually my friends were always like 'Paaaartyyy at Jo Deee's hooouuusee!' but then when I was going through this tough time it was like nobody was there, and my phone didnt ring for two days..."" SO SAD!!! Everybody was like ""aww.."" - But the 'party at Jo Dee's house' thing was funny.

That's kinda all I remember right now... I'll update more as I remember.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


Monday was TRAGIC! in all the thirty-year-old-ways!! ~ I was up and to the airport an hour before my plane was scheduled to leave at 11:00 ~ Well... it had started to rain in the early morning hours, and because it was so COLD... the rain turned INTO SNOW! which I thought was AWESOME at first, because I havent seen snow since I was VERY little. When I got to the airport I learned that my flight was canceled due to the weather! AAAHH!! So I had to wait until 4 p.m. to fly out, and I wouldnt get to Lafayette until 11:00 p.m. - So that was all fine and dandy, after I had a good cry in the airport, I sucked it up, and Jess and I went back to her house and watched Jo on Touched By An Angel, and The Wayne Brady Show (TEARS!!) We also cooked a pizza that I only ate one slice of cause I wasnt really that hungry at the time.  Well, so I flew from Wausau to Miniapolis, and from Miniapolis to Memphis... but in Miniapolis, the stupid pilot waited for about 15 minutes extra for like 5 stupid people who were on a delayed plane who were supposed to be on mine to Memphis... well I get to Memphis and RUN as hard as I can to my gate, which is like SO far away... give my ticket to the people and they're like ""Sorry, this plane already left""... I was like ""what!?"" I like got hysterical, I started to cry ... It was SO horrible. I almost stopped breathing. So I had to go to the ticket counter to see if I could get another flight out, and the woman said there were no more going out last night... I started to cry even harder. She told me that she already put me on the 8:35 flight out, and that I had to stay over night... the airport paid for a hotel room at the Radison. I thought I was going to have to stay IN the airport... so I was really sad until the told me that I could go to the hotel and they would pay for it. So I called home and told Mandy and Dette and Jamie (who were already in Lafayette waiting for me to get there) that I wouldnt be in until the next morning. I cried so much... I was a wreck... all I wanted to do was go home! 

Finally I got to Lafayette at like 10:30 yesterday morning, then went to eat, cause I was starving, then came home YAY! slept for a good while, cause I was exhausted from getting hardly any sleep all weekend LOL.

And.. that's the story of...

"event","Well... good news.  My first day on the job was EXCELLENT!

Thank GOD that I got to start with Mandy.  She trained me a little, which was all the training I needed cause I already basically knew everything about the 'plan-o-gram' and merchandise.  I was like a little tazmanian devil in there LOL I was actually having fun! When it was time to leave I was like ""aw, sad"" lol I actually wanted to stay and finish what I was doing... which I DID! I stayed like 10 minutes extra to finish the bin I was working on.  I'm such a profectionist... which is WEIRD cause I HATE HATE HATE cleaing my room! LOL  

I'm not like a hundred percent sure that working at Claire's is such a good idea... because of the fact that ALL I do is put out shipment (since the store got remodeled and expanded, they actually NEED someone to JUST put out shipment) I get to see ALL of the merchandise... SO I WANT TO BUY ALL OF IT!! AAAHH!! ~ Today, I bought two necklaces.  One is a silver butterfly, and it's kinda big... it's a choker. The other matches the shirt that I'm gonna be wearing for the Jo show, so YAYNESS! I HAD TO HAVE THEM!!  I also got two keychains ~ so cute! ~

Keychain 1: ""HA HA HA! I Don't Get It""
Keychain 2: ""I may not be perfect BUT I'm so close it's scary""
Keychain 3: ""I thought of something, but I forgot""

LMAO!! ARE THOSE TOTALLY ME OR WHAT!!?? *giggles uncontrollably*

After I left the store, I went and got a subway sandwich then booked it to the JC Penny Salon so I could get my 'hur' did.  It had been SO long since I'd gotten my hair done all the way around my head that I actually had NO regrowth on the bottom because it had grown out and been cut off LOL. It was pretty tragic.  It took about... 3 hours to do everything.  I also decided WHILE in the chair that I DEFINITELY wanted some 'long bangs' cut in... so Delicia cut some, and I'm happy to report that I LIKE EM! ~ PRAY for me that my Meet and Greet pic comes out purdy! ~

It's offically 5 days til my Jo show (not counting today)
I'm like so excited, I dont even know what to do with myself!
I will only be home for two more days and then I'm gonna be like 'BYE BYE LOVE I'LL CATCH YA LATER!' LOL

Tomorrow I have like NOTHING to do, cause I dont have to go back to work until after I come back from Wisonsin/Illinois, so *tomorrow* will be my 'me' day. FUN!  I have to go pick up some extra money though from my dad, and I dont know if that'll be tomorrow, or another day... it'll probably HAVE to be tomorrow though, cause I have no idea when else I'll be able to go! Such hecticness after tomorrow.

Thursday (because of Football game scheduling conflicts) the city of Iowa (where i live) is going to having the Trick Or Treating going on, because the football game is on Friday (Halloween) ~ I think this is STUPID... It's like, JUST cause of a stupid football game they think they can CHANGE a freakin holiday... what would they do if there was a scheduled football game on Christmas!? WOULD THEY HAVE CHRISTMAS THE DAY AFTER!?!?!? ~ enough about that, I dont want to talk about it... I'm gonna have to nap Thursday, because I've decided that I CANT GO TO SLEEP on Thursday night, cause theres NO WAY I'll be able to wake up at 3:30 in the morning to shower and stuff so I can get to the airport in Lafayette (an hour away) to be on my plane for 6:00.  I'm just not good at waking up early like I used to be.  I've gotten out of the school cycle, so I know for a fact that if I dont stay up through the night I will MISS my plane! Which would be bad!  ~  I can snooze on the way in the car if I need to, but I'll have my trusty energy pills to keep me awake for the rest of the day.

I'm also excited about the Valdosta show! *crosses fingers that we get good seats!* hehe *waves to Krissie Poo*

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

In other news, one of my best friends (not giving any names, if you know then you know) had something really good happen to her.
My friend - I'll call her Apple Dumplin' - got a good surprise from HER best friend the other day - Who I'll call Banana Split - see... Banana Split had kind of thrown away their bestfriend-relationship over something that I'm not afraid to say was 'rediculous' ~ But Banana Split realized her mistake and told Apple Dumplin' that she wanted to be friends again.

From the beginning I told Apple Dumplin' that Banana Split just needed time, and that she'd come around and realize that she was throwing away something really important and that evetually after the initial anger wore off, she'd know that the friendship was worth more than any silly disagreement, and that she'd regret throwing it away.  Needless to say, I was right.  And I couldnt be happier for Apple Dumplin' ~ honestly

Jamie cooked gumbo, which I've been waiting for since LAST winter!  She makes (and I'm not exaggerating) THE best gumbo!  Some of you may not even know what the fuck gumbo tastes like, but let me tell ya.. your missing out!

All of us sat at the kitchen table, ""as a family"" ~ which is something we NEVER do.  We talked about silly things as usual, and I almost spit out my food a few times because I was laughing so hard.  When everyone was finished eating... and I mean SO finished that we couldnt MOVE cause our bellies were so full.. we stayed at that table and played a game.  We went around stating all of our favorites, kinda like a survey.. ya know, favorite actor, singer, song, band, movie, etc.  It was kinda funny, cause Jamie was calling out our names as it was our turn to answer whatever happened to be the topic of 'fav', and when it got to 'singer' she totally skipped me, and I was like ""HEY!"" and she goes ""Well we dont need you to tell us, we already know it's Jo Dee."" LOL I was like ""yea, true.. ok go ahead.""
Fun times...

Anyway, today I found out that I DONT start my job at Claire's NEXT week.. I START TOMORROW!! OH MY GOD!!! I'M SO UNPREPARED!! LOL It's ok, I'll live lol.  I'm kinda excited.  Tonight I have to take some kind of phone test.  Weird... it asks you questions like ""Have you ever stolen anything?"" LOL and you have to answer honestly... Mandy told me that some people actually FAIL this test ~ FUNNY!!!

In other news, It's exactly 6 days (not counting today) until my Jo Show, and I'm SOOOO excited! I'm like so excited I dont know what to do with myself!

I also found out today that I may be moving.  That's kinda scary.  Baton Rouge is far.  I dont want to leave my home, but it might be kinda fun.  Sorta scary... I dunno, I could get used to it.  I got used to living here away from my parents, so I guess this will just be one more big step that I'll have to take in becoming an adult... whatever that means lol.  I'm really doing it for Mandy, cause she got offered a job in Baton Rouge for a management position.  Her company wants to promote her, so thats 'yayness' ~ sucks though, cause if we do end up leaving I'll have to find another job... and I JUST got this one.  Crap... Crap in my Cinnamon Toast Crunch! I would stay here, but I dont want her to have to go alone. She'd have like NO one... well I mean her brother lives there, but he's always doing SOMETHING. Plus I think Baton Rouge is kinda exciting, I like to visit... I dont know what it would be like to live there.  I'm a city person though.  I dont ENJOY the country like most southerners do.  Green Acres is NOT the place for me lol  
If I did move, I probably couldnt afford the internet... then again I probably could, as long as I never buy ANYTHING else... that would suck... hmm *ponders* 'internet... necessities... internet... food... internet...... duh internet!' LMAO Ok no for real though LOL. Aw, I dont want to say goodbye to all my friends... Krissie... what am I gonna do without you?  Your my little Krissie Poo!  Nikki... Your the worst member EVER and if I never talk to you again how can I call you a 'bad member'!? ... then there's Heather, my little Puddin' Lump *sad face*, and Tiff ~ who gave me the nick name ""Kinnki"" (Typo that sounds like Kinky)... WHO DOES THAT!?, and Kirkie! and Coley, and Holly, and Matt, and Ash, and Jess and Jessica! and... aw sad!!!!!!!!

Now I'm depressed...


But that's really all I have to talk about... So now I cant even make myself happy again... oh wait JO SHOW IN SIX DAYS!!! WHEEEW!!


Until Next Time
Lotsa Love

"event","If there was one thing I'd change about the world, it would be to make people less opinionated.

Your probably sitting at your computer asking ""Why?"" ~ Well... I'll tell ya.

I was having this conversation with this person that I NEVER talk to, and I think from now on I'll leave it that way.  So we're chatting it up, and I told the person that I was going to see Jo in 12 days, which is totally great.  I'm also going to see Jo in... 5 weeks and some days YAY! ~ But wait, I'm still distraught!

NOW LET ME TELL YOU WHY! 

Ok... So me and this person are talking about the Jo show, and the chat went something like:
Person: ""Are you going to the meet and greet?"" 
Me: ""Yep"" 
Person: ""Will ya do me a favor?""  
Me: ""I'm giving her another jar of dubble bubble."" 
Me: ""Sure I will."" 
Person: ""First, I wouldnt give her dubble bubble, second, will you tell her I said hi?""
Me: ""Why wouldnt you give her dubble bubble? I'll tell her you said hi.""
Person: ""I'm not really at liberty to say.""
Me: ""Sure you are, if it's bad to give her dubble bubble I should at least know why I cant give it to her.""
Person: ""Well, a girl can only have so much dubble bubble.""


*Ahem* What kinda fuckin shit is that!? 

I already have the big jar of dubble bubble... I'm not gonna NOT give it to her.  But it still saddens me that the person would say that... who can get enough of dubble bubble? I mean REALLY!?

Ok, I'm finished now... I'm gonna go to bed and get over it, I'll be fine tomorrow... I think...

Hey Everybahdey,

~I've come to the conclusion that ~*TODAY*~ is an Offical Happy Day~

I know the reason I feel so happy is cause I took an energy/anti-depressant earlier this morning, but I dont really CARE why I'm so happy LOL that's not the point... The point is I'M HAPPY! so be happy with me Okay!?

Another reason today is an Offical Happy Day is because TODAY is the TWO WEEK MARKER for my Jo Show in Joliet (Illinois) ~  YAAAAY!!! Oh my God, I am so excited I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF!! *Falls on the floor ~ giggling uncontrollably*

I've already got a sort of layed out ""weekend plan"" that Jessica filled me in on, so this is basically all the stuff we're gonna have to cram in to the weekend lol.

Friday ~ (I'll arrive in Wisconsin at around 12:00 or a little after) ~ When Jess picks me up from the airport, I'm gonna ""throw all my shit in her car"" (which was actually a statement directly taken from a conversation that we had lol) then go to this radio station where she actually knows this chick who actually knows Johanna (Jo's assistant!) ~ No I'm not bragging... I'm just tellin' ya... but if I DID want to brag I'd be like... ""Hey... I know a girl, who knows a DJ, who is friends with Jo's personal assistant... so it's almost like Jo and I are related..."" LMAO!!! ok NOT QUITE related... but hey, it could happen LOL.  *~*~* ANYWAY! after the radio station we're going to a few other places... and then Trick Or Treating!! 

I haven't been TRICK OR TREATING since FOREVER! ~ But going Trick or Treating means LOTS OF CANDY TO EAT ON THE WAY (4-5 HOURS) FROM JESS'S HOUSE TO THE RIALTO SQUARE THEATRE!! FUN TIMES! I've decided to dress as The Jo Dee Messina Fairy!... gimme a break, I'm not going out to buy a witch costume lol.  I'm gonna wear a long sleeve shirt with a Jo Dee tank top over it, and my fairy/butterfly wings that I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO HAVE cause I'm obsessed with the little creatures lol. ~ But I'm thinking that my costume needs a more catcy title... anybody have any ideas?? lol.

Saturday ~ Shopping... lots of shopping and other crazy things which include making our own Jo t-shirts, fun! ~Seven days without Jo Dee makes one weAk~ lol

Sunday ~ THE JO SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



OH MY GOD! listen to this tragic story lol, the other day ... I think it was Wednesday that Mandy had her surgery... yea! Wednesday, me and Mandy and Brandon had to stay in Lafayette (which is a town about an hour away from here) in a hotel cause Mandy had to go back the next day after her surgery to the hospital to make sure everything was all good. ANYWAY, so it's Wednesday night, and I'm laying in the bed watching TV, and I'm like SO bored, and I dont know what made me think about it, but I was like ""Where are my Jo show tickets?"" so I hop out of the bed and run over to my purse and look in it, and they're not in there, so I'm like ""SHIT!"" so I sit on the bed and think for a minute. Then I remember that I had put them on my dresser at some point in time. But the bad thing about THAT was... the other day I cleaned my room like SPOTLESS... I mean I found things in there that I didnt know I had... like corners... floor.. LOL (I had entirely too many clothes, and I actually gave away like 6 or 7 trashbags FULL to Goodwill after my cleaning) so I'm trying to remember all the stuff I threw away off my dresser, and I remember alot of envelopes (which the tickets were in an envelope) and I was like ""oh my god, I threw the tickets away"" - then I was like ""no wait... maybe I put them in my Tinkerbell purse"" so I had to wait until like 3:00 the next day (Thursday) to GO home and look in my Tink purse to see if they were in there... which they were, thank GOD. But can you imagine my frustration of not being able to just walk into my room and see if they were in there for that many hours lol, I was getting SO nervous/scared. I didnt know what to do with myself lol.

Tragic huh!? Yea I know.  Anyway... so that's my story...

Right now I'm multi-tasking (talking to people, updating this jourlan, and downloading/looking through songs I already have downloaded *so I can make CDs for my trip) ~ It's craziness, I feel like I cant do enough things to keep myself occupied LOL 

I cant believe I haven't updated this thing in so long LOL... my bad, my bad, you forgive me though right?

"event","~*Weddings*~


Last night I went to the shortest (but still boring) catholic weddings EVER. ~*~*~  I wasnt even related to the people who were getting married, and I hardly knew them, but Mandy was a brides maid (cause she is the bride's cousin)  and Dette decided to go, because the mother of the bride asked her to make a 5:00 boudin run *drooling over boudin* for the reception.  That was tragic as all hell, because she went to the reception hall and nobody was there, so she had to drive back and forth from the hall to the church like three times just to find somebody to let her in with the boudin! 

So the wedding didnt last for very long, I'm not like a hundred precent on how short it was, but it was definitely not a traditional LONG ass catholic wedding, which surprised me, but then again it didnt... because I'm sure the bride and groom wanted to just get out of there and go party LOL.  To sum it up... a friend of the bride read a few selected pieces from the bible, the priest got up and started talking about the union of the couple, and repeated a few things like 5 times! (That was tragic...) then the priest said ""Do you?"", the bride said ""I Do"", the priest said ""Do you?"", the groom said ""I Do"" ~ they kissed (twice... so cute!) then everybody left LOL.

I went with Dette to the reception, and I only saw a few people I knew (I didnt even expect to see that many people) and we stayed for maybe an hour and a half, then I left with Mandy *YAY* I was like SO tired last night it was pathetic.  I was gonna go with Mandy to Lafayette, but I was like about to pass out.  I went to bed around 12:00 I guess, Lexie let me sleep until 2:00, and then she woke me up... for reasons unknown to me, I think she had to potty... which was weird!  So I let her out and then decided to just stay awake, because Lexie was being a little BITCH, cause she didnt want to go to sleep, and she wanted me to play with her... WHO DOES THAT!?... LEXIE! ~ So I stayed up until like 4 something, Mandy got home, we talked about her little party she went to, then I went to bed at 5 something after making a bowl of vanilla pudding and eating it with bananas and sugar... GOOD STUFF! I wished I had Nilla cookies though... sad that I didnt.


~*Movies*~


The other day I was watchig ""I Love The 70's"" on VH1 ~ and on one of the segments (which ever year the movie was made) I saw bits and pieces of ""The Exorcist"" ~ and I so want to watch it.  Can you believe I've never seen it before IN MY LIFE!  How crazy is that!?  My mom wouldnt let me watch it when I was younger, cause she knew it would scare the hell out of me.  Although a lot of people say that it isn't scary, my little scared ass would have been tragically traumatized for weeks.  Sometimes Disney Movie villans would scare me... Yea, that's how bad it was LOL.  ~ Anyway, so now I really really really really really really really wanna see it, because I feel like years of popculture is just out of my reach until I see it fully. ~ And thats all I have to say about that... lol 

Have you ever seen ""American History 101"" ~ That movie is SO fucked up and horrible.  It's about racism... mostly.  But the story follows two brothers (and their family) ~ The older brother was in jail for *some years???* becuase he killed a black guy, and he used to be in this cult... sorta like the KKK, except more modern lol.  They would like start riots and just kill black people, for no reason!  Anyway, so the younger brother is following in the older brother's footsteps, and he's in the cult now.  He's doing bad in school so the principal makes him write this paper about his brother, so he writes all about the night his brother killed the black guy, and all the *important events* leading up to it that led him to kill the black guy... ok this probably doesnt sound interesting to you, but it really is a good movie lol.

You know what else is a good movie... 2 Fast 2 Furious... that's all I'm gonna say... watch it if you haven't... and if you have, watch it again!


~*Music*~


Yesterday *FINALLY* I heard ""I Wish"" on BOTH of my local country radio stations!  I was so psyched... like when I got in the car I turned it to my favorite (I dont like one beecause they dont ever play Jo... sadness I know!) and I caught the end of it, she was just starting the bridge, so I was all like ""YEA! WHEEW!"" and singing along, and then I just started to scream because I realized it was the first time I'd heard it ON THE RADIO, and not playing off the GH CD lol.  Then later I was listening to the radio station that I DONT like, and one song went off, then I Wish came on and I started to scream again! I was like trippin out, crazy me... boo that LOL.  I was just like ""I cant believe they're finally playing it"" lol.

Then after that, a little later on, I tuned into 97.3 (which is a station that is based in Lafayette, and I only catch it in certain parts of Lake Charles) and they were playing ""I'm Alright"" and I was happy about that, so YAY ~ Jo 3 times yesterday.  Needless to say I was all smiles for the remainder of the evening.


~*Complaints and such*~


I'm so f-in bored... I don't even know what to do with myself.  I'm also so f-in tired, I could probably pass out, but I wont.  I really need to go and run, but I'm too tired to even think about it, so I don't think it's gonna happen today :~(

I'm getting fatter by the minute.  I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror.  Last night when I was getting dressed for the wedding, I put on that maroon shirt that I wore for my Sr pictures, http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/nikweb/Nik01.JPG ~ and from the front you could see my love handles were poking out of my black pants, from the side I looked about three months pregnant, and my breasts... I had to wear a black tank top to hold them in... I can't believe they got so big! ~ Ok enough about my boobs, that's just obscenee lol boo me!

In other news, *which is not bad* I have only one month left til my Jo show, and I'm like counting down the weeks!  I like weeks better, cause saying 5 weeks, instead of like... oh I dont know, 20 some odd days, sounds like less of a number lol.  Is that weird?

I'm *not* afraid thats all for today.  I have nothing else going on in my head, except for sleep deprivation.  I'm about to go play Extreme Beach Vollyball... I think.  Unless my tiredness slows me down and I start losing my matches LOL.


Until Next Time,
Lotsa Love

"event","Last Sunday was eventful... Brandon and Khris talked me into (which didnt take much work) going to The Sea Wall.  That was fun stuff.  We went rollerblading, then we went to play at the Wood Park, which is actually called Millennium Park, but *I* call it ""The Wood Park"" 

Anyway, we took pictures, which was fun... although they didnt come out so good.  Maybe you'd be interested in seeing them anyway... 

This picture: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/nc01.JPG
was taken while the sun was going down, we were eating tacos from Taco Bell... looks like Khris is snorting crack, but in an actual fact, he was drinking some SoBe out of a straw... that we took from Taco Bell.. lol. By the way... I was trying to use my phone and call back my ""missed calls"" that I missed cause I was listening to JO DEE too loud in the car, so I didnt hear ""Stand Beside Me"" ringing out of my phone! 

This picture: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/nc02.JPG
was supposed to be MY picture with Brandon, but Khris was being retarded and he was PRETENDING to fall over the railing... goob... So you only get to see half of me... and some of Brandon's hand...

This picture: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/nc03.JPG
Would be Me, Khris, and Brandon (in the back)  
Khris has some sort of ""physical attraction"" for me, so... he was pointing toward my breastises, which have swollen from the large amount of food intake I've been subjecting myself to.  Boo the fact that my stomach is disgusting... *remembers when it didnt look like that*

This picture: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/nc04.JPG
THE ONE normal photo IN THE ENTIRE BUNCH... Brandon, Me, and Khris (Khris is such a nerd... and I look like I'm on drugs... I have no clue what happened to my right eye... DONT LOOK!)

And then there was this one: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/nc05.JPG
Ok, maybe there was ONE other normal picture... Mandy and Me, and Brandon and Khris

Holy crap... that was interesting wasnt it? LOL Yea I know, festive... we had more fun than the pictures show...

Khris actually FELL flat on his back from skating ... I was putting on my rollerblades, so I didnt get to see it, but it was really funny when I looked up and saw him lying flat on his back... I was like ""TOPHER!! YOU FELL!"" *We call him Topher... like Khristopher... but without the Khris LOL funny name, totally suites him, cause he's such a goober!*  Anyway, when I actually didnt fall I was really excited, then again I wasnt going nearly as fast as I was that time I really did fall, and get my knees all nasty... By the way, they're doing ALOT better, because they dont even hurt so YAY MERRILY!

After we skated and got our fill of being goofy by the Sea Wall and boardwalk, we crossed the street and went to The Wood Park (Millennium Park)
Here are some pics of ""The Wood Castle"" *IT ROCKS MY NON-EXISTENT SOCKS OFF!!*
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/wp01.jpg
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/wp02.jpg
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/wp03.jpg
this thing is freakin HUGE... 
Just to give you an idea of how big it is... I stole some pictures from the actual Millennium Park website (I cant believe they had one... LOL) These pictures show the building of the castle, with grown men standing by it and inside of it... and the green slide is hiden inside of it which is really cool, cause you go up inside of it, find the slide, and come down and end up on a totally different side you started on, and you get to go back into another part of it... SO MUCH FUN! I LOVE THIS PARK!
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/build01.jpg
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/build02.jpg

Here are more pictures that I stole from the official website... they're small, but you get the idea...
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/mill_park.jpg
See the black fence... they didnt used to have that around the park, it just used to be open, but they had to put it up because bad ass teens were going inside the castle and scroggin'... BAD !!! OOOM!! *tisk tisk*
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/mill_park3.jpg
And there is a view from inside the fence

Here is a picture of me from LAST winter... Since I was showing off the park, I thought I'd add this one in too.
http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/wp04.jpg 
Despite what most might think, that water behind me is not a fountain.... actually the blue stuff is a non-slippery material that is sort of padded incase a child DOES fall while playing in the ""water spout""... have you ever seen Blank Check?  You know when Preston brings that chick on a date and they go play in that water thing that shoots water up... well thats what that thing behind me is lol.  Except the picture was taken when only the middle part was shooting water up.  I actually couldnt believe that they had it on, because it was REALLY cold outside.  I was FREEZING!

So are you bored of this yet?  Me too... Lets quit.
I just wanted to update and show everybody my pics cause I said I would, and now that I've done what I said... I'm finished.


Until Next Time,
Lotsa Love

"event","I went to get an application today for The Buckle, cause apparently two of their workers just up and quit... like totally walked out. Now that I'm realizing there MUST have been a logical reason... I'm scared to know what that reason is. 
On the aplication, the last little thingy you had to fill out was something to the affect of - ""What do you like most about your personality? What do you like least about your personality? How can you improve the company with your talent?"" 

Well naturally, my ""bubbly"" disposition, and my ALWAYS happy mood would be my BEST qualities, (the past couple of weeks are an exception!) - and of COURSE I have NO faults, because I'm utterly PERFECT! LMAO! JK! ~ But the thing that came to my mind about my ""talent"" and how I could improve the company with it... well... I was half tempted to put ""I could make lots of sales on guys shoes and apperal by giving blowjobs"" ~ But then I was just like ""Ew! that's disgusting!"" because of course I'd never do that... I have this motto... ""That only goes ONE place"" ~!!!LOL!!!~

So like... what do you guys think my faults are? Personality wise? COME ON SERIOUSLY!! I need help! And I promise that I wont hate you after you tell me the truth.  I'm just going to take the constructive criticism and redirect it to improve myself .::Smiles::.

Anyway, as some of you may know, I've been TRYING to diet for the past few weeks, and I have been living off soup for about a month.  Well I went and bout some Smart Start cereal, and... God that stuff ROCKS MY NON-EXISTANT SOCKS OFF!!!

Besides that, there really isn't a whole lot going on, besides my agravation at the WHOLE day because I couldnt catch The Wayne Brady Show... cause Jo was performing Heaven Was Needing A Hero on it today, and there was much sadness and regret at my house because I searched for it numerous times on the TiVo, but it just wouldnt pop up, so I was like ""I'm doomed to never see it"" - but hopefully somebody will be nice enough to send me a copy *ahem, and you know who you are lol*  I watched the Tribute To John Ritter special hosted by Diane Sawyer... I got a little teary eyed... It's like SO weird because *I* watch the late night re-runs of Three's Company... and its so hard to believe that he's not alive anymore.  Like you know how sometimes it just doesnt occur to you that ANYONE can die, and evetually EVERYONE WILL die.  Well thats kinda like what it was like for me when I found out that he had passed away.  It's like it's still not real to me, because I can still watch him on TV and it's like he's still there... but he's not... ya know what I mean?

Doesnt that make you think?  Like at any minute, anyone you know could just die... How scary is that? It makes me feel like a horrible person because for the past year I seperated myself from my family members because of my mom and dad's divorce.  If my great grandma would die (and I know she will EVENTUALY) I'm going to be really torn up about it because of how I've been distant from her.  But it's sort of hard to just walk into somebody's house that you dont feel emotionally close to anymore. It's sad to admit that I'm not as close to her as I used to be, (which was like REALLY close) but it's the truth, and I cant change how things have turned out.

""Divorce"" ~ That word makes me cringe.  It makes me scared of the word ""Marriage"" ~ Because in my life, I've seen so many ""marriages"" end in ""divorce"" that I'm not even sure that I want to take that step to get ""married"" ~ Because I'm afraid that my own ""marriage"" will end in ""divorce""


That's all I have to talk about today... Jobs, Personality, Sadness, Agravation, Death, Marriage, and Divorce ~ Welcome to the ""Real World"" ~


Until Next Time
Lotsa Love

"event","So it's the 'anniversary' of the tragedy that occurred on 9/11 - So many people were lost, so many wives lost husbands and vise versa, so many babies were born without daddies, so many people lost a loved one, but alot of us are still here to remember those who are no longer with us.

I think Jo said it best with ""Heaven Was Needing A Hero""


I came by today to see you
Oh I had to let you know
If I knew the last time that I held you was the last time
I'd have held you and never let go

Oh it's kept me awake nights wondering
Lying in the dark asking why
I've always been told you won't be called home
Until it's your time

I guess heavn was needing a hero
Somebody just like you
Brave enough to stand up for what you believe
And follow it through

When I try to make it make sense in my mind
The only conclusin I come to
Is heaven was needing a hero like you

I remember the last time I saw you
Oh you held your head up proud
I laughed inside when I saw how you were
Standing out in the crowd

Your such a part of who I am
And now that part will just be void
No matter how much I need you now
Heaven needed you more

Cause heaven was needing a hero
Somebody just like you
Brave enough to stand up for what you believe
And follow it through

When I try to make it make sense in my mind
The only conclusion I come to
Is heaven was needing a hero just like you

Heaven was needing a hero
That's you

"event","I've seen better days, and I'm happy to report that today is one of them.

I talked to my friend yesterday, whome I'm calling ""Puddin'"" cause thats her Shortcake name *yay merrily for the shortcakes!* and it was a good chat, and I'm glad I got to talk to her.  She hadn't started the chemo yet, but she was feeling a little sickly, but as usual, being upbeat and lively.  It was just nice to talk to her and joke like we always do. It was refreshing for the conversation to be fun, and not depressing.

Today had a schedule... I was SUPPOSED to wake up at 10 a.m. so that I would have PLENTY of time to eat, get ready, and take Brandon to get his pictures for school taken... well I was being REALLY lazy, and didnt end up waking up until amost 12:00... so I had JUST enough time to wake up, eat REALLY quickly, get into the shower, and then fix my hair and get dressed so I could take him to Puckets Photography Studio, which is like 30 minutes from here.

After he took his pictures we went to the mall, because I wanted to check on my baby *this really AWESOME jacket from The Buckle*
I walked in, and the first thing one of the sales girls says is ""I have that shirt!"" (I was wearing my Miss B. Haven shirt from Amercian Eagle) and I'm all excited too, I'm like ""oh yay! thats so cool!"" so she's like ""Yea, I havent worn it yet though... do people like talk to you about it? Do they realize what it says?"" I'm like ""Oh this is the first time I've worn it, I got it like at the beginning of last week."" she was like ""Oh I got mine like two days ago."" so she finally says ""Is there anything I can help you with?"" Because I'd moved on to the jacket rack by then, but they didnt have the jacket in the right color. It was the darker one, but I wanted the lighter one. So I'm like ""Um... is there an expectancy of getting in a new shipment in on this jacket in the lighter color, like in the window?"" and she was like ""Well I really dont know, but I could order one for you."" So I was like ""yea we could do that!"" So I was happy... I went with her to the counter, she called it in, and now all I have to do is go back on Friday and put it on layaway with some monies, and then it'll be here in two weeks YAYNESS! So I can wear it to my Jo show! YAY!!! BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HEHEHEHE! Sorry, lol I was excited. I love shopping!

I think I'm also gonna ask when I go on Friday if they're probably going to be hiring during November, for the xmas season, cause they always do that! I think I'd honestly like to work there, because the girls were really nice, surprisingly.  Plus I like their merchandise! Hehe.

Today is a kinda slow day, much like all the days this week... I really dont have anything else planned, so I can go get undressed, take the bandaids off my knees (had to put them on cause I'm wearing pants) and eat some soup... Ugh... I looked at myself in the mirror today and noticed JUST how fat I'm letting myself get... I'm so unhappy about that... one day I'll finally realize I have to STOP giving in to the temptation of eating GOOD food and just STICK to the stuff that isnt going to make me fat... thats so hard for me though... I have NO self dicipline... boo that!

I'm really wishing today was tomorrow, because I FINALLY GET TO SEE JO ON TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL! YAAAAAAAAAY!!! It's my dream come true LOL I thought I'd never see it, which was honestly depressing, cause the only way I'd see it was when somebody FINALLY decided to send me their Jo tapes, so I could make DVDs for everybody! ~ Speaking of which, I was telling one of my ""Non-Jo-Friends"" *boo those!* about how I was gonna make DVDs for everybody and all that, and they were like ""Hey, you could totally make a business out of that!"" I was like ""No way! I feel bad enough for ""downloadin the clothes!"""" LMAO they had NO idea what I was talking about of course, and not many people who werent at the FCP DO, but those of you who KNOW the funniness of ""I'm just downloadin these clothes"" are like laughing your asses off right now! YOU ROCK!!

On another note, I just wanted to say... those of you who are my friends, and have actually been READING this boring thing... Thanks for listening to me being all depressed and stuff, and thanks for sending your support and trying to help me pull myself out of the rut that I'd been in for a while. I hope that you'll be happy to know that I think I'm finally getting over it.  Today was the first good day I remember having in a long time.  

Anyway... I guess thats really all I have to talk about. I'm gonna go eat some soup *yay...*

"event","Today I dont know if I feel better or worse ~ I feel like I want to go and crawl back into my bed.  I stayed up until until who knows what time this morning.  Fell asleep on the couch because it was entirely too hot to go and get in my bed.  At 6:50, I was shook awake and told to go and get in my bed. Thank God the air conditioner fixed itself after all the ""Freeze"" went away.

I think I'm in a bad mood because of sleep deprivation... I think I'm going back to bed.  Maybe when I wake up again I'll be in a better mood.

Boo being awake right now... Hey, at least my new picture of the Tartiest Raspberry Tart is adorable... thats enough to make even *ME* smile... sha her!

"event","To be inspired to write is something that I often need.  Somehow, my friend Krissie always seems to know how to inspire me, or con me into writing... which ever it is, or how ever it works, here I am once again, writing... 

I guess that most of the time, I'm not really inspired to write here as much as I am in say... MSWord ~ Fics rock, but not my fics ~

I'm not here to talk about fics. I'm here to talk about depression, heartache, heat, and whatever else ends up being typed out tonight.

Depression ~ 
I've been a little depressed over the last few days.  It comes in spurts.  You could say I'm sort of like a schizo.  One minute I'm fine, the next I'm just sitting around like ""blah, I'm so unhappy"" ~ more often than not, I dont even know why.  I want to talk to someone about it, but I dont really feel like anyone wants to listen.  Do you want to listen? ~ Well even if you dont, I'm talking anyway, Ok? Is that ok with you? ~ Good.
So I've been depressed, and I dont know why.  Maybe I feel like my life has no meaning or direction.  Maybe its because I just need something that I'm not getting *cut to me wishing I knew what that something was so that I could fix it* Or maybe I'm just being selfish.  Then again I could be depressed because I've been in a slump when it comes to ""relationships"" ~ Dont get me wrong, it's not that I'm having a problem with bad relationships, its just that I'm having problems GETTING a relationship.  I'm going to stop talking about this now, because I know that my relationship status is NOT the problem. I dont NEED a guy to be around me 24/7 just to make me happy. In fact, I think thats the last thing I need, some guy taking up all my personal time, getting me pregnant, then leaving me alone with a baby to raise, F that!

So I'm having a little anger problem with the situation of my friend (no names) being pregnant and her boyfriend wants nothing to do with her, even though its his fault that she's pregnant in the first place.  I mean, who gets a girl pregnant, then says that the baby isnt for him, when he knows FULL WELL that it is! He tries to act like she's a slut, and that the baby is for someone else, beause he's too scared and immature and childish to take the blame for it, and he doesnt want to give up his life for some mistake that he made.  That's just bull shit, dont you think?


Heartache~
A friend of mine, who also happens to be a friend of Krissie's, and yes, isnt it great that we're all Jo fans *but thats not the IMPORTANT thing here ~ although still VERY important* anyway, back to my original statement... a friend of mine has cancer.  That breaks my heart.  It's like, you never think it'll happen to you or someone that you know, until BAM, one day your friend is like ""hey did you talk to so and so?"" and your like ""No.."" and the friend is like ""Well..."" and then your like ""whats going on?"" and they cant TEL you, because its kinda like... a private thing, so you have to WAIT until the ""so and so"" tells you themselves, and they say ""are you sitting down?"" and your like ""yea.."" and they say ""i have cancer"" and its just like BANG BANG! you shot me down BANG BANG! and i hit the ground, BANG BANG! that aweful sound BANG BANG! ~ Ok, sorry for my little Cher intro, but THATS what i felt like! How can you just sit there, and NOT be affected by someone saying ""I have cancer""? It's like one of the worst things that a person could ever say, and it just rips my heart out every time i think that this wonderful person could have so many troubles and she's so young.  She's just the sweetest person you could ever imagine to meet or know. she's such a little soldier... and through all of this, she still manages to joke, and make the best out of everything.  I am in total awe of her.  She's like my hero. Just this wonderful, vibrant, amazing person who I totally look up to and love with all my heart.  I'm so glad that I can call her one of my best friends.  And isnt is sad that she lives so far away from me?  I wish there were more I could do for her than call her up and be like ""hey, how ya feelin?"" 

I guess with all bad news there is SOME good news... she told me that she's got an 85% cure rate, which is really good... I mean thats better than nothing, right? RIGHT! She starts chemo tomorrow... I can only imagine what that means for her.  I know that chemo drains you, and makes you lose your hair... But I know that she's going to turn it around and make it ""a good thing"" no matter what.  

I wish I could say so much more, because she totally deserves my praise, but all truth be known, I havent got that many ""smart"" words in my head to fill the ""praise box"" so I'm just going to end it with this note
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
To one of my best friends, I love you, and my prayers are with you.  I'm always thinking about you, and your NEVER far from my thoughts.  You made a place for yourself in my heart, and instead of it (my heart) being smaller because of the space you took, it got bigger.  I send all the love in my heart on angel wings.  Hang in there ""Puddin'"" 
Love, from your fellow shortcake, R. Tart
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

And finally...

Heat~
Yes... the air conditioner broke ONCE AGAIN at my house... If being depressed, and worried about my friend werent enough, the damn air conditioner had to freeze up.  It's not sweltering yet, but it is pretty hot.  I'm glad that its night time, and sort of cool.  Tomorrow it's gonna be bad, because i know once the sun starts to come up, and the humidity sets in again, life as I know it will be like hell on earth... literally. Have you ever BEEN to a sauna? Well if you havent, come spend the day at my house for free! You'll feel like you've been to the real thing... but your f-ed if you think your getting a massage afterward LOL  You could change some smelly diapers though, we love help here at the daycare!


Other things~
Tomorrow there is this movie coming on that I want to watch. It's called Sex and the Single Mom... the previews looked really good... but it's coming on LMN... go figure LOL I havent REALLY watched LMN since... wow, I cant even remember. But those shows always depress me, because someone is always dieing, or getting raped, or beat by their husband, or father, and its just like ""ugh, I cant watch this anymore"" 
But this movie looks really good, plus Gail O'Grady is in it, and I LOOOVE her! She's such a great actress, but you dont really see her in alot of stuff.  Anyway, so this movie is about Gail (she's the single mom) and her daughter.  They're both just getting into relationships (as far as I can tell from the previews) and the daughter is like 15 I think, and so she's just starting to want to get sexually active... well Gail is old, so of course she's sexually active with HER new boyfriend... well apparently she gets pregnant, but all at the same time, she's trying to tell her daughter not to have sex... Thats all I'm getting from the previews, but I still wanna see it, because it LOOKS good... 

Have I rambled enough?  Was that my inspiration?  I feel a little shortchanged, like I didnt do my job.  Maybe its because of the heat... maybe its because I'm still depressed... maybe its because I dont know how to put all of my thoughts and feelings into words... maybe its a little of everything.  Can anyone tell that I'm screaming inside my head right now? If you've actually made it this far down... congratulations... I really appreciate the fact that you've taken the time out to listen to/read my ramblings.  I need to hold your hand now... and can I have a hug?  Sometimes I just want things to be ok, but are they ever really? Maybe sometimes... I'm gonna stop now. I have to go plop down on the couch in front of the three box fans and watch TV after I take a perciset... hopefully it will *and I know it will* knock me out for at least 8 hours. I'm tired of feeling things for toady, or tonight, or this morning... it's almost 3:00 A.M. by the way.  I cant believe I felt I had to share all of this with you.  God your such a good person to have made it this far.  I cant even believe that *I* made it this far!

Well thanks again for coming, and if you felt like this was therapeutic for you as well, then I'd be delighted if you dropped by again some time. The thing is, I think we both know that I'm a little crazy, and if your uncomfortable with that, then maybe these little sessions arent the answer LMAO ~ Aw look, I made myself laugh... the first step to recovery is admitting you've got a problem.

My Admittence~
I've got a problem... I'm depressed, and I dont know why.  I'd blame it on knowing that my friend has cancer, but I was depressed before I knew that, but now that I know that, it just adds on to the whole doom and gloom.


.::Here Is Me SCREAMING::.
SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! PULL ME OUT OF THIS DARK HOLE!!! SAVE MY LIFE!!! TAKE MY HAND!!! DO SOMETHING!!! HELP ME!!!



Until Next Time,
Lotsa Love...

"event","So, I'm all like rollerblading yesterday, getting in my exercise so I can drop a few pounds, instead of sitting my lazy ass on the couch and eating.  I even made a *special* CD for running/rollerblading (ALL JO OF COURSE!) 

Shh, dont tell her I downloaded clothes!

So anyway, I'm going like REALLY fast, I mean, I could have been in at least second or third place in a roller-thon... So I'm goin, I'm all pumped up, listenin' to mah Jo (Bye Bye), goin, goin... OH SHIT, THERE'S HUGE BUMP IN THE PAVEMENT WITH ROCKS! 

Nikki go: DOWN~BAM~SKID~SCRAPE~TUCK~ROLL AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

So I'm LAYING there... in the middle of the road... yes, in the middle of it... I'm not crying, and it actually doesnt hurt that bad, so I get up, and I go to the side of the road where my CD player and CD skidded off, and I pick them up, and rollerblade myself back home.

So I open my door, rollerblade to the couch, sit down on it.. and only THEN do I realize the extent of my injuries. Now when I said ""SKID~SCRAPE"" I DID MEAN ""SKID~SCRAPE"" ~ My knees are all scraped up, it' looks disgusting. So everybody starts freaking out, and I'm just sitting there laughing, so I wont cry. So they take me into the kitchen and make me put my feet in the sink, and they rinse the cuts/scrapes with the little hose thingy, so even WATER hurts, so I'm screaming BLOODY FREAKIN MURDER! so they start making jokes like, ""Puuuush!"" (like i'm going into labor) lol, cause thats literally what it sounded like... I tell ya, if labor is worse than that... F havin' kids! LOL I'll adopt, or be childless for the rest of my life lol.

Sooo... after the water comes the peroxide... that surprisingly didnt hurt as bad as the cool water, but it still burned, so like me, Mandy, and Dette are all BLOWIN on my knees LOL and I'm like about to hyperventelate... (Spelling) I'm like beating on the cabinets, biting down on a dish rag, basically anything to distract myself from the pain. I cant SQUEEZE the rag, because my hands are also scraped up.. bah... boo yesterday

So after a few hours of being laid up on the couch watching TV, I look down at my knees cause I had to go potty, and the fatty tissue in my knee has fluid and it LOOKS like my bone/knee cap is protruding out of the side of my knee, but it was only the swollenness of it.. it was SOOOO UGLY! 

Well needless to say, I got like maybe 3 hours of sleep last night. I went to bed at 1 something, got up at almost 5 because the pain was just so unbearable, it was biting through me, and I couldnt sleep.  So I got up and Mandy gave me a pain killer - then I went to watch TV and eat some Captain Crunch. Then I started to get nausiated, yuck, so I went back to bed because the perciset (spelling) was making me so tired I was about to pass out. I was dizzy even while I was laying down, so it was pretty tragic.

So I went to sleep, and not that long after I dozed off, Dette comes in the room and she's all like ""gimme your knees"" so she put some of this stuff that is a spray and acts as a bandaid and numbs the skin, without actually haveing to be a covering, like a bandaid. Then she puts some actual vitamin E pills (the liquid) on my knee, then she put some MORE of the spray stuff to seal it. The spray stuff burned and we had to blow, so here I am about to hyperventalate again lol. Craziness.

So I went to sleep again and slept like a rock from like 8 something, to like 2:30... then I got up and my knees actually werent swollen like last night, which was really good, they're just honestly disgusting and tore UP. 

I guess I should be happy that I didnt fall and scrape my face up, or hit my head and black out and have a car come and like RUN me over LOL even though that is very unlikely, because the road that I was on hardly ever has cars, which is why I was skating on it.

My luck is the worst ever when it comes to injuries. Especially with my kness. When I was in 6th grade, I was playing with this ball swing at my house, and I had a plastic chair set up, and I would jump from the swing with the ball and swing on it, so I would go really high, then when it would stop swinging so high, I would jump off, like Tarzan or something LOL ~ Well some how or another, in mid-air, my kneecap popped out of place because of the way I threw my leg out, and then I fell onto the ground and further injured it by landing on it... OUCH! 

So then about a year (or less) later, after my knee had  healed up, I did it to the OTHER knee, while I was playing basketball at school. Then like 2 years after that, I was at this party for one of my guy friends, and it was dark, and I was running for some reason unknown to me, and I fell into a hole, which twisted my knee (that was popped out the first time), and popped the knee cap out of place again.

And then LAST year, I was trying to get something (I do believe it was a pack of Reese's LOL) out of the trunk of Mandy's car, and I was like ""OH NO! They're melted!"" so Mandy is like ""well come on, just leave them."" and she SHUTS the trunk... and my NOSE was in the way.. I thought I would be scarred for life, it started to bleed horribly... the really really sucky part was, we were about to go into the movie theater (AH!!) so I had to go watch the movie with toilet paper stuck to my nose... Imagine my embarrassment! I tried to keep my head down and pray that no one would see me lol.

Well, this is just my luck, things were going to great (the Jo show in 2 months) and SOMETHING bad had to happen... I guess that'll teach me to wear knee pads and all kinda other protection next time I go skating.

The silly thing is, I actually WANNA go skating again, but I know next time that I should go and buy some gear... pads, helpments, shin protectors, I'll look like a professional! YEA! LOL WHEW!! LOL


Ok, thats all for today. I'm feeling a little woozy and I hope I didnt make too many typoes, other than (spelling words I cant spell)


Until Next Time

"event","Ok, so I'm posting for the second time today, which sometimes isnt odd, because when I get in a good mood, and I wanna talk about stuff, this is the product of the craziness ~

Anyway, so I'm coming home from a little shopping trip, went to check on my baby (this really awesome jacket from The Buckle, that I absolutely MUST have, and I probably WILL, unless I find an even better one, which is very possible, because I have another two weeks until I get paid again... or is it just one? I lose track, it doesnt mater, moving on!) So I'm listening to Jo (GH) and I'm on my second round of ""I'm Alright"" and of course everyone knows the part where it goes ""We kept a lotta friends, skipped a lotta class, been on top of the world and knocked on our ..."" 

Well anyway, just once, I wish she would say ""ass"" instead of ""...""

Like it's really cute how she STOPS singing and just SMILES, like ""nuh uh, i'm not sayin it"" LOL ~ But just once... I'd like for her to say ""ass"" because I think I'd drop dead if she actually did LOL

Now I know that Jo prides herself on not using ""swear words"" ~ and I think thats awesome, because alot of people *such as myself* dont work at ""refraining"" from using such words. But wouldnt it just be a little funny if she said ""ass""... just for one time!?

Ok, I'm finished ranting about ""ass""
Now I'm gonna take mine, and run it across the living room, so I'll catch ya lata

"event","So today's weather forecast was yucky... but it didnt get my spirits down.  I didnt wake up until 2:00 because the rain soothed me while i slept.  After i woke up, i sat down and wrote a chapter of my fic ""Perfect, Until Proven Otherwise"" ~ I've decided to dedicate it to a very special friend of mine when it's finished.  I still have about four pages left to write on it, but when it's completed, it'll kind of shed some light on why its so special, and friend oriented. 

I just finished eating a Dreyer's strawberry popsicle, and oh Lord, it was heavenly... I advise everyone to go out and buy a box of these.

I was talking to Coley Kissee, and he let me read the lyrics to this song he was working on, which was inspired by ""Would You Be My Wings"" - I thought that his words were very profound, and they hit me *right there* ya know...

When I have a down day, would you be there with me?
When im lonely and bored, would you be my company?
When im sad and depressed, would you be my shoulder to cry on?
When I fall down, will you pick me up?
When im reaching for my dreams, will you be there with me?
When im being judged and tried by the world around us, will you stand beside me?


I think that sometimes we all have to ask the people who we love these questions, because we have to know that we have their support.  Thats why i loved it so much, because i feel like i need to know that my friends and family will be there for me.

If you dont have friends and family, who do you have?



Until Next Time,
Lotsa Love

Besides the fact that today is one of the most bless-ed days of the year *because it's Jo's birthday* ~ Today was pretty boring/mind-numbing.  I hope that Jo had a good day though.

I remember my birthday... it kinda sucked actually.  And it was supposed to be all ""special"" cause it was my ""18th"" ~ but... it wasnt.  So I hope that Jo's thirty... 25th was AWESOME! 

Oh wait, it's not even over yet! LMAO

"event","Hey all you lovely people out there who take time out of your busy schedules to read *MY* online journal.  It's so great of you to stop by today, because your in for a real treat.

Now tell me, how many of you remember the song ""Strokin'"" by Clarence Carter?  Come on, you know you wanna sing, ""I stoke it to the east, i stroke it to the west, i stroke it to the woman that I LOVE THE BEST, i be STROKIN'!"" LMAO!

Anyway... so I'm like sitting here and I'm going through my old leopard print CD case that holds like 200 CDs... and I'm stumbling across these like... 2 year old CDs LOL so I pop a few into the CD player, and I'm listening intently... so this one that is in right now has like 5 Jo songs on it... and a few other pop thingies.. fun stuff, ya know... 

So its a totally random CD ~ but listen to this... I click the button to switch songs from Britney (bah) and track 15 is, Jo - Closer (LOVE THAT SONG!! ~ who doesnt? LOL) So then i'm all Jammin to Jo, singin along, breakin it down, then sadly the song starts to skip... cause the CD is scratched.. (it just HAD TO BE SCRATCHED ON THIS SONG DIDNT IT!?) so i switch to track 16.. and guess what familiar beat starts playing...
You guessed it... *thudding music plays in the background*
""When I start makin love, I dont just make love, I BE STROKIN'!""

""Now when I'm makin love to my woman.. I dont stop... until I know she's sassy-fied... and I can AL-WAYS tell when she gets sassy-fied... cause when she gets sassy-fied... she starts caaaallin my name... she says 'Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, eeeww SHIT, Clarence Carter'! ""

LMAO!!  Who doesnt LOVE that song... Ah, good times.

"event","Ok, last night I finally finished the book ""Why Girls Are Wierd""

I loved that book so f-in much! LOL it was hilarious lol. Special Thanks to Krissie for telling me about it.  Without that book, I may have never known why I'm weird.  I've come to the conclusion that its some guy's fault... 

Isn't that always the case?  I mean really?  Isn't it always easy to blame everything on a guy?  I think so too!  Let's all blame EVERYTHING on a guy!  Come on, it's fun! Say it with me now ""*Add random/specific guy's name here* IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!"" LMAO! SEE! HOW MUCH FUN WAS THAT!? 

Anyway... To update from the last few days... NOTHING has been happening... Yesterday, I went to Lafayette, and babysat Mary-Margrett, Claire, Anne Francis, and Avery.  It would be pointless to even BEGIN to tell you who these children are, so i'm just going to leave it at that lol.  I'll just say that they have no relation to me what-so-ever, and that they are the nieces of someone i know.  there... thats really all you need to know right? right!

So i took Mary-Margrett (5) and Claire (3 - almost 4) to McDonalds, and let them play in the playplace... that was all fun and good... then brought them back to their mommy and then like 30 minutes later i left to make the hour trip back home.  It started to rain REALLY HARD on the way... so i'm on the interstate doing like 30, because i can barely see the white lines on the road, or the tail lights of the car in front of me.  So finally the rain slacks off, and i get home safely.. duh lol

The day before yesterday is a little fuzzy... i'm not really a hundred percent sure WHAT the hell i did... and as the days get further and further away... they're just blank, almost like they didnt happen lol... now there is no doubt in my mind WHY i write down what i do every day in my daily planner LOL... i guess i could go through it and put down what is in the little boxes for each date for this month, but i chose not to. that would just be pointless and none of you really care anyway... who actually reads this thing besides like 4 people i know anyway? LOL

Mkay... well, i'm gonna shut up now and stop typing random thoughts before this turns into the longest entry EVER... I'm just gonna wash some clothes or something... and i WONT write that down in my daily planner, because thats not what i did all day. 

Actually, i slept until like almost 2:00 p.m. 

When i woke up, i helped with the kids (daycare) because they were aslo waking up *from their naps* - so i put their shoes and socks back on then brought a few of them to the bathroom to let them potty (the ones that are potty trained) and then i brought them to the kitchen for their snacks.  yay merrily, i'm such a big help lol.

After that, i took a shower, and then i sat down and started to write the rest of chapter 3 to the newest fic i started, entitled ""It's Too Late"" 

The story is about Jo and Kenny... if you havent started reading it yet... you should. Ya know the site right?  If you dont, just mail me and ask me for the link, of course i'll give it to ya!

Wow... did i really just talk more even though i was supposed to stop?  God... dont i always do that?  I'm such a goob... i really gotta get some kind of meds for that LOL :~p


Until Next Time,
Lotsa Love

"event","Sad for the fact that I HAD TO DO SOMETHING... and it just so happened to be... *Jaws Theme Plays In The Background* With my mother... bah.  I guess it wasnt so bad, I got two CDs, a bikini, a KICK ASS FUCKING JACKET, and food out of it...

So my mom calls this morning at like 10 something, she's like ""ok, I'm leaving P.I. - I'll be there in an hour and a half.""  So I'm like ""ok"" so I roll out of bed, I get in the shower, do by business, then get on the computer and start downloading music so I can make a CD... shhh, dont tell Jo I was ""downloading clothes"" *They werent her clothes, so its ok!*

Well needless to say, I got a little carried away with my clothes downloading, and my mom shows up and knocks on the door, and I still have a towel on my head. I'm like ""oh shit! your here already?"" so I let her in, set her up in front of the TV while I take 30 minutes to do my hair and make-up and get dressed, so then we leave. 

We head to Applebee's, where I had THE most exquisite chocolate cake after I had my steak... Oh my GOD it was lucious! Mmmmm lol I'm ok.  I knew I'd feel guilty about it later, and I so do... but imagine a big slice of chocolate cake, with whipped cream on top... EAT IT! EAT IT! EAT IT! LOL 

After we left Applebee's, we went to TargEY, cause typically, their CDs are cheaper than at Wal-Mart.  So I bought Wy and Jessica Andrews new CD.  Then we went to Goody's and Old Navy... didnt find anything good at Goodies, which is... baddies, so we headed to Old Navy, and I found the most lush-a-licious jacket... its khaki, and has zip pockets, and the jacket zips, but a flap covers the zip, and it also has buttons.. ah I LOVE IT. I also got a ""scenic"" purple bikini.. ya know, the tropical island with trees and water and such... yea, ""scenic"" lol I was lovin it up, I absolutely had to have it.  It was all good, cause I got the top and bottom for $8 each.  which is good, considering the original price was like almost $16 each, so YAY

Then we went to The Shoe Carnival, which was uneventful, cause I only saw one pair of shoes that even remotely caught my eye, and they were dressy, but I was looking for Nikes.  Then my mom told me she was ready to leave town, so she brought me back home, and I'm like SOOOO tired lol.  I proof read 2-4 of my newest fic that I've been working on, and now I'm about to end chapter 4, yay merrily.  


Well, Until next time
Lotsa Love

Holy Crap! I so cant wait.  Ok, now about today...

Today SUCKED... ok not all of it sucked... this morning I had to go to my ""home town"" where my old school is... and get my dad's pay check, so i could bring it to him at his ""current residence"" ~ i went to my old school, saw a few of my old teachers, they were ecstatic to see me of course... three of them said ""What are you doing here? You never came to school last year!  Now your graduated, so you come!?"" I was like ""Its the fact that i'm rebelling, cause i'm not SUPPOSED to be here."" LOL

So after i left the school.. i went to see my aunt, then went to see my grandma... uneventful... then i had to RUSH back home and pick up Mandy at work, cause.. i'm a bum, and i had her car so.. yea lol. So then i had to GO TO MY DAD'S HOUSE... and get my money... but he was no where to be found, so i had to wait for like half an hour.. bah... But now i'm back home, so yay!

I'm going to see Uptown Girls in about.. an hour... Maybe if i'm up to it, i'll post about it when i get back home.

"event","Ok ~ Before I knew the greatness of The Jo, I knew the greatness that was... are you ready for it... The Bette.

Yes, I'm really talking about Bette Midler... LOL don't ask.  I was young and stupid LOL JK, I love Bette! She's great... The Devine Miss M... wow... how did I end up LOVING TWO DEVINE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR LAST NAMES STARTING WITH M??? OH MY GAWD!!

Anyway, so on one of my Bette CDs *Bette Of Roses* I absolutely loved this song called ""The Last Time"" and I would listen to it repeatedly, it told a story about... this person who was intentionally cruel, and god it was just so great, because who doesnt have to put up with cruelty in their life?  And even though someone is constantly cruel to you, you love them... right? right! But eventually, your going to get tired of it... wow... that song was SO great... I so want to listen to it now! These are the lyrics:

Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Ooooooh.
Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Ooooooh.

I have no guts. I have no pride.
My heart is weak. My love is blind.
When your game is up I'll still be by your side.
If you love me at all, let this be the last time
that you break my heart,
that you break my heart,
that you break my heart.

You hurt me so much,
but I love you forever
'cause when you tear me up
you always put me back together
ever so gently,
ever so gently.
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah.

Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Oooooh.
Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Oooooh.

I bite my lip and hold my head up high.
I try my best not to let you see me cry.
I can take a joke and you can be unkind.
If you love me at all, let this be the last time
that you break my heart,
that you break my heart,
that you break my heart.

You hurt me so much,
but I love you forever
'cause when you tear me up
you always put me back together
ever so gently,
ever so gently.
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah.

Mmm, you hurt me so much,
but I love you forever
'cause when you tear me up
you always put me back together
ever so gently,
ever so gently.
Baby, let this be the last time.

Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Oooooh.
Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, Oooooh.
Let this be the last time.
Let this be the last time, whoa.
Ohhhhh, whoa.
That you hurt me at all, yeah.
The last time. Whoa.
Whoaoooo.
Whoa. The last time.
Oooh, yeah, the last time.
Oooooh, yeah, the last time.
That you hurt me at all.
Yeah, the last time. Whoa . . .


Holy Crap, everybody who has ever had a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or a friend treat them horrible should SO download this song, despite the fact that Bette may not be your most favorite person in the world... its actually a good song ok!


Until Next Time

"event","Today, or yesterday (considering that I started writing this at 1:24 in the morning) was ... uneventful.  I had to get my dog groomed, but shes adorable now so yay - Her hair is too short now to even be considered as ""Don hair"" - which if you know me, you've probably heard me talk about Lexie's Don hair... See, when it gets a certain length, it starts to look.. REALLY REALLY LOOK like Don's hair... if you know who Don is, your probably going ""oh my god..."" LOL - thats exactly what i thought too when i realized, holy crap, my dog has Don hair!

Ok, enough about Don hair, thats just trashy, movin on.

Ok, so I brought my dog to get groomed; I dropped her off at the groomer at like.. 12:00, she wasnt done until about 5:00 - but the groomer was very busy.  Needless to say, I liked this lady (Michelle) a whole lot better than Petsmart and she charges less! YAY! So I found a new groomer for my dog, yay merrily.

So in between the time it took for Lexie to get groomed, I wrote on two of my fics, got chapter 16 done on Breath Of A Scandal, and part of 17 done... link: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/BOAS.htm

I also got up to chapter 4 done on Perfect, Until Proven Otherwise, but there are no links up for that yet, I still have a little work to do as far as proofing goes, but the link for chapter 1 is: http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/bestkeptsecrets/PUPOC01.htm

So after I went to pick up Lexie, I came home and fell asleep... that was around 6:00, and I didnt wake up until like 9:30.. sadness lol I ate two grilled steak taco's from taco bell and then vowed that I'd go on a chicken noodle soup diet!... we'll see how long that lasts lol. I also tried on my bluejean jump suit that actually didnt make me look fat, I was like YAY

Ok, so see... uneventful... besides the fact that i FINALLY watched Tim McGraw's Driven, which I recorded on Tivo the other day, just so I could see Jo Dee... duh! she was adorable! Ah, I luv hur!

Okay, I'm gonna stop being gooberish now and just end this insanity...

"event","Well... today is a sad day.  My friend Abby sent me a letter... enclosed was a picture of her on her grad day, which is special, but the thing was, i almost didnt know who was sending the letter in the first place, because apparently, on the way over, the corner with her name and address was TORN OFF! and the post office stuck her letter into another envelope.  

So in the letter, Abby says ""I hope you like the necklace"" .. then goes on to describe it, saying there is a sun on it, and when she saw it she thought of me, because of.. Jo Dee.. and You Belong In The Sun... so she bought it for me, AND SENT IT TO ME! HOW SWEET IS THAT!?... well seeing as how the original envelope was torn open, the necklace wasnt in there, so it could be lost anywhere!  I'm so unbelievably sad about that fact.

Another thing i'm sad about is.. all of my friends are going back to school! and i'm all... graduated! ok, not ALL of my friends are, but the ones who are a year younger than me, or just happen to be in the class of 2004... are going back to school, and its a sad story.

I so cant wait until next summer! FAN FAIR, JO DEE!! wheew!

I'm so determined to go to at least ONE Jo show before the end of the year though... god if i dont, i'll be the saddest little girl in my life!  Seeing as how the Asheville show was canceled, i got a little discouraged, and i was like ""i'll never see her..."" *sadness* - so i went out and spent the money i was supposed to use on buying plane tickets, and paying for the show tickets ON CLOTHES! to make myself feel better... well now i regret it, because now i'll have to ask my dad for even MORE money... but at least i'll have clothes to wear to my next Jo show right? RIGHT!

My dad... ha... i told him, ""dad, you working to support my habit, pay up!"" LOL he was like ""yea right, you need to get a job""... i want to get a job, but i need a car, so i say ""buy me a car"" he says ""get a job"" i say ""i need a car cause i cant get to a job without one."" he says ""your shit outta luck""... LOL!

Why cant it be like in the storybook fairytales... happily ever after? Ha ha, not in mine fairytale.  In my fairytale, everything happens exactly opposite.. instead of the prince sweeping me off my feet, he moves away... instead of flying away to never never land, i have to settle for a cancelled Jo show, and NO FLYING!  Instead of being driven around in a horse drawn carriage, i have NO car... figures... Was that my life?


Until next time... 

Lotsa Love

"event","Today is probably going to be one of the more uneventful days. I have to go to Cameron, which is a little spot in the middle of no where, close to the water, but it has a small beach, so coolies right? Wrong! I'm so not going to the beach today LOL ~ I have to go and pick up some money from my dad's place of residence, cause I'm a child, and I need support... hence... Child Support Money.

Yea, speaking of which... My mother.. she calls me the other day, and she's all B*tchin' me out, because I never call her, and never want to go and see her, but I mean, who could blame me? She's so... UGH, I dont like her... plus she lives so far away! But anyway, the thing she tells me is ""You aren't really supposed to be getting your dad's money anyway, your 18 now""... I'm like UGH your SO JEALOUS! cause.. see, she's really supposed to be getting alomony, but my dad hasnt given her hardly any money because... he gives it all to me, so yay! So anyway though, you could imagine how agravated I was when she told me that ""your not supposed to be getting his money"" line. like oh god... whatever.

So anyway, I guess I honestly dont have any other plans except for... maybe I'll tan.  I was thinking of getting a self tanner from Wal-Greens, beause my friend used it, and it looked awesome.  It was this lotion that would go on as not a coloring, but just... like, it would pull the darker pigments up to the skin. So I think I'm gonna get that.

Wow, something unbelievably ME just happened... I'm talking to my friend Krissie, and she's all like ""This CD kicks so much ass."" so... I'm remembering from last nights conversation, that she was supposed to bring her Live Bernadette Peters CD to listen to on the way to work.  And she works at an ice cream shop... so I put the relationship of CDs together, then, the fact that she works at an Ice Cream Shop... and now I'm hungry for ice cream, what the hell?

I'm such a little weirdo... In the words of Queen Latifa - Bringing Down The House: ""You are some kinda freaky."""

"event","So I've wanted to graduate since before I even started Kindergarten.  Funny how I knew that I would hate school before I even started right?  For the first two weeks, I cried to go home, because I hated it soooo much!  Then I just got over it, and realized that if I sucked it up for long enough, eventually recess would come, and then play time, and coloring... 
So then I get into first grade, and its all down hill from there. So I'm graduated right? Right!  But the bad thing about no school is... my perception of dates, and timing, are ALL screwed up!  I totally forgot my friend's birthday, which was two days ago.  I'm sad about that fact, and I know he's even more sad.  But it was easy for me to forget, because I have nothing to base time and dates on anymore.  I think I'm falling into a black hole... or a purple and pink one maybe... 

I've finally arrived in the world of Krissie, and our other fellow fan fiction writers.  Today, I thought up at least two different ideas for two different new fics, and I'm already writing on my second, then I started writing ideas for the sequal to my first... now I have these two other ideas, and I think I am kinda excited to write on like four different fics at once.

oh my god, I got like three rolls of film developed yesterday, they were all from fan fair, one was of kenny chesney at the river front park, and I was like YAY, I got one of his butt, yum! and then on that roll there were some of Jo at the convention center, YAY I didnt even remember that I had taken those on there! So needless to say I was excited. and then one was supposed to be all Terri Clark, and Mark Wills, but... only one of terri's came out, and four of Marks... I was sad, I didnt even take those home, I just gave them back to the lady at the photo center so I wouldnt have to pay for them, so she threw them away.. um.. and on the other was supposed to be like eight pictures of Wynona, but only one of those came out, and I used the rest of the film (Since I got a new camera battery ~ at fan fair, for Wy's performance at the coliseum, my camera DIED! I WAS SO SAD!) on Trace Austin, hes so fat! LOL sha baby.  Oh, for those of you who are like ""what the f..."" Trace Austin is my little cousin, he's like four months old, he's precious!

Ok, I have nothing else to talk about... YAY THIS IS MY FIRST ENTRY!"

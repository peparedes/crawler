"event","So I've been trapped inside this sickness cave that I call my room here at home for the past weekend.  Being sick is horrible.  And why do I always get sick during finals.  It's happened everytime since senior year when I had bronchitus. So I had to get out of the house..so me and my mom went shopping! For once, we didn't fight or anything and she just kept buying me stuff..it was great.  I'm the first person to admit that I'm a tad bit materialistic, but hey I'm a girl who knwos what she wants and gets it..enough said. So basically I'm getting like a gajillion peices of jewelry for Christmas including my wonderful Zales pearl and diamond set, some ""fake"" (jeez i hate that word) tiffany's jewelry and some pretty schnazzy other stuff.  And I'm getting this bag that I picked out at Details thats by this designer Melie Bianco.  The girls on Laguna Beach had like 31354681 bags by her.  I learned this after I picked it out lol.  
My sister came in on Saturday with Emar and the 2 puppies! It was the first time I got to see Jack and he's like the cutest pug you will ever see.  I wanted to steal him from her so bad.
I got to see Sugarland, Brad Paisley, and Sara Evans in concert on Thursday. It was great but I probably wouldve enjoyed it better if I wasnt sick.. and if my cowboy hat had come in on time.
So I'm going back to Ship tomorrow for my Government final and the party at Bill and Travis'.  I have a final on Thursday and a project due by the end of the week.  Have I done any work for anything?? That would be a negative. Not looking forward to the next 3 days.."

Even still, if there is<br>something that you believe strongly in, you<br>will commit yourself totally to that cause.<br>Your weakness is that sometimes you can be<br>indecisive and perfectionist, especially about<br>little details and you drive people crazy<br>sometimes with these traits. With the
innocence of a Hufflepuff and the calm of a<br>Ravenclaw you will be loved in life!

Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 
Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 
There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 

This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 
You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.
You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

I got some of my broadcast writing homework done whioch is good cuz now I dont have to worry about it for a while. 

Wednesday I'm meeting with the Study Abroad lady..I seriosuly just want to go to England NOW.  I dont want to wait. 

Oh! BTW, I made Concert Choir! Woo!  I'm excited.

"event","I was tagged by crazy_betty..

List ten fictional characters (not actors/actresses) you would want to have sex with and then tag five people. Any media (movies, books, video games, etc).

10. Rusty Ryan (Oceans Eleven and Twelve)-Brad Pitt in a nice suit makes my melt.  He's also just funny in a ""I'm not trying to be funny, it just happens"" kinda way.

9. Ben Barry (How to Lose a Guy In Ten Days)- Ok so he was an ass for making a bet at work..but they needed a plot line somewhere.  Theres just somehting about a guy with a southern accent and a really nice body.  Whoever gets Matthew McConaughey is one lucky woman.

8. Steve Hale (Full House)-  I just love Steve and his obsession with food and football--typical guy.  And I love the fact that Scott Wiegner is the voice of Aladdin(who almost made the list).  It makes me happy.

7. Ryan Atwood (The OC)- Hot but quiet.  He can tell you anything with just a stare.  And he's slowly becoming funnier-much to Seth's dismay. lol

6. JJ Pryor (American Dreams)- I love a man in uniform.  And his strong, stable personality in the show just stands out.  He loves his wife and his child more than anything in the world.  I'm not sure which JJ I like better-- pre-Vietman or post-Veitnam JJ.  But overall, he is a support system for the Pryors and his new family.

5. Cory Matthews (Boy Meets World)- I must agree with Katy on this one becuase I grew up loving Cory and envying Topanga.  I just love him more than words can describe.

4. Chris Peirce (American Dreams)- Played by none other than the fabulous Milo Ventimiglia.  Think Jess from Gilmore girls only make it back in the 1960's.  Enough said.

3. Micheal (Roswell)-  I was originally going to pick Max instead by Michael is just (honestly) so much more interesting than Max.  Theres just something about the bad boy that you just gotta love.  The uncontrollable nature of him makes him so exciting and I need a little excitement in my life.  But deep down he cared deeply for Maria whether he wanted to admit it or not.

2. Seth Cohen (The O.C.)- Ok we all know why Seth is number one---if you dont you dont deserve to be my friend..seriosuly.  I love guys who can make me laugh and no one can resist his dorky charm.

1. Noah Calhoun (The Notebook)- I consider this oe of the greatest love stories of our time told perfectly in Nicholas Sparks' book and performed even better by Ryan Gosling.  Noah's just so down to Earth, loving, and caring that he would be the perfect guy.  Plus the way that he always remained in love with Allie through everything and always believed in their love would make any girl want a man like him.

His voice, his charisma, and his talent have had a lasting impact on my life and what kind of journalist I want to be.  
I think thats its better that he wasnt on the air for the last four months.  At least the shock of him suddenly not being there wont be a problem.  But I will certainly miss the man who I turned to when I needed to know what was going on in the world. And I know Im not the only one who will miss him.

Harry Potters coming out soon!  I really wish I remembered what happened in the previous book better..sigh. I guess Ill just be confused bc I dont have the time nor patience to re-read it.  Afterall Im still trying to finish the Da Vinci Code becuase the new Gossip Girl book and the new Nicholas Sparks book got in the way of that.

"event","So..I'm home. For the summer.  But for some reason (even though ALL of my crap is currently scattered around my house) I just feel like I'm here for the weekend and then I'm supposed to drive back down to Ship on Monday.  I guess that's just becuase that's what I'm used to doing.  What I'm not used to are my parents.  Already I've had a little ""fight"" with my dad..but I guess that can be expected.  So tomorrow will consist of going through all of my scattered crap and putting things away.  Weird. 
I already miss having Hope across the hall from me.  and I'm gunna miss everyone greatly, but theres always next year for the vast amjority of my friends.

The year as a whole went by soo fast..even thogugh it was off to a slow start at first.  I made it thru marching band (lol) and History w/ Reber.  And living with a roommate. And I joined a wonderful organization that is SUTV and NBS.  I got to go to L-freakin-A!  I became a sister in the best damn music fraternity EVER! And through all this I got to meet some of the coolest people in the world.  Some are sadly graduating and to be honest I feel kinda jipped that I didnt get to spend more time with them.  I did meet some boys.  :) But unfortunatly I guess I'm just not good enough..But as I said before theres always next year for the rest of my friends.  

This year I think I accomplished soo much.  I got ""re-invent"" myself to the person that I really am.  I think I stepped out of my shell a bit. (THANK GOD!) And I feel very proud of everythign that I was able to do..especially as a freshman.  

I can't wait for next year-especially the apartment! But now I just need to spend some good old time with my friends from the valley--my girls-Katy, Tiff, Val, and Mary.  I need some of their lovin right about now. lol.  And hopefully I'll get to see some other ppl a lot too--*ahem* Mollie *ahem*.  

But right now I'm spent and I can't wait to not share a room and to sleep in my own, wonderful, big bed!!!  Night all.

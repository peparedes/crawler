Six days of work, one day off, eight days of work. If one were so inclined, one could sweep me up and dump me with the trash and never know there was some glimmer of awareness left in my battered frame still. The Aviodrome haunts my nightmares. The 1940s music played in the Schiphol 1928 building has lodged in my brain, tormenting my every quiet moment. Thus suffering, my mind spawns thoughts of violent, murderous retribution. The details are best left unspoken.

An exaggeration, to be sure. But Jesus Fuck am I tired. It is a good thing I have a loving girlfriend whom I can talk to at a long day's end, to help me relax and coax a smile onto my weary visage. What would I do without her? The thought ill bears consideration.

I will have my few months of semi-free time, soon. There will be paperwork and stress, but I have always had a talent for setting aside such anxieties as I cannot solve, so I am hopeful.

Now, if my amicable reader will excuse me, I am going to go talk to my girlfriend some more."

Found this somewhere. ""There must be an angel playing with my arse"" had me laughing. I realise I am completely weird, but then so are you."

I guess not, huh...

Again, I'm sorry for leaving you for so long. Life was even more interesting than usual for a couple of weeks, and when it quieted down again, I um, forgot about LiveJournal, pretty much. But hey, I'm back! Isn't that cool? Don't answer that.

The writing is... going. Slowly, but going. Vorjan, Gerrin + section and his love-to-be and a couple of other individuals are about to undertake a mission that should make the Ninth's next engagement a little less one-sided an affair than is currently being anticipated. The allied army currently retains a complement of 16,500 troops total. They face 69,000 demonically possessed warriors whose need for rest and sustenance seems limited. Where <i>do</i> the Rhevest get their supplies from? We're about to find out...

The viscount is rotting in a cell, Kenniv and Sessha are both merrily travelling down their respective paths, and Aelin has despatched the requested aid for Larsen. I must admit I'm already looking forward to returning to Kenniv and company. I don't know... I miss him. Is that possible? He's not even himself right now. But still, I like the guy, deranged killing machine or not.

In other news, the Egyptians are not letting up and are now employing a new unit in battle: Pharaoh's Bowmen have superior range and attack power, and are inflicting heavy casualties on my phalangites before they can close with the enemy. My own archers don't compare, and my trusty peasants, which I tend to employ in rear attacks on engaged enemy troops with devastating effect, can barely match them in close combat! Luckily, their tactics remain abysmal and so far I've always managed to outflank them eventually.

The Greek Cities are no more, and in the aftermath of their destruction I managed to wrest a city from the hands of the Lesbian Rebels (don't laugh, it's what they're called... I didn't invent it). The Pontic Empire lost two other cities to me, and with the gold generated by these ventures I have begun to expand my cities, building improved training facilities, roads, dockyards, farms and a host of other facilities that will generate enough income to continue this expansion. My diplomatic mission into south-eastern Europe has met with success, as I managed to secure a number of trade agreements and alliances that will serve me well in the future. The same is true, to a lesser extent, of my mission into western North Africa, where I encountered the Numidians, who happened to share my dislike for the Egyptians, as well as my interest in decent trading partners. An alliance was forged, and the Egyptians may look forward to a Numidian army on their Western doorstep soon enough.

I can really get into this stuff... :P

I lost her so many times. I remember, somehow. I remember the feeling of her self slipping away from me, slowly falling away, and me powerless to do anything. I can feel the unrelenting agony, the loss, the despair, the silent screams that ripped me apart and my soul, torn and rent, that still refused to break.

I am terrified of what I will feel if she dies. I am terrified of laying flowers on her grave and staring at her tombstone, with nothing but a collection of perfect memories remaining, ever dimming. I'm scared of living much longer than she.

I'll want to die. But I can't.

The thought of dying doesn't bother me in the least. I don't care about simple suffering. I can deal with all of it. But not this.

I pray my death comes soon after hers."

My villain gained a new dimension, born of a sudden stroke of brilliance while thinking about which character I would want to spend a day with. Now, his entire family was killed in some tragic accident with a peripheral connection to the Gods. Veranis brought them back to life for him (He's a god, too, he can do that), so now he has a new faith. Him and his family feel a debt to Veranis, and serve him willingly. Since members of that family are characters in the book, I will be able to write scenes that include lines like ""I was dead once."" I think I can do something with that.

Vorjan and Gerrin are about to go on a stealth mission. They will attempt to sneak into the Rhevest encampment and kill the Rhevest shamans while they're resting. The plan will fail horribly and many people will die, but they will find out why the Rhevest don't have a supply train with them, as well as some other important fact I have yet to determine. Hey, writing is discovering too! I'm learning as I write, you know. Anyway, not much later, Vorjan will be found out while spying on Veranis again, and Veranis will direct his army to wipe out the Ninth and the Chiragi in a night sneak attack. The allied army will leave behind about 3,000 casualties, reducing their total number of combat troops to around 13,000. 13,000 against 68,000. Seems fair to you? It's not, and the final battle will not be a pleasant one. Still, Maduka is a master with tactics, so I'm sure we'll be able to come up with something.

In other news, the damn Pontic Empire and the Armenians are invading from the North and I have precious little to stop them with. The Egyptians are being their usual asshole selves, and that's tying up all my best troops. How am I supposed to go on the offensive if I can barely maintain my defence? Still, things are steadily going better. I've launched a diplomatic mission to the Greek mainland, in search of allies and trading partners. With the income that will hopefully generate, I will be able to muster an expedition into Egyptian territory. The Pontic Empire will get its rear end handed to it shortly by a ragtag army made up of various units drawn from garrison duty but nevertheless commanded by an able general, aptly named Alexander. Well, at the very least they will lose a province to aforementioned army.

Hoplite tactics are finally becoming clear to me. The finer points of manoeuvering a tightly formed block of spearmen didn't come to me by themselves. Historically, the Phalanx was fit for one thing only: form up, and advance! Several ranks of men with very long spears, packed tightly together, presenting many spearpoints to the enemy. Unfortunately, they are very inflexible, and the tactical manoeuvering has to be handled by secondary units like cavalry. This, by and large, I have learned.

I think I've mentioned before that Rome: Total War is a lot of fun?"

Four days of working means four steady days of writing. I get up at 6:30 and write for an hour and a bit. I get some good words done that way.

I've left Tagun again. There's some scenes there that will need some tweaking, but I'm happy with the way things are developing. The relationship between Grej and Rathil is interesting. As a matter of fact, as bad guys, they're <i>all</i> pretty interesting. I've successfully eluded the pitfall of using cardboard cut-outs of one-dimensional black-and-white bad guys. They really believe in what they're doing, and they actually regret the bad things they have to do. When Sessha finally confronts them, there'll be some interesting moral discussion.

I'm back with the Ninth, and Vorjan just had a serious talk with the Chiragi gods about cutting him off when they did. The army will be facing the Rhevest for a fourth time soon, but even though the enemy has paid in blood for every mile they marched closer to their goal, the Dominion army has suffered heavy casualties as well. Vorjan is unable to employ his magical skills for the time being, so the weight of magical defence will have to be borne by the Chiragi shamans alone. That will leave no room for magical offence, so there will have to be some clever ambushing action, or the Ninth will fight its last battle.

Don't worry. I have everything under control.

Writing battles is tons of fun. I read a lot of books on military history, and it's a lot of fun to actually use some of those ancient tactics in a fictional situation, with the element of magic thrown in. The real challenge is the relationship between Gerrin and his love-interest-that's-not-a-love-interest-yet. This is going to be a WEIRD couple, let me tell you... But I think I'm going to have them save the world.

You know. Because I can."

Personal lives are interesting things. It's amazing how they can take up your time and thoughts.

Not a lot of news from this front. The writing is going but, as ever, going slowly. At least I fixed my Aelin problem. His personal conflict is a lot more interesting now, and I've created a potentially very interesting character for the sequel. Or book 3, or 4, or 5... We'll see, eh.

I apologise for having been so quiet. I might be for a while still... But I'll be back, I promise. At the very least I'll let you know when my book sells.

I so apologise... I've been spending too many hours on the phone with a certain someone. Still, there are no excuses. *beats self with club* Bad EJ!

The writing is going slow, but it's going. I'm doing a lot of work on the overall plot for the series. I think I have something good going, but I'll still have to see if I am capable of crafting it into a story I can tell over the span of about 6-8 books, without losing the stand-alone quality of each book. I'd like people to be able to pick up book 5, have a blast reading it, and then decide if they want to buy the other books too, without forcing them with an open ending with every book.

Aelin needs a LOT of work. His whole storyline barely ties in with the rest of the book. It's almost like it's a separate story, and that will not do. So I'll be doing some retooling on that. In other news, Rome: Total War is the new god of strategy games. Go play it."

When you find yourself wondering what they are doing at random points during the day

When, if asked for a random word, the first thing out of your mouth would be their name

When a compliment from them makes the sun shine brighter, and an argument can leave you crying in the corner

When, during idle moments, you find your thoughts drifting to them

When, during the time you're not with them, your soul feels torn and rent, as if something vital is missing

When, during the time you are with them, that feeling vanishes, replaced by a gentle cloud of intense happiness, and you live in the blissful conviction that you could not be happier in the world

Most of all

When they tell you

""I love you""

Your heart expands and fills your entire being with a bright golden light of pure joy and happiness

A smile comes unbidden to your face, and turns into a grin so broad it hurts your cheeks

You feel the urge to laugh of sheer happiness

When their arms close around you

Life is perfect

I love you."

Anyone who recognises that line, you've earned a cookie. Go get it!

Sorry for the long absence. I know there are many out there, waiting in breathless anticipation for an update from me (A/N: sarcasm, but work has kept me rather busy. Also, I have a cold. I'm not sure why that's relevant, but I thought I'd add it anyway.

Moving on to the writing... The novel is going well enough, but I've decided on a change of strategy. I will endeavour to write at least two short stories a month. This may turn into one if they end up like all my other ""short"" stories, i.e. really bloody long. This way, in about two months, I should have something new ready to submit every month. That gives me a better chance of actually earning a dime or two from this writing thing, at least before the Four Horsemen come to mess up my front lawn. The novel may also sell, but before I have that sucker done, edited, rewritten and off to an agent/publisher, another year will have passed, <i>at least</i>. And let's not even think about all those long months they make you wait while your manuscript makes it to the top of the pile.

It's really quite simple. I need money. And why not make it by doing the thing I do best?

I find myself distracted from the work that needs to be done by work that will need to be done... in the distant future. More to the point: my mind keeps going over ideas for book 5 or 6, while I'm still plugging away at the first one. I need to focus. I need to concentrate! ...concentrate! ...concentrate...

Hello? ...hello? ...hello....

Echo! ...echo! ...echo...

Weird... Anyway, recent progress has been slow but steady. At least I'm writing every day, and that's a good thing. By the way, if my muse talks to you, don't believe anything it says. It's a shameless liar, in contrast to myself, as I am completely and utterly trustworthy.

Lightning and a thunderclap? Sky's clear, not a cloud in sight. Weird...

Right now, I'm at the start of Aelin's little bit. In preparation for what will surely be a harrowing task, I've gone back to read his introduction and subsequent scenes, trying to get back some feel for the character. I can only hope this will turn out well... Worst case, I'll have to redo his story in the rewrite.

Hm. Better do a good job, then. -_-

After that, though, it's back to the army, and although my outline is a little vague on the next couple of their scenes, my familiarity with the characters and affinity for battle scenes convince me that I will do fine with them. I need to get some serious work done on that romance thing, though, if I want to have it done by the end of the book. Gerrin will have to get over himself.

I've worked out the two major storylines for the series. I'm not going to put them up here, but I'm very excited over them. There's plenty of work still to be done to tie it all together, but I am confident I'll be able to do it all justice.

Yesterday I worked all evening. I had to man the front desk during a big, big party. From 17:00 to 01:00 I sat behind the counter, chatting with mi amor, occasionally writing on my laptop... It was a lot of fun. Earlier that day, I had written one of the more difficult scenes so far. Lymenia, Rennis' wife, got to be a POV character. And that's what was so hard, because I really don't know her that well yet. That scene will be subjected to a great deal of editing later on. Still, I finished it all in one session and that was good, too.

Now, Rathil is giving his report to Grej, and soon they will be scheming again. I glanced at my outline and realised that within a couple of scenes I will be back with Vorjan and the 9th army again. Those dudes are taking up a LARGE part of the book. But it must be said that I don't mind all that much. Vorjan may be my favourite character of all, and the battles are always fun to write.

In other news, Realms Of Fantasy's slush page tells me the next batch of submissions was dropped off this Saturday. Gods willing, it should include mine. Oooh, suspense! I submitted Finally Valiant a bit ago, and soon they'll be reading it. I hope they buy it... Besides the fact that getting published is ALWAYS cool, I could use the money.

Ah, well. Happy thoughts and good hopes! Any prayers sent my way will be very much appreciated and paid for in full... In some next incarnation."

So it's been a while... Apologies for that. So remember the demon I talked about? Well, my mind has done it again. This time I introduced a magician. He was supposed to give a report on what had been going on to Rennis.

One scene, <i>one bloody scene</i> after I introduced him, he became the father of all the Gods. And it is not a joke.

I wanted to make him mysterious. So I clothed him in concealing robes that left no skin exposed. I gave him the habit of rarely meeting people's eyes. When he does, they are shocked and feel spellbound. The eyes are a radiant blue, etc.

So I began thinking, what could that mean? Why is he like that? One thing led to another, I considered the possibility of him being a god, I considered the possibility of him being the God of all Gods, and here we are.

Now that he has assumed that role, the plot for all the other books in this series began to take shape. Ancient races reclaiming their worlds, betrayal and family ties among gods, and the entire mortal realm fighting for its very existence.

I have never, ever felt so good about the writing. The ideas slammed into my mind with the frequency of machine gun bullets, leaving me with barely enough time to get it all on paper. I've since taken the time to shape it all into something coherent.

Writing is the best job in the world. Where else do you get to feel like this?

Next task: creating a time line for my world. No, I haven't done it yet. Yes, with a project of this scale, that is bad. And now, I need one more than ever."

More writing today. I was lazy and played Fantasy General until 4 PM, but I still got a good hour and a half of writing done. The wordcount isn't spectacular, but I finished the scene and I think it turned out pretty good. I give some attention to Rennis' thoughts and feelings about what might happen to his son. So far he's been too much of a cold hearted bastard about it. Actually, I think he still is.

More feeling! MORE, I say! It's hard, when he doesn't get that many scenes. But that will change. Even then, though, writing emotion and things like that has never been a strong point of mine, I think. More like writing sweeping battles. Um. I'm not even sure if I <i>have</i> any strong points. Well, plot, I think. The greater scheme of things is always foremost in my mind.

Other than Rennis and his sappy stuff, there is the creepy mage character I created. He's just a minor character, and probably won't come back, but I feel he lends a surreal touch to the whole scene. maybe I will do something with him, I don't know yet. See, he's invisible, but you can't tell because he wears his red robe thing.

Next up will be--

Oops. I think I need to go back and add something. Next set of scenes will be Aelin and his merry band, but what happened to them will have to be shown in Rennis' scenes, too. Or maybe Li's fifteen seconds of fame will do... I don't know. I can always go back and add it later. It is important though; Aelin gets his first clue that a traitor is present... Ooooh! Stay tuned!"

Isn't it odd how time can pass so slowly when you are waiting for something, and then when you check your Live Journal and see that the last post was from four days ago, you think ""Has it really been that long?"" I wish time felt like it was going as fast as it seems to have gone when I look back. Does that make sense? Does anyone care?

Procrastinated?

That is <i>such</i> a writer's term. It's one of those words all writers know, and the only reason they know it is so they can give a name to the whip they use to flog themselves when they've spent another writing session staring at the screen, occasionally writing a word and then deleting it, only to ultimately cave in, give up, and turn to Solitaire.

Ahem. We now return to your irregularly unscheduled programming.

So, I procrastinated all through Sunday and Monday, not writing a single word. I have excuses for each day, but I will not dishonour this journal by posting them. They're crappy ones, regardless. But on Tuesday, I finally sat down, and over the course of forty-five minutes filled with good music, cheesy fake swordplay and hard thinking, I figured out how Rennis knows the Begotten will attack the repair site again. I fixed it with magic. Isn't magic great for solving problems? Anyway, it makes sense here, and it doesn't seem fabricated. Trust me. And if it does I will fix it in the edit and you will never ever know. So nyah.

This afternoon, after a delightful MSN chat with a friend from CMM, I sat down and did like maybe 200 words. Nothing grand, but it's a start, and once the scene is started the rest always comes easier. Still, I'm finding it sort of hard to find Rennis' voice again. It's been a while, you know. Could this be a problem? Bloody hell, if so, I am not looking forward to doing more of Aelin's scenes. Is that guy still alive in my head? Hmmmm... Maybe I should kill him then, instead of *CENSORED*. Nah. Or should I? I am evil...

I'll have to see if the problem goes away after writing a bit. My weakness, I think, is that I tend to focus more on the plot than the characters. Of course, one can't do without the other, and I do realise that. Some characters come to life more easily than others, I guess. Maybe I need to read what I've written again a few times. Rennis is a good guy and he deserves for me to get him down right."

Today I went with some friends to watch their daughter perform in a big ballet thing. It lasted like two hours, but it was never boring. It was a very large group, with kids ages 7-17 or something around there, I believe. There are some skillful people there! Their balance is amazing. And the young ones are so adorable! I think I have developed an appreciation for ballet now. ;)

Alas, no writing this morning, due to some emotional disturbance. But I had little time anyway. I spent a bloody half hour going to the place where I dropped my pictures off only to find out they didn't have them yet! Even though they promised ""delivered on Thursday = ready on Saturday"". Unreliable bastards. Next time, I'm trying another place. Or maybe I'll learn to develop my own pictures. What was that college course again, love? Photography?

I have hit another snag in the writing though; that much I was still able to determine this morning. Rennis needs to try and ambush the Begotten, but to do that he needs information on their whereabouts. Where would he get that information? I'll think of something, but this <i>is</i> something I need to spend some time on. Sometimes I wish I hadn't ignored these problems while I was making the outline. Perhaps I didn't though; it's a lot harder to think of something believable if you don't really know how the rest of the book looks.

Ah, well. This is not really a bad thing. I'm hoping this will give me a chance to explore Rennis' character a little more, as well as his storyline. As for Aelin, man. Is he ever getting shortchanged. He's had the least scenes so far. He's not that bad a guy! And if I'm going to make anyone care about the climax to <i>his</i> storyline I'm going to have to make them care about the character itself first. Right now, <i>I</i> barely care about him.

Work In Progress, indeed..."

I forgot all about updating yesterday... And I had so much to say, too! But I seem to have forgotten most of it... What a shame.

Work was nice yesterday, despite the persistent headache. We had two birthday parties... And I was to be the guy who shows them around and tells them when to do what. More precisely, there's a part where they dress up as little pilots and/or stewardesses, and then we take them outside and take group pictures with airplanes in the background, or sometimes actually inside the airplanes. So this time, I was to be the photographer.

So far I'd always managed to get out of doing that somehow... I don't consider myself particularly good with kids. But it was actually a lot of fun! The kids were very cute and nice, and the parents were very happy with me. I'm such a well-mannered, professional guy. Or so they say. :P

So that was fun. Earlier that day, the writing went okay, too. Alyhandra pays Kenniv and Aysil a visit and reveals a secret regarding the relationship between Kenniv and Aysil. Turns out they're more closely connected than Kenniv ever thought...

I briefly considered trying for a romance thing between them, but the way Kenniv is now, there's not a Redwood's chance with Bush at the reins of <i>anything</i> developing there. Besides, the relationship I just mentioned would make it... awkward, at the very least. Maybe in the sequel

Don't you just hate when you're writing merrily along, and you're getting all these wonderful, <i>wonderful</i> ideas for the sequel? That's what's happening to me... The ideas don't stop coming. I don't think it's a bad thing: once this one is done I'll be able to dive right into the plotting for the sequel. But it <i>itches</i>, you know?

Ah well. Who's complaining? Not me, that's for sure."

Writing was kind of weird today. It went well, and I loved the scene I wrote. Kenniv loses his temper again, but he doesn't take it out on another person. Something else suffers the brunt of his rage (quite a spectacular rage). I'm worried, though, that when I edit later I'll think Kenniv's voice is too inconsistent. Time will have to tell if the nature of his story justifies that.

Anyway, something I had him do reminded me of InuYasha. So, I wrote:

""...screamed at the top of his lungs: ""KAZE NO KIZU!""

Those of you who know InuYasha know what that means. Of course, he didn't do that at all, and I went back and deleted it right away... But it was funny that my writing should suddenly include bits and pieces from InuYasha.

""Those of you...""

Just who are ""you"" anyway? There's not a whole bunch of you, I suspect. In fact, I'd be surprised to find that anyone besides myself and mi amor were reading this. Why do I write this, then? Well, since I feel no need to stop writing, I am pleased to conclude that I am writing this for the only worthy reason: because I <i>want</i> to.

Aren't I cool? Don't answer that.

Tomorrow, I will have the pictures developed I took when I was with my darling! That'll take like two days and then I'll have some wonderful colour memories..."

More evil Kenniv today. The battle with the demon is over, and the way I ended it, well... It made me sick. I took a shower to feel better.

I remember Kenniv in The Sword And The Lady. He was such a great character. Wise, loving, compassionate, strong... Look at him now. Look at what I did to him. He's worse than the demon he fights. He's nothing but a destroyer of souls. And the worst of it is, he enjoys it! He's become the image of everything I hate in the human nature. And I hate him, too.

I hate the horrible things he does, he disgusts me for taking pleasure from it. I despise his weakness in allowing himself to break his vows, no matter the reason.

I'm... not sure I can forgive him.

And what's weird is, I spent the <i>whole afternoon</i> writing that awful scene, writing much more than I usually do. I felt horrible as I wrote. So why did I keep writing? I suspect it's the muse at work. Someone should have told me beforehand that writing fiction can be the epitome of self-torture...

Well, at least I got a lot of words. And I think I've done all the <i>really</i> bad scenes now."

After a full week off from work (due to the fact that we need to cut costs, not because I was on vacation), I was pleased to find that despite having to get up early, because I had to make it to work, I was still able to get up an hour earlier than I had to and write an hour. Apparently the changes to my schedule were not temporary after all, as I feared for a time.

While writing this morning, I came to a scene where Kenniv faces down a demon sent to destroy him. When I outlined that scene, I had intended to have that demon be just as the few others I've written in this book: scary appearance and not interested in talking, only killing. Instead, as I wrote his entrance, to my own genuine surprise he began to speak. In a friendly voice. Asking if he was talking to the right person. Looking troubled when the answer was ""yes"". Offering another solution.

What the hell?

And now I love the guy and I don't want him to die. Here you have a one-shot demon, brought up to serve as cannon fodder, and he's taking centre stage. I'm going to keep him around. I'd planned something very similar already, so it won't require any major changes. I've already given him a connection to Kenniv's companion, and two other characters. Old family friend and all that. This guy will be major in the sequel. Mark my words. Or not, whichever you prefer. :P

In other news, the place I work celebrated its first year of business today. It's the <a href=""http://www.aviodrome.nl/english-uk/"">National Aviation-Themepark Aviodrome</a>. I work at the front desk, selling tickets to visitors, answering the phone, taking bookings for parties, etcetera. The work isn't always the same, I have nice colleagues, I don't work too much and although my boss and I clash from time to time, it's generally a nice place to work. Especially for someone like me, who, because of his limited education (and limited by choice, I might add), doesn't have a popsicle's chance strapped to a jet fighter's exhaust of finding another job.

In any case, there was a little get-together after work. Which I found out about today. Which is a tad late to call home and say I won't be home for dinner after all. So I didn't go. Not that I really mind, I don't much care for that kind of socialising. It often involves a great deal of smoke and pointless nattering. But they could have let me know or something...

Ah well. No one cares. Least of all me. :)"

This world has way too many morons living in it. If we were to eliminate everyone with an IQ below 100, we'd be left with about 10% of the original population. What is wrong with people? During a quick trip by bike to drop off a letter at the post office, I encountered:

3 x pedestrians with dogs so ill-trained that the control their owners can claim over them is comparable to an average gnome's authority over a 300 ft. dragon. The result: having to come to a full stop to avoid mangling the creatures between the spokes of my wheels. <i>ANNOYING.</i>

2 x pedestrians crossing or walking in the fucking MIDDLE of the road, blocking my way as if that was their god-given task. The result: having to brake, which, with my 10-year-old bike, is accompanied by a squeak of sufficient volume to give a deaf 90-year old bereft of his hearing aid a heart attack, which in turn meant the offenders sprang onto the sidewalk with agility and speed not considered common in middle-aged imbeciles of this caliber. <i>ALSO ANNOYING.</i>

2 x cars parked in such a manner one might be led to suspect they were disguised police cars assigned to block off a section of the street. Seeing as such is nonsense, you'd think that perhaps police give some attention to correcting such behaviour. Unfortunately, you would be tragically mistaken. Aforementioned police prefer spending their time hunting down the rare biker who--gods forbid--has no light on his bike. <i>AGAIN, ANNOYING.</i>

1 x adorable little girl by the side of the road, firmly telling one of her friends to ""shut his lid"". <i>UNBELIEVABLY CUTE.</i>

All in all, there is hope for the world.

But not a whole lot.

I feel guilty for wanting to have children.

In related news, the letter I dropped off was my story Finally Valiant, addressed to <a href=""http://www.rofmagazine.com/"">Realms Of Fantasy</a>.

I disgust myself at times.

So I solved the Aysil problem. I had to rearrange her ancestry to do it, but her presence in the story now grants a whole new dimension to the villain. Plus, by rearranging some things and planning another character death, I now have a kickass ending, where before I was worried if my climax was epic enough.

So now I'm writing bloodthirsty Kenniv. And his words come easy to me. I write his feelings, his desires, so easily it's like I'm inside his head. Which is, of course, exactly where the writer should be.

That does <i>not</i>, however, make it fun.

What he feels, what he wants... I've felt it myself. I feel that I have. His deeply perverted craving for destruction, his unchecked desire to be in the rush of battle, his need to demonstrate his dominance of everything and everyone else. These feelings are far too familiar for me to feel comfortable with them.

He wants. He <i>desires</i>. And nothing can stop him.
Right now, Kenniv is more frightening to me than the villain.

I believe... I believe I was once a horrible, horrible person.
Our past lives are part of what defines us.

What does that say about me?"

Oh, dear. I didn't write today.

And then you get this guilt, you know? The demons' voices start to echo in your mind. You don't have what it takes. You'll never be able to keep up with the work. You're too slow.

You're not a real writer.

That one really sticks. I guess it's a major fear of mine. I chose the path of the fiction writer nine years ago, when I was eleven. I thought to myself, ""What am I willing to do for the rest of my life?"" And the answer was not designing buildings, or flying jet fighters (both of which I had considered). The answer was: writing.

I've stuck to that ever since. I'm Dutch, but at age 13 I decided to start writing in English, because it felt much more natural. At that time I was reading my first English books, too. Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, by Michael Stackpole. I still have it. It was my inspiration for my first serious attempt at writing a book. I think I got about 20,000 words into it before I gave up. The 20,000 I had were decent, especially considering my age.

As time passed, I was always working on one project or other, but never with any real dedication. I wrote when I felt like it, which was painfully rare. A friend found Forward Motion and directed me to it, and since then my writing life has taken a slightly more professional direction. I started using widely accepted techniques: I used outlines for the first time, etcetera.

The point, which has been thoroughly left behind, is that I've been wanting to be a writer since age 11. And I still don't <i>know</i> if I have what it takes. If I'm made of ""the right stuff"".

I suspect many established authors wonder the same thing late at night. A guy named Robert Benchley said: ""It took me fifteen years to discover that I had no talent for writing, but I couldn't give it up because by that time I was too famous.""

In other words... It'll probably be fine. I improve with every word I write (I like to think so), and it's not like I'm in a ""write or die"" situation right now. I'll just have faith that I will learn, and grow into the life of the fiction writer.

...Tea, anyone?

---

And then I suddenly see that I didn't even mention <i>why</i> I didn't write today! Well, mi amor was being her usual insomniac self. A nine-hour time difference with California doesn't change a thing for two people who both sleep whenever the hell they feel like it. Not entirely accurate, but enough to support the narrative. We talked on the phone from 10 AM to about 2 PM my time (and 1 to 5 AM for her, for the record), which was the time I really <i>had</i> to go because I had agreed to visit my mom this afternoon. I did, we talked, and before I knew it it was 4:30. Home by 5, enough time to call one of my colleagues and ask if I could get a ride to work tonight. There was a big meeting (ooh! Important-sounding stuff!) and everyone from the Front Desk department had to be there. Watch this space for future information on just where the hell I work.

In any case, meeting at 6, just enough time to indulge in 30 minutes of Black & White before I had to get on my bike to catch my ride. The meeting lasted much longer than planned, which, of course, I had planned for anyway. So now I'm back, it's almost midnight and the time to write has passed. Why, you ask? Because I'm a lazy bastard, that's why.

The muse will wake me tomorrow and repay my lack of diligence by ten lashings of the Whip Of Prose. I cower in dreaded anticipation. Until then, I shall merge my soul with my lover's by phone, until it is mimi time."

Knowing me, it will only take two or three days of intense posting until I lose interest in this thing... Isn't that sad? Ah well. Let's enjoy it while it lasts. :)

The writing went very well this morning. I got a decent word count and I finished a chapter. Sessha's scenes are now done; she'll have to wait two or three chapters until she gets a turn again. I hate to leave her; she's one of my favourite characters, and one of the two I brought over from The Sword and the Lady.

(Oh, that's something I probably forgot to mention. TSATL is almost like a prologue of sorts for this book. Both the major characters return in the book to play key roles.)

Kenniv is up next. Writing him is always a treat, because it's a challenge. Since he became consumed by his power, he's easily angered and always has this bloodlust simmering right underneath the surface. And it's getting worse, too. Things will come to a head in these coming scenes. In any case, seeing as he was such a calm, wise personality before, it's quite a change writing him like this.

Aysil... I'm not sure. She's Kenniv's God-given guide, but I'm not quite sure what role she has in the story just yet. Kenniv needs someone to guide him around, but she needs to be more than a plot device. She doesn't change throughout the story, and that's never a good thing. I do have something planned for her at the end, but that won't do her presence in the story any more justice.

Hmmm... I might want to do something with the family connections. Give a certain meaning to the events at the end by creating a closer connection to Kenniv. What does she do for him? She gives him someone to talk to (plot device), she guides him where he needs to go (plot device)... This isn't good stuff.

The worst part is, I knew this was going to happen but I just ignored the problem. And now here it is, all grown up instead of a little puppy and ready to bite me full in the rear. What ever shall I do?!

I am open to suggestions from any wandering soul who might have tracked his or her meandering path here... *sniffle*"

...we might as well add <i>another</i> entry.

I realise that, unless I give you some information on just what I'm writing and where it's going, many of the things I post aren't going to make a great deal of sense to you. So, here's what's going on in my writing life at this time.

The Big Thing, the Major Project, is a book. I've written one before; I finished that in a year and a bit, back in 2001-2002. Entitled ""Prophecy"", it came in at about 85,000 words. Maybe I'll put it up one day, so you can all point and laugh at me.

Well, it wasn't that bad, especially considering the fact that most people never even finish their projects. It was my first time completing a book, and that made it a major thing. The fact that it sucked wasn't really relevant. It's about two brothers, one good and one evil, who are taken at a young age so they can be trained. One is kidnapped by the evil guys, the other is taken in by a kindly old master. They learn lots of stuff, and through another main character's Point Of View we see how the continent is preparing for a war between the three good countries and the one evil country. In the end, the good brother defeats the evil guys and saves his brother, making him good again. If you were to read it, you would realise how simple it was. But I was proud of myself, and rightfully so, I feel. :P

After that I tried to write another, but I didn't do my homework: the worldbuilding sucked, the story was far too simple, the characters were born dead and the plot didn't include a resurrection, etc. By that time, I'd started reading Steven Erikson's excellent Malazan series. I was devouring Deadhouse Gates at the time, and the exquisite realism with which that man managed to write about his military campaigns, and whole world in general, really, convinced me that what I was writing was woefully inadequate. Basically, the story was about a number of families who ruled a country together, and the patriarch who wanted more power. He tried to get it by defrosting a bunch of dragons who had been imprisoned in ice ages ago, and blackmailing them with an artifact precious to them. There was a rebellion mixed in there, and a secret love affair, and it was all very interesting; and then it wasn't. Too simple, badly written, far too little attention to the worldbuilding... In short, it had to die. And die it did.

Before I'd really decided to let that project die the peaceful death it deserved, I sort of shied away from working on it. By that time (March 2003) I had a kickass idea for a story in my head that just <i>demanded</i> to be written. So I obeyed. The result was ""The Sword and the Lady"", the first story I was truly happy with. A swordmaster lives alone on a mountain, until an envoy from a village below comes to beg for his assistance against a mysterious attacker. He refuses, because as a Master of his art, he cannot fight, or he will be consumed by his own power. The village is destroyed. Later, a little girl finds him, the only survivor of the carnage below. He takes her in and teaches her the art of the sword. Years later, the attacker returns...

At 18K, it was a bit long, and I've yet to find a market for it. But I am very proud of it. Writing it felt like I was taking a bucket of pre-ordered words and just... throwing it onto the paper and lo and behold, a story was made. The words came easy, for the first time. Also for the first time, I felt an emotional connection to the characters. I had created characters I really cared about, and that was an important step for me. And although I'd hate to add another ""first"", it was also the first time I stuck to certain basic writing rules, like using all five senses in your descriptions, and giving your readers some idea of what the characters looked like.

It was a good story, and I was happy with it.

When I was done with it, I made a decision. I was going to sit down and come up with the greatest novel idea ever. <i>Ever</i>. I write down some basic thoughts:

""Gods rule people; influence affairs subtely; war between gods; one of them brings person back from the dead""

""Gods and mortals. Nearly dead guy is taken?/revived? by gods. Need him to defeat other god. Gets companion somehow. Mortals have problem that connects, need mc. Gods send replacement, eventually group rebels against him he tries to stop them from interfering with mc's mission.""

That's what it started with. I created a small text file, and over the course of five months, I wrote down every thought I had about the story. Every neat little idea I wanted to include, every strange twist that would be cool to write. The list grew. After a while, I sat down and managed to pull six coherent story lines from the mess I had created. Then, I wrote down a single line for every scene I wanted to write for each storyline. When that was done, I shuffled them all together, and my outline was finished. On 8 October 2003, I started writing my next novel.

After more than a year, my wordcount is less than promising. I went through several phases in which I was not very productive, and my laziness bit me solidly in the rear end. I'm not satisfied with the amount I've written... But what I have is awesome. With this new writing-in-the-mornings routine and the included improvement in word count, I hope to have this one finished in less than <i>another</i> year. The final wordcount is expected to be at about 140-150K... So I have some work to do.

A sorcerer finds a new respect with the army he must protect; an old soldier is faced with feelings he thought dead; a father is pitted against his son in the fight to decide the fate of an entire city; a leader of an underground cult devoted to the Gods finds himself questioning his fate when he needs it the most; a girl with a talent for the sword must work to repair an error she didn't know she made, for the sake of the master she thought dead; and a swordsman who ended his own life to save the world finds himself revived and presented with a task that may cost him his soul. As an outcast God makes his bid for vengeance against his kin, these fates are inexorably drawn together to a climax where the existence of all the worlds is at stake.

Probably lame and cliched. But I had fun putting that together. :P"

Write every day. That's the mantra, the guideline, the golden rule, the first commandment.

Okay, I exaggerate. But it's still important. See, I don't consider myself a person who writes for fun on the side. It's the career I'm aiming for. ""This is my <b>job</b>! I take it <i>seriously</i>, man!"" (Anyone who doesn't know Pablo Fransisco, be enlightened and find his stuff somewhere. Anywhere. You will be in danger of death by laughter.)

Back to topic. So, writing every day. Unless you do, you'll tend to think of writing as a hobby. Something you can decide not to do. Something that can wait. But it's <i>not</i>. Because some day, you're going to be up to your nosehairs in deadlines, and you'll have to work, and hard, too. If I want to be a professional writer, I must teach myself to write every day. And I will.

I used to be a regular nightowl. Staying up until 4 AM was common (as was getting up at 1 PM as a result), and I even pulled an all-nighter or two. I used to be very pleased with the image of the writer sitting alone behind his desk, writing when everyone else was asleep. Except I didn't really do any writing during those endless nights. Instead, all I did was play games on my PC or, for the past six months or so, talk to mi amor either by phone or MSN. So that wasn't really working. I did try to write at times, usually when guilt came knocking, but I often found I was far, far too tired. Nothing would come out, and the few words I managed to agonise out of my dessicated grey matter were horrible, painful to read, and extraordinary only in the degree of suckanacitatiousness.

On 15 October, I flew to the US to meet my love for the first time. The four weeks we spent together made me happier than I knew humans could be. After that time, I had to go back again, for a while longer at least. Saying goodbye was the hardest and most painful thing I ever did. But the above is not what this entry is about. Once I got back. I found that, as a result of jetlag, I got tired very quickly in the evenings, and I was ready to get up in the mornings at 6 AM. At first, I was thoroughly annoyed. I figured my schedule was going to be all messed up; never mind the fact that I <i>had</i> no schedule. But reading another writer's weblog (Holly Lisle, whom I greatly admire--see link to her site to your left) brought to my attention the fact that *shock* I can write in the mornings, too!

I tried it.

And never before has the writing been so easy. Never have the words come so fast that they seem not to flow but to burst from my fingers to spread onto the page. For the first time in a long while, writing doesn't feel like I'm trying to bring down the Kremlin with my cranium anymore. Less frustration, less self-recrimination, less worrying about what talent I may or may not possess. Instead, more words, better words, more ideas...

I'm at about 70K now; when I started writing in the mornings I was at 65K. 5K in 8 days is very good for me. If I can keep this up, maybe it won't take me <i>another</i> year to finish this book.

The moral of the story? ...You figure it out. I just write it; you get to make sense of it, if you're so inclined."

So she tells me, ""You should start a journal.""

A journal. Why the heck not?

For me to feel comfortable with such a thing, however, I must feel it serves a purpose of some kind. Otherwise, I just feel like a self-important little prick. Which, perhaps, I am, but that's besides the point entirely.

Thus, I plan to log here, the progress I make on my novel, future novels, short stories, short story submissions, and should I at times feel so inclined, whatever ramblings pour from my hands onto this sorely tested keyboard.

Will anyone read it? Well, two people will. One being my heart's companion and the other being myself. Yes, I am going to read my own journal. Sue me.

So, watch this space. Exciting tales and perhaps *gasp* snippets of Works In Progress soon to follow.

...or something."

"event","Yesterday... went to Lazor Tag! Im not going to lie, that place is pretty gay unless you are like 6. I went with Alexis, Leah, Justin, Brandon, and Michael. There was at least 4 different birthday parties going on and like 10 lil 6 year olds would gang up on you and just keep shooting you. Eventually Alexis became my body sheild. That was pretty much the best part. But I dont think that we'll be going back there. 

Today - I went out to lunch with Bryan, Rachael and Greg. Greg was being an asshole to me the whole entire time. But when a guy orders a Greek Taco Pita... you're just asking to be laughed at. Yeah, they were being dirty but I got over it. 
Then I drove all the way out to waterford to ""watch"" michael bowl. He didnt get to, it was kind of sad and he looked real upset. But they won so that was sweet. Oh man can Jeremy bowl! Then there were these crazy boys from another school just yelling and cheering. Oh man, they were funny. 

Tonight I might go out with michael... but I got some homework to get done first."

"event","Thursday: Went to greg's party, it was ok. Michael wasnt feeling that good. We watched Elf but we couldnt hear or see anything because there was so many people in there. I got into a tickle fight with michael. Then we ganged up on rachael and she really started to spaz out. It was kind of Crazy. I felt kind of weird there because it was gregs house and everything... Him being the Ex, Michael and I being there together. I dont know. Kind of strange. I kept feeling like I was being watched or something. Lauren was being kind of strange taking pictures of me every second. I dont know why she was trying to hide it because I knew that she was taking them. Oh well I dont really care. 

Friday: Michael came over for a little while after I was done babysitting. I made 40 dollars that night. 10 dollars a hour isnt that bad. Well michael came over and we watched Bad Boys II. It was a funny movie! 

Saturday: Chirstmas Eve! I went to my Aunt Lori's house. Everyone got drunk. Nick and I exchanged gifts this year. I wraped his present in a tin can, nailed it shut, wrapped it, put it in a tampon box, wrapped that, put that in a shoe box and duck taped it and then wrapped that, put that box into a bigger box. duck taped the whole entire box and wrapped it with like ten layers of wrapping paper. He had such a hard time opening the present. This year we had a 26 dollar limit... yeah it got cut in half 2 times. so he worked really hard for 26 dollars. Nick got me a shirt from abercrombie and fitch and my aunt got me a leatard for dance class. Oh and we opened all of our presents when we got home.

Sunday: Chistmas! Got up opened some stuff in my stocking. Didnt have any presents under the tree since we opened them all up the day before. I got a Skagen watch, some rings, Berkinstock shoes, a clicker for my TV (remote control) and a bucn of clothes and some marching band pictures. It was nice. I got everything that I wanted except for socks! Michael got me a night out on the town (dinner in greektown and tickets to the red wings game) Hes such a sweety. And he got me a picture of him and I from over the summer and a little teddy bear.  Well then I went to church, then off to my aunt vicky's house. They have this 10 dollar gift exchange every year. My uncle jim always brings the funniest presents. This year he brought 10 loafs of bread with a jar of peanut butter and jelly. It was so funny. 

Monday: shopping and to see ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" with Michael it was ok

Tuesday: Michael and sean came over at like 1 and we made a pie, watched a movie and went putt putting.

Wed: My dad had a few people over, he made a ham, watched the michigan football game, Michael came over for a little bit to eat some food, and then I went over to his house to watch a movie with his mom and his dad. BATMAN BEGINS I really liked it. Mr and Mrs. Sorrentino got me this fat little stuffed snowman that looked like michael when he was a baby. Its the cutest thing in the whole world. 

Today I think that Michael and I are going to go to the rolladium... but I dont know. So I was being kind of OCD today. Doing everything three times before I moved on to do somthing else. My mom started laughing at me and telling me how she was going to send me to the funny farm. I knew what I was doing but i was just so bored."

I kind of feel bad because compared to what he got me, my presents to him  were pretty damn crappy. He was a hard person to shop for. Plus, I told him that I really didnt want anything for christmas... and I really wasnt expecting anything. But when he came over today to give me my present. I was so excited to find out what it was. HE'S TAKING ME OUT ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY, TO DETROIT, TO A RED WINGS GAME! AHHHH, I've always wanted to go to a live game! I've never really been to one. Chris Cheleos is my favorite, but thats because I know him. My cousin AJ plays hockey with his son. This is really the best present that I have ever gotten. Just the fact that he put so much thought into it, I cant believe that he would do something like that for me. I cant even discribe how I fell right now. I love him so much! 

I have to go shopping to buy him something else."

Friday: Michael and I pretty much spent the whole weekend together. We went sleding at the high school late at night that was fun. He hit his head on the fence of the baseball fields.
Saturday: I took my road test. I got 5 points of parking and 12 points on driving. AND DOING IT IN THE SNOW IS PRETTY GOOD FOR WHAT I GOT! I didnt get home till about 1:30 am. Went to Michaels house to watch some freaky movie that made me laugh a little. We went to white castle and I had my first burger there. It was good... but I thought that it was greasy but oh well. 
Sunday: I made Michael get up at like 9 in the morning so that he can go to church with me. He's pretty much the greatest. Later we went to Hero's to have lunch. The ribs were good. We went back home, and hung out for a little while. Went to Michael's house to do some homework... didnt get it all done but thats ok. After that, I had dinner at their house and we came back to my house to watch ""Cinderella man"" It was ok but I almost fell asleep. 
Oh yeah and I got my computer back too! So I can talk to everyone on line again! Whoo hoo! This weekend was the best!"

I got a job at Cold Stone with Allee... but my mom things that I should find one closer because rignt now it's like 10 miles away. So thats like an hours pay to get there and back. Damn it makes me mad because I really want to work there! 

Went to Holland this weekend. My brother had a hockey thing. It was pretty cool. He won a shoot out (62 MPH), then he leads in the amount of penalties in his league... we thought that he was going to go the whole weekend without getting in the box... but no. He saved it all up for the last game and got in the box two times in less then 3 minutes. The first time was a good one. It was for charging a kid... which i guess is bad but oh well. yeah after they blew the horn or whatever they called it he started a fight. I started laughing and my mother told me that it wasnt funny.

Then there was this little boy there named Dylen. He was so cute. If you asked him what he wanted for christmas he would say "" a blue unbrella"". His mom told me that collects spatulas and has actually slept with a potato smusher! hahahhaaha. then he played basketball with all the trash in the stands and he would be at the very top of then and then throw it down, giggle a little, go and pick it up and throw it in the trash. It was the cutest thing in the world.

"event","Yesterday was AMAZING! 

Todd danced in a Bra
Michael sat with me on my bus
We had Chicken
We had Pizza
The South Lyon Drum Major is effing hot! No lie, Leah and I went to say hi before awards. And the other Drum Majors (the girl ones, that were next to us in line) helped us meet another hot Drum Major from Milford... Damn, who would know that Band people are hot... I mean besides Michael.
Singing on the bus. 
Knowing that there wasnt anymore Color Guard practices... kind of sad but at least my body wont hurt anymore. 
Cuddling with Michael
I love him. 
We got 10th place but it doent matter, being down there for awards was the best thing in the world!
I'm going to miss it, but at least I get to see everyone at school still. 

I'll post pictures later once i find the damn cord."

"event","States are tomorrow and I'm going to cry because I love guard and all my marching band friends! And most of all the crazy bus rides.... 
The last performance of the season is tomorrow, and the last practice was yesterday. I cant believe that I'm a senior and that I'm not coming back next year. I almost cried today when the seniors went around passing out roses to all of our underclassman.

"event","Well... yesterday really kicked us in the ass. but hey, its only two points! Its not really our fault anyways! They cant expect us to do better when they take the whole last song and change everything two days before we perform. But I thought that it was one of my best performaces, and thats all that really matters. I didnt fall, and I didnt drop my flag! So I was happy. I got the last broccoli soup too! I sat with michael. I couldnt stop laughing because he couldnt stop burping. I went out for awards and froze my ass off too! Nick, Nate, Justin, Leah, Katie, and I decided that we're going to do a ""Wave"" for awards next week! Its going to be sweet. 

After that was all over with... OMG the bus ride home was great! Seniors in the back being dirty! Taking pictures, Adrienne and Zac doing only god knows what, Justin being all cranky, Zac being just funny, and Leah getting spanked by Jeremy. It was the best night ever! Then there is Josh telling me that I have to be a good girlfriend. HA, too bad I dont have a boyfriend to be good to! Then Josh said ""what does that mean"" 
""I dont know Josh, for all I know I'm just someone that he makes out with""
""But you're his girlfriend arnt you?"" 
""Umm... sure?""
""you mean he hasnt even asked you yet?... So basically he just assumes that you're his girlfriend""
""Basically...""
""so you kind of are and you kind of arnt?"" 
""Well see josh... since he hasnt asked me to be his gf... that means that I can just go and make out with anyone because he hasnt asked for that commitment""
""YOU WOULD REALLY DO THAT TO HIM?""
""fuck no, I like michael!"" 

Besides having boy craziness going on... bus rides are the best! AND THIS TIME WE DIDNT HAVE TO SIT WITH THE DAMN DRUMMERS..."

"event","When you fell like you've been fucked over in everything that you worked so hard for... and you put everything else to the side (like all your homework) and then at the last minute they change everything, it feels like you have nothing to show for it. I used to care, until people... who are rookies decided that seniors arn't cool, and they dont mean anything... even if they are a section leader... but that doesnt mean anything. 

I remember when I was a freshamn, we respected the upper classman. We didnt think twice if they told us to do something. If they told us to do something we did it, without complaning or having a little section of underclassman trying to rebel because we had respect for our upperclassman. THAT YEAR WE MADE IT TO STATES, and we didnt even try. But now, If a senior wants the underclassman to do something for the benefit of them... they basically say ""eff that, Im not doing that. you cant tell me what to do, you're not my mom, ive been working just as hard as you have... if not harder."" WELL YOU KNOW WHAT.... IN THE GUARD, THE SENIORS ARE YOUR MOMS! And what we say, usually goes! 
Too much drama has been going on in guard the past few weeks.... and now that so much has changed... and i wasnt even there to learn what changed because i was at a funneral home crying because Grandma Betty died... I COULD SERIOUSLY CARE LESS NOW! If i could, I would hand in my poles, and spend my time bringing up my unaccepted grade in AP Biology, and try to go to bed before 2am and see how it makes me feel in the morning! But i cant because then ill fail band too... and if you fail band that means that there is something seriously wrong with you! I just wish one day that I wouldnt wake up with bags under my eyes, and then have some random girls come up to me in the hall complaning about guard... Ive tried too hard to just keep all my anger inside of me, and just deal with all the changes... but you know what, I CANT BE A LEADER IF PEOPLE WONT LET ME BE! and im pretty sure that every senior in guard feels the same way. So for now on, keep your crap at the door, and just come to guard and do what is told. Thats what they told me freshamn year and ive sticked to it for the most part. Dont let wally and mr. lewis get to you, and just have fun for the rest of the year. I joined guard not just for a grade in band... but because i have a blast being with all of you girls and basically kicking ass. But color guard is taking over my  life... and becoming something that i dont want to do. So lets just make it fun again and forget about the competition part... even though thats kind of a big deal... ok lets try to do both."

BRING IT FROM HOME OR GO FIND ONE IN THE GUARD ROOM THAT ISNT USED, OR ASK SOMEONE IF YOU CAN BORROW IT. 

DONT GO THROUGH PEOPLES SHIT WHEN THEY ARE PASSING OUT AWARDS FREEZING THEIR ASSES OFF!

AND I WANT MY CLOAK BACK, and if I keep getting fucked over like this at every damn practice and at every damn thing that we have to do then im just going to hand in my poles and say fuck this... back to AP Biology homework!"

"event","This year had to be the best homecoming ever! I went with michael. Pictures were taken at my house, I was late because of my hair appointment. I told people to start coming at 4:30, I got there at 4:20 and there was people parked up and down waldon. AHHh We had chinese... I got General Tao's (it was so hot), and I ended up sharing it with michael and nate. Then as I was walking out I saw JJ and we got a picture together! She looked so cute in her green dress. I took a walk to CVS with Sarah to get some eye liner... we got sone funny looks walking in there all dolled up. Then at the dance... Oh that was fun. Justin ""you should be looking at her beautiful face!"" haha that was funny. Michael wasnt a very good dancer, but he told me before. I thought it was cute... but I laughed on the inside. He was just standing there and then I started freaking on him. It opened him up some more and he danced! I was so proud of him. Even if he isnt the best dancer in the world. I still had a blast going with him.
Greg though... I dont know what he was doing, he was making up some really interesting moves... haha! I guess him and Jewlie kissed each other and then he was all confused what to do on Monday. I told him that I was happy for him, and to just talk to her. Oh well, he's a big boy, I'm sure things between them will happen. They always seemed good for each other. 
This year was the best, I didnt dance with michael the whole time, because I wanted to dance with the girls. But I always came back. We kissed each other for the first time, it was so romantic. Brandon kept coming up to Michael and I to inform us when some guy would change dancing with someone... AHH I dont care! Then I was yelling at him, telling him to go dance with someone. I saw him dancing with Kayla to a slow song... it looked like he had to pee. Michael and I left like a half hour before the dance was over to miss traffic. It was cold outside so he gave me his jacket, it was the sweetest thing ever! Brandon came with us... Oh well. We Got to Ryan's house...those boys are crazy! Gas+ boys= big mess! so we thought... they couldnt get the thing started! I changed in the driveway... it was kind of tough but i managed. Then I spent most the night talking to michael around the fire. Hes a good kisser! Then when we were getting ready to go home... someone was talking about getting laid. So I said ""ok Michael, ready to go get Laid"" I was kidding of course but when we left all those guys were screaming ""whoot whoot"" and sarah was like... ""guys, she was kidding"". He took me home, We were freezing! He walked me to the door and kissed me goodnight. It was the best time ever. 
Then once I got in the house i realized that I had his shirt because it was the same color as my coat and I left my camera in his car. So, on monday when I went back to school i gave his shirt back to him and he game me my camera... and Justin and Chris were shocked. and they were saying things like ""did it really happen"" haha. I thought that it was funny. Michael and I just smiled at each other and didnt say anything. 
That was by far the best homecoming ever!"

"event","Well I was talking to Bryan at powderpuff and last night... Its strange because the past two days it seemed like he was trying to tell me that greg wanted me back and that he really misses me... 

Personally, I think that he is full of crap! We broke up like half a year ago... HE BROKE UP WITH ME! I moved on, and I found someone else that I really really really like ...MICHAEL SORRENTINO! Plus, even if I wasn't dating Michael right now, I probably wouldn't go back to Greg anyways. Him and I are starting to talk to each other again, and it's not like I befriended him, for the most part. GERRR I wish that Bryan would just leave the whole thing in the past where it was left. There is no reason to bring it up now. Michael is the greatest! The end. 

So, basically they just suck at life! Get over it and move on! I DID"

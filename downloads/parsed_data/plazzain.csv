So, I am writing my statement of purpose essay for gradschool, and damn does it suck - writing the paper and the paper itself. You just end up sounding like some sort of pompous asshole lol. Blargh

"event","Well, today was my first day of school. It was kinda tiring getting into the groove once again, but I'll be alright after a few days. I'm still not used to walking around and listening to someone lecture me on .. err... stuff lol

I got to see all my friends and that was good. We're all getting ready for our gradschool and stuff, and it seems I am real ahead of a lot of them. Most of them haven't even taken their GRE's, which is making their schedule real tight. I guess I'm plain far ahead of the game. I guess planning this out ahead of time was a real good idea because it seems I have a lot of time to get my applications in.

Well, today was kind of relaxed. No real work was assigned; classes mainly consisted of some review and minor discussion, nothing really major. I guess we're all still getting used to the swing of things heh heh :)

It's nice, I can relax and have some fun tonight instead of already working on homework :P"

"event","So, I woke up early this morning, ate my cereal and kinda just sat there. I reflected a lot in my semi-awake state; trying to get my bearings and figure out what I was going to do. My mom gave me a hug and then I went off to take my exam. The drive there was pleasant enough and before ya know it I had filled out all the proper paper work and was starting.

The essays were so damned easy; ohh man, so freaking simple and straight forward. I couldn't have asked for anything better then those two gems. I finished both of them in under 20 minutes, and was able to revise and kinda nap there for a while. Next came the verbal section; it killed me. Damn was it hard. None of the practice exams were as hard as that section @@

The quantitative section was equally as brutal. Some of those questions were just out there. A lot of them were easy, but there were 5 of them which were plain funky. I thought I had lost it around question 20, and almost gave up. Luckily I didn't

Finally came the research section, which I honestly did not want to do. Because the damn thing wouldn't let me get out of it - which it said I could do, but wouldn't allow me to when I asked to - I just picked random answers. Serves them right =P

I felt kinda bad around that time; I wasn't confident in my scores. I kinda had that nervous stomach feeling where your abdomen feels like a rock, and your bowels feel like they are going to let loose. Argh, it felt like I was gonna pee my pants. Next thing ya know, the heart was racing as I clicked the screen and found my scores.....Phew, I got a perfect quant score and excellent verbal

I jumped out of my seat and ran out of the test room........sat in my car for a while and just relaxed and smiled. It felt so gooooood ^______________________________________^"

"event","Wow, summer has come and gone; school is here once again, starting tommorrow. Well, I really enjoyed this summer. I learned a lot, gained some excellent skills, and found new faith and confidence in myself. It is senior year of my undergraduate college experience - the last year, the final year - I wonder how my skills and abilities shall stack up. I've been improving upon them since highschool, learned and excelling so that I may get better and enable life to become easier.

I am still worried, perhaps just nervous. There are always those uncertainties, and sometimes the more worse certainties. I know there will be days when I shall be nervous and balked. Sometimes the work will be stacked against me and overflowing, but I'll be fine. Whatever comes my way shall be handled swiftly. I can overcome anything, PERIOD! It's healthy to be nervous - a bit anxious and excited.

My schedule is stacked in favor of a good test; I'm taking classes which my highschool self would have had nightmares about, but now I shall see how easy the challenge will be. I'm looking forward to school, seeing my friends, and the challenges that await. A culmination of several years, I wonder what will happen."

"event","So tommorrow is my GRE exam; I wonder how many people it haunts everyday, causing them to experience sleepless nights and hours of anxiety. It's an important exam, and yet it isn't. You need it to make that valuable first cut into gradschool, but after that it is completely meaningless beyond the realm of cocktail parties and common bragging. How troublesome.

I'm not really afraid or anxious to take the exam, I'm more anxious to just get it over with. I have a whole month of complete bliss waiting for me over the horizon, and once that exam is out of the way I'm going to enjoy it. The only thing between me and my vacation is that test, that damned test. I want it out of my way, finished.

I've always depised these exams; always done not as well as expected because of my poor test taking abilities. That's all changed though. Things click more readily then they did before, what used to be cloudy is now pellucid XD... Ohh GRE word.>Snap!

College really had made me smarter and more well rounded. I have so many more systems, so many more methods with which to solve problems with. Everything has grown so much easier and understandable in such a short amount of time. It feels, good.

I know I can do well on it; my several practice exams indicate that I can destroy this exam easily, but I still have my reservations. I need to be careful - to be calm and calculated in everything - and must fight off that urge inside of me to speed on by the exam like lightning. I know I am fast, but with my speed comes the occasional error and I want to keep those to a minimum. My strategy is solid: be careful, be calm, but don't be slow. Read each question carefully, figure out the answer, and the reread it again so as to cover all bases. If you don't know it, then guess. 

Funny thing is the exam really isn't that hard, if anything it is easy. Everything is right up my alley, and there will be no surprises. I can do excellent, and I know I will. I'll sleep well tonight, wake up early and then head off for 4 hours of relaxed testing. I'll stuff a couple of energy bars down my throat and drown em down with some water somewhere around 11 >.>

Then...It's relaxation time ^_^... I haven't been able to relax like that for so long... I just can't wait..It'll feel so good to be lazy for once."

Today was my last day of work; funny, that it also turned out to be my most hectic one as well. I was doing some cost analysis for the project I was working on when i get a new e-mail. Turns out I had to calculate the cost per cubic foot of storage per annum. I dashed to the engineering building and stole some blue prints of the office, and then started using my tape measure to calculate all the different storage units. 

A few hours later and some number crunching and I finally got all my information. The secretaries then treated me to bagels and pizza, and some coke ^_^.. Mmmm free food.. yum

I then found some statistical variables for the rest of data I was working on and then I had to go. I shook everyone's hand and then left. It felt kind of good to have all that work lifted off my shoulders ^^"

My boss was real happy to see me again. I was real happy I could find a good solution for the problem. Everyone seemed real impressed, and it kinda felt nice to just go back to work and feel useful. It's nice to slack off during the summer, but I guess I was feeling a bit too lazy heh heh.

My boss was really nice; he exemplified many of the qualities I identify with when I picture a good leader. My intern boss was also pleasant to work with. She was very interesting, and always had something to talk about.

Overall, I think my performance was quite good. I came in early, left on time, stayed late when needed and completeled all my projects on time. My boss seemed pleased with my work, and I was also ready for whatever he threw my way. I improved in the areas of communication and decisive planning, and my creativity has blown straight through the roof. My ability to think quickly has really refined as well.

It was a good internship overall. I learned a lot and gained some good skills along the way. Also, I'm getting pizza tommorrow O_O!!

"event","Hmmm, it seems school is about to start once again. Good ol school; last year of my undergraduate studies. My undergraduate experience has been good for me. I started off fresh - highschool was over, and with it the tribulations which went with it - feeling like an adult, and no longer like a squawky teenager. I felt kind of grown up, as I walked around with the rest of my fellow classmates and pretended to be all mannerly. I still laugh today, how we all shook hands so eagerly as we gave off this unsure bravado. We all must have looked so stuipid. Ughhh I just look at the real world on mtv and roll my eyes because that is how it all seemed. All this talk about ""growth"" and ""being a better person"". I sometimes wondered if the people I met were merely robots with a few programmed catch phrases. 

Semesters went by; I dug myself back into my shell and focused on my studies. I just didn't feel there was genuine understanding behind everything. It seemed people were behaving a certain way because they thought they had to, not because they wanted to. Funny thing was they really didn't even know how to do it, and hence made it seem so forced and odd. So I removed myself from it, and simply glazed on by.

My old tendencies came out: worrying about grades and my goal of perfection. I began overanalyzing things too much, and with it came a very rigid demeanor. I hated being inconvenienced and having my schedule interrupted. But then again things were alright for the most part; I was lonely, but my grades were good and I was doing alright.

Then junior year came, and I finally had to choose what I was going to do. I at first thought it was computer science, but quickly found how boring that discipline was. It was easy, but terribly frustrating and boring, so I looked towards math. Good ol math, the subject I was always good at because I was always better then the average joe at it. I could have done history, god knows I am a master at it; I could have done psychology, am I ever amazing in that; no, I chose math because there are plain more job oppurtunities with it.

Math.... good ol....scary as fuck...math. And then I took that class, that fateful horrible class, introduction to proofs. My god was it scary; the first time I ever found myself - and the rest of my classmates - with the looks of dumbfounded stuipidity on their faces. I've had my fair share of insanely hard courses, but that one took the cake. I never remember being so lost - or ever being lost for that matter - and frustrated. It was like learning how to talk by reading; completely alien and new to me. My fellow classmates did not fair any better. It was just so damned hard, as it was the first time any of us had to solve something from basic barebone rules. It was like nothing we ever had to do before, and it stumped us all.

I'll admit, I was scared. I've been fearful of classes before - I rememeber when the adrenaline used to rush before test time - but this was a whole new ball game. Before I knew I could at least get 2/3 of the questions right easy, and that I was only fighting for an A, not for a passing grade. In intro to proofs it was different: I was fighting for my life; I had never fought to pass a class before, never. I went into that class knowing I could get 0 questions right on an exam. ZERO! That's scary, very very scary. To know you might not know how to do anything, what does that say? It makes you feel pathetic - useless! Your confidence flushes out of you, squeezed out like a water from a soaked sponge. That empty feeling then comes, followed by confusion and uncertainty. We all know what humans are like when that happens, we become scared and irrational. We either cling to what we know, avoid the situation alltogether, or delve in deeper. I choose to avoid it.

Funny thing is I got an A- in that class anyways, but I still did not believe in myself. My confidence was shattered; I no longer believed in myself. I figured I had finally reached my limit; mathematics was really beyond my grasp. It was game over, I really wasn't as special as I thought I was. And this devastated me; I always believed myself to be able to handle anything, and for the first time I couldn't. I couldn't do it, I had actually been beaten and bested soundly.

So I escaped; paddling about in applied math and actuarial science. I did well, even managed to get an A in another ridiculous class. It felt good, real good, and I was confident once again. It wasn't proofs, but here was another hard class which stumped everyone all the same, and I managed to actually survive it quite well this time. Problem was, during that time I got my first taste of real stress; I didn't know it at the time, but I developed an allergy sometime during the spring. How unpleasant. Those headaches it gave me - i had never had headaches before in my life - but now, there was this unyielding dull pain in my head. I hated it - damn it all, it would not go away. My brain felt like it was slowly being crushed in someone's hands; squeezed slowly and painfully, to the point where I couldn't even study. Everytime I read or tried to learn my mind shot through with this horrible pain.................

My ability to study, my claim to fame. Hard work; the hard working genius, that was me. I was a genius of hard work, able to work work work and work - until death if need be - in order to get the job done. And I did, ohhh did I ever know how to bust my ass. I knew in the baack of my mind working hard was the one thing that could always turn the tables, least in school. But here I was, unable to work. My ability to study was stripped from me - STOLEN!

Unknown to me, the allergies were doing this and causing me to have a hard time breathing. I remember walking out of class one day, grabbing onto my chest as I gasped for air and slumped to the floor. I felt so helpless at that moment, and hated it. I wanted it to all go away, but couldn't - it only made it worse, my wish to get rid of that it is. My heart pounded - I thought I was having a heart attack as it raced. I wasn't though, it was just stress. I saw the doctor, but it didn't go away until around May.

Lucky for me too, very lucky. I was able to finish the semester and get an A in all courses. Amazing, I missed an entire month of classes yet ratted out with A's. Unbelievable performance, almost unheard of. But I did it, and my confidence returned to me. I believed in myself again, kinda.

I decided to face my fears, and took real analysis - the paragon of all proof classes in math in my University. Funny thing was, I did it. I handled the class; proofs, the once fairy taled monster of my life, were suddenly no longer a threat. I defeated them! I surpassed them! It felt good, so good. There was nothing I couldn't do now, how calming........

But then something happened; my grandfather died, and then my aunt a week later.How much stress I was under; and to tip it all off, my headaches came back. It was too much. My mind was overloaded, especially after studying 14 hours everyday for one week. I had reached my limit, for real this time, and my mind let  me have it. After a year of horrid stress, I woke up one morning fatigued and took an exam. At first I was fine, everything was going well. Then it happened, this dreadful feeling of fatigue. My mind felt so heavy; it was like it had become a rock, and that I wasn't able to do anymore. I had only done 2 questions out of 10; if I stopped now I would fail....Then it happened....I snapped.

It only took 1 second; all these thoughts, terrible thoughts, flushed through my mind. ""You're gonna fail"", ""You won't graduate"", ""You won't get into grad school"", ""You won't get a job"", ""You'll be poor"", ""You'll DIE!""...This warmth flushed over me, blanketing my body with an eerie numbness that caused my heart and lungs to stop. I fell from my chair and staggered out of the room, gasping for air as I slumped to the ground. I had had a panic attack; me, after lasting with a year of constant stress I had broken down.

I never felt so scared in my life; i thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. I felt like I was dieing after all. That eerie sense of fear; I felt so damned scared and alone, like I was being attacked and watched by a predator. I didn't know what to do, and just sat there trying to get my bearings back. Luckily, I did; my mind wouldn't allow me to fail. I grabbed myself and dragged myself back in, angry that I'd dare be taken advantage like that. I finished the test, and got an excellent score.

Yet the damage had been done, the months of stress had chemically altered my brain. I couldn't deal with stress anymore, and found myself horrified by irrational thoughts. I was howled and abused by my own irrational fears; I felt like a victim and captive. Life became scary, there was no joy in it anymore just fear.

I went for help, got psychological treatment, but they couldn't help me. Words can't fix a chemical imbalance in the mind. I couldn't sleep; I became tired, no, exhausted. I felt like I was dieing, genuinely dieing. I couldn't sleep, causing me to wander around during the day like a zombie. Doubts flooded my head and I was even considering quitting school......But I wouldn't! No, I wouldn't give up. I argued that it was a spell, and finally went to my doctor for some final help. I didn't want drugs, but I argued it was my only choice. Psychological help failed; facing my demons failed; what else was left?

So I saw him, and he reassured me. Bless my doctor; he informed me that my case was entirely ordinary, and that all I needed to do was take this one pill. So I did, and I was cured. Slowly, but surely I got better.    How sweet it feels; how lovely life is, no more fear and worry. I can control my thoughts, my worries, and my emotions once again. It felt so good: control! I bless god everyday, thank you for this, I'll never forget. And I won't, I will never forget what it felt like being at the bottom of life - fighting for survival. I had some rough and low times, but I made it. I DIDN'T QUIT!

And so here I am; enjoying every moment of life, even its tribulations. Obstacles are no longer obstacles, they are challenges - challenges I can fulfill and overcome. Sure, it will be hard, but I can do it. I can overcome anything now; I know this. I know how to avoid another panic attack; I learned from the past, and have corrected the mistakes which I so dearly needed to change......And I grew...Grew into a different and better person.

Life seems so nice now as the loose ends become wrapped up. It at one time looked so ambigious, so scary. Now, nothing scares me; I look forward to what challenges await me. I look forward to overcome them, learn from them, and grow once again. This time I won't have to hit the bottom of the barrel, this time I shall do it right. It's so nice, seeing that open path streched out before me for once. I now have an idea as to what I have to do. things are finally coming together. It's been a long journey, but things are finally coming together."

"event","Sometimes I honestly believe some people are just meant to not be happy for their entire lives. I've been watching a few of my friends, and they really just mess up all their excellent oppurtunities. They've really landed some really excellent scores, and then worry about it. They worry constantly that they'll lose them or not be worthy of them, and eventually defeat themselves and give up. They don't even try and just resign themselves to a loss. It almost boggles my mind that they actually let themselves defeat themselves like that, it just doesn't help."

"event","I went to a BBQ today. My friend hosted it and it was good :)

We had hamburgers, corn and hotdogs. My friend almost had a grill fire, but other then that it was all good. I also introduced him to emulators and roms. Man, he is a senior in college and he did not know what roms and emulators were. That is completely unfair people, so I had to make up for it by introducing it to him.

"event","Well, Cherry and Tenebrae have been on my case this week to post, so here we go.

Today was a pretty good day. I went to a spot in the country where they give out free mulch, and bagged an entire garbage bag of these dark brown leafy mulch stuff. The stuff was ridiculously thick; I needed to stab at it with some archaic fork like device in order to separate it and bag it. When I got back I placed the rich material onto my flower and vegetable garden - and I have to say - it looked pretty good. I am pleased with how everything turned out, it all looks good.

I seem to really like doing yard work lately. I think it is being outside in the fresh air, it seems to really make me feel energized. The sun also seems to do something to me, other then burn my skin. I dunno, it was just nice mowing my lawn and gardening outside today.

Gardening is not the only thing I've been doing since break. With all this free time on my hands I have been cleaning and dragging stuff out of our storage. I sound bored right, lol. I found an old soloflex in our storage basement (Holy shit) and dragged the thing back into living basement. I cleaned it off and then stared dumbfoundly at it. I have always used free weights, but had recently come to the conclusion that they just weren't doing the job. My muscular build just hadn't changed no matter what I did, and they seemed to injure me all the time. So here I was, with my new machine, and began using it. I followed their exercise guide, and after two weeks of using the machine I can say that it does indeed work. I found this out when one of my shirts all of sudden felt really tight. I inspected myself and noticed my overal build had grown slightly, and that I was more toned. Wooohooo!

Work has been pretty awesome. I really like all my fellow employees, and I seem to handle a lot of the work handed to me very well. Everyone has seemed relatively impressed with me, so I find that good. My project is to revamp the city hall site in order to make it more cost efficient for the budget. Challenging, and ohh my god, the laws involved @@"

Third is the consolation, at least you got there.

For some reason, no one gives a shit about second place. You're the loser who just couldn't seem to push quite hard enough."

"event","There are some nights, where my life feels like I'm bailing out the boat with a thimble. Hell, I don't even know why I'm writing this now, I usually just delete this shit anyway. Main reason why my blogspot is so empty. I guess I just feel like ranting to LJ tonight. 

It's like drowning, I guess. It's not like falling. When you're falling, at least you have some sort of direction, and you see the ground coming. Lots of dread time, but you know when it's coming. The rollercoaster metaphor isn't appropriate either. At least there, you've got the tracks and you know that it'll end in a bit- you just have to hang on tight.

Have you ever drowned? When you scramble and flail desperately to keep yourself above the water. You can't breathe, and you don't know which way to go. There's light though. There's some measure of hope. But personally, I find that it's this little glimmer that makes you desperate. It's the one that makes the experience all the worse. 

I mean, when you know the shit's coming, you can commit to it. You just grit your teeth, smile, and meet it head on. 

But when it taunts you like that? When you're all tired and weary, and it offers you some sort of hope? Like a sucker, you bite. Because you're desperate for any respite.

You bite. Hard. And then you feel the hook go through."

"event","Because sir I am an insensitive cretin, first-class. I wish it was just as easy to stop as it was to say it out loud. But then you're past halfway through everything when your eyes widen and you realize what the fuck it is you're doing again, and by then it's too late and you've hurt someone you'd never want to hurt, and in the process feel like shit.

Then you disappear again for weeks on end clogging your mind with smoke and fantasies, conversations that will never take place, things that will never happen, and then here we are again.

My problem is that i have just enough brains to get what i want but not enough to know to stop."

"event","I *am* fucking chill. I'm fucking chill almost every day. I take all the shit you dump on me, and smile. Everytime you lash out, I take it on the chin, and ask you if you want to do it again.

Admittedly, I have short fuse. The slightest thing sets me off. I am possibly one of the hottest heads I know, but I long ago learned not to let it get the better of me.

But when something finally ticks me off- which is rare nowadays- You tell me to fucking *chill.* That's the best you have? I want to believe that you mean well. Honestly I do. But I know you, and your tendency to be a condescending, capricious i-don't-even-know-anymore, and I know that you don't. Superficial, pretentious, it was barely an afterthought to you- Fuck, looking back, it's my fucking fault again, isn't it? I shouldn't have expected any better. Stupid, stupid me, I keep forgetting that I should never expect anything to go my way. Least of all when it comes to people.

I don't know how much longer I want to put up with all this. Every day, I just feel more and more tired. Too tired to try, too tired to even complain. I just don't want to do this anymore."

9) ""You're the most beautiful girl in the world.""
   ""You're just saying that.""
   ""No! I'm madly in love with you, and it's not just because of your brains or your personality.""
   (Lots of quotables from this movie. I had a hard time picking just one. :p)
10)""Is that how a warped brain like yours gets it's kicks?! By planning the death of innocent people?!""

HOWEVER, I'd like to advise cosplayers to take note that the catwalk is limited to an hour only, from 3-4 PM. So make sure to limit your catwalk time so everyone can be accommodated. Also, since there will be lots of stuff around expect the cosplay area to be limited too. So plan ahead folks!"

Officially, Christmas season in the Philippines begins today, with the start of Simbang Gabi(which I ignored today, opting instead to continue hunting for Myst Case cards in xmas_dun02), and I can't help but feel blah.

People expect Christmas to be a time of cheer and whatnot, and it bugs me to no end when people keep expecting people to be happy just for the sake of the season.

wtf, I wonder. Happy because you're expected to sing, to give gifts, to be at peace with your fellow man?

Meh, I say.

-----

So Christmas is a time of expectations. This is what I narrowed down as one of the main reasons I dislike Christmas, because I am a child of disappointment.

I have yet to have a single Christmas wish fulfilled.


-----

Remember the days when you were a kid, and you got a toy under the Christmas tree, and you thought it was the most awesome thing ever, and you thanked your parents(not Santa, Santa never made sense to me) for it?

I miss that feeling. When you grow up, it takes a helluva lot more to satisfy you. 

Some people don't seem to lose that sense, though. Material things, and they get all giddy. I pity and envy them at the same time.

Me? I don't expect much from Christmas anymore. I'm thankful for gifts of course, but I don't particularly want anything.

One good night's sleep, and a day without getting upset is awesome enough for me.

-----

A PSP would be awesome too, though.

-----

Last year, I asked for the simplest of things, and one of the two things came true.

Not in the sense I wanted, but it still came true.

It works out, I guess. 

Kinda.

I wish the other one came true too, though. 

-----

<b>Two wishes at a time, because 'Aladdin' taught me to reserve the third one</b>

If it was possible, I'd rather spend Christmas eve watching a movie in a theater, and sipping a cold coke. 

Unfortunately, no. The family insists on christmas dinners.

My other wish this year is world domination. Meh for unfulfilled Christmas wishes."

"event","So for the uninformed, pRO has a new free server; some stuff has been changed to keep the server balanced(like no wings, Pfah.) and some stuff to keep you enticed.(you can now buy cards for PhP. I admit, it's a better way to part you from your money.[proud owner of triple boned katana. xD])

The server is currently on xEXP rate, but I've been told it's permanent. It should be, considering the penalty for dying is now -5%. 

Fun if you just want to play, and should relieve you from the stress of reloading your account every month or so(two months if you're rich, a week if you're poor, or every few hours kung wala ka talaga pera. 8D)

"event","<em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>

That has got to be one of the best ways to wrap up a trilogy. We've seen our fair share of movie series(what the hell do you call 'em?) in the past few years, and not a single one of 'em has managed to wrap up and give you that feeling of satisfaction that comes with watching the final part of a story. This one doesn't feel like it's a wrap-up, but that was an awesome ending nontheless.

Ultimatum, like the earlier movies has very little in common with the book: No sign of Carlos the Jackal, no family, etc., etc. and the cool thing is, I'm still not upset about it. Now, I'm a very picky geek, and when an adaptation doesn't turn out like it's source material, I usually throw a hissy fit and pick apart said adaptation by pointing out every single deviation. If the movie is good on it's own, I let it stand at that: it's a good movie, and a good adaptation.<em>Adaptation nga naman.</em> But if the movie is crap, and the changes are responsible(as they usually are), well.. angry geekboy. (coughcoughharrypotterspiritswithincough)Now, The Bourne movies have always been free of too much psychobabble, despite the whole amnesiac thign going on: we're given enough to know what the main character is thinking, and it works well with the pace of the action. The action is still topnotch with Bourne running urban combat, chases through streets, rooftops, and the awesome CQC between him and the poor fellows who get in his way. I've always been amused by the way Bourne does everything so casually, particularly with his weapons and tricks. A perpetual state of ""What's he going to do with that....oh."" Ultimatum lives up to the older movies, plus some.

Matt Damon is awesome as Jason Bourne as always; The bottled-up tension yet casualness of a trained mind in action.

For those who watched the first two movies, Ultimatum will be a nice send-off for our good friend, Jason.

---

I like the parallelism between the ending of this movie and the beginning of the first. :D I dunno, I just thought it was cool. 

Here's to hoping they leave it at that- I thought The Bourne Legacy was crap. But if they follow the formula of coming up with their own kickass shit, I'm more than willing for the sequel.

and also, for the videogame fans:

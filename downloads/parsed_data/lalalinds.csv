"event","<font color=c23d6c> Maybe you all might find my last night just as amusing as I did when people informed me of just all that went on. Lets start at the beginning on the night (the part I remember)... Elana and I went to Guad for dinner, bought some wine, then went and drank it over at her place.  thats <font color=3c3388>1/2 a bottle of wine</font> right there. From there, Carolyn and I went to Sofias.  Now this was pretty awesome- there was a HUGE line, so we made sure that Justin and Jim (the bouncers) saw us get in line. Justin came over and told us he could either let us in for free if we stood in line, or he'd let us in right then if we payed.  He said the wait was prob 30min so we payed right there, walked up in front of all the poor infortunate souls who had to wait, and got it.  It was sooo cool! Hahaha, all the bear hugs and drinks and flirting payed off!  So we met up with Vel and Mandy, and over the course of about 90min I had <font color=3c3388>3 drinks</font>.  Sonia called me and told me she was at G st. so I told her we'd come over.  And this is where I pretty much black out. The story gets good though.  When we first got there we took a <font color=3c3388>shot of tequila</font> with all the girlies and then Juna'a <font color=3c3388>special monkey shot</font>.  Bill and Dave were there so we took a <font color=3c3388>shot of teguila</font> with them, but then I think we took another <font color=3c3388>shot of tequila</font>.  The Carolyn and I met these 2 guys who we talked with for a while then wanted to take some shots with them.  I guess they had a bottle of wild turkey scoth (I think its scotch, but not really sure) in their car, so we walked over in front of froggys and drank some of that.  Now I kind of remember this, prob only bc the guys were so impressed in our drinking skills, but I probably downed close to <font color=3c3388> 4 shots of that wild turkey</font>.  They preceded to tell us one of them worked at the spca thrift store, and we told them we knew cory who worked there, and I guess cory had told them all about our rampid summer drunken times together (yah thats a whole nother story right there). hahahah but they totally knew about carolyn and i - it was hilarious. So anyways, we went back to G st.  Now I remember talking to Preacher some point in the night, and I'm thinking I might have had a drink with him, but I don't remember if I did or didnt. Oh well. So then it was past last call, but I guess carolyn and i went back in and chris poured us another <font color=3c3388> shot</font>.  of what you ask? nooooo clue haha. Ok so the story gets good... So supposedly i told dev she could drive my car home, so were walking on the street behind g st next to the train tracks. I guess I layed down in the street and told them i didnt want to walk anymore.  Next thing we know, a COP pulls up right next to us and calls in another cop!!! So I guess Carolyns talking to them (who we must remember has had about the same amnt to drink as i) telling them that a friend is coming to pick us up and that I will be ok. So I guess while I'm telling the cops how drunk I am, Carolyn calls Vel who thank god says shell come get us.  The cops even made carolyn pass the phone over to talk to vel.  I guess Vel had to tell them shed take care of us so that they didnt have to ""take us in!"" OMG Ialmost ended up in the drunk tank!! thank god I'm a girl hhahahhaha. anyways, theres more to the story, but i have to go get carolyn so ill save it for later. </font>"

"event","<font color=23a1dc> So the new girl at work came on Sunday.  It was really awkward bc i know shes there to replace me, but no one really knows what is going on, even me. But I had to show her all my duties and such which was also weird.  But shes really nice, and all my coworkers are awesome and telling me they dont want me to go- which is hella nice.  I was planing on applying to some jobs tomorrow, but I have hella shit due Wednesday so I dont think I will have time. Plus, I just found out its Ryans bday tomorrow and were gonna celebrate it at the Elephant Bar so I gotta make sure all my shits done by then. Thats a bit stressful too it means I'm gonna have to spend money (OH NO!) and I know I'll prob end up buying him some drinks (like i dont owe him anywayz haha) but it should be fun and worth it.  

Today my mom totally stressed me out. I have a good relationship with my aunt (her sister) but she doesn't because of certain reasons.  My mom wanted to have thanksgiving with her but found out she was going to oregon to have thanksgiving with some other family. So my mom went into this whole ordeal about how it hurts her feelings.  Now I dont blame her for feeling that way, the thing is, she always complains to me about this after she talks to my aunt bc it always goes this way.  my mom always thinks its bc of her too that my aunt doesnt want to spend time with her, but its really my sister and my mom just doesnt understand that. well i guess bc she thinks mollys a lot better than she really is.  anyways, i didnt want to hear it so i told her i had to go, and put up my away msg, and she responds with ""sorry for bugging you"" and i know its just to make me feel bad.  Oh well, I kow I shouldn't have to deal with it.

Well I'm off to West Sac (wish me luck) to get my new computer!! YAY!!</font>"

"event","<font color=ee3b5a>Thats right, I'm bored on a friday night- whats up with that?  well it sux when your best friend has class 5-7pm so ill blame it on her ;) like i do everything else ;) So I'm officially broke.  very very broke.  so broke that i had to hide my credit cards so i dont use them bc i can't even afford to pay them off. yah crappy.  But earlier i looked for job openings and found 2 that I'm going to apply for once i get my resume peer reviewed.  And I fixed that up too and it looks really good. So today was a productive.  It was exciting too bc i had a guest lecturer in 2 of my classes.  The first was in my wildlife class and i learned that there really are VAMPIRE BATS! but only 2 species that live in Africa I think he said. Besides the old world bats everyones used to seeing, bats are pretty nasty looking. we got to see a bunch of pics of them and I think i cringed every time.  glad i dont like bats.  In my raptor class, a falconer came out and showed us what falconry is.  It was pretty cool.

So i got Ginger back last night after getting spayed and supposedly she was the worst out of all the kittens.  she was sooooo happy to be back though, and I know she was unhappy while being away bc she looks so much skinnier.  But shes eating ok now, and I gave all the kitties some tuna fish which they scarfed down.

Penelope is doing better too.  Hes no longer humping his perch 24/7 and regurgitating. I really need to come up with a new name for him- I was thinking of Master bc he masturbates so much but i dunno if i really like that. any suggestions?

ok i think im going to continue being bored.</font>"

"event","<font color= 802a80> Now that my 3 midterms are over, I feel so good!  G st was a lot of fun last night. I love Karaoki night (no wonder i go every monday night hehe). I sang the song Mickey- you know, ""OH Mickey youre so fine, youre so fine you blow my mind..."" yah it was good.  Another really nice thing was a guy came up and told me I was the prettiest girl he'd seen at G st in a long time.  It was very flattering. I think the boots really do draw quite some attention to me.  yay for being 6ft tall! I haven't been bored in a long time, and now i remember why i miss it. So I thought I'd share my excitement with all you (haha, like the 2 people that do read this!?!?). Charleen took Arthur today to place him with a new foster.  We decided it'd be a good idea to get him comfortable w/ other people than just me. I didnt think Id miss him so much, but I do.  Besides his shyness, he really is a good cat.

Lets see, highlets of the night include me walking in on sonia and her boy (sorry), a great drunken game of kings, and who could forget skinny dipping in the apt pool. I am so glad the cops didn't get called on us, well i woulda felt worse for carolyn ;) but we lucked out.  Lets do it again before the summer ends!  

Evan called me today and I invited him to go to karaoke with us tomorrow night, which he thought sounded cool.  Hes gonna invite his roommates ;) and I'm excited.

Then, about 4am this morning I woke up and went to get a glass of water and heard some meows outside the kitchen window.  Sure enough it was Sam.  Since I ""rescued"" her from the outside shes been real sweet and hanging out with me. Todays my last day with Galahad bc Adriannes taking him tomorrow.

Yesterday, Adrianne and I were down in old sac looking around and we wandered into Evangelines Costume shop and I came up with the great idea of throwing the party.  By the way, if you haven't been there yet, you should go bc its probably the best costume shop I've ever been too. Plus its so early that there were tons of costumes still, and things weren't thrown around and such.  I bought a cop costume hehe.  

Last night was really fun.  I actually got the guts to go up and sing with Grace, hehe and though I don't compare to her, we did good.  Before we went to G st. we each had like 1/2 a shot of absinthe which is sooooo nasty.  I totally forgot how gross it was in Spain, and everytime I drank it, it came back up :(  Yah gross. Oh, pics are up from last night so make sure to check em out uder the random summer pics folder at imagestation.com.

I really hate that it takes me so long to get over a guy.  Admittedly, I still miss Mike and wish he would call me.  Yah yah i know, I should just forget about him, but its so damn hard.  I guess the good thing is it gets easier each day :)

I have the next 3 days off and I have a bunch of stuff to get done.  I still have to get back to the DMV to finish getting the car registered in my name.  Fun times huh. I'm excited about going to G st. Karaoke tonight bc last week was so much fun.  And i saw a lot of people I knew and met a lot of guys ;) so I hope tonights just as good.

Last night I fell asleep at 7pm and so I woke at like 11pm and downloaded a ton of beatles songs.  It was real interesting to read about the song meanings and their life bc they are quite out there (well when theyre not about love that is). I also always thought the song Lucy in the Sky W/ Diamonds was about LSD but come to find out, Lennons son drew a picture in class about his friend Lucy standing in the sky with diamonds.

"event","<font color=a12e4e> Well I found out today that I wasn't really getting a ""free"" car- I ended up having to get 2 new tires and back brakes for the car which cost me a good $375, but thats ok bc we all know I have $$ coming out of my ears (haha I wish). But I'm also going to have to get new front brakes and my CV joints replaced which will totally me $550.  And all that doesnt even include the stupid air conditioner which doesnt work, which they won't handle bc its too old.  But its ok, cause a woman I work with has a brother who works on Hondas so he might able to turn my car into a side job which will be a lot cheaper. Other than that, I'm very happy with the car and I know I won't have to worry about another car for a couple years (which is reassuring).  

About 20min ago, Arthur actually let me come up to him outside of his cage and pet him w/o hissing and running.  I'm so proud of him because hes doing a great turn around (slowely but surely) and I think he will end up being a great cat.  Galahad is the sweetest little guy ever. He keeps me up at night because he loves to sleep with me, either on my head, around my neck, or under the covers. And he purrs the WHOLE time, hehe.  Charleen, the woman who runs the adoption service came by today to check on them and decided they were doing real well.  However, another foster isnt doing so well with their other brother (Lancelot), who looks just like Galahad, because they can't get him to stop biting- almost like Arthur did in the beginnning.  So she asked me if I would trade them for Galahad, and though I'll miss him I'm going to do it because I'm doing real well with Arthur. So a new kitty is on his way :)

I just slept for the last 2 hours and realized I didnt have any clean clothes for work tomorrow so I'm waiting to put my laundry in dryer now.  The next couple weeks I think I'll be working a lot again, but in Sept I won't be working so much, thank god.  I really am not a fan of working 40hrs a wk, and now that I'm going to have some nice $$ coming in from my fund, I shouldn't have to worry about money at all for the next couple years.  Its really reassuring. Not to mention the loan I got which I'm going to use to pay off all my credit cards (YAY).  Financially, things are going to work out well.

I left a msg for my dad today asking him to help me pay for 1/2 of the car job.  Then I got a call from my mom who had talked to my dad who was furious bc he thought Lynda was giving him the car to choose who to give the car too.  I didn't know that he didn't know Lynda gave me the car so now hes totally thinking some scam went on and the rug was pulled from under his feet but oh well.  Of course then he asked mom for my cell number (I think thats about the 5th time we've given it to him) but to my big suprise, he never called me.  Molly is in juvenile hall boot camp for the next 35 days untile school starts.  At her court hearing, she told the probation officer that she wanted to live with my dad (horrible idea).  Of course she was stupid and the night b4 the hearing she went out with friends and never came home, so my mom told the prob officer.  So the judge said to my sister that since she can't follow my moms rules, she does not get to choose who she lives with and that she'll decided for her. And right then and there, they hand-cuffed her and took her to jail. So now that my mom doesnt have to worry about molly, shes going on all these small vacations which I think are good for her. My mom has also decided to let molly go live my dad, and let him deal with her unruly behavior.  We both know it won't last long, so once that doesn't work, they are going to put her into a group home. I am so glad I didnt end up like my sister.

Alright, I'm off to finish laundry and go back to sleep.  Gotta work both sat and sun, but sun night im up for going out :)  oh yah, and monday nights at g st karaoke are a lot of fun, so lets go! </font>"

Anywayz,Im waiting for my great dad to call and tell me when I can have the car.  Knowing him it won't be for another mnth or so.  great dad.

Mentioning bdays, both sonias and gracies were a lot of fun.  its kinda nice though bc ill have a break for this august and I'm going to try not to drink much.  

Arthur's still being a brat.  He's given me quite some good scratches and the bite he gave me the other day is now bruised and painful.  he still hisses if i even look at him and I've resorted to using a towel on him to handle him bc hes too wild.  Galahad on the other hand is doing great.  Hes very friendly, just won't let me catch him when hes out, which is annoying.

Not to mention I'm going to have my aunt do my hair (she owns a salon).  Alright, I think I'm going to shower and go to bed so I'm not too tired tomorrow.</font>"

"event","<font color=902dd1>Alright, so thanx to Carly, I've come up with a name for the kitten- Will (after Will Ferrell- get it ""feral"" hahahaha I crack myself up) Anywayz, despite the bite and some other scratches, hes a real loving kitty.  Today, for about 20min he sat on my lap purring the whole time, and i wasnt making him stay, so I know he was happy. One thing I've noticed however, is that he doesnt really know how to play.  I throw cat toys at him and he either runs or looks at them all silly.  Then I have this one toy, a wand with a string on the end, and I've never met a kitten that didnt like that toy.  WELL, he watches it then runs away!  Maybe he doesnt know how to play...but earlier tonight he found the cat tree in my room and was already on the top floor jumping all over.  but then he fell off hehe.  So, if you know anyone out there that wants to adopt a cute kitten, lead em my way cause hes gonna end up a real gem.  And whata ya know, I've got more pics!!

"event","<font color=333399>wow i havent written here in a while.  lets see...not much is going on besides me workin a lot.  LA was a ton of fun and I had a fab time with Elana.  We went to a bunch of bars on sunset blvd and in hollywood. at the beauty bar we got a cosmo and manicure for $20 :) and the starz shoe bar was cool bc its a bar and shoe store. we also went to this really cool bar where they put a signature margarita in a cut out pineapple.  and they didnt charge us :)  haha we went to soooo many bars and i had at least 1 drink at each that I ended up puking at the end of the night hehe.  good times. the next day we went to magic mntn and stood in line for 90min in 100 degree weather...i also got to see venice beach and 3rd street.  we also got to drive around in elana's dads escalade which was awesome.  we were hella pimpin it, hahahahaha ;)  

I got a new foster kitty too.  The thing is, this guy is 5mnths old and feral, so hes gonna take some work.  He hisses when i reach my hand out to pick him up but after that hes pretty friendly.  he purrs already and rubs all over me, so those are good signs.  however, if i let him run around my room, he hides, then i have to chase him and thats when he gets really wild.  last night he clawed me pretty bad when i caught him and this morning he bit my hand so hard that I was bleeding for a good 20min!  I've never really had a cat do that to me, so it kinda shocked me.  So I've decided not to allow him to run around except before bed.  If I dont, he cries all night long, like he did the first night. He's cute though, his legs are too long for his body right now, hes black and white, and on his white paws he has black spots.  I have to come up with a name for him, so if you have suggestions tell me. Heres some pics of him too:

In the first 2 pics hes hiding under my bed.  In the 3rd hes watching my birds bc hes VERY interested in them.

I'm so excited for Sonia and Grace's 21st bdays!  As of this Friday, this next weeks gonna be WILD!!  I better start working out now to keep off the weight hehe ;)  I'm also excited cause I have the 26th-28th off which will be so nice.  I was planning on going to Sonoma, but now I'm going Aug 5th and 6th.  So if anyone wants to go to the beach tell me :) </font>"

"event","<font color=#990099>ok so i went with grace to the rage night club tonight and it was cool.  all i have to say is that unlike the usual 18+ price ($12) i got in for the 21+ price of $8 and i bought 2 drinks each $2.50 and the last one was way strong. ask for half the ice, bc once the bartenders get drunk, they deff add a lotta alcy. so yah i got ot dance a lot which was way fun too :)

today i took my birds with me into work for boarding.  i miss them already. act it was quite hard to leave w/o them bc i've never left them somewhere b4.  and th efunny thing is, everytime i walk into my room, i expect to see jasper, but i look up and hes not there.  its weird.  but i know theyll be taken good care of. 

so today i was thinking- ive been the happiest ever since like 3mnths ago.  things are going like i want them to go.  not much to worry about.  relationships are good (well most?).  and i just plain out feel a lot more happier than i have in a while. </font>"

Ok so I'm going to have dinner with the grls tonight and I'm going to order my first **legal** drink at chevys hehe.  and tonight i'm going to the bars with elana but im not going to drink much bc im still hungover from last night but itll be fun.  i act have to work at 8:30am tomorrow so thats kinda a bummer.  but gina wants to go with me to the sacramento bars soon too and ill drink a ton then :)  

oh and from the 8-11th ill be in LA cause Elana invited me to stay with her.  were gonna go to a ton of bars then too and get even more shit drunk, hahahaha. im so excited! oh and im gonna visit with lindsay too cause shes there for the whole summer.

oh and for the 4th, what all are we doing?  I still have sierra nevada left in the keg, and I heard tall steve might be having a huge party, which we're invited to go to.  I was thinking maybe for those of us who dont have to work, we could go to lake berryessa for the day, take the keg, and then go to his party at night.  tell me if you're up for it!  or act ill prob just talk to you all about it tonight. </font>"

"event","<font color=#990000>so last night was CRAZY.  haha way drunkeness...lets see we started with port (19% alcy) then rossi then took 2 shots tequila while bbqing.  then finished the WHOLE damn bottle of rossi.  by that time we were hella drunk, met the neighbors around the block, went over there and continued with shots of vodka w/o chaser.  you know you're drunk when no chaser is needed, hahahahha. we saw quite some riskae things ;) ;) and didnt go to bed til 5am!  haha i dont remember much, but i got some good pics ill post soon. and i know you all got some good laughs outta my drunk ass- possibly the drunkest i have been since spain. today i woke at 12, no hangover, sat around with carolyn and oliver watching Mystic River (I joined netflix btw). i just got back from getting a pedicure with carolyn.  im going over to carolyns soon to drink more hahahah and go see gooser, the band, play. im real excited about tomorrow cause im going to santa cruz with elana, were gonna go to this awesome beach i know of.  but see the cool thing is the beach is private property, you gotta just jump a fence, and its not crowded and theres a cliff that blocks all the wind,and a little water fall. and this weather is perfect to go in.  i think we may do a little shopping too in santa cruz and half moon bay. the funny thing about the beach is my mom told me about it, and one time i overheard her on the phone explaining to a friend about the great sex she had on that beach.  haha i always think of that when i think of the beach now. then i get to thinking of all the sex ive had on beaches...hahaha...yah... ok im off to drink again...</font>"

I am still going to talk to her some more and try to convince her to have an abortion.  I think she is making the wrong decision, but I will stand behind her 100% with whatever she does decide upon.  I wish she would just realize how immature she is being about the situation she has got herself into.  People make mistakes, yah we all know that, and she is making the wrong choice even when given the opportunity to fix the situation.  Besides possibly ruining her and her childs life, I hope this decision does not ruin my moms life.</font>"

There are too many things going on in my life, and its really stressful.  I feel like I dont have time to deal with any of them, and  that I have to just take one day at a time.  I feel like I dont have control of my feelings and whats going on right now, and it bothers me.  I guess one good thing is that I might get my grandmas car.  It'll be nice to have a nice car, but its still up in the air. 
It seems I havent needed a lot of sleep lately-I don't feel tired very often.  Even when I dont get much sleep I dont get tired.  Some nights I wake in the middle of the night and just sit there for an hour thinking.  Maybe cause I have too many things on my mind. Haha, I remember when I was younger and I could fall asleep anywhere any time. Can't do that now unless Im drunk. hehe good reason to drink.

"event","<font color=#990000>I don't even know where to start.  My grandma died monday morning at 12:55am.  I was there when she died, and I had been watching her that Friday-Sunday before.  It was very sad to be with her those couple days because we had to change her diaper, giver her meds, change her clothes- just all this pathetic stuff I would never have thought I'd have to do for her.  See, my grandmas was always a very strong woman. Even before she got bed-ridden, she was in a lot of pain because of the tumor, but she NEVER complained about it at all.  not once- no kidding.  So seeing her go through all that was hard for me because she would never have wanted us to see her like that.  By Friday night, she was in so much pain that we were giving her 4 syringes of morphine every hour and an adavan (muscle relaxant) along with that. However, she continued to moan and make faces.  moaning is a sign of a pain between 6-8, and when they squint their eyebrows it can be a pain up to a 10. So she was in pain before she died and that was hard to watch.  My aunt couldnt handle giving her the meds then either, and so i did it. The nice thing was that my grandmas biggest fear was to die alone but she had about 12 family members around her that night.  So we all got to say goodbye.  While over there a couple weird things happened- thurs night we thought she was going to die, but she said, in her sleep- ""im not ready to go."" Other things she said over those days were ""hi mom,"" ""hes coming around the corner,"" and other stuff.  we figure her mom was helping her move on bc she talked a lot about her.  her mom died when she was 20. The weirdest thing had to be while my aunt, cousin, and I were watching a movie.  Out of nowhere we hear, ""how are you doing, how are you doing?"" we all look at each other totally confused, and realize that the noise came from the baby moniter next to her bed.  the thing is, we only use that during dinner time when there is no one watching her, so it turned on miracously.  the other weird thing is that that part in her room catches noise, and isnt supposed to make any noise itself.  so yah we listened a little longer- but it was just crackling noises. i still get goosebumps thinking about it. her funeral was friday, which was sad but i saw a lot of 2nd cousins and other family members i hadnt seen in a while.  But there was a lot of drama going on which was stressful too.  ok i need to stop procrastinating- gotta study. </font>"

"event","<font color= #CC66FF>So in my boredom I decided to look up some random websites and I came across this awesome one, http://www.roxycraft.com/10rules.htm, and here are some excerpts from it: 

<font color= #CC0099>This article is mostly pointed at women.  First, because we compete against each other so fiercely, are more emotional and get wounded so easily by each others actions.  Second, because women need women friends, period.  One thing women fail to do so regularly is make rules.

Rule #1 
I cannot put enough emphasis on this one!  
Do not ever date, kiss, sleep with, talk to on the sly or even crush on anyone your bud has dated, kissed, slept with, talked to, or crushed on.  No exceptions! 
With or without permission, it creates a really uncomfortable situation for all involved.  She may not resent it today or tomorrow or even for years, but it will come back up.

Rule #3 
KIT!  Keep in Touch! This is one of the major problems also.  A lot of friendships die because you just stop talking, simple as that.  Make an effort to talk AT LEAST once a week, AT LEAST!  

Rule #5 
Unload friends who are doing you wrong.  Sound cold and mean? Sorry.  This is a necessary part of life that many people neglect to do. You should only put time and effort into people willing to do the same for you. </font>

My mom just called me.  Told me it was impt that I come home tomorrow to visit my grandma because shes worse. She can't get out of bed any longer and I guess everyone's expecting her to die anytime now.  My dad hasn't visited her since Mothers Day, that stupid asshole. Mom asked me to call him, but I don't want to talk to that fucker.  Its hard for me to believe how fast this tumor grew.  Two months ago I visited her and went to lunch with her, and now shes so close to death.  I think the next couple weeks are going to be really hard for me.

Its actually the sushi restuarant Chris works at so he knew all the guys makeing the food. I really like sushi too, haven't had it THAT much, and it's always been at fujis.  Fujis doesn't even compare to this place and their food.  The food had a bunch of sauces on it and yummm it was just really good.  At the end they gave us these wraps with rice and popcorn chicken in them- it was just really good :) So after that we went back to his place and drank a bottle of wine and watched the movie ""Girl with Pearl Earrings."" BTW- the movie's OK, but slow. So last night was a ton of fun- nice that it was after my bio midterm too. 

I wasn't planning on going home sunday but looks like I am because my grandma is getting weaker real quickly.  My mom said they had to call 911 because they couldn't get her out of the shower the other day.  And she can't even use the new channel changer we gave her on mothers day (easy to use with big numbers).  The sad thing is, her minds still sharp, its just that the pain is so unbearable. My mom gives her less than a month. </font>"

And they were really cool, which made the night even cooler.  Not to mention we were drinkin carlo rossi which is 12% haha.  And we played kings, hadn't played that in a while!

The kittens are doing so much better.  I don't understand how they have so much energy, but they do. The little grey guy continually suckles his tail (its a comfort thing dont ask) and makes this weird noise, which is annoying, but he'll grow out of it (I hope?). He's doing it right now on my lap.  I get to go pick up the little black and white boy in a couple minutes because hes all better, or at least eating- yay! After I'm going to a bird fair too- but don't you worry, I won't come home with another bird. Talking to my mom last night, after telling her I was going to go, she says with her little insinuating voice, ""Lindsaaaay, you aren't going to buy any more birds right?"" I knew it was coming, parents are so predictable sometimes.  Anyways, I must be off to pick up a kitten.  Who by the way, is up for <font color=#009900> adoption </font> and I know you want him- or any of the other 3!</font>"

Here's an update for you...
Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage.

Why?
Because women realize its not worth buying an entire Pig...

I think I wear it too much though.

I've had some weird dreams lately.  The other night I had one where I was at a river, or maybe it was a creek, but anyways- the kittens kept jumping in and staying under for extended periods of time.  And I remember it being both funny and scary at the time because I thought they were going to drown.  But they didnt...and that's all I'm going to tell you because the rest of my dream involved a guy ;)</font>"

"event","That how I have felt. Just coasting through. But I have made a major breakthrough. I have pulled myself out of the deepening hole. Its hard because when I hurt I pull away from everyone and kinda hide. I dont believe in astrology but I cant argue I am behaving like the cancer that I am.

I went to the movies. Push sucked. He's just not that into you is so funny but dont bring a date because really you walk out of there with the need to have a talk.

I went to a party and forced myself to reconnect with friends. Its hard. but hey I need people and I cant hide away just because i am hurting.

My roommate want to talk about how he feels and I cant bring myself to do it. I know that I am his crutch but not this time. He&nbsp;needs to stand and although its not the best time for it I cant carry his weight too. I'm feeling heavy enough for 10 people. 

Work is hard. Apparently, I am very good at it. (I really think that I suck at it. but my boss keeps telling me she is impressed and puts me on special projects. Thats a good sign right???)&nbsp; I lose focus alot which is bad when you are trying to analize so much data to determine if money laundering is occuring.

I am thinking of seeing a therapist and a personal trainer. If i could do both at the same time that would be great.

I am very much looking forward to Joss Whedon's new show but shouldn't he know not to trust fox anymore. I mean come on!!!! they put his new show on a friday..... ::cough:: firefly ::cough::

"event","<lj-cut text=""Jae's reply"">To be perfectly honest. I dont mind explaining, I had to do half a dozen people and keep them updated. I know that understanding things help people deal with them so it makes me feel useful. Like I am helping. Which makes me feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><lj-cut text=""Dealing with death"">What I am having trouble with is what to say to people who offer condolences or ask how I am doing. Maybe it is because I was socilized later in life than most or because we don't TALK in my family, but I have no clue what to say. <br /><br />I normally try to mimic responses I have seen on TV but I know all the ones with death are overly dramatic. It just occured to me that I feel like Anya from Buffy when Buffy's mom died. I need a little help knowing what is appropriate. <br /><br />When people say I am sorry for your loss I really want to say yeah me too but everyone loses someone right. Apparently, the appropriate respons is 'thank you' (roomie clued me in) <br /><br />When people say, 'I cant imagine what you are going through'. I want to say yes you can. You can imagine it. We have all had those times where someone didn't come home on time or haven't heard from them in a while and for a split second (or a couple minutes) think that something is wrong. They are dead. Most people have lost someone so I dont get that expression. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><lj-cut text=""Tricky issues"">And another thing, Milo had collected money to by 8 of us tickets to see Wicked (he had the hook up) but never got to it. I think it would be a good idea to still go. In his memory. He wanted me to see a musical (which i never have) and I want to see the one he wanted. So I tried to organize the group but they wanted me to ask his family for the money we gave him. I will not do that because I know that laying someone to rest is REALLY expensive. My uncle was murdered last year and we held the funeral right around this time and it was really a financial burden. $760 (the amount collected) isn't much when funerals cost nearly $5,000. <br /><br />I am not mad at them for not wanting to spend $75 again. I am mad that they want me to ask. So I am going, probably with roommie Lucas and his 'friend' Jean. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><lj-cut text=""Weird rant"">OMG that is another thing that bugs. Jean is the french guy that moved here to be with Lucas. Lucas refuses to call him a boyfriend even though he is over all the time. He cleans up. He brings food. They have noisy sleepovers (yes that is what i am calling it). He flew back and forth for 6 months every month just to visit him. And now that he is here Lucas is being a fucking ass hole. He says dicky things to him and never compromises (ok Lucas doesn't compromise with ANYONE, only me if I beg and he feels like it) and is generally not nice to him. I feel like pulling Lucas aside and saying 'this is not how we treat people'. I know it is not my place to say and I wont say anything but really tall, handsome, funny, smart man moves here just for you and go all dicky? WTF. I really like Jean. We have had so many talks while i was unemployed. He actually respects that I refuse to get involved in Lucas's love life (well other than ranting on LJ). Guys usually think they have to win me over in order to get in good with him. Wrong, Lucas hasn't asked me if i liked the person he was dating in 2 years. Some of them think they can talk to me about what is going wrong with their relationship. Wrong. I dont want to hear it. Some of them have asked for a three way. YUCK!!!!!!! Sex with someone you consider a younger brother (even if he is older than me) is gross. Jean doesn't do that. When their relationship is bothering him and he needs to talk he just says, &quot;Ah ahm reeally worried about dis. He sooo afraid to let me in.&quot; Thats usually it. which i dont think crosses a line. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />Anyway I am going to <lj user=""slashpervert"">&nbsp;'s HP tea today and wow I am excited. I dont think i will dress up because I cant think of anything but it is an outing with new people!"

"event","<p>I really wanted to update but I couldn't talk about it yet. <br /><br />Milo passed away on Monday morning. Yesterday four friends and I went to his apartment to make it family safe. We cleaned got rid of porn and something that 3 gay men and two fag hags had no clue what it was.....<br /><br />For Milo's birthday this past november i gave him a little stuffed Pug and told him his name was Otis. Because of the movie. I never like giving men stuffed animals or any gift that would be considered girly but he loved it. He kept saying how it was so thoughtful. So I took it with me last night and it is among my stuffed animals. <br /><br />It is really wierd but cleaning his place and talking with my friends in his place was so cathartic. I am not sad or angry anymore. My faith in god is REALLY shook. I honestly think at this moment the only reason I believe is so that he will be in heaven. And as far as I am concerned thats not a bad reason to have faith. <br /><br />On friday after they had unhooked him from the machines and&nbsp;he was still breathing on his own, I went to visit. I read him a prayer before death out of my prayer book I have not opened since my grandmother gave it to me when I was 19 or so.&nbsp; I suppose it might be comparable to final rites but for christians? But I prayed for the forgiveness of his sins and safe passage into heaven. <br />I told him I would see him later. And I will. Just not on earth. If i get to heaven and he is not there, God and I will need to have a chat.<br /><br />Although I am nowhere close to settling down, I have decided my son will be named Milo. If my son is half the guy that Milo was/is then he will do the world a lot of good and that is all that we could ever ask for.<br /><br />I am really going to miss him. I am not sad just missing him like when he went to New York for the summer.</p>"

"event","So I am currently sick. I was super sick on Thursday. I texted my roommate asking him to get me OJ and crackers. As it turned out he got the message as he was walking in the door. 

I asked him if he would get it and he said no.&nbsp; After begging him, literally, he throws a fit because his &quot;friend&quot; says in his very french accent, &quot;Ah but she is zick! If you do not go I will go! She is soo hot. I heard he wretching all morning!&quot;

He finally storms out of the apt goes to get me juice and crackers.&nbsp; Am I really weird because this bothers me?

When he had his appendix out. I went shopping for him. Called his mom and work. Made homemade broths and mashed potatoes. I take care of him EVERYTIME something is wrong. I always side with him on arguements with friends. I let his fucking boyfriend move in. AND I NEVER COMPLAIN THAT HE IS FUCKING CRAZY!!! 

Seriously, I think I need out of this. He is a good friend because he gets me. I dont piss him off the way I piss of other people. but i dont know if that is enough. He is selfish. 

We had a conversation a long time ago that I was ok with being a crutch. A crutch is temporary something to lean on. I cant be a cane. I think that 2 years is living together is all I can take.

I just dont want to feel bad for asking him to walk a block to get supplies because I am sick."

"event","<p>I am finally back. After Thanksgiving, I got so broke I had to let the internet and cable TV go away for a while. Then I GOT&nbsp;A FREAKING&nbsp;JOB!!!!&nbsp; This i a job that i am VERY underqualified for and pays as much as I was making at the top of my game&nbsp; 2 years ago.&nbsp; I am trying not to suck at my new job so I work literally 12 hour days. I have had the job for a month so I am pooped but getting a little better.</p><p>So Thanksgiving went ok. Thanks for the advice of flist. The dinner was fabulous. We ended up having 7 people over. One of them is quite flamboyant (he was dressed as a gay pirate, seriously he needed a peg leg and parrot)&nbsp;and roomies brother sat at the table not talking looking like he was about to cry. So I sent him to his brothers room without dinner. After that we had a lovely time and drank what must have been a winery. Little brother came out of the room when he was ready to act like an adult and settled down. We ended up going to a bar down the street after dinner and he apologized to me about his behavior. He was really embarrassed but told me that he just didnt know what to do or what to say. He kept insisting that he did NOT cry. So I told him we would just tell everyone he got a migraine. Roomie went along with the migraine story. We had to leave the boy with some dignity because seriously a 17 year old boy crying because there is a gay pirate sitting across from you...<br /><br />Anyway after thanksgiving roomie just ignored his brother, meaning if i didnt take him anywere, he wasn't going anywhere. So I got his little bro as another little cousin. We hung out alot. I took him all across the city. I showed him his first ocean. Which he was trying to be all tough guy about. I asked him if he wanted to take a picture or look for shells and he said, &quot;Im not a kid.&quot; But after I said that his mom might like a shell and some pictures he went crazy with it. When we got home he showed roomie the pictures and was very excited cuz he got a pic of a wave breaking.<br /><br />All in all he was a good kid and I got roomie to promise to try again when the kid turned 21. but that relationship is pretty much dead right now.<br /><br />I spent christmas with roomie and his mom (they really are my adoptive family), where she tried to stuff us to the gills with everything that had a shell in the ocean. It was nice.<br /><br />My roomies &quot;friend&quot; from paris moved in with us for two weeks on christmas night. He is relocating from france and we agreed to help him get on his feet. I let roomie know he could stay for a month but he cut it down to 2 week. I personally dont think that is enough time but hey, its not my psuedo relationship.<br /><br />I was PMSing hardcore on new years so I decided to stay home and spare everyone my bad attitude.<br /><br />I met a guy and totally liked him. I mean alot. and then I found out he was horribly homophobic. Like &quot;homo's dont have a right to live&quot; homophobic.&nbsp; I am very mad at this. I found a guy that meets all my guidelines except for the most important one. &quot;Thy must be able to roll with the homies&quot;. I cut him lose. So I am alone and horny again.<br /><br />But hey my internet is back! I have my first non work/research weekend.<br /><br />I will try to get back to commenting on journals like i used to.

Nevermind that roomie didnt lift a finger until I had to ask him to wash the glasses...</p><p>Anyway the kid is 17 and from a VERY small town and a bit close minded. But all in all a good kid. Downside. Somehow in the 2 hours roomie and bro spent in commute from airport to house, brother managed to rub him the wrong way and disrespect roomie.</p><p>Now roomie is VERY tempermental and was already on the fence about brother's attitude. Upon arriving, I was informed that I would be attending dinner (even though I just had a hearty dinner of scrambled eggs). It was awkward and all the little sarcastic comments that anyone growing up with a sibling is used to really pissed Lucas (roomie) off.&nbsp; Drew (brother) was treating Lucas like he was just one of his friends and talking in that annoying way that 17 year olds do. So at the commentshat the guy with the orange pigtails on BART was weird, that our friend that wanted to build a laser was wierd, that i liked chinese food was wierd were not appreciated. Sadly Lucas didnt take &quot;wierd&quot; like i took it. I took it as out of my experience. And really Lucas hasnt been around straight guys in FOREVER except to work with them. He hasnt been around a teenager since he was one.&nbsp; At dinner, Drew made a comment that Lucas is never happy (which is pretty much true) and Lucas replied that he was happy right before Drew came.</p><p>Dude! The kid's face crumbled. I felt so bad. So I told Lucas that I was taking Drew to pick up supplies and had a little talk with him. He just cant relate to him and the kid is tryiing everything that he knows and sadly that aint much. The common curtesy that Lucas would show for a stranger in a bar is not shown to his brother.</p><p>I talked to Lucas and asked him to give him another chance and to just talk to the kid and let him know what he did wrong.</p><p>That fool had the nerve to tell me i just didnt understand..... Me.... who met my half brother for the FIRST time when i was 19. Um.... hello I do understand. I told him this and then he just closed off not listening to me.&nbsp; He said that if he doesnt change his attitude then he will send him back home. Drew told me that the non acknowlegding thing is the way everyone acts where he is from. He really wants to get along well with Lucas.</p><p>I basically told the kid not to say something is weird. Just say, &quot;I am so not used to that&quot; or &quot;Thats interesting&quot; and that he is just going to have to get used to trying new things.</p><p>I know 17 year olds. This kid and I had a 4 hour chat about any and everything. I really think that this is roomies problem and he doesnt realize that he is being too defensive.</p><p>Flist: should I meddle more? I cant stand the thought of them not speaking from a simple misunderstanding. My sister and I did that for too long.</p><p>Le Sigh...</p><p>Whats a girl to do?</p>"

I tested my butternut squash soup recipe tonight. OH&nbsp;MY&nbsp;GOD&nbsp;YUM! That is so a definite yes for the big cooking day. 
My friend Sean was laid off last week and I see him even less than I used to, which is a shame because he is so much fun. But tonight I went out with him, roomate Lucas, and good friend Otis (names have been changed). I had a fair bit of alcohol.... but since all I had was soup, it went straight to my head. Hard core drunk right now. Meaning that I will probably pass out with the laptop on my bed and a bad hangover tomorrow as I head to work.

In other news, 2 people dropped out of thanksgiving! I got one MAYBE.&nbsp; My roommate vetoed (how the hell do you spell that) one!&nbsp; Which leaves me, roommate, roommate's brother and irritating boy. This means I need to lose a side. Great. More decisions and an awkward Thanksgiving.

"event","I was asked for my Sweet Potatoe Pie Recipe today and I thought I would post it in case anyone else wanted it. I don't mean to toot my own horn but I make a fantastic sweet potatoe pie. It looks very complicated but it is not really. AND although the list of ingredients does look a bit daunting most bakers have all this stuff anyway. My grandmother and great grandmother loaded me down with enough southern recipes that you could call me Paula Dean!&nbsp; <br /><br />Other than protesting, this weekend I made 2 sweet potatoe pies and&nbsp;2 sock-it-to-me cakes for bake sale when I was supposed to be testing a chicken stock recipes. <lj user=""copperbadge"">&nbsp; uses baked/roasted chicken as his base while I have only ever used raw chicken in mine. I wondered which would be better and was supposed to make both but then Prop 8 passed and I had alot of protesting to do. So I will try to get to the bottom of it next weekend.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also made mashed potatoes with celery root and roasted garlic. This was absolutely the best ever. You basically dont need salt in it at all!<br /><br />But on to the recipe!&nbsp; <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Sweet Potatoe Pie Recipe!""><br />This recipe makes 2 pies. <strong>NOTE: Sweet potatoes are yellow on the inside,&nbsp;smallish,&nbsp;and just vaguely sweet. Yams are orange on the inside and quite sweet and get really big.<br /></strong><br /><br />For pie crust I use a mod of the standard bisquick pie crust recipe. Ready made pie crust or graham cracker crust are just as good. Actually the graham cracker crust is just a little better!<br /><br />Bisquick Pie Crust<br /><br />2 cup Bisquick<br />1/2 cup margarine or butter, softened<br />4-5 tbsp. boiling water<br />1 tsp cinnamon<br />1 tbsp. confection sugar<br /><br />Mix together with fingers. Separate into two equal balls. Press them flat and wrap them individually in plastic wrap and refrigarate them for at least an hour. Roll them out flat, put in pie pan, and do the fancy pinching. Bake at 350 degrees (sea level) for 5-8 minutes. Do not let it get brown. This ensures no soggy bottomed pies. No need to prebake the graham cracker crust.<br /><br />Filing:<br /><br />2 Freakishly huge yams<br />2 Largish sweet potatoes<br />1/2 cup of butter (not sweetened butter not margarine)<br />1/2 cup of brown sugar<br />1/2 cup of white sugar<br />2 tbsp of maple syrup (optional)<br />1/2 tsp of almond extract<br />1/2 tsp of vanilla extract<br />1/2 tsp of cinnamon<br />1/2 tsp of nutmeg<br />small can of evaporated milk (sorry i dont know the ounces)<br />1-2 eggs (depends on how big the yams are if they are damn near football sized use 2)<br />1/2 tsp of baking powder<br />dash of salt<br /><br /><br />Common misconception sweet potato pies rarely have &quot;sweet potatoes&quot; (here to abbreviated to SP) in them. It is usually yam. I like to use both because SP's are more starchy.<br /><br />Take 2 'OMG these are the biggest yams I have ever seen' yams and 2 largish SPs and clean them VERY well, with a brush or possible steel wool. In your largest pot, stock pot preferable, stack the yams at the bottom then the SPs. Fill with warm water till about 1 or two inches above the last SP. Bring to boil and keep it there for about 45 min. SP will be done around the 30 min mark. To test stick a butter knife through the middle. If you feel any resistance other than skin leave them in. The yams should be done in 45 to an hour. Test the same way. Pull them out with a big spoon, NOT TONGS. They are so tender that you may splash yourself when they fall into the water. Run them under cold water til cool enough to touch but still warm. Cut the skin down the middle and peel off the little jackets and put innards into mixing bowl.<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br /><br />Add everything but the white sugar and eggs and blend with mixer until no lumps are left but before it gets to puree. TASTE THE MIXTURE. Depending on the sweetness of yams you might not want the additional sugar. If still needs it add half the sugar, stir with spoon and taste again. Add more until it meets your sweetness requirement always stirring with spoon. Then mix eggs in with mixer.<br /><br />Pour filling in pie crust with 1 cm or so of space to grow. Set pies on cookie sheet and bake for 40-50 minutes until knife comes back clean.<br /><br />Let cool for at least 30 minutes (It is going to be hard because they smell so good) preferably an hour.<br /><br />Then enjoy. Please let me know how they turn out if you decide to make them. It looks more complicated than it is but totally worth it.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

"event","<br />I was watching an old episode of Desperate Housewives and heard the phrase &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot; and thought 'what the hell does that mean'? I am a bit a of a nerd, so I googled the etymology and found this:<br /><br /><font size=""2"">Perhaps it's a sign of our increasingly fast-paced, short-attention-span society that even our old proverbs are being shortened and clipped down from the original full sayings. </font><a href=""http://www.word-detective.com/081100.html#proofpudding""><b><font size=""2"">Word Detective</font></b></a><font size=""2""> and other etymology sites pointed out that the phrase originated as &quot;the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&quot; It means that the true value or quality of something can only be judged when it's put to use. The meaning is often summed up as &quot;results are what count.&quot; </font><p>According to Bartlett's <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/100/733.75.html""><i>Familiar Quotations</i></a>, the phrase dates back to at least 1615 when <a href=""http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Literature/Authors/Literary_Fiction/Cervantes__Miguel_de__1547_1616_/"">Miguel de Cervantes</a> published <i>Don Quixote</i>. In this comic novel, the phrase is stated as, &quot;The proof of the pudding is the eating.&quot;</p><p>Word Detective and the <a href=""http://www.xrefer.com/entry/635803""><i>American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms</i></a> note that the phrase came into use around 1600. However, a bulletin board quotes <i>The Dictionary of Cliches</i>, which dates the phrase to the 14th century. The board also mentions a 1682 version from <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0808141.html"">Bileau</a>'s <i>Le Lutrin</i>, which read, &quot;The proof of th' pudding's seen i' the eating.&quot; A page of <a href=""http://www.hmssurprise.org/Related/recipes/OEDpud.html"">pudding definitions</a> from the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> also cites the author Boileau (Bileau) as the first to use the phrase. So it seems likely that the phrase dates back to the 1600s, though the identity of its author is disputed.</p><p>These days, some people shorten the phrase to simply &quot;proof of the pudding.&quot; Even the <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0596900.html""><i>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i></a> trims it down. Occasionally, it is even further abbreviated to &quot;proof in pudding,&quot; irritating purists who argue that the shortened versions don't mean anything on their own. Let's just hope it doesn't get further reduced any time soon. &quot;Proofpudding&quot; just doesn't cut it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>I found it interesting. Hope you did too!"

"event","My roommate is a former meth addict. He wouldn't mind&nbsp;me saying it, he&nbsp;would tell you that if you met&nbsp;him.&nbsp;When I met him, he told me all about it; in graphic detail. I do know addiction but I dont know of addiction like that. He woke up one morning (well before I met him), and decided he didn't want to be an addict anymore. That was the day he stopped taking crystal meth. One thing that I learned about Lucas is that he has a strong personal code. When he makes a decision about something, he sticks to it. He believes that drug use and drug abuse are two very different things. If you occasionally use thats fine. But when the drugs take over your life like they took over his, it has become a problem.&nbsp; He has been clean for over three years. Living where we do, thats a very hard thing to do. He had always told himself that when everything is going well in his life, when he is comfortable with the people offering and the situation he would do it again.

Tonight he came home in a tizzy. He had been offered by an old boyfriend he is still on good terms with. He said no. He just couldnt get why he said no. There would be no repercussions, he just didn't feel like it. This fact bothered him alot. I told him that to me the Lucas that did meth and the one I know are different people. The man he is today is an inspiration to me. To overcome something that hard has made him my hero truly. I outlined how much growth I have seen in him over the past two years and how much I admired him. I sat there as he figured out that all the goals he had set for himself had been met. This was the last one.&nbsp; He said he could TASTE the meth. He was craving how it made his nose burn and how it made his face feel on fire. He missed the confidence it gave him. But that he realized that he is not the person that needed it anymore. 

Of course I cried. then we put on our favorite alt-rock and sang and danced and laughed at how life is so funny. Then he thanked me for being there for him and never judging, keeping him on track and pick him up when he fell.

No one has ever thanked me for caring and being a friend before. I am crying as I am writing this. I am so proud of him. How many of us can say that we have achieved what we wanted. Lucas is such an awesome GOOD&nbsp;person and he is just starting to realize that there are people in his life that he has blessed just by knowing."

"event","So tonight I was out having a drink on the smoking patio of &quot;The Bar&quot; with good friend Sean, roommate Lucas, and ex-roommate Tom. When 'why do I tolerate him' Jonathan showed up and totally harshed my tipsy. Sean has the super power of witty and it was in full force tonight. But he and Jonathan left. Lucas, Tom, and I continued to enjoy our evening when two drag queens we know came. They were dressed as males so I didnt immediately recognize them. 

What I didn't notice immediately was that Donna Tellall was very drunk. Seema Bush was trying to rein her in but failing like a failing thing.&nbsp; I am not sure what I did but I think I didnt laugh at a joke and Donna Tellall called me a bitch, put her hand in my face, and told me I didnt belong because I was in a gay bar.

First of all, I am bi. Second of all, I have a quick temper. Knowing Lucas has made me a WAY better person and not so quick to pop off but I can go from normal person to L.A. in 1.5 seconds flat. I was really proud of me because I got my purse and walked back into the bar and didnt say anything. I cooled off and came back in and caught the tail end of roomy Lucas telling Donna to never talk about his friend that way.

I love my roommate.

Donna made a really, REALLY big scene. Cursed out Seema. tripped over something, crashed into the little table, spilled drinks (not mine) and landed in broken glass. He/She cut herself really bad. I got up to help and she started screaming &quot;Don't touch me. Ive got AIDS&quot;. Oh my god, I felt so bad I started crying and getting napkins. Seema went and got the bar back to get bleach. I didnt know. I feel so bad because even though she was horrible, AIDS is not something to wish on your worst enemy.&nbsp; Living in the Castro, I come in contact with positive people all the time. My late uncle had AIDS and so I think that I have a different view on it than other people. 

Everyone wouldnt get close to him after that. The look on his face was something that I can't even describe. I just feel so awful. When are they going to find a cure or a vaccine for this shit"

I didn't ship anyone on that show but I did love the Wilson/House dynamic. How can he not be his friend anymore! If this was real life, I would have told Wilson long ago to cut out the cancer that is House. <br /><br />Now on to Fringe. <br /><br />From the first episode, I thought this was going to be a great show. I mean, who doesn't love Josh Jackson? The main character has some major qualities that I love and a look that keeps reminding me of Gwenyth Paltrow in Royal Tenanbaums, Clair Danes, and Donna from That 70's show. I found their attempt at humor a bit shallow but ok on the whole. The fact that the show was based on fringe science and the science they were doing did not conflict in my head. Hey, add in a healthy dose of LSD and anything is plausible right? <br /><br />But tonight... My roommate and I kept slapping our heads and yelling at the TV. While I had to explain to a self educated man that considers himself average that not everyone knows what the pituitary gland does, I couldn't support alot of what went on in the episode. <br /><br />Rapid aging that stopped once subject injected himself with a serum made from pituitary extract. The same thing that promotes aging/growth. <br /><br />And let me get this straight, the body can grow from a fetus to old age in 4 hours based solely on an over active endocrine system. I dont know about anyone else but when I went through a growth spurt, there was never enough food in the house. Let alone how taxing it would be on the heart. <br /><br />Last images being burned into dying eyes. Where did this burning light come from? The eyes are a lens, how did their handy device interpret images like the brain would. <br /><br />This isn't Smallville! You can't blame it on convenient glowing rocks! I am willing to suspend a lot for a show but damn! This is from the girl that said said &quot;The Core&quot; was a good movie as long as you suspended any knowledge of wave dynamics and physics. <br /><br />I was soooo ready to love this show but they need to come up with better crap science. <br /><br />PS. JJ Abrams what is up with you and your fucking clues!!!!! Old man naming random prime numbers to help him sleep. I know its a clue. I didn't put in a season and a half of &quot; Lost&quot; not to know when you are hinting at something. You better give me answers damn you. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><br />I am really interested in others thoughts on this show so please feel free to comment."

"event","I love my roommate. Really I do. But he is the most picky and finicky person in the world. I&nbsp;am trying to plan his birthday party and&nbsp;all he keeps telling me is that no one except me cares about him.&nbsp;Granted he&nbsp;has depression but sometimes&nbsp;I think he just&nbsp;makes himself depressed.&nbsp; Anyway, I am planning his birthday party and here is my dilemma. He does not like people looking at him so karaoke is out.Our neighbor&nbsp;will put in a noise complaint if there are people over.&nbsp; He does not like the sun, so outdoor activity is out. Paintball is very far from us.&nbsp;There is no laser tag in the area. Go Karting is very far and very expensive.&nbsp;So I&nbsp;finally figured out&nbsp;""Hey everyone&nbsp;likes bowling right?"" I put down the sizable non refundable deposit. I harrassed the place into giving me exactly what i wanted. I hounded the food place to give me a 30 % discount. I wrangled up friends he hasnt seen in years.&nbsp;

Then:
An acquaintance of&nbsp;ours tells us that he went bowling&nbsp;for a work sponsored bonding type thing and I (a little tipsy) lean over and whisper&nbsp;what i am doing for&nbsp;roommate). Roommate figures it out of course and then tells acquaintance ""I hate bowling"".

Okay. he figured it out and then said ""I hate&nbsp;bowling"" loud enough for me to hear. Then he follows me into the bar and said why did you think bowling would be a good idea. And i am pissed off. He is always complaining that no one cares but that&nbsp;is all we can&nbsp;figure out with the limitations. He wont stray far from our neighborhood because he is afraid of getting harassed,&nbsp;so we cant just take him to a different bar or club that we dont frequent. There is literally nothing else to do.&nbsp;There were massive amounts of email just to figure out something. But he maintains that all he wants for his birthday is to be surprised but that is bullshit. I think i am not going to do anything. I am really pissed off. I told him i was mad and he just dismissed my feelings.&nbsp;

Am I being self centered? it is his birthday but when someone does something nice for you and you dont like it arent you supposed to fake it?


I am open to suggestions if anyone has one.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

Sandra Bullock + Keanu Reeves winning best kiss for the Lake House: WTF?&nbsp; How the hell did that happen. I really remember seeing that movie and saying to my friend Tati that it was the weakest kiss ever. Totally not believable.

Britney: Oh got her tits are HUGE! Bigger than mine huge! She is still pretty.

KFed: I never really noticed that he is actually attractive when he shuts up. Although I have to admit that I watched his performance for a laugh. Why is he using other peoples beats? I think that most ppl were clapping for his back up dancers. They were hella tight."

"event","Yes I am on a very strict diet. Not because I have finally decided to get into shape but because I am broke. I have to make all my food last for two weeks.

On top of it I cant afford anymore cigarettes. No cigs and limited food.

HELL!

Of course every commercial is for food. 

It strikes me that the US is a very food-centric country. And I am a very food centric person.

As long as I have a task I am very cool. This week I have been very busy and going to sleep very early. Meaning that all week I can literally list what I ate. 

Two Apples
Three Chicken Thighs
One Large bag of Chex Mix (spread over tree days)
Two slices of toast today.

But I had nothing to do today. So I kept thinking about how much I some Pizza Orgasmica. 

Lopez came over to hang out and we ended up playing scrabble. 

Freaking Scrabble! But I honestly couldnt think of anything else to do in my house since I am broke until my new job starts and he is broke until monday.

So we played and he actually gave me a run for my money. Oh and a cherry blow pop (I had remembered a fic where Clark ate a blow pop to drive Lex crazy and thought I would give it a try with Lopez)

It worked! He kept letting eyes his drift to my lips. We talked a while and then he had to go to practice (which is two houses down).

So I walk him downstairs. We are in the hallway and he just stops. I kinda almost run into him. He turns and kinda does something. I'm not sure but since I am kinda freaky about personal space at the oddest times. So he somehow manuvers me against the wall (I am still not sure how the fuck that happened). So he bends his head down and says ""so do you taste like cherries"". He hoovered like right in front of my mouth for so long. Then he kissed me, open mouth. Then he said, ""you taste like candy"" and bit my lip. In a very nice way. My knees went weak and I just kinda focused on him. So I didnt really hear the guy that lives directly under me coming down the hall until he said,"" I guess your bed will be squeaking tonight."" Lopez just smirked.

I told Cisco to fuck off. The moment was broken. Lopez left. 

I whipped out my phone and called my best friend. She keeps refering to this event as back you against the wall, teasing, nip libbling (lip nibbling), make me weak in my knees, smirk afterward kiss. 
 
It was our first kiss. I felt like it was my first kiss. It had to have been the best kiss of my life and so worth the two weeks I waited for the inital kiss.

And I only got one kiss. Just one. But god it was so good."

"event","So Lopez came over last night and we kicked it and watched ""the united states of leland"". He really liked it. I mean he couldnt stop talking about it. I thought it was okay. 

So he asks to check his email. So I kindly offer up my computer before I remember what I left up. Ahem: There is a very nice picture of Beckett hips from DYW. Not that embarassing right? I would agree but the comment under it had an icon where Ryan and Brendon look like they are kissing.

Lopez looks at me and says, ""You like slash.""

I tell him yeah. He says thats cool. I asked him if he was,(cuz you never know if the guy you are with is checking out the guy you are checking out). He say no I am not into guys. But I get it. I think two chicks are hot so why shouldnt you think two guys is hot.

I have never had a guy actually get my reasoning let alone have the same reasoning.

The only thing is that we have been out on 3 official dates and 1 hangout. Still nothing more than a kiss on the cheek or a hand hold. Am I being slutty because I am dying for some makeout action. I mean look at him <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f80/true2meeh/HPS2W_79C1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Lopez, whose first name he hates so I dont wanna put it out there, was so cool.

I mean wowzer.

First off he came to my door to pick me up. He brought a sunflower cuz he figured that I would like it.  We went to this little coffee shop on Clement and talked for like 3 hours. We never made it to his friends show. We talked music, books, TV, and movies. He knows who Jean Paul Satre is.

I thought his eyes were grey but the are in fact the greenest green. He looks a little like a cute John Mayer. 

I kept feeling like  ""why does he want to go out with me""

We are going to see 'a scanner darkly' tomorrow.

I will wear something to accent my cleavage.

So he walks me back to my place and kisses me on the cheek.

I asked him about the guy shouting Nike in the background yesterday.

He said that Jimmy was telling him to 'just do it'. LoL. Grr..Duh.

He doesnt really ask girls out because he got his heart broken last year and it made him have a lot of self doubt. I told him that I totally got that. I am introducing him to the love that is GCH tomorrow.

He is burning me Thursday because he cant believe that I didnt love them.

He thinks my internet stalking of bands is cute. 

I cant stand it! This guy is like wow. Something has to be wrong with him, right?

Geehz... self confidence gather for round four!"

"event","So today was a very interesting day. Well actually it began last night.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for length and consideration to your flist"">

I had an interview today for a job that I felt I was very underqualified for (Damn the preposition rule). So I needed to look hella nice right. So I needed to wash clothes so that I could wear a suit. Jr. Loan Officers need suits right? The only thing, 'So you think you can dance' was on. I couldnt miss Donyelle and Benji right. So I ran up and down the three flights of stairs to my apartment five times. A machine stopped working on my clothes. The cute little rocker guys on the corner stopped me the 2nd to last trip. I have be trying to get up the courage to talk to them for 6 months. Its like I am in high school again. I am the nerdy chick and they are the cool slacker guys in a band. 

So anyway I was rushing around the corner fully aware that I had a minute and a half until SYTYCD came back from commercial. The guy stops me and says ""Hey I like that color.""

I stop so hard I almost fall. He was of course commenting on my burnt orange peasant skirt. I say ""Thanks."" Sensing my in to a conversation I ask what he is blasting from his house. He says his band. I say you guys kinda sound like Wolfmother. He calls his friends down and tells me to repeat that. The guy that comes down is the cutest boy/man I have ever seen. I mean like... ""Uh... What? ::drool:: mdkjfaldskjf. I swear I was intelligent 10 seconds ago."" kind of cute, adorable, and doesnt know it.

So I tell him they sound like wolfmother. The guy, 'Lopez' is amazed that I am a girl that knows who they are. I pimp that I saw them at BFD. Then he says and I quote, ""WE SHOULD HOOK UP SOMETIME. COULD I GET YOUR NUMBER?"" 

WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK!!!!

He took my number. And then called it in front of me. Then he said,"" Just checking that you gave me the right number.""

Oh my god! A cute guy wanted my number!

He called me today! (but I am getting ahead of myself)

So I walked away smiling like a loon. I remember that I missed my show. But somehow thats really OK.

I get my clothes (Lopez nowhere in sight on the way).

Shower wash my hair blowdry it and flat iron it and press it. (I am black in case any of yall didnt know so it takes me a good three hours do this. 

I pass out at around 1 am.

I awake to my phone ringing. My mom is calling me a 4:30. She wants me to be on time for my 6:30 interview and knows that I take a long time getting ready. 

It is the sweetest thing she has done for me in a long time. It is also the evilest seeing as how my interview is at 6:30PM.

I have a hard time sleeping after that so I get up and iron my clothes. I go back to sleep. Apparently you can sleep through an alarm if you are tired enough. I had a scant 15 minutes to be on the road.

I made it to work on time (only 15 minutes early instead of my usual 30) after an hour drive. (I work in dublin but live in SF). My boss yelled at me in Chinese. The big boss yelled at me in Farsi. The appraiser yelled at me in english. 

What did I do to get yelled at? I refused to do something really illegal in the real estate industry. I almost got fired. But they couldnt fire me because I was right and they knew it.

I told them that I was picking up my cousin from the airport and raced in my 1993 car back to the city. I realized that I had to freshen up since it was literally 100 degrees today. 

I get home shower and run back to the car and race back down town. 

I get there and walk past the building three times before I see the door, feeling like it is the Room of Requirement. I convince the doorman to let me in. I get to the floor and ask the girl and guy in the office if Brandon was in. They direct me to a different (empty) company/office. I come back and inquire the companies name and realize that I am in the right place. I asked again for Brandon. Then the guy says "" Oh yeah Brandon asked me to take the interview.""

OKAY?

So he tells me of the company. I pimp my resume. Talk a little bit of the lingo. He offers me the job on the spot. 

YAH! Right?   UM NO. It is only commission based. The split is 50% for Jr. Officers and 80 for Sr. Officers. This is like really good. I wish I was in the position to take the job. Its a good place to start with good leads and really laid back atmosphere (ie. there is no competition with other officers).  I told him that I couldnt do it and he said that anytime I am ready to make the jump call him, he will hire me.

Le Sigh.

So I mosey back to the car and I hear my phone ringing. I pick it up and it is Lopez. Before he says hi, he says, I didnt know if it was too soon to call.  

How sweet. So I give him the short of my day ask about his and so on. So we are talking for like thirty minutes. I am just sitting in my car talking. 

</lj-cut>

So Lopez the bassist says...

"" So um... Do you want to um like go for like um coffe like um sometime."" It took him like eleventy seven years to get it out and I could have sworn I heard someone in the back ground say Nike or maybe it was hyphee but I couldnt really hear. I was to busy squeeing in my head.

We agreed to get coffee tomorrow evening and go see a garage band. 

I have a date. I am actually ready to date again and I have a date. With a really cute guy. With amazing grey eyes. Guess what like Mikey and Petey he plays bass!

I love bassist. I want a button that says ""Bassist do it with rhythm""

Buttons are like Icons in real life.

I will write to tell yall about the date.

What do you wear to a coffee garage band. He already saw me in what I would have worn. Any general ideas Flist?

I need help for real"

I am freaking addicted to this show.

I love Benji and Donyelle

I think Benji has a crush on Donyelle.

Last week during their performance (which was sexy as hell) he kissed her on the neck. 
This week while practicing the cheorograph said I think you are putting too much into this when Benji was all up on D, lips like 2 inches apart.

Even the judges where like that is really chemistry you cant fake that.

"event","First I would like to say. When I first got this LJ account, there was a 3 icon limit to the free ones. I was looking around today thinking I might switch to the sponsored one for more icons. While reading up on it I discover that I get 6!

Vondurva! Remember all the icons I wanted to make? Well I got the Lexana one (kinda). 

I made my icons using software that came with my ancient digital camera. Thats all. Basically cropping and adding titles.

Then I decided I need a colorbar. Because I like them and I want one. Only I want bands. So I set out making one. I made it with HP Photo & Imaging (camera software), Paint, and Microsoft Word. Printscreen was used. I played with the color saturation for most of the coloring. I used word to put all the pictures side by side. Printscreen. Then cropped in the HP program.

Is this very pathetic?

But here is the finished product. Let me know what yall think.

Is that like acceptable? Did I do okay! 

PS. I also got a very nice H/D icon from virginiablack's journal. <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f80/true2meeh/hd.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a> Lovely.

"event","So I finally downloaded the first episode of StarGate Atlantis. I am sitting down to watch it with my dinner of fried chicken that smells so good. I watch it and then I realize human are the Wraith. I mean we allow cows and chickens and other animals to grow only to slaughter them. As these thing are fliting through my mind the previously delicious chicken starts me thinking. I could be eating Major Shepard.

I know weird thought. I dont want to eat Major Shepard.

I have this thing where if a food is unappealing my mouth wont make saliva and I literally cant swallow. So of course I cant take another bite. I am too hungry to not eat anything so I look in my cupboard and all I have really is a can of corn and a some rice. I wipe that up and munch along all the while thinking.

This morning I tried again to eat the chicken. My mouth is not cooperating. So I eat the left over rice.

My mind is now equating eating meat as eating people. How fucked up is that?

So now I have this whole chicken that I made to last a few days that wont get eaten. (I will donate it to the guys that I live with)

Apparently, I am a vegetarian now. 
Nothing against them but I (until yesterday) LOVED meat. Like could think of nothing better to eat than a good baked chicken breast.

This is my life with my brain.

"event","I am a loan processor and a personal assistant and an assistant property manager. thats alot of ands. Today I had to drive to Vacaville from S.F. Thats about an hour's drive each way. $20 exactly in gas. I get there have a real estate stager come by and literally say, ""I have a lot of great ideas. But I can't tell you because you might not give me the job. I should charge a consulting fee, huh?"" What the bloody fuck! I asked if she would give a free estimate before I had her come all the way out. I calmly told her that if she couldnt tell me her ideas I couldnt say if we would hire her. So she caved and it will probably turn out beautiful but it is a lot of work to be done. With her reccomendations I went to Home Depot with a list of everything that I needed. (I was to get the item numbers and my boss would order and charge them). 

Home Depot is hell. It was 97 degrees inside and I know because i stood infront of the temperature thingy display drinking water looking lost and waiting for the guy they paiged to help me 15 minutes ago. The guy final shows up says I cant drink my water and then tells me he will be right back. 

So ladies and gentlemen I did what any woman would do. I pulled my shirt low, gathered my ample bosom, and looked really hopeless. In less than 2 minutes a guy (who didnt even work there) walked me around and helped me make my list of items. He was really sweet and he is going to call so that I can help him get a loan to buy a house. 

So after all the time at Home Depot I did the personal assistant gig and picked up some documents that my boss needed. It was only another 30 minutes away, in the wrong direction. 

Then I called and yelled at my processors. Why do I have to do your job. We pay you well to do your job. Hell you get paid. (Times are tight right now so I am basically working until we get paid and then I get paid, which means I barely make rent and almost had to sell my computer) 

I love my boss to death. We get each other and between the two of us we get what we want and fast. The problem is that the company is so small that she is barely making even and can barely afford me.

I got a job interview call today also. The place grabbed my old resume off monster and called me. Apparently, I applied to a job there in January of last year and they kept me in mind. So now I have the choice. Steady good (DAMN GOOD) pay or keep with my friend because I know she would drown without me. (Her dad has been dying for the last 6 months and she recently found out she was pregnant. This is bad because she has NO maternal instinct whatsoever. Her dog spend weeks at the babysitters before I remind her that she STILL needs to pick her up.)

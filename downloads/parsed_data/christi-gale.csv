"event","Yea...it has been a while since I updated, but I needed to get this off my chest.

This birthday has been the worst. First, my parents wanted me home on my birthday so I had to rush packing and going to my doctors appointment and then drive the two hours to cypress. Because of all this CRAP I had to take care of, I forgot to register for summer classes. Yes...big fucking oops. So now I'm stuck taking a Physics class at 8 in the fucking morning at northridge. Where the FUCK is northridge you ask??? It's about 23 fucking minutes.

So I get home expected to at least spend time with my family since my parents (DAD) wanted me home. NO such deal. Mom had to work. Cherry was at work. DAD gets home and forgets that it's my birthday. THANKS SO MUCH DAD!

Next day (today) my dad bitches at me for only taking fourteen hours this semester....let's see daddy dearest....I had six hours of FUCKING lab a week and three science class plus American Dilemmas which was a worthless piece of shit class. 

I'm exhausted. I'm so tired of these expectations. I don't want to go to med school anymore. All this crap...I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. I mean, yes, I would love to be a doctor and all and save some lives while I'm at it, but getting there is just so hard and it's not making me happy. I don't know what to do with life anymore, because I'm tired of it. I'm tired of everything and I just want to be done with it and just sleep forever."

"event","1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""
2. I will respond by asking you five questions of a very intimate and creepily personal nature. Or not so creepy/personal.
3. You WILL update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the post.
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.


1. what is your happiest memory from childhood?

       My favorite memory from childhood was fishing trips with the best friends. They were so much fun. I remember always catching next to nothing and Caroline and Charisse making fun of me. The place we fished at was called Pleasure Island and there was a big playground there and we always camped out. Oh and once I thought I saw a mermaid...it was awesome!

2. what were the best and worst things about cheerleading?

      The best thing about cheerleading was stunting and the friends. I was a base but that was my favorite thing to do. Our uniforms were cute but i think i was allergic to the pom poms....i always itched right after we used them. The worst thing about cheerleading.....the early morning practices...we had to run 4 times around the track which equaled a mile and run up stairs which was scary. Also we did this thing called stations and it was a bunch of different exercises and I hated v-ups which is the worst sort of sit up. I got hurt alot because I had girls falling on me almost every practice....

3. what are your top 5 favorite bands?

      This is in no particular order: Say Anything, Maroon 5, Dave Matthews, Death Cab, Eisley...I don't know...it's all I can think of off the top of my head...o..I really like Saves the Day 


4. what is your favorite book?

      This is probably the hardest thing, umm....Ella Enchanted, Harry Potter, the Narnia Series..all these are from my childhood..and I absolutely adore fairy tales, there's probably so much more because I read a lot...the Philip Pullman books are really good to and so was the Redwall Series...now I really like Kafka, and Austen, Pride and Prejudice though is probably my all time favorite book...and most of the classics I've read I really like Salinger, Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, the Bronte sisters, Oscar Wilde, Shakespeare...this was a bad question...lol

5. what is your usual morning routine?

     Now that Nicki's my room mate???? She tries to wake me up everymorning....I sleep until the absolute latest time, I usually shower at night, sometimes in the morning, brush my teeth, do my hair (it takes me two minutes if I leave it curly and 30 if I straighten it), then make-up, and then get dressed. So I take about thirty minutes to get ready since I like to take my time... LOL..."

Feel guilty for leaving the family on New Years since the dad thinks family should stay together, but Cherry really wanted to go with the Mulvaney's, and if I didn't go, I know she would be upset.

Sunday best and broken glass 
Broken down from the bikes and bars 
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars 
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight 
And tonight will go on forever while we 
walk around this town like we own the streets 
and stay awake through summer like we own the heat 
Singing ""everybody wake up (wake up) it's time to get down""

I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open)

Find some conversation 
The low fuel lights been on for days 
It doesn't mean anything 
I've got another 500, 'nother 500 miles

we shut it down

P.S. I think I figuired out what my dreams mean...and I don't think I'm happy with the results. Plus, Cherry said something to me today that kind of resolved the ""dream problem"". It sucks that even in dreams, things don't go my way.

P.P.S. Little brothers are not supposed to grow up. Christian (he's 11) just told me that he had a girlfriend. Her name is Samantha and sh has brown curly hair and glasses and I'm not allowed to meet her. My baby brother is growing up on me and it's freaking me out. I feel oddly pathetic now, my 11 year old brother is in a relationship and I'm not. That's sad.


ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU
Written by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All I want for Christmas
Is you...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need -
won't you please bring my baby to me...

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You...

All I want for Christmas is you baby... (repeat)"

I'm ... I'm ...

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye

But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn
The dentist's waitin', he's revving his drill
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving in a Rav4
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

I'm ...

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I'll tell you now, they don't mean a thing

Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving in a Rav4
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, oh, let me kiss you
And close your eyes and I'll be on my way

Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times that I won't have to say ...

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving in a Rav4
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

And I'm leaving in a Rav4
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

But I'm leaving in a Rav4
(Ah ah ah ah)


Have a safe trip everyone and a happy holidays! Expect a call from me on Christmas ya'll!"

"event","I've heard it said 
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow 
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you:

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good


It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend:
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you:

Because I knew you
I have been changed for good

Like a comet pulled Like a ship blown
From orbit as it Off it's mooring
Passes a sun, like By a wind off the
A stream that meets Sea, like a seed
A boulder, half-way Dropped by a 
Through the wood Bird in the wood

Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better?


And because I knew you:
Because I knew you:

Because I knew you:
I have been changed for good.

"event","Finally had my long awaited picnic.

Nicki and I wanted Italian, so we decided to find the Joe's like place we found one night just driving around. Me, Nicki, and Alex found it, but there were no tables at the place. Decide to eat at a Lowe's parking lot because of the ugly ovary like ball I got. Pretty fun. Alex threw the ovary like ball at Lowe's where it probably scared the shit out of someone. Ate some Smoothie Skittles and then Alex made it rain skittles on 290/71W.

Got bored, so called the wonderful Miss Katie K and went to Kerbey's for midnight queso and dessert. Had fun. 

I'm going to miss everyone."

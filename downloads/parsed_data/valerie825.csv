I've set it in my mind that if they don't tell me right there that i got the job then i didn't and when they say ""I'll call you"" that's just a nice way of saying you didn't get the job.

    At some point during the ride my sister called my dads cell hysterical. She took our dog, Bubba to her place for the week to take care of. At first i had no idea what was wrong but then i figured out that something was wrong with Bubba. I kept asking what happened but no one was answering me. I could hear dana on the phone crying, she was so upset. Bubba was really sick so she took him to the vet. His heart rate was off and he couldn't breathe. The vet wanted $600 to keep him over night but my parents decided to get him put to sleep since he was already 15 years old they thought it was the best decision....great way to start off my vacation! I was sooo upset and i was just trying to hold it all in. I wasn't really thinkin about it all that much during the week but now that i'm home it's really hit me. It's so weird to be here and have him not around! I miss him lots!! 

    On to better things....we got to the place and lets just say it wasn't what we expected!!...haha, it wasn't that bad though...the place was right on the ocean!! We found these two guys that we liked, Brandon and Anthony...they weren't exactly what we expected either...haha! Then we met this guy Ben from West Virginia...he was pretty hot!! We took tons of pictures all week...i can't wait to see them all!! We went shopping just about everyday at Broadway at the Beach and Barefoot Landing....they're kinda like the boardwalk in a way. It's like a bunch of stores and restaurants around a big lake.

  so tonight at around 7 i went to pick up kristin and we headed over kels to go see fireworks. we were supposed to go with joe, but at the last minute he cancelled....It would have been kind of awkward if he did end up going now that he knows i don't like him. Before we got to sun valley to see fireworks and at sun valley we were trying to find nate so kel could see the fireworks with him, but ended up finding out hes in wayne, pa....sorry kel we never found him!!...i know how much ya wanted to! so we meet up with amy and anthony and watch fireworks with them...afterwards we go up to pinnochios to get something to eat and leave there at around 11:30....then we went back to kels so i could get my car, i dropped off kristin and now here i am. 

    FYI: i just wanted to put it out there that kristin had absolutely NOTHING to do with me not liking joe. It makes me just a lil mad that ppl wanna blame her for me not liking him....why can't i just not like him?...why does there have to be some big explanation. I basically don't like him because i wasn't attracted to him like that....its that simple.

So they got to my house around 7:00 and we just sat in my driveway for like a half an hour trying to figure out what to do...we were calling just about everyone in our phones and they were all either not answering or at work or something. Finally we decided to go pick lisa up. We went through the burger king drive-thru. We ended up meeting up with jon in the mall parking lot. I stepped out of the car for a second and they all drove off with out me....good thing jon was there...i hopped in his truck and drove around with him for awhile. The whole night was just sooo boring and there was nothing to do so we decided to just go home around like 10:15. i got back in kels car and she dropped me off at like 10:45. 

   Hopefully tonight'll be a lot funner...i'm going to carmines with kristin and sherwin...haha! randomness!!! I feel kinda wierd goin cause i've been trying to get a job there and i'm supposed to call back today..."

"event","Last night i was supposed to go see The Italian Job with Kristin and Lisa, but it turns out my mom had plans to go out to dinner with all her friends cause she does that every month, but i didn't know it was that night and she didn't i was goin out so one of us had to cancel cause of my little brother, so i ended up cancelling, it kinda made me mad that i had to stay home on my last day of school. Kel's plans ended up gettin messed up too so she came over and we just kinda chilled...we actually ended up having lots of fun....we called some random people...lol..Marissa and Clarrisa Jones...so Sherwin ended up calling us...he def thought we were drunk....we talked to him for a while then he had to go but told us to call him back in a half hour. So my mom got home around 10, and me and kel decided to hit up wendy's and pick up sherwin on the way..haha. We saw rob and his girlfriend in the parking lot....he's a lil shady around his girlfriend..haha. That was pretty much my night, we dropped sherwin off then kel dropped me off. i just wanted to have lots of
 fun last night, and i actually did even though i was home like all night! 

  Ahhh this rain needs to stop!!..i hate it...but next week its supposed to be like 90!!! maybe i'll take a trip to the beach!!"

"event","just called carmines a few minutes ago...i feel like it was really pointless...i figured the owner probably wouldn't be there but i decided to call anyway so i call and some guy answers i say ""this is valerie and i'm calling in regards to an interview i had last week"" and he's like ""okay"" then i say ""i was wondering if there was a chance i could be hired"" and he's like ""i have no idea, my boss isn't here, did you have an interview?""...even though i already said i did..haha so i'm like ""yeah, last week"" and he's like, ""okay, what'd he say"" and I said that he said ""he'd call in like 10 days or something"" so then the guy says something like ""okay i'll talk to him about it"" 
  yeah that was pretty much it! i don't know...hopefully it all works out...i don't know how long i should wait for them to call and apply to other places!...

now off to study for finals and make my cheat sheet for chem!"

   Yesterday i had an interview at Carmines at 2:50, i def don't think i got the job...i'm almost positive. It really sucks though cause i REALLY wanted it! It ended with the guy saying he'll call in 10 days and if he does then i got the job. He also hired atleast 2 of the other four girls on the spot...kelly being one of them...that bitch got my job!!..haha jk i love ya! It just makes me kinda mad cause i wanted it so bad. I was talking to my sister yesterday who's in europe so i haven't talked to her in a while and she said even though he said he'd call in 10 days i should call like thursday and ask about it so the guy knows i really want the job...i haven't decided if i will or not. If this doesn't work out i applied to the y for the kid zone so i'll probably call them back....hopefully i'll get that job...."

Then i drove my sister to the train station so she could go home and get ready for her europe trip that she's leaving for tomorrow for 7 weeks!!! When i got home with my brother my parents were already gone for some thing, so i had to watch my brother all day...it sucks but i'm making money! At like 6:00 we hit up burger king for dinner then came home and watched mr. deeds! and that was pretty much my day so far! 

  Yesterday i didn't do much either. Just kinda hung out at my house for a while then i stopped my kohls and got nothing, came home and a lil later kel picked me up and we went to malvern to babysit. we got a lil lost on the way there, so we stopped at this pizza place and asked these really nice people for directions...so we left there at about 11:00, got lost a lil more coming home but we figured it out..haha! Then i got home at like 11:40 watched some tv then went to bed. 

Friday we had a half day!...that was nice, the day went pretty fast! I took kels bus home then we left at about 11:30 to stop by my house so i could get some money and pick amy up so we could go out to lunch. We ended up going to the american cafe and age and kristin stopped by to say hi and age showed us her new cell! so after lunch we decided to go shopping at exton so we were there for awhile, but then left cause we got scared cause some guy was stalking us! we dropped amy off at her house cause she was goin out with anthony then we went to springfield mall for a lil bit and picked up rob and jason and met up with joe at granite run. we decided to got to hooters and kel told our waitress it was robs birthday so they made him stand on a chair and they all sung to him..haha it was pretty funny. after hooters we were gonna go to friendlys but there was too long of a line so we just went to jason's house for a lil while then kel took me home and thats my weekend so far! i don't have any plans for tomorrow yet, but hopefully something'll come up!"

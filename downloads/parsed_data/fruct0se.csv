"event","So, my job is <b>boring</b>.  ESPECIALLY at the beginning of the month.  All right, so people don't think about buying cell phones when their rent is due, OK.  I probably wouldn't either if I didn't work for a cell phone company.  Frustrating.  Maybe I'll take a nap.

This job is particularly souless, I find.  I'm tired of trying to sell things to people.  I feel as though my skin gets a little more shiny with ever passing day.  Yes, the signs of the slimy salesperson.  Uhgg.

But I suppose my job is just as important to the functioning of society as anyone else's.  If it weren't for me, you would have no one to go to for all your cellular needs.  You'd have no one to cry with when your antenna brakes off.  You'd have no one to yell at when your service was lousy.  You'd have no one to get the blasted thing from in the first place (which quite probably you didn't even want to begin with, but hell, everyone has one and you have to be like everyone else, eh?)!"

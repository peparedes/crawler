<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Woke up around 8 and left Ashkas with my mom to go to blue river in Indiana for a canoe trip that was 7 miles long, I paddled for 7 fuckin miles, and by the time we got done it was about..3. After that we had lunch at some lady's house out there and I fell asleep in the car until 4 when my mom came outside to leave. So we drove home and I called Blake when I got there to see if he was still comin over, he didn't know so I layed around and then he calls and says hes comin so I jump in the shower and get ready. Blake shows up around 8-8:30 and we just chilled in my room and looked at the yearbook b/c he knows a bunch of people from here, and around 10 my mom drove us to Ashka's house where nobody but us Ashka Patty Nikki n Michael had showed up yet so we just hung out until 11:30 when my mom picked us up, well my mom says goodnight and we sit on the porch til like 1, then David picks us up and takes us back to Ashka's. When we got there I took David Scav and Taylor back to the campfire and then me and Blake walked back when David was leaving like 10 minutes later and we ended up stayin at the house b/c Nikki was drunk off her ass, she was fallin all over the place, singin, takin off her clothes, she almost fell off the toilet one time, and just..goin crazy, but me and Blake ended up layin on the couch listenin to Keith Sweat-Nobody over and over and over again. Then around 2:30 we start callin Eddy to come pick us up, but umm, he was arguin with his parents so he said he would call back, he never called so we kept callin him, and he turned off his phone, yeah good, so...it's 2:30 in the mornin, we are stuck, and Blake lives allll the way out in J-town and had to work at 10 the next morning. So Patty was nice enough to drive us to my house where we were callin everybody to come get Blake but no one was awake or couldn't do it so we sit on the porch for awhile and then I put Blake in the basement on the recling chair with a blanket and my house phone to call his mom in an hour. I go upstairs to go to sleep and his mom calls sometime in the night, so I talk to her and go downstairs to get Blake and he leaves. </FONT></P>

"event","Ok yesterday was quite interesting! I worked, came home and thought I was in for the night cuz Paul never called me back when he said he would and I had no way of getting anywhere when Paul calls and says lets do somethin around 7, so I call Ash and got directions to the Henry County Fair.  Well me and Paul show up at like hmmmmmm 9 somethin, and I see this guy..holy shit..I drooled, and Nikki and Ash know him..wow..how great is that..so I smiled at him a lot haha! Then Nikki's little brother Austin stole Paul from me to ride rides and stuff so we got seperated several times but when we got back with each other me and Paul rode the little round and round thing...forgot what its called but we didnt get to talk very much.  Then Ash makes me ride this random thing with her that I told Paul I wouldnt ride and I screamed the whole time..like wow..I was FREAKING OUT, but then I get out and the outside screen on my phone is cracked and all purple and then my charms fell off of it but its just a phone right? Ok so around 11 me and Paul leave, and on the way home he asks me about my dad..oh boy..yeah long story there, then he ate at taco bell, took me home, made out, he left, and then I came outside to talk to Julie then we decide to go up the hill and see the new neighbors, then Julie thinks shes bad luck so Laura comes and walks with me and their dogs start following me, well it took like..oh 15 minutes for the boys to talk to us bc they are shy and even then the little boy Austin whos like 9 talked the whole time...I wanna babysit him sooo bad hes sooo adorable! Im his best friend! haha ok but then their little sisters friend calls me a slut hmm realll cool reall cool..so I asked her about it and she got all scared and denied it.  By this time it was like 3 in the mornin and I came inside and fell asleep.  I will do another entry on what happened to Erika and Erica tomorrow"

Then lets see..we just hung out and me and Erika went on a ride in the golf cart and she hit some tree branches, a curb, and we stole a pinwheel haahhahah that thing is hugeeeee then lets see....we layed out some blankets and looked at the stars for hours then around...oh..then Erika talks to bub and he says that I stabbed Ashley and Nikki in the back when they are the ones who wanna hang out with each other and not say anything to me or invite me or w.e so Im not gonna sit at home all the time and wait for them to call me with somethin to do so Erika and Erica invited me over so yeah of course I went, they dont have a problem with me so why shouldnt I? And I havent ahd that much fun in a longgg tiem so Im gonna keep hangin out with them as long as they want me to, and its not like I dont want to hang out with Ash n Nikki its just, Im not gonna invite myself over all the time and all that crap, if they wanted me to hang out with them, they would ask and they obviously dont so..w.e ok but anyways then we tryed to go to waffle house with paul and justin but erica wouldnt let us so we all just left and us 3 girls went to waffle house then by the time we got to Ericas house it was 6 in the mornin and we crashed, I didnt get up until 3 then went home and paul picked me up around 6 and we went to his house and played with his neices who are so adorable and soooo funny! then watched some fireworks and his dad got mad bc Paul took this wheel thing off the mailbox bc it was on fire and dropped this bead thing that he needed but Paul found it and it was alllll good but then Paul took me home at around 12 and now Im sittin here talkin to my girl JuLiE and about to go to bed!

"event","Well yesterday me and Erika both had to work and the car show was up in LaGrange so that was kinda cool, then this kid Trevor comes in the store at like..hmm 2 and doesnt leave til i closed at 5, but Erika left somewhere in there with Scott and Josh.  Then Trevor decided to walk me home and give me his number, yeah umm no thanks, so I got ready and then drove out to Ericas house.  First the party started reallll slow, everone left and I was the only one sittin at the house for like 20 minutes watching old music videos haha funny.  Then Cory Paul some random chick that lives across the street that was on Zanex? came over and told me if she was a guy she'd do me..ok..cool then Eddy..hahha Eddy...shows up again with some RANDOM ASS PEOPLE that no one knew..and these 2 girls but w.e we went with it, and Denmark John played beer pong all night, Pootie got TRASHED, some older guys came over, one of which is on the bomb squad in the army and is leaving for Iraq next sunday..aww soo sad..hes was just in Alaska..we thought that was cool..then lets see what else...Gian came and I sat by him the whole night pretty much til he left then I walked him to his car..hes got a niceeee car..I dont remember what it was but its really cool.  Then Joe and Stitch show up and brought some more stuff to drink, and for whatever reason Stitch has an obsession with hair, he kept rubbin the girls heads? lol hes cool though, and we listened to some of his beats cuz hes a DJ which is TIGHT I didnt get drunk last night tho, I had a somethin I cant pronounce and a bullfrog, that thing was good but, didnt do much.  Then like..everybody left and it was just me Erika, Erica, Joe Stitch, Alaska lol, Paul and Eddy, well Eddy finally leaves and then Joe and Stitch left and Erica stayed up all night talkin to Alaska, I had already fallen asleep on the couch when Paul wakes me up to see if I would go smoke with him and Erika cuz Erika wouldnt do it without me, but nope, that was a no go cuz I dont smoke, so Paul ends up fallin asleep with my feet layin across his lap and Erikas sleepin on the floor while Erica and Sean are havin this longggg conversation upstairs, and by morning Paul was up next to me and we were all up in each others faces lol.  We layed there for a while til Sean needed a ride back to his truck, then they left and we sat and watched TV and ate breakfast and Ericas dad did some cleaning. HAHAHAHAHAH then Erika falls on her ass omg it was soooo funny, she was steppin over this gate on Ericas guest bedroom door and..didnt make it all the way and just face plants into the floor haha I fell on the floor from laughin so hard.  And tonight Im supposed to meet Gian at The Vine and I really dont know whats gonna happen after that? I'll update this again later!"

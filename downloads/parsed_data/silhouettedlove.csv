I've got one guy who'd be great if all he stopped thinking about is sex. I mean, cmon its constant talk about it and to be quite honest im not that turned on about it. The way he talks about it makes me want to be a virgin longer... this kids gonna be like, we can go here and have sex or my house at 12 am and do it here. Im like Umm, hello...dude..no...you disgust me back the fuck off. Then there's another one who cant make up his mind about what he wants. He has a girlfriend yet hangs with his ex and has feelings for her. Then how can you say you love your current girlfriend and sit down and tell me how much we should hang out and how great of a person i am. Youre full of bullshit SIR. Sighs MEN ARE DIPSHITs.

I was pretty zoned out today, my eye twitched every 10 minutes. People asked me if i was high and was i ok. Im not ok!! Im tired, im overtired , if i get 4hours of sleep im lucky, but no luck here. I cuddled with Blanchard today, prolly one of the best parts of my day. Im not a happy camper. I had an unusual encounter today, i talked music with 3 people i particularly dont care for. It was good cause we liked alot of the same stuff. I could talk bands/music for days. Anyways, i love it when justin gets pissed at me, the face he makes when he is angry is soooooo adorable. I love it, it makes me wanna piss him off so i can see that face, his face becomes squeezed together and his lips pucker up...its so cute, then i have to apologize cuz i could never be mad at him or hurt him in anyway. IM SO SORRY HONEY!!!"

"event","Ok first off my day was so amazingly great. I love my job....after work 8:45-3, i went to get my eyebrows waxed and picked up mels' gift from target. My parents wanted to go shop for groceries so they went to Harris Teeter and i went to Dollar tree to pick mel up some inside joke gifts. When i was done, i ventured off to talk to jeremy...blah blah.. ok..so Adrian was working and justin was bagging, i was messing around with him and heh i was like i should give him my number, should i? and justins like if you want, and i was like should i? then he was like i dare you to, im like oh, OH! you dear me to?!?? well its on bia. So at the end of the transaction i was like Adrian, i got a cell phone.. you want me number.. he was like sure.. and my mom was like HE HAS A G/F why would he want ur number, he replied quickly, no i dont. So, i felt really good about that, riding the high the rest of the night b/c it just kept getting better.

Melodys party, i was about the 5th to arrive... well, i met DR.LOVE. What can i say? I want that! Hes like Mr. Perfect, although if we were to pursue stuff id get jealous of all his girls. Damn Pimp-atry. haha I met justin, didnt really wanna talk to him, but i did and we worked it all out and he was like you just reminded me of this girl who use to stalk me and i was like well, ya know...i was joking and you were going along with it and w/e. SO it was a miscommunication, i guess?? Holly arrived and thats when the goodness happened. It was just like old times. Im so glad we saw eachother.. thats my home girl right thurr. Haha. We danced, made guys jealous. lol. I met bryan, whos pretty cool. I met him at VTA's. I danced with all of them....more so Carlos and Bryan, wasnt really feelin Justin cuz i knew he like holly. I just knew it, im really clairvoyant about these things. When am i ever wrong... i rest my case. Honestly, they are such a great match and an even better couple. I honestly wouldnt mind talking to him some more and getting to know him, but w/e hes taken and im glad. I broke him of his anti relational thingamajigger. All kidding aside, me wanted carlos.. i gave him a back massage. We grinded and such. Talked. Had fun. It was all great, except for the part where i left and he was looking to say goodbye to me and i wasnt there. Im so pissed at myself. You guys have no idea. I didnt want it to end like that, but i took care of that already. I think Bryan likes me but iono. *shrugs* Its all cool. I met Ira, melody talks about him so much or use to. That guy is one of the hottest black guys i know. I was like yeah will u dance with bryan and he was like nah, i was like well how bout me and hes like yeah..so im like well then u owe me a dance and did we dance. WOW. he had some nice moves. Heh. Alright. But anyways, after all the guys left, justin was left there.. and he left at about 11;30 or so they thought, him and i were outside just shooting the breeze, i wanted to see his sentra. Im jealous of it but w/e i got my own. We were just talking and i wouldnt give him a hug and it was funny to see him beg. Im so evol. haha I ended up giving him a hug. Im glad him and holly 'go out.' Anyways, i cant wait for carlos to reply to my message thingy. And with all that type and said...and a few details missing that was my night. one of my most memorable nights. not too excited i have to go to work tomorrow at 2:30 and close. I hate doing exchanges and returns...its probably one of the hardest things. Tomorrow we are having some family and friends night so come in and get additional percentages off clothing or w/e. Great Xmas stuff!!! Come visit me, ill be in Juniors...pleaseeeeeeeee lol anyways, im outie"

Decisions and motives wane within the mind until all rationality is slightened away. By this time, that thing by which we call chance, or coincidence, has already determined what we like to label fate. It's naturally possible to personally generate or at least influence outcomes, and even easier to take no action. But know this, that if no action is taken, actions will surely make themselves in natural course of cause. We cannot naturally dwell on circumstances forever, and its debatable whether these lost causes are not yet a part of a bigger climax.

Before first block nobody was in there except for the hot kid so Catherine and I stayed outside and he came out there and was like, it feels odd being in the class alone you dont mind me standing here with you...and i was like of course not...wait yea leave joking around. I told him i liked his converses, that they talked to me. It was funny. We got some time to talk about a good 10 mins. Hes pretty cool. WAY to nice i think. 1st block ALEX and Mike pissed me off... I swear guys can be jerks sometimes. 2nd block with the day-inator. We talked about old people and senile, I hope that doesnt become me. I hope i dont go through menopause..we are talking about young, middle, and late adulthood. Its rather depressing. We have a project due and we have to plan our lives up to our death and talk about how we die. *shrugs* lots of thought. 3rd block was fun we took a test that didnt count and we played 4 corners and heads up 7 up. Kyle is sick..poor thing i wish he was better, hes just not his self. 4th block got 2 100's on a test, have a 4.0 in there. Hurrah. Umm then 1/2 the block we had a pep rally. One of the cheerleaders fell and all u heard was a really loud thump. It was kinda horrible yet i laughed at her misfortune. What can i say, im evol. We watched the African Americans do a native dance. That was it really. I came home and i find out i gotta work Wednesday 5 to 9. So much for my use to be life. Im going to have to pay room and board which sucks major butt..why? I dont wanna! NO its my money, you cant take it away.  I could sit here for hours on end giving you pros and cons of working but i dont wanna depress myself anymore. Im sorta looking foward to it but then again id prolly get my period and become a makjor bitch and get fired my first day. I doubt ill go to Melodys party with this crappy job. I have to take out 6 of my earrings. I have to clean tomorrow, and i feel like im coming down with something. Who knows maybe ill grow deathly ill. We are probably going to fly the dog so i wont get her until december which will suck, who knows maybe my dad will bring up enough stamina to drive for 10 hours straight to get her on the 20th. 

Dad and i played a rousing game of bloody knuckles. We both got some pretty good whacks in. Id say he ruled in that game, but i won the slap game. I got him good. Payback for the knuckels shall we say. His left hand was so red it looked like a few more whacks and it would have bled. My knuckles dont hurt except for where i hit the table trying to hit him. I got a little cut and my right ring finger is sore. Ill live but id say we are equal and it got out a little frustration between us both. I laugh. Anyways, im outie"

I found it Thank god. I was so relieved. Justin yelled at me for no reason, when ever he is in a bad mood he always takes it out me. Well lets say ill be the bigger person and ignore him. Im serious..whenever he is mad, he takes it out on me, i dont need people like that around me. 3rd block me and this chick are gonna get into a fight because she is ignorant. we call her butterball, we plan on donating her to the hungry starving kids for thanksgiving. 4th block was boring, had a butt load of dr.ed stuff to do. Anyways, im so tired. Its only 6 and im totally drained. I just wanna sleep and never wake up.. Not meaning anything like morbid but i am so tired.

"event","Today wasnt a bad day overall. Yes, melissa and nick go out but hey...its all good. Shrugs. 1st block we spent most of the time going over wks and i got a 92 on a quiz. Ive come to the conclusion, i am not a ""logical"" geomerty thinker, person. I am more an Algebra ""irratonalist"". We all have our weaknesses and that is one of mine. I will make do with a high C. 2nd block wasnt too shabby. We worked on our maze and i made the design... didnt need any help with the wall designs other than the tapping. We were all goofing off i didnt think wed have time to finish. I was jokin the Danish girl, Sarah the hill billy princess and justin the fag, it was ok cuz Justin was jokin how i talk... Sarah, omg i put tape in her hair! it was funny... we were al laughin and i was like, i heard u fart!! HAH Then it carried on from there..good times.. we both were thinking alike and said the same word at the same time.. that deserved a backhand high5. 3rd block took the test and got an 83, man, i made some careless errors....maybe i should read slowly and more carefully. I made such stupid errors its not even funny. I was embarrassed. 4th block, PE was RAD! Yesh i know, PE right!! 1/2 our class..the bad half is in the simulator and the rest of us are outside doing track and field, i dont run...but ill do the field stuff. We did shot put and discus...omg WHAT FUN!! I always wanted to do that, no joke!!! It is alot harder than it looks. Talked to Jacob alot... hes kinda cool when hes not around jeremy. I missed kyle at lunch, no hugs from him.. tear tear.. oh well chris gave me hugs and i got petted by nick,melissa,sarah, and chris.. then kenny came up and like scared me so that was the end of petting. Yeah.. thats about it... hmm so close to buying a dog..but noooooooooooo <^> damn dad...w/e we'll get one soon. IM OUT!"

"event","I called Jason last night. I dont care what my parents have to say, they have been very aggrivating these past few days. If the computer was upstairs in MY room, id never come out. Anyways, the baseball game was on while i called him... *go BOSTON* i was somewhat distracted. I think his mom picked up the phone and i was like umm, hello....is jason there.. i was nervous but when he came on the phone, thats when it all began. I was really,really, nervous. I was fidgety the whole time. He has the sexiest voice ever. We all know how much i love deep voices. I could listen to him talk all day..thats how great his voice is. *sighs* yeah. We talked for a good 1/2 hour. I felt like i talked to much but he says i didnt..im like ok.. w/e lol. I wouldnt mind calling him more often. I dont wanna get him in trouble thought. Im going to have to show him some baby pictures...haah anyways

On to today...it was fairly decent...i got another 120 on a quiz in psychology..and 87 in geometry and i got a history test tomorrow which should be a piece of cake...cuz its on NAPOLEON!!!! I love history.. anyways...in psychology i got really pissed of at my group because they would not listen to me and were contradicting me any chance they got. I told them how we should make this maze and then they were like it wont work and said the same thing and ""someone"" took it as their idea. Really pissed me off. Yeah, we settled that shit right then and their... justin asked me if i didnt like lindsey and i think he got mad cuz of my respond...him and i are on thin ice i think..shit hasnt bee the same. Me and this girl in my history class, we are going to go at it...fist on fist if she keeps snappin at me..Nobody likes her..except for her black friends..who i cant stand either. I wish the teacher would separate them so we could actually learn something without being inturrupted. Drivers ed was interesting...Blanchard is funny... as is pete.. they were messing around, joking eachother. We played Jeopardy and the other team was whining about how they always lose, so they told us to go first and we still won..shit was sooo hilarious. 1st block is kinda boring, but she kept leaving the room so we had time to ourselves to talk...and being me i took full advantage of it and had everybody laughing their asses off. Just saying stuff... about anything... i told Lace to write a note and everyother line was or something...pretty interesting. The teacher gave us an ass load of transparencies to do and she had enough so everybody had to anwser and she was like has everybody had a chance to anwser and i called baron out....it was priceless..he flicked me off and got me at lunch. Nick was messing around with all the teenyboppers, the kid is 19 still in highschool and is messing around with 15-17 year olds... *sighs* what a loser..Kyle left early so i didnt get to smell him, his cologne smells sooo good.. that i could just sit there and smell him for days. Its kira from pac sun. I think it turns me on. haha Chris's boobs were hard... haha i started to joke him and he undid my bra... i was like holy shit. It was funny...guess you had to be there...


Came home, shit hit the fan..people just love to bitch at me. C-rock came over, he chilled, ate dinner, and left. Had to run to the dollar store to pick up baby wipes for xtra credit and some tape for our maze. Anyways, im done now. Ill write later"

Well, the search is on to find a dog. I have been extremely busy calling all over the world trying to find the perfect dog, just when we are getting really close to closing the deal, something happens. Either its not the right dog, or we find something better. I think my dad is done with all the bullshit and just wants a dog. We are looking at this one called Priscilla, of course we arent going to call her that but ya. 

We got our Mouse, Pumpkin Escobar today. He is adorable. Black and sleek. He took to Justin well, i think thats because hes a male, and so is pumpkins, either that or we have a gay mouse. LOL JK!! haha So yeah, we bought him treats but he didnt like them.. hmpf, 6 dollars on treats and he doesnt like them. Well screw u mouse, u wont get nothing.

I went to the Chevelle show, fucking awesome. I know what ur thinking...but dude they were great. The first band Mute Math sucked, the drummer was totally sexy, needless to say i got his drumstick. I thought then 2nd band pwned, Hidden In Plain View. They sounded like bitches but were sexy as hell. The lead singer looked like gunter but only sexier, not saying gunter is sexy. The drummer and guitarist were hot to. They had the flipped hair type thingy. Then Chevelle came on and i got into a fight with some douche bag...she apologized to me so that was cool, damn straight you stupid hoe. HA! Well, yesh, i kinda got in the pits...all these guys who were sweaty and smelly kept rubbing on me and i cant get the stink out. (LOL SARAH) HAH After that, I saw Mike and he humped me, he was like shhhh dont tell my g/f cough i was like ok, yeah w/e mhm. HAHA. Then we blasted some LOG as we left and got rallys and a slurpee. Good times.
Hmm, got 2 A's a B and a C on my report card, damn creasy's class... i swear im going to make her cry... my dad told me to call her a douche bag and make her cry and im like well how do i do that?? Call her a stupid cunt, whos a fucking dried up feebeled ass women who is a shit eating cock knocker cuntasauras rex??? he was like, w/e u do just make her cry...haha ok. daddy! I WILL! hahah

I know im forgetting stuff but what can i say its almost 12 at night.. and i gotta sleep.

I havent updated in awhile! WOW. So school blows.. lunch is probably the best thing going right now, except for when Chris, Kyle and all of them grab my spots. I pushed kyle up against the wall and licked him. It happens, *shrugs*. I took some quizzes and tests.. did very well on them, no complaints..im going for straight A's this semester, shouldnt be too hard. I got 2 A's 1 B and a C in geometry but what can i say, the bitch hates me. Yesterday i went out to eat with C-rock and jeremy, we had some fun...we had painful hot wings, they were not that hot. That was pansy stuff. I wanna go to the mall and spend my money. I want to pick up some shirts. Then go to target and pick up some pants. I also have to go to petsmart and buy cages and water for our experiment. We are raising a mouse..for psychology, should be fun... im going to bring cheese, our mouse is going to be the smartest and he is going to be named PUMPKIN ESCOBAR SQUEEZLE_DEMUS. Yeah, we are in the process looking for a new dog, sharpei perhaps. I cant fucking wait, i am looking all over for one. *sighs* yeah. IM really tired but anyways, just a quick update......

"event","Ok, so yesterday was my bday and my brother took me out to eat and go see Lamb Of God, Children of Bodom, Fear Factory, and Throwdown. Shit fucken pwned. Dinner was pretty good, had to hurry up and eat because we wanted to get back there earlier. We ended up waiting about an hour in a cramped hallway and started talking to this dude, he was pretty cool..we had some entertainment with these redknecks in the back of the line, it was funny the things they were sayin. We are waiting for Throwdown to come on, im not even going to lie but when the drummer took off his shirt i wet my pants.. That guy was so fucken hot, he had a tatoo all over his chest. It was pretty hot and the fact he was sweaty was just a bigger turn on. They were pretty good, i dont remember much of their songs but i liked what i can remember. Some guy was hitting on me, i wasnt really interested thank god my cousin came over so i started to talk to him while i left that kid to my brother to talk. BODOM took the stage, wow dude... they would have been better if the mic was up louder, the guitars and keyboard drowned him out. None the less GREAT. My cousin and i teamed that shit up..he knew what the fuck was up and so did i. Fear factory came on, long set short.. they sucked.. i dont care what anyone says... they sucked. The guy tried singing, his voice cracked..it sounded like a bad senace gone wrong. He looked like he was 50 years old trying.. couldnt sing. Disappointment. Hey i wasnt there for them, i was expecting them to be better. After all that crap happened, the band i wanted to see finally came on!! LAMB OF GOD, what a fucking awesome band and set. He brought the goodage. He was fucking amazing..chimaira was better. The lead singer started crowd surfing and touched peoples hand, he worked the center stage more than the left or right which kinda bummed me out. Still great. There was this really hot kid behind me before LOG came on. He was a little taller than me and had these brown pretty eyes and was wearing a dickies hat. I was hitting on him and he touched my ass alot.. haha it was funny. I was gonna give him my number but i didnt have a pen.. DAMN, i know right. Oh well. Whatever. That shit was awesome. Goodnight. I got 2 tshirts, a Bodom one and LOG one...my cousin said the LOG shirt i picked out they sell at Hot Profit (topic) Damn, im fucking mad...im checking that shit out this weekend. I hope not. ill be really really pissed. I should have gotten the one for Ashes of the Wake, but no i had to get the ""gay"" one. Oh well, i still fucking rock that shit. 
Today was a busy day, i helped with the blood drive signing people in and fanning the passed out people. Did that all 1st block missing Creasy's test, lace wrote me the anwsers for that so im good there. 2nd block was crazy, she gave blood and i think was a little woozy, so we really didnt do much other than copy notes and got showed what our final grade was for the semester. B here. 3rd block had to write an essay. 4th block i left, i got home around 2:40 and slept. Then sarah called me and we went to the library to study for the psats. Shits going to be long and hard...oh well, im out now. Later

I did have fun. I didnt like how my cousin isolated himself with the girls and huey. Whatever. I knew it was going to happen. I only invited them so he wouldnt be bored. I got some stuff. Sarahs present was the best, she got me the Atreyu cd a Jay figuerine, and a 10 dollay Giftcard to Target. Go her. She helped me alot which i am really greatful for. She helped me decorate and tried blowing up ballons....keyword tried, i blew up 12 before she got one..and she still didnt get it. That was funny. People left and we cleaned up and it didnt take long...Justin brought sushi, i love him for that. His present came in 2nd hahaahaha. IM such a horrible person by rating them. Arent i? lol Well, i officially turn 16 tomorrow. Holly, Stephen, Melody, Lisa, and Aron are suppose to be giving me my presents tomorrow...or in the mail...we will see!!

"event","Well, today wasnt the baddest. It was pretty good during 2nd block. Sarah gave me 2 pills of aderol to make me forget the pain. I was geekin. I was so fucked up. I was laughing so hard, the sub almost kicked me out. Sarah would look at me and id laugh for no reason. The other sarah was giving me, im ashamed look. My legs went numb and i almost tripped.. im so graceful. I was so fidgety...if only you could have seen me. I was wired. I was kicking my legs up and playing peek a boo with them. I couldnt write fast enough. What a thrill. Lunch, everyone was surrounding me and i freaked out..bryan wouldnt stop following me around and i freaked out. Sarah asked me to hold her lunch so i stood there shaking her drink the whole time.....it almost exploded, i shook it so hard. I was cold to the touch but i was hot. I talked to amanda...she wanted to know how i felt...so i told her. Dude, im like wired still...not as bad.... that was hilarious.... i had to read and i was reading with a lot of inflection, someone asked me is that how i really read...and then called me worse some.... but they liked my reading! hahaha

I bought some birthday crap...im going to streamer the place and put ballons everywhere..shits going to be badass. The people who cant come are going to miss out on one hell of a party. Thats all i can say.
Sarah doesnt know this yet but she is going to help me... clean the house and decorate....and choose the music. We need a nice variety to make everyone happy.

I might work the concession stand for the craft show...we'll see. I have an ass load of make up work.. i failed a test....and have another tomorrow, i need to study. I wrote an essay comparing and contrasting absolute monarchs and democracy. OO i won a keychain/flashlight/whistle from anwsering a question, and a foamy hard hat for anwsering another question. Anyways, im gone for now...........peace."

Well, i wanted a hug and kiss...ya know and shes like i dont wanna be loved on and going into great depth about all her homework. Well, i was pissed cuz i didnt get my hugs and kisses. So i told her to go fuck  herself and i flicked her off and told her to never talk to me again...and ran upstairs. I fell asleep...zoom to the next morning. She wakes me up around 6:50 and says goodbye i love you...im like oh yeah, w/e. Then fall back to sleep. She leaves. I wake up at 7:01 start makin my bed, the phone rings...all i hear in the background is a person breathing or trying to.. and a lady going *im so sorry im so sorry* ...i was scared. I was like MOM!!! WHATS WRONG?!??!? She tries to tell me with gasping breath. She said ive been in a car accident, i fly down the steps and tell my father .... and i lost the connection never finding out where she was... I run outside in my underwear to see if she is anywhere in sight. The phone rings...dad anwsers it, i zoom upstairs put on my pants and scurry downstairs...dads getting ready to leave..im in hysterics crying and everything all these what ifs pop into my head... i thought i was going to pass out. He told me i couldnt come..im like I NEED TO GO!! hes like No...stay home....he finally says i could come and not but 1/4 of a mile is my mom ...and the brand new lincoln, 04 luxury town car... back end ruined..lisense plate folded into quarters. Glass everywhere...lights broken...trunk ruined.....my mom cant even move from her position. I had so many thoughts...i wanted to kill the lady who did it and then beat the fuck out of her when she was dead...i wanted to tell my mom im  so sorry, just everything ya know. What if she didnt make it?.. Well the ambulance came 10 minutes later (someone could have died in that interval of time) they had to put her on a stretcher and take her to the emergency room. I got to ride in the ambulance..the driver..didnt wear his seatbelt, drove with one hand the whole time...switching it from his coffee and the radio tuner.. i was like UM! HELLOO my mom was just in a fucking accident and here you are..driving and shit..wtf? Foward now to the hospital...they almost dropped her..twice...ALMOST. She was dry heaving and crying still...back spasms and all. Nurse came in blah blah blah then 20 minutes later the dr. praticioneer came in and said Xrays..another waiting of 40 mins..and more waiting...everything seems to be ok...shes pretty fucked up though...7-12. We get her home...i have to help her upstairs and run up n down when she needs stuff. She was not at fault.. she was stopped to turn left ...traffic was on coming...the lady had to have been going a good 55 mph...in a 25mph zone..there is a nice skid mark path..she was not cited a ticket nor was she checked for Driving under the influence...its pretty fucked up. I am so tired, it has been a long day. On the lighter side, while she was sleeping i managed to go Ci Cis and eat a whole BBQ pizza....the great void of depression was filled for a moment. Then i spent my 15 dollars at an arcade and played pool and air hockey..and some racing games...i do love them...and played packman. I won air hockey but lost at pool..i was just warming up what can i say...im deffintely going back and playing some more...."

Why do I hold these strong feelings toward you...and more so, why do we throw the love word around? Ah Fuck it, what IS love anyways...I know not what it is.



Today sucked. I had a headache that made me feel zombie like. Someone told me i looked tired, it was just a nicer way of telling me i looked like shit. Thanks. The crypt keeper passed out our quiz and test, i got a 77 on the quiz and a 78 on the test. What such luck. Im so smarter than this. I asked her could i do some extra credit, she said no. I did my homework and goofed off. Its what im best at. 2nd block, The lesbian was not there. I dont think i could have put up with her today...Ms. Day is a psycho bitch. We had a sub and ended up doing some stupid drawing. I scribbled a stick person and colored some stuff. Again I goofed off making some weird noises and telling everyone how sarah kicked me out of her house. Justin kissed me, then licked my neck and cheek. He is like a dog. Third block Megan pissed me off. Preppy ass cheerleader. Im going to stick my gum in her hair by the end of the semester. She thinks she is better than everyone else. Id gladly take her on. She is really getting on my last nerve, she is one of those people who like to hear themselfs talk and because she is in pride, she is god. Well, news flash bitch, ill kick yer ass fuck with me some more. 4th block was good, I talked to Ben. Invited him to my party. We were in the same group. His pants fell down and i saw his green boxers..then david came into the picture and showed us his blue boxers and they had a ""my boxers are better than yours"" discussion. Pretty interesting. I stayed after for Art Club. It seems i am in a club this year. No more Drama Club..im relieved. I thought i was going to be clubless this year. (makes any sense) There was only 4 people including myself. I took the initiative to be the pet. I wanna see if i can hold an office, thus look good on college applications. We made 2 humongus signs for people to join, ours says: ""Stop!! Defacing school property and put your graffiti skills to use, Join art club"" haha It looks fucking awesome. I might help out during the Craft Show this saturday with the concession stands. My party is also saturday, i can toggle it. *hopefully* I will talk to mom and see what she says. I might have to stay after tomorrow if i cant finish the sign....ill see if i can do it in the morning. I also have to pass out flyers for people interested in the club. *sigh of relief* I didnt have much homework and what i did have, i didnt do because its drivers ed and i will copy it from someone else. I took my shower and here i am..completely drained physically,mentally, and emotionally. There is something wrong, my mind is a blank canvas. Someone paint it."

I could fall asleep for days on end. My mom and dad discussed my party. Its deffinitely NOT fair. I mean come on, my party their time,place,food, and amount of people. I have well over 15 people i want to invite. They told me 10. I made a big stink about it and my dad was like well then we dont have to have a party afterall, there is nothing thats written down that says you need to have a party. I was about to say fuck you, i dont want anything from you..take yer tickets back and fuck off. I was so pissed. He came around though and said i could invite 13/14..but my mom made 16 invitations so we will see. I wanted it the 16 he said the 9th. RAH!!!! Whatever. Ill stop talking about it cuz its making me mad. 

I listened to the new Chevelle cd all day. Its good, but deffinitely not worthy like the Wonder Whats Next cd. Something is missing from it. I dont know.

My dad made me call about some dogs..we are deffintely getting one in the near future. It will be a bitch, im so anxious. I want a new dog bad... perhaps along with the car i will get a dog."

I dipped from there and ended up coming home..man was i glad to be home. I had to choose between Megans party or Ambers party. I deffinitely chose Ambers. I got a bottle of Orange Vodka all to myself. I was fucking happy. We went up to her room and had some drinks..We ended up watching Kill Bill 1 and 3 of the people had to leave.. so it was me and les with her sisters.. we were geekin around. Everyone was messin with les, it was pretty funny. I dont really care for him so when i say everyone,it excludes me. We had fun. I was not stuck at home sodding off. Deffinitely had a busy weekend, tomorrow i will relax..catch up on stuff. Ill have more busy weekends seeing how Amber is going to do it every Saturday and I will be attending concerts pretty damn soon. They include Children of Bodom, Lamb Of God, Fear Factory, Throwdown, and Chevelle. Yeah PWNAGE FUCKERS!!! CANT WAIT.. Bday is in 8 days! 



Went to the mall last night, picked up James Pattersons ""Four Blind Mice"" that book was 5.99 marked down..It was originally 30 dollars. Also, got the new Chevelle cd.. Ownage on that one. Its great..better than point number one, not as good as the other one. Im so anxious to see what i got on the Crypt Keepers test. Probably another C or D.

The quiz i thought i got an A/B i got a C that bitch is a bitch...Bitch. Yeah, so I took another quiz in her class and cheated yet again.

My jason is way better...really really really. Anyways, My day was fairly well...I met another new person named Mar...shes pretty cool. I hung out with Anna today, shes bummed cuz Matt is moving..it sucks we will miss him greatly. 5 minutes before the bell rang i went over and hung with ""the groupies"" i got me a hug from carlos!! hahah It was great..i think he is secretly gay..or confused. Oh well. Mike is pissed at me for no reason. He wont talk to me, i feel really bad....i dont know what to do..i tried talking, i wrote him a note, and now im going to call him when he gets off work...if this doesnt work then fuck him..he can go fuck himself. I took a quiz in geometry, i think i got an A/B. I definitely passed my Honors History test with a nice big 100! thats right folks...total ownage on that test. Psychology was interesting, we are talking about dreams..we have to keep a dream journal...i think i will bullshit most of it because then people will know how demented and really fucked up i am. Ha. Yeah Pe was pretty fun...we did the normal routine and jess and i walked the track..2 times. She wont be there tomorrow so im all to myself. :(  I might skip...Im not sure yet. My abs are hurting and so are my shoulder blades. We did the pull up tests and V shit (sit) and reach. I was the highest with a nice 8.5 inches but jess beat me by 9, its cool though...i havent stretched like that in ages...it felt damn good, i feel like my torso is elongated. Heh. Tomorrow is going to be total ownage, i cant wait till my meeting at 6:30....Yeah..  I went to the mall today.. bought me a cd.. for 4 dollars and found some killer fucking shoes that were 16 dollars, i backed away from buying them. What can i say im a jew, who loves her money. HA Seriously, i will go back to the mall this weekend and if they are there then its fate..if not something better will come along, but these shoes fucking owned. Those shoes brought the goodage. Im tired but wanna stay up for jeremy so i can talk him into lettin me borrow his severed savior shirt. Later kids, im going to go..

"event","School was iffy today. 1st block sucked because the crypt keeper was back. She gave us an ass load of work to do. She shows no mercy. 2nd block was great, except, well there was a bee in there...and i was freaking out. I bombed a quiz, i dont study. Other than that moderately normal. 3rd block, my teacher read my essay to the class, i felt special. I worked really hard on it considering the fact i was having trouble. We had a test, i really couldnt focus it was way too hot and i made stupid errors. Hopefully it isnt too low and i can use all my extra credit. I got like 20 points racked up for extra credit. Maybe i can take a retest. Oh well, not worried about it. 4th block pe, it wasnt 1/2 bad, the teacher and i have formed this sorta bond. She can totally relate, this is why i love women teachers. We played football...im a great passer!! Im going pro! haha No not really. Yeah. I was coming out of the gym and ran into this kid who said to me ""whats up metal head"" i was like hell yea dude. You know whats up. Yeah, so i talked to the other Justin today finally and i really dont know what to think, he use to impress me but now, i dont know..its odd. Jeremy (a friend of hollys) is suppose to call me tonight. Odds are he wont, or forget. Sarah liked the Head Automatica, i was shocked. She wants me to burn her a copy, how sweet is that! I hung out at lunch today with some people...then a whole nother flock came over and it was like huddle around alyssa day. *sighs* damn groupies. They are cool dont get me wrong, but how many of them can actually say that they know me? They dont. I just wish i had one realiable friend at lunch whom i could talk with. Anyways, im done...

Charles and I hung out today...ran some errands. I exchanged a necklace. He sang to me, Ashley Simpson. Heh. It was awesome.

I ran errands with mom and dad. We went to Cosco, and i bought a supplies of Gum to last me till christmas. Hopefully. We went to Harris Teeter, where my mom says Jeremy (the Cashier) was checking me out. It happens. Haha. He definitely has a great smile. I think hes shy..not sure though. Then we went to the dollar general where i managed to pick up some nescessities: a hair straightening iron, deoderant, and a dry erase board. We went to sallys and i knocked over some display full of hair dye. Go me. The lady ended up cleaning it while i scurried off to find some hair stuff. Yeah, it happens. Mike called me last night, i wish he wouldnt. I only want to be friends, nothing more. I dont have the balls to tell him...maybe i should. Whatever..i just need someone to talk to, i think its time for another mommy and daughter talk. Tomorrow, she might take me on the interstate..that should be fun, me breaking 45 mph and merging.. its going to be kick ass. If i can do that i can conquer anything. HAH. That is IF she takes me."

Yesterday the hot kid said goodbye to me.. he would have said hi but our teacher has a no talking policy which sucks. She reminds me of the crypt keeper from Tales of the Crypt. I hung out with Charles and Jezza yesterday, some of it was fun some of it wasnt. They introduced me to April, she looked like Kristen Dunst. Pretty cool, she seemed nice. Im currently unattainable!! Yesh thats right folks! I got myself a lover. Hahah. We wanted to go skating but im the ""horriblest"" skater (as i put it) so we decided to chill at the mall. Good times are yet to come. Thats about it.. C-rock is suppose to come to lunch for Kerri today, i hope he stays for my lunch cuz i dont wanna hang out with the dorks again...they get annoying and start following behind you like groupies.

I was a pimp today, some guy asked me if i wanted to skip and make love in his car. Wtf?!? i know right. I passed that up. Then, I was mad flirtting with Carlos. Katie and Sarah says i should tell him whats up, i think i might. In 4th block, Ben asked to be my partner. He asked me.. i was shocked big time.  We had a fun time... i guess it was drivers ed work..not much fun. 

Then i came home, did me some homework. Chilled around and got Mcdonalds. I complimented the guy on his belt and i was tryna look to see his face, but i couldnt. My mom says he was hot and that he was checking me out. Alright i guess. I noticed ive been very sarcastic lately. I got a little cold, i have a stuffed up nose but nothing comes out...i feel like i have been drinking all night and somebody slammed a bat in my head. I gauged another hole...i got a 16 and a 10.

I found 2 new bands i like to add to my many artists list.... Spill Canvas and Greeleyestate. Pretty awesome..check em out.

Today 1st block I had a quiz, i think i did really good...possible 95. 2nd block we had a sophomore assembly, i got some nominations for homecoming. I saw Sammy, Again! We sat together and she was laying on me and we were fooling around. She kept biting me and tickling me. People now assume we are lesbians. Alright! Go Us. Then I made it to 2nd block, drenched from the rain. (portables) Back out in the rain again, and then to 3rd block where we carved potatoes for the guttenburg printing press. It was pretty complicated...mine came out a big blue blob. Lunch was great, i was hanging around Josh, Aaron, Mike, Melissa, Anna, and someother dudes. Mike was pretending to mosh and ran into us...then some big tall cop'r dude came over and he hid behind Anna. Pretty funny. I bit Aarons nipple and lost my gum while attempting it. It was pretty funny..I love that kid. Then i saw Cat and she told me she had to switch cuz she made GSA. I was like go you and we began to talk. I ran into Brandy and i was like i want your man, nick. Hes so hot and shes like hes not my man, we dont go out anymore...i was like really and shes like yeah besides im pregnant and i was like psh no way, she was like way and told me to feel her stomach...*aww* it was so precious..but sad...1st time sex, pregnant. What luck. She told me she goes friday for the sex determination...she has lupis, i hope her baby will be ok. Anyways, 4th block test for drivers ed. *EWW* i hate that crap. It was like fill in 38 blanks.....no help nothing. I hung out with sarah and melissa and katie only to see Carlos. Man he was looking good today. Oh yeah. That kid brings the hotness. Hes got these pretty brown eyes...like a puppy dogs only warmer. I want that kid too! Why not me? Justin said he was going to try and call tonight but im not getting my hopes up..i got a wickid headache and my dad wants to run out all over the place for glass coke bottles...what luck.

The only thing good about that class is looking at this kid Johnathan, although he is on the opposite side of the classroom. Psychology was pretty fun, im in the group with Justin. I love that kid, hes my number 1 fag. Literally. He's like i think you dont like me anymore..i was like Lindseys all over you..you only have time for her. I really dont like her but i dont dislike her. Shes all over my gay man. Its going to be on. 3rd Block was pretty cool, More group work activity..that class is way too easy for an honors class. I feel like i am just wasting my time learning the same redundant crap over and over. Im tired of learning about religion. Theres so many fucking beliefs that im going to start my own, its going to be called i dont give a shit. I seriously get tired of learning about Catholicism, Christianity, Protestant, and all the other fake ass bull. Anyways, I got an on campus field trip tomorrow. Missing 3rd block...we have to take a survey of the school for psychology. Anyways, back to the day.. 4th block, i had my speech all planned out for the trexler but i ended up going to the simulator!! Dude, i almost shat my pants, i really dont like that thing. Im barely going to pass it, i feel it coming! WAHAHAH The teacher is so boring. They tell you to park it and then put it in drive and then say put it in gear and drive. You have to push really hard on the gas seeing these ""vehicles"" are over 12 years old, so ya know your going to mess up there. 
Sarah made me listen to the buffy musical cd. Thats a level of faggotry we wont even get into, then she has the audasity to tell me Chimaira sucks, Arch Enemy sucks, and all alike. Id rather listen to some fucking GAYFI, BACKSTREET, or RAP. Im so tired...anyways, im leaving. Peace

i took her to an empty house in westchester i had already picked up.
when we got there i told her to wait outside, pick wild flowers.
i went upstairs and stripped all of my clothes off.
i knew if i did not i would get her blood on them.
when all was ready i went to the window and called her.
then i hid in the closet until she was in the room.
she saw me all naked and began to cry and tried to run downstairs.
i grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama.
first i stripped her naked.
how she did kick bite and scratch.
i choked her to death.
then i cut her into small peices so i could take my meat to my room, cook 
and eat it.
it took me nine days to eat her entire body.
i did not fuck her.
though i could have as i wished.
she died a virgin



















the soiled ground for the sacrifice
dispelled. crippling. faulty. holyland.
i am your martyr, your stigmata
the tears turn to blood beneath my eyes.
my body listens... as you whisper
my fingers bend... as im nailed to your cross.
the splinters etch... hearts in my back
i denounce this crucifixtion, i demand another sacrifice.
a cast shadow over this narrow hill
pulling my fingers from these nails
there will be no use for a second comming"

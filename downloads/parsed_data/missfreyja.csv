"event","Well, last night Liz was supposed to come over and get drunked up with us but didn't. She had a headache all day and decided not to, so maybe next weekend. In any case, Graeme and I got way fucked up (well atleast I did anyway). He had gone out earlier in the day and got crisps and dip, some cognac and ginegr ale for him, and a bottle of Jager for the both of us. Until I had seen the bottle of Jager I had my mind set on Spiced rum and Dr. Pepper. Well! Ok, so I indulged a wee bit too much in the Jager and got way fucked up haha, but I didn't hurl(much to my surprise). I have mastered the art of no hangover! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE much drunken tom-foolery to ensue next Friday night should Liz choose to accept the challenge."

"event","I got your hat today, it's lovely! And thank you for the 3Musketeers and scarf as well. The hat and scarf will go nicely with my newest winter coat, which is also pink. It's feeling a bit like spring here at the moment so I can't wear it till next autumn/winter, but very much looking forward to it. Don't forget to email me a list of things you might like. <3 If you prefger something homemeade and crafty, I make these window cling things that look like stained glass, but are a soft pliable plastick and can be removed and moved around as many timers as you like. I can make you some if you wish, and tell me what kinds of things you like, like flowers, butterflies, what animals, fruits, things like that. (I use different patterns and havent evolved to freehand yet but could try it lol) If youd be interested in something like that I can do that as well =)"

"event","Guess what I'm doing tonight with my hubby away at friends house? Dancing around the kitchen with sharp knives in my hands and doing dishes to Duran Duran. Since I've completed that task, I am now spending quality time with a bottle of Glenfiddich next to my computer, while still listening to Duran Duran. I know, gay, a lot of you will say, but Duran Duran has been through some memorable bits of my life with me, so why not? It's fun to reminisce sometimes. Anyway, off to drunkie land I go, and boy will my husband be surprised lol..."

"event","Yeah. Haven't updated in a while, but usually I have nothing to update with anyway, so it's of no consequence.

About 3 months ago the cleaning ladies and janies across Scotland went on strike for something that all people, or women as it may be, should have been involved in, but only the janies and cleaners, and canteen ladies were involved in. It was about equal pay, apparently. About a month after the strike, the rest of the carers got letters saying we were getting some money regarding this, based on hours and time of employment with the council. For 6 months employment with the council, I got a decent amount. I did a little shopping, and I'm also getting an ye examination and new glasses. The rest will be saved for sustainment during the summer since I won't be working then. In anycase, this money was a total surprise to me, so I was happy about it, to say the least =D Today I'm expecting my clothes, and sometime this coming wek I should have some new shoes, then Thur I go for my eyes. I can't wait for my new glasses.

Anyway, guess that's all for now.Hope everyone is happy, safe, and healthy."

"event","Ok, just had some Jagermeister, starting the birthday festivities a few days early. And why the fuck not? Jager is good for any day drinking anyway. Was listening to Emperor Prometheus and it reminded me of.. well, a year ago when I was drinking every night through the stress, and just kinda made me wanna drink.. haha! And so I did, and so I shall continue. Weee!!"

"event","I feel like I am surrounded,
abandoned, shut out, closed in. 
There's no way out of this.

Blackness is all I can see.
Emptiness - nothingness.
Is anyone out there ?

I cry but no one hears.
I move but no one sees.
I touch, but no one feels.

Did I make this hell for myself?

I cry but no one hears...
my voice just echos.
I move but no one sees...
my shadow just shifts.
I touch but no one feels...my finger tips just go numb.

My head is pounding.
My heart is aching.
I am longing for some company;
longing to be held,
longing to be loved.
Aching to be acknowledged.
Am i still alive?

Did I make this hell for myself?"

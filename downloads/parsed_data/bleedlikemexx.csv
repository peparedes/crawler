It is such a terrible thing to happen. When I first heard, I didn't believe it. I guess it's the most deadly shooting rampage in US history. Terrible, horrible. It's sad that it takes an incident like this to make us all appriciate what we've got.<br /><br />I love you all and I'm so very glad that you're all safe.</strong></font>"

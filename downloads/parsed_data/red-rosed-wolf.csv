"event","I've come to accept a realization that at times I'm an attention grabbing jerkoff who's only point in life is to complicate things. This is me at times, and at others I have fleeting moments of utter impeccable and incompetent ""good"" times. It seems like a contradictory life to lead but it somehow works together just to work out and have a final effect on everyone. Then again I could just be delusional and be thinking out of the world thoughts again. I dunno. These days it seems that I don't know nearly as much as I used to. I used to think I knew the solution to everyones problems, I used to think I'd experienced it all, and could tell you first hand how to deal with something. Then it hit me, like a kick in the nuts, I knew nothing of anything. I just spewed out a bunch of common sense that people as a whole SHOULD have thought up themselves. Once again. look at me. Attention whore. Me me me me me me me. Meh, thats how it goes I suppose. I can't really think of anything else to put in here at the moment so I'll leave it at this. adieu."

"event","Well,things still aren't the same. I tried to make up for being a jackass to her and I know she at least was happy for one day. And I guess witht that my work was done. ^_^ Hell the entire ordeal was worth it just to see her smile. But yeah, anyways. I REALLY have to learn when people are about to tell me somethin I don wanna hear. Confusing huh. Skinda like I don't wanna hear peoples rumors and all of that or what they say someone else said. Blarg, Ever have falso hope for something? Gah, surprisingly enopugh this all makes sense to me and is all connected in one way or another but it'll all prolly look like rubbish to you guys so welp MEH."

"event","Yesterday was my birthday! it was better than last year! I woke up very tired but then at school everyone said Happy Birthday and brightenend my day! At lunch Mere surprised me with the cutest bag...j/k neaklace and lip balm stuff, and cream in this awesome box. Shes the best, best friend, she didnt forget. Love you Mere! 
After i took the easiest test ever I went to practice where i didn't have to suit up and get all smelly! we just did some kicking drills and watched game tape! At home, my grandparents were here, Nana and Gram and Poppy, we had dinner and my birthday cake. Haha then when i was opening cards my dad acted like the sink broke and asked me to go get some tool from the shed. I caught on quick and ran out to find my new kyak in the creek behind our house! I wanna find someone to use it with! 
The football game was alright. I got there late :( but my friends were great, Alicia, Nicki, Jon, and Tony so I had a good time. We stayed after the game a while to talk to people.
Im gonna hang out with my girlfriends this weekend, maybe sunday and monday. Maybe ill do something with Jarrod Sunday, if he even wants to.  Tony wants to do something this afternoon, and tonight i'm goin to watch dodgeball. Right now: I want to grab my kyak and go! but- i cant go alone and no one likes to kyak... Im trying to prolong my favorite day in fall, 9/24! Happy Birthday Kel!"

"event","I am sooooo tired! This weekend was great! I met, lol or re-met Jarrod. We hung out on Friday and watched Donnie Darko.  Then we had a giant of a good time Saturday...I'm easily amused. Ohh and we watched my favorite movie! He's so sweet <3 ;)
Then on Sunday Mere and went to Hersheypark! We wore the most hilarious Hersheypark headbands ever made and we rode all the kiddie rides. The lines were so long though cause it was the last day the park was open.  I wanted to use the ""Excuse me! My kids up there!"" excuse for the coaster lines, but Mere wouldn't do it. haha Apparently 2 lbs. of chocolate= feeling in love. Damn I could've used that for all the times i was single! The most important part about the whole trip is how triumphant I felt that I drove there and back myself without getting lost...except for that one time... The ride home was the best ever- Nice lips Mere! Turn up the bass! 
Bystrom, I'm starting to understand your take on men! Bear hugs are sweet and cuddling's the best...
Wavvy hair tomorrow- Im too lazy to straighten it. When I was at Hershey i was just looking around and i started to realize some wierd Soc. stuff. ""it's not worth it!"" lol
TVFH~ im still having a bit of fun so i guess having a rebuilding season is worth it. Too bad we didn't start the reconstruction earlier. I need some tea. Ben Folds 5! night! ~KB~"

Played some indoor hockey today, won one- lost one. There were some hot guys working there, always a plus! I have to get back into ice skating- its the best. Im going tomorrow no doubt. 

Help me stay awake- I'm falling
Asleep in perfect little buildings
Beside the green apple seed
Wanna get me a little oblivion baby
Try to keep myself away- from myself

This new DSL is sweet.
hey i realized today that theres an extra week in between now and school! It cranked up my happiness a few notches! DUDE Heavyweights is on!!! I have to watch! Chat later maybe ~KB~"

"event","What are you passionate about? for me its drawing, no color just extreme detail, but i need inspiration to draw, a thing which is hard to come by these days, and doesnt last long for me. Anyway for the past couple days Ive been drawing and drawing using up my inspiration and i dont want to let it go this time!

The other day Andi and I actually went to two malls in one day- no parents and no time limits and it was great! It felt a little wierd at first being in the drivers seat next to andi of all people- but we just did whatever we felt like and listened to whatever music we wanted to. Now i just want one of the Explorers thats for sale around here. 

Im applying at Meridith Manor! Maddy said the people are great and work is a ton of fun, so i can pay for a car! Only bad thing is- its so far away. Maybe Ill meet new people though, which is always cool.

Alright I'm seriously thinking Goonies/night swim pool party with a couple people would be cool but everyone is busy working all the time now. Maybe thats a good indication that Ive been extremely lazy this summer. Inspired by good chats with *** I'm gonna research massaging and try to master it...in the kitchen maybe. 

Indoor hockey Wednesday night and hockey Thursday morning. You guys should come watch us play! (J-Menge is out the rest of the season though- terrible loss!) And I'm meeting Anita for lunch on Sat. Sounds fun- I cant wait. Once i get a car maybe some friends and i can go statewide on college visits- i HAVE to!- 

I miss camping, we used to go as a family and it was the best part of my childhood memories. But we dont have time to go anymore and i wish we'd make the time. It was great.

My parallel park was perfection and even though I almost hit an old lady in the shopping center, i still passed. Now to get a job... if anyone knows a place thats hiring- let me know! maybe ill do somethin today with Tony, if not maybe Andi and i will go shoppin! Write more later..."

"event","So now that all of my fingernails are gone again and im nervous (scratch that Im anxious) just sitting here- i should probably try to define what Im thinking so I can look back on it and laugh at myself:

I know that I can pass cause i can parallel park the huge suv forewards backwards, sideways and upside down, but i can never remember the freakin turning signal when i'm pulling out! Anyway! Once I pass I'll never have to do it again and I'll be relieved. 

Yesterday i hung out with some people i havent seen or talked to in about 4 years, and although it was cool to see them it was a little akward. No worries though! We watched The Goonies! (Best movie ever made)and played some long overdue wiffel ball. 

Silverchair (Miss You Love): Im not too sure how I'm supposed to feel or what I'm supposed to say
The point being that i cant define my emotion right now, the same emotion from this entire summer- indefinable.

Today Andi and I watched another ""Heidi"" (ha andi) movie. It was a love story about a girl with commitment problems, and i was thinking: whats wrong with this girl!? She seemed familiar- and then I realized that I do the same exact thing. I dont know why, but i have the exact opposite problem that Tony has and I think I'd rather trade him. Well the girl finds love in the end but after she goes through like 20 guys and realizes shes a idiot. ...at least she got a new set of cabinets...        My friends say Im afraid of commitment but I dont think its that, i just dont know what it is.  So here I am this lonely second to last summer in this house (writing that makes me so sad) and although I *LOVE* my down-to-earth, rightfully given title: The girl friend you can say anything to, I just wish that there was some way i could be snapped into shape, get rid of my relationship problem so I could actually be the one taking problems to some other: friend you can say anything to. Maybe I just need a friend i can say anything to, or maybe Im just rambling. Damn- i can never really define what i want to say, it never comes out right. Well i tried.

Next goal: find a guitarist to do local shows with... or learn to play myself. my voice is ready to break free.

"event","Im not ready for this 7 am wake up call! Ill be sleeping the entire ride to PSU! today was interesting- finished packing, geoff was here and i listed to their hilarious prank calling, scarfed some dinner and raced over to the Body Zone for some hockey. At 7:00 JV tied 4-4, i played at 8:00 and we beat Hamburg 7-1. on the way home we stopped to pick up PSU munchies for partyin'. Now Im at home trying to force myself asleep- its not working. 

Im starting to realize who my real friends are- and which ones just thought theyd benefit.

I just need a few minutes of friendly peace and quiet but I cant get that cause everyone wants the spotlight.

*If theres one thing I hate its people who arent genuine...Im sick of them already.* 

enough complaining damnit I'm the freaking senior and I'll do what I want to do
Off to bed- can't wait till I graduate- leave a message for me when I get back. *night*  ~KB~"

OKay so I've read about half of A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, and I swear its the worst book I've ever read in my life. Thank the God (that is everywhere in this book)that there are extremely long chapters and that I'm gonna be done soon! Okay so the guy sinned- write 2 pages and move on!!!

  
 Yay! we're staying at Findlay Commons at PSU and we do have like 2 hours of free time to chill with Mere and Mayleen.

This No sugar/ No red meat thing is actually pretty easy. I am getting sick of fish though, never thought i would,it used to be my favorite food, well it still is but i just dont like tuna anymore. Well now I'm addicted to water...strange addiction I guess, but I can think of worse!  
    I cant stop thinking about LVC and how awesome the whole experience was. Loved the campus, the poeple I met and my Prof. They have my art minor and all of my (undecided) majors, and the most awesome little cafe jaunt in the ""town"". Hershey is right there for fun stuff and jobs. I know Im supposed to be looking foreward to my senior year but I just cant wait until its over so i can go (hopefully) to LVC. Freedom at last.
 Just got off the phone with Cedar Crest College in Allentown- very nice, but i dont wanna be in Allentown AND its an all girls college, maybe that'd help me study more, no guys. I guess Ill check it out- 
To My Friends- Let me know what colleges you're lookin at please!

"event","So i finally realized Im a lazy procrastinater and I started my summer reading. So far it sucks and I think Id waste a wish on it...

YAY! well maybe... Thursday through Sunday will be bittersweet. PSU hockey camp starts and even though Im excited, Ill be a senior and stuff, my past year of hockey i didnt play goalie so Ill be the rusty one out there. but on the flip side, Mere's there taking classes and I'll get to chill with her and Mayleen who's gonna meet me there. Im also rooming with Beth, which isn't a bad thing, Ive just never been her roomate before so I hope she doesnt expect me to sing musicals before bed with her like her last roomate did...

My mood is serene on the outside and confused/overwhelmed on the inside. I have to hide it or Ill get too stressed out. school stuff, hockey, and this Voices thing Im trying to do, not to mention trying to decide where Im going to spend the next 4 years of my life...ha I'll live."

I can't put my finger on it right now but I'm not sure that I even want to at this moment.    Why is it? I just had one of the greatest weekends in forever and my mind is still spinning.   Friday was great~ couple people over for the flyers and fire- mellow explains it...Saturday was exciting, waking up to a call that says u need to work at a place that give you allergies (that was sickening-Literally), then going bowling with a different group of freinds, what id describe as harmonizing. Then at night i hopped into a softtop jeep for a ride with some great music! I had one of the best times ever meeting new cool people that I never knew existed and meeting someone that i did know exsisted!  Theres no specific word to describe it, theres a whole journal full of them, but some things are better left unsaid for now, so they will be..."

"event","Okay so we proved we can do it this past weekend- first place in the Tulpehocken Tournament- BUT we cant do it at home! We have 4 games this weekend and thankfully 3 are away! I dont know why we play better away but its annoying. Todays game was 8-4 but we stayed in it till the end, I thought it was a good game, almost tied the whole time... (I hit a double! and caught a line drive!) Anyway, we play Exeter tomorrow and it'll be good! Our overall record now is 3 wins and 4 losses. MUCH better than last year! Im so PO'd that maddy is hurt though, we NEED her out there!   
     Ben Folds Five is so freakin awesome! Hier Oeffnen! I listen and dont know whether to jump, dance, bounce or just sit and be.  

Sometimes you just feel like smiling~ even if youre not completely happy! Its usually hard to find one of those genuinely nice guys who just cant help it and after a long search maybe i have found him...maybe."

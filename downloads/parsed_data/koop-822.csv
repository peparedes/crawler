Wow, if her and K-Fed can't make it, who can?  Now, Kevin Federline is just another untalented, white trash loser.  It makes you think.

Oh yeah, and there was an election yesterday, too.

Funny story:  I went to vote yesterday and the old ladies that were getting my ballot together noticed my name and started asking questions about my widowed Grandfather, including how his health was and whether or not he has remarried.  What a bunch of whores!"

"event","I started my new job Friday.  I like it.  I still feel very inept at things and I am looking forward to when I get to the point that I'm really comfortable and now how to do everything, like I am at Sears.  I know that will come eventually.  Everyone is pretty nice though and it's cool to be working with Brent, especially when he brings his ipod an we can listen to Madonna while counting.  One of the best things, too is that the day goes by super fast.  So far though, so good.  It's kind of exciting to be doing something different.

Gretchen's flight came in early Wednesday morning.  Terri, Gretchen, and I went to Buddy's for dinner, then to the Oak, and then to Meijer, for fun.  It was fun, because Gretchen was wasted.  I can't believe we used to go there all the time.  Gretchen is supposed to be getting married next summer.  She has asked Terri and I to be bridesmaids, which is a nice surprise.  I can't believe two of my closest friends will be married by the time we're 25.  Weird.

I worked 8:30 to 5:00 at the Museum on Friday and 6:30 to 9:45 at Sears on Friday.  It was a long day, but not unbearable.  After that I went to Gretchen's and had a margarita.  It was fun.  It was too bad the other girls didn't come.

Tomorrow is the start of a busy week.  I work at the museum tomorrow until 5, then Gretchen and I are headed to Terri's for a sleepover.  I'm excited, it should be fun."

"event","Dinner with the girls = super fun.  We went out to Terri's again and went to Memphis Smoke in Royal Oak, which I personally thought was a little overrated, but still a good time.  We all had a good time and everyone got along.  Hopefully, I will be able to hang out with Gretchen a few more times before she leaves.  She said her and Jesse will probably be getting married next summer, here. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but as long as she's happy, I guess that's all that matters.  Yeah, I'm trying this optimism thing.  We'll see how long it lasts.  V-I will call soon."

I was a making a Michigan left to get to Sears, and this guy in a mini-van totally cut me off.  We both get stopped at a red light and he's in front of me and the light turned green, the douche bag turns and an F-150 hit him.  It was cool, and it made me happy.  Is that weird?"

"event","So last night Tyler, Shannon, and I decided to go see Saw 2.  Now I know the first question that comes to everyone's mind is ""Is Cary Elwes in the sequel?""  And sadly, I must admit that he is not.  Shannon said his voice was in it, but really that could have an impostor.  Donnie Walhberg from NKOTB (Thats' New Kids On The Block for those who are not enlightened) so that was good, but I don't know if it's good enough.  I did not see the first Saw (And according to Shannon, I missed out) so I can't accurately compare performances, so I can only comment on this sequel.  I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.  Ever.  It was excessively gory, to a point where it was just gratuitous, not even scary.  And without giving too much away, it totally left the ending open for a sequel.  I fucking hate when movies to that.  It's so stupid.  So, if you don't happen to see Saw 2, you're not really missing anything.  I still had fun last night, though.

Which brings to me to the conclusion of the evening.  Well, I guess it's better to fully explain the whole story now.  Tyler and I went to pick Shannon up to go to the movies.  Shannon comes out with a bottle of lotion, because she got a ring stuck on her finger.  So, she was trying to lube up her hand, in hopes of sliding the ring off.  Well, Shannon had no such luck, so we were trying to think of other options.  I suggested soaking her hand in cold water, because the water would make it prune, and the cold would reduce the swelling.  Because, by this point her finger was swelling from the pulling.  Tyler and I each tried pulling the ring off her finger, with no luck.  So Shannon is sitting in the theater, with her finger in a cup of ice water.  This is doing no good, nothing is getting this ring off.  We were leaving the theater after the movie, and Shannon still has this ring stuck on her hand.  So she was like, the fire department can cut it off, right?  I wasn't really sure, but Chuck was working last night, so I called Ruth and told her what was going on, and she called Chuck and told him we were coming up to the Fire Department.

Chuck is waiting for us at the front door with the ring cutter, thinking it will take him two seconds to get the ring off.  I probably should have explained, that this ring was the biggest, thickest fucking ring ever.  The ring cutter barely scratched the surface of the ring.  So, Chuck tells us to come inside the Fire Department and promptly called two guys over to help him.  The cute guy started lubing up Shannon's hand with surgical lubricant.  They also used KY, too.  And every time my Dad said KY, Tyler would start laughing.  Still, nothing would get this ring off.  So then, they decided to saw it off with a dremel tool.  But first, the other fireman had to run home and get it.  My Dad then brought some huge ass saw out, that I think freaked Shannon out.  So, they finally but a popsicle stick in between her finger and the ring and started sawing.  He got it down really far, and then just used pliers to snap it.  It was very entertaining.

So today, Shannon and I went shopping for our Halloween Costumes.  And let me tell you , they are fan-fucking-tastic. We are going as Dorothy Zbornak and Sophia Petrillo, of the Golden Girls.  Now, I don't want to reveal too much about our costumes, but I will say this:  finding a grey wing was nearly impossible, as it is, we are kinda improvising, but I'll explain more later, I must go get ready.  Scaryoke tonight bitches!"

"event","Tonight I went to the movies with Tyler and Brent.  We saw Glick in LaLawood.  It was pretty funny, but very weird.  It was really short, but I guess if that movie was any longer, it wouldn't have been as funny.  The Jiminy Glick Show on Comedy Central was always funny, but often times that kind of stuff doesn't translate well into a movie.  This was on the fence.  We also missed the beginning of the movie, so I don't know if we missed anything vital.

Two highlights of the evening:  Singing my song.  (We don't need another hero by Tina Turner)  Tyler wearing two different shoes.

We really need to do Karaoke this summer, because we have been practicing our signature songs.  Tyler needs to make me a copy of Tyler FM, so I can practice.

"event","Last night was pretty funny.  We went out for Shannon's Birthday.  But, before that Brent and I had to get her a gift.  We went to Target, but couldn't find anything, then Brent picks up a vase and goes, ""What if we get her this and put a Beta Fish in there?""  I must say it wasn't the greatest idea, but it was something.  We bought the vase, then we bought a case of water.  Why a case, you ask?  Well, I found a single bottle of Evian but Brent said that for that money could a buy a whole case of Target brand water.  So we did.  It was only like, four bucks (for the Target Water).  So we go across the Street to Meijer to buy a Beta fish.  I wanted to buy Shannon a hamster, because those are cool and they only cost like ten bucks,  but Brent said that they require too much attention.  I am buying somebody a damn hamster for their birthday!  Anyway, we found a fish and named it Bea, for Bea Arthur, of course.  Then we bought pink plastic rocks, which are awesome.  I wanted to get a wizard to put in the bottom of the vase, but it was really too big and I didn't want to scare Bea.  So, then we pay for Bea, but first the guy tells us that there is a ten day warranty on the fish, so if the fish dies in that time, we have to bring back our receipt ant the fish carcass.  (he didn't really say carcass, he said body, but I think carcass is funnier.)  So then Brent and I head out to the parking lot to put Bea in her bowl.  We looked like weirdos standing in the Meijer parking lot putting Bea in her bowl.  We should have waited until we got to Applebee's to put Bea in the Bowl because then Brent had to drive us to the restaurant while I was holding an open fish bowl.  Than I asked Brent if Meijer fish warranty would cover Bea if she died in an automobile accident.  But we got Bea safely to the restaurant.  Then Shannon had to deal with her.

Shannon's card was awesome.  I picked it out, it had an Amish guy on it and when you opened it, it said on the inside ""Amish You."", which makes no sense, but whatever.

We went to Applebees's, which was fun, than we went bowling.  Bowling was pretty fun accept that we went in Allen Park, which sucks.  I hate seeing people I know.  And Tyler requested 2 Michael Jackson songs.

And I was right, I'm sick.  I hope Bea didn't catch it.

"event","Yesterday was hilarious!  I went to the new Meijer's with Brent and Tyler.  We went at midnight because the Golden Girls Season One DVD Came out today!  I didn't buy it because I didn't have enough money, and I am not the biggest Golden Girls fan.  I went because I knew it would be funny.  I have to say, though, I am not that impressed with the new Meijer.  It looks just like the old K-Mart did.

Anyway, there were a lot of people in the DVD department last night.  Some were there for Harry Potter, some were there for Seinfeld, and some losers were there for U2.  I like U2 and everything, but they are not that great, and one of the ladies that was there waiting for U2 was mean.  She was making fun of Brent and Tyler for getting Golden Girls.  I mean, she would not shut the hell up about it.  And the Seinfeld people were Psycho!  This one woman was swearing and everything after the manager told her they didn't have it.

Then, Tyler asked the manager if they had Golden Girls, which they didn't, so he had them call the Southgate Store, and they did, so we went there.  The best part is when the manager asked Tyler if he had a thing for Bea Arthur.  And when Tyler kept dancing and getting marks on the floor.

oh, and the thing made to stretch shoes is majorly underrated. it is the best thing ever. everyone (ok, maybe just girls) should invest in one. 
and the robot devil from futurama rules too.

<lj-cut text=""maybe""> I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said 
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love and we all got hurt 
I sneak into his car's black leather seat 
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat 
Boy, we're going way too fast 
It's all too sweet to last 

It's alright
And I put myself in his hands
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
Love, or something ignites in my veins 
And I pray it never fades in white houses<lj-cut>"

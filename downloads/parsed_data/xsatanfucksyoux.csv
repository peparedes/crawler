Sometimes I can think the most jealous thoughts.
theres nothing to be jealous bout.


all i can say is im the happiest person alive when im with him
nobody has ever made me feel as good about life/myself as he does


Im putting my heart in his hands and 
hes treating it like its the most precious fragile thing in the world


I have never felt this way about anybody.. 
nobody has ever treated me so right!!


I will post pictures later.

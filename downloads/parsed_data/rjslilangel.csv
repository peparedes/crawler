"event","Did you ever notice how fast time seems to go?  I looked at the date today and still can't believe it's almost Christmas.  It feels like it was Christmas just yesterday.  I'm pretty much done with my shopping, although I need to get something for my boyfriend.  He won't give me any ideas either.  He just tells me not to worry about it.....all he wants for Christmas is me!  I find that so cute but I still want to give him more.  I wish I could give him the world.  But I have to save that for my son.  

I'm still dealing with my mom accusing me of stealing over $5000 worth of her jewelry.  I had to stop over there to drop something off tonight.  I walk in the door and she starts in on me.  Good thing Ryan was there or she might have said something in front of my son.  She just needs to realize that I would NEVER do anything so stupid, even if I do need the money.  I have other, legal, ways to get money.

I got my hair cut today.  I ended up taking almost 5 inches off in the back.  It was so damaged.  I think I will be taking pics.....after I get it colored.  Right now, the color is really nasty.  I LOVE the new but though.  It is so cute and versatile.....plus Ryan thinks it's sexy!  That's always a plus."

"event","Today has turned out to be the worst day ever.  First, my mom accused me of stealing over $5000 worth of her jewelry.  I had nothing to do with it but she sent the police over to my house anyway.  I talked to the officer and he seemed to believe me.  I have no idea where this is going to go but it is majorly upsetting.  Then, I found out my dad has a herniated disk in his back.  He can barely walk and he refuses surgery right now.  He has 2 weeks of physically therapy and then they will determine if surgery is the only way to go.  I hate seeing him in so much pain.  And finally, my son was hysterical when I left him this morning.  He cried and was almost hyperventilating again.  *sighs*  This is so not my day today!"

"event","I am suddenly having horrible writer's block.  LOL.  It happens a lot with me, however, I had a ton of ideas not more than an hour ago when I was in the bath.  Ugh.  Next time that happens, I think I better get out and write them down immediately instead of waiting.  It actually happens a lot with me.  I'll think of something while I'm lying in bed and then, bam, I forget when I wake up.  Shame on me for not writing them down.  LOL"

"event","First thing that happened.....a girl I knew for the last three years has taken upon herself to declare a war against me.  She has posted some pretty nasty things about me.  They are as follows.....

I love how easily I get to you. If you stayed on your side of the States you wouldn't be getting ""annoyed  and drained"". Mind your business, stay away from my profile and you wouldn't be bothered by me would you? But that's how nosy bitches are; they can't seem to stay to themselves cause they want to make themselves look ""CRAZY"" by posting blogs about shit on private profiles. So right there I do know you. I know you are so pathetic you would never be able to pubicily post something I'd see because you are afraid of what I would do to you.

So let me clarify.

YOU ARE A WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE. YOU ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MOTHERS EVERYWHERE. YOU ARE A THE MOST PATHETIC PERSON I'VE EVER SPOKEN WITH.

 

BUT........... with that being said, know this. Since I know you can't resist looking at my profile I will continue to stress you out.

And no, I'm not unhappy, getting rid of you was the best thing I could've ever done. No more stress, no more headaches, no more ""Oh my man left me"" crying pathetic phone calls. Did you ever wonder why he left you? Here's an idea: Who the hell wants to be with someone like you? I couldn't stand talking to you on the phone without wanting to stab my ears out. I spent many conversations staring vacantly at the ceiling with the phone on the floor so I didn't have to listen to you babble about pointless bullshit like you always did and still do.

But one thing I've always said about you is that I love how brave you are on the internet. Not one of these things would you say to my face cause you'd know what would happen. Oh and before you get all psychotic and ""She threatened me!"" like you always do when someone says something like that about you... It's not a threat. It's the truth.

So here's to you!

1. Grow up.

2. Take care of your child and stop letting your parents raise him. A good mother that does not make.

3. Get off the pills. You know damn well you go get pills for any reason at all. Like the time you told me you had to get what was it? Percs or Vicodin cause you had your teeth filled or some shit like that? That's pathetic.

4. Please make sure that if you have a boyfriend right now he's old enough to be your man.  (By the way, you piss me off, which you havent come close to yet, and I will scream that story from the mountains.)

5. Be very careful about who you trust as a friend dear, because some people you obviously don't know as well as you thought you did. Hence my getting all my info.

 

Love ya!

Okay.....here's the next post from her.....

 	

One more thing chick!
Current mood: happy

These are the reasons I haven't called you:

 

1. Your phone gets cut so much cause you can't afford to pay it only Christ knows what your number will be next.

 

2. I don't talk to pathetic, pathological lying whores. I surround myself with real people.

 

3. If you made up that shit, which I know you didn't you're just trying to cover your ass now, then you're the only psycho here.

 

4. If you are as crazy as you swear you are GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER. I'LL MAKE YOU CRY LIKE NO ONE HAS MADE YOU CRY BEFORE. 

With that being said.......She pushed me too far this time.  Whatever!  I'm done.  She can do whatever she wants.  It doesn't bother me anymore than it has in the past.

The other thing that has prompted me to change a lot of my online habits is that I found out who has been feeding information to her.  It was a so called friend of mine that I thought understood what I was going through.  I told her in confidence what was going on and she turned around and told.  Oh well, I'm too old for any more drama.  Move along is all I can say."

"event","It's going to take me awhile to figure out what theme I want.  I can't afford to pay for LJ right now so I don't have access to all themes.  I am not that good with HTML and CSS yet at this point so until I learn, I'm just going to keep it basic.  So far, I like what I have here.  Now, to find some friends.  LMAO!"

"event","I decided after some problems to just make a new LJ.  I think this one is prettier than my other one anyways.  I have no friends on here right now but I am hoping that will change.  I just need a place to vent out my frustrations and to talk about how I am feeling.  Plus, I can give my thoughts on books, movies, and music."

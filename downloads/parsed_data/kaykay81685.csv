Which means, you definitely dont want an update from me right now. From now on, I will say that I am going to update hmm maybe once a month, k. Thats all I really have time for right now. So bye for now."

"event","So, Sam and I decided that now would be a good time for me to update...haha! Sorry that I haven't written in a month.  Things have been a little crazy with work, school, and just everything! I dont know where to start.

School is going good for the most part, with the exception of one class. Having a teacher that likes to offend the class every week is not so good. My other classes are good, just a lot of work for each. So, if I haven't talked to you in awhile, it's nothing personal...just yell at me and I will take some time to talk to you for a few. I've just been very busy...the school work is just neverending. One day it will be all worth it, right? That's what I'll keep telling myself. I applied for the Early Childhood Education program today, hopefully I get in. If I dont get into it, then I guess I will just have to get my BA in Psych and my masters in Teaching. It would be a lot easier to get certified before graduation though so I could get a job as soon as I graduate. So, please pray and cross your fingers that I get in.

As for work, it has been much better. We have a new boss, Josh, and he's awesome. The staff has been getting along much better also. It finally feels like a team and it makes the job more fun. We have had some good times this semester! haha... On the other hand, I have had to deal with a few incidents already, including writing up the girls in my suite. So, that didnt go over so well and they have obviously been mad about it for a few weeks. That's my job though, I've gotta do what I'm supposed to. I have decided that next year I am definitely going to be an RA for freshmen, that should be an interesting year... I can't wait.

This semester has been much better than last semester, as a whole. I've definitely grown this semester. I've learned to let go of things that I needed to let go of and I've learned that I can be happy on my own. I had a hard time dealing with not having Travis around and I almost hurt our relationship because I was too needy of him. Luckily, through some time apart, I found out that I don't need to depend on him so much and that I can handle things on my own. I'm very glad that I finally took the time away to realize this because now our relationship is much stronger. You are my soul mate hun and I dont know what I would do if I ever lost you. Thank you for sticking around so long, especially after all we've been through. I dont regret it though because it has taught us a lot. Of course, I wish things could be different... but I guess we learned the hard way. Things will work out the way they're supposed to... hopefully they will work out for the better. For now, I am just glad to have you in my life still and that's what is most important. I can move on now and find someone that will make me happy too, knowing that I always have you to count on. I will always love you hun! (Watch out for those lemons! hehe.)

So what else is up? Let's see... Mr.Sparkles (my betta fishy) died, he basically buried himself under the plant in his tank and killed himself. So, now I have another new fishy, her name is Bailey... she's very cute. We also have 3 fish in the RA office now too... Josh named them Delicious, Tasty, and Scrumptious...arent those just great names? haha! What makes it better is that we put a sign up that says ""Do not eat""... I guess its funnier if you were here. lol. On a sad note, my parents came to visit me this weekend and told me that Princess, my hamster, died.... so that kinda ruined the weekend. She was my baby... so I miss her. Other than that, the weekend with the 'rents was good, it was a nice break from school and everything. I'm going to go home next weekend I've decided. I know, I never go home... so it's a shock, but I've decided that I need a few days away and of course I miss everyone! So, I'm looking forward to that.

Valentine's day was okay this year. I have not had good experiences with it in the past, but yesterday was very busy so I didnt have time to stop and think about all of those experiences from the past. My ex-boyfriend tried to kill himself a few years ago on Valentine's day, so that kinda ruined the day from then on forward for me. I actually had a dream about him today when I was taking a nap, which was very weird because we have not talked in almost a year. Hopefully everything is alright with him...I definitely miss him. However, I got some valentines, some cookies, some chocolate, a flower, and a blanket... so overall, it was good this year.

Okay... last of all... more guy stuff.  So, now I have two guys that have been hitting on me, that I don't really like like that. I dont know what to do about it though, I've been trying to just be nice and deal with it. However, I feel horrible not telling them that I don't like them like that, but at the same time I dont want to tell them. I dont know what to do about it anymore. I will hang out with them and stuff to try to be nice, but then I feel like I'm making them think I'm interested even though I'm really not. Its hard cause they're really nice and sweet and everything, just not my type. (Dont worry... if you're reading this, then its not you! lol) And on the other hand, there is a guy that I kind of like but I have mixed feelings about it because of a certain issue. We wont go into the issue, but basically I'm just confused about how I feel about it and what I should do. So this is something I have to try to figure out. 

Anyway... enough for tonight! Its time for bed! Lack of sleep has been common for me lately... so it will be nice to sleep in a little bit tomorrow. Hope everyone has a good week... Happy Belated Valentine's Day.. or as Sam would say, Happy Single's Awareness day. haha! thats great hun! Goodnight...sweet dreams!"

"event","Made it back to school before all of the snow decided to dump on me... haha. Well, I'm back at school early for a week of training for work... not fun. I love snow... haha. I like being back but I dont like the idea of 8am-7pm training and work every day... yucky. 

Thank you to everyone who made my christmas break better than I thought it was going to be. It got off to a rough start, but it got much better thanks to all of you. I'm gonna miss you guys so much this semester... Kayzers, you better come visit me once your leg heals and you can drive up here. 

Hopefully this will be a good semester with work and school... that would be great. I dont like my schedule right now, but hopefully I'll get used to it. I thought I was gonna get away with not having any night classes, but I was wrong. I only have one night class though, which is good compared to last semester. The one good thing is that I still have fridays free... yay! 

Time for some sleep now... I dont know if I can get to sleep so early, but I have to wake up early so I need sleep. So goodnight everyone! Love and miss everyone! mwah!

"event","Well... figured I'd better update now if I plan on sticking with my plan to keep my journal updated this time around.  

Things are getting better I think.  I've been spending a lot of time with a certain few people (haha) and have managed to keep my mind off of everything most of the time by keeping busy. I've been taking care of karina a lot lately because of her having her knee operated on.  Now I kinda dont wanna go back to school because its always nice to be home when everything is going wrong, thats where you can always find comfort. So, I'm gonna miss that. 

I'm gonna make this a short one and I'll try to update again tomorrow. I'm very tired, so Goodnight!"

"event","Turns out that this was the first year in a while that I spent New Year's Eve at home.  I did go to Kayzer's house til about 11 or so to keep her company and that was good... but I'm so used to being out celebrating New Year's Eve with friends and stuff, so it wasn't really as fun sitting here watchin the ball drop with the 'rents.  

And how bad is it that the person who made me smile on Christmas day ended up making me cry tonight.  How can someone make you so happy and yet cause you so much pain too?  

Oh well... on that note, I'm just going to bed for now.  Hopefully this new year gets better, that would be really nice. Goodnight and Happy New Year everyone. 

Happy Birthday Kimmie!"

"event","This is for someone who said that I disappeared from livejournal world and needed to start my journal back up, seeing that I stopped updating for at least two years or so... ooops, sorry. So, as a new year's resolution I am going to try my best to keep this updated for those of you who seem to care I guess...haha. If I don't update enough, just yell at me to do it and I will. 

Anyway, Christmas wasn't really that great.  First of all, I almost got in a car accident on Christmas eve because of a drunk driver and was shaken up by it all weekend.  Then, I watched my fishy ""angel"" die when I was getting ready to go to sleep christmas morning... so I didn't sleep very well. Let's just say I wasn't in a very good mood on christmas, so I felt bad cause it brought down everyone else too.  One person did make me smile though and I really needed that, so thank you hun.

Yesterday, my uncle got rushed to the hospital because he had a very serious heart attack.  He had another one today too I guess, so he's not doing very well.  My grandfather on the other side of my family also had to go to the hospital because he had a heart attack.  The bad thing is that I haven't talked to my grandfather in years because of some family problems...and it's scary to think that something could happen to him without our family ever reconciling.  This holiday season just isn't going good.

As for that ""thing"" that I planned on doing soon... umm, I've decided that with everything going on right now I really can't do that.  I don't know if I'm making a mistake or not, but as of right now I don't think it would help.  Maybe I will be able to do it later, maybe I wont.... only time will tell.  Thank you to those of you who helped me realize that I need to do it, please don't be upset that I'm not actually doing it.  It's nothing against any of you, and if things just get worse then I only have myself to blame.  I blame myself for dealing with it up until now and I'm used to dealing with it on my own because everyone gets frustrated with me... I'm sorry, but I hope you understand.  I dont need you to agree with my decisions, I just need you there to help me through all of this.  

Okay, well... not a very happy start to a new journal, but you asked for it.. so here it is.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone!

"event","<p>-sigh- I guess I'll pass this on. It's kinda fun...<br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Um... Kuja tagged this to me... "">List ten people you know of or know personally, and then tag three people at the end of the meme to do it as well.<br />1. Yuffie<br />2. Kuja<br />3.&nbsp;Seifer (wherever the hell that bastard is)<br />4. Olette<br />5. Namine (At least I think that was her name... the girl who was helping clean TT earlier)<br />6. Irvine<br />7. Demyx<br />8. Fuu<br />9. Pence<br />10. Zexion<br /><br />Answer these questions in relation to the people listed above.<br /><br /><b>Say #9 decided to move in with you. Is that cool?</b><br />-shrugs- It wouldn't be weird. He's my best friend after all.<br /><b>Would #7 ever make out with #10?</b><br />--laughs- From what I could pick up in that Castle, they've already done that <strike>and maybe more...</strike><br /><b>What if a psychic told you that you were destined to marry #7?</b><br />I have a feeling I'd be beaten up. Pretty badly.<br /><b>Does #3 have a girlfriend or boyfriend?</b><br />-insane laughter- HE WISHES<br /><b>Do you have a crush on #1?</b><br />... Um, I hardly know the girl, other than the fact that she saved my ass in the castle.<br /><strong>If #6 told you he/she loved you, what would you say to them?</strong><br />...... <br /><b>What would you do if #4 morphed into a small lizard?</b><br />That'd be pretty weird. Poor girl.<br /><b>What is #5's favorite sport?</b><br />Cleaning?<br /><b>Have you ever heard #8's singing?</b><br />I've hardly heard the girl talk, for that matter.<br /><b>Does #7 ever get off the goddamn computer?</b><br /><font size=""2"">How the hell should I know?</font><br /><b>Name an inside joke you have with #4.</b><br />We've got too many to count -grin-<br /><b>Do you think #5 and #6 would make a cute couple?</b><br />Wow....<br /><b>Does #1 get out enough?</b><br />I DON'T KNOW (shiva, this stupid thing is making me realize how I don't have ANY friends....)<br /><b>What is something #2 says too much?</b><br />-twitch- He calls me ""his little boy"". Let's not dwell on that.<br /><b>How did you meet #4? What was your first impression?</b><br />Oh shiva... I can't even remember...<br /><b>Is #8 gay?</b><br />No clue, and neither would I want to know.<br /><strong>If you give #9 sugar or caffeine, should you duck and run for cover?</strong><br />-hysterical laughter- He gets pretty paranoid, especially off caffeine. Oh man, that one time we tried to stay up for 48 hours... damn...<br /><b>Have you ever seen #3 sleeping?</b><br />... what kind of question is this? <strike>If I did, I'd make sure to draw on his face or something of the likes. Hehehe....</strike><br /><b>Does #7 like pictures?</b><br />From what I've seen of him, I guess so. That thought never really passed through my mind...<br /><b>Is #2 more the adventurous type, or the laid-back type?</b><br />Um... he's neither. He's just hyper. All the time. <strike>And strange... not that I mind! If he can read this, don't feel bad! Gah... screw this....</strike><br /><b>Can #1 cook anything well?</b><br />-shrugs- If she can, then she shoulda cooked up some grub back in the castle thing.<br /><b>Describe #10 in one word.</b> <br />....... (That is my answer)<br /></div><p><br /><br />Tagging Pence, Zexion, and Yuffie. I guess because I can.<br /><br /><font size=""1"">((ooc yes I know there's no Seifer and maybe Hayner doesn't know these people all that well, but the guy's got no friends! Show him some love!))</font><br /><br /></p>"

"event","-quirks an eyebrow- Well then. What's goin' on here?&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm just minding my own business while helping the old man clear up the back alley of TT, when this redish, orangish... <em>thing</em> pops outta no where and jumps on me. It started whispering all this weird stuff into my ear... some odd language of sorts, then it hopped off and I saw the red furball bound over towards where Pence and Olette were hanging out, yelling that message all the way. Maybe they caught it or heard it or something. I dunno.... I just wonder what the hell it was saying. It wasn't like anything I've ever heard, that's for sure.<br /><br /><strike>On the other hand... that fuzzball was pretty cute, weird language or not... -coughs-</strike>"

The two had to leave me alone today of all days.

"event","-arrogant smile- Well! The (tall, blond, and devilishly handsome) hero, namely me, wins again!<br /><br />Pence is found and acounted for, as the hero knew all along.&nbsp; The dork was all the way at the other side of town so me 'n' Olette practically died (... what? Okay, <em>slight</em> exageration) looking for him, only to find he'd been on the <em>other side of town. </em>Man! <br /><br />So Pence, if you find this, get your butt over to the Station! 'Else I'll hunt you down amongst all the rubble and debris that used to be out peacful town!<br />... Damn, I know I wanted to say something... um... Oh! Right! Aparently there are people coming to help, quote ""rebuild Twilight Town and rid it of the evil forces, also known as the Heartless"" unquote. This should be interesting, to say the least. A bunch of forigners trying to rebuild our town? Who do they think they are? They're acting almost as arrogant as Seifer's gang. <strike>The only cool thing is I heard that they might be Reapers! And I thought those were only myths! How COOL!</strike><br /><br />And then there was that blond kid. I swear I've seen him somewhere! Damnit! I just hate it when you've got something on the tip of your tounge but you don't know if it's right! Arg!"

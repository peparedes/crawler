(tho we really shouldnt have done it becuz u know...its toxic!) anyways...we walked a couple miles to meet up with becky later in the day. yeah...it was tiring...but it was a perfect day to go walking! then dans friends all came over to kayleas house and i stalked them....I AM A STALKER! I AM A STALKER! lol...well...then i went home @ 10...and my cat got out...so i was outside trying to find her...that took a whole lotta time becuz...she loves being outside...so she was hiding...i finally got her in around 11. i was sooo fricken tired...so i went to bed. Thennn today i woke up at 8, cuz my brother came in my room and woke me up. He asked wen and where i was going today, and im just..'idk..im trying to get some f*ckin sleep' and i really dont think he liked that too much. but i did end up gettin up in about a half hour, i took a shower...and while i was in the shower, i realized im a total clutz, cuz the thingy that holds all out shit up in the shower (shampoo, razors, soap etc.) fell down, then i hit my head on my shower radio, that feel down, and the battery thing came undone, so here i am, in the shower, water pouring down, trying to get the damn batteries back into my shower radio. and beleive me, its not the easiest thing in the world. then after blow drying my hair and stuff, im walking outta the bathroom, and being my careless self, i didnt put my blowdryer away...so i trip on the cord while walking outta the bathroom and the first hting my brother says is 'what the hell are u doing trying to knock the whole damn house down, my god' im like...'just shut ur mouth, god dammit' and yes take note, we use the word 'damn' an awful lot in the saxton household...anyways..i gotta go cuz kayleas party is tonight...BOOYAH!!! hehe...we gunna b total pyros tonight..thats a surefire thing..."

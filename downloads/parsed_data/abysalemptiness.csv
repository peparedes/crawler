"event","I'm going to start posting again because well... I'm depressed again.  earlier, i laid awake for hours earlier in the dark of my room pondering ways that i could legitimately kill myself.  ways that i could end this ""perceived"" suffering without my family being too upset, without my friends being affected.  i came up with a few ideas, but i eventually started crying and gave up.  i took a shower because a few years ago a girl named Marcy reminded me that sometimes when we hate ourselves so much we simply need a ""cleansing shower"".  it helped a little.  i hated myself less and went downstairs and hung out with my roommates and jimmy and Emily.  i hate that those two are together still; all i can imagine is that he uses her all the time and she gets nothing in return.  all i want is to make a girl happy and want me in her life.  simple mutual affection and enjoyment.  that's all i want, is to feel wanted by someone i want.  its not a selfish conquest or some status thing, i just want to have that bond with a girl.  but i can't.  i can't have anything i want.  this is why i want to die.  i honestly don't see the point in progressing towards... nothing.  which is all i have the ambition for now.  i have become so bitter towards the world and the people in it that i simply want nothing more to do with it.  i do NOT want your pity or false statements of understanding, because it's simply not that simple.  the few people that understand me really don't.  this isn't a cry for help or anything, i could make it private.  i just don't want this in some separate realm from my other posts, because it's all heartfelt.  i wanna say what i have to say without needless worry from others, because anyone who actually has the power to change my mind about this won't.  all the rest are merely people i care about that can't change my mind.  forget the drama, forget the formalities.  this isn't about that.  i just want people to know how i feel.  i want to vent, that's all this is for, so fuck everyone.  i have been kind for too long.  things have changed, and then again they haven't.  so where to go from here?  let's see...  i have no potential in baseball, no desire to form a band and go through any of the same b/s again, no inspiration to draw, and no other reasons to pursue anything else I'm good at.  money's always been tight, and I'm tired of being a burden to my parents financially.  what does someone who has no aspirations anymore do?  i wait to die.  that's where I'm at.  i have forgotten the love of god and the bible, because frankly Christianity has become a joke before my eyes.  hypocrites and liars alike, why would the obvious tendencies of humans to lie and manipulate be excluded from the histories of religion?  we can't even document the truest events accurately.  i hate this existence, i wish for so much more.  i feel our purpose has been tainted by the agendas of awful people.  and now i hate myself for being alive during all of this.  i hate my wasted potential.  i can not bring myself to try anymore, even though i will.  after all i can't let my parents see how far I've fallen.  but if what i say is true, it won't matter anyway.  so fuck off world, i hope we get what we deserve.  i know i have(n't).  but we'll get it whether we like it or not"

You have to set yourself on fire

God that was strange to see you again
Introduced by a friend of a friend
Smiled and said ""yes I think we've met before""
In that instant it started to pour

Captured a taxi despite all the rain
We drove in silence across Pont Champlain
And all of that time you thought I was sad
I was trying to remember your name

This scar is a fleck on my porcelain skin
You tried to reach deep but you couldn't get in
And now you're outside me you see all the beauty
Repent all your sin

It's nothing but time and a face that you'll lose
I chose to feel it and you couldn't choose
I'll write you a postcard, I'll send you the news
From the house down the road, from real love

Live through this and you won't look back
Live through this and you won't look back
Live through this and you won't look back

There's one thing I have to say so I'll be brave
You were what I wanted, I gave what I gave
I'm not sorry I met you
I'm not sorry it's over
I'm not sorry there's nothing to save
I'm not sorry there's nothing to save"

"event","this has been the hardest thing i've ever done.  forgetting the person i thought i'd be with forever.  when shes still within reach.  i can try to communicate with her still... its crazy!  so many things remind me of her.  i cant get her out of my head.  i've spent the last couple weeks distracting myself from the thought of amanda.  will has been a big help for me... hes gone through a similar situation and he never acts too busy to listen to me vent about her.  its ridiculous.  so many things are happening in my life and still...she remains at the forefront of my thoughts.

  part of me wishes that she'd read this, or something to remind her of me, and that she'd contact me again.  but realistically its not going to happen.  its weird imagining how someone can move on from you.  and vice versa.

is this the hardest thing i've ever done?

my mind is so shot right now.  i'm not healthy enough for anything mentally.  or anyone.  i'm sure this is all for a reason.

i just wish i knew my reason."

Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin

"event","so i think it's time i started putting down my feelings again.  i've been losing track of how i really feel lately.  i think its because i've been around so many fake people my whole life, i've become fake myself to get by.  

it's crazy.  AOL...AIM...screen names.  facebooks, myspace.  people show how they feel through those.  it's easier to block somebody than to resolve why you don't like them.  or its just not even worth resolving.  that in itself shows how they felt about you from the get-go.  

in a world where i've felt so paranoid about how good a person i am compared to others, these are some of the things that actually get to me.  someone can mess up in so many other ways in person around me, say fucked up shit to my face, etc... but once they block my screen name i know its for real.  hah... it makes me wonder what kind of person i really am to people.  if they view me as some creep that needs a restraining order.  

i hate myself."

"event","tonight my grandmother died.  it hasn't fully hit me yet, because i happened to be drunk when i got the news.  she was such a beautiful part of my life, someone who always brightened my life up no matter what.  i can't find words to express the magnitude of this loss.  she was so important to me.  i loved her with all of my heart.

she's been in the hospital for months, an infection spread and caused other infections.  then she couldnt breathe on her own.  i will never forget the last time i saw her.

i walked in, she was heavily drugged.  she wouldnt wake up for my aunts and uncles who held her hands and kept calling her name to wake up.  they let me hold her hand, and she gripped it instantly.  after 10 minutes or so of holding her hand and her not waking up at anyone's request, she woke up randomly and looked right at me.  she smiled and motioned at me to kiss her.  i leaned in, and gave her a kiss and she kissed me back.  through all the years growing up, i never kissed her back.  at christmas time she'd always ask me for a kiss and i'd always been like ""hah hah"" and let her kiss me.  i never returned it.  this time however, i kissed her and she looked at me and smiled so brightly.  then she passed out again at random, still holding my hand.  that was the last time i saw her, a month ago.

i was scared to see her again, in such pain.  i didnt wanna change my last memory of her, cuz we all knew she was going to go.  then my dad called me tonight with the news.  i don't know what to think.

this year has been so hard.  i've had 3 friends die, and others leave me for personal reasons.  but none has hit me so hard as this.  i'm going to miss you so much Nama."

they see right through me
There's no need for inspection, 
there are no surprises here

There was a time 
When I thought 
we saw eye to eye
But assumption led me to letdown
(I was cast aside)

To you i'm like a problem
with a formula you already know
As long as you fill in the blanks right
I'm not so hard to handle

I wish there was something i could see within myself
something even you could not look through
something that means too much to ignore
that you just couldn't discard

Something that throws you off,
that you can't put your finger on

Something you can't put in a jar
or under a microscope
(That won't fit into your formula)

i'm afraid to face myself, how can i face you?
i'm running in circles
my fear has gotten the best of me
i can't hide it

insecurities dragging me down
taking me to that wretched place
hanging by my heart
tortured by your eyes

all i can see 
are your eyes seeing through me

Your eyes, they follow me to my dreams
I can't see past them
Yet they seldom look at me
never to see what they aren't missing

I've yet to experience a winter chill 
quite as cold as your eyes
Or a summer day as hot 
when they burn right through me 

Your eyes, 
they see right through me
No need for inspection,
there's no surprises here"

i live with damien, will, and justin henagan at damiens old house off of albright.  it's really sweet.  i'm out of my house for the first time in my entire life.  

my parents don't think i can manage paying rent and saving money, because i never saved any at home when i lived there for free.  i feel that me not having to pay for anything gave me an excuse not to save, so i ended up taking advantage of them.  so for me to learn to be truly responsible, i need to get out of there and see what it's like.  and thats what i did.  this was the perfect opportunity for me to grow up more than i can at home being babied by my parents."

"event","...and there I am in Shri Lanka, formerly Sirlon, at 3 o'clock in the morning looking for 1,000 brown M&M's to fill a brandy glass, or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.  So, Jeff Beck pops his head 'round the door, and mentions there's a little sweet shop on the edge of town.  

    So, we go - and it's closed.  So there's me, and Keith Moon, and David Crosby breakin' into this little sweet shop, right?  Well, instead of a guard dog, they've got this bloody great big bengal tiger.  Well, I managed to take out the tiger with a can of mace.  

    But the shop owner and his son, that's a different story all together...  I had to beat them to death with their own shoes...  

    Nasty business really, but sure enough, I got the M&M's, and Ozzy went on stage - and did a great show."

"event","The incisions in your wrist were all for show. Just like you. 
The epitome of self indulgence. 
Another farce. A charade and another set of crocodile tears. 
So serenade her with your last pathetic suicide love song. 
""Broken hearts never mend"". But fools never move on. 
And now she's gone because of you. 
And once again you're the epitome of pure self destruction. 
Cupid never found his mark. As we wait for the insertion of blades on flesh. 
You part the skin & tell of blades on blood. 
So part the fucking skin. To tell of blades on blood. 
She said, ""I love you"". she said. she said ""goodbye"" 
So cry me a fucking river, bitch. 
You wouldn't know love if it crushed your fucking chest. 
Let Go. 
You wouldn't know love if it crushed your fucking chest. 
""Razors, Roses and A Black Tomorrow"". 
They never showed any affection to anything but your ego. 
A tragedy of errors at the best of times. 
You are everything that's wrong with me. 
You are everything that I despise. 
You are everything I dreamed would die. 
You are everything that fades away & slowly dies. 
Will you bleed for me when suicide seems so yesterday? 
Will you bleed for me? 
Will you fucking bleed for me when suicide... it's so yesterday. 
It's all so yesterday."

"event","so here i have come again.  to this dumb little online thingy.  to confess my feelings in private to the public.  

am i ever really happy?  this is stupid.

got my ups and downs.  wish i had some consistent feeling in either direction.  i just have this consistent lack of feeling content with shit right now.  

i worked 2 days at the shipyard instead of advance auto this week.  coincidentally the only two days it rained and had 30-40 mph winds.  lovely.  i got paid 17 dollars an hour though to go through a variety of physically demanding and stressful situations.  did like 20 hours of that stuff in two days, so my paycheck should be nice, after they rape the taxes out of it.  see...ups and downs in everything. 

tonight i practiced some more on my new 7 string guitar.  oh yeah, i bought a 7 string guitar.  got it off ebay for $325.  its a Schecter c7+ that they don't make anymore...i think it's like 5 years old.  it's been modified with a vintage tremolo and gotoh tuners and some strap locks.  everything else is normal...its a charcoal sunburst style finish...its quite lovely.  pretty much the only thing i can play on it is unearth, but i can't wait to start messing with my own songs with it.  i can play all my other songs on it but the bigger neck makes my fingers go to the wrong spots a lot, especially on chords.  

been thinking about death a bit lately.  seems like a good alternative to uncertainty.  i'm not saying this like i'm suicidal.  i'm just thinking about death itself.  the concept.  i doubt i'd kill myself.  unless there was a dog running around with an outfit of swords the were pointing straight up.  then i'd run up and belly flop to my death on the poor doggy.  what are the odds of that though?"

Looking at my hands, I saw blood
I look up, and see you staring back at me
You were always there, waiting for me to see you

Feeling like I had abandoned you, I cried
I became angry, I felt abandoned
Carving your face in the floor, I spat on you
Later that night, I fell through your glass ceiling

Dressed in glass, I fell into your arms
You caught me, and I swam in my blood
When your bullet left my skull, the sky turned orange
I left your arms, and dug my way to Hell

You always watched me, especially at night
I would watch the moon, its light incubated my sadness
You always called to me, and I walked even further to drown you out
But tonight, I heard you for what you're worth

I'm tired of failing, tired of searching,
And most of all, I'm tired of being remembered and forgotten all at once
I'm tired of trying, tired of living
So tired that never waking up is the only way I'll find an end to this bullshit"

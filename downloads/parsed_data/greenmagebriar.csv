<lj-cut text=""Link drop yays"">
<i>Briar!  Good morning!

It's ... a little after midnight.  What are you talking about?

I couldn't sleep.

Why should I suffer?

Because Tris and Daja have gone out of range.</i>  

Briar felt Sandry pout and sighed.  <i>What do you want to hear about?

Anything.  

All right.  Met a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/587809.html?thread=33703969"">demon</a> who apparently doesn't kill people anymore or something like that.

Oh, and I may have gotten volunteered into doing <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/593844.html?thread=34435764"">radio</a> again.

...

Sandry?

I don't even know where to begin.</i>

Briar chuckled.

<i>We also <a href=""http://thenamesxander.livejournal.com/839.html?thread=4935"">moved</a> in to <a href=""http://thenamesxander.livejournal.com/839.html?thread=1095"">cabins.</a>

Did your classes start yet?

Yup.  I had <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/874764.html#comments"">First Aid</a>, <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/876958.html?thread=41741470"">Astronomy</a>, and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/878818.html?thread=41862882"">Nature Magic</a>.

Sounds interesting.

It is.

Had a bit of <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/610057.html?thread=36333833"">insomnia</a> a few days ago.

Feeling better now?

Yes.

Is that a hint that you want to sleep.

Yes.</i>

Sandry sighed.

<i>Talk with you later then</i>

<lj-cut text=""You're ignoring me!"">
<i>You're ignoring me!

Am not!

Are too!

Am not!

I haven't heard from you in six days!

I'm learning my way around!

So what did you learn?</i> 

Briar could almost feel Sandry smiling truimphly and groaned.

<i>A bit of <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/581097.html?thread=32386281"">new slang.</a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/570036.html?thread=30860724"">Televisions are weird.</a>  As are <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/581097.html?thread=32428265"">movie</a> plots.

What?

It's usually best just not to ask.

So what else.

Girls around here really like it when guys are <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/574389.html?thread=31436213"">wearing</a> shirts.  And someone passed a new rule requiring everyone to have a nametag.

That's everywhere.  The girl's liking guys without shirts part.

There is no one here who uses the same <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/581097.html?thread=32392425"">map</a> as us and it makes for some odd conversations.  And I think I accidentally broke a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/577020.html?thread=31821564"">girl's</a> brain.

At least it wasn't her heart.</i>   

Briar mentally stuck his tongue out at her.

<i>So this is probably a bad time to mention how I may trying to <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/577020.html?thread=31825404"">convince</a> the girls to go topless next Friday?</i>

Sandry mentally thwapped him.

<i>Ow!

Apparently this school has <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/577020.html?thread=31832316"">gremlins</a> and other <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/584615.html?thread=32895399"">random monsters.</a>

...What?

That was my general reaction.

And in closing news, I found Tris's long lost <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/584615.html?thread=32918951"">twin</a>.

What?!  

I don't have a twin!</i>  

Tris chimmed in.

<i>I meant she reminds me of you, copper-curls.  

Her hair was setting of sparks?

Ha.

I try.

Can I sleep now?

You still promised to tell me about clothes!

Girls pretty much only wear breeches.</i>  

Briar smirked and mentally closed himself off.  Within minutes he was asleep.

<lj-cut text=""In which Briar talks to the voices in his head.""</lj-cut>
<i>Briar!</i>  Briar pressed the pillow down more.

<i>Sandry.  I haven't seen you in an entire two days.</i>

<i>I miss you.  Discipline is just too quite.  How have you been?  What have you been up to in the past few days?</i>

Briar groaned.

<i>Met my <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/870530.html?thread=40823938"">roommate</a> who also happens to be a plant mage.  I probably should have realized that most students here are on drugs when the first girl I met claimed to be a pretend <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/870530.html?thread=40792962"">princess</a>.  Erm, <a href=""http://greenmagebriar.livejournal.com/1237.html#comments"">talked</a> to my roommate some more.  That was all yesterday.</i>

<i>You didn't do anything today?  Why do I have trouble believing that?</i>

<i>There was a party in one of the common rooms where the other students were worshipping something called the TV.  I don't get it either so don't make me explain!  There were <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/565992.html?thread=30131944#t30131944"">people</a>.  People who made me wonder if everyone here is insane.  There was a guy with a box that recorded everything and a guy who was just plain weird.  The girls were pretty and sane though.</i>

There were three snorts in his head.

<i>How soon will you be out of range?</i>

<i>Never!</i>

<i>Niko thinks two weeks or so.  Maybe a month if we try really hard.</i>

<i>Same here.  What?  So sick of us already thief-boy?</i>

Briar chose not to reply and ignored the laughter of his foster-sisters.

<i>All right, I'll leave you alone!  But you are telling me what people are wearing tomorrow!  I want to see if there are new fashions there!</i>

<i>Yes, Sandry.  Whatever you say Sandry.  May I sleep now Sandry?</i>

He was answered by blessed silence.

""I hope no one wanted milk today."" *crash* ""Or was too fond of that plate.""

""I told you to begin packing last week Briar!""

The boy in question sighed and tossed a few more shirts into an open travel bag by the foot of his bed.

""She did tell you to start packing a week ago.""  Sandry pointed out from the door way.  Briar glared and tossed in another shirt.

""I know they don't wrinkle but if you fold everything neatly it'll take up less room.""  Without waiting for an answer, Sandry began re-packing Briar's bags.  

""Sandry?  They're pretty much limitless.  I could put Little Bear in there an-"" Briar was interrupted by a loud knocking on the front door.

""Niko?  Is something wrong?""

""No, actually.""  Niko raised his voice a notch.  ""Briar?  Rosethorn?  Can I have a word please?""

Briar scowled at Sandry and headed to meet Niko.  ""I have to finish packing.""  He informed the older man.

""Sandry is doing a lovely job of it for you.""  Niko replied with a small laugh.  ""Actually, you won't be traveling with Rosethorn.""

""What?""

""You'll be going to Fandom High instead.""

Briar snorted.  ""Right.  So half-a-year, I come home, and then I can go with Rosethorn?""

""..Yes.""  Niko replied slowly.  ""You'll leave tomorrow with the girls.""

""Niko?""  Tris's voice echoed from upstairs.  ""Niko I can't find my atlas!""

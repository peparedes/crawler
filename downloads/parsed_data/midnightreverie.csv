So he's very awkward around girls, but he seems fine with someone like Midori.    <br />    <br />- At first I couldn't believe he was rejected in a marriage interview (omiai)... because he's quite handsome in the manga.    <br />    <br />- Saki is missing from the manga. A lot of things have been sacrificed for an earlier appearance of SPR/Naru. I wonder whether she will ever appear in the manga?    <br />    <br />- Agawa house: 'a little problem' is quite a heavy understatement.</lj-cut>   <br />   <br />"

"event","<P>I tried to translate the first chapter of <STRONG>Murder in the Decagon</STRONG>, but unfortunately it equaled to having my brain bleached. I'm still reading it and I suppose I'll get back to&nbsp;translating one day, but not very... soon.

In other news, I got my hands on the <STRONG>Akumu no Sumu Ie</STRONG> novels (Ghost Hunt sequel)&nbsp;by Fuyumi Ono. I've read some snippets of the book on&nbsp;another lj, but nobody else seems to have attempted a full translation. I've translated the prologue and it's easy as pie compared to what her husband wrote. I still need to have it checked on accuracy and fix the somewhat garbled English. 

<lj-cut text=""Manga/Novel comparison"">It should be interesting to compare it to the ongoing manga, because so far there are certainly quite a few differences. Namely, the exclusion of one character, Nakai Saki. Some other things have been left out too in favour of SPR's appearance.</lj-cut>

Also, I'm not sure what to watch from the fall anime line up, though I'm pretty sure <EM><STRONG>Psycho-Pass</STRONG></EM> is&nbsp;in the list. I mean, <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_A_wsT5WQE"">look at the trailer</A>. Female newbie cop, handsome young men&nbsp;in their late twenties, badass old guy&nbsp;and spiffy guns. Yesss. If the characters can work out a good group chemistry it would be perfect. If I can't get any UDDUP, I'll take this.

Story: <EM>In the world of Psycho-Pass, there exists a measurement device called the Psycho-Pass, that allows emotions, desires within humans to be recorded and managed by the authorities in order to determine and control the parameter of crime rates, which allow the authorities to have better judgement on crimes and bring criminals to justice. Since the existence of Psycho-Pass, a group of officers has been established by the Public Bureau Criminal Investigation Department Ministry of Welfare, in order to perform their police duties to maintain the peace of society.

Oh man I was 18 back then? I think it was a half year after I dropped out of HS. I didn't remember doing this, so this came as a nice surprise. Some hopes and aspirations in the mail were not fulfilled or only half of it, but I still think I've come far compared to what I thought I would be.

"event","Ack, that episode was so damn&nbsp;<EM>cute</EM>! I've been replaying the last couple of minutes, because it was just too adorable and so (unintentionally) romantic. XD&nbsp;...and DAT music!

With that Jin pretty much cemented himself&nbsp;as one of&nbsp;my most favorite characters.

I also love how the very unexpected pairing has two 'seemingly unimportant side-characters' (I can't even remember them being in the first episode), who turn out to be pretty important. I think I can&nbsp;sort of relate to both characters&nbsp;very well and their relationship. Just hope they'll get a good ending, but I'm not counting on that... :( They're too cute for a tragedy...!

"event","<P>I haven't done one of these in a while, a rec post! Lately I've been reading some&nbsp;webtoons and I particularly&nbsp;enjoy this one. It's a supernatural/horror/mystery series.

<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001ctrrs""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001ctrrs/s320x240"" width=320 height=172></A>
Think of it as a Ghost Hunt/Natsume Yuujinchou/Yakumo mash-up&nbsp;with a Korean setting. There's no snarky genius character, but&nbsp;SID has supernatural powers, ghosts, and the chemistry between the characters is very comparable to that of Ghost Hunt. Three of the four main characters are&nbsp;in their late&nbsp;twenties&nbsp;and there is one teenager, which is refreshing&nbsp;for this kind of&nbsp;premise. The main characters are from very different backgrounds. It ranges from a prematurely gray ghost-seeing detective, an&nbsp;sword-wielding&nbsp;redhead foreigner, a shaman kid with parental issues and&nbsp;a mysterious profiler. Of course that doesn't mesh, and that's where most of the fun comes from. :D

<lj-cut text=""Story+ Characters + pretty pics"">
<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cs6k4""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cs6k4/s320x240"" width=320 height=209></A>&nbsp;<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d16ra""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d16ra/s320x240"" width=320 height=200></A>
<STRONG>Si Mun
</STRONG>.................*v*
Okay, he actually looks more like on the right image&nbsp;in the webtoon, because I've picked these images from the author's weblog.
Anyway the main character is sort of an adult Natsume who can suddenly see <STRIKE>youkai</STRIKE> ghosts due to inheritance from his famous grandmother. He was able to see ghosts as a young boy, but his grandmother hated her life as a shaman and&nbsp;made her grandson forget about the ghosts and suppressed his ability to see them. Many years later Si Mun ends up as a fairly ordinary police detective&nbsp;known for his&nbsp;premature gray hair.
The story begins when his grandmother's influence diminishes and he starts to see ghosts in broad daylight.
<STRIKE>He is also Pikachu.
</STRIKE>
<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cy904""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cy904/s320x240"" width=320 height=199></A>&nbsp;<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d0wez""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d0wez/s320x240"" width=161 height=240></A>
<STRONG>Tenka</STRONG>
On that day Si Mun bumps into a strange and questionable&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;individual whose Korean is terrible and they constantly bicker. He's crazy and&nbsp;just hilarious. xD Si Mun manages to solve the first supernatural case with the help of Tenka.

<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cwxd4""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cwxd4/s320x240"" width=163 height=240></A>&nbsp;<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d2dec""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001d2dec/s320x240"" width=270 height=240></A>
<STRONG>Baram
</STRONG>Right after the first case the duo comes across this kid who is several times more mature than the guy above. He claims to be a shaman like his dad. At first he thinks that the two 'old geezers' are unqualified to meddle with the supernatural.

<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001czydw""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001czydw/s320x240"" width=267 height=240></A>&nbsp;<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cx9af""><IMG border=0 alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/midnightreverie/pic/001cx9af/s320x240"" width=169 height=240></A>
<STRONG>Sophia
</STRONG>Not soon after a foreign&nbsp;'profiler' arrives to&nbsp;the police department, and&nbsp;Si Mun&nbsp;thinks she's similar to his grandmother. To solve a&nbsp;serial murder&nbsp;case she's taken in to create a secret task force, and Sophia wants him to join her.
She's so friendly it's almost unsettling. o_O; but I really like her!</lj-cut>

Originally it is a weekly all-color webcomic on the Korean site Naver and it's now up to 80-something chapters. However, there are only 34 translated chapters out, which can be read&nbsp;on <A href=""http://webtoonlive.com/description/Supernatural+Investigation+Department/"">Webtoon live</A> and <A href=""http://web.rawcrossing.com/?s=Supernatural%20Investigation%20Department&c=000"">Rawcrossing</A>.

"event","Let's not try to make this too awkward. T-T I'm just very bored and I suppose updating this journal would make it less boring! My twitter is barely updated so it means more time for longer messages.

I'm back and other than hibernation tendencies, life does not seem to be kicking me. In the meanwhile I have moved to a place cheaper and closer to the faculty. It's a shabby place, but good enough.

Currently watching Another, Natsume, Thermae Romae and Aquarion EVOL. Recently finished Un-Go, some j-dramas (BOSS, Ryusei no kizuna, Yasashii Jikan, etc) and Sherlock. Otherwise not much else. I intend to marathon Gankutsuou (and Mushishi) whenever I'm finished with re-watching Noein. 

Anyway, <STRONG>who's still reading this?</STRONG> I'm honestly curious how many people who have friended me are still around. o_O I do not blame you if you don't remember who I am... Something tells me I need to do a friending meme.

<lj-cut text=""She dragged the blind guy into an alleyway and said..."">In the middle of this is Haruka Touyama, a 12 year old girl, and the main character; she&#39;s a precog for about 90%, she can see many possible outcomes (relating to herself and people important to her). Someone finds out about her ability, the result is that she gets kidnapped by yakuza, who want to use her to win lotteries and gambling. Before this happens Haruka uses her ability to escape and find the best person to help her out of this mess: a blind man.

<em>&quot;.....
That&#39;s a very grown up thing to say.&quot;</em>

Despite the ridiculous condition, a lot of ass kicking happens, courtesy of this Mamoru Hijikata who utilises a sword which can cut through anything. He&#39;s GAR, ruthless, intelligent&nbsp;and therefore the manga&#39;s major selling point... attracting fanboys and fangirls like a magnet (..including myself orz). As for why he can see outlines; it&#39;s all in the glasses provided by his partner in crime, Igawa, and their team is called Blade.&nbsp;Their roles are...

Igawa&#39;s responsible for the transportation and technical things and is one of the most <em>sane</em> ones around. Also watches like a <strike>hawk</strike> big brother over Haruka.&nbsp;He&#39;s my personal favorite. *o*

Beside team Blade there is the Wall, from the Elements Network... an international organization&nbsp;which supports these kind of things. The Wall has 26 members, who are phonetically codenamed. Two of them are the leader Alpha and the other Sierra.

The detective, who knows a little more about Mamoru&#39;s dark background&nbsp;than anyone else. An incredibly moody one too. :D Genda gets involved with the various plunderings and&nbsp;Haruka&#39;s case and&nbsp;is obviously making a&nbsp;link to Mamoru.

The cast is quite extensive, and most are secondary or side characters, so I singled out the most important ones so far.

<strong>My impressions:</strong>
Although UDDUP runs in a seinen magazine targeting young men, it really has a crossover appeal; under the nearly non-existent fandom, even shoujo fans like it a lot. It has mostly to do with Mamoru being incredibly hot/intelligent/GAR/tsundere&nbsp;and Haruka being there to relate to. Also for the interesting reveal in a certain chapter.

With the exception of Haruka, the whole cast is adult, which gives an established feel... with lots of room to explore the various&nbsp;backgroundstories. At the same time it will be interesting to see Haruka&#39;s development as she grows up surrounded by&nbsp;a bunch of emotionally&nbsp;messed up people, but are in fact new family to her. They&#39;re all likeable, I can&#39;t think of any annoying characters.

<em>A not so ordinary relationship...</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>The story is unfolding nicely in my opinion... it&#39;s all action in the beginning, but from what I&#39;ve seen so far it does take time to flesh out the characters, relationships&nbsp;and the plot.

The art is insanely good - it&#39;s great in the beginning already, but it gets even more beautiful, but doesn&#39;t overbeautify.&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t shy away from getting gory or ugly either. The body proportions&nbsp;actually&nbsp;look good.&nbsp;Everything looks like it&nbsp;could have existed in real life.&nbsp;It&#39;s not amateurish, that&#39;s fore sure. Very attractive art.

In short: This is a manga well worth looking into, the concept of a blind swordsman isn&#39;t exactly the most original thing ever (Zatoichi, ahem), but the story was well enough to try following it raw. The art is great and very detailed.&nbsp;In other words it&#39;s begging for an anime adaption, although I think it&#39;s a little early for one...

It&#39;s a fast read, so at least try the first two volumes, which equals 16 chapters. :D (....there is a reason for this... read and you&#39;ll understand)

"event","Hey LJ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it has been a long time since I last posted an entry, so I shall just type whatever I can remember. 

Went for SYF. Cool huh? Haven't learnt our results. 

So many things have happened I don't know what to say. 

When to new SGH building. Nice. 

When swimming with Saklani and friends. 

Dunno what else to say. Still loving Ugly Betty.

"event","Hey LJ,
Today I learned that I have an entirely different skill. Photography. The pictures I took were great and I am burning them into a CD so I can bring them home. Here is a few.&nbsp;
Sorry I don't have time I have to interview an idiot. I will come back soon. Bye!"

"event","Hey guys,&nbsp; 
I haven't updated for a long time but currently I am at Republic Polytechnic as a student reporter for the Youth Avenue camp. Secretly using com now so will quickly update. I will post pics and update later to caption it.&nbsp; 

Currently in conference room where a blackout has taken over everything. We are all working in the dark, watching Youtube and blasting music in between posting blogs on the company website for people to read. Today was the poo, I (like a newfound friend) plucked up courage to ask the company's chairperson a question in one of those ridiculously scary Q&amp;A sessions. And this was in front of JC, Poly and ITE students.&nbsp;

I was shaking so hard my left leg gave way and I almost fell except I was hanging on for dear life to the seat behind me.&nbsp;

Then we went around to do this and that, interviewing MPs and apparent high level ""VIPs"". Then we played games in the ""rain"" where we played with fire literally. But the bathing time was the most interesting.&nbsp;

The bathing facilities were freaking clean for a Singaporean school. It was like I was in a modernized Eton school where all the tiles were marble white and no dirt or bacteria existed. It was gigantic and like a maze. The whole campus is empty so we almost got lost when we were going to bath at the Sports Stadium.&nbsp;
 And now back to the Conference room where everyone is slacking and not only doing work but also wandering off to Youtube or Radio Blog Club to refresh our mind. I love camps where you are considered special so you can stay up using up to date laptops to do the ""work"" assigned to us.&nbsp;

Well, back tomorrow after slacking. BB"

"event","School is weirder than ever. 
Correction, I am weirder than ever. The timetable has changed twice in a fortnight. 
Both times everyone was badly hit by the sudden change of test deadlines. Especially CA work. 
I joined ELDDS and went for my first debate at Monfort Secondary School. Their campus is just renovated thus better than any I have seen. Air-conditioning in all permanent classrooms? Isn't that expensive? Fees must be sky high. 

Anyway, my seniors lost their debate. It was preliminary rounds. Shameful for the previous runner-up. 
At least they still have two chances left. 

Random, Scarlet Johanson and Ashley Tisdale have debuted albums. Ashley's songs have a ""Radio Disney Edit"" version for young kids loyal to their resident snob from High School Musical. 

Just finished homework. Signing off with a few songs to recommend. 

*Edited twenty seconds later*
After viewing the blog I realized I can't hold songs from RADIO.BLOG.CLUB
So, Tata"

"event","&nbsp;I honestly do not know why some people go cuckoo. 
Today, the time-table was changed and we weren't informed. When I didn't bring the class to Science lab for our practical, Mrs Chan scolded the class and cancelled lab sessions for the following weeks. 
Half the class now blames me since Common Tests are in 2 weeks. And we only have one lab session each week now. 

The one thing I have noticed is that only the childish ones can't seem to shut up. 
Proves the others know that I'm not to blame. 

Another piece of good news is that the school's resident stud has been canned for pushing me down. He was supposed to get four strokes of the cane but the principal took pity since he was just Secondary One and canned him only two strokes. I almost screamed in anger. He very well knew what he was doing and deserves neither mercy nor sympathy. 

If that wasn't bad enough, a girl in my class was pulled out for councilling since my friends told the principal she was slashing her own wrist. I knew she was mentally unstable since her parents almost disowned her, but slashing??!! I was afraid of her since she recently threated Jing Ann while holding a penknife. Everyone was speechless and couldn't move, only watching her move slowly towards Jing Ann, penknife looming scarily in her hand. 

Well, enough tragedies so,
Tata..."

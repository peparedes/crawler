<b>10:00 pm</b> Just finished last bits of homework. Have found am getting faster at it, probably due to taking classes before. Have decided both Arthimacy and Ancient Runes professors are favourite. Hate Slughorn. Nasty fattish fellow with a long mustache. His breath smells like sardines, and he laughes too much. Why must we have him for Potions?? I want Miss Burke back. And I find Headmaster Dumbledore does not make Defense Against the Dark Arts very amusing. Where&#8217;s the beautiful German man? 

<strike>I miss Brian Bullas the most. I swore we had something there. I knew there was a connection. I always wondered what he looked like in a wet shirt, much like Mr. Darcy in <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i> Damn him for getting himself killed. Bugging hell. Why have I been thinking about him all night?</strike>

<b>11:33 pm</b> Was just re-reading late night conversation with Slytherin Severus Snape. 

<lj-cut text=""The conversation"">
[What she read]
<i><b>S. Snape:</b> ....It's weird, though, no-one seems to want to talk about it.

<b>B. Jones:</b> I want to talk about it. I think...well, I think the truth is people are scared, Severus. I hear students whispering to each other in the library and common room. We know (Ravenclaw) about the letters you lot got last year. We already connected them to the emblem in the sky after that qudditch game. And then there was the manfesto...and murders. Every suspicious murder this summer had the same emblem hanging in the sky, appearing long after the death.

I...know...this because it was over our apartment building the night daddy died.

<b>S. Snape:</b>Okay, I didn't mean be that open about it... But okay. I see what you're saying. I'm a little curious as to how you Ravenclaws know about the letters, because even though I know a few of 'us' might've said something about them in the journals, I don't remember doing so... About people being scared? You're not fucking kidding. I can feel it. Not sure what all of this means right now, and I don't know that I really like any of it.

I didn't read the manifesto all the way through... is that bad? I mean, all I really know is that this person keeps going on and on about power, and if he's got the same emblem appearing in conjuction with each murder, it's only natural to assume he's behind all of it. He knows things he shouldn't, and I... And I don't know that I really feel comfortable talking about it over the journals, to be honest. Too easy to break the charms on them for an experienced wizard like this person seems to be, if you ask me.
 
Ehm.... were you really close to your dad or something?

<b>B. Jones:</b> No offense or anything, but you are quite closed minded about Ravenclaws, aren't you? There are many many friendships between us and Slytherin, probably moreso than Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. I have seen more Slytherin/Ravenclaw interhouse dating couples...more so in the past few years, then with any other houses. And not only Slytherins got the letters, you know. There's more going on than what you seem to see.

But of course, no one ever listenes to me. Silly little Bridget. She's just a silly failing student, who knows nothing unless it was coated in chocolate or wanted to kiss her.

I have been hurt enough, especially in the last term and summer to be more aware of things. There is something out there. Something very evil, and it has no ...ethics or morals to speak of. In fact, its not even human. 

And now there were reports of werewolf attacks....and giants...

Yes, I was very close to my Dad. My mum had just left him, you see. Going through a sort of midlife crisis and took off with a man from the Home Shopping Network. He had white teeth, sunkissed blonde hair, and a very orange tan. She rung a couple of times over the summer holiday from her vacation with him in the islands. She said daddy didn't pay enough attention to her, and that..that she was jealous of his love for me. 

And daddy was heart broken when she ran. She just calmly packed her bag and told him what a nasty man he was, and how selfish he was (he wasnt! Far from it!) And its not like my mum is very likeable! Okay, that was horrid of me. But she was always pushing me to meet and date these random men, like so and so who was a barrister in London, and so and so who was a book publisher. Its like she was pushing me to become whatever she never was, and when Daddy and I didn't want to follow along she up and left.

And then, this summer, he was...I swaer it..murdered. I haven't heard from..mum since. Not really. A postcard, one phone call. And that was in July.

I'm practically an orphan, really. And silly me is still in school 
when I'm far older than anyone else. I lost everything that night...my father, my mother, my cat, my sense of self, really.</i>

<b>Where:</b> Muggle London on a rainy day
<b>When:</b> Saturday August 6, 1976

<lj-cut text=""Hey! There is absolutely nothing scary about the combination of me, a room, and a bed. Nothing at all."">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  A mid afternoon storm that contained hail made Bridget's awkward driving nearly disasterous as she made her way down the street Sirius Black had given her. She had the station wagon's windshield wipers running full speed, with the heat on full blast. She had the left blinker on when she meant to turn right, and she was fearful she was driving with the emergency brake on (which she wasn't.) The radio station blared a toothpaste jingle, followed by a weather report calling for a high of 76 and clear skies all around. ""Not bloody likely!"" Bridget yelled at the radio as she passed the apartment building for the third time.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius loved hail. In fact, he loved weather of all sorts, and the more violent the better. Up in his apartment, he had his nose and palms pressed against the window to watch the ice hitting the street, the sidewalks, the rare, pained-looking passerby. Especially mesmerizing was the sound it made hitting the metal hoods of passing cars. He could hear it even from five floors up. But...wait. That car looked familiar. In fact, he was sure it had already passed several times. The boy pushed the window open and stuck his head out, yelping as a few pieces of hail smacked into him. He waved at the passing car, suspecting that he knew its occupant.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget was going out of her mind now. She was SURE she passed the same lightpost now, and she stopped the car in the middle of the two lane street, lights on highbeam and the windshield wipers going. She stared ahaead at the tall building, and then screamed in delight as another car pulled away. She made a grand attempt at parrallel parking, and then stumbled out of the car (kicking an old french fry box away). Slamming the door shut she threw her arms up in a victory move, and then realized someone was calling out. She looked up, hands still up in the air, and squinted through rain up to the fifth floor. ""I was just..parking!"" She calls out, feeling quite stupid now.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius was laughing hard enough that his words were hard to hear over the rain- ""Right! Congradulations! I'll be right down,"" he added, withdrawing his head and slamming the window shut. A few moments later he clattered out the front door of the building and crossed the street to Bridget, his arms flung wide to welcome the rain. ""Found it, I see,"" he commented drily to the girl.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget stared at him, wondering for a split second if he was going to hug her, fall over, or do a song and dance in the rain. Or maybe he was stretching. She hugged her arms around herself and wondered why she didn't wear a raincoat. ""Yes!"" She said loudly. ""I did, sorry. I'm not good with directions really.""

<SavageFlight>  Sirius tipped his head back and opened his mouth to admit the rain; unfortunately, the sky chose that moment to send another spurt of hail down upon them and he got hit soundly in the forehead. ""Shit!"" he yelped, darting for the car and pawing at the door. ""Let me iiiiin,"" he said, pouting at Bridget. ""The sky is cruel. How lost DID you get, anyway,"" he added, eyeing Bridget.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Give me a second!"" She yelps as she funbled for the car key among the ten keys on the brightly coloured keychain. She scraped the key into the lock and it clicked. She then slapped his hand away and yanked the door handle for him to open the door. ""Don't mind the mess!"" She called as she ran around the front to get into the driver's side.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius practically leapt into the car, slammed the door shut, and twisted in the seat to look around. ""You think this is a mess? You ought to see my bedroom,"" he quipped, raising an eyebrow at the girl. ""Thanks for this, Jones.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She stared at him, as her wet hair drapped down at the sides of her head. She slowly grinned and turned to start the engine. ""Scary,"" she mumbles, in respond to his bedroom comment. She started the engine, and the heat blasted as well as the radio blaring the music of Bob Dylan came on all at the sametime.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius turned a mock-hurt look on the girl. ""Hey! There is absolutely nothing scary about the combination of me, a room, and a bed. Nothing at all.&#160;You wound me.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget's eyes went wide as she was starting to pull out of the parking spot. Her reaction was followed by her slamming on the breaks, making those without seatbelts fall foreward.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Oof,"" Sirius gasped, falling into the dashboard. He turned to look at Bridget with raised eyebrows. ""What the hell was that?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She stared at him, eyes wide with both hands gripping the fuzzy covered steering wheel. ""Did you put your seatbelt on?"" She then made a face. ""You alright? I saw..I thought I saw a deer. In the street.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius stared at her for a minute, then opened his door. ""Get out,"" he said, laughter in his voice. ""Switch. I'm driving.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Are you licensed??"" She says as she fumbles for the door handle. She attempts to get out and gets partially strangled by her seat belt.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""No,"" Sirius said, coming around the car and tugging at Bridget's seat belt, ""But I don't hallucinate woodland creatures, either.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""I swear I saw a shadow, and-"" She tries to get her belt off, and does so. She stands up, her body knocking into his.""pardon...""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Of a deer,"" Sirius deadpanned, sliding into the seat and grinning widely as his hands settled on the wheel. ""In the middle of London. On Maberly Crescent. I'll drive."" He leaned across to push open the passenger seat door for her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Are you sure you can do this?"" She says as she moves around the front of the station wagon. She then settles into the passenger seat and watches him in a pained stare as he settled into his driving seat. ""I mean, this isn't a motor bike you know.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius smiled at the girl. ""I'll figure it out,"" he promised. ""I figured out Olivia all by myself, didn't I? I'm a big boy."" He laughed and studied the gear shift for a moment before turning the key.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""No! That's neutral!"" She yells, hand flying out for his on the gear shift.""Put it in drive!""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius complied, laughing. ""Calm down,"" he said, grinning at the girl again. ""I'm not going to kill us. Look, there's not even anyone else out driving right now. We'll be fine.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget made a wide fake grin and let out a small ""okay."" She then gripped the side handle of the door very tightly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius looked at the hand gripping the door and shook his head. ""No sense of adventure, Jones,"" he admonished, glancing around and pulling out of the parking spot.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Always..wanted one..."" She says, voice trailing off as she slowly reached her other hand over to change radio stations. ""Music choice, Sirius?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Lady's choice,"" Sirius said, taking one hand off the wheel to tuck a wisp of wet hair behind his ear.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget fought off the urge to yell ""BOTH HANDS!"" just as her own mother had done to her when she applied lipstick and drove at the sametime. ""Where are we going?' She said instead, trying not to sound panicked.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius laughed again, enjoying this. ""It's not very far, just up here,"" he said, pointing with his free hand. ""Muggle shop. Even Prongs- ah, James- was disgusted by my current clothing filing system, so I figured I'd purchase some drawers. Can't transport them on Olivia, though, can I?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She slowly mouthed the word ""prongs?"" to herself as she looked out the side window at the empty street. She looked back at him and made another semi-forced grin. ""I guess not."" She then looked into the back seat, to access the amount of room. ""Think we may have to toss some stuff..like that baby seat and bicycle.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Was that your baby seat?"" Sirius asked, glancing at the girl as he jerkily pulled into a parking spot.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Was..long ago. Don't know why mum keeps it still."" As she said and then felt herself lean over against him as he turned sharply to park.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Obviously, she misses your innocent childhood self,"" Sirius said with a smirk, looking down at the girl against him and raising his eyebrows yet again. ""Well, hello there, Bridget.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She moved her chin up, and caught herself staring at him. Because of how she was leaning against him and his expression, she blushed. ""Pervert,"" she whispered and drew herself back to hold her own against the door handle. She couldn't help but make a grin. ""I am still innocent, at least. Are you going to put the emergency brake up?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""I'm not the one cuddling up, now am I?"" Sirius asked, returning the grin. He glanced around, looking just a bit confused. ""Emergency brake. Right."" after a moment, he spotted something he thought might be the brake in question and pointed at it, giving Bridget a questioning look.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She nodded, and then put her hand up. ""Put it in park first Sirius! Geez!"" She was afraid he would surly break something in her mother's car. And then she added ""I wasn't cuddling up.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  He complied, laughing again. ""Don't you trust me yet, Jones? And of course you weren't. That was just wishful thinking."" He winked and got out of the car.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Her jaw dropped to form an ""O"" and she stared at him after he got out. The nerve of him, was what she was thinking, but more so how embarassed she was..because he was so ever casual about everything. Flushing, she yanked the ancient seat belt off and pushed the heavy station wagon door open. Letting it lock behind her, she moved to him as he stood on the sidewalk. ""Is this the place, then? Unfinished furniture!? Why do you want it unfinished? is it missing a leg?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius glanced over his shoulder. His expression was extremely amused.&#160;""Means it isn't...painted, or varnished, or whatever it is they do to furniture. Means it's cheaper. Uncle Alphard left me a nice sum, yes, and I'd like keep waste it on firewhiskey rather than furniture.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Well that was nice of him,"" she tells him as she follows him to the store front. ""Can we paint it then? Perhaps a nice hue of orange.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius blinked. ""We could,"" he agreed slowly, ""But maybe red and gold? I've got to represent Gryffindor properly."" As he walked into the store, the Muggle proprietor, a stooped and aging man in a polka-dotted tie, waved at him from behind the cash register.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""What's wrong with blue and silver? Maybe day-glow green? it is the seventies after-all! Not 1950."" She remarks as she follows him in. She eyed the store keep with raised eyebrows and nodded with a mumbled ""hullo.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""I'm not a Ravenclaw, to the first,"" he said, totally disregarding the fact that this would sound mighty odd to the Muggle if he heard it, ""And...well. Day-glo. There's an idea. Any idea where we could get day-glo paint?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Perhaps a hobby shop, or we ask the man over there,"" she said, pointing at the shop keep. ""Do you even know what sort of dresser or table you want?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius gave Bridget a confused look. ""Why the hell would I know that? It's just a dresser, innit? How many types can there be?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Well how big do you think?"" She adds, as she leaned over to look at a random dresser. ""Did you measure?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius messed nervously with his hair. ""Not exactly..."" he admitted, inspecting the dresser. ""I know how big the room is, I can just sort of...eye it up."" He glanced around and pointed at a random dresser. ""That size'd do.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget stood up from where she was poking around in the dresser drawer. She looked where he pointed and arched an eyebrow. ""You sure? Its rather small, isn't it? surely i would think you were bigger."" She then did a double take. ""I mean&#160;needed bigger!"" She covered her hand over her mouth, eyes wide. ""'m so sorry."" she mumbled.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius stared at Bridget for a moment before doubling over in laughter. ""That was perfect,&#160;Jones. Let me assure you, I AM bigger. You have no idea."" He managed to stop laughing long enough to eye the dresser again. ""But maybe you're right. How about that one?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Its lopsided."" She whispers, as she rubbed her hand against her flushed cheek, still in disbelief of what she said. ""I'm really really sorry,"" she says to him, as she looked away from him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  This just set Sirius off laughing again. ""Calm down, would you? I'm not offended. It's nice to know that you think so well of my...size..."" he burst into another fit of snickers.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She couldn't help but make a smile and then turned away from him. 'Ah yes, this one ought to do. Five drawers, oak, and smells like Pine."" She was trying very hard to not blush when she was. She silently told herself how stupid she was being.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""I'm very concerned with the scent, yes,"" he said, turning to look at the dresser. ""Though it worries me that it smells like one tree when it's made of another. A little questionable, wouldn't you say?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""I..would think so?"" She says quietly, letting her hair cover her cheek as she looked down at the dresser. ""Could just spray it with cat piss..you know..to match.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius snorted and wrinkled his nose. ""That would involve purchasing a cat, wouldn't it? If I ever get a cat, I want you to hex me back to my senses. I'm entrusting you with this very important duty.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Al..Alright,"" she says grinning at him. ""With pleasure. Now...I think you should get that one, its on sale."" She points to a dresser with a rather mysterious mirror attached to it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius studied the dresser in question for a moment, tilting his head and grinning at his reflection. ""All right. It's got a nice view, at least,"" he said, turning toward the register and pointing his choice out to the old man.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""It has everything you could need, from built in drawers to-"" she opens a drawer and sniffs it. ""mmm...chocolate.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius spun around to inspect the drawer. ""Chocolate? Somebody left chocolate in a dresser? I love this place. I wonder if Remus owned this once.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She pulls out a bag of M&Ms. ""Hope they aren't stale"" and she rips the bag open.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius reached out his hand and waggled his fingers for some candy. ""Probably won't kill us, right?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She turns the bag over and dumps a handful onto his palm. ""How much is this thing anyways? A couple quid?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius shrugged and stuffed the M&Ms into his mouth. ""Iunno,"" he muttered around them, ""Don't care, either,"" he added after he swallowed. ""I can afford it, anyway.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She arches an eyebrow at him. He obviously had money or had little concept of it. ""Right, well let me go tell this guy which one is the car. Don't...wander off or anything, okay?"" She tells him as she pushed the bag into his hand.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Yes, mum,"" Sirius sighed, waiting until she had turned around to duck behind a particularly tall dresser and crouch down. No time like the present to play hide and seek!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She went over and spoke for a few minutes to the old man, and turned to point at the dresser. She stared back at the furniture, eyes wide.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  ""Sirius?"" She called quietly, looking around. When the old man asked her what was wrong, she shook her head. She then started to walk around. ""Sirius?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She moved from dresser to dresser, and stood next to the one of the ones they had been looking at. She called him again. ""Sirius!!""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius was about to crawl across the floor to another dresser when Bridget came up beside his current hiding place. He stopped dead right beside her leg and looked up.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She sighed and drummed her nails on the dresser top, looking around still. She watched as the old man brought a cart over to get the other dresser. ""Can't believe he left,"" she says quietly. ""Nice going, Bridget. Scare them all away."" She didn't even notice the boy staring up her skirt.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Nice knickers, Jones,"" Sirius said, straightening up. ""Haven't left,"" he added with his patented Don't-hate-me-I-am-adorable grin.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She stares at him. For a moment she looked as if she was going to yell at him, and then she put on a fake smile. ""Thanks,"" she says through grit teeth.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Oh dear. The grin was failing. He tried on a pout instead. ""Oh, don't look like that, Bridget. I'm just messing around.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She felt a twinge of guilt now and lamented. ""I'm sorry!"" She gave him a smaller honest grin. ""You are quite charming in a very strange way. At least, I think so.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  The grin came back. ""Why, thank you, Jones. You're not a bad sort yourself. And&#160;with nice knickers. I'd better pay for that, hadn't I?"" His grin slowly turned mischevious. ""The dresser, I mean. Not the knickers. I expect you aren't that sort of girl.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Bridget stares at him, trying very very hard to not laugh or yell. ""I..oh god."" She feels herself turning pink as he starts to walk off to pay. She can't help but glance down at his bum as he walks off.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  Sirius chuckled as he handed his cash to the store owner. The man raised an eyebrow at him, but Sirius just gave him an innocent look. ""Women, eh?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  She realizes she ought to be doing something, walks to the door behind Sirius. ""I'm going out..to unlock the car and trunk, alright?"" She calls to him.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Sirius/462b7fda.jpg"">  ""Right,"" Sirius agrees, stuffing his change into his pocket and following. ""You want to drive this time, or are the deers still haunting you?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd003.jpg"">  Her hand froze over the door knob and she looked back at him over her shoulder. ""You can drive,"" she said with a semi-disturbed look and then quickly smiled before going out the door."

<b>3:50 am</b> It has  been a long time since I wrote in this diary. A lot has happened since the end of term, and not any of it is anything rather good. I beleive the last time I wrote was when Amos broke up with me, and that in itself was a huge blow. Here I was letting myself fancy him even more, and like a shot int he dark, it happened. Can't blame him though, even I wouldn't date a blubbering mess like me.

I haven't been eating. I haven't been doing much of anything productive. At least, not since Daddy died. 

Oh God..I need a tissue.

<b>4:00 am</b> Its so surreal. I came home from a night at the club to find...find..and it was me who saw it first. I recognized it from the Quidditch game at Hogwarts. A ginormous skull shaped like a muffin hanging in the night sky, with a squiggly shaped snake thing coming through it. I felt a shiver run down my spine when I got out of my cab, and I heard laughter. <i>Laughter!</i> As if from nowhere! I ran up the steps to the flat, and...he was...just laying there on the floor, stiff as a board. It looked like he was asleep, peaceful and content. Only he was on the carpet,  not his armchair. ""Daddy,"" I remember saying, as I shook his lifeless stiff corspe. He was always stiff when he napped, so I didn't think anything on it at the moment. It was when he didn't wake  up that I started screaming.

....what's that noise?

<b>4:15 am</b> Was only the Guinea Pig turning in its wheel. 

<b>4:16 am</b> I must of passed out. The next thing I remember was waking up in a room at St. Mungo's with a screen around my bed. Exhaustion was what the healer woman called it, but she refused to tell me about my dad. Heart attack was what the small blurb in the London Post called it. 

All I can think about is how I wish I had never been born with these...abilities. These..special talents for magic and the like. It has been the absolute ruin of my life and those close to me.

And to make matters worse, I am on edge. I am neither happy nor angry, but generally depressed. I even snapped at Amos, and I felt so rotten afterwards. I don't even remember what I said to him, and I know he won't talk to me anymore...not that he was doing very much of it anyways. He dropped me, got rid of the baggage and moved on, while I sat here hoping I could change enough to entice him back.

At least I lost over 20 lbs.

But what difference does it make if I'm alone. 

Caradoc...I can't bother him. I saw him for ten minutes at the Cain party, but he had to run off...Lily was waiting for him. I'm..happy for him. He...I know he's like a brother to me, but lately I have been thinking..thinking things about him I shouldn't. I don't think he would ever see me as someone to fancy, really. 

God..I need help. I need to get out of this flat.

I'm out of ciggies. Bugger.

<b>4:30 am</b> Mummy's already engaged to remarry.

The bloody man has an <i>orange</i> tan! One of those spray in the bottle can deals. Can't bloody beleive this.

Oh, and I failed my classes...no bloody surprise there.

Wish I had osmeone..anyone to talk to. Not even tak, just sit and stare at. 

Anyone?"

Daddy's memorial is in two days. They are going to bury him in the graveyard at Little Hangleton. He grew up there. Its where he met mum...and they got married. 

<strike>Still can't believe I left my diary public. They all probably saw what I wrote. No wonder Caradoc doesn't speak to me. Amos probably hates me, as I am a hateful bitch. At least Andromeda Black and the Helmet clad Tonks like me. That's always good, right?</strike>"

<b>Where:</b> Bridget's mum's new fiance's flat, St. Ottery Catchpole - Devon
<b>When:</b> 3:00 pm

<lj-cut text=""Caradoc and his wonderful magical tasty soup"">
PurpleKoalaGirl>  There is a short rap at the flat door, standing outside is none other than Caradoc with a large paper bag held in one arm. It likely holds the ingediants for his super secret soup.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  Bridget pokes her head up over the arm of the couch she had been laying on, attempting to watch the confuddled soap opera on the tele. She stares at the door, and wonders curiously if that was their door. In this besragged old building, the walls were paper thin, and she was always hearing bangs, shouts, and slams of doors from as much as six stories up. She side glanced to the bedroom, and figured her mum was indeed out..shopping with Geraldo again..her joke of a fiance with a very bad orange tan and white teeth that blind. Bridget got up, still dressed in her pajamas at...four in the afternoon, and with bedhead, and shuffled in her fuzzy slippers to the door. Pressing her cheek to the door, she attempted to listen.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  Just as the girl presses her cheek to the door, another tuneful rap is sent against the wood. A melody which is infamous of Caradoc himself.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  Her eyes went wide at that, and her jaw dropped open. The shock of hearing...and..before she could think she was fumbling for the doorknob, ready to swing the door open fast and wide and give him the biggest ""hello"" she could muster. Unfortuntly, there was a ""chink"" as the chain caught, and Bridget hit the side of her face with the short-stopping door. ""Oooooooh"" she groaned as her palm pressed against her cheek.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  Wincing for her he takes a step forward. ""Are you quite 
alright, Bridge? Nasty thing, those chains, never know quite when their going to attack."" He grins cheekily, waiting to be let in.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She snerks, both from trying to not laugh or make a cry at her throbbing pain, and fumbles with one hand to drop the chain. Turning her back to the door, she &#160;walks to the couch to lean a hand on it as she grips at her cheek, her somewhat unwashed hair falling over her shoulder. ""owww.."" she breathes lightly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He steps through the door with almost animated footing, a near clownish dance as he holds up his bag proudly. ""Now which way to the!-"" He stops and looks around the tiny space, his hat tilting to one side of his head. ""Kitchen?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She stares at him, blinking slowly. She seems to be taking him in slowly, and starts to make a small grin when she realized he was asking a question. ""Oh..right..um..there's a small kitchenette thing over here,"" she waves her hand to the closet type room by the tv, and puts her hands down at her sides. She gives him a smile, one cheek impressivly pinker than the other. ""Thank you.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Say no more, say no more."" He waves her thank you's off with a casual hand, turning to walk towards the 'closet kitchen' and setting his bag down on the seat of a nearby chair. First thing was first, he takes out a ...frilly apron and ties it first around his neck and then behind his waist. ""My mothers."" He says bashfully before proudly placing a tall stereotypical chef's hat a top his head. ""Now I am going to need a pot.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She follows him to the closet, and leans against the doorframe. She nearly chokes with laughter at seeing him drape himself with an apron. She nods, her cheeks turning pink, to show approval, and then slaps a hand to her mouth to choke back a laugh. She then looks around. ""I...we have an urn."" She stares at the tabacoo urn on the floor next to a plastic potted plant.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  His face goes a little green at the thought. "". . .what do you guys use to cook with? Surely not an urn.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""I wouldn't know..I'm not allowed to cook here. Not with magic, at least."" She says, copying his disgusted look.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""No magic at all, in fact."" She looked suriously at his bag, wondering what was inside it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Hn, no worries, I suppose it is a good thing I brought my own! Not very big though, but it will do the job nicely."" He digs around the bottom of his bag before pulling out a small pot and placing it on the burner. ""I do love that new look you're going for, Bridget. Tell me, how do you get your hair just so?"" He winks.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She gives him a very confused look. ""Whaa.."" she starts to say and then leans back from the doorway. A reflection of her head appears in the fogged mirror hanging ont he wall, and she realizes her wild hair. ""Oh bugger,"" she mumbles, and looks back at him. ""Thanks,"" she says sarcastically. ""Hours of practice i guess."" She then shrugs.

<PurpleKoalaGirl>  Pulling out some carrots he takes out a wooden board and begins to dice them to perfection! Wow, a man who can cook, ladies eat your hearts out. Then once he is done with that he fills the pot halfway up with water and rummages through the rest of his bag to procure the beef broth and other veggies. ""It shows.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""You're teasing me,"" she says quietly, but her attention is on his hands as he whips everything together. Another secret revealed about him..she never knew he cooked..this fast. ""Do you need...um..help?"" She says hesitantly, thinking she would just ruin it anyways.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Not at all! I am here to take care of you."" He says this, back turned to her as a blush creeps across his cheeks.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She was biting her bottom lip, and felt her cheeks start to flush, and looks to the side quickly. If she saw him blush or not, it wasn't known. She was probably thinking back to her emotional outburst in her diary, and how she completly possibly confused things. ""I..I'm okay, really."" She says in a small voice, studying the old wall paper of peeling kitties.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He dumps the rest of the veggies into the pot with the broth and adds a few spices that quickly fill the air and tease the nostrils. ""You don't have to lie about it, Bridget."" Caradoc peers over his shoulder at her, his expression quite serious. ""I know how you must be feeling.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She glances at him quickly, her eyes wide, and seeming to be unable to look at one point but travel around his face. ""I..I'm thinking I shouldn't go back."" She says to him, but seems quite vacant as to what she is saying.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Go back where?"" He blinks at her, leaning against the 'counter.' Caradoc's eyes widen for a moment. ""You can't possibly mean school?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She drops her head, and stares downwards at her worn pink slippers.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Why don't you want to go back? You want to stay here? On the couch?"" He tilts his head, perhaps flustered at the idea of being cut off from her all year. ""Is it because of all this...stuff going on? Are you afraid?""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She brings her hand up to her mouth,a nd slowly starts to nibble at her nail. When he says those things, she looks &#160;up sharply. ""I'm very afraid."" Hold me, said a small voice in her mind.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""You don't need to be afraid Bridget."" His expression softens. ""I won't let anything happen to you.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""You...but....you...and her.."" She starts to say, not at all able to finish a sentence,a nd waves her hands about.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""And..it..um..""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Her?"" He blinks. ""You mean Lily? Well yes, I won't let anything happen to her either. In fact, as Head Boy I will do my best to make sure everyone is safe.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  Bridget knew she was mucking this up, and tilted her head and gave him a forced warm grin. ""I know,"" she says. The more she grinned, the more she felt like beating herself over the head with the soup spoon. ""Hogwarts is probably the saftest&#160;place right now, anyways, for..ones like me.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""That it is, but most importantly it is where I will be."" He nearly chokes at his words and turns around right away to stir at the soup. ""The idea of you being here while I am there....I don't much like it.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She stares at his back, and blinks fast to stop herself from letting tears fall. She slowly exhales and then says something she probably said before, but not in a long time. ""And I couldn't bear anything without you around. Being there, here."" &#160;Her voice is steady, but a slight hiccup. She stares at him, her eyes wetting.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Then it's settled."" He smiles at the soup. ""You'll come back with me to school and-"" He turns around but his words get caught in his throat as he glances at her saddened eyes. He lets go of the spoon, letting it rest in the pot as he steps forward to envelope her warmly in his arms.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  I won't cry, oh i won't cry, she tells herself, and the moment he wraps his arms around her, she does cry. Damn it, I am crying, she thinks and says outloud.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""Bugger hell,"" followed by another muttered curse word.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  His arms tighten around her as he rests his cheek against her messy hair. ""You don't have to hold back your tears for me.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""I have done this for two bloody weeks,"" she mumbles, in between hiccups and sniffles. Her cheek presses against his shoulder, and makes the strap of his mother's apron soggy.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""That doesn't mean anything, you just keep crying until you don't feel you need to anymore. You have experienced a great loss, Bridge. It is normal to cry.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She pulled away from him just a little, so that her nose was unintentionally close to his. ""I..know.."" she says hoarsly, blinking fast, and sniffing. ""And if I wasn't a..witch..this would of never happ..happened."" She says, looking right at him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He presses his forehead to hers and sighs. ""It isn't your fault.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""I'm so pathetic,"" she says softly, looking at his lips, then his cheek then at his eyes.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Stop it, Bridget. Putting yourself down is not going to make the situation any better.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""I should stop that then,"" she says, and without thinking presses her lips against his.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  All at once his heart begins to race while his thoughts blurr. He almost kisses her back, not moving his lips away, but his thoughts fall to Lily and what she would think if she saw this. He...he...he's so confused! Stepping back he shakes his head. ""Sorry, I...must have slipped forward."" Blushing her turns around and adds more salt to the soup, sweat begining to trickle down his forehead.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She stood there staring at him, her lips still in a pucker at kissing him, and realizes finally he had moved away. Feeling a drastic pain that could be hope smashing apart, she made a small laugh. ""Right, you're quite clumsy, like me. Damn these floors."" She then stepped out of the kitchenette and walked over to the couch, turning off the t.v.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Soup is almost done."" He says quietly, had the t.v still been on she likely wouldn't have heard him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""Can't wait,"" she calls back, a little loudly than she should of. She starts pushing random things off the coffee table, including her diary, a quill, papers, magazines, old shoe laces, and other various items.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He takes out a bowl after much searching in the cupboard and spoons a good portion into it, placing a spoon into it for her to use. Carrying it out of the kitchenette he sets it down on the table and takes a seat across from her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She makes a small grin and leans over the bowl, holding her hair back. She carefully blows at the steamy stuff. ""Smells...it actually..ha..smells good,"" she said, as if surprised. "" I mean, I knew it would be!"" She adds, as she looks at him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He chuckles. ""Oh ye of little faith, Bridget. I happen to be a cooking mastermind!"" Yes, so ingenius that he can make....vegtable soup!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""MMmmhmm!"" She says, nodding, and pushes a bowlfull into her mouth. She stares at him, until her cheeks turn red. ""Hot..very very hot.."" she breathes

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  His eyebrows shoot up and he laughs again. ""Careful now.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""It burns"" she chokes,somewhere between laughing and coughing.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""If you laugh it will come out your nose, you know.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She starts laughing harder now, and then sneezes.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""Ewwww.."" she whines, as snot and soup cover her hands.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""What did I say?"" He tsks and pulls some tissue out of the nearby box and hands it to her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She giggles unstoppably, and takes the tisue. ""..no..hahaha..clue.."" She sniffs, as if at that meca of half crying half laughing, half unable to pronounceiate due to a half burned tongue.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""I have to go run some errands for my mother, but I will be back tomorrow for the service."" He takes off his hat and places it back in the bag.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She sits up quickly, and then goes to stand. ""Do oyu really??"" If she sounded disappointed, she didnt mean to.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Yeah...but I will be back tomorrow, I promise."" He grins.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She feels herself flush, and nods. ""I look foreward to it. You're the best thing to happen.."" she then tilts her head and smiled truthfully. ""All week.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He blushes at that and picks up his bag. ""Well, I'll be seeing you."" He heads out the door, having forgotten to take the apron off.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""Oh! Sam!"" She callsout quickly, moving towards him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He comes back in as red as a strawberry. ""Heh, I guess I forgot."" He starts undoing the apron.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She chuckles. ""Can I least give you a hug good bye?"" She wasn't thinking right, obviously.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Course."" His voice nearly cracks at that.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  In a flash, her arms are around him, giving him a clingy sort of hug, which probably prevent him from taking the apron off.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  He laughs and hugs her back. ""I need to get this thing off.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  ""Oh, sorry,"" she says quietly, and steps back to let him, but not before giving him a quick kiss ont he cheek. ""It is..your colour,"" she says sarcastically.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Yeah, sure."" He blushes and shakes his head. ""Now I really got to go. I will be here first thing in the morning!""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She nods. ""Well go then!"" she orders, and half pushes him out the door to the outer hallway.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6888296.jpg"">  ""Er...bye."" He grins childishly and heads down the way.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd075.jpg"">  She makes a sharp wave and closes the door behind her, and the ""chunk"" of the chain going back up is heard."

<b>Where:</b> Library
<b>When:</b> Night; June 9, 1976

<lj-cut text=""This... this isn't working... out as well as I'd thought it would be"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Sighing, Amos sat at a table in the library, his face covered with his hands and elbows on the table. Bridget could have.. said she was busy or something. She could have told him that she'd see him the next day. Amos groaned, lowering his hands and folded his arms across the table. This was going to be hard. It was going to be really, really hard... 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She padded her way into the library, wearing purple pajama pants with yellow kitties on them, and a blue t-shirt. She was in socks, and had dishevled hair, but she seemed to not care. She wandered around the library, looking this way and that.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Amos rested his chin onto his hands and stared at the table that stretched out before him. He tapped his fingers along the table, continuing to wait for her. A sudden thought appeared within his mind. What if... What if she were late? Or never came? That'd at least give him another day to think things over. ....Didn't it?

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She wandered around, and she was sure she had missed him. What if he left, she thought. Or was in the loo? Surely she had not seen him, hard at work studying. She always wondered why he didn't just relaxe. She did....and she was failing. She decided that was probably as bad idea afterwords. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Looking up, his gray eyes focused on Bridget walking around. He was sitting in the back of the library after all.. Maybe that's why she hadn't found him yet. However, he could just say there... Hoping she'd never found him. And he could tell her the next day that he waited and waited and she never showed up. Yes, that seemed like a good idea.... But, he just couldn't do that to her ontop of breaking up with her. Sitting up slowly, Amos casually leaned back into his chair. ""Oy, Bridget!"" he called out to her, even though he was harshly hushed by all of the students still studying.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She froze in her step, and then moved her head towards the sound of her name. She saw him sitting way over there, and the look of almost horror that she gave at him shouting out for her. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She ducked her head and shuffled over, blushing from the Looks she got.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> He watched her and focused on what she was wearing. Amos didn't change his expression however, and continued to stare at her until she got to his table. He nodded towards a chair, gesturing her to sit.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She sat down quickly, and noticed he was staring at her. She looked down, wondering if she had something on her shirt.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She looked back at him, giving him a curious look. ""What?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Amos sighed deeply, and swallowed. ""How are you, Bridget?"" he asked most innocently.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She raises her eyebrows. ""I'm good,"" she says, nodding. ""You?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""Could be better,"" he answered most honestly and rubbed his forehead. ""Bridget... I........"" He suddenly couldn't continue speaking. Amos just.. he couldn't do it. He couldn't hurt her. But.. he couldn't continue cheating on her as well.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She stared at him, eyes widening as he rubbed his head. ""You.....""She says, pouting in curiosity as she always did. ""You...have a headache?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> He set his hand onto the table and closed his eyes. ""No, I mean, yes, I mean....."" He opened his eyes and looked away, at the towering bookshelves. ""There's no easy or kind way in saying what I'm about to say.....""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She followed his gaze to the bookshelf.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""What do you mean?"" She says, as she looks at him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""This... this isn't working... out as well as I'd thought it would be,"" he said, still not looking at her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She starts to glance at his book, thinking he meant his studying, when she realized that it was apretty silly thing to say about...study...ing....

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She then looks up at him, staring at him, her mouth open slightly. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""Merlin, I'm so sorry... But, I can't do this anymore Bridget. You can't love someone who doesn't love you back...."" Amos at last turned and looked at 
her, giving an expression of great sympathy.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She stares dumbly at him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""But-""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""It doesn't work that way..,"" he continued. ""Ah... I just got into the relationship too quickly. And.."" A voice within his head repeatedly told him not to confess he'd cheated on her. ""And.."" He couldn't come up with anything else..... other than the truth.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""But-"" She tried again.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""But what?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She just stared at him, her mouth open, as if she couldn't find what to say.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She sits back in her chair, staring at the table top. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""I can change,"" she says quietly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""No... Bridget, no!"" Amos said quickly. ""It's not you."" He sighed, and continued softly. ""Not you at all.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""I'm not very good with realtionships either,"" she says as she leans foreward in her chair, staring at him again, looking more down then surprised now.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Furrowing his brow, he looked at her confused. He wasn't expecting her to say something like that.. ""I'm sorry...,"" he said again.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""Amos,"" she said quietly, as she now had her arms wrapped around herself.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""Yes?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""Didn't you tell me...that you wouldn't hurt me?"" She says in a small voice as she stared down.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Amos nodded, knowing he well enough did hurt her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""I did.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She sighed hard, her breath shaky now, probably from her nerves being shot. ""You are."" 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She then laid her head in her arms on the table.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""I know....,"" he replied softly, and looked away. Amos then stood, and looked down at her. ""I'll understand if you hate me, Bridget.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She mumbled something, and then brought her head up, whiping her now damp cheeks. ""No. I don't."" She says quietly, blinking fast as she looked up at him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""I was very lucky to of been with you,"" she said quietly as she stared down at the table. ""I'll have you know that.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> She probably would if he'd told her the rest of the truth, but Amos just didn't have the heart to. This... this was enough. ""And I was lucky to have 
you, Bridget. Believe it or not.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""You say that now,"" she mumbles, sniffing hard.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""God this is horrible."" She starts, as she covers her face with her hands, her shoulders shaking.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Amos shook his head and sighed deeply, yet again. ""I'll just.. leave you now. I'm sure the last person you want to see is me right now.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""No.."" she says as she gets up, unsteadily. She wipes her face again. ""You have to...s..study. I..I got packing to do.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""Sorry I interrupted,"" she said as she looks for the door.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""You didn't. I wasn't studying anyway.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> ""I need to go pack,"" she says, not looking at him. ""I need to..go smoke and pack.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> Her hands shake as she tries to figure out where to put them. She didn't have pockets.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> ""I'm just going to go to sleep now... Goodnight Bridget."" Amos did indeed felt horrible, so that must mean something.  After running his fingers through his hair, he shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and walked away from the table.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd120.jpg""> She watched him as he moved away, and then dropped back to sit on the chair she was in, now leaning her arm on the tabletop surface. The shock was still there, and as its veil disappeared, it hit her. It finally hit her hard, and she let out a loud sharp cry. She buried her head in arms and cried, not caring what anyone heard.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Amos/7d74e187.jpg""> Amos froze, hearing a sudden sobbing not far behing him. He didn't feel nearly as good as he thought he would. Amos had imagined feeling the guilt lift off of him like it was supposed to when he set everything back to normal. But no... It didn't. He felt the worst he'd ever had.

<b>Who:</b>Bridget Jones and Caradoc Dearborn
<b>Where:</b> Ravenclaw Common Room
<b>When:</b> An hour or so after she talks to Amos

<lj-cut text=""Taking a trip?"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> Bridget, who was now puffy eyed and red cheeked, had finally managed to finish packing. The break up that night had been enough to push her over the edge of reason, and all she wanted was to get away. She wanted to go home to her mother's and stay there forever, never to come out. She dragged her trunk down the steps to the Common Room, the box slamming on each step one at a time. She still had two more bags upstairs of clothes, plus her diary.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> Sitting by the stairs just happens to be a familar doe eyed gentleman. He perks an eyebrow at Bridgets efforts before getting to his feet. """"Taking a trip?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""Leaving."" She mutters as he lets the trunk slide down to the floor the rest of the way.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> He winces while the trunk hits the ground floor. ""Leaving?"" He looks back up to her. ""But Bridget, it isn't the end of the year yet. . .""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I don't  need to stay. I mean, I don't have to take the rest of the 
NEWTS."" She tells him as she makes a small wave with her hand and starts back upstairs.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""So you're just going to leave?"" He stares up at her retreating 
form. ""Were you even going to bother saying goodbye?"" His eyes seem pained.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She turns and looks at him, her eyes looking red and her hair more dishevled than normal. ""Of course I was,"" she said quietly, looking at him and then down.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""-know you're busy""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> His mouth gapes open at this and it almost seems that his lower lip threatens to tremble. ""...you would do that?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I don't know what I'm..doing."" She says after a second, and then slumps down to sit ont he steps, head in hands.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""This is because of him, isn't it."" He heads up the stairs to sit at her side. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She shrugs quietly, and moves to lean her cheek against the bannister.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""Its a lot of things.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""So tell me about it."" He wraps an arm around her shoulder and gives her a comforting squeeze.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She looks over at him, her expression sad, sadder than ever before. ""You were right,"" she tells him, and figured he would understand without going into much more detail than that.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> He nods his head slowly and tightens his grip gently. ""You can't run away from your hurt, Bridget.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""And I failed everything on top of it, but we knew that would happen."" She whispers, looking down at her socked feet, feeling his arm around her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""You will do better next year, I will be here to help you, right in your class."" He grins.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She sniffs and smiles at that, looking at him. ""You'll let me cheat off of you then?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""I'll help you study."" He laughs. ""And we could be lab partners!""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She makes an attempt to smile more. ""I really think I fucked up this time, Sam. I mean, Diggory was..um..""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""Was what?"" His smile falls for a moment.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""full of fuckwittage."" She says quietly, and gave him a forced grin to show she's seemingly okay with it all.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""Live and learn.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""An interesting way of putting it my dear."" He laughs. ""But very appropriate.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She rolled her eyes a little and made a sound like a half laugh/half snort.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""Now, about this trunk. I think it needs to be going back.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I think it needs to stay,"" she said, as she whiped her nose with her sleeve.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I;m so sick of school right now, I just want to go home.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""I don't think you can just. . .leave.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She sighs and shrugs. ""Looks like I'm stuck here then.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""Alright, trunk goes back."" She says as she stands.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""I'd help but. . ."" He points to the charmed stairs. ""I rather value my unbroken bones.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> She gave him a small grin. ""I appreciate the thought  though."" She started to stand, but before doing so, moves her arms around him and hugs him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> He hugs her back and smiles warmly against her shoulder, taking her scent in. ""I would miss you far too much if you left, especially without saying goodbye.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I won't leave you, not like that."" She says quietly, feeling immesnly guilty now. She moves her head and kisses his cheek near his ear.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""I'm sorry to be such a self absorbed bitch.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> It makes his muscles tighten, the touch of her lips and the closeness to his ear. Yet he shakes it off inwardly, leaning back to offer her a cheerful grin. ""No worries.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""How's um..um.."" she starts to say, fumbling on Evans' name.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> ""She's. . .great."" He nods. ""Doing well, stressed from exams I think a bit, but who isn't really?"" He gets up and starts to head down the stairs. ""Come by later, ok Bridget?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/Pdvd100.jpg""> ""Sure,"" she says as she bends down to pull the trunk up the steps.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/882aefa4.jpg""> He grins and heads towards his dorms, he had a bit more studying to do."

<b>Who:</b> Amos and Bridget
<b>Where:</b> His dorm room/bed

<lj-cut text=""I just..I think..I am in love with you."">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She was sitting up in the bed, wearing a t-shirt and panties, as she brought her knees up to her chest. She unfolded the letter she had gotten that one night via mystery owl and read it over again. She squinted in the dim light and shifted in the bed, moving to lean on her side as she held the paper up to the ceiling to catch the light from the window. This only made her lean into Amos's back as he laid next and facing away from her. She gazed at the letter, even though she already knew what it said. She sighed softly, wondering why it still...bothered her. She laid the letter on her side and cupped her cheek in her palm, watching him sleep.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> As if on cue, Amos blinked, waking up. He could practically feel Bridget's gaze burn into his back. Sighing, knowing well enough that he'd politely asked her to not do that. He might as well do so again. ""Bridget, will you please not watch me while I sleep."" He rolled over onto his back and looked at her. ""Please?"" 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Yawning, he ran his fingers through his hair, unknowingly messing it up as he did so. Amos rubbed his eyes. ""What time is it?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""I don't know,"" she said quietly, as she turned to look for a clock, or a watch, or a sundial.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> Not finding anything she turns her head the other way, drawing her legs up to herslef again, her socked feet crossing at the ankles. She glances out at the window. ""Late...or early.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Ah...."" Sitting up, his gray eyes went to the letter resting on her side. Amos arched a brow. "".....What's that?"" What, was she studying in his bed? Hm, that was certainly a first.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She looked back at him, and her eyes went wide. 'N..noithing."" She said as she went to grab it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Nothing, hmm?"" He playfully grabbed it before her and opened it with a smile, his eyes looking down upon the page. Then, his smile quickly faded as he looked up and stared at her. ""...This is it then? Why do you still have it?"" He tossed the letter onto the bed.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She stares at him, her mouth opening slightly. She then looks away, her gaze following where he tossed it as it lands on the very edge of his bed. She then looks back at him, giving him one of those looks. The sort of look that a puppy dog would make, mixed with her being unsure.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""It...bothers me?"" She said, more of a question than answer.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Right. Makes no sense at all that you'd carry with you something that bothers you.."" Amos certainly wasn't the most cheerful of types when he first wakes up. He sighed and rolled onto his side, with his back away from her, as he was before he awoke. Still, Amos didn't sleep, but stare out around the room. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She watched him as he laid there, and then quietly laid back down, on her back. She folded her hands on her chest and stared up at the ceiling, unable to get back to sleep.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She kept thinking about ""What ifs...""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Really Bridget, you shouldn't worry about things so much,"" he said suddenly. ""Just learn to let go.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She feels herself tense up at that, and then blinks fast, coming outof her own thoughts. She turns her head and stares at the back of his. She stared first at his hair and then glanced down, to wear his shoulders disappeared under the covers. ""I'm..not. honestly.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos rolled onto his back again and gave her a look that told her he didn't believe her. ""You just said that the letter bothered you."" He spoke as if he were irritated, and he was. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She turnes and lays on her side, wrapping her arm over his chest, nuzzling her cheek against his closer arm.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""It was all a lie, right."" She says, asking for perhaps the fifthteenth billion time.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Right,"" he said, stretching on the word.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""And you are happy with me, right?"" She says quietly, staring at chin.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""I mean, I'm sure you would tell me if, and I was lousy with everything. Which I probably am.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She starts mumbling..again.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos furrowed his brow, a certain pang of guilt going through him at that moment. ""Of course I am, Bridget."" Then, after she finished speaking, he replied, ""Good Merlin, you're not lousy with everything! I really wish you'd stop with that."" He let out a frustrated sigh.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""Well, tell me something I'm quite good with then,"" she says as she gets herself to sit up, staring down at him now. She has a curious look on her face, as if almost depserate to hear what he has to say.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""You're adorable, I told you that before,"" he said simply, giving her a look of seriousness mixed with annoyance.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""But don't I do anything..well?"" She shifts so leans over him. ""Aren't i sexy?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She raises her eyebrows, looking hopeful.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Yes, you do everything well!"" Amos answered with another sigh and sat up. He stretched out his arms, getting the feeling that he won't be falling back asleep any time soon.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She stares at him, and then looks him over a little, slowly smiling. She then leans in to kiss him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Returning the smile, he leaned foreward as well and placed his lips on hers, kissing her softly. After a moment he pulled away and looked into her eyes. ""Everything alright then?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She nodded a little, and then looked down, blushing. ""I really reallylike being with you, you know."" She says in a small whisper.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""Espeically after...last year with Daniel.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Yes, I'm certainly a step up from him, aren't I?""  She.. really, really liked being with him. ....My... Then, there was the mention of Avery. Who he knew treated her.. horribly.. But Amos was NOTHING like that fucker. Not a bloody thing similar. .....It was.. much too early, no matter the time, for this.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She choked, trying to not laugh. ""A step up?? Amos, you're a bloody god-send."" She said, and she wrapped her arms around his shoulders, hugging herself to him. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He blinked, staring out. Good Merlin. Any more, and he was sure she... He nearly stopped breathing at the thought. -loved him! Amos forced a smile, looking down at her and hugged her bag. ""Why... thank you, Bridget.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She pressed her nose into his bare chest and said something, but it came out muffled.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Hmmm? What was that?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She leaned back a little, enough to just look up at him but still embrace him. She started to say soemthing and then looked at him with bedroom eyes, and then proceeded to kiss again, gently.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos quickly kissed her back. Of course, little things like that always seemed to bother him. ""What... now? I keep on getting bits of what you're saying, but not all of it.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""Sorry.."" she says quietly as she brushes his hair down from where it was mussy. ""I just..I think..I am in love with you."" She says slowly and then arches her eyebrows as if to say ""Yes, that's it.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> His froze, and his face went pale. He laughed uncomfortable. ""Are-.. are you sure-y-y-.... you.."" Amos paused, finding it near impossible to say the next word.  He continued to open his mouth, but nothing came out. ""L..-L.....l-love me?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She was holding her breath, staring at him until he reacted. ""Y..Yes."" She tells him, sounding a little more confident, but not by much.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> ""I think I am falling in love..with..you.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She slowly smiles.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos swallowed. Bloody perfect. She was falling in love with him, meanwhile he was shagging every gal that smiled at him. Feeling as he was at that moment, he couldn't even force a grin. ""I.. think I'll try going back to sleep now. Night, Bridget."" He rolled over and pulled the comforter and sheets over his head, focusing on the inside of the bedsheets and not sleeping. How could he?! His first actual, real girlfriend, whom he was cheating on several times, just told him... she loved him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She still sits there, blinking stupidly as he lays back down. Had...he not understood what she was telling him? Her mind raced. The perfect moment she had envisioned, where he would profess his love in return, and then sweep her into his arms, kissing her madly....its what always happened in books, wasn't it? ""Amos...?"" She said quietly, her voice now hoarse.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Not saying anything in return, he quickly closed his eyes, pretending to be asleep. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She slowly laid back down next to him, and after watching him for another long moment, turns to face the other way, her back to his. She felt her heart pounding, and moved her arms to check her own pulse, confirming it. She wrinkled her nose, and blinked fast, telling herself she wasn't going to cry. Not...going..to..cry.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> It was then, the guilt got to him. What was he doing, ignoring her like that? Amos slowly brought down the sheets and peeked over them, at her. Amos made a loud obvious yawn. ""mmm, Bridget? Did you say my name? I was... drifting off. I'm sorry.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She turned her head, but not enough to look at him. She blinked fast and brought her hand up to wipe her eyes quickly. ""I..think so...but its okay. Good night."" She says quietly, and pressed her cheek back on the pillow. She brought her hands up under her cheek and let out a silent breath, trying to calm down.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos sighed and moved closer to her. Then, he wrapped his arms around her, and held her close. He wanted to say something.. anything about her loving him. The truth? No! Not the truth. Not about anything. Amos then closed his eyes, genuinely trying to get some sleep.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6791947-1.jpg""> She felt herself catch her breath as he did that, and then slowly realxed against him. Was he..really holding her? Her mind was asking. She slowly started to grin, even though she had her eyes closed. Yes...yes he was. He must reallylove me, she thought to herself, feeling so much better now."

The owl hooted again, louder, causing Bridget to sit up straight in her bed. The owl, which stared at her, held its leg out, indicating a parchment note tied.

She pulled herself up to sit and took the roll off the bird. The owl nipped at her finger and flew back out the half opened window.

"event","Who: Amos and Bridget
Where: hallway
When: After the Avery/Amos fight (Saturday after the dance)

<lj-cut text=""...Bugger"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos sighed, scanning the Great Hall as he re-entered it. With his hands folded behind his back, he casually stood. Amos could only wonder what  actions Avery would take. Keep quiet, same as before? (Amos could only hope for that.) Or tell the entire school? Amos knew that he'd just have to lie and say that Avery had been lying. How could such a sweet gentleman such as Amos commit such a horrible act? He never could, that's what. Mentally nodding, Amos stuck with that.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> Having finally gotten fed up of the dance, and wanting to get out scary britches and girdle, Bridget made her way to the door to leave, but not before gripping at the seat of her costume and yanking her wedgie away. ""Bugger,"" she mumbled. She stopped and fixed her costume, and, holding her bunny ears in one hand, looked to the side, scanning the crowd by the stage. Seeing no one she cared to talk to, or even had energy to do so, she turned to go. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> His gray eyes fell upon Bridget suddenly and Amos's eyebrows unknowingly rose. He exhaled, curious then as to what he should do. Should he talk to her? Be the same as he had been? At not being able to decide any sort of action, Amos simply stood.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She practically ran into him, and she managed to move over at the last second, mumbling a small ""excuse me,"" obviously taking no real notice of who it was. She glanced up at him fully, and her eyes went wide. ""Oh....God...Amos. Hello."" She breathed.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos gave a stiff nod, as well as a wide, forced smile. ""Hello..""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She hesitated for a minute and then grinned as well, probably equally forced.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He looked away, again looking around at the crowd. Again his mind was blank, and knew not of what to say next.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She stared at him, and then decided quickly on what she wanted to say. ""Did you really chase him? I heard you chased Avery down the hall.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""I followed him, yes.."" Amos replied slowly, not looking at her. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""It was quite...he deserved it, really."" She says, still watching him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Deserved what, exactly?"" He glanced at her with an arched brow. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Amos, he started a fight with you! If anything he deserved to be beaten to a bloody pulp!"" She squeaks, her hands fidgeting with her ears.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""And if he comes back to this dance, I dare say I won't have a thing to do with him.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos shrugged lightly. ""....Good to know."" Bloody hell this was awkward. Why did he get the sudden feeling that he couldn't lie to her?

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Well,"" she says in an almost sigh. ""Enjoy the rest of the dance,"" she goes to turn, feeling awkwardly capable of only being formal with him, and it was making her uneasy.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos watched her do so. ""Bridget...."" He kept his mouth open, but no words left it. Fuck, he'd lost his mind just moments ago. Had he now lost his ability to speak?

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She looked over her shoulder quickly, her gaze meeting his, and her lips parted, surprised. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She then looks aprehensive. ""..yes?"" She says, looking sheepish.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""We... need to have a talk,"" he'd replied without thinking. He mentally kicked himself for saying that, after realizing he did so. What did he mean by that, anyways? Amos had never really.. had much of a talk with anyone.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She had a look of horror on her face for a moment, and then immedaitly relaxed, not sure what to say. ""A..alright,"" she said, her heart beating fast now. What did he want to say, she wondered. Probably something about her being a piranha on his image or something. She always thought the worse.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos nodded and decided to go with what came first to his mind. There was no faking it now. At least, not until some things were cleared. ""...About what happened earlier,"" Amos continued, referencing to Bridget's reaction at him kissing Miranda. It was something he very much wanted to figure out.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She took a deep breath and slouched her shoulders, making herself appear juvenile. 'What about..earlier?"" She asks, wondering if he meant the fist fight or what.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""it wasn't my fault, you know."" She adds. ""he came up right behind me. I didn't ask him to come as my date."" She said, refering to Avery, already jumping the gun on his inquiry.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""No.. not that.."" Amos clenched his jaw slightly. ""You seemed very distressed when you came upon Miranda and I.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""No I wasn't,"" she says quickly, lieing. She glances away, not meeting his eyes.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She fiddles with her ears some more and takes a few steps to the middle of the hallway outside the door.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos followed her. ""Yes.. you were,"" he said firmly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She took a deep breath and glanced down before looking at him, her eyes looking saddened, and she fumbled her mouth to say something.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""I..um....well...""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""It...doesn't..matter..?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Smirking, he titled his head in reaction to her words. ""It doesn't?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""You..made it perfectly clear to me that you are only pretending to date Miranda, regardless of how...real it looks,"" She says, trying to not let her waivering voice sound it as she spoke, her gaze looking more at his robes than his eyes.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He nodded. ""Yes I did..."" Amos paused, looking at her. ""Had you forgotten earlier this evening? Is that what it was?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She opened her mouth to say something, but didn't...staring up at him quickly. Her expression turned to one of embarassment, her cheeks flushing red. ""....eh.."" She glanced down at her ears, fumbling with them.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He looked away, suddenly becoming uncomfortable. ""Right. Well then.."" Amos had changed his focus from Bridget to a group of Hufflepuffs that seemed to be having a good time. A group that he could easily join and be in the constant spotlight with. ""It was nice talking to you, Bridget... I'll be going, now.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She stared at him, her eyes going wide. ""Oh..But.."" 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She stops herself and tries to not look overly disappointed. ""I mean, if you need to.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She squeezes her eyes shit, telling herself that it really shouldn't hurt this much.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""No, I don't need to..."" He said, sounding slightly irritated without knowing it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""But you are,"" she says, eyeing the girls as he had. ""Oh..I see."" She says, sounding a little dead pan.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Well, have fun then.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She eyes him quickly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos closed his eyes. He simply couldn't understand her. When he tried talking to her, she barely spoke. Now when he attempts to leave, she wants him to stay. He slowly turned his head to look back at her and opened his eyes halfway. Amos sighed. ""Bridget.. Do you wish for me to stay with you or go?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Stay..?"" She says in a whisper, her look extremly saddened, as her cheeks flushed red even more. She glanced at the girls as they walked away, and she felt herself make a sigh of relief.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He nodded slowly, and folded his arms across his chest, looking at her. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Are..."" she starts to say, taking a deep breath, closing her eyes a little. ""Are you still going to pretend to see her, or is it over now?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She didn't want to let on how much it was bothering her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""It's ended, yes.."" Amos could see that something was wrong, but he didn't really wish to press the matter.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She opened her eyes and found herself staring at him, not expecting that. ""You...really?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""It lasted a bit too long.."" Amos sounded a bit bored now. ""Though, I never would have expected it to end tonight, of all nights.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She seemed to fight a smile, her bottom lip quivering. ""Oh, yes, very unexpected,"" she says, and then takes a step to him, closing the gap. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""I'm sure your rather sad by this?"" She asks, staring at him as she chewed her bottom lip.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos smirked, remembering his bitter emotion towards Miranda at the time. ""Never.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She made a relieved sound, and, her gaze dropping to his mouth, finds herself starting to lean in towards him, as if attemtping to kiss him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos stared at her, really not wishing to have any physical contact with anyone. It was the first time, ever, that he felt that way and he wished to push away his bad mood, or at least cover it up with another emotion. That was it. He had to be happy. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She stopped what she was about to do, only just realizing it herself, and steps back from him. ""I'm...glad you don't fancy her, really. She's very...very...thin."" She says, sounding rather stupid. ""And I'm sorry I...uh...acted jealous.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""I understand,"" he said, even though he really didn't. Women were so confusing sometimes and Amos handled it the best he could. By smiling and nodding.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Are you going back in there,"" she says, nodding to the door of the dance.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Perhaps,"" Amos replied simply.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She made another forced grin and nodded. ""Fan..tastic."" She says, and points over her shoulder. ""I'm..going to change. Can't hardly breath is this thing.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He furrowed his brow at her, catching her tone. Amos smirked. ""Right.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She tilted her head and placed a hand on her cinched waist. ""If your wondering, I was told this would be a tart and vicar party...and I came as a scarlet woman."" She tells him, trying hard to not smile too much. ""I only found out it was a regular costume ball. I've been laughed at all evening.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""I'm sorry to hear that,"" he said, actually being quite sincere. ""Who told you?""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Vondila,"" she says in a very low voice, almost unaudible.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She clears her throat and repeats herself, ""Vondila told me the other day, and even suggested this,"" she says, waving her hands at herself.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She makes a small grin. ""I..did my best.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos nodded. ""Ahhh....."" He shook his head with a sigh. ""That girl, honestly.."" Amos gave a sneaky smile. ""In my opinion, however, I think your costume is fine. Even if it is a little... revealing."" However, since when have I complained about that? Amos thought, continuing to smile.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She perked up at that. ""Well!"" She says, arching her eyebrows. ""At least you are smiling now."" She takes her ears and put them back on. ""Did you see the tail?"" She turns to the side and points at the puffball on the top of her bottom.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He let out a laugh, keeping his eyes looking at the tail a few seconds longer than he should have. Then, he looked into her own eyes.  ""Yes, yes I did.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She rests the back of her hand behind her back and makes a wide smile, actually finding herself happier now. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Well, "" she says, glancing to the side. ""I should..go change then,"" she says slowly, glancing back at him, grinning still. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He returned the grin. ""You have fun doing that then.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Have fun at the dance, then,"" she says, giving him a closed lip smile.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos let out a sigh, again looking at the doors of the Great Hall, hearing all the voices of the students just beyond the doors, as well as the music playing. After all the events that he was involved in that night, Amos didn't feel like going back in. ""....I'll try,"" he said, before looking back at her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She watches the door as he did, and then glances at him after a minute, just as he looked at her. ""Oh well, if you want, you can come round later. I probably won't be doing anything.."" she says, biting the inside of her lip. ""Except maybe reading a book,"" she wonders if she should say she was doing something more so he doesn't think she has a lowely lonely existence. ""And organizing my Arithmacy notes, and researching the history of..of...trolls. Yes."" 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Very important, those trolls,"" she says, holding a finger up to make her point.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He rubbed his jaw slightly, where Avery had punched him and also where a bruise was most likely forming, though he gave a very insightful expression. ""Hmm.. That sounds very inviting.."" He lowered his hand and smiled at her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She smiled back at him, feeling her cheeks pinkening slightly, and ducked her head down so he wouldn't see it. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. <i>Hmmm</i>, she thought just then. <i>Is that a bit of dirt on my cleavage?</i> She quickly moved her hand over herself, whiping quickly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos slowly arched a brow, watching her do so and chuckled lightly.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She admires her handiwork for a second and then glances at hi, as if just realizing he had been watching. She makes a nervous laugh.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""umm...sorry.""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""It's fine."" Amos stared at Bridget, remembering that after that little moment with her, Miranda, and Caradoc in the courtyard, he'd planned on not continuing anything, well.. personal with her. It was time to move on to another girl. And yet.. Amos felt a sort of lingering attraction to her that he hadn't felt in quite the long time. Still.... Amos would have to push that away. He didn't have any desire to be chained down by a bloody relationship-type-of-thing anytime soon.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She grinned at him, finding herself staring at him in a truly admirable way. She had debated with herself for a long time before wither if he and her could...and then her feelings of insecurity kicked in as she felt the need to step back and let him on his way. She bit her bottom lip. ""Well,"" she says, grinning to him. ""I'm sure you want to go. Got things to do, you know,"" she says as she steps back again, still facing him. She felt warm and tingly, and just seeing him staring at her made her insides jump for joy. Must not get too excited, she told herself. This means nothing, she gathered. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> ""Yeah..."" Amos actually now had an idea of returning to Hufflepuff Tower. The only thing he really did want, at that moment, was sleep.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She nods dumbly, even though she really had no idea what she was seemingly agreeing with. She meant to leave, really, but kept finding hard..and awkward...to just go. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> He started to leave, stepping backwards. ""Goodnight then, Bridget."" Amos turned and started to walk away.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> ""Goodnight...."" she says in a voice he can here, and then ""Amos,"" which she practically whispers to herself. She felt herself longing to to call out to him quickly, but fought it back, almost desperatly. Don't make another fool of yourself bridget, she tells herself. Remember he doesn't really fancy you that much. She concluded, as she remembered earlier conversations.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/6548417-2.jpg""> Amos turned after a moment and looked back at her.  He was confused that he did that and chuckled at himself, only continuing on down the hall.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v289/ElizaFanArt/Illusions%20RP/icons/ca5e8c8d.jpg""> She was staring off when he looked back, and she immedaitly straightened her shoulders and smiled back, hopefully showing before he had turned back. After he started walking again she sighed and slumped her shoulders, moving her ears off her head. She turned and started towards the hallway to take the stairs back upstairs, mentally berating herself the whole time."

<u><b>GOOD</u></b>
Right, so congratulations are in order! Happy Birthday, Bridget! (Me!) Am 18 now...perfectly legal to celebrate in <i>proper</i> manner that is becoming a Lady Witch like me! Now can drink wine and gap at perfectly handsome Mr. Darcy Professor from affar and know am perfectly allowed to. Wonder what he looks like in wet shirt....mmmmm....

Had a <i>lovely</i> walk yesterday, accomapnied by one <strike>handsome and suave sophisticated Man about Town</strike> Mr. Amos Doggory...Hufflepuff...He's one of those Quidditch players. Bloody Brilliant on the game, though. But his team didn't win, did they? That's awfully shitty.....really. Not sure what to think on that. Perhaps he will become Famous Sportsman and will kindly remember Plain Bridget Jones and bestow upon her glamourous interview for when become Star Television Journalist.

Wait...only muggles use the tele. Bloody Bugger.

<strike> Still, one finds oneself quite smitten by one such soon-to-be-World-famous-Quidditch-Player</strike>


<b>7:00 pm</b>
<b><u>BAD</b></u>
Although I broke it off with Avery a year ago, he still seems to fancy me...or maybe just my skirt. He came round to bother me, by means of private IMs in Journaling system. I mean, what is he on? What makes him think I will just drop everything and come running to his beck and call?? I'm NOT just a plaything, a passing glance, a temporary resolution to a long term problem! I'm a human being, for crying out loud, and i dare say a good one at that! Said he saw me and Amos walking, but that's all we were doing, honestly! Walking! Of course he (Amos) told me a few things...like how I allow everyone's opnion of me to dictate my life...(they do not!)...and how he kept thinking he did things ot get me upset (when it was my own stupid anctics that did it honestly...I mean...Pollen down my blouse...it itches!) I really think Amos is a great guy....really really do....v. handsome. v. polite....v. proper.....v. charming.....v. atheletic....

<b>7:30 pm</b> v. good hair...mmmmm...

<b>7:32 pm</b> v. good proportions...striking resemblence in character to Mr. Darcy from Pride and Predjudice...however Professor Bullas has striking physical similarities, plus one thinks he might look <i>very</i> good in wet t-shirt.

<b>7:35 pm</b> Wonder if Amos is seeing anyone.

<b>7:36 pm</b> Wonder if I can be Wantton Sex Godess and get Mr. Darcy look-a-like to have and to hold. 


<b>7:40 pm</b> Mmmm....


<b>7:50 pm</b> Must stop day dreaming, really.


<b>8:00 pm</b> No, just a minute more, then will get on with homework.

<b>10:00 pm</b> BUGGER! Must really do homework now! have 8 am class!

"event","<i><small>128 lbs. (guessing), number of Chocolate frogs consumed 0 (v. v. good), number of usable quills 1, number of broken quills 6, number of times panicked 5,000 (v. bad)</i>

<b>6 a.m.</b> Dorm. Woke up to strange noises. Noises sounded like odd furry creature gnawing and chewing. Maybe is gerbil, or rat. Maybe is garden gnome. Will hope is only a bad dream or hallucination and go back to sleep.

<b>6:10 a.m.</b> Noise just got louder! Will keep pillow over head.

<b>6:13 a.m.</b> Oh Merlin! Can't sleep with noise! Sounds like two stones rubbing against sandpaper. Had idea it might be rather large rat.

<b>6:14 a.m.</b> Maybe a really really large rat.

<b>6:15 a.m.</b> Bugger! Have to piss. 

<b>6:16 a.m.</b> Don't want to leave safety of bed. Might get consumed by rather abnormally large rat monster under bed. 

<b>6:17 a.m.</b> Bladder hurts. Not v. good. Must consume fear of monster rat and make for the loo.

<b>6:20 a.m.</b> Right. Here I go.

<b>6:45 a.m.</b> GAH! Who took all the toilet paper??? That was not fun.

<b>6:47 a.m.</b> Sounds gone. Will go back to sleep.

<b>7:01 a.m.</b> NO! Its back, and much louder-WHAT WAS THAT NOISE???

<b>7:30 a.m.</b> Discovered not rat but cat under bed. It jumped up on my bed, and gave me quite a scare. Discovered was not cat out of hell but Kingsley's Precious. Have just returned her to top of stairs of boys' dorms. Now to go back to sleep.

<b>7:33 a.m.</b> Bugger! Breakfast!"

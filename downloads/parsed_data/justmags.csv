"event","Upon further reflection on the possibility of getting a visa and being in Indonesia for the 25th, I have realized that its practically impossible.
So, I've requested that instead of spending 2 months there this year, that I go next year after I graduate and spend 4 months to a year there, and instead of flying out to Indonesia this Sunday, I'm flying out to California.
I'm going to spend a couple days in LA and a couple in Santa Barbara with my aunt and uncle.
I also have a job interview next Friday, so I&nbsp;guess things are all working out."

"event","I got the internship in Indonesia! 
They want me there before the 25th of June (which is coming up soon!), and I&nbsp;just found out last week. 
I&nbsp;have so much to do to prepare... today, I shopped around for flights with my dad, and hopefully he'll come up with an itinerary soon. (My dad works with an airline and [luckily] is able to get me flights for soooo much cheaper than if I jsut went to a travel agent.)&nbsp; 
2 months in Indonesia! I&nbsp;can't believe it. I'm excited and so nervous as well. 
I mean after spending 3 months in Brazil and a total of 6 months away last year (I&nbsp;actually left almost exactly&nbsp;one year ago...) 2 months doesn't seem like very long. The only thing is that this time I am going to be there completely alone! 
In Brazil I was with a group of people, all of whom, even though I&nbsp;didn't know&nbsp; any of them before going, were pretty much going through the same thing as I was and I&nbsp;was able to bond with them over our problems. 
This time there is no program, just work at a school, and I'll be left to my own devices trying to entertain myself. 
Scary! 
I hope I have money when I&nbsp;get back... 
augh I am never going to move out."

Wear it.&quot; It was way too windy for an umbrella, so i figured why not, since I'll be needing to stand outside to wait for the streetcar anyways. Upon seeing it, Rafay decided that he was not dressed appropriately for the weather, so we went to dollarama to pick up a super stylish sheet of yellow plastic fashioned into a poncho. This poncho then proceeded to help him get hit on by two old portuguese men pulling garbage bags over their heads&nbsp;outside college station. <br />Man: &quot;Dahhling, where did you get that? It's yellow, and so much cuter than what we have!&quot;<br />Rafay: &quot;Dollarama&quot;<br />Man: &quot;But it's cloooooooosedd!&quot;<br />Other man: &quot;Ohhh your shoes, they are soo pretty! Where are they from?&quot;<br />Amazing.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","after 3 months in brazil, 3 months in quebec, and 2 days hostelling in montreal, im finally home.
i hate it here, more than ever.
the hostel that we stayed at before being turned loose by jeunesse canada monde felt more home-like to me that the house that i returned to.
the last couple months have been life-changing. and the last couple of days have been draining.
its hard to say goodbye to the 7 other people with whoom youve shared your life with for the past 6 months. they were everything that was familiar to me while we were in brazil and after when we came back to quebec. we became a family, which is incredibly amazing considering i didnt know any of them 6 months ago.
i love them all, and i miss them already. 
ive been crying on and off all day - which i actually find incredilbly stupid... but uncontrollable.
i cant believe i just got home... and cant wait to leave again.

im going to dinner with some friends to catch up tonight - hopefully i dont start crying... again..."

"event","im no longer in brazil.
after spending 3 months in a small town in the south of brazil, i've finally returned to canada.
the second phase of the program has begun, and im now living with yet another host family, but this time in salaberry-de-valleyfield, Quebec.
I've painted schools for children with special needs, i've planted grass in a field at a school for the children of those involved with movement for more just agrarian reform, i've planted trees along a river bank, i've &quot;integrated&quot; with the community, I've learned how to dance traditional ga&uacute;cho dances, and i've eaten enough churrasco to last me a lifetime. 
i've also drank more than i ever have in my life.

so here's to brazil, and a good 1st phase of the program. i'm 2 weeks into the 2nd phase and although it hasn't been great, here's to hoping that there'll at least be as much drinking as there was in brazil.
cheers"

i flew halfway around the world.

i was in singapore for the last week.
i came back on sunday.
i slept all day monday, catching up on sleep that i missed out on during the 21 hour flight back to toronto, woke up at 5pm and started on the homework that i had neglected while enjoying the amazing weather.
i got zero sleep all night, have a presentation this afternoon, and am trying to deal with the severe climate change from going from the tropics to the cold harsh canadian winter.
i wish the week lasted longer!

i'll post pictures soon, i promise."

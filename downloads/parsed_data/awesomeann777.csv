"event","For some time now my Mom and I live next door to one side playing loud noisy music with live real instruments I think from what it sounds like.  
I wish the landlords would do something about it!  I talked w/ another neighbor and they told her to just call the police as they won't do a thing about it! It happens every other day every couple of hours.
Another side of us is a total ""potty-mouth"" every day he yells outside loud enough for us to hear offensive language!  I think he needs REAL help w/ his mental problems!

I wish I could move out to OC to get nearer to Disneyland, they're the main reasons I go to Disney parks very often."

"event","A week before this, I took some negatives from the disney annual passport group meets along w/ a few more to a Ritz Camera in Montclair Plaza to get into my Cd.  I got the original copies of the Splash Mountain photos in to get it into a floppy disc.  I first paid the $55.00 by card and then paid my $15.00 for the pictures into a floppy disc. 
I went and got the Cd back from the shop and later I went to the new Elphant Bar restaurant while waiting for the next bus. I ordered just the baked potato skins w/ cheese, bacon, and sour cream; which was very good:)!  
When I got home, I finally got a few of the pictures including the Splash Mountain pics into the group photo album (w/ permission from a couple people though).  
I'm hoping to go somewhere to get my old 110 film negatives into a Cd so I can put some older pictures of me in my little ""starter"" free geocities.com website."

"event","First place we went to is I-HOP on Euclid in Upland.  He ordered a Country Omolette and I ordered the Passport Breakfast w/ Buttermilk Pancakes.  We enjoyed it. This is the 2nd straight week we went there for breakfast.  Last time he ordered the Swedish Passport Breakfast and I ordered the same but also Buttermilk w/ added hash browns.  
(A week before that we went to Denny's, it was nice, he ordered All American Slam and I ordered Bacon Cheeseburger combo.)
Max and I went and saw ""Undercover Brother"" at Edwards Theater by the 10 freeway and wasn't crowded at all.  I liked the movie pretty much but not worth paying full price for the movie when it comes out VH-S.
Then Max and I went to see a dog he wants to buy from a private sell out of the newspaper ad.  The little puppy is mixed breed but don't know the exact one and he paid $225.00 for it though she asked for a little more than that.  I held on to her while he drove me to my work.  I just made it there ontime to close that night w/ Donna.  
I've NOT seen him since:(!"

He looked at my Yahoo profile as disneyfreak777 while playing but I kept on telling him how my hair is much shorter since this photo is taken!  He asked me to meet him at Ontario Mills in front of Gameworks at 1:00pm and I agreed.
He was waiting for me w/ his cell phone!  The first words he said was ""You're shorter than I thought!""  We went to Virgin Megastore to kill time before we went to the movies which is AMC at 2:00pm to see ""Panic Room""--good movie but alot of F@@@ words said and some violence like the rating system said!  There was even a lady who brought her 3 year old inside; which she yelled most of the movie!  
Later we went to my work at A&W to show him around Ontario and he was impressed w/ the root-beer made there and bought a mug.
We went to Edwards for another movie at 5:30pm to see ""Disney's The Rookie.""  A true story and very good family movie!  I'd like to buy actually both videos when it comes out!  Both movies were very good!  
We then went to Vince's on Holt to show him my favorite place for spaghetti.  We ordered meat sauce and cheese bread.  He said he was very impressed with it.
Then he took me home!  Nice and busy day for me on my day off at work!
I can't wait and see what my friends/co-workers feel about us tomorrow morning!
He seems to like me and I like him already so far.  He understand Spanish, goes to Disney resort 3-4 times a year (but not an AP), and likes variety of music mostly Country though.
We have our cell phone numbers and hope we'll see each other again online and in person!"

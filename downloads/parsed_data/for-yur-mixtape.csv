just got home from michelle's & taking jerm to work. god i love him. we've been picking on eachother too much lately, im kind of excited to start work so that the picking stops. ya know? i mean i see him everynight. everyday. sometimes twice a day at diff. times. and it leaves no time to miss him.. and maybe thats what i need. i dont know. but i love him SO fucking much, but we both getmoody sometimes which results in bickering. but hey, thats natural right?

anyWAY.. jeremy's family is in town. theyre so.. nice. i love his little cousin raychelle. she calls herself my sister, and nikki tells everyone im her sister in law. how cute is that.

OMFG.  i am buying roller skates. ive been rollerblading with nikki alot lately, lol and jeremy & brandon following us on their skate boards and its so much fucking fun. so ive decided that im getting the hot pink skechers rollerSKATES .. just to be old school. oh yeah.


so i really love my hair. i think it lightens up face.. and it really makes my tan noticable which is totally awesome. so yeah. i need to study, ands do my study guide for lit. yeah but im lazy.. and i feel like im going to take a NAP! hooray for me.

alright. this is enough. the most ive updated in like. a year.
kbye"

dear mommy, 
i miss you so much you couldnt and wouldnt believe it. every night i fall asleep and awake with the thought and image of you in my head, and your nightgown wrapped tightly in my fist. i love you forever, and fucking always. 
<3 love,
your daughter


365 days ago.
exactly one year ago.
my life as well as hers came to an end.




heres the entry i wrote from last year, this exact day, after she died;

5:45am. my life as well as hers is over. my heart is gone. my soul is torn away. i cant explain how this feels. if i could take my emotional pain away and be with her i would. i cant stand it. she died. gone. in the blink of an eye. we got a call. confirmation. we went down there. oh god. going in that fucking room hurt like hell. holding her lifeless stiff hand feeling no pulse and no response. hurt like hell.kissing her breathless lips hurt like hell. feeling her cold clamy skin hurt like hell. not seeing her chest rise and fall. hurt like hell. saying goodbye for the very last time hurt like hell. the pain is immeasurable you guys could never imagine. picking out a fucking urn for your own mother is fucking horrible. i swear if my life gets any worse im going to go insane. what am i talking about? i probaly already am insane. all this.. has offically made me; insane. for ever and day ill love and miss her. nothing left to loose here i live my life to the best of my ability. sincere; goodbye.

WHEW. so yeah. jeremy needs to hurry up now. 

omfg.  i loveeeeeeee my new eyebrows. theyre so sexy.
i like them cause theyre still skinny, but fuller, and now i use powder so it looks more natural, and they are thicker in the front of it and then get skinnier at the end and arch up. yeah , i posted a pic down there but you cant really see it that well.
Mhmm.

20$ to get my upperlip waxed and my eyebrows shaped&waxed. best 20 dollars ive spent in a LONNGG time. yes.

i seriously love jeremy

OH YEAH. he almost got an apartment but it was hella ghetto and yeah. i told him i'd be scared to go see him  and  yeah so he said no. and now hes going to finish his classes, and get a new job. and then like hella save. cause its hard to save alot of money now working at the job he has now.

news flash, melissa: 
youre absent too much.
..but its okay, today, cause you have a valid excuse.
just dont let it happen again.
have a nice day. 
sincere, the voice inside your head.


so, im taking up painting. 
im not quite sure how to do so, or how to start.. so i guess im just going to wing it 
until HOPEFULLY i get painting 1 next year.

yeah, i picked my classes. ill have 4 classes (most likely)

me and jeremy just got done watching the movie ""wrong turn"".
its good, scary, but good.
completely predictable though, me and jerm knew the movie ending with only seeing it halfway through.


hm, my dads playing poker right now. i hope hes winning.

im getting tan. that makes me happy.

this is what i got jeremy for valentines day. inside the pink wrapping is 5 boxes of 2.lbs of hot tamales, and inside the bag is 2 books hes been wanting.

<img src=http://img15.photobucket.com/albums/v45/foryurmixtape/DSC00966.jpg>
& those are cookie cakes.

<img src=http://img15.photobucket.com/albums/v45/foryurmixtape/DSC00965.jpg>
and yeah, thats a giant card. im cool. the end.


soo i have to get a ct scan on march 8. wish me luck.
hope fully nothing will be wrong with me.. hopefully.

i'll leave you with a few pictures, that i dont like too much,
i look gross and thats that.
and im lazy and dont want to do a cut. but i guess i will anyways cause im cool.

<lj-cut text=""yeah, click this shit biatch"">

just got home from seeing jeremy on his lunch and shopping with fath.. (the .. other .. one).. 
yeah, it was alright.
me and jeremy had fun. he drove my in my car caus ei just think thats so grand.

..........i miss sara.
i wish things never happen the way they did, but i duno, ive said sorry.

it just hurts cause everytime i tell a story it includes her, and now shes like in none of the stories im like.. ""creating"" anymore.
its sad that me and her, being friends BEST friends, SISTERS. for 3 years, let something so dumb tear us apart.
yeah, we were both upset. but we let our little emotions,jeremy and fucking faith get inbetween us.
i say if me aand her can still be friends this thing will make us stronger.

but its fucked up the way everytone thinks i said all this shit that i never even said. i never said sara slept around. why the hell would i say thaT? she doesnt. i said shit about faith that i shouldnt have, and ive only ever said liek one freakin thing about sara and thats the one thing that gets pushed around. that i said she was a butter face or whatever, when after i said that faith fucking agreed ewith me cause she was the one pissed off about how sara gets everyone's boys (which she does cause sara was always the prettiest out of all our friends.. including me.. she always got all my boys too) but faith was fuckin saying the same shit. but see. no one cares about that.. nopeeee . cause I said it.
e;krfjsdkfj  gay.
i duno im like done with it. but still, having things float around and peopel hate me for shit i never did is gay.

sd;kjhdkjfhds
damnitmy momwould slap me right now if she could i bet.
i let stupid shit get in the way of sisterhood"

ive ever had in my life 
today in 5&6th&after school.
i cried,i threw up, i cried some more, 
and then i fell asleep on the downstairs bathroom floor, 
where jeremy then walked into my house
 and saw me and thought ""what the fuck?""
yeah, then i cried just a tiddly bit more on his shoulder
cause i told him i puked and no one was there to help me.
i was sad. but i got over it, fast.

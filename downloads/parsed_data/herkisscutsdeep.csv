"event","Well last night (Sunday) I went to my aunt's for dinner. and when i got home, it started to snow, and snow, and snow. It was like 11 at night and still snowing. My mom went to bed cuz she thought she may have had work but I knew there wasn't going to be any school. 

So I woke up and talked to Kelli cuz we had talked about going sledding. I shoveled to get my car out and me and my mom went to Wawa so I could get gas, then to Wal-Mart. Not gonna lie, the roads were really shitty. So I get home and I ask Hilary and Jenna if they wanted to come cuz Jenna said she did the night before. But they couldn't come. I really wanted to hang out with em, but they were tired, so maybe next time =/

Anyways, it was pretty bad ass. It ended up being me, Chris Lewis, Chris Barnhouser, Kelli, and Brittany (but Brittany didn't feel good and went home like an hour after we left), so esentially, just us 4. We started off going to Arundel to check out this hill. SUCKED. So we went to this park GORC for it's hill. SUCKED. So eventually I said were going back to Vo-Tech, cuz I was driving them all, so we did. It was pretty tight. So we sledded some, there was alot of people. Then me and Kelli drove to her house real quick (and dropped Brit off). We got rope at Kelli's and drove back to Vo-Tech.

So we take the rope and tie it to a metal ring in my trunk and use our sleds and tubes. We were dragging each other around on the car it was pretty bad ass, and scary, at first. Even Barnhouser did it :p  Then as it got darker, me and Chris L. got stupider. So we used the boogy board time thing and we would start at halfway down the side street of Spalding and floor it hittin like 30 - 40 mph. Then whoever was drivin the other (Me or Chris) would slide out to the right and the person on the rope on the back let go of the rope and would fly up and hit this jump. It was pretty gnarly, kinda hard to explain but I have movies if I can find a way to put them up on here. It was pretty nice. Chris B. didn't wanna do it cuz he didn't wanna get hurt for lacrosse, I don't blame him. Kelli's jus Kelli so yea.

So then Mike, Brittany M., Billy, and Stephanie saw us in St. Bernadette's and Mike dropped by. We talked some and shit and he did donuts in the truck and he left. I took both Chris's and Kelli home and then went home and ate dinner. It was a good day. Now I am jus sittin here freezin cuz I got out of the shower, and I don't really dry alot, I dunno why, it's weird hah.

So we have off tomorrow and it should be tight. I am trying to find something to do so if anyone wants to hang out give me a call. 

---------<>---------<>---------<>---------<>---------<>---------

A star up in the sky goes slowly passing by,
The lights below...they spell out your name.
You're comfort on my mind and you're with me all the time.
And lot's of feeling that I can't explain.

I won't spend another night alone.

Out of every girl I meet, no other can compete
I'd ditch em all for a night with you.
I know you don't believe you mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do.



I couldn't think of anything to write again, my heads mush cuz I am cold. =/"

"event","Why doesen't anyone post in my journal. Not that I am really complaining cuz I would proabably only get made fun of, it just seemed the cool thing to do. HAH. Anyways. Some stuff has happened. I am not sure where I left off at so I will start with Thursday.

Nothing really exciting, I was kinda sick with sinuses and stuff so I took some Nyquill the night before and had trouble waking up in the morning due to that so I jus slept in til 10 and then went to school. Nothing really exciting.

Friday was boring for school to. At work I found out theres somebody else thats gonna be working in my group starting Monday so I guess I will see how that goes, should be interesting. Friday night was pretty awesome. So I went back to Woods. Yea wouldn't expect it but to tell you the truth I was impressed. It got alot better, just vibes and everything. This side project played that was Tobias, Dan, Kevin, Chris, and Tim. They were pretty amazing, they seem to be good at whatever they do which is just pure talent. I think it's in their blood or something. The other bands were alright. Me, Weibe, and Chris went out earlier, that was interesting. Jenna and Hillary were there in and out, I don't kno where they went, wanted to hang out with em more but I couldn't do much. I had to take Kelli and Brit home so we left at like 11:30 and the snow was pouring down and sticking to the roads so I drove home slowly. We decided to stop at 7-11, got some food and I took them both to Kelli's house. Then I came home, talked on the net some and fell asleep on the couch watching TV.

Saturday I woke up cuz I think my mom was making coffee or someting in the kitchen. I had already finished the laundry and shit that I wanted to. So I jus kinda sat on the couch all day, I felt lazy, not like there was anything else to do. At like 4:30 Chris came over, then we picked up Kelli and Brit cuz they live so close to me, and NEITHER of them have there licenses even tho they BOTH should. Sad... Anyways. We got them and headed down to Maryland Hall for Battle of the Bands. It was pretty awesome. I saw alot of people I  haven't seen in awhile so that was cool. Brings back memories, *tear*, jus kidding. I thought Avenli did pretty bad ass to them, they rocked. Tommy got best drummer, that kid deserves it he's pretty amazing. Saw Nick, Kellys ex. He's cool. Hilary and Jenna rolled up. Got to hang out with Jenna a little bit so that made my day.   

But what was hilarious, Hilary flashed a 12 and 13 yeard old for 3 bucks, a sticker, and a pin. Now THAT made their day. ( I just thought that was worthy enough to be put by itself).

We left at like 11:20, stopped at Wendy's for Chris, Brit, and Kelli, and then I took them all home. The night made me happy for my reasons. Anyways, thats about it up til now.

I am supposed to go to the car show with my dad tomorrow, we will see how that goes.

I listened to Good Charlotte on the way home. Hah, make fun of it all you want, I like their songs, they as people were mean to me though a few times =/ So...

I am lost and see-through
I think you've lost yourself to
Throughout all of this confusion
I hope I somehow get to you

I practiced all the things I'd say
To tell you how i feel
And when i finally get my chance
It all seems so surreal

Cause from the first time i saw you
I only thought about you.
I didnt know you
I wanted to hold onto
The things youd never say to me
Cause you said

You can't change the way you feel
but you cant tell me this aint real, cause this is real
And In the end its all ive got (so I'm gonna hold onto that)
So im gunna hold
On and on and on 

And now you've got me watchin your eyes
You got me waitin just to see
Your eyes are watchin me.

Oh, and now youve got me thinkin bout
the first time that i met you
Standing in a crowded room
But i could only see you
And i hope my words will get through
Cause now i cant forget you
I want to tell you
If only i could reach you
And make you feel this way
But you said

You can't change the way you feel
But you can't tell me this aint real, cause this is real
And In the end its all ive got
So im gunna hold ont to that, so I'm gonna hold
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

"event","Well today really really sucked. I woke up and didn't feel good. Like nothing serious just a sinus infection I think. But I had to wake up early and go back to school which just isn't working for me. So my classes are all switched around because it's second semester. That sucks more too because I don't have lunch with any of my friends besides like Kriz. Which no he isn't bad heh, it's just I did have alot more friends in my other lunch.<br><br>

So Junior ring is this Saturday but since I don't have a date, and I can't really dance well, I kinda ruled it out. Instead I think I am just going to go to see AA Battle of the Bands at Maryland Hall. Avenli's playing and I am friends with all of them so I figure I will go and support them and hopefully see people I know otherwise I will sit in the corner all night =/ ...<br><br>

Friday I don't have any plans what-so-ever so I think I will just go up to Wood's. Apparently there is some thing with Kevin, Tobias, and Chris (Previous BIA) and some guy Tim (?). But yea there little group thing and I have always been a fan of there music so I guess I will check them out. I doubt anyone I kno will be there but it's cool I guess it is better then sitting around moping at night.<br><br> 

I still have been depressed ever since the shit I previously wrote but I guess I will just see if it gets any better through out the week. I hope it does but stuff like this doesen't usually go easy on me. It was a big deal to me even though nothing theoretically "" went wrong "", it went completely right, but the aftermath sucks. But still it would be hard for anyone else besides me to understand.<br><br> 

O, another thing, work still sucks, because it's work. But on the way home whenever I drive and especially when I brake, there is this loud ass like grinding sound. And It's been doing it for like 3 days now and my engine makes a weird sound so I called my dad and he told me to drop it off at this guys garage. So I did that at like 7 tonight and my mom brought me. So now I am stuck with the fucking corvette. Don't get me wrong its a bad ass car for summer, but winter NO. No defroster in the morning, no heat, small room, fucking cold, rear wheel drive, back heavy. Just about everything going against me that could be. So if I don't die I will be lucky. Sounds like I need a new car huh?<br><br>

It was cool that I read Kriz's diary today and jus found that he has alotta the same feelings that I do. I just thought it was weird because I didn't expect that, but it's cool cuz I am friends with him. I should start hanging out more with him.<br><br> 

Anyways, I still have homework. So fuck this shit, I guess I will talk later. Bye.<br><br><br>


Some people hide behind a mask that they call fact. Why would I bring my problems to you when it hurts so bad. So let me tell you heres the plan. I will buy a broken down car and we will get outta here. They say the stars shine the brightest where noone else is. I tell them that my star shines brightest when she smiles. One kiss is all it takes, to take down a man with a boyish grin. He never grows up, she never gets old, the story repeats, letters unfold. Time takes a toll, but the story never gets old. The toll to pay for trying to love, is death, or so it seems. This time we can try harder, this time we will unite darling."

I duno, not alot has been going on. Friday i can't even remember what I did, I don't know why. Saturday night I can't remember either. Sunday night was interesting. I was with Chris and we jus drove around all night but we were supposed to go over Grace's grandmothers. So we get over there and call and they kept blowing us off and shit. And then like a drunk guy would pick up the phone and say all this shit to us. So that wasn't cool because we were worried, I mean like 2 girls and 4 drunk guys, I don't know. So like we keep callin all night and we told the guys to come outside and say shit to us but they wouldn't. So we called up Bobby and Mike and Jimmy and like 4 other guys came up. So it was like 9 guys at 1230 at night outsides Grace's grandmothers. And the guys still wouldn't come out but Brittany went home with Bobby and it was jus alotta drama and shit but I in the long run was only looking out for them cuz I kno how drunk guys can be. So then Chris B. was awesome and let us come back to his house to sleep cuz we shouldn't been out that late so yea. Thanks Chris.

Have you ever felt like you just need someone? Like theres a certain person, that all you want to do is just be with them. That no words need to be spoken, no actions provoked. Just to lay down or sit down with your arms around them. To take in the moment like it won't ever end. You jus lay forever. Time has no significance, voices aren't heard. Yea well, I do.

Today (Monday) me and Chris L. woke up and we went home. I got lunch for my mom and ate with her, took a shower, and Chris came to get me again and we went to Jenna's. It was Hil and Jenna and that was really cool, I was just tired. Sowwie =/ . Hillary was definately interesting though hah. I had alot of fun though for reasons that only me will proabably ever know or say but when we left it all ended and I got into an emo mood. Errr... Yea... So then we went to Bill Batemens with Ryan, Chris B., Jen, Jess, Collin, Alex, Ben, Dan, and Lynzie. That was ok. Wings were good. Then Dan took me to guitar cuz I still didn't have my car at this point, Thanks Dan. Then Chris L., picked me up and took me home, again, Thanks. And I am here now writing this.

After today I have decided I don't really want to just ' hook up ' with anyone anymore. Yea you find some people attractive and stuff, and yea its high school and you should ' do shit because you'll looked back in life and wish you did ' and all but err. Hooking up is ok, not that I was ever some huge player but sometimes it hurts alot too. No nothing happened at Jenna's, I don't want anyone to read this thinking that for her sake. But shit just made me realize that if I can't be with someone that I really like and enjoy being around alot then I shouldn't be hooking up with them and definately not with anyone else for that matter because as stupid and lame as it sounds, I can't really handle it. I wan't to be with someone that I like and love being around. And it never works when I try, and I don't try often because I usually only try with people that are special which has been like 3 in a  year MAYBE. Errr. That sounds really lame but it's hard for me to put this all how I want to. I guess I just hope that someone turns around, even though they proabably don't even know who they are.

So yea, now that that is out for my own sake on here. I am not in a really good mood right now soo. 


Heart turns to concrete and blood turns to stone. I didn't think it would hurt so bad for a one minute hug alone. The time felt good and the scene was right but how do you go on knowing it's going to be gone. How do you grasp a feeling thats to strong to let anyone else feel or hold on. It's not a fucking ride, it's a request and a promise. I said I would hold on and do anything I could. But all you could promise was a steady killship. I don't know what to tell you, I couldn't tell you what to say when she said, It's over, your cut. I don't think it would work out. But how can comeone be so contradicting to never try or give up a fight. To break down the walls and let someone else besides yourself in. Lock and key baby, I can see it in your eyes that you want to care but are to scared to hold on. Life treats you bad enough but I won't. I know that you have dated other guys, but sometimes I jus sit in my room on the bedside, and I contemplate to cry, wonder why, you'd leave it out for me."

"event","Well, not much happening lately. I haven't updated in awhile cuz I have been really busy. Midterms are this week. Today I took the English and Religion exams. They were pretty rough in some parts, easy in others. The problem is that it's just so much information that you just can't even fit it all in.

I don't think mid-terms or like SAT's should even be allowed. They are jus tests and some people just suck at tests like me. It shouldn't be a reflection of how much you kno jus because your good at multiple choice. Anyways.. Chris B. and Kelli came over Monday night and we ordered chineese food and studied shit. Chris left and me and kelli studied religion then I took her home. Tonight I jus dropped by Chris B.'s to study a little bit and try to get some shit taken care of. Tomorrow (Wednesday) I only have a Physics exam because I am done with my foreign languages so that kicks ass.

The downside is that I have to go to work earlier. Well no, tomorrow I don't go in til 330 but the other days I go in at like 1130. But at least I get more hours in towards my car.

I think I have narrowed my car down to an Eclipse model. I wanna either get a 2000 + GT or a 1997 GSX / GS-T. I dunno yet, it all depends on the condition and shit. But I am really pumped up about that because I plan to have it with a few mod's by the end of summer, it'll kick ass, iam siked. 

I may go to Kelly's house Friday. She lives over the bridge. It's just kinda weird cuz I told her I liked her awhile ago and she said the same but like she hangs out with all these different guys and apparently wanted to get with this one kid on new years eve at Chris's. But it's her life so I am not gonna get into it. Basically it just won't work like every other relationship I try. 

I might try to hang out with Chelsea this weekend to. She's really cool but I think shes annoyed with me right now or something anyways. 

Well I gotta go study more for Physics.

I have been trying to write little songs and shit I have at the end up each of my journal entries like the ones previously. Sometimes it may not have it, but it's jus lil writings I have, they kinda suck Hah but o well, don't read em.

Gnight.


Will of trife and contemplate. Inside out's and blackout sins. This was the night all the stars came crashing down. I never said I wanted it to hurt. Breakout bays and sorrow songs. Take out tables and morning doves. Love is at it's peak. Sitting on the sunny mountain. Talking through unspoken silence. Morning dew and setting sun. Try to think back of how it was."

"event","Well. Today was an ok day. I had to wake up at 9 and me, my brother, mom, craig, JD, and Jeff cleaned out my whole basement. It was amazingly cold this morning. We moved all the shit to the top of the hill and my mom's gonna sort it out there and we made like 2 dump runs. To give an idea of how much shit there was, it took from 9 - 3 in the afternoon. Sucked. Kelly asked me to hang out and I really wanted to but I couldn't get done until like 3 and she had to leave to go home at 5:15 so I guess she couldn't really do much. So that sucked. :(   So after calling her on the phone, I fell asleep on my bed. I hate falling asleep in the middle of the day because I feel like I am wasting my day away when I could be doing so much more.

So I woke up at like 6 and took a shower, I called Chris cuz he was supposed to have people over. It was like Dan and Lisa and me. So I went over there and we pretty much ended up watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, amazing movie still. 

Speaking of I should hopefully have my Eclipse this summer. Either a 97 GSX or a 2000+ GT. But I will hold my breath because whenever I think I am close to gettin a car it blows up in my face. My dad is basically helpin me pay for like half of it but thats better then nothing. It's just aggravating seein all these kids as Spalding gettin brand new or decent used cars. Anyways, no biggie. The point is, I should get my car this summer and I plan to modify the FUCK out of that car. It'll be hott. 



Angelic eyes and strawberry lips. Smooth legs and fragrant kisses. She says I will have to wait it might be a little hard to take in the taste this time. She says I am just trying to get a feel for what I think is right. I don't know what to do or what to say, but believe me I believe in you all the way. Follow the stars to guide your heart, is it worse to die or to be alive. This was just a dream or so it seems. When she said take my hand and never look back, she gave a sweet kiss, a promise of infinity. His head was held down, at a loss for words, he prayed that the promise, never be gone.

"event","<P>Today was just like any other day, wake up, go to school, work, come home, eat, homework, sleep. The shitty routine I wish I could just end.</P>
<P>On another note I am looking for another job. I applied at least 20 places and apparently noone wants me so I am going to try applying this weekend for a bus boy job at Ruby Tuesday's or something like that. I just need more money because I am trying to work really hard to buy myself a new / used car. It seems like I will never get there and that it's pointless sometimes but I guess I will keep saving. I want to get an Eclipse I am almost 99% sure but I guess we will see. </P>
<P>Chris's little happening is this weekend. For him and Dan's birthday. That's cool, I hope it turns out good for them. I think I am going. But usually at shit with alot of people I just mope, yea it's pathetic I know, but I guess I just don't like seeing so many people so happy at once, which I guess is really pathetic and ignorant, I wish I didn't feel that way but sometimes I do.</P>
<P>I have also been trying to write more, nothing like deep or inspirational. Just to write how I feel, only like little stuff. I don't know. </P>
<P>You ever feel like a fuck up at times? You feel like your on a winning triumphant streak and then shit just flies. You feel like the walls are closing and your not doing a thing right in the world. Well it happens, but shit happens right?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your eyes are shut tight and no light is getting in. Wounds won't fade in time and scars have no room to breathe. Silent whispers in dark rooms, the door shuts and the beds left empty. This hospitals getting really cold, I hate being here without you. The last time I was in wasn't for a regular check up.&nbsp;I hear the canvas was painted with blood and gun shot remnants. Or maybe the rope samples didn't come back from the lab yet. Baby I don't know what to tell you. I say "" I'm sorry"" and you say ""We're through"". This isn't some sick twisted fucking game. Let me tell you the last time I heard your call. My heart stopped and my blood boiled. The last thing I know I see bright lights and surgical equipment. The flowers in my room have wilted away, but what do you expect from a half ended relationship. If I am gone, because it may come to the point, pull the IV's out and say goodbye. Kiss me hard, don't let me go, I wished I had re-thought the way to go. Now the house is haunted, my rooms boarded up. They can't pass by without giving a sob. It turned out as a Bloody Boy Martyr dying for the only girl he ever thought he could believe in.</P>

"event","<P>Ok, first off all, I kno this sounds like everyone else, but if you really just have negative things to say about what I write or just are going to laugh at everything, just please don't look at it. Thanks. </P>
<P>I was listening to the Starting Line CD and it made me think about alot of things.</P>
<P>One was my friends and family, I know they care sometimes, and thats natural but alot of other times its hard for me to tell. I guess alot of people feel all of these things I feel, I don't know, I feel left alone in the world sometimes, like people just don't care. I guess the world is a cold place. I don't know.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth, I do miss my dad, not now, but what he used to be.&nbsp;I look back in pictures and I miss his smile that was once on his face. I miss days when we talked, and hung out. Things always change. But how can someone who cares so much supposedly just up and leave, and tell me he knows I do not understand why?</P>
<P>I don't really have any chances with alot of girls anymore either. Hook ups are fun and what highschool kid wouldn't want them, but sometimes I want to just sit down and settle. No I don't mean I want to get married but I want someone I can really care about. I kno people say you will find the right girl and that the right time will come, and I guess in some ways I believe that. The problem is that I don't expect to find my life parterner in highschool, but I do expect to find someone. How do I know what I want if noone will even give me the chance to find out? I don't understand. Yea, I want a sweet, cute, trusthworthy, hot, loving, caring, honest, good humor and good personality girl, who doesen't.I have things I can only dream up in my head that I could do&nbsp;for them, the nicest and&nbsp;sweetest things. I am sure everyone feels that but I wish&nbsp;I had someone to express it too.&nbsp;But I want one thats right for me. I don't know. Maybe I am too picky I don't know. </P>
<P>I am not in the best of moods right now you can tell. I notice that alot of times when I am not in good moods its when I am alone, and by myself.&nbsp;I start to think about things from the past, and what will happen in the future. Do people care or do they just pretend for their own sake?</P>
<P>I try not to worry about a bunch of big issues today. I do believein God and believe that he has a defined plan but that we are only humans with free choice and freedom. So human error is included in the equation for life, thats natural, noone is a scapegoat, mistakes happen. </P>
<P>I think not to be conceeded but that I have alot of insight for being only 16. I work at childcare where I am the youngest and majority are over 20 and all girls. Sometimes I talk with one of them at a time and the talks mean alot. It's not about me or them really, just in general, about things. It feels good to talk to someone on the same level I am. Sometimes family and teachers and shit just don't work. Its jus refreshing to hear and talk to them. They aren't the smartest people but they know alot then other people. They have been through it and have a better understanding. I don't know.</P>
<P><STRONG>Somtimes I think and try to envision what life would be life if I was not here. Would it change?</STRONG></P>

<P>Hey girl, look back and spread your wings, this will be harder then you think. She looked for a fire and found a blaze. He sat in his room with his guitar. The night was cold, or maybe it was summer, it doesen't matter. He sat around and thought about alot, what was the point in rendering in a false life. She called again and said it was over. The loved ones left. Was God a dream or life come true. He took the medicine, I think they said it was just the right amount. He slept well that night. He got what he wanted, a continious sleep in place forever. Blood stained the sheets from eyes and nose. Lights flashed and&nbsp;the room shook.&nbsp;Mom don't cry tonight, it will all be alright. This is the happiest I have been since I can remember. The field was covered in black the next morning. Streams of tears came and tore through the barriers of dirt. The hole was dug, the box was laid, the screams were heard, ""It was too shortlived."" Do you miss him so bad it hurts? A rose was laid, a promise made, ""I will see you again."" He looked down that day, and wondered what he had did. Did they care of just feel obligated? Words can't sum up a whole set of emotions, only the heart can. His spirit&nbsp;died down&nbsp;but baby, even memories fade. From voice set childhood, growin up was too much for him it seemed. Darling, spread your wings and don't ever look back for me, noone said this would be easy. Remember the note, mom remember the good times spent. All good things must come to an end, or so it seemed. And baby, don't you make a silent cry apart from me. Spread your wings, dont look for a spark, find a fighting blaze. Noone said this would be easy, Noone said it would hurt so bad.</P>
<P>I am proabably missing alot of what I want to say in here, But I will write it later if it comes to me.</P>
<P>Anyways, I am out</P>

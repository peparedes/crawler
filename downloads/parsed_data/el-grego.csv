"event","So, since Greg is an incapable lard, he wont update. SO i decided i would take the liberty and do it myself. This is Chelsea, by the way. Greg is doing just fine. He is a happy little boy, doing illegal stuff like most young'sters. We wont go into details. Anyways, Gregs sex-life is dull. What else is new? He is also experiencing some ejaculation problems. SHIT, maybe i wasnt supposed to say that? Well then again, it IS HIS journal. Doesnt Greg's icon fit him well? I know, i gave it to him. Like i said, Greg is incapable of doing ANYTHING by himself. So Greg told me to update about how he adores his nipples. Well like anyone cares about that right? Exactly. I think this was a productive update. Greg supports Bush. He told me to write that. :) End of update.

<br>
Saturday - Jasons house/ Atlantic to chill with Peter, Charlie, Paul,
some kid that looked ultra stoned, but wasn't.. Then we went back to
chill at Jasons house. Then I left again to go chill with Alex and
Kacey. Some kid named Jordan came, he isn't that hott, and he needs to

<br style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">
<font style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"" size=""3"">I was pondering away
one day. I was thinking about the stars, I am very into outer space and
what it has to offer and what not. I was thinking about how stupid
people were and how they didn't believe in life forms on other planets.
I may be wrong about life forms on other planets in our solar system. I
mean, how do you think we adapted to oxygen as our life-source? Other
planets would have to adapt to everything else, blah blah blah. <br>
<br>
But my main concern was there are other life forms out there. Whether
you like it or not, there are. Doesn't have to be in the solar system,
it could be trillions of light years away and more! But, where there is
life form, there is religion, and if Christianity is the one true
religion, then how is it that Jesus visited the other planets and those
life forms? As Christians and Catholics and what not, we do not believe
in reincarnation, we believe when you die, what sins youv've commited
and what not judges where you go, no reincarnation. Also, don't go
saying 'Well, Jesu can do it because he is God!' NO! The Catholic faith
tells us that Jesus was man. He became man. The rules just can't bend
for our savior! He was treated like a man, raised like a man, ate like
a man, drank like a man, mastrerbated like a man. etc. etc. <br>
<br>
The point I'm making is how does Jesus get to one life form to the
next? What kind of god would leave his people out of sucha glorios deal
such as this? If you think about it, a fuckin savior!!! You don't
understand the wonders of that! Think of what a new Messiah has to
offer, you honestly don't understand the remarkability of that. But
what kind of god would treat other beings like that?<br>

Them I came home, ended up goin to Jasons.hung out with Blaze, Chelsea, Jason, and Charlie. That was loads of fun, though it seemed like someone was ignoring me, and it sucks ass 'cause that person ""likes""&nbsp; me. It doesn't seem like it, but whatever dude. I'm giving up on her, and this is my <STRONG><U>last</U></STRONG> emo post ever, I promise. You know, when you give up on someone it kinda helps take your mind off them and start to get over them. it's cool, not worrying about someone or always having someone on your mind, though you think you like it when they are on&nbsp; your mind... you don't. It feels a lot better when they're off it too, I love being emo free!! WOOT! Aaah, sucha good feeling. Today, Jason gave me another drum lesson, I didn't do too bad actually.. rather <STRONG>surprsing</STRONG>. Then Blaze came over Jasons house, that was fun, she's really cool and I finally met her!! haha. OH DUDE!! I met Jasons grandma last night! SHE IS <STRONG><EM><U>THE COOLEST</U></EM></STRONG> GRANDMA ON THE FACE OF THIS PLANET!!! I called ger Grandma instead of Granny... and she started pokin me with this gift wrap stuff she had! Dude, it was so cool. Oh I love Granny. Haha, last night she came home and was wasted hahahaha. So awesome, Jason dude, I Love Your Granny!!!<BR><BR>&nbsp;Alright that's it for now, wow, that was a decent entry, later dudes."

Like Jason said in his entry on his xanga... it's angry young and POOR! So, for xmas I'm gettin those pants and a drum set if I really wanna get into yet, which I know I do, but you know just to make sure. Well, this is the part of my journal entry where I write about my lady troubles. I haven't really talked to the girl I like today :\.

And then I remembered promising my sister to sell her shoes which were far to big, so all day I have been taking photographs and writing about items on ebay.co.uk. Oh and it feels so good, wow! I hope I actually make some money, I'm so poor. I have nothing. Eeek."

Quite a good idea really, seeing as I need to get healthy and quick. I've also been reading up on the <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthyliving/>BBC health website.</a>.

I've got loads of time to reflect on school now and oooh one person makes me so mad. This person is one who changes best friends every week (yes, how imature and playground like) and pretends that they are very nice and friendly just to make themselves feel better. They also like to make you think that they are doing you a favour by spreading bitchy gossip and like to make you confess. This person is also very up themself and knows very well how to hurt and exclude people. I've seen it all for myself too, I've seen it been done to everyone including myself. I came up with this nice diagram to illustrate school life:

"event","Yah I know I haven't wrote in here for around five days but to be honest I had very little to say and was stuck in a GCSE daze as I call it, where all I could think of doing was cramming all the revision I could in which I should have done a long time ago before.

I had some bad news today. I got home, feeling quite happy, my test was a ""piece of piss"" and I expected the day to be a lazy day. But when I got in Mum told me I have a problem with my kidneys. I was like OK. Apparently the levels for urea and creatinine are only just below the normal level, but I do sort of question why the nurse didn't tell the much. Apparently the low levels are caused by either:

* Malnutrition
* Poor diet
* Liver Prolems
* Overhydration

And something tells me it will be either malnutrition or poor diet seeing as I'm a vegatarian and have cut out dairy products/ protein products out because I've just gone off them. Yet I was thinking eating more fruit would be better so it didn't matter. My Mum was expecting to say ""B12 is low"" or ""She's anemic"", seeing as all my immediate family are, but suprisingly I'm not any of those so obviously she was very worried to hear the words ""kidney"" mentioned seeing as no one even in our wider family have had problems with this. 

It was all quite odd really. On wednesday night I dreamt of seeing my two old best friends and then all my teeth started falling out and I could feel the holes were they were comming out! The teeth were black, and the whole roots fell out too and I remember walking to the hospital trying to be positive and thinking ""it's not going to be the end of the world if you do have false teeth"". I checked this against <a href=www.myjellybean.com></a> on the Thursday and look:

<b>-If you dream of having gray or rotting teeth, this may be a sign of health problems - see your doctor. </b> Of course I thought nothing of it, I just thought well I saw him last week. Odd? Maybe.

I've had my final three exams and they all went rather well. History was difficult, but managable however I'm not quite sure if I'll get that predicted A*. Just give me one please, so that I have a subject to do at university! Textiles was the exam I was expecting to be really difficult but althought the questions were really long, I'd learned how the examiner would mark it by going over and over it on the AQA website. I also got a 10A* student to help me, and I knew I was on the way to success. I felt so smug having nearly ran out of time and the other higher candidates finished early because they struggled. However although I think I've done really well on the test I assume my practical coursework is shit. It's been designed well, very fashionable et all but I was trying to sneak a peek at what she had graded it at, and I saw G, D, E boxes highlighted although there must've have been some C, B, A's highlighted too. My written coursework was far better than last year, but again got a lower grade. I'm glad it's being sent away. Although she did say to me ""Just add this as it'll support the grade I've given you"", she never said that to anyone else so I guess I cannot have done so bad. Maybe?"

"event","Jah, I should really write in this at the end of the day. But hey, I felt like writing now.

I was very pissed off last night. Bloody football, yeah all you have to do is look out your window and you can see flags blowing from the windows of houses or cars, and now it takes over TV, usually in Coronation Streets place. Are they so stupid to make the connection, the people who like Coronation Street are unlikely to like football and therefore are unhappy about this messing around? 

I was also annoyed it was the last My Family, and Big Brother was rather annoying too. Where was the eviction? I mean what does peace on the house got to do with an extra person staying in, surely the less people there are, the easier it is to make 'peace'? I say it's Big Brothers way of evicting as little amount of people as possible seeing as the more their are the more entertainment there is. 

I did a very good thing yesterday despite feeling bloodless, I saved a bird. My little cat who I believed wasn't clever enough to catch a bird was sat on my rug pawing an innocent little birds between his too paws. I was screaming and screaming and ran to get my sister who was scared and refused to seperate the two. So I picked him up by his fur chucked him to my sister seeing as again, refused to get the bird and I freed it. It flew out, suprisingly. That was my excitment and good deed for the day. 

Does anyone know why Madonna called herself Esther, I know it's that little religious clan, but what's with the name change? I'm watching the weather, and I hate the way they spend ages on the South of England and don't bloody bother with the rest. Wankers."

"event","This looks like it's my first entry then, doesn't it? I've been looking for a diary host for a few weeks now and none of them seemed quite right. I originally wanted a host with which I could design my own layout but designing it prooved harder than I thought. So I'm stuck with quick and easy livejournal. ;)

Today I went to see my GP, and argh I can't and I'm not going to say it, but I've found out I've got something and I've been angry and like why me? And lets just say it's not something like a cold which you can happily tell people about. I'm healthy, I'm clean and I'm a good girl so why me? And oh, to finish off my day I'm going to have my first blood test just to see if there's anything wrong with me. 

So after such a day which made me filled with anger I'm not quite writing the first entry I quite hoped. I intend to include philosophy, fashion, politics and my daily on-goings in each entry, but I'm too tired and am feeling quite arsey."

Later on i went over to Jackies house with Mal and Nicole to get ready for the polar bear beach bash, yep i did just say the polar bear beach bash haha. I ended up leaving that and walked to johns and from johns we went over to dans. We pretty much just loafed around and watched Sweet Sixteen, those spoiled little bitches, im jealous. Dans dad gave me a ride home, what i nice guy haha. I went to sleep at like 9:30 im such a bad ass....

TODAY woohoo i got to sleep in only till 10:30 because my dog came in to attack me. Me and my sister made cheese sticks for lunch they were yummy! At like three laura batora, pretty much the funniest person ever called to go to the mall. So we went. We saw this one dude and Dip and Dots haha he said hey really load so I thought he was talking to me so i screamed hey back and then started laughing because i wasnt sure who he was talking to but then he was following us around so i think he was saying hey to us..haha were losers. Mk so all i got was a shirt and a pair of pants so did laura they are all super cute.

Last night was fun. John and Dan came over and my older sister Kate and her bestest friend Brittany took us to McDonald's. John and Dan were crazy faces and hitting there head on lamps and killing imaginary bugs and at the end of it all they got yelled at, by some flaming men. 

Rachel came over after that yay! We just sat around with Dan and John. Twas fun. While we were hanging out we got interrupted by a loud gay man's lisping voice, ""Keep your penis'sssss in your pant'ssss!"" hahaha it was a knee slapper.

Dan and John had to leave:-(

So Rach stayed the night we watched Zoolander, great movie.

Today wasn't one of the best days but, I did by some new cd's. Dropkick Murphy's and My Chemical Romance. You should check it out. Yep.

I have a eye infection:-( i look like Mr.Mendal. Haha i have wear my glasses for ten days. No biggie.

Right now I'm at Rachel's but she is on the phone with her boyfriend you might now him peter, a interesting character that boy.

So we went to the nurse...dude she has one blue eye and one brown eye...I swear, she's a douche bag. She took her little flash light and put it all up in our eye's and acted like she actually new what she was doing, idiot haha. 

The bus ride was boring as usual. Don't you love how im telling you every single thing, im such a big fag. Well getting back to my day. I came home sat around...AND I GOT MY PHONE BACK..FINALY!!! being grounded blows like no other.

"event","Hello. Well sorry to say but, today was another sucky day with a little side of fun(wtf). My sister woke me up at like 11 in the frikin morning(and no that isn't remotely close to my definition of ""sleeping in"") Then she made me go to Oak brook Mall with her and her friend Brittany which, is quite a cool chick. At least I got to leave this hell hole and, the only reason I did was because my dad wasn't home! So my sister smuggled me out of the house(if you can smuggle things out? I donno..anyway). I guess the mall was fun. We got lost like 2 times and some stupid bitch backed up into us when she was trying to put her frickin convertible top up! What a douche head, the car is alright though! Haha, have you ever been to <STRONG>Nordstrom Rack</STRONG>? Well, its great! They had these absolutely monstrous gogo dancing boots, yup you guessed it I slipped those babies on and did a little dance haha. Then it was time to leave so we went to go drop off Brittany on the way there we saw some skater kids (haha hot too!) outside of 31 flavor's so Kate decided to turn up Toxic ha and got out and danced for them, we know they liked it...haha...Yup. Nothing would be complete tho without a great argument with my sister which left us not talking for the day. ahh the love we have for each other, atleast were talking again! Alright, I'm out. Later, peace."

Since i'm grounded from everthing imaginable(like this computer i am on right now)my family has decided that I don't exist anymore, there's is nothing to do and, I'm constantly surounded by bordum. It's like my dad wants me to go through social isolation, no phone or cell phone, no computer,no tv, the only thing i have is music and that's good i guess. O well it's my fault. I have nothing interesting to talk about because im the boringest person there is, i do have some poems i wrote but, i dont want to sound like some insaine person so ill keep those to my self. I know this sounds wrong but, i can't wait till school on monday. It will give me a chance to see everyone since im in frikin lock down. Well im gonna go because monique is going to make my journal all pretty, wow she is so talented!"

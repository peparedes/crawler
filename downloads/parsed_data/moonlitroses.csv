"event","So last week I got socked with the flu pretty hard and was out of commission for the entire week. Therefore I missed three days out of four. Therefore I missed one of my tests. Therefore I am having to make it up this week.

The part where this really sucks comes in with the fact that I have five tests on a three day week and four of them are on the same day. 

Shoot me. Honestly, just put me out of my misery. I don't have a fever anymore, which is basically the only excuse for not doing anything. Strength to study? Headache? Ability to write with achey flu muscles? Negligible. I could really, really scream. And now I'm going to fail all of them.

In other news, however, I started watching <i>Dead Like Me</I> when I was sick, and... <lj-cut text=""potentially spoilery Dead Like Me rambles"">out of protest for the fact that I will never be able to get all this shit done, have not really stopped. Am nearly done with the second season, and I must say this. It's not a very good show. It's <i>good</I>, don't get me wrong, but it's just not as amazing as I thought it would be. 

Also I don't like Mason/Daisy at all. <i>At all</i>. I went in to the show not knowing a thing, and I honestly thought the set up was for George/Mason which I like SO MUCH BETTER.

I miss Betty. Hell, I miss early s1!Daisy, Daisy Adair. And I am really bloody sick of the Lass family storyline. There's no advancement whatsoever, and frankly, I'm starting to forward through all those scenes. Reggie, I love you kid, but come on! Show me a little more development, here.

Rube is amazing, and Mandy Patinkin reminds me a TON of Steve Martin and ROXY! Sheila Bennet i cu thar! God, the reapers are fantastic."

<i>Leave me a comment and I will give you five words/phrases, which you describe what they mean to you/why they're so appropriate for you.</i>

&bull; NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
LOL OMG, because if you know me, you know that I think the Rick Roll is singlehandedly the GREATEST. THING. EVER. I think this thing could achieve world peace, okay, it is that amazing. And the fact that someone did a <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KANI2dpXLw"">MUPPET PARODY</a> to it is even better. And Beaker is basically Rick Astley in this (i.e., tiny, inconsequential looking boy with A MANLY VOICE), it just makes it that. Much. Better.

&bull; JAMES AWESOME POTTER
HELL YEAH! If you know me, you also know that James Potter is my LOVE! I've been writing fic for him forever and a day, and I'm already upon my two-year anniversary roleplaying him, so I just adore him to itty bitty pieces. I've become a better player and a better writer because of his character, I appreciate the Harry Potter books so much more because I've given Harry's parents' lives a lot of thought, and Lily/James is THE ULTIMATE OTP. Also, you can get away with a lot of shit because you say you play James, this is surprising trufax.

(And JAMES AWESOME POTTER IS HIS FULL NAME, OKAY, THANK YOU, HE'D LIKE TO SAY)

&bull; CALIFORNIAAAA (here we coooome)
ALKHDSG, this is where I am from, f-list! Californiyay. And I love this state, and it is amazing, and I probably won't live anywhere else in my life. The end! Additionally, phrase taken from a catchy, if cliched song by Phantom Planet, as the theme song to the thoroughly trash if somewhat enjoyable teen drama, <i>The O.C.</I>. I find Ben Mackenzie to be all kinds of hot, but the show itself tires me out.  

&bull; DOCTOR WHO
So I started watching this show last summer, and it got me CRAZY. I mean, off-the-walls crazy. It gave me my favorite, most tormented OTP, a new favorite actor, made me stop hating on Billie Piper, got me writing a little fic again, made me kind of love astronomy again, and convinced me that sometimes impossible isn't always such. Unfortunately, this show also works me up a <i>lot</I>, and I probably won't continue watching it because they RUINED THE LAST SEASON FOR ME AND I AM SO MAD THAT THEY ENDED STORYLINES THE WAY THEY DID AND I AM STILL NOT OVER IT AND THEN DAVID TENNANT LEFT AND I AM JUST LIKE WTF SHOW, WTF. WTF EVERYONE INVOLVED, YOU ALL SUCK.

So, yeah. This is why we can't have nice things. 

&bull; BARACK OBAMA :D
If it's a surprise to any of you that I am liberal, that is--well, a surprise for me! I am very much so, and although I'm not heavily involved with politics, I very much so lean this way. Barack Obama was my candidate of choice during the 2008 elections, and while I'm not sure he's perfect for the job, I found him to be a candidate of more conviction than the previous elections' choices.

"event","My grandfather was taken to the hospital today for some problems with internal bleeding, etc. He's staying the night for observation, but they are fairly certain that this is just a minor problem cultivated by too many aspirin for blood-thinning. 

But this isn't really about that. I've been in a bit of a weird place today, very unsure of what the night would bring. Numbness, I suppose, is a good word for it, but hospitals and old age are two things that terrify me so I always face emotional difficulty when facing these problems. 

When my father was a college student in Iowa, he didn't have the funds to pay for college, so he worked a lot of different jobs. I knew that he used to shovel snow, but today I found out that he was, among other things, also a janitor in the university hospital for a good long while. When I was born, everyone always told me I picked a terrible day, because there were pregnant women lining the hallways, and, obviously, no vacant single rooms. I am not entirely sure why this was a very big deal (although I cannot imagine that I would enjoy giving birth in a crowded room, so I suppose there is that), but my father ended up bulldozing his way into a private room and saw that every other need my mother had was filled. I've always admired people who did that, but I just chalked it up to the fact that my father is, especially when he wants to be, a downright scary man. 

But today he told me that when he worked as a janitor, he and his other team members were the first people to know about a room about to be vacated, being that they would need to go in and sterilize/change sheets/clean trash etc. The way he finagled that room was by asking a janitor for the next vacant room and explaining his situation. 

I don't know why, but I just found that to be a very interesting tidbit I felt the need to share. 

Additionally, I saw <i>The Fall</i>, with Lee Pace, two nights ago. It was an amazing, bizarre, and very beautiful movie! Lee Pace is a very beautiful actor as well, but I mean that more in the sense of his acting skills than his looks, although he probably holds the record for being the actor to make me squeal the loudest. And for that, I give you Lee Pace gifs. Because this man is too cute for still pictures:

Not lj-cutting, for the cute, but if it interferes largely with your flist page, please tell me!"

"event","So I was showering and ended up snorting some water by accident, and I think there was a bit of shampoo in it, and it definitely went up my nose. According to those within earshot, I sneezed no less than 15 times in the space of ten minutes, and I have somehow tricked my body into thinking it is sick.

...

Yeah, my thoughts exactly. 

So now I am exhausted, because whenever I sneeze a lot, I feel like falling over dead. And hungry. Ravenous, as a matter of fact. I believe this calls for some good old-fashioned sleep and some food."

Okay, the Porter Scavo scapegoat stuff is getting old FAST, writers. I always knew they were going to be trouble, but. Come on, this is ridiculous. AKSKDSGKLHGLKDH, stop making me flail!

I WANT MIKE AND SUSAN BACK NAO, PLZ. When their kid dropped the bowling ball on Katherine's foot, I laughed so hard. I LOVE THAT BOY, OMG, HE'S SO PRECIOUS.

Also, Bree inviting Andrew's gay life partner over for dinner, and then inviting their gay neighbors over to celebrate. LOLOLOLOL forever. 

OKAY AND THEN. AT THE END, I THINK THERE WAS SOME CRUCIAL INFORMATION REVEALED WITH DAVE AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD AND MIKE, BUT. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I THINK I'M SUPPOSED TO.

WAIT, I JUST GOOGLED IT.

Which means Susan and their boy are in some deep shit, because Dave is going to torture some bitchezz. :\ 

I wish I would stop being right about this whole ""Desperate Housewives revolves entirely around Mike Delfino"" story. Because then bad stuff happens to the only reason I watch this show, and I feel bad. 

DOES ANYONE KNOW OFF A DOWNLOAD COMM? Because I really, really need to track down a few episode to keep <i>forever</i> and I am having some difficulties in doing that.

My professor is so undeniably cool. She flagged me down after class one day to recommend Robert Olen Butler's compiled lecture transcripts book because she was flailing and said it would benefit me a lot, which she could not have been more right about.

In my apartment complex, there's this cute cottontail that has unfortunately chosen this place as his home. We are somewhat friends, in that we enjoy staring at each other a lot for about five minutes before one of us is distracted, but he came nosing up to my window today while I was working on the computer and we were enjoying another staring contest when predators in the form of six year olds with scooters descended upon him yelling ""GET HIM!"" 

I was going to go outside and use my best PETA voice (of which I am not a part of) on them, and do a bit of ear-twisting if I had to, but all of them had disappeared by the time I got there. I might have to do some ear-twisting anyway if it appears my little friend has disappeared for good."

I don't think anything will ever beat season 1 of Desperate Housewives but hot <i>damn</i> this makes up for some of the crazy things they've thrown at us. 

Perks of this episode?

JAMES DENTON. JAMES DENTON SINGING ""MUSTANG SALLY"" ON MY TELEVISION

STEVEN WEBER. STEVEN WEBER BEING HILARIOUS AND A TWO-BIT WALK ON ON MY TELEVSION

Downfalls?

WHERE THE FUCK IS MY MIKE/SUSAN, YOU BITCHES. I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF MY ONE-AND-ONLY-FOREVER-AND-ALWAYS OTP BEING PUT THROUGH THE WRANGLER FIVE THOUSAND FUCKING TIMES ALKDSHGDGH PLEASE STOP IT NAO.

This show makes me flail way more than it should. While, yes, <i>Doctor Who</i> made me actually shed tears, this show makes my eyes prickle nearly every episode. And I flail a <i>lot</i>. 

Also, this entire show revolves around James Denton. I thought it, in the beginning, but it was more of an idle theory.

Now I am like 100000000% sure and also gloatingly thinking, ""HAHA I ALREADY FIGURED OUT THAT MIKE DELFINO > THE UNIVERSE, WRITERS. TRY AND SURPRISE ME NOW.""

Alkhdfkgh cannot wait until tomorrow.

Oh, but sidenote of fail to writers: Lynette Scavo's son knocked up your wife, yis angry barman whose name I cannot remember? Whytf are you so nice to Tom Scavo, her husband, when Lynette saw you beat up your wife and her kid? I do not understand. </lj-cut>"

1. She is always right. Always. Even when she thinks she isn't, someone else proves her right. Alternatively a good and bad thing

2. Australians have excellent taste in cookies (re: Tim Tams)
<i>>>2a</i> Tim Tam Slam does indeed look orgasmic; should be tried

3. One does not write well when one attempts to sit down and throw out thousands of words of wonderful original fiction

A thing Ron has confirmed today, which she already knew, although she heartily wishes it were not true:

1. There are people who are fight for your cause in terrible, malicious, short-sighted ways, and the people who oppose your views may often be perfectly justified, reasonable, and even... <i>humane</i> in their arguments.

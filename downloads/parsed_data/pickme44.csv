"event","I never post of here anymore. I kinda stopped once i started a journal for loves class but i can't find my journal right now so thats probably why i'm back on here.
The CSO was this weekend. the surf wasn't bad and the weather was nice. I was in 2 different divisions, groms which is 16 and under both boys and girls and any type of board, and the womens open which is for women of all ages and any boards. so i ended up surfing 4 different heats on saturday which wore me out hardcore.
I didn't advance through in groms but i don't really mind since there was some really good surfers in my heats but i did end up getting 5th overall in the womens open. i got a couple pictures so i might post those on here after i scan them.

summer is finally here. to bad the weather kinda sucks, which makes it really not feel to much like summer but no school so i can't complain.
I think i might have a 4.0, which would be amazing since i haven't had that since 7th grade and if i do get a 4. i get a new surfboard. yay!

anyways i think i'm going to go pass out because i'm very tired."

"event","So this is what i have learned today. Having to write a 2 page paper of a graph you made in math sucks. So far I have a page and its pretty much all bullshit and i can't think of anything else to say. there is only so much you can write about a graph. i'm thinking since my graph is on what genres of music sell the most cd i might just talk about all the different genres of much you know that way if anyone is confused about what latin or jazz music is they will know by reading my paper. plus it will take up lots of space.
HAPPY late BIRTHDAY ERIN!!! yeah i was going to post that on here yesterday when it really was your birthday but it wouldn't let me log on.
i think a spider tried to eat me last night when i was asleep because i have a ton of bites all over my feet and my right elbow and upper arm. they itch like crazy. 
tomorrow i get to go to portland. i'm so happy. yeah for mr. love writing a cool book and taking all of us to his book reading. syd kasara and i are going to take are old clothes to the buffolo and sell them to make some money but then we will probably just end up spending on some more clothes in there. we also get to go to oasis pizza which is very good and i get to see audrey which is always fun. so pretty much tomorrow is going to rock my socks off.
oh man stars was so great today. all the little kids asked for are autographs. i felt famous and special. it was a good time.
anyways i think i've done enough stalling, so i better get back to my homework."

"event","I hate mr. McCorkle!!! How the hell could he give me a fucking D? i missed one test because i was in california but that isn't enough to bring my grade down from a B to a D. Finals don't even effect your grade that much. He is such a moron. i hate him. i think he just doesn't like me because i don't view everything eye to eye with him. I'm sorry but if you're going to have discussion where you are asking people for their opinions their going to give them. you have to have different points of view for a good disscussion. THATS WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING!! but yes i'm going to go talk to him at lunch and if he made a mistake or something of the sort and if that doesn't work i will go to mr. phelps because he loves me and is rad and will help me fix the problem and if i have to bring up the fact that if you play baseball/football/basketball you get a good grade in his class i will because its not fare that the people who skip everyday are getting a better grade than me. yes i know this post is just one long rant but i'm really pissed off right now and i need to rant. alright i'm done. errr"

swim meet last night. i think i did ok other than my knee really hurts.
my dad is thinking about taking another trip down to southern california because i guess the sand bar at doheny is going off and we both want to surf it really bad and it would be nice to get back into the sun for awhile since it has been so cold here.
mr. dye is mean.
green day is coming back to the us in april! yay
wow so this post has no point to it
i think i migt to yachats this weekend. it sounds like fun and maybe to the movies tonight? i donno

yay i am sitting in dana point california right now. southern part of orange county. its a good time let me tell you. i'm on my godfathers really ghetto labtop right now. it wouldn't let me go on hotmail so i'm going to have a ton of main when i get home. 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANDREW!!!!! yeah big 17. you can now get into R rated movies. wahoo! :) I tried leaving a comment on your lj but the little add comment button wasn't there because like a said this computer is ghetto.

so i just got done surfing tressels (sp?) a little while ago. i went to middles which is weird because middles really isn't in the middle. what is considered lower tressels should really be middles and middles should be lowers. uppers is the only one that makes since. it was kinda choppy but the wind calmed down the minute we paddled out. only one other person out besides my dad, godfather, and i. it was about 4 to 6 feet with nice lefts and rights. i only surfed the lefts. i really did try to catch some rights but i fell everytime. i tried to paddle into this 6 foot left at the last minute. kinda did a superman fall while spinning. i think i kinda tweaked my neck because i really can't bend it to the right

i got a new wetsuit yesterday and the ripcurl shop for a $100. its a 5/4/3 so i will now be warm. yay and i also got christmas presents for some certain people who shall remain nameless.

so far every house and car i've seen has been really nice and really expensive. it seems like everyone is rich down here but i've only been by the ocean so thats probably why everything seems so nice. 

every girl around my age down here looks like emily. really tan with fake blonde hair. very barbieish. i think i've seen one girl with brown hair so far. every guy down here is beautiful but they all kinda of ignore me because every girl looks like emily.

i think we might go up to malibu tomorrow.

anyways i'm going to walk down the beach and watch the sunset
miss you all

i want sims 2 because it is amazing but it costs $50 i will wait till christmas.
Homecoming was last night. it was a pretty good time. left halfway through and went to the arcade. i am the air hockey queen. lol. dinner was fun. 17 of us at brew pub. 
Sam is leaving tonight. I'm going to miss her. it will probably be another year before i get to see her unless i decide to make the 5 hour drive when i go to southern cali this winter. I got to go swimming at the lodge again before she left. 
i'm really not enjoying school this year at all. i think it should be summer once again.
i fell down erins stairs today. the big flight outside. all the way from the top way down to the bottom. I got all dizzy and couldn't hear right for a little bit. it was a good time. I get hurt way to much.
alright i'm tired beyond all belief i must go to bed.

"event","surf comp in cresent city california. the judges were lame and didn't give mattie the score he deserved, everyone i talked to thought he should have gotten 1st or 2nd but he did wonderful even though the judges were stupid. I made it into the semi finals and maybe would have gotten 3rd but i dropped in on a girl on accident and so that dropped my score. blah but did end up getting the good sportmans ship award because there were to hannahs in the heat and they mixed us up and out me in 1st when i know i didn't deserve it so i went to the judges and got the problem fixed so the right hannah won. so i guess i have a big trophy coming in the mail since i didn't stick around for the award cermony (6 hour drive and i wanted to get home at a decent hour).

the comp was pretty crazy though, i met one guy who was in it (his sister was the other hannah) and he is a pro surfer and gets to travel around the world being in surf movies. i want his life. people were there from malibu and such.

cass darling we need to find a way to get to the tbs concert. why does portland have to be so far away?

green days new cd is wonderful. i have been listening to it non stop the past few days.

i'm rather tired. getting up at 6:30 is no fun.

I will be better by thursday though because a really good swell is coming and I want to go surfing.
I liked mr. loves piece on the class blog. Are we suppost to make 5 entries and 5 comments? I should probably post something seeing as I haven't yet but I really have nothing to say, or at least nothing that i really want the rest of the class to read. Mr. Loves class is fun though. I like his style of teaching and all in all he seems like a cool person. I want to invite him to that dinner thing we have to do. I need to find a partner for that. I think I'll ask syd and we will make a ton of food, it will be a good time. 
Elephant is a good movie. Kinda weird but really good. 
I wonder if it is warm outside? Its sunny but that really doesn't mean its warm. If it is I think i might go sit outside for awhile."

yeah i'm pretty much posting these pics just to learn how to post pics.
The comp was fun. I  got second. I was very happy about that. Mattie did wonderful and got third in his heat. Matties, my dad got some pics of you getting your award but he accidently had the camera in video mode and are computer won't let me upload them. lol
I pretty much had to ride stupid white water all during my heat. The current was horrible and i guess i got pretty close to the jetty during my heat but i didn't hit like micheal and derrick did. Paddling out a huge seal scared the shit out of carly and me. haha kamile from the shore thought the seal was a surfer at first and then thought it was a shark. what a silly kid. shes always scared of sharks at south jetty and i suppose that is for good reason seeing as there was a shark was seen there last week. </lj-cut>
haha mattie once we get nose riding down really well I have a rad trick for us to learn.
I think my dad might read my journal. I'm really thinking about going through this whole thing and making it all friends only. 
Audrey was at the pixies concert.....probably about 10 feel away from me and i never saw her. 
i think i'm going to go draw or something"

why is tv so horrible in the morning? there is never anything good on in the morning at thats really the only time i even have a chance to watch tv. 
i think i might go skimboarding with ben and some kid from salem named brandon today. that should be amusing seeing as i'm horrible at skimboarding.

mimi, cass, i miss you guys terribly but i'm sure you are having fun in hawaii.
you say i don't show you enough respect. of coarse i don't, there is nothing i respect or even like about you. i have never hated anyone as much as i hate you. i don't understand why you don't just leave if you are so unhappy here. stop making up excuses for your actions. he doesn't deserve to be treated that way. no one does."

I turned 16. i still can't drive though because i'm really cool like that.
i got my braces off. 
I competed in the pc competition. i took 3rd in my first heat on saturday so i got to advance to sunday in the semi-finals. then i took fourth in the semi-finals so i didn't get to advance into the finals but i'm still happy with how i did. everyone who beat has been surfing for a lot longer than me. gracie, the girl who won i guess is Jerry Lopez's personal secretary talked to me for a little bit. she said she had been hearing about me and that people were saying she needed to watch out for me. i thought that was a little weird but funny.
mattie you did wonderful in your heats. i think you should have gotten 3rd. next year you'll take 1st.
well i guess that is all that has happened. it doesn't seem like that much now that i'm writing it down. maybe i'm forgetting something.
melee is coming august 28. derrick is going to take all of us. i wonder if chris and all them will remember us? i really doubt they will but still i can hope.
i need to buy tickets for death cab for cutie and the pixies. i'm knitting a scarf for it. haha i don't know why, i just really feel like where a scarf to that concert and since i learned how to knit i'm going to make it.

i wanted to go wakeboarding yesterday but it was really really windy. adam and jarle went but they are lot better than me so they can handle the choppy water better than i can. jarle took his digital camera so i had fun taking pictures of them trying to do flips and 360s. i got a really rad picture of adam, hes about 2 feet above the water upside down and his hand is reaching down touching the water and his board is way up in the air. taking pictures of people wakeboarding, surfing, skating, ect. would be a really fun job. 
i hope kamile can take me surfing today. i have to take her to agate, she would love the little left that peels over by the rip.
i had a dream last night that i was at pc competion and i did horrible so when i woke up i was all freaked out. 
well i'm going to go play with the kittens across the street and maybe call kamile.

warped tour was beautiful.
Kasara and Cassandra road up with me and my dad. We got the around one and antiflag was playing. Kasara went off to watch them and find rory and cass and i started walking around looking for syd and erin. Found erin and syd and we walked around to the different booths geting lots of free stuff. I was always going by the early november booth because i'm a loser and my main goal of the night was to meet ace. But i ended becoming friends with their merch guy since i was always over at the booth.
I found matt a little before the TEN played. Erin and i got one person back from the fence during TEN. Erin shouted for them to play ever so sweet and ace said he would but they never did, but they will next time the come to portland.
I met a guy named mike from some band, he told me i had beautiful eyes and than he helped me out during yellowcard. he stood behind me and pushed and the huge guys away from me. he is my hero.
taking back sunday was amazing. the lead singer was hanging upside down from the little poles on the side of the stage about 20 feet above the ground.
By the end of the night i had met every guy from the early november except for ace because he pretty much stayed backstage all day. Syd being the wonderful person that she is wouldn't give up. she was determind(sp?) to have me meet ace and the only way to do this was to get backstage. I had already tired to get back there once but got caught. so syd walked over to a table and we all picked up a side and started walking towards the backstage door, trying to act like we knew what we were doing, and it worked. The security guy didn't stop us because i guess its completely  normal for four scrawny little girls to be carrying a table backstage. Once we got back there we put the table behind a tour bus and stared walking around looking for ace. we couldn't find him so we decided to stand in one place thinking he has to come out at some point. Than this guy named Chris from melee (i think thats how its spelled) walked over and started talking to us and played blackbird on his acoustic guitar for us. We talked to him for awhile and than cass saw ace. so i borrowed a pen from chris and went over and talked to ace and he signed my ticket for me. Then i walked back over and talked to chris about neil young and erin and i named a guy apples. 
We left back stage and were walking out of the venue but got stopped by this one guy and he gave us some of his bands cds and we talked about neil young for awhile. he told me i had the coolest shirt on.i bought a shirt from him and than we all left and went on the 3 hour drive home.
anyways it was a wonderful day. sorry this post has been so long
and it was an earthquake. there has been 3 this morning, each one getting stronger. i was going to go surfing today but i don't feel like getting killed by a tsunami and the moment so i will stay in my house."

Cass, Sam called tonight. They are coming down sometime next week. so you will have a wetsuit soon and you won't have to freeze by surfing without one.
I'm going surfing tomorrow morning. 4 days in a row. I'm very tired and my knee hurts. I'm afraid i'm going to really damage it if i don't let it rest. I can't surf friday because i have to babysit but than i'm taking lessons from that pro who is coming up all weekend.
i need to sleep.
goodnight"

"event","surfing was fun. surf was pretty much just big white water. The guys from eugean who i met last thursday were out. so we surfed together and than chilled on the beach for a couple hours. They are suppost to call me if they go surfing tomorrow. One of them is very cute, big blue eyes and longish blonde hair. Cassandra get a wetsuit so we can go surfing!
I'm proud of syd. i can't say what for or she would kill me but i'm very proud of her.
My knee hurts. my special talent of getting hurt in any situation came through once again.
I wonder what i'm going to do with my life. will i still have the same friends? 
mimi and andrew, when you to get back we should have a big party down at the lake.
working on another drawing. i have pretty much everything done except for the face. i'm scared to scared to draw the face. 
yoga sounds like a good idea right now."

"event","mimi and andrew, i miss you guys a lot. andrew i hope you are hving fun in spain, you didn't really seem to be having the time of your life when i talked to you yesterday. maybe you were just tired. mimi darling i'm sure you will have fun in flordia, its a grand place. 
i'm going surfing today with amanda and kamile. nick was suppost to come as well but valerie showed up at his house so he couldn't. surf is pretty crappy but it will still be fun.
i couldn't sleep last night. it took me over 2 hours to fall asleep and i woke up early today so i'm very tired right now. 
i get my braces off in less than a month. i'm very happy about this.
Fred at the oregon surf shop needs to get back so i can ask if i can have a job. you're suppost to be 16 to work there so i'm not sure if i'll be able to. i'll be 16 in about a month so maybe he will let me.
i think i might go to sleep for a little bit before kamile gets here."

"event","school is out! i now have an entire summer to do nothing but sit on my ass. i should get a job, it will give me something to do.
i relize now that you are everything everyone warned me about. why did i ever like you? what is it about you that just draws people to you? 
surfing with lots of guys is fun. for good thing about surfing with guys is that they will carry your surfboard for you. yeah thats my favorite part about surfing with guys. the guys from eugean were cute. the one with longish hair had an accent but the swedish boys were cuter. i love meeting random people at the beach. 
driving around with andy and keith is funny. we blasted queen with the windows rolled down and all of us wearing really weird hats. the old man looked like he was going to die of shock or something of that sort. i didn't think we looked that weird. 
i wonder what this summer will bring? lots of things i want to do but i don't think those will happen. 
cass and mimi why are we watching the mtv movie awards for a second time? they weren't even that good the first time. well other than getting to see johnny depp.
i'm really tired but i don't think i should be. i got around 10 to 12 hours of sleep last night. i went to bed at 7. how crazy is that? i haven't gone to bed that early in a long time."

"event","i had something i wanted to say but i have forgotten. that seems to be happening to a lot of people. do you think you could consider a thought matter? because matter can't be created or destroyed so when you think of something has that thought always been there and you just haven't relized it yet or is a thought not matter at all. just some weird thing we as humans came up with like time. meh i don't think i'm making much sense, it all kind of makes sense in my mind but i don't think i'm doing a good job of putting it into words.
andrew i'm sorry i hit and kicked you in the face. i didn't mean to hurt you, i just didn't want you to get the waterballons. for some reason i'm really good at hurting football players, just ask jarle. well i'm not sure if i really hurting as bad as i hurt you but still.....
everyone should watch ""in america"" its a rad movie, very sad but very good.
i'm tired and should go to sleep, i'm surfing tomorrow after school with kamile. it shall be a grand time"

"event","today was....interesting but very fun. i saw both ben and derek which made me very happy. i hadn't seen derek in almost a year. i miss that kid. him and syd are really cute together. ben has changed a lot since he moved, but changed for the best. hes more mature, well at times.
i wish derek could come down more often. everytime he does come down he has to run away which is no good.
kamile and i are paddling across the lake tomorrow on surfboards just for kicks. we were going to today but never got around to it.
boys kissing is really funny. haha andrew i know you will probably freak out over me saying that but i think its cute. lol
i feel like i should be doing something productive right now but instead i'm just sitting here writing about pointless things that i'm sure no one cares about. 
hey person that is leaving creepy anonymous comments on my friend's journal needs to stop that right now and get a life! are you really accomplishing anything by doing that? no, you're not. so go find something better to do with your life."

"event","so i'm sitting here at school in the student council room. cassandra got me out of class and i got her out of class. it was a nice little exchange. i really didn't want to have to go to pyschology and cass didn't want to have to go foods.
emily and brian are weird kids but they make me laugh, just like they are now.
i no longer have to see candy (my dads girlfriend) anymore. shes going to stay at someones else house when i'm at my dads. yay!
anyways cass wants to go play outside in the rain. goodbye"

"event","i hate her so much. why can't she just leave my house and never come back. i'm so glad shes moving out. i will throw a party and do a happy dance when she leaves. i don't know why i let her get to me this morning. if my dad calls tonight i'm going to tell him what happened. he needs to know he is dating the worlds biggest bitch. Why does she view me as such a threat? i'm his fucking daughter! she hates the fact that my dad and i have a good relationship. meh whatever i'm being kicked off the computer"

"event","i love weezer. i won't listen to them for awhile and than when i do i'm reminded of why i've been listening to them since i was 6 or 7.

i finished my drawing. i think i like it. if i ever figure out how to post pictures on here maybe i will post it.

i'm going surfing tomorrow with kamile and maybe nick. i think we are going to go to south jetty. i haven't surfed there in almost a year so i'm happy. its one of my favorite spots around here. i've decided i want to be sponsored for surfing by the end of next summer. i really doubt that will happen since i'm not even close to being good enough to get sponsored but still i can hope. i think i'm going to take surfing lessons from this four time world champion surfer this summer, so that should help improve. if she thinks i'm a good enough surfer i might get a job as a surf instructure for the otter rock surf shop.

the morris's are coming down tonight. i kinda hope they surf otter tomorrow that way i don't have to deal with any of the derrick and kamile drama. plus than kamile and i can have south jetty to ourselves. haha i know thats mean but derrick and get mean out in the water.

big fish is a rad movie. everyone should go watch it right........now!

alright i have to go get ready to go to my dads. 
goodbye"

"event","frank sinatra commercials are fun but i really don't think i want to spend all that money so i can own every album he has ever made.
i woke up at 6:30 this morning and couldn't go back to sleep. today is one of my few chances to sleep in but my brain has to go and be stupid and wake up. meh
i have to write a paper for english about my life. haha i'm thinking i should make it about 100 pages and have it have just about every pointless detail about my life and have nothing interesting in it. i really don't feel like sharing a lot of things with Mr. Gerl. if it was sollers that i would have no problem because sollers rocks my world. lol i was out in the hall talking to kris yesterday and sollers walked up and yelled at him to stop bothering me. it was really fun. haha a fight between them would be funny. i'm not sure who would win.
prom is today. i think i should be happier about going but i'm really not. kris and i really don't have much to talk about so the whole thing seems like it might be a little weird.
i really want to dye my hair pink. i have the dye and everything but there is no time for it this weekend.
well i'm off to find food"

"event","today was fun. went to portland with cass and got shoes for prom. hung out with eric. cass i really am sorry but today worked out for both of us ;) hahaha
i know i've been saying this in pretty much all of my updates but i really really want to it to be summer. school is lame and should die, except for sollers class. haha i kinda just left 3rd period yesterday and went to sollers class and watched romeo and juliet with the freshman english class. it was a good time
went to the beach tonight with cass, kamile, ashley, and courtney. hahaha it was fun....and random. yeah i'm leaving it at that lol
kamile and i are going surfing tomorrow. man i'm exciting. i'm really glad i've got a friend to go surfing with now. haha i use to just go by myself :(
meh i should probably go get in the shower or something of that sort since i smell like camp fire and i'm covered in sand."

"event","i want the new sugarcult cd. i need to find a ride to newport or some place that has a cd store. maybe i'll get it up in portland this weekend.
so yeah i got kidnapped tonight. good times. andrew showed up at my door and i was ""kidnapped"". than we went to some persons really nice house on the lake and there were a ton of people there. andrew you still have to sing for us!
got my haircut today. i got about 8 inches taken off and its still a good way below my shoulder. yeah i had extremely long hair. i think kamile is going to dye the underside hot pink this weekend. probably thursday or something (yes i know thats not the weekend but theres no school so in my mind it is)
i'm going to prom. now all i have to do is convince syd to go so i will have someone to hang out with while i'm there. really i should hang out with my date but as cassandra knows i'm not to good at doing that. lol
last week one of my best friends, who i usually one get to see once a year in the summer because she lives in palm springs, just showed up at my school. man i was so happy. her family is going to buy a summer house up here so i will get to see her all the time now. yay
derrick turned 18 the other day. that just dosn't seem right. i've known him since the day i was born. time goes by way to fast."

I want everyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want. Then I want you to go to your journal, copy and paste this allowing your friends (including myself) to ask you anything."

"event","i feel as if i should be doing something but there dosn't seem to be anything to do. its to late to go on a random adventure in the woods which is what i kinda feel like doing but i'm a wimp and i don't like being outside by myself at night. besides there are bears in the woods where i live. i don't want to run into a bear....well i have before but i don't want again.
i went surfing last weekend and my face got really really burnt. i looked like a tomato for 2 days and than it went to a pretty golden brown but now its peeling and i'm pissed. i forgot how easily you get burnt while surfing and i was a loser and didn't put on any sun block. 
i really can't believe i'm saying this but i kinda like avril lavignes new song. i don't know there is something catchy about it. the video sucks but maybe thats just because you have to watch avril prance around in her little spike belts and chains trying to be really hardcore. I'm trying to get the song out of my head by listening to some afi but its not working.
i've given up trying to do well in school. all i can think about is summer. so my grades are starting to fall once again. i have a c in math when just last semester i had a 110%.
i think i might go call ashley. she is always a good person to talk to when i'm bored because we find humor in the weirdest things when we are together."

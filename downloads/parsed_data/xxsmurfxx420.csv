<i>""And The Phoenix's cycle had reached<br>zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He<br>emerged from his own ashes, to be forever<br>immortal.""</i>

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

As a member of Form 0, you are a determined<br>individual.  You tend to keep your sense of<br>optomism, even through tough times and have a<br>positive outlook on most situations.  You have<br>a way of looking at going through life as a<br>journey that you can constantly learn from.<br>Phoenixes are the best friends to have because<br>they cheer people up easily.

Once upon a time there has a young PROSTITUTION named HECTOR. He was MILKY LICKER SHITING in the FAG forest when he met QUEER JENNY, a run-away COCKSUCKING BITCH from the UGLY Queen RACHEL THE WHORE.

HECTOR could see that QUEER JENNY was hungry so he reached into his GAY and give him his PECKER HEAD SHIT. QUEER JENNY was thankful for HECTOR's SHIT, so he told HECTOR a very STUPID BITCH story about Queen RACHEL THE WHORE's daughter GAY ROB. How her mother, the UGLY Queen RACHEL THE WHORE, kept her locked away in a PRICK TOP protected by a gigantic COCK, because GAY ROB was so BITCH.

HECTOR FUCKED. He vowed to QUEER JENNY the COCKSUCKING BITCH that he would save the BITCH GAY ROB. He would SUCK the COCK, and take GAY ROB far away from her evil mother, the UGLY Queen RACHEL THE WHORE, and FUCKING her.

Then, all of the sudden, there was a FUCKING ASSHOLE LICKING POOPEY OFF A DIRTY ASS and QUEER JENNY the COCKSUCKING BITCH began to laugh. With a puff of smoke he turned into the gigantic COCK from his story. UGLY Queen RACHEL THE WHORE ATE HIS NUTS out from behind a DICK and struck HECTOR dead. In the far off PRICK TOP you could hear a BANG IN THE ASS ON THE DOOR."

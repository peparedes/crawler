"event","Driving is fun. Hello, journal readers. We meet again. Something I find funny: Whenever I drove with Kathy, I'd drive her insane. Because, whenever there weren't any cars in my way, I'd kinda slack off when making a left turn and cut off the hypothetical car that was hypothetically next to me. It makes sense...like whenever we'd be in a parking lot or parking garage, and she wanted to go to the next little section over, she'd actually travel all the way down and turn where 'your supposed to', when there was a perfectly good amount of space if she just cut across and drive through some empty slots. Which is what I did (when she wasn't there, muahaha)
So, yeah, I get a little lazy with the rules when, as I see it, they don't NEED to be taken to full effect. If there are other cars, I'm not cutting anyone off....it still makes her crazy though, hehehe.
Good times....
Anyway, other than that, not a whole lot has been a-going on around here...other than that band trip that I took, which was way fun..I'll probably post some pictures up somewhere, and tell about the trip while narrating the photos. 
Ugh..tired...Must...Sleep....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

"event","Ok, ok, boredom: In the Mummy Returns, if you notice Evee's bracelets when she's in the house (noticeable when she's walking up to Alex who just barely closed the chest again) you see the bracelets are little gold braid thingys. (I think they're quite cute, I want some..). And if you notice in her flashback way later in the movie when she's standing on the balcony watching her father (Seti I, father of Ramses II...just so you know) get killed, you can see her bracelets then too, and they're the exact same ones. 
I wonder if this was plotted for some odd reason, or they simply ran low on accesories, I don't know...
OMG, I have seen this movie WAY too many times...damn my boredom and love of Ancient egypt and the killing of things! Damn it to hell!"

"event","Oh the joy of pretty things and bright colors...
Right now, as nothing is happening, I am sitting at my desktop computer and am watching The Mummy Returns on Jack's laptop, which is next to this comp....Dude, Dwayne Johnson is sexy. I don't care what other people say :D
Today was odd...While me and Kathy were at lunch, she decided to ""talk with me"" about sex. It was an interesting conversation, mostly consisting of me telling her that she's already attempted to talk to me about sex and we (I had thought) decided she didn't need to since I already know what to do about sex, and besides; I'm not even dating. Sheesh...
I also told her not to expect me to tell her when I have sex, or even if I get a boyfriend. She understood, but I suspect some senility will come into play some time in the future and she'll once again attempt to ""talk with me"" about sex.
Oh, Joy.
Other than that, however, my day was uneventful but filled with joyous sleep! :D Oddly, however..I have discovered I'm happier when I havn't slept more than 8 hours..perhaps it's because I get more time to experience the lovely summer day!
Wow..I am SO bored...time to veg out and watch the movie while only sort of playing on the internet...
BTW, in the Mummy Returns, in the first scene with Evelen and Rick where she kicks the snake...It LOOKS like a coral snake, which is in fact poisonous, but it is actually a Milk snake, which is harmless. A coral snake's stipes are slightly different: The red stripe touches the white stripe. But with the milk snake, the red stipe only touches the black stripes, not the white ones. There's a rhyme that goes with it, but I can only remember the part that goes ""Red touches black, you're ok Jack"" or something like that...
anyway, just so you know..."

"event","Oh, I do love the infinate possibilities of poetry...
I just spent like, 3 hours on www.Poetry.com, submitting poems of my own and reading poems by other people...there are a lot of people with my last name, going around and submitting their badly spelled poems. Although not all the poems were bad, at least not in my opinion...just poorly grammatized. As if that's a word...I dunno...
I do, however, LOVE this one poem by a woman name Christine Fluet...She only has one up there (unfortunately...)
Anyway, since you're so bored a person that you would honestly read this, I'm going to assume that you're so bored as to be the sort of person who also reads my poetry. So why don't you just go onto WWW.Poetry.com, and inside the little search area you can look for Christine Saffell...
btw, no, I don't know why there is a seperate name and title for each, as opposed to listing all the poems under my name (which should be listed just once)....I simply do not know. So don't ask. However, if for some stroke of luck (or a stroke of something else..what you do in your free time your business...) you do happen to know how to FIX that, do fill me in.
Anyway, I'm off to do other things...perhaps sleep will be one, though I doubt it...Fare thee well, my fine friends. And may the wind be always at your back."

"event","Ok, I just read my previous post...I actually don't feel like continueing that, it's all basically the same...
Anyway, I'm sick of bitching. I actually had a good day today:D Relatively uneventful, but I don't feel bad. There was some interesting tv on, plus I finally got around to cutting Kathy's (my mom) hair, so she's happy with that and will finally stop asking me.
Kate (my sis) is in the living room right now, as Im in the dining room..I really want her to leave so that I have this part of the house to myself. When she took until 3 AM last night to leave, Tom got home shortly after, so I was kinda bummed about that. Although, when I got back into my room, Space Ghost Coast to Coast was on!!! I LOVE that show..god, it's so bizarre and HILARIOUS :D
I know I should probably work on my book right now..I'm writing a fantasy kinda...drama fantasy, I dunno, I havn't decided what it is yet...I've been writing it since I was 13, so I've grown pretty attatched to it. I also like 2 other stories floating around in my head, but I want to finish this one before I move on to them. It's almost done, but I've really been slacking off on writing it lately...I need to add more detail into it, and it'll be very laborous and I think that's why my Will has just been shrugging off that part of my brain. It happens. 
When the Will decides to ignore my logic/any other part of my thinking, the brain doesn't really matter anymore. For good or worse, I'm one of those people who has to be convinced upon our own terms before we put forth more than half-ass effort. I think the saying is half-ass..sounds like it....
Aww, my little kitty is sleeping on my lap..she's so cute...Oh god..now I'm one of THOSE people...(Call in the reenforcements!!!)"

"event","So I went to sleep after writing my previous entry, and I was abruptly awoken by my mother asking me to help my step dad Jack with the Easter meal he is preparing. For some reason, she decided I'd be best to work on the Strawberry Shortcake...made with that angel food cake that's been on that counter for the past 2 days, taunting me with its delicious lightness!!!......
Anyway...So when I tell her that I've never even had SSC, she looks at me like I'm insane, then a look of sudden recognition comes over her face as she realizes that yes, that must be. Then Jack looks absolutely appalled at the thought, and Kathy explains to him that since I was the youngest of 5, by the time I was old enough to apprieciate anything she baked or cooked, she didn't do it anymore because she a single working mother. And suddenly the thought of what a shit head my older brother Tom is for saying I'M spoiled came to me. But then of course, comes the question of what makes one spoiled? Is it attention, or material objects? In this case, let me present to you my arguement of what a shit head my brother Tom is:
Ex 1: Tom accuses me of being spoiled when I get cable in my room. <i>note: I get cable in my room because we were already wiring the house with it, and if I didn't get the cable I'd be out in the living room which is his space, watching it. </i>
Ex 2: Tom accuses me of being spoiled once again when I ask Kathy to let me drive. My arguement; ""It doesn't matter how many F's I have, if I were allowed to drive you wouldn't have to drive me/me and my friends around! I could run errands for you, and if you're so damn worried about me 'mental and emotional health', then why the hell won't you let me leave this house?"" <i> note: it's not like I complained that I can't drive, it's that I continue to ask in a pleasant, almost joking way. Besides, that asshole dropped out of high school, and they let him drive...sure, he's over 18, but in comparison to my siblings, I'm an academic scholar...well, no..John graduated...but not with the best grades, let me tell you that...</i>  
Ahh, crap, they're coming in..I'll continue this later"

"event","Ok, today flat out sucked! Hm..maybe that's not the best way to start off this journal thingy, but hey, it's true.
Right now I'm listening to my tv, which is showing kid rock's music video, a song obviously about Pam Anderson and hence, does not interest me.
So what happened today, you may ask, which made it so ultimately terrible? Nothing. Nothing happened, and that's the point.
My life is uneventful, uninteresting, and sometimes I really tend to bore even myself. My friends... hey, I love my friends, but for some reason I don't feel like I can truly be the FULL me around any of them. My friend Mary is awesome, and I like being around her. She's probably the one friend I have that I can stand being around for more than 1 or 2 hours at a time. Someone I can just watch tv with, and basically just be bored with and be ok with that. But the rest of my friends can push me to the point of making stuff up just so I don't have to be around them anymore, you know? Too much is too much.
But the fact is, I can't even understand myself half the time, so how I can expect other people to get it? Parts of me want to be shallow and comment on what some girl was wearing and go over the trivial and pathetic things in life. Another part loves documentaries, and likes people who I chat/debate about things like volcanoes and hitler and how interesting gravitational theories versus quantum physics is. Then once again, there's my taste in music which none of friends seem to share (which is actually ok with me, but is something that I suppose on some level matters a little). 
And I could probable say a million things more...but...well, I don't really want to. I feel crazy enough when these little over-analyzations find their precious ways into my head, and quite frankly I just want them out!
Hmm...I feel like eating caramel popcorn right now for some reason...eat caramel popcorn and watch The Mummy Returns...yes..yes, I think I'll do just that...good times..."

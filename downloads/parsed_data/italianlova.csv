ok, sometimes I feel like SJP :) Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City, or in...whatever it is.
I should be a columnist.

So I can't sleep and I can't stop thinking about that damn beetle!  I mean it had to have been a couple of feel tall!

Anyway....thanks to a little someone tonight....I haven't yet thought about the idea of this definitive, (shifty) line between sexes.  I always thought we were on the same page, but you know what....ohmigod!  I'm totally wrong.  Why would I EVEN think that women and men can ever be on the same page....okay, it can happen...but........look at the big picture, you know what I mean.

So, the separation of sexes makes sense to me...why?

I've been friends with women pretty much my whole life and that includes my beloved gay men.  And then there are the two straight man friends I have and only one of them is an exception to my thought process...don't ask why, he just is...and 20% of it probably also has to do with the fact that I've never been in a relationship with him.  Anyway....

so after finally having been in and still am in a heterosexual relationship it would make sense for me to be perplexed and shocked to understand the thought process of a straight man....I know I'm generalizing and I'm sorry, but really...I don't think ANY human analyzes stuff as much as me, so I don't think that any man...is gonna have a thought process like mine...that of a woman's.... sprinkled with a little Rita, which makes me...me!  and every man like he is ....AND I would find any man perplexed and shocked to really understand my inner workings...

so that's that...

and suddenly...my frustrations have dwindled...and now...all I can think about is that damn beetle!

thank you my dear for bringing that up."

"event","...i'm updating :)  September 2005 was the last time I updated.  I'm on here bc I want to insert a quote that I posted once before on LJ.  I've never loved a quote so much in my life and I stumbled across it while I was perusing through the old postings.

 ""...and I live in a world where the two truths coexist; where both hell and hope lie in the palm of my hand.""

~Alice Sebold, ""Lucky Bones""

I just can't stop repeating this quote over and over...I love it...it's powerful and it's so tactile for me.

So, like I said I was looking at my old postings and then, I seemed to have more time or at least whenever I posted to be really carefully introspective, which gave me some poetic peace about whatever I was trying to say.  I still write a lot...always have...in other journals.  I'm up to 18 now...never lose the time to be or feel introspective, b.c when I'm not I feel like I'm losing myself.

And another...

""Dum Spiro, Spero""

- as long as I breathe, I hope.
( ""given"" to me by a friend)

it's refreshing to feel words that are so powerful for me.

"event","I'm reading this Nick Hornby book, ""A long way down"".  
I really like it, but I choose not to give you my quick synopsis of the book...I'll give you theirs...

""Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen.  Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk-show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother.  Three are British, one is American.  They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.

In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells the story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality.""

A few choice passages have just recently caught my eye that I want to share.

""I guess everything in the world---reading, eating, sleeping---has something buried somewhere inside it that just makes you unhappier.""
~  I mean, c'mon...for me and maybe for other ppl out there...this statement is so true, especially if and when you're sad and/or depressed.

""And you probably also know that when you look out of an aeroplane window and see the world shrink like that, you can't help but think about the whole of your life, from the beginning until where you are now, and everyone you've ever known.  And you'll know that thinking about those things makes you feel grateful to God for providing them, and angry with Him for not helping you to understand them better, and so you end up in a terrible muddle and needing to talk to a priest.""

~ Ok, so I do this too...but I'm wondering how it would be if you were an Atheist(sp?).

I don't know...I really have nothing more to say..."

- Alice Sebold

my sister's birthday is tomorrow, in 20 mins.  It's nice to see my dad give my sister such a thoughful gift.  I only hope he doesn't forget mine this year.  It's nice when people do such thoughtful things for me.  Unfortunately from growing up until recently, whenever that may be, I get a strange feeling when people do these kind things for me.  I'm not used to it and it makes me want to shake off this foreign, unnatural feeling.  I'd rather stick to what I know, what I'm used to and try not to get upset along the way.

There is always too much time to think at home.  There's not too much time to think while in Bloomington.  I work or I work out.  At night, I read...just in case of the possibility I'll drift into a seamless string of thoughts.  Although, when it's time, I allow these thoughts to be recorded on paper...almost every day.

I think one of my biggest fears is growing accustomed to the absence of presence.  People like to believe that the heart grows fonder while in separation of familiarity.  I'd rather stick to what I know.  The heart grows indifferent bread from change.

I'd rather stick to what I know...

me--grown from scattered memories of hits and misses...and misses.

I spent most of my day inside hanging around with my dad before I left to go to Chicago.  I left around 2 and damn 80/94, I mean...are you kidding me with the neverending construction on that effin' road!  So shopping was good, but now that I'm making money I'm actually really stingy with spending money.  I kinda have a death grip on my cash now.  I did find a shirt for myself and a shirt for a friend at H&M.  Who can go wrong with that store, seriously?

I met up with my sister after she got off of work and we had dinner and then went to my professor's gallery opening and it was great.  It was nice to see him again and all his work is just amazing and inspiring to me.

what I really wanted to comment on is the fact that my sister amazes me.  I'm not dependent on her every word and I wasn't seeking out a deep moment with her with my issues; it just happened.  She never ceases to amaze me with her ability to make me feel better.  My heart lifted the night I left Chicago.  I'm not saying that all who I have talked to about my issues haven't helped me, but she approached my problems at a whole other level that I didn't even see to do.  What is it about siblings and their crazy connection?  I guess we are of the same blood.  I can't imagine my life w/o her."

I watched home videos last night on the uber old movie projector.  You know, like from ""Wonderyears"".  ""what would you do if I sang out of tune...""  Anyway, it was such a warm feeling.  I watched them with my mom and dad.  I couldn't stop laughing at baby Rita.  I was a speedracer when I was crawling!  and then my head...why was my head so big!?  You know, I'm not gonna be modest I was hella cute and my sister was cuter!  She looked a little more Asian though...flatter face and nose, haha.  Anyway, in my reel gina was being really sweet to me and taking care of me...just like a big sister.  It's weird to see that love and affection from then b.c even though I know it existed it's different to see it.  I mean, most ppl never have any memory of that when they're younger.  My dad treated us so well.  Man, my diapers were huge-ass, bc we weren't the richest family ever my mom used cloth diapers on us.  I also have this old photo of me and my mom together at the dinner table and I was eating my first solid food, which was bigger than my head...it was corn on the cob.  Funny that I hate corn on the cob now.  So yeah...my dad actually got that moment on film when I was eating the corn on the cob and I was gnawing on that thing like it was my job!  I occasionally looked to mom for approval and I went at it again.  I looked so happy and shit, of course nothing was bothering me except for maybe if I took a dump in my pants, but...gosh...I know I'm being dramatic right now, but everything was so simple and innocent.  I know you can't stop a growing mind and blah... blah...blah, but it seems like it was the one time in my life or in anyones life that we were really content....Now, I know this is such a loaded comment I'm making right now, b.c to be happy you have to figure out how to deal with your problems first and things don't come that easy...it's life...it's gonna kick you in the balls every now and again, but gosh...seriously...I was a happy baby, what the hell happened!?  Plus, my mom said I slept a lot.  Thank God I was a smart baby and caught up on my sleep then!

All I have done is shopped around town, hung out with my parents, and watched a lot of tv.  Oh and I have done a lot of thinking.  Well, here and there at least.  It'll come and go, hit me hard or not at all.

~Drive basically the speed limit.
I'll allow myself about 5 miles per hour over and 10 when driving on the highways and expressways.  
I suppose I'll just use my discretion, but no more than 10. 

~Learn to listen a little bit better.  
Okay, here's my whole thing with listening.  I've been trained to have selective hearing or just drown people out with my thoughts, but that's bc I've been doing that with my dad for years.  If you knew my dad and was his daughter for the past 22 years you would know what I'm talking about.  Unfortunately, it has carried over to my other relationships, oops!  Some people just accept it and move on, others don't.  I really do listen when people have issues and I promise, I give really great advice, but I suppose I should try my hardest to listen all the time or maybe I do listen and care a lot, I just get distracted so easily.  Whatever the case, I will try.

It was one this afternoon and I decided I was gonna up and leave to go shopping.

I told my dad and he kinda freaked out.  He's like, ""I can't believe it!""  What's there to believe...bye!  of course I did not say that, but he continually tried to sway me into not going.  Apparently the weather will be bad tomorrow he told me, so that means I couldn't go anywhere today.  He was just worried, but I do this shit all the time where I just randomly up and leave Bloomington to go to Indy.

So I bought a couple of things at H&M.  The rest I'm saving to get til after Christmas.  I'll have money then.

After awhile, I did realize that walking around Chicago by myself at night probably wasn't the best thing to do.  Really, I was comfortable doing so until I was walking back to my car where my sis lives, which isn't the best part of town.  Plus, earlier today I was watching the news and there were 2 rapes in Wrigleyville the other night.  Sigh.  Whateva.  I was fine.

Just got a drink with a friend and now I'm here.

I'm so happy I didn't pack too much.  I've been in my pj's the better part of the time I've been home.  Reason: Because there's two feet of snow outside of my window and I'm not driving anywhere.  Apparently, we're supposed to get more snow.  Blast NW Indiana weather even though I do appreciate it more times that not.

Oh and I spent the better part of my day yesterday on the phone.  I love a good time on the phone, especially when the conversation is good, long, and free.  Surprising how just one phone call can brighten anyones day.  My mom was dancing around in a her long johns because of it.  I kid you not.  Never deny the power of any phone call.

Anyway, I feel Christmas break is the time for myself and others to mend broken wounds and hearts.  I hope, for others, in time for a new year. 

Looking back on the semester, what do you regret?"

"event","I'm updating because it's Christmas break and I have nothing else to do except sit on my arse and watch DVD's with my father.

I believe the last time I wrote was in May.

Since May, I have traveled to a few different states in the summer and had a hell of semester.  It was an interesting semester to say the least.  It was emotionally frustrating for so many reasons: school, friends, and home.  Yes, this is fairly general, but I'll spare you.

It's my senior year and I'm supposed to be leaving Indiana University in May, but that may not be the case.  I would love to try out for my BFA in photo.  If I get in, I'll be at IU for another three semesters.  Anyone who knows me will be surprised with this decision and curious as to if I will survive, because ever since the day I stepped out of my dorm at Collins my frosh year, I've wondered what the hell kind of decision I made by coming to Indiana University.  Ever since then, I never really developed a great affinity for IU.  If I choose to stay at IU, I'll be okay.  If I'm doing something I truly love, then I'll be okay, not the best, but I'll be fine.

There is also the option of transferring to Herron School of Art.  It's almost not worth it to transfer because as of now, I do not know if all my photo credits transfer.  It's almost easier to stay at IU because I have established myself, but there is also my sanity at stake here as well as a healthy, nonplatonic relationship with anyone, which is utterly nonexistent at the moment.  Actually, it's be been dormant for quite some time.

There will always be too many decisions to make with too little time, but I suppose that could be my fault.  I'm nervous and all too excited.  The only thing that I aspire to do right now is be a great success.  I have so many options and there are so many decisions I have to make to make sure I'm happy, so it could be overwhelming.  However, it's the first time in awhile that I've felt like myself.  It's good to finally feel ""normal"" again.  As far as school goes, I feel inspired.  Also, as far as my character, I've never felt more creative.  

There have been too many times where I've felt at a loss with school and with my life outside of school and it has affected the way I've felt about myself and my friends.  Life's like a effin' teter toter (sp?)!  When one thing is up, the other must be (go) down.  Well, for now, at least one thing is up.

""Sleep, Sleep tonight and may your dreams be realized.""
~ This is only one phrase of a song that was given to me by a good friend.  The song was written in memory of Martin Luther King Jr.
  It is an amazing choral song.

I'll write more later.  I can't cover six months in one night ;)"

OR if I call you and you know your phone is gonna die, please for God's sake LET ME KNOW!  b.c I will not immerse myself into another story with you.

I have had numerous times when friends or my sister have had ""phone"" problems and just couldn't talk to me or couldn't call me back.  The first and second times that ""problems"" have happened...sure, that's fine...maybe even the third time, but after that...you better believe that I will start hating your phone!  I'll resent you and your phone...

Now, you're probably thinking that I'm crazy, but trust me I know what's going on....

Really, cell phones should be used for emergency purposes only and land lines should be used for chatting purposes only.  I believe this now, but later I won't.  Use your phone responsibly and don't piss me off while using it.

Ummmm, I'm still not done with classes b.c I'm in summer session.  I'm taking marketing and photography, which I'm looking forward to as much as I can being that it is summer.  Then again, what else would I be doing if I didn't have classes b.c I only have 2 days scheduled and I need some mad cash for the trips I'm taking this summer, ugh!

I worked my ass off this semester.
It was emotionally and mentally rough, but you know, what's new?  each year is like this for me and I've gotten used to it....kinda.  The good that has happened to me so far since I've been at IU doesn't outweigh the bad.

I'm getting apprehensive about the future.  I only have one year left.  It's like being stuck in between a rock and a hard place.  I don't want to look back, nor do I want to stay...yet my anxiety about the future is almost leaving me stagnant even though I know eventually I'll move forward to my goals.

I've been aggravated lately...about ppl.

I still want a boyfriend even though I know I don't need one.  My friend told me that she believes I'll meet someone in graduate school, b.c (in so many words) no one here is really what I want or need.  She also thinks that no one is worthy...sweet girl, eh?

ummmm...so far summer has been good, yet I'm still frustrated.  damn, I just want a break.  I wish you could get a break from life.

Friday night, shitty night at work.
Saturday night, CRAZY MADNESS!  Valentine's Day at the Siam House was non-stop, on-my-feet-for-6-hours customer service.  Lord.
-then a Rita had balls moment-
then a jaunt to Indy.
It was worth it to pay an eight dollar cover to dance for an hour and a half at Talbot's again (where I went for New Year's).  There is just something about a gay dance club/bar that makes a straight girl feel free and uninhibited.  All I did was have fun and when my friend left to go to the bathroom or left to say hey to another, I just kept on dancing.  It didn't matter if I was by myself for a few mins b.c I was okay, no one's there to judge you.  Dancing was probably the best way to unwind from the night.

the next day I spent shopping with another friend at Keystone.  I needed this day to get away from Bloomington.  Unfortunately, I'm back here again.  But I had a wonderful day, and all I wanted of myself was to quit worrying about what was waiting for me in Bloomington and to just enjoy myself.

I must say though, I just might enjoy the day a hell of a whole lot better this year than I ever have.  Every year, I would wear black in great aversion toward the damned holiday.  Through college I slowly have gotten better of accepting the day and just thinking...just let it be, ppl are happy...let them have their day.

but really, let's just think about this...it's nice meeting new ppl and the dating scene is fun and all, but I think it's important to know that there are many other ppl NOW in your life that do care about you and love you.  Ppl that know you the best and know your slightest quirks.  These ppl are what Valentine's day is about.  So sometimes, I think, well...gosh, if I have all of this, why do I bother trying to find someone to 'be' with rifling through the mess of ppl here at college...I mean really, earlier...I was being a big lazy, cynic and I still am, but really, I mean, the effort you must put in to getting to know a guy or girl just to...I don't know, hope to expect that something is gonna happen from it, ugh...it's like doing chin-ups, it's just so exhausting, haha!  and sometimes, you JUST don't get anywhere.  Although on occasion, you will find a great friend.  I suppose it's an experience, and something that should not be with regret, so I'm really torn...I guess I'll really never have an open-minded view of whatever it is I'm talking about till it actually hits me on the head.

""Adept as you are guffawing through even the worst nightmares, it's becoming harder to pretend that you're suffering from frustration and anxiety about the future.  Still, the shift in direction this month of the ruler of your 3rd house should provide enough mental stimulation to keep you blissfully preoccupied.  But you can't go on forever indulging your lusty desires and retreating to a fantasy world where you're always wanted and never rejected.  Judging from the eclipse in your 6th house, it's about time you got off that kick and went back to work.""

usually, I don't believe this mumbo jumbo, but some of it strikes a cord with me and I'm sure you know which ones they are.

I can't say this semester has been terribly great, b.c it hasn't and I'm dealing, but really, from here on out it's just gonna get harder and that's the cold, hard reality.

on an upside, the cover of the mag is ""TV's Gay Heat Wave!""
and on the cover is hot Gale Harold from Queer as Folk, that's Bryan and in reality he is totally straight...it just gives hope to a young girl's heart :)  PS the third season comes out on DVD Feb. 24.  I've got the first and second season in the bag, so bring it on...I'm ready for the third!"

so last night was good...went to go see Lord of the Rings.  It was mother effing long, but it was damn good and that Orlando Bloom, UGH, SO HOT!  So I went with my friend from home, I swear the craziest things happen to her when I'm with her.  This time, she was sucking on an ice cube and it slid down her throat whole, so she felt like she was choking AND at the same time getting frost bit!  I mean, it's really all in the presentation, but it was JUST funny the way she was saying all this in the movie theatre.

Plus, I'm a cracky and I screamed at the most inappropriate time of the movie...
then at the end, you CAN NOT tell me that the platform that they were all standing on did not look like a phallus, b.c it did!

OH and you better believe that I brought my down throw to cuddle up to in that damn theatre.  Yea, that's right!  I brought a blanket with me.  Really, I just didn't want to bring my coat b.c it was decent outside, but I knew I would want something with me in there.

then we ran in to a couple of former students from Wheeler, couple of guys that were a year of ahead of us, one of which I've always thought was just gorgeous!  we chatted for a min or two but that was it.

ok so my anger....
one reason-not gonna say
the other-my mom
how is it that I get in an argument with her the day before I leave.  I'll try to mend what is now messed up.  But really, I guess the moment you get into a fight with your parents is the moment you know the limit for you being home.  For me, that would be a week.  But honestly, who goes to three different places to get three different items, when you can obviously get them in one place.  I realize that this is ridiculous to argue about, but you weren't there.

It was a great experience!  Really, it was the most aggressive haircut ever! AND he told ME what should be done to my hair, see I love that! I need opinions, but I did get to have my say.  I feel like I look different in a very funky, sophisticated way and I didn't get that much length off either.  It an extreme razor cut hairdo.  For me, it was an expensive cut...but it was worth it.  I felt bad though, bc anywhere I go I tip 20% and for some reason this time I couldn't do the math in my head and I only gave him 15%, ah well.  but yeah, it feels so much lighter and looks less dragged down, I'm excited!

Although, the pics turned out really well, but we're not a couple for God's sake! hah.

oh and my boss from the gallery, she's giving me this small torso sculpture that I absolutely LOVE for Christmas.  It's gorgeous!

alright, that's all for now...'s been awhile but since I have nothing to do, I'll update a little more often.
Peace."

"event","Well, for starters...
let's begin with my bday.  Really, it wasn't so terrible.  The day was pretty normal until I got out of class, and then my friend took me out to dinner, where I got the chrome rocket!!!! and then another to Yogi's.  Nothing too crazy b.c I had a test in the morning.  Now, I apologize bringing this up again, but I'm just stating the facts and this will be the last time I mention it for awhile.  Umm, well, kinda a lot of people forgot about me on my birthday.  Don't feel bad though, b.c ""you"" (in general) were one of many-ish.  I don't know, it's sad and disappointing, but I guess it happens.  Ppl get busy, etc.  It's just that every year, I let it go...I guess, I just can't this time...I don't want it to be okay.  I just care too much this time.  Maybe it's b.c I turned 21.  I think that, I guess, some of it's my own fault, my phobia of my own birthdays has to do with all the disappointment of expectations not being met over the years, I let that get me down.  But really, I'd like to have some expectations in my life instead of so nonchalantly being so indifferent about them.  But this is as far as I will go to publicly record my feelings, so...onward

ummm...night after, went out to Upstairs, had the fabulous ""adios mother FUCKER!""  YUM!  Royal Flush.  then off to Nick's to Sink the Biz and gorge so much that I felt full STILL in the morning, sick!  Thanks for the company ladies!  But, I'm a little leery about the crowd in the bars, I think I might feel a little bit more at home at Bullwinkles ;)

The week was packed with a project, quiz and a couple of tests, but they're over and all finished successfully.

Before I came home, I'm back in Valpo, I stopped in Indy for a couple of hours and visited with J-man {(Joe)you like that?  I just gave you a nickname, hah}  Anyway, I had a great time, and adorably enough we complemented each other really well, too cute, us and our coordinating garb, hehe, we didn't get a pic though, :(.  Apparently, he wants one with our matching pink Indiana tshirts.  I broke down and got one for myself when I bought his b.c he didn't want 2 pinks, apparently 2 just seems too much, even though you're in LOVE with pink!!!! jeez!  We shopped a little, and went to Banana Repubic and I tried on these clothes, yeah, you know...when you know something looks bad on you, don't go out and show the gboy!  he def. told me I looked real bad and laughed, with no verbal cushion to make me feel better, hahaha.  Anyway, i.e. :  Girl in the mall that was dressed all funkified, he's like, ""What are you thinking!"" outloud!  he's convinced she heard him, she probably did.  Then we just checked out some boys together.

Now, I'm home chillin', had a little cell phone drama with my mom but that was over as quickly as it started.

I just finished watching ""Finding Nemo""...OKAY!  SUCH a great movie!  I was JUST laughing so hard, I absolutely loved the turtles, and I couldn't help but smile when I finished the movie.

and lastly, the reason why I am home...I'm gonna hang out with my sis and her friends in Chicago tomorrow night and then go to a Madrigal concert at my former highschool, to see one of my good friends sing, it's her senior year, so I'm excited.  But yeah, I used to do this Madrigal thing too and sing in concert choir and I used to be in the plays.  I miss it dearly.  I miss acting, singing, and being apart of something so beautiful.  When you're singing something so amazing, it just takes over and fills you with so much warmth...and to be surrounded by that...and to remember that reminds me how much that made me happy.  

Well, anyway, I thought I'd just let ya'll know what's going on...
sorry so long
love you"

"event","ok, I'm just taking a break from studying...
T-day break was rocky
After scary gay drama was over...the break got better

but it just sometimes seems that change is inevitable for those who can not let go of the past.

Although, I did learn a lot about my mom and how progressive she really is.  She knew a lot more about me too than I thought she did.  OH and turns out my mom has better gaydar than me!

and this break was also another reminder letting me know how much love is built and shared between siblings...that my manang (sister) and I will always be there for each other when times are harsh.

I hung out with my sis and mom a lot, more or less just shopping a lot and driving my sis to Hammond.

Really, that's all and I headed back here Sunday night.

What else...
my day is hours approaching...sigh, not that thrilled
I have a complex...I swear!  you'd understand better if I told you.

...and, really lately...this is my fault, but it's hard to get excited about anything...maybe b.c I'm in a routine and I hate that!  Sometimes it's comforting, but after awhile, it gets tired...the routine I've been in for the better part of my life.

I just wish it wasn't entirely my responsibility to make myself happy.  whateva."

Spending all of your time with them and getting up everyday to go and work hard and have fun even though others don't understand that it is fun.  Then it's over.  What do you do?  Still trying to figure it out.  Can't wait till Tony and I go to Florida though.  That will be fun."

"event","When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be pretty, will I be rich
Here's what she said to me.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be.

When I was young, I fell in love
I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows, day after day
Here's what my sweetheart said.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be.

Now I have children of my own
They ask their mother, what will I be
Will I be handsome, will I be rich
I tell them tenderly.

Que Sera, Sera,

"event","So it's finally here. The day that could change our lives. They get my dad from his room and take him in for his open heart surgery to get a valve replaced(for the 2nd time). Now you'd think it'd be easier and I wouldn't be as worried this time because it's happened before.  But instead I'm crying all the time and I'm just so scared. Maybe this is because it's the second time because they screwed up last time and stitched it wrong and now it's leaking. So I had enough crying today from saying goodbye to him this morning. What really could be my last goodbye. I'm only going for 4th hour because I don't want to miss calc. Hopefully Tony will come and keep me company during 5th and 6th hour because he doesn't have a class. Then my sister and I might do something, most likly.  She doesn't want to be alone either. So she's going to rent like 5 movies so we can watch them all.  Then friday I might see her too because she wants to get drunk and says it's fine if I go and she's willing to provide the alcohol, now it's just convincing my mom to let me. There is no better time to get drunk. ha. But it will just be tough.  And I hardly get to see my mom. She spent the whole day at the hospital. I got to see her for maybe 20 minutes tonight. Then tomorrow she's going in at 6 and staying there till night. Then friday she's going in early also and staying there late.  I'm just, I'm so scared. I really am scared. I love my dad. I don't want to lose him. I started to cry today and was during 1st hour. Everyone was probably thinking I was a freak and crying for some stupid reason. If only they knew. It's not easy for me. It's not easy for any of my family. That's why I'm only going in for the class that I need and my sis is skipping one also. And I guess all that I can do is wait. And so I wait."

And high above him you hear the church bells start to ring. 
The heaviness, the heaviness of it settles in, 
A mother starts to sing. 

Then it's one foot then the other as you step along the road 
Steppin' on the road, how much weight, how much weight? 
And it's how long and how far and how many times, 
Oh, before it's too late? 

Calling all angels, Calling all angels. 
Walk me through this one, don't leave me alone. 
Calling all angels, Calling all angels. 
We're trying, we're hoping, but we're not sure how... 

Oh and every day you gaze upon the sunset 
With such love and intensity. 
Why it's almost as if, if you could only crack the code 
You'd finally understand what this all means. 

Oh but if you could, do you think you would 
Have traded all the pain and suffering? 
Oh, but then you would've missed the beauty of the light upon this earth 
And the sweetness of the leaving. 

Calling all angels, Calling all angels! 
Walk me through this one, don't leave me alone 
Calling all angels, calling all angels, 
We're trying, we're hoping but we're not sure... 

Calling all angels (call all angels) 
Calling all angels (call all angels) 
Walk me through this one 
Don't leave me alone.

We're trying, we're hoping, we're hurting, we're loving 
We're crying, we're calling,

i just want to be alone but i can't bring myself to leave
hearts filled with pain and sorrow from past experience
tears cried every day the pain never goes away
words spoken when not meant picking fights to forget
it's so hard to face your greatest fears every day
so instead you let it sit inside tearing you away
and it builds up inside and you run and you hide
trying not to draw attention
so you fall and you cry and you scream and you die
making excuses to make it seem alright
but it's not alright
not it's not alright

I'm sorry for the way i feel i wish to god it wouldn't be real
But this feeling sits inside me, feeling of death, feeling of tragedy
I don't mean to aggravate you with all of my problems
But i can't just get over it and i can't just let it go until it's done
everything will be just fine yeah right 
when i'm crying at the funeral home will you be saying the same thing
i don't need your sympathy all i need is someone standing next to me
please don't say a word just be there holding on to me
 please don't say a word just be there for me
when i push you away please know it's not you
i just don't know how to express this to anyone
i feel helpless and i feel worthless inside horrible situation
i can't do anything i can't say anything it's out of my hands it's out of my control
and it builds up inside and you run and you hide
trying not to draw attention
so you fall and you cry and you scream and you die

"event","warped tour. the event i was waiting for. most of the bands were pretty good. the first band i really wanted to see was the vandals. i've been waiting a long time to see them. and was front row for it. they are so awesome and funny as hell. saw some other good bands. saw alex ogden and cody there. didn't talk to them but alex and i waved. there was no time to talk. we had to get to the slip and slide. it was awesome. so much fun. but to get front row for one of my favorite bands, i had to sit through the screaming girls during sugarcult. almost not worth listening to that. they are ok on a cd, but their concerts are bad because i don't like all the 12 year olds screaming around me. it's annoying as hell. i happened to look back and behind me were 2 other people. we looked at eachother and kinda rolled our eyes at the girls around us. we were not there for stupid sugarcult. we were then for the best punk band ever, bad religion. some of the girls from sugarcult stayed. i just kinda smirked at all of this. they had no clue what was comming. once the music started, and the mosh pit started, you'd hear girls screaming ""get me out of here!!"" if you can't hack it, then leave. i'd say they were my favorite that i saw. front row towards the center, it was just awesome. they are amazing. then we had some other bands. i went to get my bad religion shirt during NOFX hoping i could still see them and would only miss like 5 or 10 minutes, but of course we had no clue where the BR shirts were. so finally we got back and it was almost over so we just went in close for flogging molly. people started throwing stuff like bottles. one hit the girl next to us and her boyfriend was like ""oh i'll kick their ass!"" it's a pit, what do you expect. then one kid got up on another's shoulders and was asking for his shoe. people started throwing stuff at him. was really funny till someone threw a needle. that was a little much. then finally flogging molly started. i decided that i didn't need to be up front for them and would rather be in the mosh pit. i stayed in the pit the whole time. got the wind knocked out of me so that even today it still hurts to breath. but it was so worth it and it was awesome. only fell once. but it didn't matter. your in there to dance around and run into people and get hurt. that's the fun! then at the end, we finally saw steve(whom we were looking for the whole time). i listened to most of billy talent but didn't go by the stage. big mistake. i should have gone. i knew i'd regret not going but everyone i was with was still by the flogging molly stage. i came home and have been listening to them ever since. but thankfully, i'm going to the warped tour in chicago tomorrow so i will see them there. kinda a present for my sister from her friend and i'm going too. so yet another day of my favorite bands, vandals, flogging molly and BAD RELIGION! compaired to other years, this was pretty good. good line up. but there was something about seeing bad religion for the first time 2 years ago. but in total i'd say this year was probably the best so far. cuz i had 3 of my favorite bands."

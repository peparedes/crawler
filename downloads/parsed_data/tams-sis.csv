I now weigh 133 1/2 pounds and I have lost 19 pounds and I have 25 1/2 more pounds to go to get to my goal weight of 108 pounds since I'm four foot 11.  I feel soooo great!!!

Today I ate 1200 calories,
drank 8 glasses of water,
and did richard simmons 80's blast off.

I feel sooo great!!!  I'm so blessed and God is always good, it's just about time that I listened to him and loose some weight the right way.  I never want to be overweight again and if I can do this so can anyone!!!

Have a great day and don't forget John 3:16 because God and his son Jesus love you and you can ask jesus to forgive you of your sins and ask him into your heart as your savior and lord, and then if you do that and really mean it you will be saved.

Have a great day ya'll!!!

your friend,

For Dinner I had:  a cup and a half of carrots and green beans and that is 3 veggies.  I also had 2 ounces of roast and that is 2 proteins.  I also had 1 cup of skim milk (1 dairy).  I had 1/2 cup of mixed fruit (1 fruit).  I had 18 sour cream and onion potatoe chips and that was 1 starch and 2 fats.  I had 1 fat left open and so I ate a teaspoon of mayonaise cause that is one fat window lol.  I know to some people that might sound nasty to you but it was sooo good and I didn't cheat lol and I was lacking in the energy I needed from the fat that I was allowed to have lol.

I drank 8 glasses of water today and I ate 1200 calories and don't forget I did groovin' in the house this morning.  I feel sooooo great and I don't exercise on sundays cause I take sunday's off on the exercise department.  So that's it for today but I'll talk to you all later.  Have a great night and a great sunday and if you can make it go to a really good bible believing church tomorrow (sunday) and you won't regret it!!!

what's up???  Well today I drank 8 glasses of water, did richard simmons blast and tone and ate healthy for breakfast and lunch but for dinner at the movies, I had some snacks that I didn't need like the low fat candy and the soda that wasn't diet and the butter on the popcorn.  I am not off program just taking the night to enjoy a movie with a friend.  Maybe next time I'll do better and eat a small popcorn without butter and some water or diet soda.  Have a great day!!!

"event","Hey you all,
I am home again from work another day because of the snow and it looks like I will be home tomorrow cause the local county schools are closed and when they are closed for bad weather our day care is usually closed. Let's just hope so lol.  Wow, it is so cool how God is letting me take a little vacation here lol.  Praise God!!!  :)

Well, it is 12:15 right now and I am gonna go eat lunch soon.  But so far I ate a half cup of corn flakes with a cup of skim milk.  I am also on my 5th and 6th glasses of water too.  My water bottle can hold 2 cups of water.  I also worked out after reading the bible.  I did Paula Abdul's cardio workout and it lasted for 45 minutes.  It was so much fun even though some of the dance steps were hard but it was easier then the other paula abdul workout.

I got to chat with richard simmons a couple of minutes last night in his chatroom.  I came in when he was about to leave but at least I said hi and he said hi to me and I told him that I got back on the weight loss bandwagon again yesterday.  I hope he saw that lol.  I also met some people in there who are from the same state I live in.  I asked one of the ladies if she knew the lady that was on with richard a few weeks ago on HSN and she said yeah I know her, I am her lol.

Well, I almost fell out of my chair when she said that lol.  She is such a nice lady I can tell when I saw her on HSN and chatting with her last night.  She's a sweetie!!!  Then another lady came in the chatroom later who was on HSN last year with richard and I said what is this richard simmons and richard simmons's HSN cinderella day.  lol.  It was a great night and I praise God for all of the fun I had chatting with them.  It sure was what I needed since I am getting cabin fever here with this ice on the ground.  I want to go to the movies not work just to the movies lol.  Have a great day and stay warm!!!

"event","Hey you guys,
I use to stick to richards program like superglue but took a few months off, I must have lost the superglue somewhere but I think I found it now lol.  I started back on richards program today and I had a peptalk with myself in the mirror this morning and told myself that since I have gained 10 pounds since october that I need to get on the stick and start working hard at this again like I did for the most part last year.  So I got my superglue out and am sticking myself to richards weightloss program once again lol. I have lost 15 1/2 pounds so far on richards program and I have 29  more pounds to go to get to my goal weight of 108 pounds and I can't wait!!!  I bought tickets yesterday to go see Clay Aiken and Kelly Clarkson in concert in a few months and I am sooo excited!!!!  I've had a crush on clay since I got to know about him and since I heard he was saved.  I really wanted to go and when one of the concerts around here sold out in an hour and a half I was depressed, but thank God the next day I found out there was another clay aiken kelly clarkson concert in the same state just in another city so I got tickets for me and 2 other people in my family and I am so grateful to God that I am going, wooohooo lol.

Ok so this morning I had:

1/2 cup of corn flakes with
1 cup of skim milk.
I also drank some water.

For Lunch:
I had a small orange
a sandwich which had 2 slices of low cal bread
1 tsp. of mayonaise
1 ounce of low fat lunch meat
a slice of 4.5 grams of fat american cheese
with lettuce.

I am on my 6th glass of water right now and it is 2:10.  I don't know how to do the current mood thingy so could someone tell me how to do that?  lol.  My current mood is happy and I'm listening to my clay aiken cd :)!!!  There you go good enough for now lol.

"event","Well today I didn't do any weight loss stuff but after reading my friend valissa's journal I am inspired to get my butt in gear again lol.  A few times this week I ate really healthy and drank water and exercised once lol.  I know not good enough.  I really need to commit to richards program.  No matter how bad the kids at the daycare I work at cry no matter how much I want chocolate and no matter how much I don't want to go to a different classroom or any other place I don't want to go lol.  

I wish I could join curves but I have to watch my money cause my mom is turning the garge into a room for me and a few other things for her lol.  I am sooooo excited to be getting my own room.  They started working on it at the end of last week and my mom says that it will probably only take a few weeks to get it done.  I am so excited.  It looks like it might be a little small but the Lord will make it work for me I know!!!  It's allot better then where I sleep now.  I am soooo happy!!!!

Oh yeah you wanted to know what I did today.  Well I'm not gonna talk about healthy eating or water or exercise cause I didn't do any of that today lol but I did go to work today and this afternoon was pretty fun.  After work a friend and I went to the movies to see this awesome movie that I highly recommend called ""Cheaper by the dozen!!!""  I love that movie, it is so cool and bonnie hunt and steve martin are so funny in this movie!!!  Also Hillary Duff who plays lizzie mcguire on the disney channel was one of the 12 kids in this movie it was really cool.  I even got to see my favorite guy who use to play on my favorite show the gilmore girls he was in the movie a little bit too.  I almost had a heart attack when I saw him lol.  But he didn't look as good in the movie as he did in gilmore girls lol.

So valissa when are you moving here to north carolina???  My niece and I could really use the local support lol.  I hope I can do this program real soon cause I want to call richard next time he's on HSN and tell him that I am doing great!!!  I heard this story in this christian chatroom that I was in last night that this lady in the chatroom well her pastor was on this plane about 4 years ago and he was sitting next to richard simmons and was telling him all about Jesus and how to be saved.  I thought that was so cool that this lady's pastor was sitting next to richard and talking to him about salvation it was so cool!!!  I've been praying for richard simmons to get saved for many many years so I can't help but think that maybe it was my prayers that had that pastor sit next to richard and tell him about how to be saved through Jesus Christ.  And it was also really cool how I got to chat last night with the lady who's pastor sat with richard and I got to hear this really cool story.  God and Jesus are so cool I love them!!!

"event","Well when I woke up I went and had a half of a cup of cream of wheat with a cup of skim milk plain no sugar.  After going to church we went to the movies my mom her friend and I and I had a small popcorn with no butter, which on the deal-a-meal counted as one starch.  At the movie theatre a small popcorn is all you need to make you full and you really don't need butter cause they put a really good seasoning on it that tastes awesome!!!  I had a soda that wasn't diet which I counted as my 2 fruits.

Then for dinner we went out to eat which I would have rather ate at home.  I had a small hot chocolate and ate part of my salad and part of my pasta.  The restaurant we ate at didn't really have any food that I liked.  I ate some candy tonight but not too much.  I didn't drink any water and I don't exercise on sundays cause that's when I rest lol.  So I didn't do great but I didn't do too bad.  I'll do better tomorrow but I don't know anymore about doing foodsheets with richard simmons.  I think God wants me to save my money which is fine with me, takes the pressure off lol.  I hope he understands i'll tell him when he sends me the e-mail.  Have a great day!!!
Hugs and God bless!!!

In between my bread lol I had some mustard which I think is unlimited.  I also had 2 ounces of low fat lunch meat.  The meat was 2 proteins.

So for my lunch I had 1 starch, 1 extra, and 2 proteins.  I'm gonna eat my veggies in a little bit.  I'm trying to eat little meals throughout the day so I will feel so happy!!!  Have a great day!!!

"event","Watercolors are nothing short of amazing. I've been rediscovering them today. As well as listening to the new Jenny Lewis (Rilo Kiley girl) album that doesn't come out until Jan, but I have it. :) Its a bit more country-ized that Rilo Kiley but I like it. I still like Rilo Kiley more though.
fav song from album: 
1.Rise up with fists
2.The Charging Sky
3.Rabbit Furcoat
4.Handle me with Care
...a bonus is that Conner Oberst is in one of the songs.
On a completly different note I'm thinking of switching from ew-sucky-windows to Linux. I'm thinking of either Mepis or Ubuntu for a distro. Wow, I'm becoming such a nerd. Oh well, bring on the nerdness."

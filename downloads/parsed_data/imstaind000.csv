"event","Disclaimer.. 
We should all hope and look towards the day 
Where man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth 
Are mostly complaints and a change occurs

Say it, say it

Along you support
Then embrace another reason to see
Success we unfold
Clutching firm, betting he panics for sure

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done

The lie, want to know
Has it met, expectations so far

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done

Still running..
Never waking up to say it

Selfishly walking through
Killing the angles
Picking and choosing to
Screw all of us one by one

So run, make amends
Feeling torn
Boy, you better be sure

Still running..
Never waking up to say it"

"event","I can't sleep.

So my mom didn't pay the phone bill. Now I can't get online at home. Dial-up sucks.

I cleaned my room a few days ago. I'm a very slow cleaner, so it took me around ten or twelve hours to clean. Oh well, it was worth it. I love when my room is clean, I just hate cleaning it.

I'm heading to Minnesota with Squeaky on Friday. I can't wait. I loved the trip last year. I hope this year it will be just as good. No one should bother to call me (not like anyone ever does anyway), because I won't have my phone. It's no use having a Cricket phone outside of the valley.

My summer has sucked, other than hanging out with Squeaky and going to San Francisco. I kind of wish school would start again. There is about a month and a half left of summer. It just needs to be done with.

It seems to me like Squeaky is my only friend. He's the only person that ever wants to hang out with me. No one really talks to me anymore. I haven't talked to some people in weeks. It annoys me, especially when those people said, ""We should definitely hang out this summer."" How can we hang out if they don't even talk to me?

I'm gonna start keeping a personal journal. I've tried before, but it hasn't worked out. Maybe it will this time.

Ish tries to sleep: Take 2."

I had Fruity Pebbles when I woke up. I regretted it, though. It made me feel sick for a little while. That always happens when I eat cereal.. I wonder why.

I've taken up drawing for fun again. Last night, I drew Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII, and earlier today I drew Tifa Lockheart, also from Final Fantasy VII. I must say, I'm very proud of myself. I did a great job drawing them. I'm going to draw other Final Fantasy VII characters, and other things, too, which I haven't thought of yet.

I want to go to a concert.

I'm not getting a season pass for Big Surf or Sunsplash this summer. My mom doesn't have the money to pay for any, and of course, I don't either. I don't even see the point of getting one. Last summer I went to Big Surf once, and that's it. Huge waste of a season pass. I probably won't be going at all this summer.

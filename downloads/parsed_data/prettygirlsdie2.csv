"event","so ya. some people are so selfish and they can never be greatful for anything. and the person has not only been a jerk to me. i can name other people who he has been a jerk to. im not being rediculous for not giving someone a ride home, fist of all if its not even appriciated. SO THAT TELLS ME ALOT ABOUT SOMEONE. some people are just GREAT friends. i really dont know how i catch em'. and i dont care if im called immature. sorry that i have a happier out look on life instead of being all emo all the time. but in all honesty....that one person is no more mature than i am. he likes to think he is...but just cuz hes 17 doesnt mean he acts like it. AND THAT PERSON TELLS ME ""I"" NEED TO GROW UP....please. im not the one who gets mad over the stupidest shit. oh wait...im not emo. so ya i call that person a ""jerk"" because he has no right to act like that towards me. ive always been there for him, THROUGH everything. and i now know how my friendship is appriciated. by him sticking up for some dumb girls that i ""talk crap about"", which by the way isnt talking crap...its called the truth. plus they talk as much shit about me. but you know what....since my friendship is obviously worth NOTHING. that person can have fun with those dumb girls always being there for him and caring for him as if he was their brother. the only reason that they hang out with him is because they think hes ""so cool"". hahaha. but ya. i see the real side in that person. someone who use to be a good friend, somone who has problems but i was there to help in times of need, someone who has alot of good qualities in a person that not many people have. but i guess thats all gone now.....but all i realy have to say is that if this one person looks back on it a couple of years from now....they will regret ever losing a friend who ever cared so much for them....and people like that arnt easy to find....so thanks for having your PRIDE."

"event","oh man. yesturday was bad. not so much as one of my WORST days. but it couldve been if i was a suicidal person i guess. but im not. so yesturday when i woke up i was feeling down since phillip hadnt called me and i didnt know what to do anymore. later me, my dad, and vince went to the library by naylor and i saw this dumb chick there name patty with this girl that was in my english class named jelisa. well they were in the childrens book area and my dad wanted me to help vince look for a book. so i had to go over to where that dumb girl was. i dont like her and i never have but i guess a while ago we ""flipped them off"" but honestly who would remember that? i didnt until she started saying shit to the other girl. ya she started to talk about me (of course to i could hear) she was all "" she doesnt act all cool when her friends arnt around"" and i wouldve said ""fist of im not afraid of you little bitch, and i would break you in 1/2 so dont even start with your shit"" but i didnt want to cause a rucus in the library and in front of my brother. plus there was a cop there. so she was tell ing her friend how she beat up this one girl and then this other girl. omg. girls are so retarded. thats why i only have a few that are my friends. others i just wouldnt be able to stand being their friends. so i dont try, and then get myself into shit. oh well. yaso i felt all gloomy plus i couldnt say anything back to that little bitch so it got me all frustrated. ahhhh. so anyways i didnt really want to talk about that but i got a little carried away. it was about 9.30 yesturday, and well no word from phillip AGAIN. so i decided to call him since i couldnt take our relationship being like this much longer. i asked what hes been doing and he siad that hes been going to the moveis. im glad he can at least see if i wanted to go or at least CALL (and i dont kow who he went with!). welli asked him to come over, so he came over and i wasnt really saying much to him cuz i tryed to restrain from crying since i was feeling emo that day. so i turned and said ""let me ask you somthing, do yo even want to be with me cuz it doesnt seem like it"" adn he asked why. then i told him since it takes a fucking genious ""well i havent talked to you for three days and i tryed calling you yesturday but you didnt answer your phone"" here was his response ""i was at the movies when you called"" well he obviously didnt put any effort into calling me back , did he? no. ne ways let me put the convo me and dale had about what went on w/ phillip:
PrettyGirlsDIE2: but i just asked him if he wanted to be w/ me cuz it didnt seem like it.
mrtnvonnstrn: oh
PrettyGirlsDIE2: and he said ""well ya and then i dotn know cuz we dont really have much in common since we never really hve things totalk about""
PrettyGirlsDIE2: then i was like ya but there are things that i havnent told you and i know yo havent told me beczu we choose not to talk about them. and he said ""ya""
PrettyGirlsDIE2: then i asked him ""did you say that you loved me?"" he said ya. the i asked if he ment it, nad he said ya. then i asked if he still did and he said that he didnt know anymore
mrtnvonnstrn: well thats kind of weird
PrettyGirlsDIE2: so then i told him that i was going to be honest and that i liked him alot but sometimes it feels like he didnt give a shit about me.
PrettyGirlsDIE2: ya. i dont know what his deal was.
PrettyGirlsDIE2: then i asked him if he even cared, about us, about me? and he said ""ya.
mrtnvonnstrn: thats a lot of mixed answers
PrettyGirlsDIE2: then i said something else and he said well all we ever do is hang out here and thats all. and i told him that i know its boring over here but i dont know what else we can do, and tht i wanted to do other thigns.
PrettyGirlsDIE2: ya 
PrettyGirlsDIE2: and i told him that im trying (somthing he needs to learn)
PrettyGirlsDIE2: oh after i asked if he still loved me, i told him that when i said it back i ment it too, and i still do but he makes it hard for me to love him when i feel like he could care less about me. 
so then at the end of mine and phillips convo i asked him again if he wanted to be with me and he said ya but he didnt know why i felt like he didnt care. and i told him that it was hard to explain and im a girl and girls are comlicated. the i gave him smooch yadda yadda. then we just hugged for a while. but i feel a little better. i still have some other worries but whatever. its long so im outie. peace"

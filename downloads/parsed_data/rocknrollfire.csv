"event","i like how, whenever i've written a livejournal entry about something that annoys me, by the time i'm done writing everything down i'm over it and don't care any more. it's a great feeling.

i will say one thing, though:

comments about my weight in relation to my veganism are not only unwelcome and unnecessary, but when coming from a coworker, unprofessional as well. veganism isn't a diet nor is it a form of anorexia. 

yeah, i'll admit -- i first started eating vegan food to lose weight. and you know what? it worked. i've gone from a size 20 to a size 10 over the past 5 years (a good deal of the weight loss being in the past 2 since i've become vegan). i'm more in shape than i've ever been. i look the best i've ever looked. but that wasn't completely veganism. it was healthy diet choices, losing baby fat, and sustained exercise over a long period of time. no, i'm not thin, nowhere near it. i never will be, probably. i realised that a long time ago and decided to live as healthy a daily lifestyle as i could without denying myself the things in life i love.
this is why comments about my weight are unwelcome. i consider myself pretty healthy, and others would agree with me. 

and anyway, veganism isn't about denying yourself anything -- it's about celebrating choices that are free from cruelty to animals. have you ever looked at the ingredients list of a vegan cake? if anyone was denying themselves food, they wouldn't be putting out recipes for rich, chocolate-laden cakes. i could eat oreos and french fries every day and be vegan. that doesn't mean i want to, or i would, but i could -- and people do. i became more aware of nutrition over the years of being vegan, because when you spend a lot of time reading ingredient labels, you become pretty aware of what's actually in your food. but that doesn't mean vegan = supreme healthiness and it certainly doesn't mean vegan = thin.



additionally, yes i am sure ""quarters"" isn't spelled with a k. yes i'm sure. i will bet you $1000 there is no k in ""quarters""."

i kinda wonder why i signed up to be a western leader after today which consisted of me helping freshmen guys move their stuff into the top half of barnes. well... lines for the elevators were hellacious so i walked my ass up 7, 8, or 9 flights of stairs A LOT. oh but the best part was when it started storming and i got drenched (wearing a white t-shirt... of course). so then i had to walk up lots of stairs with wet socks and tennis shoes. not fun. but whatever, hopefully it wont rain tomorrow and i can just direct traffic like im supposed to do.

"event","IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT IF EVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES DID NOT PURCHASE A DROP OF GASOLINE FOR ONE DAY AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME, THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD CHOKE ON THEIR STOCKPILES.

AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD HIT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WITH A NET LOSS OF OVER 4.6 BILLION DOLLARS WHICH AFFECTS THE BOTTOM LINES OF THE OIL COMPANIES.

THEREFORE MAY 19TH HAS BEEN FORMALLY DECLARED ""STICK IT UP THEIR ASS"" DAY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION SHOULD NOT BUY A SINGLE DROP OF GASOLINE THAT DAY.

THE ONLY WAY THIS CAN BE DONE IS IF YOU FORWARD THIS E-MAIL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN AND AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN TO GET THE WORD OUT.

WAITING ON THIS ADMIINSTRATION TO STEP IN AND CONTROL THE PRICES IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REDUCTION AND CONTROL IN PRICES THAT THE ARAB NATIONS PROMISED TWO WEEKS AGO?

REMEMBER ONE THING, NOT ONLY IS THE PRICE OF GASOLINE GOING UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME AIRLINES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR PRICES, TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR PRICES WHICH EFFECTS PRICES ON EVERYTHING THAT IS SHIPPED. THINGS LIKE FOOD, CLOTHING, BUILDING MATERIALS, MEDICAL SUPPLIES ETC. WHO PAYS IN THE END? WE DO!

WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF THEY DON'T GET THE MESSAGE AFTER ONE DAY, WE WILL DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."

lets see... today... woke up on my own at 10? what the hell? anyway so i did laundry and cleaned up around here a bit... then watched sweet home alabama... then went to work. just got home. literally RAN from duc because it was fucking cold and i had a light jacket. lets just say that i never run. so yeah... it was cold.

ahh.... seeping into that tired old routine of school and work. sometimes i like that and others i hate it. havent made up my mind on that yet. well im tired and my back hurts and shanna's watching the o.c. so i think i might join her. later haters <3"

"event","::sigh:: im not in the mood for the redzone. it will most likely be ok once i get there. the hardest part is actually going. i think its about time for me to get a real job. one that may actually help me later in life? but until then i will do bullshit jobs and get paid small amounts. i hate that it will be forever until i get paid. at least two weeks, if not more. BOO. im broke. and i need groceries. i hate that theres nothing to drink here. it would be ok if there was no food, but i need beverages. theres no way in hell im drinking the tap water here. i tried it once, spit it out, and swore never to drink it again.

i decided 10 mins into my intro to philosophy class that it sucked ass. lets see... we went over the syllabus for about 5 mins. then the crazy mother fucker reads this poem and starts lecturing and whatnot. who lectures the first day of class? but i tried to pay attention the first 10 mins or so. after that i decided i was dropping that class and it would be a waste of my time to take the rest of the notes. so now im in a psychology class. but its a bi-term which doesnt start until march something or another. so i have one class tuesdays and thursdays. w00t.

ummm... other than that... it feels nice to get back into the swing of things. here my life is routine and planned out where as at home it was not at all. i like the craziness, but a girl needs some stability every once in a while. plus, i dont just feel like a loser anymore because i do productive things. which is a plus. i actually kinda like being back in my dorm room too. its weird, i know. but it just feels cozy again.

but i guess this is enough rambling.

"event","so... classes went ok, i guess. its hot as hell in here as usual. last night i woke up miserable because it was so hot. so that sucks. and just for the record, 8 am is way to early for me to get up. but anyway today i went to mass communications laws and ethics. well i didnt really realize it would be a class all about LAW. i mean, yeah, i should have inferred that. but i didnt. we're doing case studies and yada yada all that mess. so i cant decide if i will like that class yet or not... but it seems really hard. so after that i have my process and effects of mass media class. which im not real sure what thats all about yet. but it doesnt seem that hard. it doesnt really seem interesting though either. then came american national government. i might actually enjoy that class. professor kash seems really cool. he is laid back and funny and stuff. so that should be good. 

so after classes i went to eat lunch with stephanie, rachel, and a bunch of her friends. then i went to work to give them my schedule for the tv station and request off for the weekend of the concert. then i got my books. i hope i have all the ones i need. i was kinda in a hurry, but i got a book for each of my classes. that cost about $243. which is about a hundred dollars more than last semester. 

wow. this is all really boring. i know no one really cares about it because hell i dont even care that much. but now im bored because i dont really have anything to do. so im going to go crawl into bed and either read this month's cosmo or this book crystal let me borrow called ""he's just not that into you"". later haters <3

As you sit in your lonely cubical in the library, doped up on Starbucks & Adderall, you think to yourself, am I ever going to need to know this stuff in life? The distractions are tempting, and you have suddenly diagnosed yourself with ADD, along with advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage. I'm sure by now you know exactly what everyone is doing because you have checked your buddy list 800 times. Christmas break is just days away, and your Prozac prescription will be in tomorrow. So crack open an ice cold Bud Light after that last exam, because for most of us, Christmas will be spent in rehab."

"event","things in life are stressful right now.

things at work SUCK. so i called in saturday or whatever and everyone was pissed because they thought i was lying, even though they never said it to my face. so i go in sunday and feel like shit all day. whatever. so monday night was ok, i guess. i dont think im the favorite anymore. and i go in to check the schedule yesterday and im scheduled to work sunday, monday and wednesday night next week. i have 3 finals on tuesday 1 of which is over almost 70 pages of notes. so i requested off for monday night because obviously i need to study. so even though im scheduled, im not fucking working that night. school is more important to me than that job. and since i work wednesday night, i have to stay here until thursday instead of leaving wednesday afternoon. so im about to go to work in an hour or so and im going to talk to them about all of it and if they dont schedule me off im giving them the big ""fuck you"" and leaving. i dont want to do that because i like having an on campus job because it means i get to go home during breaks and dont have to work here during the summer and its  just easier. and if i quit there, then that wouldnt really work out as easily.


so anyway. some good news is that if i can make at least a 36% on my astronomy final, then ill get an a. so i most likely wont even study for that which will give me more time to study for western civ. AAHHHHH. i didnt want to get stressed about all of this but its slowly happening. i should just start studying but that would be too rational... 


um. i think something funny/interesting happened today. but i forgot about it. maybe ill remember and ill post later..."

"event","so this weekend should be fun... (note the sarcasm)

heres whats on the agenda:
-go to the ky museum to see ""abraham lincoln: forever free""
-go to the planitarium to see ""the star of bethleham""
-write a paper on the young buck/vibe awards stabbing thing (only 1 pg)
-write a book review of this book i had to read for western civ (4 pgs)
-write a journal that starts october 10th i think...
-go to the library with steph/take my book back
-read tuesdays with morrie/write a book report on it
-write about children of eden, ky musuem, star of bethleham

so thats all the school stuff. im trying to get everything done so that i dont have to worry about it over thanksgiving break. i also need to go to walmart and get some apricot scrub because my skin gets dry and GAY during the winter. i might go to ""a ten kegger"" with some people from work somewhere in between there. and i know no one really cares about any of this BUT... sadly- its my life. it always helps to make a list on here of the stuff i need to do... if you're wondering why there are so many posts like this. i might write about something real after i take a shower and before i go to bed. dont really know yet."

MONDAY/WEDNESDAY/FRIDAY 
(all in MMTH and Grise... in other words... bottom of the hill)
9:05-9:55 Mass Communication Laws and Ethics
10:10-11:00 Process and Effects of Mass Media
11:15-12:05 American National Government

TUESDAY/THURSDAY
(in cherry hall and FAC... in other words... top of the hill)
11:00-12:15 Intro to Philosophy
12:30-1:45 Business and Professional Speaking

so... hopefully next semseter wont be that bad. im really sad that I have a 9:05 class. this may not seem terrible to anyone else, but my earliest class this semseter is 12:20. so that blows. at least its practically right next to my dorm... that will help. im pissed i cant get my BCOM266 class because it will put me a year behind in all my broadcasting classes because the class that follows it is only offered in the fall. so that sucks.


but i guess i should go attempt to do something productive. shower, then read western civ, then revise and edit my english paper. looks like a fun night for me..."

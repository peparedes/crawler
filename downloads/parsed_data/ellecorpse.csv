"event","Oh my goodness, I'm having a marvelous time.

We're staying at my aunt's house in Henderson, which is about ten minutes from the Strip.  We've been going to all the casinos and stuff, which is fun, but since I'm not 21...*sigh*

At least I have Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney to keep me company.

Last night, we went to see a Cirque du Soleil production called 'Love'.  It was absolutely amazing.  The costumes were beautiful and the music was, of course, awesome.  How could it not be, when the whole show was a tribute to the Beatles?

Well, I'm off to play with Phoenix some more.  Maybe I'll update tomorrow, if I've got the time."

Even if she lives through her stay, there's a good chance she won't be able to go back to her farm.&nbsp; She'll have to live in a nursing home, and the fact that she won't be able to live in her own house is going to destroy her.&nbsp; Her and my grandfather, before he died, owned&nbsp;the property&nbsp;for over fifty years.&nbsp; He built their house and tilled the soil with his own hands, and just knowing that she'll never be able to go back home absolutely breaks my heart. 

I know that her death is inevitable, just like everyone else's.&nbsp; It's just that I honestly don't think I'm ready to lose my last remaining grandparent."

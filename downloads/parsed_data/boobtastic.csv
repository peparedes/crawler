"event","It appears as though this problem will not solve itself, though I am vaguely sure that most of these ""clones"" should have died by now, if not merely by merit of their own seemingly inherent stupidity, than by the frustrations of those they crowd.

I suggest that the Captains and Vice Captains still in full control of their sanity not only carry their swords unrestrained, but also take offensive action against the 'imposters'.

But on a different tangent, I've been noticing some strange goings-on. Oh no, nothing gets by me. Anyone else encounter a rather deranged-looking Kira-san and his rabid offerings of Mushrooms? Maybe I just keep having strange dreams?

Speaking of which, has anyone seen Hitsugaya-taichou?"

   Well I didn't write in here yesterday cuz I went to my boyfriends and then a party! Yes, if you're wondering we are doing good. I had so much fun with him he's just like the love of my life and I don't know what I'd do with out him. The party was okay I guess alot of drinking, smoking, and making out. I'm really not into drinking and smoking cuz it's bad 4 you but hey my boyfriend wants to mess up his life it's up to him not me! but anyways this is getting kind of old so I'ma go! Peace Out Homiez and Take Care!

"event","Hey Guys,
  Well today I did nothing but argue with my boyfriend like always! I made a dent in my wall. We almost broke up, but thank god we didn't! I'm just so mad cuz he's always lyin to me and tryim to hide stuff from me and then he said he doesn't have a life cuz I won't let him do anything! The reason I won't is b'cuz he's always hiding stuff and lying. We've been together for 3 months 2 weeks and 1 day and he wants to be serious but yet he still lies. Now how is a guy going to be serious and lie? I love him so much and I do want to be serious with him, but he's just always lying and idk it's just to hard to deal with! But anyways I guess I will go and write more in here later to tell you how me n my boyfriend are doing! Brandon babe, if u read this I just want to tell you I love you even if I don't tell you.Okay?

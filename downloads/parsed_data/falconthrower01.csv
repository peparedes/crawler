"event","Here i am, end of the week. I can admit openly that i've been an asshole to a lot of people for the past week... Especially to one of my close friends.. or best friend. I haven't really been myself. So for that i'm sorry, but i dont really want to talk about the reasons. If i've been an ass to you, which is a lot of people, Call me or we hang out and talk about it, or you can IM me and we can talk about it. Again this is to everybody, last night i almost completly lost it on someone.  So again, i'm sorry and if you would like to know, PM me, IM me, Call me, or get my attention some how."

"event","Alright, lets see how long this goes because i'm going to write about random things. The eating thing is fixed, hell that got fixed by my dad making Salmon and other good foods and i can't pass up salmon! So hopefully i will eat tomorrow just right  Hmmm... Jessica is home, she is the girl i like, she has been gone all Summer long and to be honest, i'm happy but i think i like someone else too.. mostly her though. So probably when i finally see her this weekend, i'll like her and only her again. But oh well. And things have changed for some reason, there is one person when i really need it that can make me smile or laugh. Now if you know me that's wierd because there usually is like two or three. 

So yea, still got something in my head bothering me and can't clear my head. I wish i could honestly but this one freaking thing keeps bothering me and pisses me off over and over and over. Only when i'm busy it doesnt bother me. So basically when i'm home from work and football it bothers me sometimes during both it gets to me and then it quickly goes away. I just push the subject to the back of my head somehow then. But when i'm doing nothing really, i can't. Don't that suck? Especially when i lose sleep over it. 

I'm going to like my next paycheck too. If i added it all right and everything it should be $308.25 unless the cost of living has gone up or something then it would be higher.  This might sound kinda wierd but i'm looking foward to school starting so i can be with my friends again all the time. Now we are all so busy we hardly hang out. Or they are all in Summer School but, that counts as being busy.  So anyways, i think my face is a little burnt maybe tanned too. I know the back of my neck is and my arms are getting dark. Thats just wierd because i usually don't tan either. BUt i guess working in the sun all day can do that to you. Alright well i'm off, i'll write in here later."

"event","For now on, i am going to stop talking to all the girls who have boyfriends because i guess it seems that their boyfriends get jealous of me or intimidated by me or something. Then somehow sometimes it seems like my fault for the break ups. So i decided, no more talking to girls who have boyfriends. Oh well i guess. That eliminates half the girls, wait no more than that i think, that i usually talk too. If you want to convince me other wise, leave a comment. And ya never know, it might work!!"

I dont know.. seems like friendships are getting shaky with people at the moment... on a bright note, jessica returns in about i dunno 3 weeks and everything, job ends this week. Then go out look for one during school. And yea.. things are going great i guess.. well unless you get what i meant at the begining."

"event","hey everybody, even though i don't know who reads this anymore. Does anybody? Anyways if no one does who cares... I feel like i need to vent somethings but, it's hard to because i don't want to cause arguements with people or start any drama or anything with them. It's wierd because i've been in one of those moods where i seem down but i'm not, well i dont think i am. Or do i put on a face to hide it from people? If thats the case then i do a good job of faking my moods because no one has noticed so far. It feels like i'm losing my friends slowly but i don't know why. If people want to end their friendship with me why not just tell me instead of acting wierd or having people tell me for them? Am i really that violent and scary to tick off that people wont tell me things? I don't mean or want to be scary or intimidating to some people. I'm doing football next year because i lost a bet with one of the coaches and i have nothing else to do. But ever since i've gone through with this idea or thing i guess, Kellie has been acting wierd. She is convinced that i will change. I know i wont. The only thing that will change will be a physical change. That would be me getting stronger. Nothing else. I don't want to change. I like who i am and i will always be who i am with my personallity and everything but her and some other people don't seem to realize that i guess. It seems that the friendship is falling with it too. At least i think i dont know. I don't know how to convince her that i'm me and that will never change. Maybe thats why i've been feeling down or blah or whatever. I just don't know. Everyone is doing their own thing like working and everything and well i decided to do something too but, why can't people like my decisions if they do no harm? 

I work now for Hillsboro Parks & Recreation as an instructor for their Track Club and it pays $7.55 an hour and its cool i guess. SO i work out in the morning for football(monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday) and then go to work later that day (monday,tuesday and wednesday). I know its not that many days but hey its a job and its an easy job. Lets see what else? I don't know really.. i just feel like i've done things wrong or being treated like it by everybody and i don't even know what i did. I wish i did because i would try fixing them. So yea.. thats my entry i guess... i can't say much more because i don't want to start arguements with anyone. And its just not one person in case if you are thinking that. But if you want to know if i have anything against you or want to talk about anything, leave a comment or IM me.. so yea.. i guess that's it for now. Oh and if you do read this, leave a comment sayin that you read this or just leave a normal comment so i know. Thanks."

Recently i went to the principals office for some odd stupid reason... i guess i threatend saundra's life.. hmm ok.. watever evne though i didn't Croley understood i guess... didn't really get in any trouble but ok. All i did was say tick tock a whole bunch of times in some e-amils and i gues the words timeis coming.. as in ya know umm Class is getting out within the nextn 30 seconds and i was happy cuz it was a boring class. Jessica is acting sorta wierd i think i dunno who cares... Kellie well i'm pissed at her i think.. also pissed at jessica i dunno its hard being pissed at jessica. Not mad at Monica though.. she cool. My dad is a fucking dumb ass. Sat at the school i dont know how long for a fucking ride from him which he never gave me.. long fucking story. So i was on the phone iwht monica and she decided out of her own good without me asking that she would give me a ride so thats cool. Last night i place 3rd in discus so yea... spring breka is next week and i got practice during it but my mom has to bring me down here to go to it. cuz michelle and dad will be on a cruise knowing it would fuck me over for track. But hey.. michelle hates me so its all good. So yea.. alright i'm not gonna lie about shit anymore.. honestly i think kellie and i r growin apart.. i dont know.. for some odd reason i dont think i can tell her everything anymore.. ever since that one incident happened. And I can't share everything with jessica anymore i dont know why. Its like now i'm mad at everyone now.. i don't know what has gotten into me. This is the side of me everyone hates. I hate this side of me.. i'm an ass to everyone. Maybe saundra brought this side back. I mean this side of me can't tell anyone shit.. i want to tell my Best & closest friends so many thigns but i wont... Maybe i am pissed off at everyone maybe i'm not i'm gonna go cuz this journal entry makes no sense.. got any questions Ask me."

"event","Hey everybody... Sunday i played football with my friends and everything at Hare Field. It was fun. Except untill i woke up the nextr morning. During our game i got tackled and when i did, i flipped and landed on my head/neck. I though everything was fine or kinda still do but, everyone told me they heard a ""crack"" sound when i landed. The kind of crack you dont wanna hear ya know? Anyways... its starting to bother me because ever since then my neck has felt so messed up and in pain. The back of my neck feels tight sometimes and sometimes it just hurts. The front of my neck tightens up or something if i open my mouth far enough. It hurts inside, like i can feel it sinde my throat and then outside my throat. I don't know whats wrong. I dont think i did any damage to it but, then again everyone said they heard a cracking sound. My friend that tackled me, Eric, got right up after me tackled me and was like ""Adam you Ok?"" He thought my neck got broken. Then my back is in a lot of pain. Its just pissin me off. My legs... well they have a reason to hurt... But anyways school is good track is good. Life is good. I'm fine except my neck thing but i dont know what i'm going to do about that. Any ideas? hmm well oh well... ttyl."

Ne ways.. unfourtanetly hit had ot be under sad circumstances.. but i think we are friends again. But i do gotta pologize publicly on this thing for what i have done. So here it goes...

<center>Kellie, I'm sorry for the things i have said in recently. You're not a bitch or a back stabbing bitch. you'll never will be. I made some mistakes and at the time we weren't getting a long to well. So eventually it all cam crashing down. So here i am saying it on the internet for the whole world to see, I'm Sorry. If this isn't good enough.. i will take you out to the public and get on my knees in front of people and apologize. you deserve it. </center>

There ya go. I felt bad when you cried on the phone and i found out i contributed to your sadness or rather i didn't help any. I two promises i made to you when you said that to me. I wasn't there for you when you needed me and i wasn't supporting you when u needed my support. So i want to make those promises again to you. I want to make the promises that i will always suppport you and be there for you when you need me. Hopefully you'll forgive me for the things i've done to you. You didn't deserve it. 

On another note.. School is going fine... jessica and i are close again just chillin and hanging out like we used to. I have the house ot my self later this week for 3 days. So i dont know what will i do. I'm varsity on track already again i know i am. lol.

Anyways yea today was great. Oh and last night haha i had Saundra talk to Kellie even thought Saundra cracked and told Kellie i was telling her things (which i didn't care). The point was.. it kinda looked like kellie was getting pissed hahaha. See I've figured out something... If Kellie thinks that i caused stress, well now i'm going to try to cause stress for sure!!! HOW ABOUT THAT?!? I got nothing else to do. lol. Did i say today was great? I think it was lol. Don't know why. Stomach hurts like hell and still feel a little crappy but MIND OVER MATTER MIND OVER MATTER COME ON MIND HELP ME OUT! Hmm ok all better.ouch still hurts lol but i dont care. i'm in such a good mood. No drama today no nothin. Without Kellie.. there is no DRAMA WOO HOO! lalallalalalalalalala. Then it didn't look like Saundra was trying to start anything so NO DRAMA! :-) Then oh lets see what else... Oh i dont care if people talk shit about me anymore.. so what.. it just shows your immature if you talk behinds someones back. Why act like i'm some big tough guy and get in deep Do do when trying to ittiminate someone or just beating the living pulp out of some one? There is no point. So yea talk all the shit you want.. be immature i dont care. ""I'm soo excited i just can't hide.. la la la la la la"" Don't know why i'm hyper but i am lol. hmmm well now i got a million songs going through my head lol why why why?

So its going back to the Dry Cleaners thursday and i'll get it back next thursday.. this sucks lol.... ne ways... i'm feeling slightly better i guess. NOt throwing up anymore so its all good. KNOCK ON WOOD!!!

The main reason i wanted to do this entry is because for some reason things seem different. I'm starting to look at things i see every day in a different perspective i think. I've noticed that for some odd reason every thing means or acts different to me. But in the past like i dunno 2 weeks, this has been happening. I find people more annoying then ever and i get headaches a lot easier now from people/things. Does anyone know why that could be happening? hmm dunno. Today i turned in my forms for track and stuff. So that's takin care of. it kinda sucks.. i got a meet on my birthday against Hilhi, what a present huh? lol. then a invitational meet on a saturday sometime during the season. Practice starts next tuesday. Yippee... ok back to why i was writing this... because of recent events that have happend, everyone seems annoying.. people seem not trust worthey and lately, i've noticed this since my last entry, I am an ass to people. I dont know about the cold hearted thing yet but i yet to prove that. Sometimes i wish a simple sorry or something to people would work. But then again sometimes i dont even think i'm sorry ya know? I mean i can't necessarly tell anyone anything anymore. I keep a lot of things to myself now more than ever. And when i go to school, i act like everything is normal or lie to people saying ""yea everything is fine, nothing is bothering me, i'm happy as i can be"". But why do i lie like that sometimes? Especially when its stuff i have to get off my chest. Is it because when i say things that i need to get off my chest it pisses people off? Like the entry bout me not caring about anyone with the whole kellie and I thing... I didn't mean to piss her off in a way. I just dumped it off my chest.. but then if i read it over and over, it seems like i was trying to piss her off. I mean honestly i dont know. My mind is just all over the place now and everything is being locked up including my anger or feelings about things and if you know me well enough, that's not a good thing."

I forgot how much my mom and step dad argue. but I guess its all cool now they are asleep. my little brother is at his friends birthday party. For some reason i can't what has happend recently off my head. Or out of it rather. I mean Kellie and i aren't friends, i've gotten detention in school, and i've been an ass to everybody. Why? That's a good question. One day though i was an ass because i didn't have any sleep. But for the whole week? I can't explain that. Maybe i really am an ass. Maybe i lie to people when i say i'm not and that i'm a really nice person. If thats the case then i am going to have to face it some day and come out and just tell people the truth about me... ""Hi i'm adam, i'm not a nice person, i'm actually a cold hearted asshole who you shouldn't talk to."" Am i really that type of person? I mean lately it seems it, honestly. I tell people i don't care about people. But is it that i do care about people and i'm lying and hiding it? But why would i lie about it? For some reason now I'm lost and don't know what to do anymore or how to think. My mind isn't clouded at all or anything like that. It's clear as it can be but, it's just lost. I have all these questions that i usually know the answers to. So what has caused this to happen? Do i really have friends? Or are people just being nice and not admitting that they don't like me or anything? Like i do to some people. See what i mean? For some reason I'm full of questions. I usually know the answers to these too. So what has happened?"

"event","You know... the past few days... actually in a way i think couldn't have been wierder. Well in a way. See Kellie and i aren't friends anymore. Somehow she fodun out that i told rachelle that her and Jb (b/f in Maine) should break up. But Rachelle knows i was kidding cuz i said it in her car one time when kellie kept talking to JB and was kinda acting Bitchy! Well so look it came back and bit me in the ass... but i dont care.. She told me the other night ""A true friend wouldn't have even thought it"" as in breaking them up. Well to be honest i was really thinking that statement. Now in my opinion on that, wouldn't a true friend actually trust the other friend? Especially if the friends know each other oh so well? I mean come on..Kellie knows me and she knows that i wouldn't do that. So then it got to the point where that ""you cause me a lot of stress adam"" Now wait a second, how do i cause the stress? i caused the shit between saundra and i and so so did saundra. But she ended up in the middle. I tried my best to keep kellie out of the middle BUT NOoooooooo she wouldn't listen so she gets pissed at me for not going out with someone i dont like like that. Then... lets seee how do i cause the stress now??? Now if i think about this right.. if kellie didn't do online relationships or long distance relationships, the strss would be gone mostly. SO WHAT AM I THE PERSON TO TAKE IT OUT ON? See if I had a g/f on the other side of the country i think i would be stressed. Trying to talk to her every chance i got not caring what your two best friends think about it or that they are worried. Then get mad and everything because her parents are trying to ruin it, I think i would be stressed too. See i've noticed something last night around like 3 in the morining, ok so early this morning, i realized that ever since she got on gaia and started having online relationships again, SHE HAS BEEN MORE STRESSED THAN EVER! See i wish i could have told her but i thought she would notice herself, guess not. Not only that talking to Jb has somewhat prevented her from HW in a way not much thought but still.  I mean, come on.. Kellie was a great friend and all and i wouldnt still being friends with her but i think after this journal i'm seeling this friendship forever to be over. Then what kind of true friend treats one of her best friends like shit and always bitches at them??? Especially when she gets mad at me for doing it to her. LOL i dont get it. Somehow this whole thing doesnt bother me at all... Seems she just used me for my money like everyone does. SO YOU KNOW WHAT? I HONESTLY DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYONE ANYMORE! I DONT CARE ABOUT ANYONE OR TRUST ANYONE.. IF I DO WOW YOUR LUCKY! No offense to anyone but sorry thats how i feel. Like it says up on top, this is my journal, if you are offended by anything i have to say or my thoughts, THEN DONT READ IT! alright? sounds good to me. Then she thinks ""oh i'm jealous of her and JB"" NO I AM NOT! See what everyone fails to realize i dont like Kellie in that way and haven't for along time and how am i supposed to like her like that if she was being btichy 24/7. It got to the point where you know when or if she did talk to JB because the days she didn't she wasn't bitchy. So my question is, does kellie think she da shit because she has a b/f? and i'm still single? Even though i want to be single? Cuz i found relationships cause DRAMA and nothing but DRAMA. For instance... Kellie & Stephen=DRAMA, Kellie & JB=Drama, Kellie & Landy=Drama, Julie and I=Drama, Anyone i went out with=DRAMA! GET MY POINT ANYONE??? See i can care less if i'm single or if someone has a b/f or g/f why would it bother me? huh? WHY!??! lol i mean come on... anyways.. i think i got most of the stuff off my chest that just built up... kellie if your reading this.. Sorry but see you wanted the truth so there ya go. Don't get me wrong i'm still happy for you and all but this shit o just said, i needed to. This is how i feel among things when i got done thinking about it last night. I realize us not being friends anymore is for the better, but then again, its hard to sometimes think of a life without ya. Goodbye Kellie.  

So on another note.. today was just blah. I didn't eat much if i did eat anything. For some reason my stomach is growling but, for the strangest reason i'm not feeding it or giving it a drink of anything. Dont know why. But honestly i dont care. Like i said i dont i care about anyone or anything, if i do care about you, consider yourself lucky."

And the way things are going or seeming, it seems like we might be getting close again who knows. The semester is over and i'm not nervous about my grades hopefully a 3.0 GPA will come. I think it will. Then i get my license. For some odd reason lately it seems like i've been going my own way on things and like i dunno growing apart from some of my closes friends. I think thats how i wanted it to word it. Kinda sad really if ya think about it. Dont know i wanna talk about with someone first before i figure out whats going on. I mean lately it seems like i've been chaning, my attitude on things have been changing, ME GENERAL HAS been changing. I don't think i'm the person anyone remembers or became friends with. I dont know but then it seems like other people are changing also. So i dont know whats going on. Like i said though i need to talk to someone about it. i probably will tonight hopefully cuz i'm going to my moms so yea. Or this afternoon so anyways i gotta go talk to ya later."

"event","hey things are going i dont know ok i guess. The other day someone i know cut their wrist. I am not going to say any names or anything becasue out of the respect i still have for them. I just dont get though why people gotta do it. I mean i know we all get fustrated with life but, to try to end it and not know what lies ahead for you? why do it? I know we all think about suicide but the one thing that stops me, is that i kinda wanna know whats going to happen later on. Then someone always makes me feel guilty as hell! you know who you are. I wish sometimes i could just take away my friend's pain. Most of them don't deserve what they are getting or how they are treated. HELL NO! No one deserves to be treated like shit. Or to get constantly yelled at by parents or have problems with their b/f or g/f. Why can't things be good? Why can't life be great? Drama free? How many people would like to have things their way?i know i would. But i guess we dont get what ask for. Or things like people cutting their wrists or over dosing or trying to commit suicide period wouldnt be a problem. Another thing i noticed is that, all of a sudden a lot of people i know are thinking about or attempted suicide. Its getting sad and i'm to the point where i dont sleep and stay up all night just thinking about it. Just asking myself why. Trying to figure out how i could help with thigns or make things better. Then i have to try to comfort friends or talk to another friend who is thinking about killing themself and try getting them to snap out of it. You know someone close to me pointed out, that if you do kill yourself thinking no one will care, imagine if there is an after life, you will have to see everyone suffer. SO WHY DO IT?! If you think no one cares about you... i gaurentee you, that you are 100% wrong... because someone always cares about you and not only that but, i bet there is someone that cares about you more than you know or think."

I dont think i really wanna talk about but then again maybe i do ya know? Maybe with just one person i will, maybe not. Its like you know got a lot of things to say and people say they are willing to listen, but how do you know they really are? How do you know they really care? How do you know if what you say will screw things up? How do you know if they wont tell anyone? I mean i have to many things preventing me from telling anyone. I want to tell someone really bad but i can't. Its like i want to tell people a lot of things but i can't. I guess people don't see me sad. And i dont wanna ruin their image of me if they like what they see. I know a lot of people say i can vent to them, but if i vent or tell people how a truly feel about things, it can screw up friendships really really bad. Then there is the anger part. I want to yell at everyone about something. I want to yell at jessica for things, i want to yell at saundra for things, i want to yell at little brat katie for a lot of things, even kellie i think i dont know. Its like a big weight holding me down. I just walk around and give the impression Adam is happy and nothing is wrong with me. Its like i'm not aloud to show emotion except for being pissed off or not even that because it will make people cry. So how can i be? I can't be myself because myself isnt a happy person 24/7. I can't be sad or angry because people will start crying thinking its their fault. So what am i supposed to do?? I've been working with Kellie to get my ego out fo the way. And from what i noticed, thats going great. I'm not as cocky as i used to be, well i think. But still the image of me and who i am haunts me at school. I can't change it because people assume they did something wrong or something else. This is wierd too because i'm the one everyone usually comes to for advice and everything. So what's wrong with me? Why can't I tell anyone anything? I dont know... but to be honest those pills are still looking nice, and that blade is looking shinier then ever."

"event","I got a question for everyone who reads this or doesnt.... ok ready? Whats the point of living or caring at all when the people you care about most want to kill themselves? Good question aint it, to bad i cant figure it out. I dont know what i will do from here... life is getting to fucked up. Everyone wants to kill themselves, everyone wants to end it just like that, all they need is something to push them over the edge.. i can't even help my closest s friend anymore i dont think because its getting to hard... i dont know if i actually help them or not. By the way things look dont think i do. The way things look for a lot of everything going on, it seems i am part of the problem or i'm just he source of it all. So i figure i can take care of it just like that. one motion of the wrist and its over. One more pill than i'm supposed to take and its over. So where i go from here i dont know.. if i post again then ya know what happend.. if i dont.. you still know."

"event","you know, lately, you can ask anyone, i haven't been myself. I can't figure out why. Its gotten to the point, where i gotta act happy or something. Or i can't show anyone how i truley am. Everyone i ask says i have been acting different or wierd or not myself. I don't know whats going on with me. Lately i feel like, i dunno. I dont know how to describe it. I mean when people asks me whats wrong, i gotta lie to them. I tell them ""nothing is wrong i'm fine"" or i gotta lie to them about whats wrong. I can't tell anyone whats wrong with me because honestly i dont know. I feel like, i'm lost or confused on things. Then the next second i feel Angry or pissed. Then 30 seconds after that, i'm fine. then the next second, i'm not. You get what i'm sayin. I can't explain it. I mean i can i think but i dont know. I've tried. I've been acting ""different"" for like the past month. I don't get it. What is wrong with me? Holy cow its freezing cold in Green Bay. Oh sorry bout that, the Packers and Vikings game is on. Now what was i saying.. oh, i can't explain whats going on, how many times do i gotta say that?

Then to make things worse, I had to put up with a lot of shit this week. Somehow Saundra got pissed off at me, and instead of telling me the truth and that it i hurt her feelings or something, she ran off and told Kellie and Jessica. That started a lot of shit. Then she told her i guess best friend Katie, damn i swear, katie starts a lot of shit to. And i guess katie didn't know the whole story. Now why would you only tel your best friend part of a fucking story and not all of it. Then you top it off, Katie is a loud mouth and likes i guess starting shit with people. I mean my whole week was ruined because of two sophmores. Not only sophmores, but girls. I mean holy cow. Then when i try venting or something or when no one knows why the hell i'm pissed at Saundra or something, THEY ALL JUMP ON MY ASS. And they only heard Saundra's version not mine. I mean holy cow. IT SUCKS! I just wish i could get whatever is on my chest off of my chest. I hate it. I wish i could tell someone. I've tried so many times, but i can't. Ne ways, i got people talking to me now i guess so 'till next time."

"event","lalalalalalallaalalalala i'm bored cant anyone tell? I dont really want to talk to anyone. Because lately, Everyone seems boring to talk to. No offense to anyone. Like today i havent talked to anyone. Didn't call anyone or talk to anyone online. Plus if i dont talk to anyone, i dont have to deal with anyone being in a bad mood or them complaining crap about something or someone to me. So yea i decided to take the day off from talking to everyone. My phone at my house hasnt even rang once, well ok once this morning but my dad called and woke me up, damn him. Anyways, its christmas break. Christmas Day i go to my Mom's House. I have no money to get anyone anything. i used my dads money to buy my little brother, my mom & stepdad their presents. And sine it was my dads money, he made me get a present that michelle wanted and i ended up spending more on michelle then my mom. Now i find that messed up. Considering she wants nothing to do with me. So yea and then i guess since i didn't have any money and instead of me just making cards or something for everyone, she got me a gift to give my dad. Some of my friends are expecting shit from me for christmas. Cuz most of the people think, ""Hey Adam's stepmom and Dad have money to spend, so he is gonna get me something"" WELL FUCK YOU IF YOU THINK THAT! They have the money, but i dont get any of it. Knowing them, they will probably want to be buried with it. So yea... anyways, Michelle is being her usual self centered bitchy self. My dad comes home and i asked him a couple questions while i was sitting in the kitchen looking at ads and the rest of the paper, and automatically since i asked like 2 maybe 3 questions,  ""Adam did you take your pill?"" Its like what the fuck? Am i not aloud to ask my father questions? ""Yea well your nonstop!"" FUCK YOU MICHELLE AND I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL! Anywho.. umm lets seee... i'm gonna go. Since i'm signed online and nobody is IMing me so no point of being online. See makes it easier not talking to anyone. Until next time.."

Well just so happend this guy that transfered from the school last year to some other shit i dont know, Miller i think... anyways dares shows his face around the school. I swear this guy is begging an ass kicking from me and a lot of other people. Personally i think he deserves death. Anyways this guy, Justin, i guess raped my ex g/f last year during school. And she didn't tell anyone cuz she was scared. I found out during the Summer when it was to late to do anything. And now i was going on thinking yea everything is ok and all, but nooooo. He comes back to  Liberty. I was trying my best to keep my cool and not just walk over and hit him. And now one of my other friends is scared of him because he has been giving her these ""looks"" i guess. BUt this dumb ass is asking for a big ass kickin. I've been talking with some people, and some people also want to beat the shit out of him. So what the fuck do i do? I told my friend William, ""if your going to beat the shit out of him, at least let me kill him or put him in the hospital."" I mean seriously what would you guys do? I guess he has raped other girls too, and they are scared of him to do anything. And when someone finds out its to late! So should i beat the guys fucking ass and make sure he is paralyzed for life or what? I wanna hit him. This guy acts like he is ""da shit"". Personally and everyone knows this, i can break him into a dozen pieces. But yea i think he carries a weapon of somesort on him to, so what do i do? i am not just goin to get him arrested, cuz he deserves an ass kickin. any ideas?"

"event","Another day of December, another day closer to christmas. Today was kinda a depressing day outside all rainy and shit. When i was walking out to the bus this morning... I almost thought the trees were going to crash down on my house. It was soo windy and pouring down rain. Then right as the bus gets near it all stops. Well the wind did mostly and the rain let up a bit so it was sprinkling. So yea today its just blah i dunno. Tomorrow i have a bone quiz in Anatomy about the ""Throcic Cage"" (AKA rib cage) Dont aks me why they have so complicated names. It gets frusterating some times. but i'm managing. Friday is my moms and stepdad's anniversary. So i dont know what i'm doing, staying here or go up and babysitting my little brother while they go out. I dont know yet. Today in strength training i was squatting 225lbs plus 25lbs chains on each side hanging down. So all together at one point i was squatting 275lbs. It felt good too, dont know why. But my legs were in sharp pain around the kneee caps area. BUt the rest of the lift felt good. Ne ways my teacher was watching my form and when i got done he automatically asks ""What is bothering you"" Now i never told him anything was bothering me, he forgot earlier in the year my left leg collapsed on it self or something happend. Anyways back to wat i was saying, he asked me i guess cause my face looked different while i was lifting. BUt yea anyways, dont think anyone cares bout that. Dont you hate when you want to say something to someone but you cant say it? I dont know.. i think it sucks... ok that was random... anyone still reading this? If not oh well i'm still writing... I realized the other night that no where in this house does it acknowledge My brother and I! Only in my dads office, which no one but family goes into. Majority of pictures through out the house is My dad and Michelle, no adam, no brandon. If it is not them, its some piece of art. NO why wouldn't a father be proud that his two sons are varsity athletes??? Kinda stupid dont you think? Every house i've been in with kids there are pictures of the kids on the wall somewhere in the house where people can see them. Why here? I DONT KNOW! Since i know already that Michelle decides where what goes and what goes up on the wall, its here deciding my brother and i are not worthey or important enough to hang up. SO its like, ""What the fuck? FUCK YOU, YOU STUPID SELFISH BITCH!!!"""

"event","Lets see... this might be confusing but then again it might not be. i dont know. Its wierd... i realized that the first time in a long time, that i actually dont like anyone. I mean i dont like anyone as in being b/f g/f with them. I mean lets see... Jessica.. well I dunno maybe i like her but i dont know.. after the mess that happend with her and everyone else how people were going around saying that i said her and i were going out when i didn't say that. That confusing?? i dont know how to explain that part lol.. have to tell that in person if u dont get it. Then Kellie.... ummm lets see if i dare try touching this subject again. Kellie and I, ummm her and i are buds. I think we are best friends. i dont know.. maybe not, beats me. Now that i think of it... no i dont like her in that way, i cant, because i always go to her for advice or to cool down or whatever i need and she always comes to me, well mostly that way. Sometimes i cant go to her and sometimes she cant come to me so yea. Like i said, i cant like her in that way. Then ummm lets see, i dont like anyone in that way. Its wierd, because i usually always like somebody but this is the first time in a long time i dont. Maybe i do, Maybe i dont. The thing is... i thought about this one night i couldn't sleep of many nights, If you liked some person for some time and when you actually have them, what happends if you get bored with them? Maybe you wont get bored but then maybe you will, and if you actually get bored with them and they really started liking you maybe loving you how would you tell them? You would break their heart wouldn't you? Maybe not all of the time but still. You know, maybe i'm one of those people who wont have a steady relationship in the future, maybe i will be one of those single guys that never get married or anything?? Cuz with these thoughts its starting to sound like it. I know I know i'm only 16 shouldn't be thinking of marriage and future relationships yadda yadda yadda, but yea its on my mind and i will write what i damn well please ok? ok. Anyways on another note, this girl likes me, I DONT LIKE HER, and she is always trying to hold my hand and cuddle with my arm and everything, so one night i told her to ease off because i have people like crazy coming up to me ""are you and Saundra going out?"" And i was like umm no.. i dont even like her like that or anything. so i told her to ease off and dont do things like that as much and she got all pissy and bitchy and shit and started telling people, ""tell adam he is going to get his ass kicked after school"" then they come tell me...and of course.. everyone knows you dont tell Adam that especially during the last period of the day( Not meaning to sound like a big ego-maniac or anything) but yea then earlier tonight she has one of her friends IM me and she said ""Adam what did you do? Saundra says she i goin to kill herself because of what you did with her!"" and i'm like ""WHAT THE FUCK?????"" you know if i didn't have a heart i would have been go ahead have fun in your afterlife or something you know cold hearted. Then she crossed the line by telling me... ""YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ANYONE BUT YOURSELF!"" and if you really actually know me, you know not to say that, thats pushing the wrong button right there. So yea, so i try figuring out what the hell was going on, but seems like Saundra is a big ass Drama queen. So yea.. i dont give a shit. I told her i didn't have time for her shit and left. BUt yea.. so i'm sittin here... bored out of my mind... so i'm done writing for now.. peace"

"event","ya know what... this is going to be some just random thing because i am just dead tired and cant sleep so i'm writing in this. This is gonna be intresting because if you actually know me, I talk about a lot of shit when i'm tired and a lot of random things. So yea... wat to talk about.... OHHHH.. wat nvrmind, i forgot what i was going to say. WAIT, i remember. Ok to anyone that reads these, dont know how many people that is, probably not many, who knows and dont care but still... Does anyone know what love is??? I mean how can you define it? Isn't it a matter of an opinion? How can you define love for everyone? I dont think you can honestly. Because dont people think of love at different levels? Like some people can be going out for like 3 months or something and one person as ""fallin in love"" with the other. While on the other hand the person hasn't... or he/she dont think they have, or if they do, how do you know whats the difference of really liking someone and actually loving them? Tricky question dont you think? IS there one honest answer??? WITHOUT LOOKING IN THE DICTIONARY! The dictionary love is just a standard form of wat it supposedly is but, i think love is something the is no absolute definition for. How can you explain it?? How do you know if you love someone if (Sorry to the person i am about to use for an example, not saying any names ;) )you find out the year you were going out with someone for about a year was totally fake??? How can some people recover from that? I mean first long ass relationship with troubles a long the way and no matter wat all of a sudden the b/f moves and she still puts up a fight to keep him. And how does she get repaid??? Treated like shit or basically looks like she got used as a doormatt and got walked on like he didn't give a fuck. And the thing is she is a great person. Can you imagine the damage to the self esteem that can have on a person though? I mean holy shit, no matter who you are, how can you do that to someone??? Then he always comes crawling back to her like, ""oh i'm sorry i did this"" ""oh i'm sorry i did that"" ""Please forgive me, i sorry i talked shit, i realized the mistake i had done or i just did"" and i can just keep going. At least when i say sorry to someone i mean it. And i dont treat a person i like or want back like that. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES you should not treat a person like that, especially a woman. I mean damn they really got feelings, and do you know how hard it is to get some women to stop crying after you hurt them like that? (no offense to the female gender)And if you have a heart... you would wanna kill the person who did that to them. ESPECIALLY if you cared about them a lot or they were one of your best friends. See you end up on my shit list if you  mess with my best friends a or the people i care bout most and if you piss one of them off, or upset them or do anything like that, you deal with me. Ask anyone that knows me well. you fuck with someone who is close to me or means something in my life you better run for the hills and hope to god i dont catch you. And you know what advances you to the top of my shit list real quick??? If one of my friends calls up crying because something their b/f or g/f or ex did something to them that was uncalled for... Then you will be really fucked if i ever find you. 
 
Ok umm lets see next subject..... see wat i mean, i write a lot of random things. Oh before i forget... GO DUCKS! Crush the BEAVERS! lol Civil WAR game i gues well yea.. today since its like 2:30 in the morning. Oh i got a topic to talk about... it came up during Health Services i think it was.. no wait it came up in English... Do you think abortion should be allowed?? Are you for it or against it? Why? Leave a comment along with the answer to the love question. ME personally i think have the kid, if a pill cant take care of it before it develops and its already developing, but dont fucking kill it, put it up for adoption and maybe a family that wants it and that will love it will take care of it as their own. Get what i'm sayin ok. HA! New Subject... Do you know whats crazy... when someone becomes really obsessive with someone else. Like if this one girl is totally obsessive about this guy or vice versa. Or if the ex b/f or g/f is obsessed with ex b/f or g/f. Everything gets so crazy and get stressful, because you ont know if the ex is gonna fuck up your relationships in the future. Or what can be funnier if your going out with someone and you start liking your ex again. I know its commin but when you think about it,  the current b/f or g/f must not being a good job at being a b/f or g/f huh? Here's something that can piss off anyone... say you just broke up with ur b/f or g/f and they have some of your shit.. i am going ot use me for an example (not real example though) Say i break up with my g/f and she has some of my shit and breaks or ruins all of that.. and on top of that my lettermen Jacket she still has lol. Do you know how pissed i would be if she fucked that up or purposly ruined it?? Your just like brought it to you or watever and just rips it apart right in front of you witha  knife or something??? Thank god t dont have any ex's like that... i just have an ex that instead for fallin for me again, she falls for my coat lol. NOW tell me how does that work??? And she is in total love with my coat i swear... and she always says, your coat smells like you, and i asked her, is that a bad thing or good thing, she says good. It's because of my cologne. I swear she is in love with that scent and the coat. lol you know who you are lol. Anyways damn this is a lot i think so i am ending it here before you get bored any longer and fall alseep. ~PEACE OUT FROM RAP MASTER AC~ lol ok ok so i'm not a rapper but it was a joke.. you know HA HA HA HA!?!? Doesn't anyone have a sense of humor, if you are laughing your cool, if your not or havent through or havent even smiled reading this journal you are an idiot. lol j/p"

"event","Hey everybody that reads this, I'm just bored... got in a stupid arguement last night with stephen and everything. You know i feel like kicking his ass but he is in New Mexico and the whole thing was stupid anyways. So i'm just letting it go. GO ME! Not losing my temper. Tuesday i did my job shadow with my dad's friend/partner Tony. With the Sheriff's Office. We were in the same district as my dad so i saw him every so often. BUt the big thing was.. We had a suicide up on the other side of the district and actually out of district so we had to haul ass up there goin almost 100MPH on a major street. Weaving in and out of the oppisite lanes of traffic like crazy. The suicide was kinda depressing but you learn to get used to it. IT was a woman and she shot her self in the chest with a bird shot bullet ( Like a shotgun Shell, Spreads after its fired, except made for pistols)so she shot the hell out of her heart and peirced her lungs. It was so bloody it isn't even funny. The depressing thing is last night, i pictured the woman shooting herself like a movie or something, some of this was in my dreams to. When i was awake i pictured my friends, such as Kellie and Jessica, shooting themselves like she did. Then i fell alseep after that cuz i had to get it out of my head... I was sleeping but i dreamed about people shooting themselves the way she did. None of my guy friends either. Only all the girls i know and that i care bout. I think cuz the person was a woman so yea. You get the idea. But yea it was so fucked up. I didn't get much sleep and not to mention i havent getting much sleep or not sleeping well or somehting for like the past month i think i dunno. Cuz lately i have been getting tired a lot earlier than normal or i come home after school and basically collapse on my bed for awhile. Which is not like me. And why i'm lyin on my bed, thoughts keep running through my mind about things. Its not like i'm sleeping or thinking on purpose. Just random thoughts about people and what is going on with everything. Then i like just wonder ""if this happend"" or ""if this didn't happen then it wouldn't be like this"" or ""what if"" etc. Its wierd i only have been doing that lately i dont know why. I dont wanna do it, i just do it cuz i'm so tired. Then my kneee is getting messed for some reaosn i dont know. I was doing squats in Strength Training and my left knee cap just gave up or something and my leg/knee or watever just collapsed on itself. So thats hurts every so often and when i do squats it can start hurting but, i have to keep going i wont meet up to the teachers expectations or i fail. So yea. NO doctors appt. Cuz my dad wont do anything bout it. and then i dont wanna hear what the doctor says about it lol. Cuz then my luck it will be really bad news. SO yea i'm managing i guess. BUt the dead body thing i dont get cuz i realize.. if there is someone that does care for you a lot but they never tell you or you know they do for example, your g/f or g/f, finace, husband/wife, etc. What good are you doing them?? You are just making them cry or depressed. I couldn't figure out why the woman left her husband after 27 years of marriage. No note or anything to him. HE comes home for lunch and finds her dead. Now what the fuck is up with that??? And it was obvious she commited suicide, for those of you that want to question if we actually know she did or not, it was obviouse cuz of the blood patterns and stuff. We ahd to treatit like a Crime Scene first to see if she was murdered. But she wasn't as we proved. But its so fucked up. I couldn't do that i think. According to the husband everything was fine that morning she was normal and everything. Even though she was depressed she was on anti-depressents. I guess we later realized she wasn't taking them. So yea, anyways, this is getting kinda long i think i dunno for sure. But i'm still going. Those images of all the girls that mean something to me or that are my friends that i actually care about, was disturbing me all day, they kept rewinding in my head and kept playing. I tried cancelling them all out too. The dead body didn't bother me at all, but its the fact i think it was suicide and i know people who are thinking about suicide. So now i am like ""what the fuck?"" And what about the people who just act normal and then one day they kill themself? Just like this woman did, seemed all normal and then just killed herself. But yea.. some images are getting out my head but not the ones of the people that mean a lot to me. So anyways.. this is getting long and i dont feel like typing anymore, plus i think i might be repeating stuff now. So yea, untill next time, bye."

"event","Hey people... who ever reads this i dont know anymore.... Life is getting confusing... I'm actually going ot use this again to vent out cuz its gotten to the point i cant even tell people who r close to me wat i'm thinking, or how i feel, or wat is pissing me off or anything. I don't know its like i want to tell them, but i dont. I've reached a point in life, where i sit back and think about my day and what is going on in my life with others. And when i do, i just realize life is nothing. Why not just be dead? We all die anyways right? Why do we have to wait so long? People screw you over a lot. Screws things up in your life... and lets see.., oh yea and hardly anything goes my way or anyone's way. I mean honestly if you are not rich, do we all get what we truley want sometimes? I dont need anything to survive. But honestly i dont care. All the shit i have... take it i dont need it. I've got ot the point where... i cant even figure out while people keep living. These days, school is getting very boring and nothing to do. I swear everything is just BLAH! its all becoming a routine. Nothing intresting happens anymore. Then when shit happens, it becomes a bad thing when it happens. 
Lets see what else?? OH now i dont know who i like. I dont know if i like kellie, which i probably dont, or if i even like Jessica. All i see now when i look at a couple is making out yadda yadda yadda. Then i ask my self ""Whats the point of a relationship?"" Right now its all bout sex and making out. NO one hardly now looks for a real one or it dont seem. If i have a relationship with someone i wouldnt just use them just for sex or kissing hell no. Thats like living a lie. i can't do that. Thanks to certain people i have a conciense. But how can people do that to others??? Use them just for their body??? Especially when a person can turn around and cheat on someone or have feelings for their Ex g/f who is engaged to someone else?? I dont know what is with me today. I just realized this all today. I realized.. that it seems, there is no point on living. Then i wonder that if i die or kill myself, will anyone care?? Am i a big part of someone's life? Would i matter that much??? Or would i matter enough to even have them cry??? Would anyone even miss me?? See i dont get it... Usually i listen to music when i get like this but... music is just music. I realized its just something there for whoever sings the song or watever gets rich off you listening to them just saying a bunch of words or playing an instrument. Its like they are rubbing it in that they can play an intrument or that they sing better than you can. WATS THE POINT??? Then when i sit down you know.. people sometimes say that ""no one thinks i'm hot"" or ""no one would ever go out with me"" But they fail to realize thats not true. There are people that would go out with them. Just give them a chance who knows wat could happen. Maybe you will fall in love with the person or not who knows. Or you know how bout people that are your friends??? Do people ever stop to think about that??? Or if you remember someone being an ass or something... And two years down the road they can change into a total different person. Well not totally different. But his attitude can change, He corrected a few wrongs, now actually tries getting good grades. If no one can notice that... then wat is the point of that person living?? If no one notices him or what he has done or if they even care about him and just talk to him so he doesn't feel bad. Say if it has to do with me, How would i know if i was living a lie. How would i know my friends are real? I would i know that anyone actually cares about me?? How can someone prove that to me?? Its kinda hard huh?I mean i have some close friends i think, but sometimes, that title of a ""close friend"" or ""best friend"" can interfere with what happends in the future. It complicates soo many things, doesn't it?? I think so.
Wow this is becoming a long one i think, I found out the other day, that if my father was shot and on his deathbed, Michelle wouldn't come get me or would not send anyone to come get me. And for all of you that know me... I love my dad. I care bout him a lot. Sometimes i can worry bout him too. i'm not worried he is gonna die or anything, but what kind of person would not tell the guys own blood, his own fucking son that his father is on his deathbed??? HOW COULD YOU LIVE WITH THAT????? THAT COLD HEARTED BITCH! OH MY GOD WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO ME??? I look into my recent past. Do you know how many family members in my family have died? or on the verge of dying?? The ones i love the most too??? Its like what the fuck? WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIVING IF NO ONE CARES?? huh?? CAN ANYONE ANSWER THAT??? I mean i dont see the point of living if life is as shitty as it is. I mean why not just grab a knife and slit my throat or my wrists? Or wat is stopping me from overdosing???  Or was is stopping me from shooting myself??? I can think of so many more ways to kill myself. And honestly i dont think anyone would care."

"event","Went to the dentist today, and i found out that i'm gogin to get my Wisdom Teeth pulled. Yippie... NOT! Kinda sucks but oh well.. I'll live. Just get put to sleep and wake up with 4 teeth missing out of my mouth. Lets see what else... Oh i drove my dad around all day today. Yes i drove all day. Then got my hair cut. Lets see, what else happend today. Found out that michelle is having some of her friends over on friday and they are going to make something in the kitchen, i dont know but she has banned my dad and I from the kitchen after 7PM Friday Night. Cant even go out to the garage to get a Pepsi or anything. But whatever i cant do anything about it because she is miss rich bitch who has to have everything go her way!! So on another note back in May my dad went to the hospital for a ""FOOT"" injury while at the rifle range. Being a Deputy Sheriff and all. Anyways that injury i found out today... Was just a tad bit more the jsut a typical injury. HE GOT SHOT IN THE FOOT!! Not only that, the two lied to me saying they dont know what he did to it, it just swole up!!! I got fucking lied to and now i feel really not loved by my dad because he told michelle, oh of course Michelle got called and told and she attended him in the hospital. I guess i wasn't important enough. If i remember correctly i came home from Track Practice, and  they came home a little later than i did without my dads car. AND I WAS TOLD HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE HE FOOT JUST GOT SWOLLEN FOR NO REASON!! WTF i asked my dad about it and he said ""I felt like you didn't need to know, i wasn't going to die or anything."" Well damn. IF he got shot on duty and if he might die from the shot, he cant think about ""tell Adam he needs to know."" NO NO NO NO he will be thinking ""OUCH!"" or be unconcious. Of course Michelle will find out before i will and i highly doubt she'll tell me right away like i should be told. Damn i just dont get it, I'm blood related to him. I've known him for 16 years old, I'm his son. His own flesh and blood and what is Michelle?? Another person he met like wat.. 5 maybe 6 years ago. So what am i now?? Just someone living in the house who eats food and has his own bedroom. You know I never used to worry bout my dad ever being shot on duty or anything, even though has been in shootings already, and now this comes up and i never get told today while we are at the doctors office because he had to fill out forms. Now i gotta worry because I dont feel like i will ever be told if he has been hurt or not! I feel like my own father stabbed me in the back. I mean damn. he promised that i would be told right away if something ever happend to him while working. Gets shot while working and does Adam get told.. NOPE!!! Anyways now i'm pissed... and i'm not going to take out my anger because there is nothing to take it out on. Oh Well... I'll live, i always do right? Anyways thats all for now. Later."

"event","Hey sorry i haven't written in this thing for a while. Just haven't felt like it I guess. So yea... right now i really dont know what to write in this thing. I mean there is nothing to vent out or say. Well I dont think so, let me think for a couple seconds. Nope nothing came to mind. Jessica (the girl who went Mexico all summer and who i liked before school got out) came home. It was nice to hear her voice again and talk to her. She has a real nice voice too. Don't know why i just said that but i did. So oh well. You know its wierd, when you are absolutly think about nothing. I'm sitting here listening to music and just staring at the monitor and trying to think about something to write in this and yet and i am not thinking. I try thinking of something and it just goes blank. Hmmmm dont know. But who cares. On another note, I don't get any sleep this week. Last night i went to bed somehwere 5-5:30 in the morning. Then got woken up by a phone call like at.. i dont know.. 11:00AM maybe, around there i think. Then tomorrow i got a dentist appointment at 8:00 in the morning and then thursday I got counseling at 9. I'll survive though. I'm one of those people that can stay up for a long time and then get one or two hours of sleep and get right back up and go. The only problem can be, waking up. Oh now I am thinking. My dad has made some stipulations of my getting my Driver's License and a car. Not only do i need to have a 3.0 GPA for the insurance reduction i need to get a job to help pay for it because Michelle wont pay for crap. No... my dad is on his own with money issues involving me. Yea Michelle can give me some money if i'm going somewhere but when its something i really want or need, she doesn't help out a bit. EEERRRRR. I dont mean to sound spoiled or anything its just you know she married my father who has a teenager and she decides she doesn't help out with crap. She said to me when they first got married and my dad was at work, ""Adam don't think of my like a stepmom or anything, just as a person living here, or a friend."" AND THAT IS WHY I DONT LIKE HER!! Its like she marries my dad and she can act like i'm nothing and my dad can't do anything about it because he is whipped by her or he doesn't give a damn about me. I mean sometimes when i am at a friends house, and i have to ask for a ride home because my dad is working and Michelle wont provide a ride home for me. Then i feel guilty or i feel bad for asking for rides home when i thought or was under the impression she was giving me a ride home. Besides the fact she hardly gives me a ride anywhere. I mean its stupid. Then the feeling that sits there, feeling bad having friends parents picking you up and dropping you off from their own house and Michelle is quite capable of doing it. Or i am under the impression Michelle isn't home so when i get dropped off and open up the garage, there is her Cadillac parked in the garage. I dont know... now i am getting pissed off, and i dont want to do that, so i better end this entry. Later"

Have you ever done that? I used to be able to do that all the time. Just get lost in my music and not think about anything just clear my mind. Maybe i'm still tired, i woke up at 12:00 or shortly after. So yea... I think people are right, maybe me doing this is a good thing.  Letting out all my fusteration on this, but I still think i need a punching bag. Lets see.. you know i hate August for one reason. Last month before school starts. They sedn hoem all the registration packets and its like oh great school is coming back. I'll be a junior in high school next year. In a way i'm kinda anxious for it to start back up bu then again i want my break to keep going. But school you see more friends, but summer you get more sleep.... see what i mean? But oh well hopefully this school year will go by fast... actually in way i dont want it to go by fast, I mean if you think about it, when you want a school year to go by fast, you want to get older faster and we all dont want to get old fast. Do we?? Pretty soon we wil be our parents, around 40 years old, counting down the days with our family. Scary if you think about it. I mean i am only like two years away from graduating high school. Then its college and then living on my own... i dunno i'm just talking about random things."

"event","Hey not much going on today. Not that anyone cares. I dunno i've screwed up things bad. I dont know how i can fix them or IF i can fix them. My friendship with Kellie seems like its ending. Seems like my friendship with a lot of people is ending. All because of me. You know I woke up this morning and realized that last night and for a long time, I've been i dunno how you would say it, there are a couple names people have called me and the basically all mean the same to me. They are... Heartless , Cold Hearted, Asshole, Jackass, Ass, Jerk, etc. Not to mention i've been called a liar so many times its not even funny. But you know what, I thought about it, i slept on it, and i realized thats what i am. I dunno why i am that, but thats what i have been to everybody. This last school year, if i think about it, i was cold hearted to everybody. Kellie kinda pointed out today, that i do only care about myself. Well sometimes I do, sometimes i dont. I just always went along in my life and when people called me theses things, I was like who cares i can get more friends or i can always get them back if i mess up. No I can't. That's what i have realized. I know it's sad you know a 16 year old is admitting to all of this. BUt you know what Fuck You if you got a problem with me admitting it. It takes a true man to admit what he has done wrong and to admit what he truly is. I would for you to walk down the street and see if they would admit half the things i admitted to, if they were. My head is finally clear again, well for the time being. I hate to admit this to, I'm giving in. I'm giving into the fact that i can't be myself around people. i can't be myself unless i know them. So i'm going back to the way I was, before anyone had a problem with me. I'm going back to being a different person for everybody i hang out with. I'm going to be the Adam Charter they like. I'm not going to be myself because when i am myself i tend to screw things up because I dont know who i truly am. And every time i try to figure out who i am, something bad always happens. So forget it, I've givin up, I'm throwing in the towel on this one. In case you dont got it yet, I'm waving a white flag, I'm surrendering. There is there another way to put that? Its gotten to the point where i cant even talk to anybody online because quite frankly i dont know what to say to them. I say sorry so many times but i screwed things so badly it doesn't work. I guess i was wrong the whole time people were calling me all those things. I can't get anyone back. I can't always fix things. This is the real world. This isn't Adam's World. The world doesn't revolve around me. It never has and i never want it to. I mean i would like it to, but it wont happen, it wont happen to me or anybody. But some people never understand that or they realize it when its to late, like i did. So i'm going to leave it at that. If i write in this journal thing anymore i do, if i dont... i dont. Personally i dont think anyone actually cares what i have to say considering I hurt some people with this. I dont know if you want me to keep going with this journal, just tell me."

I finally got this figure out. What everyone was saying was right. I just hope everyone believes what i put lol. Because this is the honest to god truth. Yeah i care for Kellie a lot and i always have and i always will BUT... i got that mixed up with other feelings and thought i liked her. Which is a no, she is my closest friend how can i like her thats what got in the way of everything that thought go mixed up with everything. Right now i am just feeling a lot of anger, which i need to take out. But i dunno how to but i'll find a way. It's just now i have to straiten things out agian with me and Kellie. That will be very very very difficult and even more difficult if she doesn't believe me. I know her trust has been abused by Stephen and she doesn't know what to trust anymore. But when you are having Jacqui (friend of me and kellie for almost 2 years!) agreeing with me that i have never lied to Kellie unless it was a joke or something like that it's a good sign that you can trust Adam. I mean i know its a mental thing but still you know you just gotta know when to believe someone. I've known her for two years almost and i have never lied to Kellie to hurt her emotionally. NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WILL!!!! Anyways on other things my dad wants me to get a job this school year to help with the insurance for a car if i get one!!! What the heck its another obsticle"

"event","WOW! I come home pull this up and everything read the comments and everybody automatically assumes that now they know me?? I mean i only know whats going on inside of me! Wait correction I DONT EVEN KNOW!! Everybody keeps telling me to do one thing or do another thing. I hear one thing from some people and from other people i hear a second. The first one i hear a lot comes from people and friends that know me and Kellie, sayin dont give up Adam, or just be yourself and see where that takes you. The second thing i hear is, well adam just ask her back out! First off it isn't the easy. I cant ask someone out knowing the person will say no and not even know what the hell i want to do or what the hell i am feeling. It isn't just love. Nah there is anger, sadness, and a lot of feelings inside of me getting mixed up and when the get mixed up i get all confused and i just break down and stop. No breaking down doesn't mean crying. It means i cant figure out what the hell i am doing. Here's a perfect example i went to the bank and to the driving range with my dad and i couldn't even focus on driving fully. I mean dang everything is clouding my mind and it isn't funny. Not only that, the person i usually go to for advice is the person i like or well i think i like who knows. Instead i had to turn and go to my friend Jacqui who i haven't gone to for a long time and you know what she helped with a lot of things i vented out everything to her not just my feelings for kellie but my anger, and everything else on my mind. But still you know what? Right now I wish i could take back everything i told Kellie about how i felt. I should of dealt with it on my own cuz now she is questioning some things. I didn't want this screwing up our friendship and I knew it would. But you know she asked and got it out of me cuz and in a way she had a right to know. It might not have been the thing she wanted to hear but you know what I got it off my chest Then i find out that she has been trying to hold some things back or something like that trying to prevent this from happening, well if she didn't hold back this wouldn have happened  at the same time same place and same day. It is because of the events that happened  and how it happened! Not only that there is another thing to add to all of this my dad and michelle(stepmom) are offering to pay for the both of us to go to the movies sometime from now through this weekend and it seems that usually she would say ok right off the bat or well question the time but still anyways she is questioning if she would like to go or not. I had nothing to do with the movies or anything i just got told this today and i tried making it clear that it wasn't a date or anything it was just to go see a flippin movie cuz my dad and stepmom are offering to pay. Hell why not go, damn it's not everyday they offer to pay for me and a friend. I mean take advantage of what if being offered. Thats what i am doing. I just dunno i mean i'm confused more than I have ever been before and I have no one but myself to blame for all of this mess. If I would have just kept my mouth shut or lied or something. No that wouldn't have been ok cuz I can't lie to Kellie. I HATE THIS!!!! I mean come on the timing for all of this doesn't exactly help with things or anything. Kellie and I have talked about things and i already know that we wont go back out and she is right i'm accepting that but its getting things inside of me straitend out. That's my problem and no one seems to understand that. i mean i'm not yellin at anybody or anything its just i dunno anymore. I just want a second chance with her you know cuz my ex best friend, Kari, screwed things up before and so did i but it had to do with mostly her and if i had it all to do over again, it would all be different. No more annoying bitch friend telling me wat to do and wat not to do, it would be my own decision on what i would do. I guess we'll never know cuz it wont happen. But hey it's the decision Kellie has made i have to live with it. I'm already living with that decision that she made, I may not like her decision but you know what knowing Kellie she is making this decision for the good. Every decision she makes she usually thinks about and turns out it was for the best for the people involved in it. I dunno i will just lock away all my feelings and anger again and never see them again. AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! You know its this stuff (my anger, my feelings, my emotions etc.) that i put away inside of me and store it somewhere and forget about it. Then the anger and rage gets taken out when I get in a fight at school or when I take it out whenever I am pissed. These are the kind of things that cause me to get mad at random reasons because the anger doesn't go anywhere, it stays inside of me just all locked away. Then at random times it just gets taken out on random people and its unfair to the people I take it out on. I don't know like right now i am frusterated with myself for everything and i started writing this out acting like i was yelling at people for writing comments about my enrties. I dont want anyone to stop reading this or commenting. I kinda like it when people comment on my entries. I know people are just trying to help but i just have to express my self you know?? I'm not sure about anything anymore honestly. I'm sorry if this sounds like i am trying to piss anyone off or if it doesn't or if i'm singling some people out, which i am not. Cuz of what people are saying it's helping sort out things. I mean I do care for Kellie a lot and i always have and maybe i am getting it mixed up with other feelings. I'm just trying to figure out how to release my frustration inside of me and quit frankly this is the only way i can think of right now and you know some of this shows me going from calm to angry just like that if u look at it carefully. I dont know what the hell is wrong with me and i wish i did and hopefully it will soon be over with. Well i think i wrote enough for right now but if I feel like writing more later I will."

"event","you know this sucks when you think you forget about something or you fixed something it always comes back. Yesterday i hung out with Kellie because Stephen broke up with her and she needed someone there cuz she was cryin and yea i was there for support. Anyways later on in the day we went out on a walk and i saw something i havent seen for a long time. See when Stephen and Kellie went out I swear Kellie was a different person sometimes i dunno... but i had no feelings for her but as only as a friend. When i went on the walk with her and we sat out on the curb talking last night like we sometimes do, just to talk, I noticed that she was kinda acting like her old self. The one i really liked when i first met her. I dunno i thought i burried and locked these feelings up for good. But no its like she has unlocked them again. I dunno. Its wierd. When we first went out i screwed things up a lot, so she broke up with me. But a back stabbing b*tch best friend who manipulated me and controlled the hell out of me. And she screwed things up a lot. Now i dont have her as a friend and sometimes i feel like i deserve a second chance. But then again i don't deserve one. I dunno but i am really starting to hate mixed feelings. I've talked to kellie bout this already and she said it was funny how my feelings are crazy or out of control, or something like that. I just don't know honestly. When i got home last night, it ate me up inside just like that, quicker than anything has before. I mean yea i have liked girls in the past but dang this sucks. I mean here i am liking my ex/ really close friend who just broke up with her ex and all of this sounds wrong you know with the timing and everything but i dont know how it happend i just dont honestly know. No i am not taking advantage of her and stephen breaking up. NO there is no freakin way. I mean i've told everyone i didn't like her in that way so many times and yet last night that little lock got unlocked by her and my feelings for her came flying out again. EEEERRRRRRRRRRRR i hate this! I dunno but i just woke up and i am tired as hell. So i figured i would write this cuz if i didn't write it now i would have never wrote it. I might write in this later today if something comes up."

"event","Oh boy am i pissed. My friend Kellie's b/f just broke up with her and she is ballin her eyes out. It makes no since either cuz personally i think its a big mistake breaking up with her who knows. I'm at her house cuz she called me cryin and i came runnign over here. Supposly he is going to go back out with his ex. If that happends he better hope i dont see him again cuz i would lose it. My anger would come out and be taken out. I dont know on who. But damn. I dont know i have never seen anyone cry this much. She really loved stephen and now its over. I dunno, but hey at least i am here for support. That is all she needs right now is support. Its kinda wierd your ex g/f getting support from her ex. lol. Well i hear her laughing now, i guess thats a good sign. I hope. I dunno. But this is getting messed up. She doesn't deserve to go through what she has. Her b/f and her have been goin out for 10 months. And the shit they went through was like WOW! i thought it would go a lot longer... But i dont just get why he has to break up with her while in New Mexico, when they talked about it when he lived here. I JUST DONT GET IT!!!! Plus the fact i heard when i got here is that he is breaking up with her to go back to his ex... WHAT THE FUCK... i dun no personally this world can be cruel and very fucking unfair sometimes in my eyes. Ok i'm going to stop now cuz personally i dont know what i am saying lol."

"event","Hey well everything i guess got cleared up, i think. I went ot the fair last night cuz my friend Daniela called me up and asked if i wanna go so i went with her. She asked me if i've heard from Jessica(the girl i like) cuz she is down in Mexico. i told her no which is true. She has been gone all summer long and wont come home for a couple more weeks i think. Anyways talkin about her just made me angry cuz i couldn't see her or be with her anymore. She knows i like her and  when we talk its lots of fun. Talking bout her brought back up some anger.. so i had to burn it off in the gym... hold up phone! Ok so anyways yea i came home from the gym didn't get it all out of me so i took it out on kellie, it didn't bother me at the time. but after.. i felt bad doing it. You know i swear she can put the biggest guilt trip on me. Its kinda funny sometimes. lol.  Anyways friend has a problem and on the phone with her. I'll write back later tonight or tomorrow."

"event","I really found the assertiveness course quite an eye-opener. Not in terms of work, in fact I came across as being assertive and positive in the work-place. 

In my personal life though, the ""manipulative"" behaviour traits came out especially as being a strong part of my personality and I was wincing at the accurate description of how I lead my personal life!

I think, though, I've taken away some good ideas and terminology of how to get what I want without treading on other people's toes to get it. Or that's the idea. And some indicators of how not to be ruled solely by my emotions and gut reactions, too.

The thing coincided with what is meant to be a ""new start"" for Michael and I, I guess triggered by Dubai chappie incident. I don't want to go into details really, as part of the assertiveness course emphasised not saying behind people's backs, what you wouldn't say to their face. Suffice to say that we are talking *only that* and at the moment I am finding it painful, but am managing to keep hold of my emotions, which is a big big achievement for me!

Whether the whole thing is worth it is yet to be seen. I'm still holding out for meeting a Portillo-lookalike millionaire who loves Civil War re-enactment and looking after toddlers ... by serendipity ...

Well, one can dream!

PS I heard a song on Radio 1 today, that was sort of poppy but sort of electro too and it went ""something kinda ooooooooh"". But I don't know what it was or if one can download it. All help welcome!"

"event","Well, the weekend was weird! (So weird, it's taken until Wednesday to write about it here...)

It seems I totally got the wrong end of the stick with Dubai chappie. Well, not quite. We both went to work do on Friday night and drank far too much (everyone did! Work provides us with far too much free alcohol!) Daughter was with her Aunt for the night, so I was a free bird, but not sure whether that was good. I ended up far away from work do, in the Hatchet with our head of Project Management (and Sam). Strange, strange...

Anyway, turns out Dubai chappie is not in the running for a relationship, apart from the physical side nudge nudge wink wink. Anyway, we had an honest chat and I'm not sad we're not taking things any further, on getting to know each other better I think we were not really compatible...

After this turmoil I had a lovely weekend with Parents, and Daughter, beautifully relaxing.... and we sang lots of songs from Oliver! ... I like that...

Got back to work and had a strange, heart-to-heart with Michael. Very strange, but the outcome - for now - is that I am going to look into cognitive behavioural therapy techniques. I think they can help me overcome some of the problems I've had with relationships (private and professional) in the past and at the moment, so although it feels weird, I'm actually feeling strangely positive. I wouldn't have thought Michael would be the person to help me through this stuff, though. That makes no sense."

"event","Well, it's the end of another week and I am knackered and looking forward to a big long sleep and some lie-ins this weekend (visiting Parents again, is Mum's birthday... Should be lots of fun).

Work has been good this week. I'm now officially a quality engineer. So exciting. We also had an external audit which we passed with flying colours, I got lots of praise so I do think that this career change is the right one for me (no more finite element analysis will be weird, but I think I'll be putting my brain to good use).

Have been listening to a lot of 80s stuff this week. And Suzi Quatro. I didn't realise I had mp3s of her, but I do, just a few. They're on my iPod now and cheer me up on the way to work. Hooray.

I didn't do that big blog thing. I wanted to, but I was a bit knackered on Tuesday, and I got confused by the way in which you were meant to include the way history impinged on your life, or something. I don't want to write fake blogs - I want to write what's in my head, not something prescribed. And history does impinge on my life a lot - but I don't always want to blog about it... anyway rant over! 

I need to ask purple pen how to link to live journal people in one's entries! Am so bad at IT it hurts.

"event","Back home again, this time after a weekend with Mum and Daughter in Birmingham. Quite relaxing and lots of fun! We watched Strictly come Dancing and Daughter copied every dance in her Halloween ""pumpkin"" dress (It is not really a pumpkin but just a green and orange ballet style dress). Yet again I am getting strangely addicted to the programme, it is interesting to watch the people working so hard to try and dance well (as opposed to crap celebrity programmes like love island where they just sit around). Then we also watched Robin Hood (Guy of Gisburne far more charismatic, to my mind, than the guy(!) who plays Robin - he's not sexy at all).

And yesterday we watched the end of Jane Eyre (slightly over-egged ending? I think so, but the rest was good). So really far too much TV-watching going on for our own good.

Today a baby-orientated day with toddler group, lunch out and doing of Noddy jigsaw puzzle. Rather a gloomy picture, it is Noddy and policeman gloating over having put two sad elves behind bars, and fastened same with a giant gold padlock. Moral of the picture seems to be if you are fat you're OK, if you're thin you're definitely a bit dodgy...

Not much update with nice guy from work, although he *did* leave me his mobile number in a post it on my computer his last night in the office after I'd gone home, with ""Keep in touch"" written beneath, and we've texted since. But he's abroad in a few days, so if we are to make a friendship it will have to be totally texts and email, unless I should get to go out there with work. Oh well, it was a nice evening!"

A lovely night on Friday - some colleagues' ""leaving"" does all wrapped into one on the Gloucester Road. Only one is actually leaving. Another transfers to another department and another seconded abroad for 6 months. Had a VERY good time with the colleague who's about to be seconded abroad, great timing eh! Still we will see.

Then Sister's birthday party on Saturday, again along the Gloucester Road. Lots of yummy buffet food then back to hers for yet more food (Sam to blame :D ) and a look at ""amusing shop fronts"" book which was her present. The best shop title ""Tanya Hyde"" no, not an S&M shop. A Tanning salon :)"

"event","I've been watching lots of Bullseye on challenge tv this week. (Although yesterday challenge tv went down and all you got was a picture saying ""We currently have technical problems, the show will go on... shortly!"" So not only are half the programmes on there from the 1980s, the service is too :) )

They generally put on one show of Old Bullseye before one show of New Bullseye. New Bullseye is a sort of cut price thing, Jim Bowen doesn't present it any more (it is strange chappie from Phoenix Nights instead), but Tony Green the umpire/commentator is still there. But the star prize is not so good, I think I've seen a leather suite, and a hot tub available. Mind you in the 1980s it was always a boat, which is not that great either (and how do the winners split it between them?)

They also have some incredibly post-modern ""innuendo"" thing going on when they describe the prizes on Bully's prize board round, i.e. ""Waggle your joystick back and forth with this Atari games console"", ""Give her the ride of her life with this pair of Raleigh mountain bikes"" etc etc, and also one of the prizes was a Corby trouser press which I always thought you could only get in hotels.

But still! Old or new Bullseye is still better than most of the other stuff on my cable TV ..."

"event","Well, I'm back home after an eventful, but good weekend, singing my heart out!

It all started on Thursday after work when Daughter and I headed up to Birmingham so she could be dropped off with the devoted grandparents - not the most relaxing of car journeys, as I had the choice between Daughter's tantrums, and putting ""Show me the way to Amarillo"" on repeat play to keep her quiet! Tony Christie was judged as the least discordant option, but only just...

After a jolly evening catching up with my parents, it was off to Cumbria to sing the next day. I managed to cover the 8 million miles on the M6 fine, no traffic jams, but coming off the motorway was a bit of a problem, as my map book seems to have given up on actually naming any roads or towns north of Carlisle. I rang up Michael at work and he directed me part of the way from multimap, but then I got out of mobile phone reception..... I eventually got to the village where my inn was, the village consisted of the inn. And it was closed.

Things did get better! I found the singing course venue and was warmly welcomed by Abbie, the main teacher, and the other course attendees. In due course Maddy and her daughter also turned up and we all started singing. We started with lots of basic relaxation and breathing exercises, which I really needed. Then more singing - lots of chat - and the rather lucky revelation that we were eating that night at my inn (supposing it was open!!!) - so I could have a glass or two of wine, and not have to drive.

Finally found the inn landlord who showed me to a surprisingly nice room (next to a TV room where I got to see the final of masterchef! boo I wanted Hardeep to win!) and basically a lovely evening, getting merry and annoying the locals by singing folk songs till 1am!

Saturday was more intensive singing practice, mostly focusing on breathing again, and also on listening rather than pushing one's own voice forwards - important for singing group harmonies, apparently, and again very good advice. We also enjoyed lots of lovely food prepared by Maddy's own fair hand - and after dinner she graciously sang for us, which for me was the high point of the weekend (She didn't sing All Around My Hat, though. Boo.) 

The inn's Leek Club was holding a giant leek competition, too. I've never seen a bigger leek! - and one of the prizes was a cupboard with a naked woman carved into one of the doors...

Sunday we tackled (and I think did well at) some more complex songs, then I had a lovely chat with Maddy, and then it was a quick lunch and off home (with a big hug from Maddy too!). I've attached the picture of all the dudes on the course below, but I've put it in a gallery also! I was a bit apprehensive of playing all my Steeleye Span songs in the car now that I'd met Maddy and knew her as a real idiosyncratic woman rather than a folk-rock idol - but actually the songs seemed even better! So hooray, and I can't wait until I see SS in December.

"event","Well here it is - my first post on livejournal!

I hope to use this as a general sounding board for my thoughts and ideas, as well as being able to look back in later days to see what I was up to in 2006 :D

I had a reasonably jolly day today. My line manager is trying to facilitate my move from being a technical worker (engineer) to management (quality assurance/auditing). It's what I love and am good at but very few people in our company can escape stress calculations and finite element analysis completely - so if I pull it off I will be very pleased with myself... Fingers crossed! I've been as nervous today as if I were in a job interview, which I guess is what in effect it was.

Picked Daughter up and had an intellectual conversation in the car as to the difference between fences and gates, because she saw a paper cup on the top of a ""gate"" - which was actually the local primary school's fence... Consensus is that gates open and fences don't. We saw some great gates on the way home.

I'm going on a singing course tomorrow, led by Maddy Prior, the singer out of Steeleye Span! It's situated in a remote barn in Cumbria, and I fear that my time will be spent a) trying to avoid becoming star-struck by the fact I'm working with Maddy and b) attempting to hide the fact that I'm actually quite a poor singer. Still, it's a long-anticipated holiday for me (Daughter will be visiting the sights of Birmingham with her grandparents whilst I'm away singing) so I'm determined to enjoy it and not be scared... Actually I'm really looking forward to it! Apparently she cooks great pies...

And Michael took me shopping today for my new autumn ensemble. Good, I say."

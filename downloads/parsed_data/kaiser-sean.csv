<b>Companion Guide to Meteors</b> 
<i>Facts you may not know</i>

Get excited, kids. Now. 

Ok, good. Now that you're excited, I'll tell you why you're excited. It's meteor mating season. 

That's right. Take it easy. Everyone calm down. Meteor mating season is a sight to behold! Meteors get it on only once every four years. They do not mate for life, which is a common misconception about meteors. Meteor sex is scientifically known as <b><i>docking</i></b>. While hanging out, possibly watching the game, male meteors have been known to make innuendos such as ""I'd like to dock in her port."" This is an important part of meteor society, as it is funny.

Meteors travel in herds for most of their lives. You may have seen meteors migrating. The scientific term for a herd of meteors is a <b><i>meteor shower</i></b>. 

The male meteor can be recognized by his bright plumes. While in heat, the male will blink his plumage to let the female know that he is prepared for docking. The male meteor can also be identified by the low humming noise he makes while in flight.

The female meteor is larger than the male. She also blinks her plumage while in heat, but her plumage is only white, not red like the male. The noise a female meteor makes is slightly higher in pitch than the males. 

Once the meteors have finished docking, the female may be pregnant. The conception, pregnancy and birth of a baby meteor lasts for six seconds, on average. An infant meteor is called a <b><i>tragedy</i></b>.

So look up to the skies at night! Meteors could be docking just above you, and you'd never know!"

Kyle: The Bible does so have a sequel, the Book of Mormon. 
Me: The Book of Mormon is not a sequel, it's fan fiction. 


Kyle: I'm gonna go take a piss. 
Timmo: I'll watch. 
Kyle: NO!

(That's totally out of context, but that was said in that exact order, one after the other, and it was hilarious.) 


I'd also like it to be recognized that Jeff's dog loves me more than it loves him."

Truer words were ne'er spoken. 

Also, memorize this if you play basketball with us. 

Points go 

1 
2 
3 (should you break and get a basket, we officially call that getting Pi) 
4 
5 
All of them 
All of them plus 1
All of them plus 2 (however, if you got Pi by breaking, you are allowed to call this Octo-Pi)
All of them plus 3
All of them plus 4
Prime (but, if you get to Prime before anyone tips someone and before anyone else gets Prime, then you have Optimus Prime. Should you get Optimus Prime with Pi, you have Optimus Pi)
Prime plus 1 
Prime plus 2
Prime plus 3 
Prime plus 4 
All of them teen 
Yahtzee 
All of them teen plus 2
All of them teen plus 3 
Twenty 
Ding (unless you got Pi, in which case you get Pot Pi here, and you points are set back to 17, because technically Pi is a little bit over 3, and therefore you'd have a little bit over 21)




And Ding ends it, as scoring Ding is the goal of Tips."

But now I wonder, what do people who hate the environment call themselves?"

"event","I was just watching a show on the History Channel called ""The Antichrist"" where they talk about prophecies from the Bible and so on. Well, as they cut to commercial, they did a short insert thing that was simply ""The Antichrist is brought to you by Lexus."" 

Bam, then off to a Lexus ad. Just thought you guys should know. 



And some of you seem to have forgotten dolphin sex. 

So, dolphin sex. Remember that."

"event","I just saw the greatest commercial ever. It started off like a commercial for a restaurant, all with the guy cooking and plates being served up nicely. Then, just as you thought you knew everything, they switch it up on you and it turns out you know only very little, if anything at all. Why is this cook so good at his job? He's got some sweet-ass gloves that apparently turn him into a kitchen magician. 

The guy was wearing these gloves and not even caring that he was reaching into open flames to pick stuff up. He was all, ""Oh, fire? No, sorry, I don't even care because I'm a Kitchen Magician and I don't feel pain like normal people. Except for when my fish died. That fish was the best."" And he kind of gets sad here and you leave him alone, because what right do you have to be bringing up his fish like that? Not cool. 

All that aside, we should all get those gloves and touch things that are hot, and when people ask why we're doing it we can splash acid on their faces."

"event","The other day, I watched Jeff play Pokemon Snap on the Nintendo 64 for four solid hours. 

Yeah. 

For those of you who don't know, Pokemon Snap is a game where you take pictures of Pokemon. Yes, the intense environment lends itself to pants-wetting situations such as ""Is Pikachu dancing? Get a picture, or Professor Oak will be displeased!"" and ""Was that a landmark? Fuck fuck fuck, get it get it, oh shit you suck, you fucking missed it."" 

Ah well."

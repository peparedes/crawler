"event","i thought about this long time...drunk again now...well...it's like that i gotta tell you.

but I don't know if i want to date this suka anymore. she mistreating me all the vremia...vremia lj..

ia pishu chush' tolko tuta..no Sonechka!! gde ty? Why Sonechka? That was name of the first girl I slept with! She was hot! She really was...I loved her. But then her parents told me to get lost, because I wasn't good enough.

So now i am thinking - why do parents make my life such hell! I am tired of being a good boy! I am! I really want to be independent. Why don't they want me to have my own life?

Pochemu mama mne vse vremia zvonit i na menia oret? Ia ne vinovat!! I am innocent. I don't want to be her son anymore! I am not her son!

I don't want to be a doctor, just because my mom wants me to be one! I didn't become a lawyer to make a lot of money! I just finished college and I don't care!

Mne POFIG! VSE blia, suki!!!

Well, my girlfriend loves me....What should I do???

Jesse, do you love me?"

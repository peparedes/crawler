"event","So I'm learning the things I missed quickly. I thought most of it would be boring, but know, I missed the important stuff. 

::sweatdrop:: Aqua don't have people shut me with arrows. It is cereal, I will buy you more. Shooting me is not the answer. (She plotted with Speedy to have me hit with stunner arrows.)

I need to not hang out with her. Anyone up for anything?"

"event","So, I'm back at East. I was having some issuse with a certain double moving in and eating fish tacos every day, but she is gone and I'm better. It's a good thing I came back when I did, it looks like East has gone to hell. I have one thing to say. Speedy, you don't leave the team. For anything... So Aqua was shocked to see me come back. I changed my screen name because aqua pointed out that all the other doubles have semi- matching screen names and whatever. She is really cool. She also told me some of the stories I've missed while I was in Atlantis. She seems to be in a stooper, so I'm thinking of taking her and both sets of twins out for icecream. Oh yeah, I'm that brave. lol."

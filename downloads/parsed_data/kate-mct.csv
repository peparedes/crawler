"event","Due to a troll on <lj title=""spn_hardcore "" user=""spn_hardcore"" />threatening to report anyone who posts on that comm and trying to friend members in order to track them and possibly report them, I&#39;ve decided to lock my posts, at least the fic ones. This isn&#39;t something I decided to do on the spur of the moment, but I refuse to have some asshole try to get me in trouble because of their own narrow-mindedness. So please comment here to be friended. I&#39;ll check your journal and friend you.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the criteria for being friended.<br /><br />1. Your journal cannot be brand new and it needs to have some entries in it. Doesn&#39;t have to be fic, it can be entries about you, what&#39;s going on in your life, what&#39;s going on in school, whatever, you just have to have some entries to tell me what sort of person you are.<br /><br />2. You need to have some friends. They don&#39;t necessarily have to be people I recognize (though that helps), but journals with no friends except for the default ones that come with joining LJ will not get you friended.<br /><br />3. You need to be a member of a comm I&#39;m in.<br /><br />4. You must be over 18.<br /><br />The reason for the criteria is that trolls often set up brand new accounts with no entries for the sole purpose of joining comms and starting trouble and I want to avoid that. The over 18 is because some of these stories, especially my non-SPN ones can be quite graphic and/or kinky and I don&#39;t want underage eyes seeing them. I will check journals before friending.<br /><br />If anyone has a Friends Only Banner up for use, let me know."

"event","I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve talked about what I do for a living. I&#39;m a phone canvasser for a non-profit veterans&#39; group. I call people and ask if they have clothes, shoes, or household goods they want to get rid of. It can be extremely tedious and frustrating, especially when calling areas where people aren&#39;t inclined to donate.

Lately, things have been very frustrating and there have been times I&#39;ve thought of quitting and finding another job. I like this job, I work from home, set my own hours, have little to no supervision(I have a coordinator I talk to, but only a few times a week), but it&#39;s commision based and some weeks it seems the more work I do, the less I get.

This week though, I&#39;ve been trying to not get stressed out. All I can do is my best, and it&#39;s been working, at least so far. Two areas I HATE calling haven&#39;t been too bad. Guess Time will tell.

In other news, I got my hair cut very short. I love having long hair, but my hair is soo thick that having long hair gives me headaches. I might post a pic later."

"event","So, I've decided to try and get my life together(HA!) and part of it is actually wearing a bra, I hate bras and have avoided wearing them for most of my life, but with my decision to try and bring my life into some semblance of order, bra wearing became a priority.

Did I mention that I hate bras? I did? Well, I also hate bra shopping(I hate shopping for clothes in general). I thought I was being clever by going for JMS' Comfort Fit Bra, which you can step into or pull over your head. Wrong! I'm between sizes, 4X is too large and 3X is almost too small. I err'd on the side of support and got a 3X, which keeps wanting to roll up in the front. Then I bought some tank tops for summer and even though the top and the bra are the same size, the bra straps STILL show!

On the bright side, I'm losing weight, not eating so much, and exercising. That's something, right?"

We have a Christmas Club account and actually have money in it this year, and B. I'm not expected to buy everyone's gifts this year or any year.

"event","I know a lot of my flist has four legged friends in their lives, so here's a tip on how to get pet hair out of furniture quickly: Take a dishwashing glove, put it on, get it wet, then wipe it across the furniture. The hair will come up in gobs. Then all you have to do is get the hose attachment for your vaccumm cleaner and vaccumm it up. Takes only a few minutes and your furniture is pretty close to hair free. One bit of advice though: only do this when you have to and hold off until the last minute, that way you don't upset your furry friend."

"event","My family and I aren't into DIY, we'd rather be lazy and pay someone to do it(and do it right, hopefully). But my dad was convinced that we could stain our barely used deck ourselves and it would take no time at all and we'd have a week of vacation to do whatever we wanted. WRONG!
<lj-cut>
First off, our deck is dried out. The drought of 2012 absolutely cooked it and it's never really recovered. Second of all, it needed to be cleaned. Thirdly, my mother and I both knew it was going to take at least two coats of whatever to cover the deck properly, but Dad insisted that we could do it ourselves.

Two weeks ago, I went to powerwash the deck to get it ready and the powerwasher wouldn't work. We changed the oil, it worked for about five minutes and quit. Since my dad didn't have the time(or the real know-how) to fix it right then, I had to come up with Plan B and ended up spending the better part of a week including an entire weekend cleaning that damn deck from top to bottom with vinegar and water.

Then Dad started having trouble with his legs, which has limited his ability to help us. Mom and Dad spent July 4 with my dad's brothers when we really needed to work on the deck because we're supposed to have rain all this week except for last Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday(Monday). Friday we didn't have the supplies, Saturday, Mom and Dad were at Uncle Dave's, which left us with Sunday and Monday to paint this fucking deck. We painted the rails Sunday(mindnumbing is the nicest way to describe it). The stuff Mom bought was Behr Deck Over and it has the consistence of cake batter. We painted and said we'd come back in the morning, do the second coat and the floor.

Of course it couldn't be THAT simple. The second coat went on...okay, but then we had to paint the area between the spindles because Mom decided to do this in contrasting colors. That had to be done by hand, but Dad was going to roll on the rest so Mom and I could have well earned rest(since we'd been doing most of the work). Except that even though the commercial and the bucket show this crap being applied with a roller, we couldn't get to stick to our rollers to be of any real use. And since Dad's leg was STILL bothering him, Mom and I spent the better part of THREE hours painting the floor of our deck BY HAND while Dad sat inside and nursed his leg. He did promise to pay us both for our efforts, fixed dinner, and was smart enough to not offer any critique of our work, which helps, but Mom and I were NOT in good moods when we were finished. We've already decided that we're not getting out of our PJs tomorrow, the rest of our plans for vacation will have to wait.</lj-cut>"

My nose was stopped up and I was having terrible headaches that made me feel like the top of my head was trying to blow off. Nothing seemed to help and it was becoming pretty unbearable. Finally, after my shower last night, I cleaned out my ears and it was like someone had released a pressure valve in my head. I still have a little bit of a headache, but it's been more manageable and more like the headaches I have when it rains since it's been raining almost every day for a week.

I'm glad too, because my vacation starts this week and I do NOT want to be sick on vacation!"

"event","This has been a crazy week. Last Thursday night, our A/C started putting out hot air. The guy who came to look at it said he thought the coil had a leak. None of this would be a big deal except: 1. We really didn't have the money to fix it and 2. We were expecting unseasonably hot weather that weekend and for the next couple of weeks. Sunday was hellish, 88 degrees, no A/C, think about moving and you break out in a sweat. Poor Mercury was so miserable. Monday, due to rain, the repairman couldn't come out. Tuesday, he finally came out and got the A/C working and he put a hustle on it because we're expecting temps in the 90s(!!). 

Then my dad comes home yesterday and says that he'd discovered why his back and knee was hurting, the seams on his shoes were splitting and he was having to hold them together with duct tape. Backstory: My dad went into work last week and discovered that one of his co-workers had left a machine running all night and the machine had flooded the shop with EDM oil, which is NASTY. Dad cleaned up the mess, but the oil had gotten into his shoes and destroyed the seams, so he needed new shoes. Bright side was that he had some extra money, so we got to eat out at our favorite restaurant.

Today, Pro-Wrestling Legend, Dusty Rhodes died unexpectedly at the age of 69. He was known as 'The American Dream' or simply 'Dream'. He was the son of a plumber, a proud Texan, and a great professional wrestler. He didn't look like much, but he could cut a promo like no one else and was a great innovator. He also dedicated his in-ring retirement to training the next generation of wrestlers in WWE's farm territory, NXT.

Also Christopher Lee, best known for his roles in the Hammer horror films and as Count Dooku in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy passed away.

Good things of things: I'm going to be going on vacation the week after July 4. It's really a staycation since my parents and I have a lot of stuff to do around the house, but Mom and I are planning to go to the zoo and maybe to a Holocaust museum in Terre Haute."

The scary thing was realizing that my tongue had been slowly swelling, as were my lips. Now that I'm back to good ol' regular Crest, I'm feeling a lot better(though losing the full, red lips was kind of a bummer)."

We were able to buy a new stove(not that we had much of a choice) and we're trying to find ways to tighten our belts(though they're already pretty tight). But now, my dad's sister had a heart attack yesterday and they've found that all four of her arteries to her heart are 100% clogged and it might be worse.

I have health insurance for the first time since I was 19 due to my worthless Republican governor finally expanding our state's Medicaid program. I've also been having an allergic reaction to Crest Pro Health toothpaste, it feels like I have a fever blister all around the inside of my lips and the only thing I've done different is change toothpaste.

"event","This past weekend was a worrying one for me, my cat, Mercury, suddenly stopped eating his food. Merc's always had a healthy appetite, so for him to not eat or want to eat was concerning. We tried several things and Merc just didn't seem to be interested, plus he just wanted to sleep and was very lethargic. Things came to a head Monday when I gave him some canned tuna(yeah, I know it's not good for him, but at that point I was desperate to get him to eat SOMETHING) and he ate like he hadn't eaten in days(which he probably hadn't). At one point, Mom and I discussed whether or not he might have a blockage when he hid in 'his room'(under our sofa) and didn't come out when my dad came home(VERY unusual). At one point, I was considering rearranging the kitchen just to put Merc's dish back in its original spot. Finally, yesterday, I realized that when it was dinnertime, Merc would sit by the unopened box of cat food that was where we usually kept his food(the old box was moved to the kitchen for convenience) and cry. So I opened that box and gave him some food and he gulped it down. Since then, he's started acting like himself again, he even ate some stale treats I'd used to try and get him to eat. So, everything's okay again, but it was very scary for me."

Then I thought that I'd like to write a version that was genderbent(yeah, done to death, but I don't care). So I spent last night casting my genderbent masterpiece. I originally had everyone genderbent, but decided to keep it to Sam and Dean, even though I had Elizabeth Hurley cast as Crowley(Bedazzled is one of my favorite movies), Mariska Hargitay as John, and either Kathy Bates or Samantha Ferris(Ellen) cast as Bobby. However, my casting changed from Hayden whatshername from 'Heroes' and 'Nashville' as Dean and Evangeline Lily as Sam to Hilarie Burton as Dean and Sophia Bush as Sam just because I loved them on One Tree Hill."

"event","So, doing some checking on prices for Season 10 episodes, I found out that Amazon is now offering Season Passes in much the same way Apple(boo, hiss) is. You can either buy as you go, or make a one time payment.

That isn't how Amazon's been doing it. Their Season passes were buy as you go, but at a reduced price. If it's still like that come October, I might do the one time payment, as it'll save me a bundle over the year since digital media is taxed(?!?!)."

During the next five days, post three positive things about your day and ask three people to do the same so the positive attitude can gain some ground. <lj user=""cuddyclothes"" /> tagged me.

1. The godawful heat and humidity is gone! We were able to open the doors and windows again, which makes Mercury happy.

2. A friend of my mother's is coming to look at Sybil(our stove) and see why she's suddenly not wanting to work.

3. I got a hair cut yesterday, so no more half out grown mullets for me!

My mind is drawing a blank on tagging, so if you're reading this, I tag you!"

I'm PISSED! The Build Team was my favorite part of the show. Adam and Jamie are great, don't get me wrong, but I LOVED the build team! They were always fun and interesting to watch. Gonna have to think long and hard if I want to continue watching Mythbusters now that they're gone. 

My guess is that Tory and Grant are going to be working on the upcoming Star Wars films and they don't want to make a whole new team, but I'm still mad."

"event","Wow. I haven't updated my journal in forever! Between modding and work, I haven't had time or inclination. So, for those who are new here:

My name is Tiffany, but I go by Paige or Kate
I'm 30ish...Fuck it! I'm staying 29 forever!
I live with my parents(yeah, it's pathetic) and my spoiled rotten cat, Mercury.
I love Supernatural! I'm a Sam/Jared!girl, but I do like Dean...most of the time. Jensen is gorgeous, no doubt about it, but Jared has a special place in my heart.
I'm trying to get back to writing, you'll find my stuff here in a master post. I'm going to try and re-write my 'Pregnancy in the Newsmagazines' series because, looking back at it, it was really bad.
I love DIY and Home Improvement shows, I've learned a lot from them. I also love documentaries, historical programming and funny shows about stupid people.
I love to read and am always in the middle of at least two books. So far, the best books I've ever read and finished is 'I, Claudius' and 'The Godfather'."

"event","My parents have been fighting ALL WEEKEND and now it's carrying over into this week!

Mom's X-over car had turned into a real gas guzzler, so Dad told her to go find a new one. She test drove a Honda(which is what Dad wanted her to get) but said that there was a flaw in the suspension. She went to a Hyundai dealership, found a car she liked and decided to buy it. Dad got mad because he told her to not sign anything, but then he told her to do what she wanted, so she bought the car. Dad kinda came around when he saw how nice the car was, but then he found out that Mom got it from a dealership that sold him a lemon in the 80s. He finally agreed to sign the papers for the car(his name was on the loan for the x-over). Then today, I'm not sure what started it, but they were really going at it.

Now, they seemed to have calmed down, but man it was tense in this house all weekend."

If you had bothered to read my mother&#39;s chart, you would&#39;ve known that my mother had her eyes dialated six months ago and therefore, did not need to have them dialated again. You also would&#39;ve known that my mother&#39;s eyesight is VERY poor and that it would&#39;ve been very dangerous to dialate her eyes and then expect her to drive herself home. My mother was not expecting to have her eyes dialated and was expecting to go to work today. Your failure to do your job not only put my mother and other drivers&#39; lives at risk, thankfully she was able to get home okay, but also cost her a personal day."

"event","This year I turned 30. Yeah, it&#39;s not as big a deal now to be 30 and single as it used to be, but it was still pretty depressing. Thanksgiving with my family was depressing because one of my uncles is in jail and it&#39;s cause a bit of a rift in the family, plus I was sick with a migraine after busting my ass to get the house and the food ready for Thanksgiving. My mom commented that the only thing she had to cook Thanksgiving was the potatoes. I prepped and cooked the turkey, cooked the chicken and noodles and baked a pie. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next year with our family. Hopefully, things will be better, I&#39;m taking it one day at a time.

I&#39;ve been a Christian my whole life, but over the last several years, I&#39;ve stopped going to church. I first thought it was because I&#39;d suddenly become an athiest or an agnostic, but now I think it&#39;s because I&#39;ve fallen out with the church I&#39;ve been attending my whole life. I&#39;m a Libera, I believe in science, Evolution, climate change and in diversity, the church I go to is very conservative and I became increasingly angry and frustrated with the church&#39;s insistance on trying to make American History and science fit into their view of the world, so I&#39;m going to find another church that I feel comfortable with and I&#39;m going to get back to my faith and hopefully open my life up to meeting new people.

I&#39;ve decided to start making things for Project Linus. I don&#39;t have children(though I&#39;m hopeful) and other than a few ladies my mom works with, no friends who are have children(I&#39;m hopeful that will change too), but I love making things that make people happy and giving a blanket to a child who needs it will help."

I've had this journal for a few years but never felt the urge to post an 'About Me' post, but since I've got a lot of friends and people reading my stuff, I'd better let you get to know me.<br /><br />My name is Paige, I am&nbsp;27 years old. I live in Indianapolis, Indiana with my parents and my&nbsp;spoiled cat Mercury. I've been writing since I was ten but have only been writing fanfic for about three and&nbsp;a half years. I enjoy writing, reading, playing piano, knitting and crocheting. I'm a big history buff. My favorite subjects are British History, American History and Religious History and I'm also getting interested in Military History.<br /><br />I'm a fairly nice person but I do tend to fly off the handle about things when something pisses me off. Things I tend to rant about: politics, religion, stupidity (big rant trigger) and people in general (another big rant trigger). <br /><br />I'm a strict carnivore and I'm fairly overweight but I'm looking into getting a bike to try and lose some weight.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now, about my stories. I am currently mainly writing about Supernatural and Real Person Fic. I have written a series involving male-pregnancy, if that thing squicks you, do us both a favor and don't read it. If any of my stories trigger a squick, don't read them. I suffer&nbsp;fools badly and reading a story that you know has things you don't like and then bitching at me because you didn't like it will not be tolerated. <br /><br />That being said, I do appreciate constructive criticism which means telling me if I have an error or need to improve on something. It does NOT mean calling me names or blasting my work because you didn't read the warnings, whatever they may be. I do put warnings in my story headers so please read them before reading the story.<br /><br />Again, I'm a fairly nice person and I try to follow the Golden Rule. Enjoy yourself and welcome to my journal.</lj-cut>"

Mom has a friend who is pregnant and I&#39;ve gotten a reputation in her office for making baby things for her pregnant co-workers. I&#39;ve picked out a super easy pattern and I found some videos by a woman called CraftyGemini that explained sewing to me in a way my worthless Home Ec teachers never did. I&#39;m currently working on a cardigan sweater for my mother and as soon as I get it finished, I&#39;m going to buy the fabric and get started! My plan is to piece the quilt top together on my sewing machine and finish it by hand(this baby is due in January, I don&#39;t have the time to try and do the whole thing by hand)

I&#39;m so excited!"

"event","I need to vent, so please excuse me.

My aunt has emphysema and advanced pulmonary fibrosis, which means that she has scar tissue in her lungs. Since pulmonary fibrosis is a secondary illness and since my aunt has smoked since she was a teenager, it is possible that the PF is a side effect of the emphysema. Either way, she needs to quit smoking. She wants to live to see her oldest granddaughter graduate from high school in the spring.

My mom&#39;s younger brother was diagnosed with throat cancer Thursday. It goes from the back of his tongue down into his throat on both sides and it&#39;s touching one of his tonsils. They could remove it now, but it would require removing so much tissue that he&#39;d never be able to eat through his mouth again. The ENT has recommended chemo and radiation but has told my uncle&#39;s ex(she took him to the doctor) that there is a chance that the chemo and radiation won&#39;t work. As it is, if he does chemo, they are going to insert a tube into his stomach so that he can ingest liquified food through a tube. He&#39;s getting a second opinion but it doesn&#39;t look good.

I seriously wish that it was May and my family was looking forward to Charleston because the latter half of this year has really sucked.

Thanks for reading(if anyone is)."

My grandmother could sew like no one&#39;s business. The woman could whip out things on her 60+ year old Singer like it was nothing. We inherited that sewing machine when she died and the thing refused to work(I swear she jinxed it). I&#39;d expressed some interest in sewing but never thought I could afford to get a machine to learn but Santa surprised me last year and for a year that damn machine has sat in its box because I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d have the patience to do it. Then I see Adam Savage from Mythbusters at a sewing machine during the &#39;Hindenburg Mystery&#39; episode and now I&#39;m like &#39;If HE can learn to sew, so can I&#39;."

"event","My parents and I are planning to go to Charleston in May to celebrate their 30th anniversary. We&#39;ve been looking forward to this for months but all of a sudden, a lot of drama has popped up that made me seriously reconsider going.

1. My mother told me one day that after Dad paid a guy he worked with to pull down our old shed and put up a new one, there was going to be about $300 and she was thinking about using it to buy vacation clothes. I teased her saying that she could probably buy enough summer clothes for herself for $300. She told me, she was thinking that we would use the money to buy ALL of us summer clothes. I had been planning to buy my summer clothes online but held off because Mom and Dad said they&#39;d do it. Well, last week I bring it up to my dad and he throws a fit saying that since I&#39;m working (though I had my job at the time of the first conversation) they expected me to buy my own clothes. That was NOT how it was put to me and I WAS working when Mom told me. Even if I wasn&#39;t working, I earn money from cleaning our church and could&#39;ve had my stuff in March if she hadn&#39;t said something. I was so hurt and pissed I didn&#39;t know what to do.

2. My 10 y/o car has been dying a slow death the past few years. I don&#39;t drive a lot, but 2010, the starter went, we got it fixed, then Spring 2011, the thermostat goes out and because Summer 2011 was so stinking hot, I was afraid to drive it anywhere and we could afford to get the thermostat fixed. So, finally the car&#39;s engine began going yesterday and I decided to donate it to Goodwill. Well, Mom and Dad threw a fit about that, even though they were bitching about me not driving it enough, and it turned into a huge fight with them yelling at me and throwing everything in my face, including the clothes thing. It was on the tip of my tongue to yell that THEY offered to buy the clothes and I had already started working then. If the clothes was because I didn&#39;t have a job, they should&#39;ve told me that and I would&#39;ve bought the clothes myself and spared us all the drama.

Things are better today, but last night, I almost told them to just leave me at home and go to Charleston by themselves because I didn&#39;t want to be stuck with them in a hotel room for a solid week if this was what I would have to put up with."

"event","After way too many years of unemployment and not finding anything I want to break my back doing, I have found a JOB! I&#39;ll be making calls for a veteran&#39;s organization in Indianapolis. I&#39;ll be working from home and I&#39;ll be able to set my own hours. The pay is commission based, but it&#39;s a job! *Dances*"

"event","I&#39;m sending this out to all my friends on LiveJournal: If you buy things online and most of us do, do yourself a favor and pay for your shipping. I was helping my mom sort out some strange charges on her debit card and realized that when my mom had ordered some things from a clothing catalog and was offered free shipping, which she was glad to use. Now we&#39;ve found out that by using that Free shipping code, Mom had signed up for also signed her up something she didn&#39;t know she was signing up for. Mom&#39;s had to cancel her current debit/credit card and she&#39;s talking about going back to writing checks when purchasing things from that particular merchant.

I personally have never had a problem with this happening, but I thought I should warn people so this doesn&#39;t happen to them.

Update: Well, my mom called the merchant in question and found out that it wasn&#39;t a shipping code, it was something worse. It seems that a message kept popping up for her to sign up for a program and wouldn&#39;t let her finish her order until she said yes, which is extortion if you ask me. Anyway, it&#39;s all straightened out but I don&#39;t think Mom will be dealing with that particular company anymore.

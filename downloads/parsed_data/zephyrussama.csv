"event","It's a new year and I shall do my best to be better about posting in the doll journal. So I decided to start off right and do a post with my current status in Doll-ness.

<b>So! on the doll acquisition front:</b>
Due to pushing back my trip to Japan, I ended up with some extra funds right in the middle of December... Since all my X-mas shopping was taken care of... what was I to do but splurge on dolls?

I have a Heath on layaway~ I've got about $400 more to go and he's mine! I already know I want to repaint him. Actually, it was a repainted Heath that made me love him. I initially didn't like him! Of course I realised how much I wanted him well after he had been sold out and even hard to find on the second hand market. I cannot wait to see what character he will become for me!

I have a Latidoll L head coming (X-mas version). Rillystar on DoA was spliting one.... I had missed him the initial time... but then I looked at her thread one day and the buyer for the head had backed out! So I jumped on him. He arrived to her a couple days ago.... which a huge chip out of the back of his head! AUGH! So now we're in process of returning the head and seeing if they can ship it directly to me. =____= I just want my emo puppy~

There is an Unoss body I have on hold too. I'm so addicted to Unoss it's not even funny! =^^;;= And I just bought new hands for the Oldskin SD10 boy body I have sitting in pieces.... the pudgey little hands were annoying me to the point where I didn't even want to LOOK at the body. so I bought the H-06 hands which are considerably less chubby and stubby. I don't really go for the kid look in my SD-sized dolls. I wonder if I will really end up using this body...? the oldskins are well... Not as nice as any of the newer ones.

Lastly, I have an AR X-mas kit Dan on the way, though I'm only keeping the body.... So after finding out that the Soah head WILL fit on AR fair boy body, I debated getting one. And then my friend popped up pointing out what a great deal the X-mas dan kit was and how much she wanted the head so we decided to split him! The next day I ordered him >_>; Of course AR has delayed my shipping =___= he was supposed to ship out Dec 17th.... and now I'm told he won't ship until MID January... augh! I'm getting antsy!!

<b>On the Project Front:</b>
The two Gravity Doll heads are doing quite well! (<a href=""http://www.denofangels.com/forums/showthread.php?t=102627"">Please go here to see them</a>) The marketplace on DoA has warmly received them. I need to go pick up the mold-making goods so we can get to casting very soon~ (I just need a weekday off to go pick them up)

I am planning on sculpting a special body type. No, I won't say what it will be yet, or why it's special~ I'm just being a tease. There is also another head I want to sculpt once I have time to work on it. Again... being a tease X3

I have a couple clothing commissions I need to finish ASAP! They are a week or so behind schedule due to unforseen family events. And even though both customers are being very understanding of my slowness but I need to finish them! Okay time to thread the sewing machine (after I get off work anyway!)

Let see... I also have a full waiting list for clothing commissions. =@__@= I'm leaving myself very busy indeed!

I have several heads to paint:
For others:
WS El Elf ('04, not '06) for a friend
NS El Elf Vampire for a friend

Then my own dolls to paint/sand/mod:
Unoss Aika - sand seams, and paint
Soah Boy - faceup
Nanuri NS - mod and paint (waiting on eye beveler to arrive)
Nanuri WS - mod and paint (waiting on eye beveler to arrive)
Unoa Lusis + 2 faceplates - repaint
Heath - Faceup (once he arrives)

So much to do! Good thing I will soon have a lot more freetime!"

I'm patiently waiting for the El to tell me what his name is. Baron said he might keep the name Aramina for the Elf Lishe... but he's still not certain yet.

and while I can't find the card reader, here's a really crappy pic that doesn't do the El Elf any justice taken from my camera phone:

Apparently talking about my BJD to a co-worker of mine has inspired her to start going after the doll she's been wanting her whole life... literally! She's wanted this doll since she was five. So no... it's not a BJD she's going after, but a large German Sasha doll from her childhood. She'd always put it off as being an unneccesary purchase since she is an adult, and it's a doll. But she's had the small Sasha since she was a little girl and still keeps it by her bed. Apparently my BJD have convinced her that dolls are *not* just for children. 

That just makes me happy, because she came over to my desk telling me how she's going to closely follow an auction to try and win this doll!"

"event","So, reading through this thread:
http://denofangels.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46693

And well, I remember the same thing happening when the Shooter outfits came out a few months back.

I can understand why DoA would want to censor such topics on their forum since there are so many different types of doll-owners out there. But. Personally, I don't see it as offensive. I don't understand WHY it's so horrible to have historical references (Or even just something close) to the point where someone will swear off every buying from a company because of it. It's not that I don't understand the horrors that went on for that time period with officers wearing those uniforms, BUT, just like people who are not Christian don't cringe at the sight of a cross (Come on now, Crusades??). Not to mention as a Korean and I should hate every Chinese or Japanese person for the hundreds of years of rape, war, pillaging, etc. But I don't. Maybe the problem is that it's not ""Old"" enough. But then I think about that too, and we Buy Japanese-made dolls.. Japanese... the ""Yellow-Nazis."" 

Though, I'm not for hanging tons of swastikas everywhere or pronoucing Nazism is okay. Far from, actually. I don't think any group that openly wants another group to be harmed/enslaved/erradicated is ""Okay."" But as it is a historical uniform, and even more historical symbol (Buddhism), I like knowing about it and seeing it's availability as a Historical Clothing piece. Nothing more. 

I love historical costumes, so it makes me sad to see that some people aren't able to just turn away and resign themselves to not buying it if they don't like it. But instead have to vehemothly protest it and make it into an uncomfortable item for those who had nothing against it in the first place. I would personally rather have awareness over censorship. Though, I am not saying having negative feelings towards said item is ""wrong."" It's an opinion. But it gets to the point where it gets banned for other people. 

Just my thoughts on the matter, and I welcome any sort of Mature discussion on it, since I expect people I know to either have a similar opinion or an opposite one. My thoughts here are just an opinion. Valid, even if not agreed with."

I hate insomnia. I really do.
But here I am... At work. And completely exhausted. It's been a week now. Not that this is abnormal... seems like ever 1-2 months I get a period where I can't sleep for about a week. I try to lay down around midnight... but then I can't fall asleep until about 3am. Then my sleep is restless at best. I think I would have gotten past it over the weekend, except we had a guest stay over... which makes it so I can't sleep. I feel like such a zombie today...

but...

>wiggles toes<
Luts sent me an email saying they'd received my payment~ so now just gotta wait for the ship notification. >anxious!< besides that... My friend went to ALA over the weekend and picked up some vermillion HG eyes for Noelle~ <3 that boy is getting so spoiled and he doesn't even have a body yet. Though... thinking about a cosplay for my dolls made me realize... Zephy is my only large boy who's not BW. =x So that strikes out a few cosplays for the time being.

And... I'm WAY not prepped for KatsuCon! Seriously... SO much to get done. I wish Insomnia worked to my advantage to getting things done... but it makes it 100% hard to concentrate. in the day when I'm at work I want to just sleep... at home my mind is alert... Reminds me of when I took the caffiene pills the one time and I was so jittery I couldn't sit down and do anything.

and I ramble. So probably best just to stop this now."

"event","Wow I'm tired today.
Working on new project at work + Insomnia + excitement of ordering Elf Yder yesterday = One tired Spork. Not to mention I've still got a couple sewing commissions I'm WAY behind on. those are getting done this weekend after handing off all the neccessaries to friends traveling down to Anime LA. >So tired< If I ever agree to MAKE bias tape again, shoot me.

So work.. I spent 11 hours at work yesterday (got in early, left late)... Though, I did manage to scrounge about 10 minutes of time at work to order Yder... I guess I could go into story about that.

So. 6:30pm is when they went on sale. Of COURSE I have a conference call meeting at 5:30pm... which meanes it may or may not end at 6-6:15 like it should. Luckily it did, so I ran back up two flights of stairs to my desk, plopped down at the comp and hurriedly got all the items into my cart I was gonna buy (friends + BF asked me to throw in some extras for them). Then it's another 10 minutes until Yder goes on sale... So.. what do I do? Poke around DoA.. the luts site, etc, trying to soothe my nerves a bit before the moment of craziness hits. Then at 6:29pm my co-worker in the cube across from me shouts ""hey ----- is headed to your desk to ask about -----"" And I'm like ""Oh shit!"" because well, I'm at work and putting shopping in front of work would be a BIG no-no. So I'm cursing under my breath hoping he gets delayed. The order opens. I throw a BW elf Yder no make up into the cart like a bandit and type my shipping info in a frenzy... And send... Litterally he came to my desk as I was getting my Luts order confirmation email...  And this morning I still keep checking the confirmation email to make sure I didn't screw up! I'm uber glad I threw everything into the cart BEFORE and waited for the sale to open... 1min 30secs was the time I heard for him to sell out. That was SO much faster than the Breakaway (which I think was something like 20+ minutes)...

So now... A boy who's personality and role I haven't even planned will be coming >squee< All I know is he's going to be my Juri Boy's BF... Well, I hope. it really depends if they get along when he arrives. I thought Zephy and Ivy would get along, but they act like mortal enemies... Zephy kind of Ignores Cherry, but Ivy and Lucifer love her. and Lucifer and zephy seem to be co-conspiritors, though Lucifer and Ivy kind of ignore each other. Noelle really doesn't have a body of his own yet... (I need to remedy this for a number of heads..) So he may just steal Lucifer's body for a photoshoot when Unnamed Elf Yder arrives. <3

Also waiting for Leeke wigs to arrive~ I bought two for Noelle~ And his eyeballs. >laugh< though I'm thinking he won't be green-eyed, but I'm a sucker for green eyes."

I'm about $100 short. Not that it's really *that* big a problem. BF said I could borrow the last little bit to get him. 

But... Normal skin or BW? =@___@= I'm tempted to go BW so he'll be a cute match to my BW Juri-boy (I decided my Juri was going to be a boy. >giggle< )

Besides the Elf Yder, and the very obvious want for a MNF El (which I can wait a bit on since he prolly won't be limited) there's the FCS F-13 fairy boy... I'm probably picking the wing ear option... unless I squeal when seeing another set of ears on him. =^^= Which reminds me... I need to go pick out makeup for him so I can bring something down with me for reference when I place my order.

Whee.

<b>[EDIT]</b>
The verdict is now that the Elf Yder will be BW if possible so he and my BW juri can be hot BW elf lovers. >snk< Thanks <lj user=Tonihime> for that one."

It's not a bad head, it's just not to my tastes... So, what don't I like? the nose is a bit pointer than I thought... the cheeks are lower and puffier than expected, the lips are more pursed than I thought they'd be... And I must be spoiled by Luts ears... 'cause these ones look really flat and unrealistic to me. (I really LOVE the way luts does ears) And over all the face just looks.... Longer than I expected. Overall, he's nice looking, just not quite what I wanted. 

Well, I'm going to paint him up and see if I can love him after he's painted.... but I can definitely say it was not the 'love at first sight' experience that my other two boys gave me. So, I expect that he'll probably get sold off. I guess next up is saving for the Dolkot Kiss. Since he was the one I was going to use for this vision if Camine didn't turn out to be all I wanted.

=._.= I guess at the very least I can be happy over the fact I *didn't* spring to buy him with the body and all."

I'm tempted to bring one of my dolls to show my family.

Finally the much debated over name for the Breakaway was accepted. So he is now Lucifer (Understand I have no religious inclinations. My boyfriend, however, does. Hence why there was much debate over it.) For those who don't wish to address him by his name, his nicknames are Luce or Cifer (Though my BF has already taken to calling him Lucy or Lulu).

Also, <lj user=""aiebon"">'s holiday photos have made me want to take some of my own. I've got so many additions to the resin family this year it's gonna be a fun little photoshoot. I still need to figure out what to get them each for Christmas! Well, I guess Cherry got goggles... Lucifer is well, here. Ivy got shoes not too long ago... Man. I'm terrible at just giving them everything as soon as it comes! =o Spoiled brats. Well, actually both the boys are getting the Xmas shoes. So.. That counts. Heehee. I'm odd though. I really have no Christmas spirit.. like, none. Yesterday we went to the mall and I got all angsty even. I've never liked the holiday season... but the thought of making a Happy Christmas for my dolls makes me smile.

Back onto one topic... I was thinking of doing a 12 days of Christmas photoshoot, since the 12 days occurs *after* Christmas and I'll actually be gone for the Holidays anyway. =^^;;= Then again, there's the BJD tarot desk that Re-surfaced... I had wanted to do it originally... But ended up not having time. Well, we'll see. 

It's strange... I finally want to take photos of them again. For a while, I was just not wanting to take any photographs of my Resin dearlings, even though I was still playing with them. I have so many little couches and shelves they sit on that they are rarely in the boxes or carry bags. (crud! just remembered I have to make pillows for Cherry's carry bag since AlchemicLab doesn't give pillows in their boxes!)

Oh~ and I have ideas for at least 4 different outfits right now... and a couple comissions... so as long as I get off my lazy butt and sew things, expect pictures! If these turn out nicely, I'm thinking I'll finally accept clothing comissions for dolls. (I've been doing so many faceups lately I'm starting to wonder if I should open and esthetics shop!)

Anyway. Just some random thoughts."

I corrupted yet another: http://www.livejournal.com/users/tonihime/280430.html
I should start keeping a list of how many people I've gotten into BJDs (to the point where they purchased!). I believe at least 4 already. XD

On a very random note... I'm finally in the mood to take lots of pictures of my darlings again. I was in a slump of not wanting to make anything for them and not wanting to take pictures of them, even though I still had them out on display and played with them quite often.

I am very excited about the tea party on Saturday~ <3 I can't wait to take pictures of all the beauties that will be there. <3 But bloody hell!! How am I gonna get things made for my Dearlings? Ivy's got an outfit she can wear... I need to finish Cherry's shirt. But the two boys have nothing to wear! Well, I could probably put one of them in the cute Dollmore school uniform I have. But... what about the other. My poor breakaway doesn't even have a wig of his own yet. It won't arrive until my BF's order gets shipped (we hear sometime next week!) =._.= sadness! (not to mention the poor thing doesn't have a faceup or a name yet... the first name was shot down.) well, maybe I'll get to work on him tonight, his heads got sanded and coated yesterday, so they are ready for painting today (does anyone else find working a full time job is a drag on trying to get doll stuff done?)

On a happy note: The goggles I ordered in the group order came today... sadly, both were red when I orderd blue lenses for the larger set, *but* at least I like red, so I don't think I'll be sending them back. I'll see if my boy even likes them, then decide if I'll order another pair in blue."

If anyone wants to get a hold of me, you can always just comment here or PM me at sporkninja on DoA. both things send me emails, so I will see them.

[edit]
forgot to mention...

Cons I'll be attending:
Sakura Con (I should have an art alley table)
Fanime (have a dealer's room booth and will be helping at a friend's art table)
AX (again, an art table)

DoA is down for me again, so pre-emptively posting it up here. Got it as an extra outfit with Ivy, but it's not her style. The top and pants were obviously made for an SD/SD13 girl, not a Unoss because the pants are just a little tight in the hips and the top is way loose. Buttons and zippers really work, which to me is a bit of a pain, but someone else might like that. The top has a separating zipper, but I am unable to get it to open. [edit]We got the zipper open and it works fine. I'm just not forceful enough apparently.
$25 + S&H for top, pants, belt. Hanger not included."

I've been so terrible on keeping up with ANYTHING online! Actually, work's been keeping me so busy that I just haven't had time to go online. Other than that, Cosplay season's coming up, so almost all my free time is going to be spent sewing. My costumes, Baron's costume, my doll's costumes. So as the weeks progress expect a lot of pictures (hopefully)

But! I had to update that I went fabric shopping with a couple other DoA members and picked up all kinds of great stuff. Also, my Valentine swap item finally came! Obscurity and Bastion got Zephy these uber cute patent leather shoes and a cute beaded necklace! <3 AND my souldoll eyes came! Sharingans! and solid black! even got a pair of eyes my Unoss (who's been named Ivy) can wear! I also bout 2 more pair of glastic eyes from another DoA member, so ee! she's starting to get some new items. <3 Once I'm fully done with her face up she'll introduce herself. And, I plan to keep her as an ""Android""... I know most people don't keep that about her, but I'm going to. I have some pics of her.. I just need to remember to upload them when I am at home.

Saturday is the Bay Area Kimono BJD gathering, so hopefully we'll get some pics from that. =^_^= All of us in Kimonos! (which means I've got a LOT of kimonos to make in the next couple days)

I've also finally decided I WILL get my Isao head an SD13 girl body (L bust), and my dreaming El head will get a Volks Boy body. That way I have access to lots of different body types. <3

Just a quick pop-in to say I'm still alive. Work's been keeping me uber busy, so my poor unnamed Unoss hasn't had her face fully painted. =( I've also had no time to upload and touch up the pictures I took of Zephy in the snow. =/

Sorry that I have no kept up on everyone's journals! If you have exciting doll news (new arrives/face-ups/cute pics) comment here and point me out to the post. =D

I will throw a couple quick notes out there: My Unoss is fully sanded and restrung (I have to coat the poor dear... must get more MSC).. well, except her head, which is still detached for painting. (I have a few rather disturbing pictures of my Ball Jointed family including the return of the un-named Isao head!). So I've got some before and after shots of her body for sanding. <3 On that note, my BF says Unoss's resin is softer than Zephy's because it was much easier to sand. But continuing on the update news... Zephy now has a grey armchair, and I have this cute rocking bench that two can sit on. So cute! And I paid all of $18 for BOTH of them. XD I'm selling off Zephy's new coat because it's just a *tad* tight for him so I'm going to make him a new one. Will post on DoA when I get the pics uploaded.

Anyways. I think that's all. =^.^="

She and I left for Tahoe with Baron for a few days - which was just dreadful because she left me alone in the room <b>all</b> day by myself on Monday. I was quite upset... but then she handed me a new coat she made for me. So I guess it was okay. I also got to play in the snow, which was pleasant. Building a snowman is fun. 
But then on the way home, she frantically insisted we stop by her work. And when we did, she came back witha  very large package. But of course she wouldn't tell me what it was. So I had to wait until we got home to find out.
So, after arriving home, she finally (after several delays of her insisting she had to put things away) started opening the huge box. It was very strange, because when she opened the box, there was ... well. it looked like a mummy... Only wrapped in bubble wrap. I was rather perplexed. After much picture taking and bubble-wrap removal I finally discovered a person inside! I was both interested and disappointed. I was expecting that my poor companion head would finally have a body, but no, this one had breasts and... rather large hips... her hands and feet are far from small and dainty also.

...Needless to say, I was a little disappointed... Especially when I got sat on the shelf while Spork cooed over this monstrocity of a woman....</i>

Well. To shorten what Zephy said, Eee! My Unoss arrived! I don't have a name for her yet, and I'll have to upload pics tonight when I'm off of work (>looks at clock< Augh! 8.5 more hours to go!). I'm currently re-doing her face. <3 

Some things that were surprizing... her hands are larger than Zephy's. (I think someone joked about them being ""man-hands"") So are her feet, but just a little. She's got such gorgeous legs, hips, breasts.... but. her hips and legs are quite large! (she's got birthin' hips!!). Also, I remember how Zephyrus arrived and he had some seams, but oh MAN Unoss' seams are HUGE. =@___@= Lots and lots of sanding. Even her hands and feet need a good dose of sanding. While beautifully shaped, they have some serious sanding needed. The head mechanism is... interesting. I'm still getting the hang of using it. Her eyes are beautiful... but I think having to tape her head shut is a little strange for me... =^^;= I am in love with her little robot headgear. It's so cute!! But... It's a little hard to keep her wig sitting properly with the headgear on. So I'm not sure what to do there. I'm also not sure what to do about getting new wigs/eyes for her... the springs in the eye-mechanism are so small that I don't think most eye-types would work with them. =/ Kind of a bummer, but ah well! I like her default eyes enough so I don't think I'll worry about it too much. I mostly want to get her a new wig because I didn't see her being a blonde.
>sigh!< Being at work right now is excruciating!! I just wanna go home and play with my dolls! It's so much of the 'new-doll' tasks right now... sanding.. painting... Her persona is slowly shining out to me. >happy sigh!<"

"event","Couple quick announcements!:
- Sorry that I'm behind on everyone's journals. I spent the whole weekend trying to cough up a lung, and still had to do *lots* of running around. =_=
- Thank you to everyone who gave me such encouragement for the Unoss. <3 I really would have been muchly depressed, but everyone's kind words has filled me with hope!

Zephyrus is happily home now (well, as of Saturday) And that darn teacher gushed and gushed over him..... and didn't drop a stinkin' clue how to make a doll like him >_x So, looks like I'm off to try whatever methods *work*. Ha.

On a plus note: When to SF Chinatown w/ Baron yesterday. =^_^= Well, first to the Asian Art museum to drop off Kellyhime's DoD's (I made patterns for them! Woo), and we gotta look around the museum for free (fun!), And we've planned a Future Bay area Fabric run in a couple weekends from now (yaye). But oh yeah, back onto topic... So at SF, I ended up picking up a *cute* BJD-sized lace umbrella (I don't have a girl yet but ehh). Then funny enough, I bought this wine bottle cover that looks like a chinese outfit... and it fits Zephy XD (I'll post pics later) it's so funny. Lastly, I *finally* found a decent tea-set which fits Zephy. <3 So yesterday was good.\

And now a shamless plug: I'm selling hand-made kitty ears on DoA again. See the marketplace for details. XD All proceeds go to my Unoss fund! <3"

"event","Lost second Unoss auction in a row. Poooooo.
I should really stop because well... It's both stressful and depressing trying to bid on a doll (the depressing part is losing), but then I keep thinking about her and ugh. Which is funny, but I haven't really found myself drawn to many of the female dolls (like, maybe 2). I don't even care about the default clothes/eyes/wigs. I just love her face and body sculpt. I am even highly amused over the fact that my boyfriend wants me to win her as much as *I* want to. He thinks she's the prettiest doll he's ever seen (and he likes considerably more of the females than I do). He even bought me 7 yards of this gorgeous material to make a Kimono out of. One for me AND enough to make her a matching one.

So if anyone has any leads on a Unoss, please do contact me.

Plus note: Today is payday.
Negative note: Car payment and Rent are due.

"event","So, read through all  the entries on my friends page. 
Wow... everyone has so much going on...
It makes me enjoy the quiet moments of my lunch break.
And thank you everyone for the encouragement on the auction...
Sent off the deposit to Cresent Shop. So now I really just have to sit back and wait... I can't let myself get my hopes up like for the ebay auction. =;_;=
>deep breath<

On a side note, if anyone's read my DoA post on starting a new doll, I sadly have to part with Zephy tonight because my sister is taking him to school with her so that the teacher can look at him and tell us how to make a doll jointed like him. So This is the first time I'll be apart from Zephy for any amount of time. =;_;= it's only a day, but it makes me sad... Hopefully when he returns I can whisper good news in his ear of a Unoss coming home.

[edit]
>Squeal!<

They bid for me!
>swoons<
Must wait until the auction actually *ends* though!

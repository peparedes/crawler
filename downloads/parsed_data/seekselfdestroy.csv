"event","ahhhhhh, i own high speed internet connection. comcast has high speed internet at $14.99 for three months. so that is what i own. this is the first time i've typed something on a computer not relating to nextel and it's affiliates. because that is all i do now - answer calls from irate nextel customers taking their frustrations out on a little guamanian. i moved out...7 months ago. i live with my ever loving boyfriend james, and keenan - a hip-hop revolutionizer. we are never all home at the same time, so it's almost like i live alone.

my work hours: 4am - 12:30 pm
james' work hours: 9pm to 5:30am
keenan's work hours: 11:30am to 8pm

if you look close enough you will notice that when someone gets off work, another one starts work...we're like a relay race."

i haven't talked to wes for like, two days =( he went to florida to visit some friends. it's out in the sticks so i don't think he's getting any service on his cell phone. we're gonna need to spend some quality time together when he gets back, cause he'll only be in town for a week before he leaves for three months =(
he asked me to make him a business card. i was pretty proud of it cause i haven't done any design since i stopped working at the PDN.

"event","no picking up jesse
no applying at starbucks in seattle
no hanging out with wes in seattle
yes shopping at value village
yes working a 3 hour shift today

my plans fizzled out as my day started, oh well.

really wanted to go down to seattle today, but like half an hour before i was gonna catch the ferry, my manager calls me to come in at 7. that would of left me with exactly 1 hour of hanging out time in seattle, so poo. if only i didn't like money so much.

got a couple tee shirts at the value village and a friggin cool stripped polo and a cool brown button up shirt. looks boy scout-ish, but it isn't. so i guess that made up for not doing anything i planned to do.

give me loves people, loves...

"event","yeah, i'm tired. we had inventory tonight at work. was counting like crazzzzy. thought it would be a lot more fun. i didn't know that a crap load of old-ass-low-income people from some sort of agency were gonna come in with their scanning/counting machines. i'm gonna be dreaming of ""beep. beep. beep. beep, SKU CHECK!!!"" all night. oh, and i hate how it's so warm in the store. it's friggin washington, FUCKING MAKE IT COLDER!!!!!. i hate the hot. i feel like sticky, sweaty puke when it's hot. that's why i HAD to get away from the island. stina brought me macadamia nuts from hawaii and i got all giddy cause it reminded me sooo much of guam. then she started talking about how she's been going to her chamorro friend's parties. lumpia and babui, i miss the fiesta's sooo much. 

i need to take another photo for my driver's license. it sucks butt. i look like crizzap cause i had just woke up. my parents asked me to go with them to the store and we ended up going to the dmv after. i didn't think i was gonna pass anyway. so i didn't really care about what i looked like. you still wanna try using my driver's license jeanie???????"

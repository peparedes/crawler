Well... It has also been a long time since i have been able to say this as well... but i have a crush on a boy. well a man. A really good and cool and motivated man. He is truly awesome. Part of me hopes that this works out more than anything, and part of me is trerrified. see we are moving REALLY slow and just kinda hanging out. I'm trying it out, you know, the whole slow thing usually isnt my style. well.... i guess you never know if you dont go for it. so im going for it. why not. dive into life.
I'm terrified... but in a good way."

On our own

Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

everythings great with the family. i am excited to see them and actually spend some time with them this weekend. maybe cory and i can go out together. that's always fun.

(i just HATE it when people refer to us as still being together. I'm not your girl or your girlfriend, and you're not my boyfriend either. we know that...but everyone else needs to realize it and not let it slip!)

i am very glad that everything is going great in my life, but the one constant stressor that is always on my mind is money. i need a fucking job. so if anyone works in mt.p and/or knows somewhere that is highering please let me know!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm going to be forced to start donating plasma i know it!"

all i want is for you to be happy. that is all i every cared about. 




....i've been there, and when i was, i wished that i had someone there for me to hold me and tell me that everything was going to be ok. i am simply trying to be that person for you...as a friend, with no alterior motives.
so even though i cant give you a great big hug right now, i can tell u with certainty that everything will end up for the better. it might take a while or you might be over it tomorrow,who knows, but when it's all over and done with, you will be a better person because of it.

my car broke again. it wont start. sweet.
i have missed a couple of classes and now i have to talk to my professors and figure something out. oh well. i just feel like an idiot for starting off the semester by missing a few classes. it's ok though...it was well worth it.
my room is absolutly trashed. my books and clothes and everything else is everywhere all over my floor. i need to clean but i am so unmotivated.
i have to figure out my rent because i think it is overdue.
i have no money and i really need to find a job but it is so impossible!!!
i should do my resume since i have been talking about it for so fucking long. again...no motivation.
i want to talk to my parents without getting lectured or getting into a fight with them. 
it sucks a lot, but i know whats going to happen.
i'm going so say fuck it, get drunk and accomplish nothing tonight.
tomorrow i will talk to my professors, but i still have to email the ones from today...which i probably wont do either. i fucked up and missed an apointment with a professor today too.....stupid car.
so i will get nothing done except get my classes straightened out. no cleaning or organizing of my life. and then i will rip home and go to canada and party all weekend and not worry about my messy room or anything else that is crappy until early monday morning.
but that's my life i guess. it's worked for me so far.
what i really need to do is take tomorrow and get everything done that i need to do so i can party on thursday night and not have to worry about getting everything done on friday before i leave. i just need to relax.
someone tell me that everything is going to be ok.....
you we're always good at that. even if you werent sure if things were going to work out, when u said everything was going to be fine....i believed you.
i miss that.

but after all of this venting, i think i have found motivation in a sick twisted way. reading this over i sound pathetic. i need to take it one step at a time, and work everything out before the weekend. i will feel so much better then, and everything will fall into place.
except a job...but i can figure that out next week..."

I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now

It'll work itself out fine

Said, sugar, make it slow
And we come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

Mm, yeah

I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider

Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes
To make it, We won't fake it,
I'll never break it
'cause I can't take it

need some patience, yeah
gotta have some patience, yeah
all it takes is patience,
just a little patience

"event","last night was an absolute blast!!! i am so glad that i got to party with all of my friends together one last time before i go back to school. 
i'm heading back up sunday night. yeehaw.
classes start monday at 11 AM.



I'm sorry i was such an asshole to you last night, but i just wanted to hang out and have a good time with my friends. I didnt go to the bar to see you, i went because it was Jessica's birthday party and a bunch of people told me to go. i thought it was an open thing, and i had a blast, so no regrets! i'm sorry...i didnt know...
i do regret how i treated you when it was time for me to go, however.
i'm sorry i looked at you that way when you walked me to the car, and i'm sorry for the text messages. 
i know you are probably mad, but i would like to see you (just to say goodbye) before i go to school. i guess if u want to then give me a call, but if not it's cool too.

last night was just all over the place. We were drunk, but everything is OK now. no hard feelings, right?

ahhhhhh. ashley threw up twice on the way home, and i peed in her neighbors yard behind a tree. 
i love you steve-o!!!"

i missed that, and i am so glad that it is back.
this morning i realized how much i love the group.
i would love nothing more than to get everyone together and just get drunk and have a blast. That is the one thing i want before i go back to college.
well...maybe not the only thing i want before i go back...
hahaha

we do have fun though, 
and my biggest fear is for that to end.
i really just want to have a good time. We're young...you know?
nothing heavy or crazy intense.
but i do have feelings for you still. 

i guess what happens, happens.
and it is actually creepy how much i feel like just going with the flow right now. Dont get me wrong, i will fight for what i want or believe in...but there is a time and a place for everything.

i just love having fun...that's what i'm all about...and i have had the most fun of my life with you guys. i hope it stays that way."

"event","well, a lot of things have changed in the last week. a LOT. 
i dont know what's going to happen with us....i dont think you know either.....i'm not sure anyone really does anymore.
all i know is that if you listen to your heart, whatever truly makes you happy will be OK by me.
it's funny, because i spent the last month worrying about our relationship...and now that it is the way it is right now, i am worry free. i know i will never totally loose you, because we have been friends for like 15 years, and that is a strong bond that is nearly impossible to break. 
I feel like i did when we first started dating, and that is cool. we just let the situation get away from us is all. i took advantage of our relationship, and for that i am sorry. 
We were great together for those first 4 months, before it got so intense. And who knows, maybe we can go back to that. I guess that's what i'm pulling for. the relationship that is loose and trusting, Not obsessive or too distant or too intense at all. 
i guess that is how we are right now...just without the titles.
maybe it is the titles that bind us into thinking we are doomed for disaster and heartbreak.
and if that is the case, then i would rather do without them.
i guess all i really know is how i feel... and when you hold me, i melt. when i think about you, i get excited (in more than one way!) and when i look into your eyes i see sooooo much... an amazing person who deserves the best, even if he disagrees. 
whatever happens, know u can always call, no matter what, and i'll be there for you..."

and the same thing is broken again. 
it has only been 6 ays since i got my car back people!!

i find it amusing that i only come on here to vent or when i am super happy. the ironic part is that sometime i am on livejournal to do both of those things...like right now.

my car is broken, 
again
i have homework coming out of my ears
and i am sooo nervous about my grades.
i hate the uncertainty of college, 
how you cant track your grades all semester like in high school
ahhhhh high school
i love it here, 
but shit is going crazy at my townhouse
and it makes me want to scream
or at least throw something. ha
and money...ohhh money.
i dont have any
and i know they say it cant make you happy, but in this society in this day....it really could.
i could get in my car and go see him whenever i wanted to. 
and i wouldnt be so fucking stressed all of the time so i would generally be better off.
and i wouldnt drink so much.
that's a big fat lie, but i like drinking, even though i really need to cut it down a lot.
i feel like i havent been sober in a long long time.
my mom is mad at me. 
over money..... go figure.

and even though all of this is going on, 
all i can focus on is him.
he is the only thing that makes me smile...
and when i am with him, nothing else concerns me because i get the vibe that everything will end up OK no matter what it is. we really have something special. i can tell when i look into his eyes, and see his soul.
he's wonderful, and i cant handle being away from him....
at least i have the pictures....hahaha"

I no longer can drink Coca Cola because it can remove toilet stains.

I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr Pepper since the people who make these products are atheists who refuse to put ""Under God"" on their cans.

I no longer use Saran wrap in the microwave because it causes cancer.

I no longer check the coin return on pay phones because I could be
pricked with a needle infected with AIDS.

I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.

I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will drug me with a perfume sample and rob me.

I no longer receive packages from UPS or FedEx since they are actually Al Qaeda in disguise.

I no longer shop at Target since they are French and don't support our troops.

I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me to dial a stupid number for which I will get the phone bill from hell with calls to Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore, and Uzbekistan.

I no longer eat prepackaged foods because the estrogens they contain will turn me gay.

I no longer eat KFC because their chickens are actually horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers.

I no longer go to bars because someone will drug me and take my kidneys and leave me taking a nap in a bathtub full of ice.

Thanks to you, I have learned that God only answers my prayers if I
forward an email to 7 of my friends and make a wish within 5 minutes.

I no longer eat meat because PETA told me that the meat industry intentionly tries to kill their customers.

I no longer have any savings because I gave it to a sick girl who has been dying for the past seven years.

I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive the $15,000 that Microsoft and AOL are sending me for participating in their special e-mail program. I will now return the favor....

If you don't send this to at least 1200 people in the next 6
seconds, a large bird with diarrhea will fly over your head at 5:00 pm, the fleas of a thousand camels will infest your armpits, and you'll rip a nasty fart the next time you have sex, even though you'll never have sex for the next 100 years. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of a friend of a
friend's neighbor's cousin, and he's a lawyer ! ! I swear!"

"event","<p>In four days Nich and I will be dating for a year!&nbsp;I really can't be happier with him, it's been a perfect year with him. I love being able to see him ever single day and I love that I can fall asleep in his arms when ever I want. I love getting into stupid tv shows with him, well not stupid. The office and ghost hunters and it's always sunny, are the greatest things alive. I have never loved any one more than I do him. It's weird actully liking a guy that I love, I&nbsp;know that sounds weird, but it's true. I actullly love to be with Nich and yes we get in fights, but we both know its because we are always around eachother. I love him more than anything. This week is going to be hard without him, I wish he could be with me on thanksgiving. I just wish I could always be with him. I never knew love could be this good. I never knew I would ever find anyone like Nich. After dating Ryan for two years, its weird seeing me this happy, I just always thought all guys were jack asses, but this one isn't and Iove that. I love that I&nbsp;can be this good with him and so confortable. I can open up a little bit more than I&nbsp;have before. It's just amazing that I can just put up with Nich, and he is just not a dick, which is awesome. I&nbsp;love the kid and I love the way he makes me feel, I love you Nich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><span style=""color: #0000ff""><span style=""font-size: xx-large"">YOU&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;BEST, I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;YOU.</span></span><span style=""color: #33cccc""><br /></span>Moving on...

Those kids have been a big part of my life and it's going to be so hard not to see their little cute faces. I won't be able to pick on them any more. It is going to be so hard and I&nbsp;hate it. I love them and I&nbsp;know they love us. I&nbsp;don't want them to go back to that horrible life style. I&nbsp;want them to stay with us.</p>"

"event","<p>I have a few things I so need to get off my mind. I don't know who to talk to, I got Nich, but its so hard to just bring this up.&nbsp;It's just hard to tell him why&nbsp;I can't sleep at night and what has been driving me crazy. I&nbsp;don't know why I can't tell him, I don't want to get down in front of him, I don't want to hear it's going to get easier, cause it really hasn't. Maybe I should tell you what I have been talking about. Every time I get a phone call from my mom or dad the one thing that pops into my head is, Something happened to papa, every time my phone vibrates in class, I'm on the edge of my seat saying to myself, he is ok. I&nbsp;couldn't sleep last night, cause I couldn't get him out of my mind. I&nbsp;couldn't stop thinking about him. I&nbsp;don't know why I keep thinking about this, but when I lay my head down I just see his face. I don't know it's really eating me up and who do I talk to. I talk to vona, but shes always happy and I really don't want to talk about this and bring us down.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have Sara, but what do I say without bringing her down. I guess I need to step up and start opening up to Nich. Man I don't know why I&nbsp;can't, its not just him. It's so hard for me to open up and talk to someone.<br /><br />School isn't to bad, I'm starting to get that usless information stuck in my head. I feel like I'm actually doing something now. Psych is so boring, but I am starting to get into it. It's weird that this is what my life is coming down too. By the time I finish school I am going to have so much useluss information about the human body and our brain. And how to make weird chemical experience. It's so exciting to see what my future holds. There are really not anyone to make friends with, everyone is people that I will hate for ever. They are kids that are loud and yelling every 5 seconds. OH&nbsp;MY&nbsp;GOD! They are so annoying. I&nbsp;hate the kids here, but I love Nich so that is all that matters any more.<br /><br />Vona I really miss you and this is so hard not talking to you every day. It's so hard that you arent here for me any day I need you and I'm not here for you. It's hard not having you tell me all your stories. I know you will never replace me and I know I won't ever replace you. It's just so hard not seeing you. It has been for ever and last night it was bothering me so bad. I couldn't be with you on your birthday dang I&nbsp;can't be with you. I just wish I had a car, cause I would so come and see you as much as I could.<br /><br />Sara Mario used to kick ass. I remember how you use to stay up with me and deal with me and nich, till you couldn't stay up no more. I remeber how close we used to be. It is so weird how we aren't any more. I'm glad we still talk, its not like we are forgeting about eachother and I'm glad. I miss the good old days where we could just talk and talk, where we could stay up all night just to do nothing. I&nbsp;miss my&nbsp;other bestfriend.<br /><br />Nich I am so glad you are here. I so wouldn't know what to do with out you. You are my everything and I wouldn't change anything about us. you make me so happy. I am so glad that&nbsp;push me to do the things I need to get done. Like sleep that I should be getting. I am so glad we are together every day. I still miss you just as much. I love you babe, so much.<br /><br />Goodnight Guys.</p>"

They aren't going to be there to share all of my secrets too. Dang my best friend is going so far away and the question that keeps popping in my head is, are we still going to be friends when it's all done. Come on fucking 4 hours away. I don't think this could be harder. I am really close to tears and it's weird cause as many times as I want to cry about loosing you I really can't do it. It really hasn't hit me that you will be so far away. I'm so glad you are going to school and all and I'm really happy that you are going to a school you want. I just am not fucking ready to make new friends. Vona I don't want you out of my life. Last year we cried and cried about me leaving, but I didn't go anywhere and now that its happening I really don't know what to do. I want to hang out with you so much, but I worked all summer and so did you. Dang I just don't want to not see you. Vona, you mean so much to me. I'm just going to miss you kid.<br /><br />Sara let's not lie we really hate eachother, but I'm so going to miss you. I'm going to miss staying up talking when we just can't go back to sleep. Who am I going to talk to about how I really feel about Papa and grandpal. Who's going to be there to drive me crazy every second. We only got one week left, can we please just forget what has happened in the last two years and just pretend like we are still the friends we were when you moved in. Can we just pretend that were close. Can we stay up and cry cause we are going diffrent ways. I know we both treated eachother&nbsp; like shit this year and I just want one week of us liking eachother. I'm going to miss you.<br />&nbsp;day.<br />One thing I'm excited for is being wtih Nich every day.</p>"

I wanted to go to Matts grad party and my mom is like no there is drinking, Sara told her that, so she wouldn't have to go. Once again proving Sara's a great friend. So I was like I don't know if there is and mom was like call and I was like ok. She was like how about you stayed at Nich's for two days and I understand work, but you haven't been home. OK FUCKING GOING TO NICH'S AND FUCKING WORK. I fucking never get to go to Nich's and shes going to through that in there. Sara gets to go to Nina's but she doesn't do shit ever. Sara is gone from this house more than I am, including when I go to work. This is fucking not fare Sara gets to do shit all the time and I never do. How is that fare. I work and Nich comes over and once a month I go to his house. How many grad party has Sara's been to. And don't fucking act like there won't be beer and Nina's cause there will be.

Reason fucking two I hate my life.
Nich is in Hungry and I really hope he is having fun. I just miss him so much. I never am going to get to talk to him. I really can't stop crying right now, for both reasons. I miss him so much. He is so good to me. I'd be so fine If I could just talk to him once a day and I can't. I'm trying to keep busy, but I can't here. Nicholas I miss you so much."

"event","&nbsp;I went and seen Papa today. Alyssa was there and she was annoying me so much. It was really hard seeing Papa today. He kept talking about how he knows he isn't going to be around much longer. He told me he just wants to be around to see his first great grand kid, which is coming in August and he was like I know I'm not going to be around for that. I had to leave so early and I didn't want to. I just wanted to stay and talk to him. I miss my Papa so fucking much. I think people know when they are going to die, but I really don't want to say that. I have never lost anyone close to me other than my uncle, but I remember nothing from that. I'm afraid to go through this pain. I had no one to talk to before I went to work about it, so I had to bite me tounge all day and hold back my tears. I just wanted to cry all day at work. I don't want to have to deal with this, but I know it is going to come some day. I hate this. I love Papa and I don't even show him. I put no effort in going to see him. I feel like I could do so much more with him, but the truth is.... I'm scared. I'm scared of getting closer. He's my grandpal and I love him. I wish I could make his pain go away.

I need to smile now. I need to tell you how great of a boyfriend I have. I need to get my mind off of things.

So yesterday I went over to Nich's and it was so amazing. He cooked me dinner and breakfast this morning. We stayed up all night. We went on a walk and to a playground. We sat and talked for hours. We talked about everything. It was so great. I love just talking to him and telling him stupid stories, I love even more that he listens. I really could not be more happier then I am when I'm with him. He just knows how to make me smile and laugh and feel so good about myself. He deserves more wrote about him, but my back is killing me so I need to use my heating pad. Nicholas, I love you.

Vona thanks for being my best friend and telling me shit. Thanks for letting me tell you shit. Thanks for staying up and actully making something out of our last summer together.

Sara thanks for lying to us again. You are everything I look for in a friend. How do you just lie to our faces. I'm so sick of this. I can't wait till you go off to college and better off, I hope you for get about me."

I just keep remembering the time Gina stayed at my house and all I remember is her laying on the floor by the pole and me just laying next to her. I keep remembering the time she bought me a birthday present like 3 years ago, I don't remember what it was, but it came in this orange bag with sparkle&nbsp;ballons. I kept it. I never keep bags, but I kept this one and I still have it. I can't stop thinking about that bag. I can't stop thinking about the time I seen her at discount tires not to long ago and all we did was wave.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's so hard, because these kids, used to be my bestfriends.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about Rachel and how much her mom hated me. I can't stop thinking about the times I had to sneak into her house. Or&nbsp; the tea fights Suzy and Rachel and I always got into. I can't stop thinking about the time we went to Canton with her&nbsp;brothers and how I got a American Hi-Fi CD and she got Goldfinger. I remember all the pointless times we all just sat on the computer. Or the time we went to that Church thing and Larry wouldn't stop laughing. I can't stop thinking about every single moment I had with Rachel. I can't stop trying to figure out why we all grew apart. ALL of us did.<br /><br /></font><font size=""5"">It makes you think about the life you led, shit you've done, the things you've said.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2"">I can't stop thinking about Misty and how I wish we still hung out.

Just cause I don't want the awkward conversations. I miss all of you guys. I miss the times, when drugs weren't everyones life.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about how Vona could of been in that car. I can't stop thinking about how we have started to grow apart. I can't stop thinking about how easy it is to take a life away. I can't stop thinking about how I really don't want to drive. I can't stop thinking about how important Vona is to me. I can't stop thinking about how much I wish I was still friends with all the friends&nbsp;that are never around. Vona I'm going to against your saying, if you don't need me, I don't need you. No I need my old friends now. I need to hang out with them atleast once a year. Vona I might of not shown this, but I need you kid.<br /><br />Now I'm going to go think to myself and cry some more.

He takes things so rough and I do too, but I'm afraid I'm going to loose him for all the wrongs reasons. We are so good when we are together, but the minute we are apart things fall apart. I don't want that. I don't want him to be in a bad mood cause I can't be there with him and the same goes for me. He is my everything. I don't care how long we have been going out. I love him so much and I'd be shit without him. I don't want him to think it's better for me to find a guy there, because I don't want that at all. I don't want no one else and he just wants whats best for me. <font size=""5"">HE IS THE BEST FOR ME</font>. He means <font size=""5"">EVERYTHING</font> to me. We are so perfect for eachother. You know how you just know. I never understood that till now. I know life would suck without him I'm not saying we are going to run off and get married or if we would even make it that long. All I know is I'm not ready to give him up. I hope we can make for a long time. I want to. I have faith in us, now he just needs some. I want us to be able to talk when I'm at college, like I mean I want to be able to talk about movies and music and everything that happens in our lifes. I want to be able to laugh on the phone and when get to the I love you, then I want us to get our sad voices. I don't always want us to be sad when we miss eachother. I want to miss him, but still be able to talk to him. You know what I mean. I'm not giving him up because I'm leaveing. That is not happening at all.&nbsp; <font size=""5"">I LOVE YOU NICHOLAS PETER BUZALKA</font>.<br /><br />Moving on to what I said earlier.....<br />Now I have to wait till August to leave. I'm down with that, but I want to be able to spend as much time with my boo as we can. I want to have some time to myself. UGH I want to be with my boo, that's all there is to it.<br /><br />Ok about my mom. I'm so sick of hearing her mouth. I don't want to get the bitch speach everytime I piss her off. You know how much we fight, a lot. It's not even funny how much we fight. I think that's all now. I got things to do.<br /><br />Nich I love you and our feelings aren't going to change. We will grow to love eachother so much more after this. You will get your life in order babe, just give it some time."

I'm so sick of always being compared to someone. Sorry, but I did just as good in high school as Sara does. Does she really not remember how much I busted my ass for good grades. Does she not realize I did every extra thing in high school. I had time to kill, but I still took 30 classes. I graduated with 30 criedts, one less than Ricky. So how am I a fuck up? Just tell me how I am, cause I'm dying to know. I'm sick of hearing about Ricky making it on his own. OK Just Kidding. He just started paying bills this year. She has paid for everything and she complains about me. I need to save my money, so I can get an appartment, but I know she is just going to take all my money, cause she's broke and never has enough money. I would be ok with it, but I need out of this house. AKA I need money. I don't want to be like Angel and my mom just makes out to be like her. Well maybe I do want to. Angel pays for everything herself. She doesn't need mom or a man. Even though she's stuck with a dick. I just want out of here. I'm so sick of hearing, are you and Nich moving in together. OK no, we have only been dating 5 months. Maybe in like a year and a half, I'll be down with it. But I'm not going to do that. I know Nich and I are going to see eachother daily, but still.I know my mom is going to be so pissed when I move out, but I can't stay here. I&nbsp; can't take this any longer.

I'm really not going to be excited when I get a job too.<br /><br />Well I want a job so bad, I want to have money to go see Nich when I want to. I want to have money so DSC can take pointless trips to Belden to see Chris and Jack. I want to have money to go to Chris shows so he will like us more. When Sara and I had a job, we went places all the time. I want money for shows. I want money so I can take Court and MT to Ceader Point. Well I just want to go and Nich is scared of roller costers, and they both need out. I can't get a job. I have had so many interviews and nothing. People hate me so much and I don't know why.

I wish you weren't sick, I just want to come give you a hug because you are going to be so far away and we don't do phones so well.&nbsp; We are so hanging out a lot this summer. It just hit me that in 4 months you will be so far away from me. We need to get Polar Pop more often and chips and sleep over at your house. We need to have our talk we have before we fall asleep, so I can ramble about Nich and you can ramble about him(I think that was his name.) We need to swim and cry together. Vona I want to be there for you when ever you need me next year. I don't even care. I love you best friend. I don't know what I'm going to do with out you. I remeber last year when we thought I was going away, this is worse. i need 7 minutes so I can clear my eyes.<br /><br />Dino- Squad. We need to make a new CD. We have so many songs we need to write. We need to sit down with a mic and just scream. No one needs lyrics. We need to take more pictures and go to more random peoples houses. We need to do so much this summer.<br /><br />Sara I don't have much to say. It's sad about you and Tony. There was like two of your ""boyfriends"" I liked and he was one of them. You liked him so much at first and you talked about him so much and then I seen it start to change. Just like it does with all the other guys. I know he broke up with you, but he did that for a reason. He knew it was coming. He knew the way you acted around him. I know it's both of your faults you failed. Just he treated you so well.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love you so&nbsp; much Nicholas. I need to hurry yours up because my mom is shouting for me. You mean so much to me. We have been through a lot in the almost 5 months. we've had challenging fights, but we made it work. We got through all of them. I'm so glad we did. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you so much. Nicholas you are the best thing to ever happen to me. I love you.</p>"

I have to clean my fish tank. MT said its to cloudy and they can die from that.

So I went and seen Papa the last two days. I really love seeing him, but when I leave it's so hard. I know that I need to spend all the time with him I can, but sometimes I can't bring myself to do that. Like I really can't explain how I feel. It's just so hard seeing him. My mom and I was talking about atleast he has a chance to say goodbye. I told her that I'm sure he rather just die already. I know that's harsh, but what would you want. He's spending every day just waiting for when he doesn't wake up. I know how I feel and I'm not even going through what he is. In June he finds out how much they cancer has spread. I want to go with him, but I don't know if I could. I love him so much, I don't want to see him go.

Like he's never been there for any of us. Sometimes I just want to just forget about him, when I think of all the things he did to my mom as a child or how he could never ever come pick us up cause he was always drunk. I never had any grandparents in my life. I know when I think about that I really don't mean it. I still have those thought. I know I love Papa and I know I will never for get about him or just stop showing up. I still think about it sometimes. UGH.

I hate thinking about this, but latley I can't stop. Between this college and hyperthyroid, my mind is always going, and I just want to stop. I hate thinking."

I really don't know how my mom and Sara is going to take&nbsp;it. College is about me though and I know that. But Dino- Squad all being apart will be rough.&nbsp; 

There is no way I am going to Youngstown. This would be so far away from Nich. I know I shouldn't base this on that, but he means that much to me. It's also a really shitty town. Like bad. 

Salem is just lame. 

Stark is perfect, but I don't want to live at home. I don't want to live by myself. I can't even afford an apartment. Nich said I can get a loan to help out with that. My mom is just going to think this is because of Nich is going there. He doesn't have anything to do with physical therapy. You know? But that's what she's going say. She's going to convince me not to do what I want. I have to do this for me though. I really want to do this.&nbsp; 

I know it's a lot of work, but everything is. I want to have money and I want to help people. I want to do this. UGH I just don't want to deal with my mom.&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;it has been a long time, I have not wrote in this thing for ever. I just kinda for got that this makes me feel so much better. I'm fucking freaking out about Thursday. I'm scared on what's going to happen. It's not just the 1/20 people with cancer thing it's more if I have to get surgery, it's not even the surgery it's the sleeping medicine. Like there's a good chance I won't wake up. I know that won't happen. I don't even know if I have to get surgery. I know I'm going to have to do a whole bunch of test. Nich had a job offer at some thing for like a week and he'd have to work tomorrow, Thursday and Friday plus more. He told me that he wasn't sure what to do. I told him how I wanted him to take the job and that I'm freaking out about the doctors and he said, I'm not going to take it. Nothing is stopping me from being there with you, holding your hand kissing you on the cheek. I love him so god damn much. I can't explain at all how much he means to me. I have never been this happy with a boy. It's like perfection, more than that. We do have those down falls. Like his shoes ripped at Wal Mart and he was angry and he didn't talk, there's not a problem with him being angry but it just makes me think of Ryan, that's how it was all the time with us and I know Nich will never be like that but I just get so angry because I feel like I'm reliving that, even though it never last long. He went out to his car and he came back and kissed me on the cheek and said, i'm sorry I got angry. Then he's always like how can I be angry around a girl as amazing as you. He's so perfect. I love him so much. He was like I miss you so much now and it's only been a day, what am I going to do when I go to Hungry.&nbsp;Now I'm like damn he's going to be gone for like two weeks. I'm going into like deppression for those two weeks. It's so hard not&nbsp;seeing him for like a day.&nbsp; I'm so crazy for that boy. Like madly&nbsp;"

I am so worried about him. I don't want him to do something stupid. I wouldn't mind him living in Ohio, I'd really enjoy it. I have a bad feeling he just wants to move here, because of me. I don't want him to through his future away because of me. I know he would go back to school here, but I don't want to give up something he loves for me. He says its because his family and bestfriend and me are all in Ohio he has nothing left in PA. He hates PA so much. He has already told me. UGH I don't know what to tell him! I'd love for him to be closer to me."

It's so diffrent we have gone many days without seeing him and it just feels like monday is never going to come. I just want him to drive up here like right now. I have never missed some one as much as I miss him...<br />I don't want to say I love him, because it's so early, but I just want to tell him and myself that. I don't know if this is love or if I just really like him. I never felt this way about Kris or Ryan and Kris and I went like a week to two weeks without seeing eachother. I can't tell him enough how much I miss him, and I don't want him to think I'm crazy for telling him, but he tells me just as much. It's to early for love, but man I like him way to much. I'm not ready to tell him I love him I'm not ready for him to tell me. It is way to soon even if we used to say it.<br /><br />Wed. when he was leaving I just wanted to cry, because I wasn't going to see him for the next 4 days, to tell you the truth I just want to cry every time he leaves, because I know how much I'm going to miss him.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><font size=""7"">I'M CRAZY FOR HIM</font></strong>"

"event","&nbsp;So yesterday Nich came over around 11ish. We watched the movie Snow.&nbsp; Then we went upstairs and you know. Then we went to pick up Sara and Vona, but before we left I needed to scrap my windows and I didn't have an scrapper, so he went into his car and got one and he scraped my windows, it was so cute. Who scraps their girlfriend windows. He's so cute. So around 530 we left to go to his parents house. Soon as I seen the Wadsworth exit I started freaking out. My heart was beating so fast and I don't know why. But we arrived to his parents house and his mom was picking up the pizza so I talked to his dad and his brother, they were really nice. When Nich walked in he gave them both hugs and was like man I missed you bro. It was cute. We ended having pizza and after that they sat and talked. They told me stories about Nich and they are were funny. They kept making jokes like she might not be back, but I like him so much more. HIs family was so nice. Then his mom was like Nich I'm showing her the scrapt books and he was like MOM NO! and was like I hate you. She came down with 7 scrapt books, 7! and we looked at all of them. They just had fun embarssing him. Then we talked about Nich's future and college. It was sweet. Then they changed the cards and asked me questions about my future and I was like UHHHH. We didn't leave till 12 and my mom was like going to kill me and Nich was like we're going to make your mom mad and he was freaking out and I was like its okay I promise. We stopped at the gas station and he bought me a&nbsp;some OJ&nbsp;and he&nbsp;got coffee. We were driving home and hes like man this sucks we didn't get to spend any time together today just us and he ased if&nbsp;he could come up today and I was like hell yea.

"event","&nbsp;Things are going really great right now. I have a new boyfriend and he is so amazing. I really like him. I've been thinking about when Ryan and I started dating, I don't remember being this happy. Like Nich and I get a long so well and I don't think it's because we jus started dating because we have been like this for awhile. As soon as we started talking the first time, we hit it off really well and it has always been like this. I have know idea if that makes science.

I am really happy right now. Nich makes me smile all the time. I never stop. When he tells me when he has Wed. off, I get so excited and I tell everyone and I think my family just doesn't care. But then when he's on his way I get butterflies in my stomache. Every time we kiss I have that feeling. I can't explain it, but I know it's a wonderful feeling. I miss that kid every second we're not talking. As the night comes to an end, we don't want to say goodbye to eachother. Last night we got done saying bye like 10 times and he gives me a hug and we are holding hands and he like starts walking away and he goes ""Damn why do you have to be so hard to say goodbye too."" and I pull him back and gives him one more kiss that lead into more. I know I love to ramble about Nich and if it bores you, but I can't help it.

Sara I just don't think you like Nich that much so I don't like talking to him about you. I know you will listen, but I don't kow.&nbsp;

Vona I love you because I can go to you for anything. I love trying to help you figure out whats up with Jake."

"event","&nbsp;So I have been thinking about my future a lot. I really don't know what I want to go to collage for. I want to be a journalist, photographer and social worker. How can I do all three. the only reason I don't want to do journalism is because I don't want to travel. I know I won't have too. I want to be a journalism for bands. How am I suppose to know if I will even be into music 10 years down the road. I will be though.&nbsp; I want to have a good income, I don't want to have to deal with what my parents have to every day and a social worker brings in the most income. I would love to be a social worker and work with kids, but I love to write. I love to interview people. I don't know why, I wish I was in school just for the journalism part. I miss writing, I miss having the time to write stories and I know I have time now and that is what I want to work on. I want to have the story I'm working on done by the end of the summer. I think It would have to be a book though for what I want to do. I WANT TO WRITE, but I have bad grammar skills, well that's what Sara is there for. I'm really glad Sara and I decided to live together and Vona if you go to Kent... you're joining us.&nbsp;

I'm really excited to start working on my future. Even though it scares me. I can't wait to find that guy... I want to get marry right after collage, so I need to find a mate like now! hahha&nbsp;

Now on to the boy I am falling for madly. OMG I CAN""T WAIT TO SEE HIM. He's getting a day off soon. He's coming to WV with my family and I just have to tell my mom. I think she knows who I am talking to, well I'm most positive. I want to tell her, but I want to wait a week so I can be like we just started talking... Then she doesn't assume I broke up with Ryan for him, even though I didn't. I broke up with Ryan because I knew he wasn't the one and it's time for me to start looking for that one. I'm better off without him anyways.

WHAT UP DOG?

Nicholas makes me so happy. I love hearing his voice, his lauch and his&nbsp; shivering teeth when he's out in the cold at 1 AM, just so he can talk to me. I can't even type this, I just need to tell someone, even though I tell vona everything. He says the greatest stuff. He tell me how much he misses me. I can't wait to see this kid. We talk aobut making outl ike all the time. and how neither of us is going to talk for the first two hours, because we're so shy. and how we are going to watch heroes and movies and not pay attention to them.

It makes me more happy that I can tell Courtney about this stuff. I don'n know why, I just feel more connected to here.

""This isn't working out for you and me, the truth is I'm to tired to play pretend. This is goodbye this is the end.""

I told him how much I have thought about him and how I want us to be friends. He was like I won't hit on you and I was like thats good and we can't tell eachother how amazing we are and he was like okay but just for the record we are amazing. I told him about how good Ryan and I are doing. I told him I was going to mess shit up with ryan and he was like no you won't don't worry about it. It was really good to talk to him.

Today was Ryan and I two year annerversity and it was weird. I got so mad at him for nothing. It was because he didn't seem to care. Once we talked about it I was happier then ever. We had a talk about me going off to college and how he is going to have to push me too meet deadlines and do my work.

I'm so happy with him. We talked about the futuer. Like when do we want to have kids and if we are going to get married and I said of course and he said you will probably have to ask me... I laughed. Then we talked about how many kids we want. He told me Zaq is fine he just won't love him. It's crazy to talk about, but it makes me happy. It's not set in stone it's just there to make us both look into our future.
I never thought we'd be this far.
And who knows if we will make it as far as we both want it to go at this point.

There's nothing excited in my life you guys would care about. I care about it a lot and I'm not asking my friends to care or anything, but I'm going to say what's been going down and how happy I am.

Let's start off with one of the most important thing in my life. Ryan:
I really haven't been happier. Yesterday we got in a fight and today just made me feel so much better. It was the first fight that we've had that has lasted more than an hour. It scared him. He thougt that I'd be breaking up with him because this is what happened last time. He told me he trust me he just worries. He has every reason to get worried, so I don't plame him. We have been saying I love you often. Today I was giving him a kiss and it just came out of my mouth. This time is not the same. I can picture us being together a year from now. I'm not making promises, I just hope that's where we will be a year from now. Ahh I feel so diffrent. If this is love, then I'm going to be one happy women when I'm 85. The only thing that still scares me is, Kim. I know I should talk to him about it, but what to I say. He doesn't even know she's back in Ohio. I'm so scared I'm going to loose him for her. I don't know why because I know how we feel about eachother, but I still get scared. I think it's because there are so many girls that are more cute and smarter. I just need to realize Ryan's not like me. What I mean by that is the whole Nick thing. Ahh I can't stop thinking about him. I want to spend so much time with him.

Alright now I'm going to move on to Warped Tour:
That pretty much just makes me happy just by saying the word, even if it brings up pain along with it. So the first waprped got rained out. It was okay. The second warped was so much better. I liked that I had Ricky there, we hang out more than my friends and I do at shows. What made the second warped better was because I had Ryan there with me. I don't he was cool about it, he didn't complain and he came and seen bands that I wanted to see and didn't complain, he enjoyed it. Which made our day so much better. Flogging Molly had to be the greatest set. I can't even explain it. Then Big D and The Rocket Summer were amazing too.

Now lets move on to the Best of Years:
So stoked for Friday. What happened to Devon and I'm so glad he's gone, but now her friend Don is going to hate her. This shit just got real."

"event","Saturday Ryan and I had a heart to heart conversation. It was amazing, we opened up a lot. It started while we were waiting to pick up food, I asked him what was wrong and he explained how he felt, with out telling me. He was like it's hard and I never did blah blah blah and I was like Ryan that did not tell me anything. Then he said Miranda, I don't know, I feel really different about you today, I think it's just today, it's been really weird, I've never felt like this before and this wasn't in a good way. So I started crying and the guy came out and gave us the food and I told him we would talk about it in a minute, I didn't want my family to know anything was wrong.&nbsp;

We went and sat behind his truck and he started talking about how he didn't know why he felt like this, like he didn't want to be with me way, but I started to cry, like deeply crying. Then after like 3 minutes, he goes Miranda I don't even know why I said anything, because I don't feel like it now. That made me cry more. He told me that it wasn't really anything big, he's just always scared of me ending the relationship. I tell him I'm not going to, but I've told him that before and I ended up lying to him. I really don't think I could ever do that to him. He means so much to me, it's not even funny. Anyways then I told him how I always feel like I don't deserve him and that he should of never of taken me back. I was like Ryan, believe me, I'm so glad we are back together, but I'm always afraid that I'm going to fuck up again. I told him that theres many times I just want to cry when I look at him because I feel like such a bitch for what I've done to him. He thought I was trying to get that I wanted it to end. I was like Ryan, no. Ryan I love you and he was like Miranda I love you too, and I have never stopped. Then we just hugged and I was still crying. He told me that he doesn't want me to feel that way. He took me back for a reason. Even though I think the reason is because no one can stop loving me..Hahaha that was a joke. Then we talked about a lot of things, not about one person, but about why and how I felt and what we could do to make things better, even though this time we both know things are going way to much better.

Tonight we were saying goodbye and we were talking about boys and shit and then he asked me if Nick was ever above him and I was like Ryan, no. Nick was just someone I had to talk about when I broke up with you. I told him that he just made me feel really good about myself. Then I told him I don't want Nick to get in our way of this relationship, he told me that he's not, but sometime there are questions he needs to know. I told him I really hate talking about Nick, but I want him to ask me anything he wants about him, because I don't want him to worry. Then he told me that once in awhile we need to have some more conversations like Saturday.

He asked me if he thinks we said I love you, to soon and I told him no and I asked him if he thought it was to soon for him and he said I wouldn't of said it If I didn't mean it and he asked me if I meant it and I was like of course, because I fucking do love him."

"event","So what do I want to say... ugh today was great and it was horrible. Today the family plus Vona and Ryan, went to Cleveland to do some family things. The ride up was nice, Ryan and I talked and Vona and MT was very entertaining. Once we got there, we were still in the car, we were trying to find a store for some gay thing. Ryan through a fit, not like I hate everyone, the fit I'm not talking to Miranda and I'm going to make her mad. I tryed to let it go, I tried to ask him what was wrong and he just kept saying nothing. After a half an hour later he apologied and said he has no idea why he does it, but he only does it around me. I asked him why and he had no idea.

We finally went swimming, Ryan swam for a little bit and then he went to ride his bike. Oh we also played frisbee in the water, just the two of us. It was mega nice. I love spending time with him. After he left, My dad, Ricky, Sara, DaVona, Brittany and I all played frisbee and swam and flirted with the life gaurd.

After that we went to this park and Da Pants and I went and washed our hair in the bathroom and then we got dressed. Ryan went to ride his bike some more, he does that often. Then I got mad at him because we weren't spending time together or something like that. Then we talked about it and he said he doesn't want me to break up with him for a stupid mistake he makes and I tried telling him that won't happen. Oh we headed off to Kiddy land and that's where we had our talk. Then he went ridding, because we made up.&nbsp;

After that we headed to Mc Donalds, the car ride there was pretty good we just talked. Once we got to Mc Donalds Vona and I were being annoying, because we were in a car all day. I saved Ryan a seat by me but then vona moved and he went and sat across from me, we already weren't really talking at this point. But the I asked him what his favorite part of the day was (I also asked Vona and Sara) and he said, just stop! In a really mean way and then we stopped talking. I went intoo the bathroom and cried because I didn't know what else to do.Then I went back out to finish eating and it was weird and depressing and I was just pissed.

We left to get into the car and we both said sorry, because we both were wrong. When we got into the van he was really not mad, but upset. and we said sorry like 593749374 times, but something was still wrong. So I gave him a huge hug because I didn't want us to get in the wrong kind of fight. Then he said Miranda just do it and I was like what are you talking about, he said you're going to break up with me, just do it. I was like Ryan listen to me, I'm not doing that and he put his head on my shoulders and said that's what you said last time. So I pulled his chin up to like look into his eyes and I said Ryan, nothing's going to happen this time, you don't have to believe me, but it's the truth. He just kept looking down and I was just trying to get the point through his head that I'm not ready to loose him again. Then things happened bad then it got good. We worked things out and he said the trust is comming back, but it's going to take a little longer. I tell him many times that he doesn't have to believe me, but I'm not lying. Then I said, Ryan what makes you happy, you need to cheer up and he looks up into my eyes and says, you make me happy. and I just wanted to break into tears. Then we were find.

Part of the problem is when Ryan thinks I'm going to break up with him because we got in a fight, I don't get mad and him. I get mad at myself. I get mad because I should of never let Ryan go, even though this relationship is better than ever. I'm mad because, it's my fault he can't trust me, It's my fault that we get in these fights because of the past. I wish I could make him understand, he's mine now and for awhile."

"event","So I feel I have to be honest with my two best friends. It's not that I haven't, but there's this one thing that's been on my mind and I just shove it to the side to make you two happy. Alright how do I say this. I'm just going to use names instead of pissing around.&nbsp; 

But every since that last goodbye I haven't got him off my mind. I know I pretend like I don't even think of him, but when you guys tell me to call him (jokingly) I just want to get him on the phone. While making out with Brandon I was even thinking about him. Now I don't know where to go. I'm going to do something that's going to piss you guys off. We talked on the phone for 5 hours about nothing till the end then we talked for 2 hours about where we were at and I know we both want to re-join. He hasn't stopped thinking about me. 

I fucking loved that kid and I think I still do. I just can't keep thinking. I have to get some reality back into my life.&nbsp; 

The only the question I have is, why does he always for give me? 

Guy I'm sorry I know what I said and how I told you I felt about him, but the truth is coming out. Now I'm going to sit back and wait for my two best friends, Vona and Sara to tell me how they feel. I fucking love you guys."

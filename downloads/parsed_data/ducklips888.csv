<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So, this is going to come to you in a suprised way... Ok, so im going to start with last night and work my way up... here it goes:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Last night aound 6:30 or so me and Adam were on the phone but we werent talking kinda like one of the long akward silences that go on for ever. Well, i told him to call me back when he was dont watching tv. And yet we still werent talking, so now i was really upset and i asked him what was wrong and he still insisted that nothing was wrong at all so i was gonna let it go but we <EM>still</EM> werent talking so i asked him what was going on and he said nuthin then the argument got worse as i told him that it felt like everything i said or did today he would yell at me for. So now we were both upset and we got into the argument of what we want. He kept saying he didnt know what he wanted which hurt cuz that means that he wasnt sure about us anymore. So finally i asked him if he was gonna talk and he said he didnt know so i told him to call when he did know...which i prob. shouldnt have done cuz it only made things worse. And which really hurt me is he never called back. I didnt sleep at all and i was crying like u would never believe. So this morning when he walks up to me at school i dont exactlly do what i norm do which is give him and everlasting hug and a big smooch. I just looked at him and then i ignored him which was another big no no. So, When i had to leave to walk to the Red campus( we have 2 campuses and i have one class at the red but i always get off at the gray to see him) He came after me and he was all pissed and said he couldnt do this anymore. Those words hurt me like hell. Tears filled my eyes like you wouldnt believe so i tried to walk away but he yelled my name and i knew if i walked away that'd be it so i stopped then he walked with me to the gray which is approx. a 15 minute walk. And we decided to go to my class and see if my teacher would let us talk. And he did so we sat there and talked..I cried like a baby <EM>again </EM>and i know it hurt him. He kept asking me to stop crying but he kept saying things like "" we cant do this"" and that he wanted me happy and he didnt think i was and ofcourse it just made me cry even more. So it came to a point that thingsg were gettin better...He was in a middle of a sentence telling me how sorry he was and how he wishes he was better for me and ofcourse me being to most loving person ever i grabbed his face and kissed him. It was the best kiss ive had in forever. It was so passionate..i dont know cant explain but it like took my broken heart and put it back together. Then we started talking again. And he was saying how things just werent good at home and he knows they arent at my home either and that he jsut wanted to be better for me and make me happy and how much he couldnt stand seeing my eyes all red and watery and my ""beautiful smile"" be a frown. He was trying to make me happy. So in the end we were ok. He was still upset but only because he felt bad cuz he hates hurting me. I could tell he was fighting to hold back his tears. I kinda wish he wouldve cried but only cuz i wanted to hold him and wipe them away. It is so sad but cute when a guy cries. I Love him to death and i felt so bad to see him like that. Sadly, my teacher wrote him a pass and he had to go back to his class. I didnt want to let him go. So we stood by the door for about 10 minutes talking still and saying how much we loved each other. I told him i was gonna be there for him forever. I made it a promise. I know i will be. So my teacher came out and then he had to go. My teacher yelled at me for not being in class so then i got lectured. but oh well i dont care.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So, after that class i walked to the creek(its inbetween the red and gray) to meet adam. He was waiting for me as usual and he held me forever and said he loved me. I was sitting there saying sumthin just jokingly and he put his finger on my lips and told me to shut up -lol i was like umm ok and he pulled me close and asked me to marry him. Im not into the whole getting on one knee thing so im glad he didnt do that. I said yes. I know that im young and i know that not very many people are going to approve. But there is only one person out there for you and you will only find them once. I have found mine. Wether yall dont agree or not but i know that we can make it and we will have a wonderful marriage. Full of alot of sex and love. He is my heart and soul. Although there isnt a ring, We still say that we are engaged. We dont have the money for a ring now. But, when we get to that point i will tell yall about it. So, how many of yall think im crazy?!?!? Please dont say anything mean, this means alot to me but i would like to know your thoughts on all this. </FONT></P>

"event","<FONT color=#993399>So im sittin at school thinkin about my weekend. Lets just say that i really hurt the one person that i love the most. I did alot of crying. Especially when i heard him doing it. I've never heard him cry or get close to it he's always said he'd call me back but this time i called him back and he was all upset. It killed my heart just like tore into peices as if it was thrown into a paper shredder omg it killed me. We are doing better now... ALOT better im just hoping that all the figthing and arguing will get better. It seems like its going too. Neither one of us enjoy yelling at each toher and then crying so we are gonna fix things. I made a big mistake and i almost lost him. Well, he said i wouldnt lose him but it sure did feel like it. He is so amazing i dont know what i'd do without him. Oh god i love him so much and i know i prob. sound like im just sum lil teenage girl in a lil crush. but it isnt like that with him. I Love Him. I would marry him. I want to be with him forever. I want to live a life with him. He is so sweet and understanding. God i love him so much but im gonna stop cuz im gonna upset myslef for hurtin him. Ok so umm yea anyways. Im prob not gonna post as often anymore. Im going to try though. </FONT>"

Me and Adam REALLY got into it yesterday, everything just kinda added up and i blew up on him.I felt bad but hey what can i say. I said sorry and all and things are better now. But, i almost broke up with him. I feel bad for bein a bitch but they were all things i needed to say or i wouldve held em in and i wouldnt have known what to do. Things are better now i still kinda think that he isnt happy and shit but he says he is. I really hope he is. He says he wants to make things up to me, and he asked me how he can do that but i really dont know i just really dont want him to be like that anymore i just dont want it to happen. I guess it would help if he'd hold me every once and awhile you know? I dont know things just arent the same right now. Im going through alot and he is trying to&nbsp; be better for me. I dont want him to feel like he has to do everything for me. it's not all about me. I dont want him to feel that way. Ugh i dont know im such i bitch sumtimes. He is prob. reading this right now too-lol its ok tho i dont care its prob a good thing so he can read how im feeling even tho im sure he knows ive told him over and over. well hopefully he isnt cuz im bout to tyoe bout carol. Ugh- i dont know what to do, i think ima try to be friends with her but im not sure i was willing but then i saw them hug at lunch and it hurt me. I try to not let it get to me but i dont know i cant explain it, i dont get like that with anybody else its just her. It just hurts me 4 sum reason. Like i saw it and i just wanted to turn around and walk away but i didnt cuz i know i got to face it cuz im not gonna make him stop hugging her they are friends and he cares about her. I guess i can deal with it as long as he dont get feelings and that is what im scared of. UGH!! why am i such a jealous person-it sux, well i g2g ttyl. Sumbody help me. </FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Well this weekend has been interesting. Well i guess since the last time i posted was thursday i will tell you everything that has happened since then. Friday was a decent day i actually dont remember anything about it besides that i was trying to get adam to skip and go to my luch but he didnt so my other friend did. And this one boy that we all call Figi kept lookin at me and it was pissin me off. I told Adam and adam has never liked him so of course now they are at each others throats. Friday night me and adam got into it pretty bad. He kept gettin off the phone with me and that i didnt mind it was the fact that at one point during the night i really needed to talk to him and he wouldnt listen and then he got off the phone..I was pretty hurt, but everything seemed fine before we got off the phone, i told him that i wasnt mad and everything was good. Saturday sucked ass i called adam not even thinkin about last night cuz i was gonna just put it behind us but he was all in a pissy mood and said that we needed a break. I understood why but he really caught me off gaurd and out of nowhere so ofcourse me bein the bitch that i am started crying and yelling at him cuz he wouldnt talk to me. I finally got off the phone with him and just let him be and then when i go thome from crystals house which is where i went to cry some more. I called him and then he was talking to me and said sorry and crap. I feel bad cuz i know he deserves better then me, he deserves someone that wont put him in that type of position. I dont know i kinda feel like im always doing sumthing wrong and like im always messing things up, he said sorry and that all that wasnt true. I Love him so much( adam if your reading this-I Love You Baby) Im really lucky to have him. So to everybody who is actually reading this we are good now. Sunday was OK i guess i went to and easter egg hunt with my family for my moms work, i got lots of candy cuz of course me being the wonderful person i am(not) did the egg hunt too with all the lil kids- its cool tho. Ok now for today, everything is going ok, i had fun this morning but we arent gonna go there(adam-lol) But now he dont feel good. I feel&nbsp; bad for him but he is so cute and sweet to me when he is sick. He is just so sweet cuz like he dont want to let go of me and shit i dont know i love it when he is like that, basically i just love it when he is holding me. Ok well my internet is still not working so i wont be able to post again until wednesday, Ok i'll write more later if anything happens at lunch.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>Im fuckin pissed, my damn computer isnt working so i ahve to post at school but i can only do it every other day. But anyway on another hand. Me and Adam really got into it last night, it was a bad day for me and he wasnt there so that pissed me off cuz he knew i was gonna have a bad day cuz of personal reasons and then i got over that and i was looking forward to talk to him on the phone and he finally called me at like 6 but he wasnt sober so it just felt like he didnt care about anything and i ended up going off on him cuz i felt like he just wasnt there for me anymore but ofcourse we talked last nigh i spilled my heart for him and he apoligized and now were good. Im happy i have a guy who cares about me and will deal with all my mood swings and bullshit. Oh and an update on the SouthWest thing. I have a feeling he is porb. gonna go im not mad at him but im sad that he is gonna leave me. He said that he wants to go for his grades and shit but that he dont want to leave cuz he'll miss me and shit. But he is right once he gets off restriction we will see each other every weekend its not like he is leaving the state or nuthin . I dont know im having mixed feelings about him leaving cuz i mean come on thats my baby and i dont want to lose him even though he says it wont happen that he loves me and there wont be anybody better for him but you know im still scared but yet i want him to go and get good grades and do better. I'm not gonna be selfish about it cuz i want him happy and if it takes that then im gonna deal with it. Well as for my grades- i have all a's and b's but i have 1 F im pissed im tryin so hard to pass that damn class. My friend sarah wants me to go to the military ball with her. It would be fun but im not really up to do it. Adam wants me to go so i can get out and have a lil fun since i cant leave my house often and adam got his liscence taken away so i wont be goin anywhere with him for awhile. I dont kno tho me and sarah arent all that close. I actually have grudges against her(she was tryin to get with adam when i was still talking to him) but we are OK now i guess. Well, i guess thats all for now hopefully my computer will start working soon.</P>

"event","<P>Sorry i havent posted in a long time. havent exactlly had anything to talk about well i guess i will tell you about my week that was pretty gay. Adam didnt come to school wednesday or thursday he came on friday but i only saw him for maybe a total of 20 minutes all day cuz he had a doc. appt or his arm cuz he broke it on tuesday night. That was the only thing that happened this week that is actually worth talking about. Last night me and Adam kinda&nbsp; got into a lil argument about him going to a different school, he wants to leave me and go to southwest. Im scard that if he does we wont work. I Love him to death but i tried that with one of my exes and when he left he ended up cheating on me. Im not saying Adam would do that but i am scared of what might happen cuz&nbsp;i wont be there to see what is going on for myself and i dont know anybody there. And plus another thing is then he wont be there when i need him. It'll just be hard and what is really making me mad is that the only reason i stayed in this damn school is so i could see him every day, and now he is thinking about leaving. Im afraid of losing him. Also, i know for&nbsp;a fact that if he leaves he is gonna be worried about me and what im doing, and i will get pissed for him always worrying and asking me about it and it will cause problems. But, he got all mad at me when i told him i didnt think it would work...ggrr...i swear im a bitch, i want him to be happy and all but if he leaves im nto happy and i want us to be happy together not apart. I dont know what to do i dont want him to think im trying to run his life or nuthin but i will prob. be mad at him even tho i want him happy i just dont know gggrr..long night</P>"

Ok, so today was a pretty decent day i guess. My dad tried yelling at me first thing this morning and that is part of the reason why me and adam got into that argument was cuz i was not in a good mood and was being distant sorry baby :(... But other then that it went well, Im pretty mad at this chik named Ashley cuz of some shit she's said im ready to kill her but to tell you the truth she isnt even worth my time.. Adam took pictures on a digital camera and they are cute so i was gonna put them on here but i cant cuz it is a little chip and he doesnt have the piece to put it in does anybody know what im talking about??/ if you do can u tell me where i can get the piece.. I got pretty mad at the snack machine today my damn finger got suck and i pulled it and it ripped the skin adn i was bleeding then i asked the teacher to go to the nurse to get a bandaid and she said wait 10 minutes....so while im sitting there i have blood sunning down my hand what a bitch i hate her....but ok on a more interesting subject- i was really horny towards the end of the day hhmm i know why too....after school adam was leaning up against me lol and i could feel him it was great... I didnt want to let him go ...haha.. i wish he could come over today..but he cant that sucks.. He was wondering why i was so touchy lol i never did tell him..well if he gets to read this then he'll know.. I asked him about making a video i wonder what he'll say...i would have fun haha.. I think he'll be into it he is pretty much down with anything. He was trying to take a pic of me today but i was trying to hide so he recorded me wat a butthead...well thats about it for now....damn progress reports come out soon :( i hope i did good oh yea and for everybody that had problems with the blue font did yall get to read all of the journals or should i repost them ok im out.</FONT>"

Well, sorry i havent updated i was wating for people to catch up on mine cuz i posted alot at one time and i thought that i'd be able to tell by the comments but i guess yall dont comment ggrr... So, anyway me and adam got into it this morning it wasnt anything too bad, he came back after i was walking to my class to apoligize he always seems to do that right when im on the verge of crying. perfect timing hun! lol Yea he thinks he isnt a good boyfriend but he is he is great. I Love him. Nobody is perfect neither am i and i know im not the best girlfriend either i dont like the fact that he thinks like that but i cant change that i tried tho. Well, damn dude all these pop ups keep coming up and there of nude chiks-lol. Anyway, im really happy for some reason im hyper.lol i dont know im weird but its all gravy baby, so anyway how is everybody else doing?!?!? Well, i dont have much to say i guess i could tell u what i want to do this weekend. Hmm...i want to see if adam wants to go anywhere...i dont want to stay home that would suck. I think he said he has a game this weekend maybe i'll go to that unless his parents are going then i wont be able too . :(&nbsp;&nbsp; i was hoping he would have a season pass to 6 flags then we could go together but im not sure if he's getting one. HMM.... I want to spend my b-day with him but im not sure if he wants too well no that but im not sure if he's gonna be able too. If he has a season pass by then thats what i wanna do but i dont kno....ggrr...ok well outa things to talk about....I'll&nbsp; write later if i have anything to say.</FONT>"

This event effected my life forever. Im going to write about my ex boyfriend his name is Jeff, im not giving any last names tho. He seemed like a nice guy he came into the school towards the end of the school year, well we started talking on Valentines day last year and he as great to me he treated me like i was everything in the world so ofcousre i fell for his words and thought i was in love. It wasnt until i refused to ahve sex that thigns got bad. I wasnt a virgin i just wasnt ready to do that with him, things got pretty bad that night he pushed me down a flight of stairs and i passed out. He apoligized and everythign and of course i forgave him well the week after i went to his house and we went to his friends house jeff got mad at me again and beat me with a metal pole. Then he left and went home i couldnt leave as i had nowhere to go and i was really out of it i was already drunk so i thgouth i could trust his friends so i stayed there, they drugged me and then took turns on me...i was raped by both of them. I never did tell the cops or anything i never thought it was a mistake and it made me feel like i did something wrong. It made me feel worthless. That is a feeling you could never get over. Then when i found out that i was pregnate with jeffs baby(i think it was his it couldve been his friends) i told him and he treated me like shit.. im not gonna go into detail on that but put it this way i didnt have the kid. I lied all the time about why i was constantlly coming to school with a black eye and all busted up. I blamed it on other people. I slipped into depression really fast and every time i tried to get out of the relationship he'd threaten me i was terrified of him so when he told me he was moving i jumped with joy. It was words that opened up a whole new life for me. We broke up and i was really depressed and felt like i wasnt worth anything. Adam ( my boyfriend now)&nbsp;started talking to me on the internet I went to the movies with him and even tho i was scared to death of guys i felt like i could trust adam. He made me feel comfortable. In the beginning i thought that the only reason i really as comfortable with him is cuz he made me feel special and tho i was scared that the same shit would happen again. I have liked adam since 8th grade and never thought i had a chance. So when he asked me out on July 28, 2003(also jeffs b-day)&nbsp;i was so happy. I said yes of course. And though me and him have our ups and downs we have never givin up on each other. He's been there for me through good, bad sad, tough, and confusing. He plays a major part in my life. He is the only reason im still here. He is also the only reason i decided to stay living in tx instead of going to alaska. If he ever leaves me i would never forgive him. He is my heart my soul, my world. He is everything to me. I thank him every day for the things he's done for me. He has never hit me he has never put me in a position i wouldnt want to be in. He is&nbsp;not only my boyfriend but my best friend. And though Jeff hurt me and broke my heart adam took it and put it back together and it is now safe cuz it dont works as just one it works as two and mine and his joined together and they work together as one. Jeff still calls and writes me and he says he is in town. I have nothing to do with him there is no feelings for him at all i want him to go through the same thing i did and feel the pain of a metal pole being jammed into your head im surprised im still living. </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#6633ff>I went out with adam tonite but things really didnt go right. I wanted to spend quality time with him. I wanted to hold him and him hold me back. That happened only when we were messing around. im really beginning to miss him and what we had and how it used to be. I really dont know what it is that i do wrong anymore just thinkin about all this is makin me cry dude. Yall just dont know how much it hurts when he is like this. In the beginning he was all sweet and then we left the house and he just changed he barely even talked to me. And then whenever i'd run my hand on him or sumthin he'd tell me to stop. It hurt really bad. One of his friends told me he's having mixed feelings and im starting to think that maybe he just isnt happy. I dont know what to do. I wish that i didnt feel like this but i do. I wish i could make him happy, and i wish that things wouldnt be like this. I just feel like holding him, and im sitting here cying fukin wanting him to be holding me. I g2g cant fuckin type. *PEACE*</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Guys are so hard to understand......Ok so my day was going all good.....I went out last night with adam and had alot of fun...(i miss all that) then i go home and go to sleep wake up this morning and go to 6 flags then i come home and call adam and he is in a good mood we talk about me being willing to give him head in the car-lol then we get off the phone and then he calls me back this is where things get bad. He is all upset about something and refuses to talk about it but agrees it has to do with me. He says he is trying to just let it go. I dont know what i did wrong and that feeling sucks ass. I wish he would be more comfortable talking to me about our problem but i guess he isnt and i guess i cant change that. it just really hurts me sometimes cuz im afraid he is gonna let too many things just be hidden and then they are all gonna build up and were gonna end up breaking up and i love him so much. He means the world to me. I dont know what to do. I wonder sometimes if he is really happy with me but that is only when we fight that i think that....he always reassuers me that he is but what am i supposed to think when he wont even talk to me. I dont know he wont be all pissed or anything he just wont be himself. GRR...i miss him dude so damn much. I wish i could live with him it's be great cuz then whenver one of us got mad we could just have make up sex. I miss last night and when he was holding me. GOD!! Yall, probablly are reading this and think im so damn stupid. Im not dude i swear but i really do miss him. I miss my baby! I need to see him. Oh-yea next time he is over here i will take a picture of us and put it on here. Well, i g2g he should be calling me back soon i hope he is in a good mood. I hate it when he is sad&nbsp; cuz it makes me sad too.&nbsp; ok i'll shut up now. </FONT></P>"

"event","Sorry about not posting lately, im not gonna say ive been bizy cuz id be lying but i just havent really had anything to talk about. I havent had much quality time with adam lately. Its starting to bug me actually. Somtimes it feels like were falling apart but i know that were not it just seems that way at times. We dont talk on the phone as much anymore either. And the only reason im not going places with him is cuz my mom isnt letting me. Hopefully she will be easier on us this spring break and let me go sumwhere with him so we can have some time to our selves. Im really happy he has stuck by me this past week, i've been a bitch lately, im being distant and that is prob. why im feelin like were falling apart. It has nothin to do with him really it is just that im arguing with one of my old good friends and it is getting to me and im just really tired of being lied to and shit like that. But im doing better now i just really need some time alone with him so that we can be alone-u kno? that hasnt happened in awhile. im not just talking about fucking tho-although im sure that will happen my inner thigh is startin to itch-lol but anyway, yall dont comment back much- comment back some more please and tell me what you think."

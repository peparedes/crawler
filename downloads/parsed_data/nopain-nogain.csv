"event","So.

My Kami is gone from me, of his own will, and Haruna and Juka stay. They have no say in the matter. It makes me feel a strong emotion - something far from anything I've really felt before.

I miss Kami.

But Camui came back... dear Gakuto-chan. I wanted to taste that pretty little blonde, and he charged in, wearing naught but slave robes (Of all things; jessh) and and an ivory mask. I have to say, I was amused. So we made a deal... I'm mildly disappointed in myself. I couldn't make him give up the redhead for even one day out of the ten.

Hnnnph. I will sooner or later."

"event","Something got Kami <i>sick</i>.

He's still curled up in his bed. In pain.

The kitchen staff - save for a few children and one old woman - has been sold. I hope they burn.

This means, of course, that I need more. I'm tempted just to make Klaha cook for me... but it's beneath his station. It's odd. Even slaves seem to have a pecking order.

Feh.

Truthfully, he's been a help with Kami-chan... Taking care of him when my job calls me away.

Whoever did this will die.."

"event","Klaha is still as willing as ever to be hurt. He begs for it. Mm. Blood is delicious.

Kami, however, is not eating enough.

... I heard that my dear former pet has aqquired a little princeling from another area.. Pale, they say. And timid. Rare little beast.

Daresay I should speak with him on lending me the child for a day or two."

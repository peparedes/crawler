"event","Go and see Science of Sleep. Michel Gondry has done it again. He has managed to capture the human mind in all it lovesick glory. The joy, the agony, the frustrations, the jealousies and the childlike innocence of a crush blossoming into something bigger. He lays it out on the screen in an unorthodox but satisfying way. Science is the closest portrayal to real life that I have seen in a quite a while, even though it uses surreal symbols and dream sequences to make its point. Life is not a inear narrative and neither is this film. Yes both have beginning  and ends but what goes on between these stages can take you any place at anytime.

The performances are fantastic,  Bernal and Gainbourg have great chemistry, there is plenty of comic relief and for those you who read this and love oversize props there are plenty of them in this flick. I won't get into more details for that would spoil it for you but do yourself a favour and go and check it out."

"event","So we all know and love the Nena song ""99 Luftballons"" in the original German and also the English version which is ""99 Red Balloons"" - well it turns out that none of us love it as much as someone from Pittsburgh, Pennylsvania. 

VH1 Classics have been running a fundraiser for victims of Katrina by auctioning off programming blocks for donations. Having  back to front body clock I do stuff early in the morning while most people are sleeping, so here I am ripping CD's at 2 in th emorning with the TV tuned to VH1 Classics when the viseo comes on for 99 Red Balloons, then followed by the video for 99 Luftballons so I'm thinking this is kool we get to see both versions of the song and that this person programming is pretty kool, some of the earlier songs they had programmed were interesting choices and a diverse mix of tunes. 

So what is the song that follows 99 Luftballons but of course 99 Red Balloons followed by 99 Luftballons followed by 99 Red Balloons followed by 99 Luftballons etc. To the internet I exclaim and sure enough on the 99 Luftballons entry in Wikipedia there is a paragraph explaining what had happened.

It turns out that someone in Pittsburgh donated $35,000 to the Katrina Fundraiser and for the second hour of their block programmed 99 Luffballons and 99 Red Ballons back to back for the whole hour. It turns out that the episode first aired on Sunday between 3pm and 4pm and was being repeated as I watch it now, yep I have now heard the song about 16 times as there's still 10 minutes until 3am. Anyway a couple of discussion points.

1 - What is this person saying or are they just being a smart ass - 99 Luffballons is an anti-war song related to the communist era but is the person who programmed it trying to make a statement against the current war. Or do they just love all things Germans. Is it someone going through an expensive divorce and using it to give the finger to their ex. Could it be that Ben Roethlisberger ( a good German name)is still drunk from the Superbowl and screwed up on his song requests. Or is it someone just looking for a quck tax write off.

After googling the song and VH1 it turns out they put out a press release on Friday that was picked by a few news outlets and that per hour it was $35,000 so that means the person actually spent $70,000 on the 2 hours."

"event","Haven't updated in along while. Partially out of laziness, partially out of having another writing outlet and partially because I ahve lots of things to say but find writing them either intimidating because of feeling the ned to write something witty or profund or that it is justa bunch of self indulgent, narcissitic, egocentric crap. having just read over sopme of my earlier entries I'm runnning with the idea that this place is somwhere to flush away random ideas and feelings. At the moment my modd is kinda melacholy but happy. 

Why - because my one of my favourite bars in the city has burnt to the ground but at the same time I'm celebrating the signing a lease on a new apartment in the city.

When I write the city I mean Manhattan. After 3 years of living in Astoria,Queens (which I do love and promise to come back and visit often thanks to the beer garden, friends and great restaurants) my old lady and I are moving on up (she's going to kill me for posting that but come on it's kinda funny). Our new home of marital bliss will be right off the upper level exit of the 59th street bridge - no joke we are two doors up from the corner

This of course has been tempered by the loss of The Raven, a place where we held our wedding reception, a place I could go no matter what mood knowing that there would be someone there to talk to. It was more than just bar or party place it was a community centre. I've met people from all walks of life in this little bar on 12th and A and had my fair share of hangovers thanks to the fine beer selction and generous shots. I've turned up as the gates are being raised for another day and have been there (many times I must add) as the gates are being closed on another night. I have found people to talk to about obscure Aussie indie rock, celebrated Australia Day in style, toasted my wedding, other people's weddings, numerous birthdays, sporting victories and of course just toasted being lucky enough to be one the Raven crowd. Damn it I'll miss the place, the good thing is that all the people are OK and that for the mean time the Boulevard is open and we can talk about what was and what will be.

Well that's about it, the new Cat Power is very kool, enjoying a band called Giant Drag - a mix of MBV, Pixies with their own quirks thrown in and strangely liking some ELO. By the way the new Belle and Sebastian is great."

"event","SO I get the call at 3am on Sunday morning (working in bars this is like getting a call at 10pm for people doing the 9-5) - want to go to the Jets game tonight they're playing the Saints at 8:30pm? My reply -  hell yeah!!Now a lot of sports fans would not get excited about going to see 2 teams who really suck this season play at a field in Jersey on late November night, but, for a boy from the other side of the world who misses his live contact sports the opportunity is too good to pass up. This is even more so when the best player the Jets have had this season is their punter (that pretty much sums up their season) and that I've seen this punter play Aussie Rules in Oz, so the chance to see him play in two elite sports was a must. Add to this that the seats were were 16 rows from the field and that they serve copious amounts of beer at the game.

 On arrival in the carpark my jaw dropped at the sight of the Trailer homes lined up with people BBQing and downing brews. Then there was the joy of seeing of port-a-potties dotted around the carpark, particularly for someone who had been sitting in a car from Manhattan for the last 3/4 of an hour after a few beers in a bar and another on the ride. Dodging the circling seagulls as they screamed down to pick up the left overs from the BBQ's, (including one small boy, who was duly dropped on to a port-a-potty by a particularly vicious feathered scavenger) we trooped into the stadium just in time to pick up some beers (and at Giants Stadium they have a fines election of beer not just your plain old name brands but some fancier ones) and watch the kick off. and where was I when the the big Aussie punter took his first punt I hear you ask - in the bathroom giving back to the world what I had drank that evening. But nt to worry it is the Jets and because they can't get any field position he manages to take 2 more punts in the quarter. 

Now this how pattern for the evening went, beer,yell go Jets or go Benny, bathroom, beers, yell, bathroom, beers. Now the game was a close one (surprise surprise seeing that both teams suck) but wasn't very excitng so the crowd got a little rowdy and all of a sudden late in the third quarter a few fights started to break out around the stadium, apparently, according to my friend with the season tickets, this is nothing unusal. Anyway the Jets lost and there was one player for the Saints (#34) who was as an A-grade asshole due his mocking of the crowd. I had the perfect retort for him,the only thing stopping me was that so many people had died tragically  in that natural disaster (it had to do with his Mama and her name). Anyway I had a hell of time and I'm looking to go again and this time I want to get picked up by the seagulls.

So apart from getting excited about my first game of American Football (I can't call it football, I can't even call my own games football, football truly is only soccer) the other thing I'm excited about is Patti SMith at BAM on Wednesday. She will be playing Horse in it's entirety with Tom Verlaine and Flea in addition to her regular band. Now I first heard this album back in 1990 when I was a 15 old in the burbs of Sydney trying to work out a way to escape. A local radio station played the album in it's entirety and though it is almost cliche to write it, as it had been written so many times before, it has one of the best opening lines of any album ever, to a 15 year old catholic school boy ""Jesus died for someone's sins but not mine"" was a call to arms and yell of victory. I wasn't alone in this anti-religion kick and there was more to the world than was provided by the places through which I moved. It wasn't long after this that I started to grow my hair and head out seeing bands whilst underage. 

Now Patti Smith was not the only influence at the time but that line had particular resonance with me and has stuck with me through the past 16 years. The first time I saw her live was in 1999 at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin and she blew me away, her passion was still so strong, intense and blinding, you wanted to march to the beat of her drum and follow her into the war against the injustices in the world. Now did I do that - no-  but again the passion of her words and performance stayed with me. This why I truly love music it can reach inside and conjure up the heady mix of discovery, freedom, times, places, thoughts, people, images that you thought you had forgotten or didn't believe in anymore. I have seen her 2 times since then and as a performer not a lot of people can come close to her fierce dedication to her art, particularly as she was seriously hurt back in the late 70's after falling off a stage during a show.

So my anticipation is high for Wednesday night (which is never a good thing as you inevitably disappointed) but having seen her before I am confident that it will be a show I'll never forget. And that is how Gridiron and Patti Smith converge in the world, one night I'm sitting in Giants Stadium slamming brews and dodging seagulls and then a few nights later plan to be in an a Opera House watching a punk rock poetess. Cheers to that I say"

"event","Last night I dreamt of Bowie and today I heard Bowie on stage with Arcade Fire doing Wake Up at Radio City Hill - even after a heart Mr David Jones still has it - I do wish now I had gone to that gig or the one in Central Park where once agin he made an appearance (on that day I had a good excuse - I was getting married!!)Anyway the live version is great and well worth searching out.

As for Bowie I dreamt about him last night, I was in bar that I was managing (but not the current one that I work at) when Bowie dropped by, encouraged by a crowd of 20 people he proceeded to do a song wothout a band by downloading backing tracks from the net, basically Bowie doing karaoake to his own songs. He played a couple of songs and went ot exit as other people began to leave, but after mumbling something about how Low is masterpiece to him (and he being less than impressed at this ass kisser), myself and someone else managed to convince him to get back up and do a whole set. He started to tell us how it was the first time he had performed live without a band and how liberating it was and how it gave him a new perspective on his songs. The funniest thing about the dream was that after waking up I was reading about some show or the other in Mojo and I was thinking that's nothing to the show that I saw the other day, to then only realise that I was thinking of the dream."

"event","Just thinking this morning how the senses can take you back to a time, a place that was so long ago and so far away that you think you do not remember or that you have left it all behind only to have it come back as though it happened last week. there I was sitting on my couch ripping a CD from a band called Glide and I was back to 1991, sneaking into pubs underage, boozing up and sneaking home drunk to find  Dad asleep in the armchair TV on, beer bottle beside him. 

The music brings back the teenage crushes that at the time you think will last forever only to have them dissolve a week later in a fit of agony and confusion. Feeling the pleasure in knowing that though I'm 16 I can be 18 because a scratched up piece of paper that I made on the school photo copier got me through the door to a place at the bar. The choice of beer is stupendous, where do I start, with the one I know best, the one that the old man has in the back fridge, only later do I start to try other beers. Paranoia sets in and I'm constantly glancing over my shoulder to see if any cops are coming in to bust for under age drinkers. Waiting to be brought back to the world of school books, Christian Brothers and kool kids who just don't get it.

Anyway a bit of a purge of nostalgia, though as much as I love looking back on the times and thinking of the stories I much prefer this vantage point to the one of 14 years ago. It'll be interesting to to see what I htink in another 14 years...."

"event","The hype machine has worked overtime on Magic Numbers, a UK band which the press has gushed over, all I can say is their album is underwhelming. It's not bad record but it is just not that exciting or new, bland would be the word I use. If you like your pop non-offensive and non-threatening this is the ablum for you. If you like hearing tunes and having them take you to a new place stay away at all cost. This album reminds why I don't listen to the radio. (By the way have just found out they will they will be playing the obligatory hype show at Bowery at the end of November - what a surprise Roselands say in 6 months) I predict that within six months they will be the ""hot"" new band for the upper east side crew, or is that the upper west side, or is that Tribeca or is just my imagination but is is almost every fucking neighbourhood in the borough of Manhattan below 110th st. Soon someone is going to write a song Below 110th street in answer to Bobby Womack's classic. It's going to be about too much money, gentrification, too much money, assholes, too much money, sons of bitches, too much money, tourists, too much money, billionaire mayors, too much money, East Village my ass, too much money - ok will stop venting as I do love Manhattan I just don't always like what it holds. Riding in a cab up Eighth Ave at 3:30 in the morning makes me love this city, walking on Eighth and 42nd at 3:30 in the afternoon irritates me.

Curently listening to The Go Team and they are making me happy. Imagine Cornershop but replace the Indian music samples  with 70's kidshows themes(I know that sounds stupid but that's the closest reference point) and you'll start to get the idea. Poppy dance beats that make you go ahhhhhhh the world is a good place. Also check out My Morning Jacket's new album Z - it's a step up from their last album and how can you not love an album that begins with a song titled Wordless Chorus.

Slowly working my way thru the Robert Moses biography, not always the easiest read but very interesting, the facts about the Triborough Bridge are amazing. If you ever get pissed about sitting in traffic from 100th st to the to the entry on 125th st blame Randolph Hearst, originally Moses wanted the entrance to be on 100th st saving an extra 2 mile trip for motorists but Hearst had some land he wanted to get rid of on 125th st, so Moses wanting to keep Hearst in favour due to the fact he owned 3 newspapers in the city changed the design (sounds like someone else from my country but instead of just owning newspapers he also owns network and cable TV channels). But that's why I love this city, there's so many crazy messed up stories like this one, just as there are a lot of great stories."

"event","Just watched a documentary on Ray Johnson, a artist who ran with the Warhols, Pop art crowd from the sixties onwards. He ended it all by going for a swim on Long Island in 1995. He was a contemporary of them all but according to this doco marched to his own beat, which was amazingly gifted but also frustratingly removed. He incorporated performance art, collage, photography and commercialism into his work to create an intriguing blend of art that realy defied most labels.

Apart from obviously providing a portrait of the artist this film also reminded me of how much of New York has disappeared thanks to the money hungry property developers and the rich bastards that support them. One artist talks about that when he first moved here his rent for a place on Attorney Street was $23 dollars a month so all you had to do was a make $50 a month and then go to openings and parties and you could live comfortably and create art. Are we selling ourselves completely out or has our society become that fixated on the bucks that we are losing a sense of the wonder around us, because everything does it have it price or has lost it's soul. I find myself entertained by those who lay claim to being this generations struggling artists, because at the drop of a hat they would sell it all for $100,000 grant - as would we all. 

I guess what I'm saying is that I feel the balance in New York is a little off at the moment, New York has always been a town driven by commerce on one side and passion on the other, I just think that the passion is now becoming commerce. Of course this is an idealist view for without one the other doesn't exist and this why we need to find the balance and prosper. Commerce is a necessity, passion is vital, the two make strange bedfellows but help to keep us moving and learning.

Anyway that's my little diatribe for the day - while writing this I have been attacked by my first mosquito of the year and damn the little bastard did a good job on nailing me a bunch of times, I am  now itching on my arms and belly button.

Where i'm form you have to take it out to the river, handwash it using stones and then dry them on the rock while cookoing up a meal over an open fire while fighting off the crocodiles. (Ok this last bit is what the red state people think of me and country men, believe me they are amazed when they find out we have whole cities let alone the fact that I have never seen a crocodile anywhere other than a zoo - sometimes I like to fuck with them and confirm their myths so they can spread the stupidity).

I have now figured out that there are only one group of Australians bigger than The Crocodile hunter - the Wiggles. Nearly every second apartment I go to that has toddlers have The Wiggles playing or in their video collection. not bad for a bunch of blokes that started life as high school Maths teachers and were in a band called The Cockroaches. And let's face it who can't be amused by the name Captain Feathersword. also it gives Saleman Dave a chance to give the poarents a quirky story about a friend of mine who was taight Math by the head wiggle. 

anyway killing time while the laundry cooks watching VH1 classics and they just played a Crowded House double hit which left me a little contemplative. Paul Hester, they're madcapped, larrikin drummer hung himself on the weekend. Just remind how oyu don't always know people even though yu think they do. If anyone had asked me about him I would have said he was a madcapped larrikin always out for fun and willing to have a go. Little did anyone know, apart from those close to him ,that he'd been fighting depression for years. Sad to see this disease take another victim. In Australia the biggest killer of men under 40 are themselves, a scary statistic but yet money is spent elsewhere educating the public about other problems. Now I know Paul Hester was over 40 etc but it's just the way he died remindinded me of others I went to school or were friends with - there's hardly a guy my age in Australia who doesn't know someone who has killed themselves. In most cases it is a multiple number of people, yet all that is done is nothing. Anyway sorry about the seriousness but the most selfish act in the world deserves comment and for people to try to understand the nature of the problem rather than just the result.

"event","I think I'm getting old - nostalgia for the 80's is setting in. Currently I am listening the mid 80's gem from The Cars - You Might Think I'm Crazy and all the new records I've been buying all hark back to the New wave sound. Meanwhile caught a brief glimpse on cable of ""Summer Lovers"" - a movie that back in my pre-pubescent days awoke a stirring in my loins that I would not understand for another a couple of years. the scariest thing is seeing Peter Gallagher naked- somehow I'd managed to block that from memories and was only thinking of Daryl Hannah and the French girl. Selective memory is an important tool in one's well being I've decided.

In the past week have been really excited because I was reminded why I love NYC so much- the fact that one of my all time favourite bands can play at a Tapas Bar 6 blocks from my house. Sonic Youth are playing in Astoria and when I found out I completely lost it. I'm talking about a band that I saw 4 times the first time they came to Sydney and I have now seen them another four times after that. One of my early impressions of New York was thru their music and videoes and now they are playing a small venue in my neighbourhood. That's why I love this city. Anything can happen as long as you leave yourself open to it. I see too many people day to day who close themselves off to the opportunities or chances that are out there. There is so much to see or do in this city that we become blaise about it. and coming up in a couple of months is the double bill of The Doves and Mercury Rev - two amazing bands. and then in May one of my favourite live bands of all time have reformed and are playing Irving - The Wonderstuff!!! Dave is wetting his pants and dancing in anticipation (now there's a visual you will want to block from your memory!!)

I'm as guilty as the next person as getting caught up in yr own little world and forgetting that really you're just a small stitch in the fabric of this place. We stumble around day to day with our shutters on trying to make the future more fulfilling forgetting to look up and see the things we don't know or understand that can lead us to new places and new thoughts. 

Looking at this posting it started with past and is ending with the future and I guess that's the point, everything we do is intertwined with what we were, what we are and what we are going to be that is all becomes a tangled mess of scribbles that make no sense to anyone except for us. 

Now I feel like some pompous philosophical fucker because it sounds so frigging cliched but whatever I'm going to leave it in just for the hell of it."

I could obsess about how winter is still fucking us over but it was very kool today walking around a foggy NYC and how I should remember to take my new camera out with me.

It starts to make you realize that there are so many sub-conscience thoughts, memories etc that effect our decisions and tastes. It just leaves me in awe of our brains and the capacity of them. I guess that's why I've always flirted with psychology as an interests, in particular Jung, who was obsessed with surprise surprise the un-conscience. 

Anyway what prompted this bit of navel gazing I hear you ask - a whole bunch of little things, the death of Danny Sugarman (author of No One Get Out of Here Alive - a book that led to me discover Kerouac at age 15 and form there I never looked back), a sonnet by Keats (that I had forgotten about but had a profund meaning to me back in darker adolescent days) and VH1 Classics (always good for nostalgia and transporting you back to a time when He-Man was the Master of the Universe not GW and a Transformer was not an electrical conductor).

Now the time has come for me to face the shower and the beginning of my work day, well going to delay for 15 minutes by having some day old Sesame Chicken while Bryan Adams is on VH1 - the questions is which will make me sick first?? My money is on Bryan, though I do have to say Summer of '69 is a guilty pleasure, unfortunately that is not the song playing."

I mean snow is fun, snow doesn't soak you to the bone and leave you miserable, snow brings out yr inner child and reminds that you dogs not only poop but they pee. 

That's my rant for the day, as for everything else but the weather it is all kool. Writing again which is exciting for me, have not really managed to be productive for quite some time and now I am on to a 4th draft of a short that has been in my head since 1997 and in various incarnations since that point, finally I feel like it is solid and going somewhere. Best of all my love finds it amusing and grotesque so my self doubt and insecurities have been given a break but I won't say they have been banished, though just watched a quick making of Garden State short on Sundance and now my head is spinning again."

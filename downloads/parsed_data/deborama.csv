It recurs quite infrequently (which is good!) but when it's been awhile since I have had an attack of it, I almost forget I have it, or think hopefully that it may have gone away for good.  But I had it really bad this morning, and had to stay home from work.  It's miserable and debilitating."

I have been meaning to do a little personal blogging in there amongst the commentary and ""reportage"" but every time I come to my computer meaning to do it, I end up playing solitaire or some other variety of time-wasting.  I think I am just too mentally depleted by my job.  Or something.  I have a lot of interesting little stories saved up - DH and I had a night on the tiles about a month ago and I really meant to post something about that.  And various other things.  I had a big payout on an investment of sorts and have a few thou to reinvest or spend.  That's not something I am used to.  So I did something quite uncharacteristic and bought myself a lovely toy. DH and I went out yesterday to look at printers, clothing, sofas and coffee makers.  We have two hideous, ancient, falling-apart suites, one that he had before I came here - many years before - and another almost as old that we got from his parents.  The coffee pot was because our cheap filter-drip machine died a few weeks back.  It already had an annoying crack in the plastic housing, and then someone dropped the carafe on the floor and shattered it.  So we have been discussing getting a real, serious espresso machine. The printer was something DH thought we could use - a colour laser printer.  And clothes - well, why not?   
<img src=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com/our.demesne/Deb/Suburban%20Sky.jpg"" align=right>
OK, I am not even going to try to make this story short; I'm just going to ramble.  We went to our nearest suburban-sprawl retail multiplex (Fosse Park).  We started with the furniture stores.  We found a small sofa we liked and decided to go home with the measurements, look around the lounge, mentally rearranging it, and make the decision from home.  That took a while.  Then we went to look for printers at a PC World.  We didn't plan to buy anything there, just look at printers.  While DH was looking at printers, I wandered over to the digital camera counter.  I have been thinking of taking an adult ed course in digital photography.  So the guy at the counter was showing me these cameras and he put one in my hand that I just totally fell in love with.  The thought inserted itself as I looked at it and felt it in my hand - ""object of desire"".  I am not usually subject to longings for material things, except a few specific things, like gloves, and bookplates, and really elegant pens.  This was sort of like that, a fetishy feeling, but it was all about the evident quality of the thing.  Reader, I bought it.  And I still love it the next day.  <a href=""http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dsct1-reviews.html"">This is the one.</a> The review really doesn't do it justice.  That little thing on the front that says Cybershot on it is slid upwards to cover the lens.  This turns the camera off, and sliding it back down turns it on.  The viewscreen is almost the whole back of the unit, except for a tiny little control panel.  It has a docking station for uploading your pictures or viewing your pictures or recharging the battery.  Here's a picture of our back garden, which I have named ""Suburban Sky"" (the picture, not our back garden), that I took with it. So, we also bought an espresso maker and a coffee maker.  The espresso maker is <a href=""http://uk.pricerunner.com/home-appliances/coffee-makers/100100/details"">this one</a>.  Yeah, not usually thought of as an upscale brand, but this is a serious piece of kitchen kit and surprisingly high quality.  Been trying it out - DH has been trying it out all day!  He's going to be a right mess about 2 am tomorrow.  We couldn't find any clothes I liked.  And we ordered two two-seater sofas, a chair and a footstool when we got back home.  I'm all shopped out for the moment."

"event","I got a big charge out of this article in the Guardian: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1200549,00.html"">The big fat con story,</a> an excerpt from Paul Campos's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1592400663/deborasbookre-21"">The Obesity Myth.</a>  Here's a good quote:
'The single most noxious line of argument in the literature about obesity is that black and Hispanic girls and women need to be ""sensitised"" to the ""fact"" that they have inappropriately positive feelings about their bodies. Readers may suspectthis is a bad joke: I wish it were. One University of Arizona study found that, while only 10% of the white teenage girls surveyed were happy with their bodies, 70% of the black teenage girls were happy with theirs (the black girls weighed more, on average, than the white girls).'
And another:
'In 1853, an upper-class Englishman could be quite unselfconscious about the fact that the mere sight of the urban proletariat disgusted him. In 2003, any upper-class white American liberal would be horrified to imagine that the sight of, say, a lower-class Mexican-American woman going into a Wal-Mart might somehow elicit feelings of disgust in his otherwise properly sensitised soul. But the sight of a fat woman - make that an ""obese"" - better yet a ""morbidly [sic] obese"" woman going into Wal-Mart... ah, that is something else again.'"

"event","This morning I saw a display of mass idiocy that was so stupid it was amusing.  Nottingham has this <a href=""http://www.thetram.net/"">lovely shiny new tram system</a>.  If you are unfamiliar with trams, they run on tracks embedded in the road surface, and with a few exceptions, they run alongside of traffic, and they cross traffic at the level, observing traffic lights just like buses and cars.  There is a crossing near my office of the tramline with a heavily-used one-way street.  As the tram came to the intersection, its way was blocked by a large delivery van parked in front of a pub, just inches from the track.  Therefore, no clearance at all.  The driver stopped and got out to ask the van driver to move away.  As he got out of the tram, the traffic light changed, so that he was blocking four lanes of traffic.  The trams are long and bendy, with four carriages, so it was the rear carriage blocking the road, and the driver and the van was just out of sight up the tramline.  One old geezer got really incensed at the tram so he started blowing his horn, vigorously, and - here's the stupid part - gesticulating madly at the passengers in the back of the tram and shouting ""Move"" at them.  And now here's the really stupid part - all the other drivers thought ""What a great idea!"" so they're all tooting and gesturing and shouting at the bemused passengers sitting innocently in the rear carriage of the tram.  And me standing on the corner, almost up in this old geezer's face, and laughing so hard I couldn't go anywhere till I got over my fit of hysterics.  Thanks, I needed that."

"event","I have a bit of a thing about the moon. When the weather is fine, I like to meditate on the moon.  (Well, not <i>on</i> the moon, but you know what I mean.)  The past couple of nights there has been a lovely moon-venus conjunction.  In our part of the world, it was exceedingly beautiful Monday night.  I saw it as I got off the train, on the way to my yoga class and just after it (about 9 pm.)  The moon was a waxing crescent, and slightly pale orange, and Venus was about three moon diameters away, above and to the right, and looked very blue and twinkly.  It reminded me of these lyrics from Terrapin Station:
     ""The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
     ""From the northwest corner of a brand-new crescent moon
     ""Crickets and cicadas sing a rare and different tune""
Except no crickets and cicadas; too cold."

"event","Back to the UUUK that is.  I had an interesting and fun visit - no political arguments and surprisingly little contention of any kind.  Both adult children are doing pretty well (not that they couldn't both use some money if you're offering!)  And my parents are still going strong despite such calamities as having a broken neck and two rounds of surgery or being bitten by a dog while out walking.  I went shopping with my two younger sisters at an outlet mall in Gulfport, something we realised we had never done together (that's go shopping full stop, not just at this particular place.)
I am very out of touch with things.  They do have newspapers of a sort in Gulfport and the family is on the internet through AOL (which is a bugger to use when you're not used to it.)  But I only caught the high points.  My dad is a fan of Faux News and my Mum doesn't watch news unless something that is important to her has happened.  'Nuff said.  (But I love 'em anyway and I am not just saying that in case they read my blog, either.)
So maybe a real post with content and links and all that will come out tomorrow.  I need to readjust my sleep cycle now."

"event","This is just a note to let folks know I am still around.  But around Gulfport Mississippi at the moment.  
My Mum got a new computer from my youngest brother for Christmas so this is what I am blogging on.  I am going to crash (me not the computer) pretty soon.  I got back to my Aged Ps' house from the party, which is why we are all here - it was my middle sister Cindy's 25th wedding anniversary.  There were at least 50 people there.  There were a lot of nostalgic tears.  And no political arguments; in fact no arguments of any kind.  Amazing.   
I am spending some good time with my grand-daughter.  There were two little babies, almost exactly the same age, at this party.  Shep, Cindy's husband, is 19 years older than she is, and his grand-daughter from a previous marriage had a baby girl the day after Savannah was born.  So my younger sister has a step-great-granddaughter one day younger than my only grand-daughter.  Kind of like that old ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" song.  But what's really cute is this baby is named Aspen.  So we have two babies at a family get-together not really related to each other, and both named after popular American holiday destinations.  
I got a cool new picture of my son Carey, which will be up on the Personal Page after I get home.  
We had a lot of good food, provided by my other sister Denise and my youngest brother Scott, who is attending chef school (his second career, after being a radio programme manager for many years.)"

We actually had our main meal yesterday.  I wanted to take it easy today because tomorrow I go on the long grueling journey to a family celebration.  This involves a few hours on the road to Gatwick, a few hours at Gatwick, about 9 hours flying, a few hours in Detroit and then flying to Memphis, a couple of hours in Memphis then a (hopefully) quick hop to Gulfport, where it will be at least 11 pm the same day but will feel like 5 am the next day to me.  Ugh.
So, what we had (and still have).  A very large, fat free-range-reared goose, simply roasted.  Damson cheese, which I made back in early September. (I used Mrs. Beeton's recipe but <a href=""http://www.hwatson.force9.co.uk/cookbook/recipes/preserve/damsoncheese.htm"">this</a> is pretty close.)  Mashed cauliflower and celeriac with cream, and also, parboiled cauliflower and celeriac roasted in goose fat.  Stir-fried thinly sliced brussels sprouts with shallots, chili and mushrooms.  Wild rice with onion and celery.  Chilled Cava Brut to drink."

"event","We are having a goose this year and we are having our Christmas lunch today, and snacking on the leftovers tomorrow.  And there will be a lot of leftovers; it says a 10-lb. goose will feed 8 and there are only the two of us and we ordered a 10-lb. goose but the darn thing would not quit eating and turned out to be a 16-lb. goose.  Fortunately, it was mostly fat, which we have trimmed off a bit (there is a large mixing bowl full of un-rendered fat) and at least as much if not more will come off as it roasts.  Goose fat keeps about 6 months in the fridge and is good for lots of uses, including feeding to the birds and frying things in (not me, though, I find the idea slightly repellent, but hubby does not have that problem, oh, no.)  Also, he is planning to take some leftovers down to Kingsclere when he visits his aged Ps after dropping me at Gatwick for my trip to Mississippi.
All of which is a very long introduction to say that for the first time in six years we are not having <a href=""http://deboramaskitchen.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_deboramaskitchen_archive.html#107226275867414891"">Christmas Salmon,</a> a recipe of my own devising and quite outrageously good, for Christmas.

I saw the osteopath on Saturday and I went to yoga last night and I am getting better, really, but I still have a lot of back pain, and it's a long, cramped ride to and from work, and a lot of standing around on hard train platforms in the cold, and I don't have much (anything?) to do at work, so I decided I could really use another day of rest.  As is usually the case when I stay home and hubby is out, I got tons of cleaning and tidying done, things that always bother the hell out of me but I can never seem to do when he is here.  I also went shopping at George, the ""dry goods"" section of Asda (read: British Walmart) and I bought a few gifties for my grand-daughter.  
It looks like both adult children of me have got their tickets to Mississippi, so we are all going to be there at roughly the same time.  The oldest adult child has her own baby, the aforementioned grand-daughter, who will be almost 4 months old.  It will be the first time the rest of the family have seen her.  I hope it will be a good visit.  There are a lot of emotional pits we could fall into, but maybe we will all behave ourselves.  I know I will try, and the worst offenders (always the parents, don't you think?) have been considerably mellowed by age and adversity (present company included.)

"event","I can't believe it!  I was hit by a car this evening just as I left work.  The lady who hit me was very shaken herself (as who wouldn't be) and we swapped details and 2 young women who witnessed it gave me theirs too.  But I did not want to report it (although I may later, just in the interest of publlic safety statistics) and I did not want to go to A&E in Nottinghmam, where it happened (because if I had I am sure I would still be there and be feeling much worse than I am now).  

Here's what happened : the woman who hit me said she would drive me anywhere (no trivial offer, if you could have seen the state of the traffic) and I said the train station.  Fortunately I was able to get 1) ice for my knee from the coffee kiosk, 2) a direct train home, more or less on time, and 3) a seat on the very crowded train and even near the door which made it much less painful getting off.  I was able to drive the short distance home, and by then I had no doubt that I was in shock (I still am, but getting better).  I had sweet decaf tea and a little brandy and a hot bath and about an hour later, a light supper.  Now I am almost OK - a little drunk, tummy upset, vague beat-up achey feeling, and a very bruised right knee, which took the brunt of it.   I sort of bounced off the front of the car (fortunately she was pulling cautiously into the road and just looking the other way, so the speed was quite low) and flew in a low gentle arc to the ground, landing on one knee and two hands.

I suppose I will go and get checked out tomorrow; I ought to have my knee x-rayed and at my age and with my family history, I worry about blood clots a bit.  But other than that, I am surprisingly OK.  <self-pity>Still, I could use a hug.</self-pity>"

"event","Another work day; I got a late start and then the train was late, so I was at least 1/2 hour late to work.  Fortunately, they don't give me any grief about that, but still I would rather not be late ever.  I am doing exactly nothing at work these days (the reason why is a long story and partly confidential, but suffice it to say it is nobody's fault, there is nothing I can do about it, and no one knows when it will end.)
I usually have a really wonderful yoga class (called Dru Yoga - has anyone ever heard of that before?  I hadn't) It is taught by a perky young woman named Mitch, and held in a Spiritualist church.  Mitch is taking a one-day holiday today, so no class.  She teaches another yoga class tomorrow night at a community centre, and I am going to try to go to that instead.  I need my exercise!  I really need more, but I have a hard time doing anything on my own.  I could use an exercise partner - hint, hint."

"event","I am mostly blogging.  (On my other, high-maintenance blogs, more than here.)  But Blogger seems to be on the fritz just now.  I am about to miss the opportunity to go to the supermarket and replenish the decaf.  I think I am feeling ambivalent about decaf.  Oh, I am also doing laundry.  
I always know when DH is teetering on the edge of depression.  (His episodes these days are so brief and mild compared to what they were that they are more like moods than depression.)  The clue is when he starts answering all manner of questions with the monosyllable ""Pass"", which I have figured out is British for ""I don't want to talk to you just now."""

"event","OK, I had what I said for tea last night, so that's good.  But then I had a bit more - a small omelette (2 eggs, 1/2 oz. cheese)

BTW, eggs I fix at home will always be free-range, as that's all we buy.  We buy them from the greengrocer.  Cheese will almost always be vegetarian mature cheddar, unless otherwise stated.  Personally, I would buy organic cheese and just eat less of it, but DH won't agree to that.  

We have a vegetable garden and so depending on the season, the following things will be home-grown and almost organic (no pesticides, organic fertilizers wherever possible; we compost vigorously): rocket (arugula); mixed lettuce, chard, beetroot (not eating currently due to Atkins (sigh)), radish, fennel (we grew these but had bad yields), chillis, tomatoes, almost all herbs, esp. parsley and coriander (cilantro), courgettes (zucchini) and other squashes), string beans (again - very low yield this year), sorrell (only from garden), raddichio.  Oddly enough the only things we are currently eating from the garden are chillis (now kind of dried) and tomatoes (hung branches of green ones in the utility room at first frost - this works very well and they are sweet and tasty when they ripen!) and rocket, which just goes on and on and is completely frost-resistant.

This morning, I discovered that DH had just had the last of my decaf Italian coffee.  This after months of moaning that he would never follow my lead and convert to decaf, Atkins or not, because he didn't see the point of decaf.  When he converted, it was sudden and total (he's like that) and he left behind a 1/2 lb. bag of strength 5 coffee.  I made a pot of that, poured half a cup, added lots of cream and topped up the cup with boiling water.  But I'll still be up all night, just watch . . . 
So far I have had that and two fried eggs and two veggie sausages.  This was a new kind of sausage for me (Cauldron cumberland).  Liked the texture; the taste is too salt-and-pepper for me though.  (I shudder to see the TV chefs pour salt and pepper into otherwise appealing recipes.  They are such brutal tastes!  I am very sparing with salt and never use black pepper, preferring white pepper and/or cayenne.)"

"event","OK, this is a big leap of faith for me.  First, I have tried and failed many times to do a diet journal.  Second, I am not a fan of public confessions, especially for the fat.  But what the hell.

My current weight is about 209 lbs.  I am about 5'7"" and I am 51 years old.  When I started dieting, many, many months ago, I weighed about 225 lbs.  (NB: In England where I live , weight is expressed in stones (14lbs.) and lbs. so I started off at 16 st 1 lb and now weigh 14 st 13 lbs by English reckoning.)  My goal weight is quite modest - my initial goal is to get below 200 lbs, (14 st 4 lbs) then to get below 13 st (so will reach that when I weight 181 lbs.)  Then my ultimate goal is 160 lbs or 11 st 6 lbs.  Why so much?  Well I have a picture of myself at 160 lbs. size 16 American, (18 UK) and granted I was only 25, but frankly I looked fabulous.  So screw BMIs and height-weight tables; I know where I want to be.

I am now doing my second attempt to get through a 2-week Atkins induction.  As a former vegetarian, I find this very challenging, and the main problem for me is not boredom, bad breath or constipation (well, that's a problem, but I can take stuff for that) but the fact that eating no fruit and very little veg makes me feel extremely ill.  But I think I'll do better this time, because in the intervening months since I tried it last time I have altered my diet and got used to eating chicken and fish in large quantities, which I was not used to then.  So we'll see.

Today's food:
3 free-range eggs, fried in butter
2 Quorn (tm) sausages
1 piece Camembert
1 decaf latte
small bowl of pistachios
cup of decaff tea with cream
large green salad, w/olive oil and garlic*
2 trout fillets fried in butter with lemon juice* 
a little steamed cauliflower*
Those last items are starred because I haven't had dinner yet; that is what's planned."

"event","Today - it being Saturday - I went into Birmingham on the train to check out the new supposedly super-deluxe, drop-dead trendy ""shopping experience"" which is the re-modeled BullRing.  I also wanted to check out the Birmingham City Markets which I have never seen, and the German Christmas market, which I did see, very briefly, about 4 or 5 years ago.  Generally, I am still glad I went and satisfied my curiosity and some moments were enjoyable, but on the whole, I was not impressed.  The German Market is good and recommended; that said, I didn't buy anything.  I could have.  I have a hard time buying anything in England.  This has been going on for a few years.  Except for tights and underwear and the occasional thing I need.  Going shopping is now mostly a spectator sport.  This strange retail monstrosity I went into - I think it was Selfridge's, but who knows? - was a real turn-off.  I suppose it was drop-dead trendy and it really did make me wish I could drop dead, if only to shock the zombies a little.  Oh, the B'ham city markets are not worth the trip, even if its a short one.  I did discover a very genial old Victorian three-storey Waterstone's with a cosy Costa Coffee (say that three times fast), but all I bought was a coffee.  If you visit my ""online bookstore"" you may find out why I, the world's most addicted bibliophile, almost never buy books in England anymore either.  That's at http://deboramasbooks.blogspot.com/."

""oh, my roommate klye, you mean? I think he's on the phone with his girlfriend.""  and so I beat the platonic horse to death in two sentences.  black haired boy asks my name.  I tell him, Sara.  He says, ""are you jewish?"" and I say ""no, but I guess I am delighted that I pass.""  He laughs and says ""I pass too, and my name is Nathan.""  and thus began this weekend's installment of The Boy Who Asks for a Girl's Number then Never Calls."

"event","I guess I'll go back to jotting things down in here since I will be returning to the place from which most of these entries came.  I just had dinner with a befuddling character from the county.  We went to Brown's Chinese American restaraunt in Luray, VA. I tend to have two starkly differing experiences with this fellow.  Sometimes, usually when there are other people around, we argue and it is baseless, furious, absurd arguing over topics that range from the depth of Wal-Mart to domesticated housepets.  Then, on other occassions we are ridiculously civil.  We act as though we are in an old russian novel.  He delivers a monologue of sorts and I insist on piping in from time to time to question his musings.  He's rather my arch nemesis, but FFS, I can't leave it alone.  Admittedly, agreeability is the quality most likely to repel me. it's like I have no other option than to be eternally tormented by choice.  attracted most by someone oft considered my arch-nemesis.  curse it all."

"event","after four months of sharing a room with dear sweet innocent aryan hannah, it has surfaced at her departure that I have been swearing in my sleep this entire time.  Oh, the praying she must have done for my soul.  That's why she read the bible before bed- to fend of the devil's words!  

I am perplexed though because people keep asking me what sort of repressed rage must I have to be swearing in my sleep.  I feel as though I readily embrace most of the rage that I have and express it fairly vocally.  I've never been one shy to swear.  So I can hardly fathom what sort of festering source of rage I might harbor that could be producing these nocturnal outbursts.

"event","I think we had all given up hope that it might rain anytime soon.  We had already accepted the probability that the river that feeds our irrigation pump would run dry and that we would just have to watch the field slowly dry naturally.  Even with our drip irrigation, things are struggling.  We have a lot of really sad brown crops out there.  Drip irrigation consists of a network of drip tape that runs underneath the plastic that is spread over the rows that we plant.  There are small slits in the paint out of which water leaks quite slowly.  It takes about three days for the system to water the whole 8 acres of farm.  Yesterday and today seem to be rainy today and we are tentatively relieved.  It is a challenge to grow a vegetable like a cucumber that is 90% water when there is no water. 

Hooray for water but this means that sports night might be off tonight.  All the better I suppose.  This week, my time seems to be intensely structured.  Yesterday there was scrabble at lunchtime, dinner with interns, pickling, then read aloud time (the nation did a food issue with all of our favorite sustainablity superstars.) Tonight is sports night, wednesday is farm dinner (goodbye dinner for hannah,) thursday we are going to pennsylvania on a field trip to a creamery, then friday is oru friend lea's goodbye party.  At some point, it might be nice to have a minute to write a letter or something.  However, with so many people leaving town soon, I guess I should just embrace the social spirit while I can."

First, I went with a friend to the Shakespeare Theatre for a production of The Persians.  Then, I met up with another friend for Taint, the gay indie dance party at DC9.

And that bed, procured from craigslist for $75 is the best night's sleep I have ever had.  Others agree.  The upside of this loss is that I was forced to do some real packing/organizing last night in order to get things cleared out for the person who would be hauling this away.  Within one frantic hour after work yesterday, I got more packing done than I did all weekend.  Not bad.  I may just pull this off.  Not that I am sleeping on the crippling old futon in the guest room, I am inclined to wake earlier than usual which is problematic because I am sure as hell not going into work early (meaning on time) at 8:30.

It's just that it was a beautiful day, and I had planned on it for a while, then a dear friend flew in from out of town so all signs pointed to delinquency.  Drove to BWI to pick up the friend, enjoying the drive unfettered by traffic, sun shining all the way.  Now, I shall see if I can make any headway in the great packing fiasco.  Finally bought packing tape despite my plan to just steal it from work (yes, that seems a little wrong, but they owe me) so I'd like to get some boxes ready to ship tomorrow.  

I was lying in bed on Sunday evening, getting ready to sleep and was struck with might be described as sadness that my room would no longer be my room, and that, within a week, I will no longer be sleeping in my bed.  It has been a long time since I've become so attached to a space.  For a long time, even in college, spaces I was in were always very temporary in my mind.  I always arrived knowing when I was leaving.  Even in Seattle where I was trying to put down roots, the situation was always tenuous enough with housing and work that leaving seemed inevitable.  This was different, DC was semi-permanent, I have a great place to live, more friends than I have ever had, and a job that pays decently. I was going to make a real go of it.  And I did, but ended it spontaneously, maybe with three months notice, but still in a manner that I could hardly fathom when I came to DC.  It is not bad, just a situation that I have yet not experienced.   So again, I will detach myself from a space, to learn a new one, in a different manner though, because I know I will be leaving the farm in November.  It will be like going to summer camp, but with ten hours of back breaking labor each day.  So more like a gulag I guess. But in a good way.  In a good way."

And, after covering all of the possibilities- workplaces, schools, neighborhoods, and ruling those out,  we realized that we vaguely recognized eachother from my neighborhood bar.   Why do I even bother leaving? 

I took the day off of work to wait around for the comcast guy in teh morning and moreso, to use one of five sick days I have to use within the next two weeks.   I should at some point catch up on my sleep but I will also need a culinary project for the day and I think I have settled on the idea of making english muffins.  I recently discovered how they are made, cooked on a griddle rather than baked, and am consequently fascinated.  I feel like if I can manage a decent muffin, it would be criminal not to have some good jam around.  I suppose honey or butter would do, but I'd love some strawberry jam.  

I am feeling slightly remiss about not making it up to Boston this weekend to help a friend pick out  a wedding dress for her july wedding.

Yeah, I might be the worst bridesmaid ever.   But, as a same sex wedding, this is an intriguing challenge.   We are not sure what approach to take to such things as bridal showers and bachelorette parties,  once again, not traditions in which I would partake for myself, but I am a good sport so I will do my best to do it up right."

I have not been able to find any recipes for exclusively beet confections, they always pair the beet with chocolate so I assumed that people msut have tried it without chocolate and that maybe it just didn't bake well or tasted bad.

I am unbearably excited about my plan to give notice at work tomorrow but the tenuous state of my recovery is detracting from this pleasure.  I don't want to quit my job just to find out that I really do have mono or something nasty and expensive.  

I suspect that the recent summery type weather has stirred up some nostalgic anxiety about the whole situation that ensued last summer.  If I were to be here again, it would be a whole different experience, but still, probably chock full o' boredom induced frivolity as have been the past 6 months of my life.  Don't misconstrue my message, it has been a delightful experiment in socialization, but I need to cultivate something a little more substantive for myself.  

Am I the only one who thinks that the message written on a donation card reading ""May God bless you with both hands"" sounds really really dirty?"

"event","for the past 15 mintues, I have had to listen to three people gathered at the cubicle next to mine discuss the intricacies of this year's American Idol season.  but no matter, because I am in fairly good spirits despite a severe shortage of sleep for the second night in a row.  It is friday and the weather is amazing and I have a lunchtime fieldtrip planned with my Membership crew.  They are the best because ridiculous and obscene conversations ensue whenever we gather.  

My coworker whose desk is always clean and clear and very well ordered stopped by my cube yesterday and was horrified at the state of affairs.  He was visibly disturbed that I could work like this (and well, I can't but I am too busy to organize and happen to be hampered by some organizational idiosynchracies anyhow.) I am pretty sure he spent the rest of the afternoon repressing the images of my chaotic workspace.  While he was in my cube, he pointed at a pile of papers strewn about the floor in horror and I balked, saying that they were there for a reason and had been for weeks so it was fine.  Later that day however, I was inspired to order my cube and finally picked up the papers to file them away and discovered that a number of tiny beige spiders had made their home in the stack of papers.  So the lesson kids is, the reason that people do not store papers on teh floor but rather in filing cabinets is that spiders will most surely infiltrate. Blast it all."

First there was Belle and Sebastian with New Pornographers for which tickets were nearly impossible to procure.  Then I missed Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah, kind of my fault though because I've somehow decided that I don't like 9:30 Club so I don't check their schedule much.  For the same reason, I also missed Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Blast it all. I should have made it a point ot get one last good show in before I go to the farm.  The biggest tragedy in my pop music existence is that I will miss Wolf Parad at the Black Cat and I love both.  Nuts to that I say.  Yeah, so life could be rougher I guess."

Attendance was low, my little sub-group carried the party in full attendance and full willingness to consume more than one drink.  Confirmed- happy hour at the Holocaust Museum is inherently challenging.  This is a point I don't really understand either, because for me, being at work just makes beer and smokey bars all the more appealing. I think with some practice though, we could really enhance the quality of happy hour outings at the Museum."

I have done very little cutting with the blades but have opened countless wine bottles with the corkscrew while backpacking about, cut my hair a few times, and have never had to buy a real screwdriver.  if only there were a phillips head on there, it'd be the supreme tool.  

rolled into work a little late this morning because I went out to the gay country western bar on capitol hill.  it was very fun, but there was no two stepping like at the little red hen in seattle.  maybe on a weekend?  

woke up in the middle of the night, anxiety-ridden, in the middle of a dream about bumping into the ex-roommate on the street.  yikes.  this is a small city, but I think I may be able to avoid casually bumping into Crazy by virtue of the fact that he doesn't go anywhere fun.  whew.

The chicken was tasty, moist and crispy but I had quite a difficult time getting the meat off.  And, does anybody know- Am I supposed to hack the neck off the chicken before I cook it?  Is that even possible or necessary?  In addition to the chicken, I combined parsnips and potatos with thyme for a spunkier mashed potato. The only mild culinary failure of the night was my foray into biscuit making. For the first time ever, I tried to make buttermilk biscuits.  They didn't rise a bit, but they were pretty flakey and tasty anyhow so it wasn't a complete failure.  I do so love to cook for people.  Maybe I should just become a school lunch lady.  

I spent the morning filling out government travel reimbursement forms for other people in the department.  fucking federal forms are so convoluted.  but it is ok, because I have another, equally enthralling and fulfilling activity- I have a stack of 1,200 copies of acknowledgement letters that I mailed that I need to alphabetize in order to store them away for the auditors.  This has resulted in the odd scene of me crouching on the floor of my cubicle with 24 stacks of paper spread about me.  It is a luxuriously large cubicle.  Maybe it is mind numbing and tedious, but at least I can listen to music whilst I toil."

Sure, I am slightly disconcerted by this unrelenting physical ailment, but I've got a month to get that sorted out before I re-enter the realm of the medically uninsured.  scary I know, but I am hoping that the wholesome nature of the work will provide me with a physical robustness more beneficial than the panoply of modern medical technology afforded by health insurance.  yup, no holes in that theory.  none.

"event","And when I say 'advise' I mean please reaffirm my choice on this most recent sticky wicket I've encountered.  Out of the blue, a personnel consultant with whom I had worked earlier last year called me to talk about a development assistant position he thought i would be perfect for.  It sounds like I could get about 25% more pay and good federal benefits and work in an office with windows, but I'd still be a general assistant to a nascent department. There is much risk of ambiguous role and responsibility overload with that type of deal. Before they will offer me the job though, the consultant is insisting to know whether I will take it.  Fuck that, I say.  

So if I turn this down, I will go to the farm which I have built up in my illusions to be a idyllic land of satisfying vocation and wholesome interactions.  Question is, in nine months, am I going to end up destitute with no job, no health insurance and some sort of massive illness like cancer, ruing the day that I turned down this job?  or, even worse, am i going to be stuck on a farm in rural virginia with five insufferably boring or annoying people?  this could be great though, the potential is greater than the best case scenario in taking this other job, that I would be financially stable and in a mildly better environment, maybe complacent for a bit.  who needs stability anyhow?"

First, my body is a mess, I've got this hideous bronchial infection that won't go away, they are testing me for mono, and I haven't been able to exercise in over two weeks.  Next (and this is where it gets frivolous) all of my material posessions are malfunctioning.  First my computer died (soon to be fixed by my brother) depriving me of access to most of my music. Next, my car gets broken into and, on my way home from getting the window replaced, I rear-end somebody, causing further damage to my car (I only have liability insurance so that won't be getting fixed.)  Then, yesterday I pulled out my ipod, too weak and tired to read or knit on the metro, only to find that the blasted thing is broken.  The hold button no longer sticks and there are odd scratches on it, I have no idea what happened but now it is skipping?! ipods don't skip?! bloody fucking hell.  

I know, I know, I should probably just interpret this as a warning against relyin on such superficial comforts.  and yeah, sure, maybe it just illuminates how hollow and meaningless my life is that this is all I have to worry about, but nonetheless, I am tormented, do not belittle my torment.

Then people came back for a wholesome game of Jenga and orange slices so it was a very fun but mild evening.  I really should have just gone to bed at like 10pm though because I think my ailment has revived itself, having outlasted the course of antibiotics.

Perhaps I could have treated my body better over the course of this illness, maybe been a bit more abstemious with the devil's water and turned down a few of those cigarettes.  But the voices of reason that used to fetter my mind are silent, squelched by large amounts of alcohol, loud music, and severe professional boredom.

It gets better though- on my way back from getting the window glass in my car replaced, I got into a car accident.  No wait- more accurately stated, I caused an incredibly stupid and entirely avoidable accident.  I was a little bit lost on Mass. ave and was looking to see if a side street would take me to Rock Creek Park when I slammed right into the car ahead of me.  fine fine, his car was slightly (but most likel expensively) damaged and mine looks like hell and still drives fine, but I don't have collision insurance, so his car will be ship shap in no time where mine will most likely be sporting duct tape buttresses on the front bumper for the rest of its limited working existance. I am a menace on the roads, the worst motorist ever.  Would it be so bad to limit my mobility to the realm o fthe bicycle?  I think it is the best option for all involved."

Because, instead of really making a concerted effort to be less frivolous, I am just leaving.  I could stay here and stop going to the wonderland so much, actually go on real dates with people, and start volunteering somewhere or something, or take classes.  But nooooo, I am just going to go live on a farm where I will be forced to be wholesome.  This could be very very good, or very very bad.  Either way though, when I think of leaving my job, my soul sings with joy.  that's right- joy in my soul festering, about to burst, ooze out of little cracks all over because I cannot contain my relief and excitement to leave this job, this office, this paperwork, these coworkers.

I also don't feel so bad that, in my sloppy state, I told my boss that I was insufferably bored at work and my tolerance for the situation is fast waning.  She seemed pretty receptive to that, and because she only gets to claim about 25 percent of my time at work (she's one of many supervisors) its not her fault and her hands are tied.

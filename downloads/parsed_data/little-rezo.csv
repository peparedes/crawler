I have not done much to be honnest, been to work as per usual, but may not be working for the Charity much longer, because the lack of money the charity is recieving to pay wages. So I dunno what im gonna do if I end up quitting the job.

I got some new on my passport too, I had a letter through the post asking if I have had a passport in the past, I just hope it does not take them long to sent me the passport, because its been bugging me lately, I just want my passport so I can go see Danae.

I also got my own IRC Server this week w00t! Its all going good so far, Gary (lostmonk) has been making the site to go with the server and all is looking good! Just gotta pray and God will bring people to the Server.

Hmm, I think thats it. Oh! Also I am going camping next Wednesday, im taking Ben and his friends for his birthday, it should be an awesome time, full of laughter! :P

"event","Woops! I have not updated my Journal for over a week now. Nothing much has happened during the last week, appart from working. I did phone Danae and Jon though! That was the highlight of the week. I spoke to Danae for over 40 minutes about random stuff, it was pretty cool to speak to her again, I was not so shy this time, I think I spoke more! lol. I also spoke to Jon, it was good to speak to him again, we talked about Server stuff then he had to go to the mall to get his mom a Mothers Day gift.
I also have been updating Christian-RPG a lot this week, things are looking up for the site now, we are gaining a lot more hits and quite a few people have been joining the forums! w00t! Lets hope it keeps growing. :D Oh, I also helped Katie (my friend) with a colour scheme for her Journal, im glad she is happy with it. Thats all I can think of to type for today.

"event","My Weekend Away

Well, I have not updated my Journal for three days now, because I have been away to a Dwarf Sports and Social Event in Birmingham.

Day 1
Day one I had to take the day off work so I could get ready to go to Birmingham. It takes about 2 and a half hours in the car, my Dad 
drove so I sat in the back seat with my brother. Once we got to the Hotel, it was quite big and VERY posh inside. We took our bags to our rooms, I was sharing a room with my brother. We did not do much during the night time, we just hung around the Hotel with all the other dwarfs, talking about random things, and I met some new people. At about 12:00am we went to bed.

Day 2
We had to get up early for the Athletics today! My brother was taking part in the Running, Javelin and Discus. He did quite well, he got some meddals. I just sat in the stadium for most of the morning listening to music on my mp3 player. Then I decided to wonder around the stadium and watch my brother take part in Discus and Javelin. Just before the Athletics had finished, I saw Jo! Jo had just arrived on the Saturday night (I met Jo online) I have never seen such a nice looking dwarf in my life. My brother wanted me to go over and talk to her, but I was too shy to even say hello to her. Once we got back to the hotel after the Athletics had finished, I sat on my own in the bar watching football, and I could see Jo 3 tables away, but she did not see me, I was still too shy to talk to her. Eventualy she had spotted me, then she came over and talked to me with her friends, for a few hours I spent time talking to her and her friends outside, it was cool fun.

At 9:00pm, Jo asked me if I wanted to go Clubing with her and her friends. I said to her that I didnt realy want to go Clubing, but she kept asking me to go with her and I refused each time she asked. So, they all went out around 10:15pm Clubing, and I stayed in the Hotel alone, I just sat down in the lobby watching the younger dwarfs play games, running after one another. At 1:30am, I decided to not wait for them to get back, because they could of been gone for a lot longer, so I went to my room and slept.

Day 3
In the morning, I got up all happy, had a bath and cleaned my teeth, etc. Then went downstairs to the lobby and hung around talking to random dwarfs about different things, and waiting for Jo to come from her room, but she did not come down. About 9:00am it was time to go to a Sports Hall for the Basketball competition, my brother was taking part, he did well, almost got a few balls in the net, but they kept bouncing back out. I was now waiting for Jo to come to the Sports Hall, but, when she did come in, she was not alone, it seems that one of the boys who went clubing with the crew asked her out in the club, they was kissing right infront of me, and giggling with eachother, I just got up and went to talk to someone else. Once the Basketball had finished I went back to the Hotel.
Tonight was Disco night, everyone went to the disco and it was quite good to start off with, untill I went to sit with the guys, they were all drinking beer and stuff. So one of the lads asked if I wanted a drink from the bar, and I told him to get me a double Jack Daniels, it was kind of nice for him to pay for the drink. By the end of the night I had drunk 4 glasses of double Jack Daniels and Coke, and I was totaly drunk, and so was everyone else. My brother had to guide me to our room which he said took about an hour to get me there. Once I had gotten to my room I started being sick in the toilet and I was feeling quite unwell by now.

Day 4
Well, I woke up and I fealt like poo, I was still feeling sick and today was coming home day, so I just did not know what to do. Here is when I started thinking about things. I started getting upset about what I had done the night before, and I could not believe what I had done, so I prayed hard to God, to say im very sorry for what I had done that night, and that it would never happen again. I had my friends on my mind too, Danae and Jon, I dont think they will be happy with what I have done, and I feel so bad, because I love them 
as good friends in Christ and this may hurt them. I dont know why I toutched the alchohol, because I never usualy drink, I just fealt as if, I was left out, because everyone else is drinking, and I wasnt. It was so dumb of me, and I should know better, it was like the devil was saying messages in my head like... ""C'mon you are looking dumb not drinking with them, have a drink!"" and he got the better of me. Then we came home, after a bad ending.

I just want to say to all my friends who have read this. I wanted to be honnest with you all on what I did, and I promise this wont happen again, please pray for me. Thanks."

When I got to work, only two of us where in the office, other people took days off, but im saving my days of for next month, when I go see Danae and Jon. I spent sometime on the work's website in the office, then started talking to Elaine, the other employer in the office, and we had Chocolate Muffins with cream in them! w00t!

I came home and gave my bro his Birthday Card, I gave him some cash to spend. Then I had food, fish, chips and peas! It was all yummeh. I came online for a bit after eating, updated Christian RPG's News. Then it was time to go pick up my bro and his friends from the local Pizza Hutt. I took Ben and Peter home, we had a laugh in the car talking about random things. Once I got back home I came online, spoke to Jon about his Forums and stuff. Then I spoke to Danae, and started looking around for Silicone Bracelets again! All the silly shops only sell the bracelets in packs of 50, 100, 500, me and Danae dont need that many. lol. So we are going to stick with letting Becky make us some Friendship bands."

"event","Today I got up quite late, because I was late going to bed. Once I got up I ate a full Sunday Meal with my parents and brother, just like every Sundays. Then I messed around on the computer a little with website stuff. Had to take James to the local Sports Shop in my car, because he wanted to buy something he had seen there. We came home, and played Soccer in the back garden for a bit, untill James smashed the bin! :P Then I came inside and went online for a bit.

By the time I had done online it was time to go to Church! Church was fun, I stood up at the back for the whole first half of the service, then we headed to the new Church building with the Youth. In this building we did Life Issues, it was quite interesting, I sat with Ben all the time. Then once we had done with Life Issues, the Youth Pastor called me over and asked me ""WHY did you finish with Amy, Phil?"" and I said ""Well, it was gonna be hard because she could not come for another year to see me"" so he replied and said he wanted to talk to me sometime on my own.

After all that stuff, we headed to Becky's house, me and Ben just messed around outside talking about random stuff, and he wanted to sit in my car drivers seat, so I let him. I turned on the car, with him in the drivers seat, and told him to put his foot on the exelerator, and he had a fright, because the car went... ""vrrrrrrooom"" haha, good job the hand brake was on. :D Once we spent about 2 hours at Becky's, me and my bro came home, and I came online.

When I came online I spoke to Danae, and im going to get her a Black, Pink and Purple friendship band made for her this week, then I will post it over to her place. She has become my best friend now.

Peace!"

"event","w00t! Today I spoke to Danae and Jon on the phone for the first time. It was so cool talking to them, I did not say much to start with, because I was a little shy, so Danae talked the most. :P We talked about all different kinds of stuff, such as her Snakes, myself, Steph, and about me going there once I get my passport. I was kind of supprised that Steph said she was going to move in when im over, so we can all have a laugh together! With Jon, I talked about computer stuff, and how messy he is with his DVD's all over the floor, haha. Its gonna be so much fun at Danae's and Jon's house! :D

Tomorrow is Sunday, we are starting something new in our Church Youth. Its called 'Life Issues', we are going to be talking about different things such as drugs and lust... ect. The Youth Pastor wanted me to do a small testimony on wearing a 'mask' over your face, pretending to be someone your not, but I told him I did not want to do it, because I dont think I have ever tried to be someone im not. Im looking forward to hearing the other Youth's views though, because I know some of them are a little lustfull at times.

"event","This week has been a hard one. Amy and I have decided to stop dating. It was getting hard for us both, she was planning to come here to visit me, but we found out it would never happen this year because she is busy with School and trying to get into University. Waiting to see Amy for a whole year would of been quite difficult and hard for the both of us, and we both understand that. Amy was a very nice girl and was very kind, and made me happy, she has also made me a better man in many ways, and I love her for that. We will be good friends and I will be phoning her every now and then to see how she is, and how life is treating her.

I am going to be going to Danae and Jon's house in a few months time, I have to get my Passport form sorted out first, then I can order the tickets. I am looking forward to going, its going to be such good fun with them. Both Danae and Jon have helped me a lot with things lately and I thank God that I met such awesome people!

Danae said she is going to be cooking some Mexican food when I go over to their house, I have never tried Mexican food before, so I hope its nice and yummy! :P

It took time for her parents to say 'yes' but after speeking to her Mom on the Phone she was happy with Amy coming over. Her Dad needed to Phone the Police Station to make sure I live at the address I gave her, but he could not get an answer, silly ignorant Police people! tsk! Anyway, Amy mannaged to find a website that shows addresses and names of the people who live there, if she had not found that website, it would of been another story, thank God she came accross it! We are both much happyer now it has been finalised. But I cant order the tickets untill Amy hears more from School and University.

Im so happy for us both, and I cant wait to be with her!

I went to work as per ususal! Did what I had to do with work then came home, lazed around the house for a bit, and came online. When I came online I got a good contact from a Popular Gaming Website! We are now affiliated so it should help my new Christian Gaming site become more popular. I then Phoned Amy and spoke to her friend too, she was weird, she didnt say much. Hehe!

Amy went to Youth Group, so I decided to work more on the site and pay attention to the Bible Study, it was very interesting. I stayed up untill 5:00am and got the sleeping bag out and slept in my chair by the computer, then about 6:00am I fell outta my chair, so I crawled over to my bed to sleep. I wanted to wait up for Amy, but she didnt come back, she must have gone straight to bed from Youth Group. lol.

Today I got up to the wake of my Grandparents charging in my room looking for a Letter and some Pictures that Amy sent me. So I had to wake up and show them. They liked the letter and pictures. ^_^

Hopefully Amy will be online soon, I will keep working on the Christian RPG Site while I wait for her to come! I miss her! :)

Today I did not go to work because I have been depressed since last night. I woke up and just didnt want to do anything exept be with Amy. Its been a tough two days for me, because Amy's Mom does not want her coming over to visit me. I am phoning Amy's Mommie up tomorrow so I can talk to her and explain things, and for my Mom to talk to her too. Hopefully her Mom will start understanding that she will be fine here. Hopefully tomorrow I will feel better once I have spoken to Amy's Mom and to Amy.

After being in the cinema, I came home and came online for an hour, and noticed the JesusFreak Server was down, Jer must of had a power cut in the storm or something, causing the Server to mess up, but its back online now, yay!

I came back online a bit later and Amy was online, we spoke for a bit, then she went for a nap, because she is tired bless her. I am currently listening to some music, I keep playing the same song, its a song Amy asked me to download. I think its a very cute song, and it reminds me of her, so im going to post the lyrics here for something to do...

-----
Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I'd stay up and think of you
And I'd wish on a star
That somewhere you are thinking of me too

Cuz I'm dreaming of you tonight
Till tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Then here in my room,
Dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you even see me
And I wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?

I just wanna hold you close
But so far, all I have are dreams of you
So, I wait for the day and the courage to say
How much I love you(Yes, I do)

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
Till tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Then here in my room,
Dreaming about you and me

Ahhh...I can't stop dreaming of you
Ahhh...I can't stop dreamin

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I'd stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe that you came up to me
And said, ""I love you; I love you too""

Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
Till tomorrow, and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Then here in my room,
Dreaming with you endlessly...

Amy! I love you so much! ^_^"

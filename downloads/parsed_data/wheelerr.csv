So, it's Saturday morning and I'm bored. I really shouldn't be awake right now but my parents woke me up by talking too loud sooooooo I'm up.

I am super excited for tomorrow becauseeee me and dd are GOING TO VERMONT!! woot woot I'm soooo excited. I love march break :) Yeah and we're gonna go snoowwwboooaarddingg which I LOVE so much and we're doing it at my FAVOURITE hill EVER, Killington. So awesome there, I love it. I'm also excited because I like hardly ever see my deirdre anymore :( so we'll be partying/knitting up a storm lol. Yes, knitting ;) And of course we'll be watching a looootttt of Dawson's Creek. Haha you know you looove it. I can't wait. I'm like dying of excitement right now.

Soooo last night was the Boys Night Out/Armor for Sleep/Chiodos concert and I almost like broke my nose lol. Me and Elena were in the front when a crowdsurfer (who WASN'T Joane) came crowdsurfing and I hit my nose on the baracade. Yeah, it hurts pretty bad, but whatever. Another war story I guess. I'm pretty sure it's not broken so it's all good :)
AND DON'T WORRY JOANE I STILL LOVE YOU!! lol

Alrighty well I should probably go pack (which I know I wan't get around to)
EVERYONE HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN ON MARCH BREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE YOU ALL!!!

SOOOOOO

I was talking to Katrina and she told me that I have to write a long journal. So here it is.

So this week has gone by realllllyyyy slowly and I'm happy it's over. We have a PA day tomorrow which makes me especially happy because hen I can sleep in, which I rarely ever do, so that should be fun. I'm not doing much this weekend.. I'm going to see the Curious George movie tomorrow lol it's gonna be so cute :) And other than that not much...random concert on Saturday night and maaaaayybbeee snowboarding on Saturday!!! yaaayyyyyyy :) It's my brother's birthday so we're gonna go to my grandparents on Sunday which is good because I haven't seen them in a while. So yeah that's my weekend, fun stuff.

One reason why my week has been going by so slowly is because I've been sad about what school I'm going to next year. I rreeeaaaaallllyyy don't want to go to Loretto any longer. I hate it. I'm so sick of it, it's too damn depressing there, not to mention most of the teachers that I've gotten are all crap. And most of all, I hate the people. Girls are waaaaaaayy too catty, there's a fight here like every day. It's stupid. I do have a lot of good friends here though and I'll definately try to keep in touch when (or if) I leave. After a lot of arguing with my parents, me and Jam went down to North Toronto to pick up applications to go there but they didn't give us any because we live out of area and it was after February 1st :( Anndd noooww everyone's going to Marshall and I wanna goooo. The courses are sooo much better than the ones here. It would be so muchfun with Jenna who I never see. I've only been there a couple of times but I already love it there. Buuttt my stupid parents are of course being stupid about it. My mom is really overprotective and thinks it's like full of gangs there, when there's probably like even more gangs at Loretto lol. I'm gonna talk to her on the weekend and hopefully she'll come around and let me go. I really doubt it though. My guess is that I'm gonna be stuck at Loretto for the next two years :(

Now, enough with the sadness. Walter (my kitten) just came up and sat on my lap. He's so cute. My dad and brother just scared me because they thought he went outside but it turned out he was just in my room playing. It's all gooooooooood :) Yeahh I'm really bored right now. I was gonna go shopping with D and Elena but that didn't happen so I'm in tonight. It's good though because if I had gone shopping I probably would have seen stuff I wanted but I have no money so I wouldn't be able to get anything. And besides I'm happy to have a night in. I can now go to sleep super early :) I love sleeping so that should be fun hehe. I really should have used this night wisely and done some of the loads of homework I have, but I am waaaayyy too lazy and I need a night to just rest. I've pretty much been on the computer since I got home at like 5:30 and took a shower. Well I did watch some Friends :) Oh man I love that show. I would be watching The OC right now but it's not on :( hahaha. Weeelll I don't really have anything else to say... I'm gonna go to bed now (yeah that's right, it's 9:00! lmaoo)

I hope you all enjoyed my ranting!

"event","See ya bye Toys R Us. Well, I still have Scholastic Books starting on Monday and Scareworld on the weekends. I need some money. I need to be able to budget myself better. I need to stop smoking. It's hurting the budget, not to mention my asthmatic breathing. I need to exercise more. I need to eat less. Less is more. 

I liked the Zorro Rides Again DVD I bought from Toys R Us. I had just read about it in a Zorro book I read. A different Zorro who doesn't use a sword but I still liked John Carroll in the role. I can't wait to see the Legend of Zorro on the 28th of this month. It's the sequel to the Mask of Zorro from 1998 w/ Banderas, Hopkins, and Zeta-Jones. 

Heather and I are no longer seeing or sleeping with each other. She believes in casual sex. Well maybe... I need holes too. :) I'll be over on Saturday to watch Buffy Season 5. So that's cool.

Contacted Don. Dunno why really. Cut his grass for $20 two weeks ago. I think I'm gonna ask him if I could stay w/ him. 'Cuz dad and Ann want me gone by the 29th. 

We'll see what happens."

I'm not even clearing $60 and I'm expected to pay for my food (I wouldn't have a problem had I decent money), gas, and the fucking absurd $220 insurance bill they want by the 27th? I foresee driving w/out insurance and living on a roof like Jim Morrison did. Because this was my last resort after mom's and now that I'm being told that I can't stay past the above date, I dunno what I'm going to do.

Started another week at KB Toys. I like the job but the money is terrible (as previously stated). So all I can hope for is to be hired when I do this second interview tomorrow. Cuz the other numbers I have aren't happening. Please o please.....

"event","Lost my job at Scholastic. Because of a lot of seeing things quite differently. My former boss and I. They close at 5pm and I need to take care of things before 5. Both my bank and insurance place are closed at or before 5. I had an appointment in Wilmington to be at one day at 2 and he didn't want to let me go. What do I do? So I was going to leave early one day and get all my errands done all at once instead of taking multiple times. Well, couldn't do that because the day I planned to do this, he put me on the truck. The day he put me on the truck the car payment was due so the day before I left early. Had Bruce the day after the truck and so had to leave early again. Before I left for Bruce, the lower boss says she and the big boss wasn't aware I needed this time off which I thought was strange because I blatantly remember telling one or both of them my dilemma.

Second part of this is that later that night of the day I went on the truck I contracted an ear infection. Went to work the next day cuz I knew I was getting off early and that I could swing it. So that night I went to Heather's and slept and didn't wake up until mid afternoon. I figured why call because it's not like I can go and work for like an hour or two.

Monday I went in and was told that I no longer had a position there because when I didn't call (sleeping from sickness) he thought I was quitting so he went ahead and did the paperwork.

Screwed myself big time there. Now w/ the car payment due on the 27th w/ no job I fail to see how I'm gonna be able to do this.


Met John Cena at Best Buy Monday night. Was pretty cool. Took Timmy w/ me. Chalk another person on my famous people I've met list, now numbering 7 or 8."

"event","Life for the past two months has certainly been different. Yet another new job and this time a girlfriend. It's been a long time coming. 

The job is steady but I'm equally starting to lose interest w/ it. I can never seem to want to stay at a job for too long. There's never enough work to do. And I can't have that. I always need to be working. I am blessed w/ the fact that I've met probably the coolest boss I'll ever have. But even his snide remarks and name callings in good faith are losing their effect. Fast. I tire of this job. 

Heather is an interesting person for me. I'm not sure I quite understand her. It doesn't help that we're polar opposites. She's a Virgo and w/ me being a Pisces, things always get out of hand. I'm too much floating around all the time and coupled w/ her need to stay on the ground, there's never much of a balance. On the up side of things, it's great to have female companionship once again. However, unlike the previous times, I'm not in love w/ this one and yet she's claimed twice to have it for me. We've gotten into this pattern of watching movies that I bring over and then having to sit thru episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Not that it's bad. I'm growing to like it.

So recently I just spent close to $300 that I didn't have. I'm so fucking impulsive. And now that my car is on the fritz and I have less than a grand in the bank, I've fucking screwed myself again. I told myself that I wouldn't do it again. Yeah right. I knew I shouldn't've gone w/ them to South Street. Of course that now means I'm stuck here even longer. God, I'm such a loser w/ money. If I hadn't spent all this money I'd probably be close to $1000 richer by now. 

Well those are my problems now. I need more self-control.

Now I have to go restart the computer because it's making funny noises."

Scholastic has been alright. Seems like a solid job that I could get to enjoy. Not bad so far. However, it's only been two weeks. But it seems like a place I could stay at for longer than three months. Dropped Adecco because they weren't helping in anyway whatsoever. Then I called in the beginning of March and was told that John (my contact there for nearly 6 whole months) was no longer employed w/ the company. Therefore, he was let go and no one at Adecco knew I had a case there. Explains the reason no one called there to update me on the situation or to send me to another place to work. What a bunch of hoes.

Dad is looking at a place for me where it pays more. So that's cool and hopefully they have an entry-level position available. 

Mark and Beca where here for a short time today. Because my birthday is tomorrow I asked them to visit. Mark bought me a Classic Atari system w/ 20 games on it. Only decent ones are Centipede (bastardized version of the arcade) and that Super Sprint ancestor. Still cool even tho it's not what I asked for.

Tomorrow is the day for me to be king. I've taken the fact that I'm out on the truck tomorrow as a sign that maybe it'll be an easy day. Or........that it could be a nightmare. So hopefully it will be bearable. 

Yesterday I barraged myself w/ an all-out thrash metal assault on my ears. I think I will become deaf before the age of 30 if I keep doing it. Haha."

"event","Once upon a time, there was a Zebra that contemplated itself in a reflection it saw in the water. The Zebra developed a sense of self-awareness.

As the Zebra contemplated things about itself, it became perplexed. It wondered if it was a white animal with black stripes or a black animal with white stripes.

And so the Zebra saw a wise Baboon and thought to ask the Baboon his opinion. The Zebra asked the wise old baboon: ""Sir, am I a white Zebra with black stripes, or a black Zebra with white stripes?""

The wise old baboon looked at him and said: ""You are what you are.""

The zebra was confused, and asked him: ""What do you mean?:

The baboon again said: ""You are what you are!""

Not wanting to anger the wise old Baboon, the Zebra returned to the Savannah.

Discouraged and confused, he told his friend, the Giraffe, about the encounter. The Giraffe, in between munching on leaves, said, and he asked the same question of the Giraffe: ""Am I a white Zebra with black stripes, or a black Zebra with white stripes?""

The Giraffe replied: ""Oh, that's easy - you're a white zebra with black stripes.""

Surprised, Zebra asked how Giraffe knew this.

""Simple,"" said Giraffe, ""If you were a black zebra with white stripes, you'd have asked said 'What I be?' and the answer would have been: 'You is what you is.'""

A newly discovered chapter in the Book of Genesis has provided the answer to the question ""Where do dogs and cats come from?""

1. Adam said, ""Lord, when I was in the garden, you walked with me every day. Now I do not see you anymore. I am lonesome here and it is difficult for me to remember how much you love me.""

2. And God said, ""No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you in spite of yourself.""

3. And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his tail.

4. And Adam said, ""Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal."" And God said, ""No problem! Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.""

5. And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.

6. After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said, ""Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but perhaps too well.""

7. And the Lord said, ""No problem! I will create a companion for him who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not always worthy of adoration."" And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam.

8. And Cat would not obey Adam. And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility. And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved. And Dog was happy. And Cat didn't give a shit one way or the other.

9. One may choose to take a very serious look at why the lovely cat is associated with the Devil.

It was fucking rough. By 1pm my muscles were screaming for rest and I still had another 8 hours to go. I didn't like the job because there were more cons than pros. My arms and hips are so sore I can barely move them.

Cons: 1) the niggers outnumber us 8-2
      2) no set schedule
      3) absurd amt. of hours
      4) niggers aren't favorable to newbies (they won't help you at all)
      5) everyone there is damn ugly, has buck teeth, or talks gay
      6) basically worked 14 hours in the cold, windy weather all day

Pros: 1) Got paid for one day (now I can buy Steve's present)
      2) uhhh, that was it for pros.......----really!!

There you have it. I've quit jobs on the 1st day before. This isn't the 1st time.    Besides, I really don't want to be working around Christmas. I believe the time should be spent on a Giftmas high feeling the spirit and staying w/ your family.

You know, there was this feeling that hit me before the game started that told me  to get a tape out and record the game but I didn't and I wish I had.

This Monday Night Football game was what you call a football game. No blow-outs, no teams sleeping, but a game that went back and forth and a game which I could not tell who was gonna win. 

The last 4 minutes of the game had me on edge. No football game has had me like that in a very long time. Well, no Cowboys game. With 1:45 left to play and 10 points down, the Cowboys came from 29-39 to win 43-39. No team has come back from  behind 10 points after 2-minute warning and won the game.

The Dallas Cowboys team itself ties the Dolphins for winning the most MNF games than any other NFL team at 38.

Again, I rest my case when I say that the Dallas Cowboys are indeed the most successful team in the NFL, ever. Any previous NFL record will attest to that. 

Good night."

I'll ask him. It still pulls to the left which I don't like and the radio is kinda static-y which is gay. No left window still and the rear view mirror is still not up. I showed Mark the gas tank button. He thought it was cool.

And now w/ no job, it'll be gay for a while. I owe Alan like $500 for all he's done for my car. Which would've been like $1500 if I went to a shop. Figures when I get a car, I have no job. The former employees were hired back so they don't need a temp, which is what I am. So tomorrow morning I'm driving to this place to apply.

"event","Holy shit.... Lady In The Water was SUCH a Bad Movie!!!! I really didnt think it would be sooo Bad!!! I mean fuck.. it spelt convoluted in bile across the screen, all while trying sooo hard to be earnest and imaginative.
I mean I was warned, very fairly before deciding on this night of wasted nights to embark into ""a bedtime story for a new generation"" (or some drivel). But no Keegan kept on looking at the pretty holographic cover or the remarkably nymph-ish Bryce Dallas Howard, thinking of how enchanted I was in the first part of the village before being awakened from such haunting visions by an attempt at slight of hand turning into a smack to the head....
And Paul Giamatti!? I dont know what to think aside from the fact that the script consisted not with the use of characters but more endearingly annoying cliche spouts, being manuevered about with such lack of direction, and too much intent by the ""writer"" ""capable of great things""...

Yeesh...
Bedtime for me."

Climate-change report predicts major consequences for Canadian Arctic
Last Updated: Friday, February 2, 2007 | 8:44 AM ET 
CBC News:

Temperature increases expected in the next century could be disproportionately high in Canada, up an average of 10 degrees, scientists said from Paris on Friday, leading Environment Minister John Baird to call for ""real action.""

The top scientists from 113 countries agreed unanimously at the International Panel on Climate Change that mass burning of fossil fuels, land use and agriculture practices are indeed melting polar ice caps.

Faced with projections that say Canada could be particularly hard hit by the effects of climate change, Ottawa is set to put tough emissions policies in place, Baird said Friday from Paris.

""The time for talking about this and studying it in Canada is over. We have to get acting,"" said Baird, adding he would soon be meeting with other world ministers in Paris to discuss how Canada ""can play catch-up"" in reducing emissions.

""The planet's future is at stake,"" Baird told CBC News. ""[Global warming] is a fact and it requires real action.""

Baird acknowledged that the consequences may be particularly dire in Canada, where the temperature increases are expected to be higher in the next century than in most parts of the world.
""If the temperature in the world was to go up by 1.8 to even four degrees, which is the range [projected by the year 2100], that's going to have gigantic consequences for the world, but even more significant for Canada, because we're a northern nation and have huge Arctic territories,"" Baird said.

One Canadian scientist on the Paris panel told CBC News that Canada could heat up by an average of 10 degrees. The change would mean no ice in the Arctic summer.
Time for 'tough environmental policies': Baird

The 21-page summary of the panel's findings released Friday represents the most authoritative science on global warming, which the experts describe as an ""unequivocal"" problem. And the new message to world leaders is that inaction is no longer an option.

That means moving away from voluntary greenhouse gas emissions caps and enacting tough environmental policies, Baird said.

Ken Denman, a Canadian and one of eight key authors of the study, told CBC News from Paris that scientists believe the temperature increases in the Arctic will be double the average increases elsewhere.

""In other words if it says 3 degrees, you might think 6 degrees for the high Arctic,"" he explained.

Denman said river levels in Alberta and Saskatchewan are usually filled with glacial melt in the summers, but ""with much less glaciers and earlier melting, you might expect those rivers to be much lower, [resulting in] less water for irrigation when it's needed.""

In a worst-case scenario, warming could expect to melt the Greenland ice sheets in a millennium, causing a sea-level rise of up to seven metres, Denman said.
Reconsider spending priorities: Suzuki

David Suzuki, Canadian environmentalist and host of CBC's The Nature of Things, said from Halifax on Friday morning that scientists have done their part and the burden has now shifted to politicians.

""There's been a drumbeat of all kinds of weird weather events, and [Canadians] understand that something weird is happening and they really want some action,"" Suzuki said. He pointed to the destruction of B.C. forests by pine beetles surviving warmer winters and the series of freak storms that devastated Vancouver's Stanley Park this winter.

Suzuki asked why Canada doesn't reconsider its spending priorities.

""We don't hesitate to spend $16 billion a year on defence. What is the likelihood that we'll go to war or have hostility directed against us? A heck of a lot less than the 90 per cent certainty that humans are causing climate change right now.""

Rather than aim for cuts of five or 10 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions, he challenged the Conservatives to aim for 60 or 70 per cent cuts by 2050.

But Suzuki also said the report is a rallying call to ordinary citizens to make simple lifestyle changes that could curb the global warming threat."

Fuck this team is a way bigger rollercoaster then WEM could ever build.

In other news my new job is not grooving as cool and mellow as I would have thought.
A total lack of communication with my boss coupled with expectations that may be a bit askew have caused me a fair amount of stress and an even fairer (though some - including me may take exception to the use of the word here) amount of unpaid of overtime. I have now been there scince November. I didnt get to Millwoods till just about December and I am still wondering what is expected of me. I get left tasks to finish without the manpower/time/knowledge to properly deal with them and this has me questioning me own copetence (fuck I am a martr without a cause - man I need a cause). Anyways aside from me being over dramatic and the miss-use of a word laced with allot of power and feeling, things are fine.
I need to get into a course and I need to direct my energies at something other than work and fighting off this fucking cold (DIE FUCKER DIE!!...*cough*).
Anyone want to go for lunch with me (Amber I am looking at you - oh and I lost your number). I work every evening till 9:30 which fucks me over for doing... well anything as it takes me 45 minutes to get the hell out of Millwoods! AcK! I would love to share some food with someone and if you are free early afternoons and sick of doing nothing let me know.

And now for a healthy dose of the gayest most hetero loves of mine:

"event","I love it when your browser decides to die after you spent the last 20 minutes writing a journal entry..
And then you get to write a whole new journal entry trying to convey that which you just conveyed, or essentially trying to convince someone (yourself) that what you wrote may or may not be worth rewriting.
Fuck its awesome...
Other natural highs along the same line:
The fact that the heat in my building was not working until this evening since yesterday causing the toilet seat to become something akin to a nice blanket of cold needles...
Yes what glorious heights I have experienced lately.
Anyways my actual entry had a allot more to do with a ""rekindling"" of my love of converstaion this weekend, where I actually had to realize it was 5 in the morning and for most of the night the multiple conversations I was in went somehere! (I think I am too used to trying to carry on conversations at the bar)
Yay.

Anyways in anyone has any advice of recumbent bikes, let me know :)

"event","HMV staff christmas party tonight, which was a rather bland experience not without its highlights. My favorite local band played which was cool, and I got to know a few of the people whose boss I now am in a better social suurounding then a mall at christmas.
Pinochet dies and it unfortunately means little to me, which maybe hammers home the small life I live. On that subject I have to have a debate as to what a ""small life"" is. Anywaysm apologies for my previous rant which I feel insulted the way people communicate with other. Communication is something that is going through allot of change, in some ways good in some ways bad. I mean I guess it depends on the individual. But anyways I am sorry to attack peoples words and expression,I just hope people use them with the idea of how powerful they can be.
I am going ice skating this week for the first time in... I cant even remember how long. I yearn for the reverence for the outdoors I had was I was young. It is bred out of us today, too early (though saying that implies in some way that there could ever be a time when it was okay - I disagree)
I am stalling my sleep now though.
Goonight, I share my dreams with your reality if I may.

"event","So I didnt need another beer but here I am nursing it and making smartass comments to flames fans on the battle of alberta hockey blog http://battleofalberta.blogspot.com/
Anyways I feel a need to use this wonderful tool known as the ""interweb"" cause, hey I actually have to opportunity to do so which is a blessing that like many in our culture is pissed away without thought our realization. 
Beyond my bitterness to society (yeah I have been reading a little too much) my world is a bit different than what it was. It is highlighted by working a menial job for a large multi-national corporation selling unnecessary crap music to the vacant clueless masses, hoping that something interesting will come and smack me in the face while wishing to be that interesting thing smacking a few faces of my own.
I have a new warm house filled with more useless but asthetically pleasing ""stuff"" where I spend too much time sleeping and dreaming of the things I could be doing. Eh.. I am feeling cynical and lonely, and the more I read the more I loose hope. I need to meet someone, I need to reach out but I have a hermit thing going that is hard to get out of.
As is I dont know why I am writing in this as when I look at my friendslist I see little more than verbal masterbation (NOT THAT THIS IS ANY DIFFERENT). Anyways now that I have perhaps offended people and come across as another whiney, self-obsessed blogger, I am going to wish you who I care for and who care for me the strength to do more.

Then it disapeared and I was afraid to tocuh anything or go anywhere in my room. So after carefully dressing I wrapped myself in a sheet and fleed from my fucking bedroom to the living room. Then I went back to see if it was gone and it wasnt but one of Kaylees cats heard it and decided to try and eat it. She scared it out of the room again, finally. 

However now I cant get back to sleep despite how exhausted I am... I hear buzzing everywhere.

This whole thing is weird as my friend got woken up by a bumblebee stinging her just the other day.

I however have unfortunately lost something dear to me. I may have lost it at New City, so if anyone knows of a multicolored scarf found at new city (made of knit raw silk) please let me know. I will be stopping off there tomorrow to see if maybe it was turned in.

"event","Well, despite all worries and fears my house warming party went off without a hitch....
Except for missing a few people who had said they were coming..
Anyways I have ended up with a surplus of wine and a deficit of money, but that should right itself in the next bit...
Thank you for all who attended... love.

Torstien's show was really enjoyable. Went CD shopping (bought way to much) and for Indian food, and listened to some truely lovely music. The only bad part of the evening was the two stupid-drunk rap/jock dudes and having being hit on in the most intense and obvious way I have ever been hit on by a guy in life, from one of them... I laughed and cried and yeah.. A night to remeber.

Tommorow will be cleaning, setting up my room more and then starting the renovations at work. Should prove interesting...
For now I shall lament the things I am lacking, and celebrate the things I have..
I hope you all become aware of your fortunes and the worthlessness that will sometimes accompany them...

"event","I am sitting in a pit of nihilism.
I can look up and see the sky and yet I dont really feel like getting up out into it.
I mean its not like I can see anything but the sky anyways,
and I dont have wings so there is no use in stressing myself out over a place I really dont belong.
Maybe its the winter but my connections to that which matters to me have dwindled,
and I have but one vein running off to a place I have never been, and will probably never go.
The rest feels like dried up roots connected to the waters of my past,
and all that is is just dead weight, and its heavy to haul around.
But I am not willing to hew them off, I am bad at severing things.
They just dry up and die off.. like things are doing now..
I going to go through boxes today and I am going to give up on it soon after.
I dont have plans... and I dont have you."
